 "The bird a nest, the spider a web, man friendship."

William Blake, Proverbs of HellEXT. SAUVIE ISLAND / COLLINS BEACH - MORNING - CONTINUOUSThe day is overcast, a light on and off drizzle. The river is
a solemn gray expanse.

In the distance, a huge cargo barge grinds towards port, its
long, globe-crossing journey almost at a rest.

Up on the wet sand, JORDAN and TAKUYA are stirring. In need
of coffee, they attempt to get a fire going with a bundle of
store-bought logs.

On the waters edge, BRUNO, fetches a stick, runs and drops it
at the feet of twenty-seven year old TERI.

In her rain jacket, Teri picks up the stick and throws it
further down the beach.EXT. SAUVIE ISLAND / COLLINS BEACH - CONTINUOUS - MORNINGAs Teri wanders the beach, she finds a head of cabbage, a
bundle of radishes, a melon. She pokes at some of the
groceries washed up on shore with a stick.

Bruno lopes ahead.

Teri follows.EXT. SAUVIE ISLAND BEACH-SANDY TRAIL-MORNING - CONTINUOUSTeri turns onto a sandy trail leading back into the brush,
leaving the beach behindEXT. SAUVIE ISLAND MEADOW - MORNING - CONTINUOUSTeri and Bruno enter a tawny meadow banded by cottonwood and
maple. The ground is damp. The dead grass is matted.

Bruno rushes ahead to investigate something on the ground. He
barks and begins excitedly to sniff.

Teri goes over to join him.

Bruno stands anxiously near something white and rounded
embedded in the earth. He's eager to share.2Teri looks closer.

She kneels, and wipes wet mud away.

It's a human skull.

She stares at it, worried at first, but also intrigued.

She holds Bruno back and looks around. No one else is around.

She pulls a phone from her sweater pocket and finds no bars,
no reception.

She snaps a photo of the skull, and returns the phone to her
pocket.

Bruno hovers, waiting impatiently.

Teri crouches again and touches the remains. The wet dirt
scrapes off and more bones are revealed.

She gets down on her knees and starts unearthing.EXT. SAUVIE ISLAND MEADOW - LATE MORNINGThe sun peeks through the cloudy sky. The drizzle has let up.

Jordon and Takuya walk down the path that leads to the
meadow.BEGIN CREDITS:In a chunky sweater and wool cap, Teri continues her
excavation, carefully digging around the bones.

Bruno explores nearby, happy to be in the open air.

Already, a human skeleton is uncovered. Skull, clavicle, rib
cage, pelvis, all still in proper order, exposed by recent
drought followed by hard rains. She keeps going.EXT. SAUVIE ISLAND MEADOW - AFTERNOONThe sun is slanting into afternoon.

Teri's cap is off, her sweater unzipped. She eats a power bar
and drinks from a thermos as the boys dig. The three of them
take turns, working two at a time.

Bruno is stretched out chewing on a stick.

The skeleton is fully visible now. And more:3A second skull.EXT. SAUVIE ISLAND MEADOW - LATER DAYThe afternoon is aging. The sun has disappeared and the light
rain has returned.

Two complete skeletons, the forms intact, only loosely
jumbled by the passage of time.

Teri, Jordon and Takuya, stare at the remains with amazement
and reverence,.

The skeletons lie side by side, holding hands.END CREDIT SEQUENCEEXT. WOODS NEAR CAMP - CIRCA 1820 - DUSKA dense rain forest.

On the ground, ferns and moss-covered rocks and
disintegrating trunks. Overhead, a canopy of needles and
lichen-draped limbs. All around, the fir trees form
melancholy aisles into the gloom. The last light of day sifts
through.

OTIS "COOKIE" FIGOWITZ, the hired cook for a fur trapping
expedition, prowls for mushrooms. He's bearded, tentative,
and dirty.

From the distance, rough laughter and yelling drifts to his
ears. Men's voices muffled by the woods.

He walks deeper into the woods clutching his basket.EXT. WOODS NEAR CAMP - CONTINUOUS - DUSKCookie keeps hunting. The voices fade and disappear.

He's alone in the silence of the primordial forest. He can
hear the smallest sounds of crackling twigs, scurrying bugs.

He finds some mushrooms and puts them in his wicker basket.EXT. WOODS NEAR CAMP - CONTINUOUS - DUSKCookie bends to examine a bug. His own breath is the only
sound.4The bug is shiny and desperate. The bug can barely scramble
through the moss.

Cookie helps it along. He watches the bug scurry into some
ferns.

He's still watching when he hears a noise, like a footstep,
not far away.

He pauses. He crouches still. Another crunching, foot-like
sound.

He waits. The woods are darkening. Every direction is the
same tangle of greenery.

Another foot fall.COOKIEHello?

No answer.COOKIE (CONT'D)Who's there?

No answer.

Another rustling sound. He panics. He picks up his basket and
starts walking briskly away.

He hears footsteps behind him and looks behind, seeing
nothing.

He starts jogging. Soon he is sprinting through the trees
chased by the sound of his own footsteps.EXT. CAMP - CONTINUOUS - DUSKCookie runs into camp. A few ramshackle tents, sleeping DOGS,
and a partially unpacked sled piled with pelts and supplies.

Scattered around a fire are FIVE ROUGH-LOOKING MEN, each
alone among the group. They sit smoking, whittling, chewing
tobacco. One stabs a log with a dagger. Another shakes a rock
out of his shoe.

They barely look up as Cookie catches his breath and tries to
hide his terror. They pass a bottle of alcohol around. The
dirty tin plates and spoons of their last meal lie cast
about.5JACK TRAPPER 4(noticing Cookie)
          Cookie. How about some of that
          buffalo steak for breakfast? With
          the fried cakes?COOKIEWe finished all that back in
          Colter's Hell--DAME TRAPPER 2What about soda bread?CLYDE TRAPPER 3Dried apple pie.COOKIENone of that left, either, I'm
          afraid.

The men brood, passing the bottle.CLYDE TRAPPER 3You find anything out there
          tonight?COOKIESome mushrooms. And a digger
          squirrel. I had the squirrel. But
          it got away.CLYDE TRAPPER 3What's in the larder?

Cookie is slow to answer.COOKIETen dry biscuits. Some jerky. Salt.CLYDE TRAPPER 3Nothing else?COOKIENo.

A long silence.CLYDE TRAPPER 3It's the cookie's job to improvise.
          This is a land of abundance, Mr.
          Figowitz.

Cookie is silent, on the spot.6CLYDE TRAPPER 3 (CONT'D)You're charged with finding our
          vittles until we reach Fort
          Tillikum. You're aware of that, I
          know.

One trapper has been hogging the bottle. Another trapper
rises.BILL TRAPPER 1Hold up there, mister. Share the
          wealth.

The trapper takes one more swig and the other one yanks the
bottle away, which causes some liquid to spill.

They rise and start menacing each other.DAME TRAPPER 2Hey there, that's a waste, bud.BILL TRAPPER 1He's drinkin' more'n his share.JACK TRAPPER 4Now no one's got it.

Cookie slips away into his tent.INT. COOKIE'S TENT - CONTINUOUS - INTO EVENINGCookie, among the few pots and pans and utensils sits and
pulls off his boots. He pokes his finger through a hole in
the sole.

Outside the sounds of punching, yelping, the crashing of
branches.EXT. WOODS NEAR CAMP - CONTINUOUS - NIGHTCookie wanders the woods with his basket again.

He finds some mushrooms and gladly scoops them into his
basket.

He watches the moon shining brightly on the trees.

Faraway, a coyote howls.

He moves a little farther along.

An owl stares from a tree branch.7Cookie stares back. The owl's eyes are wide and penetrating,
seeing into Cookie's mind.

The owl takes flight.

Cookie is again alone.

As he turns to move on, he spots a discarded plate sitting on
a fallen log next to a bush. There are a few beans left on
the plate.

He goes over to retrieve it but when he tries to lift it the
plate remains in place. He pulls again but it won't budge.

He looks closer and notices a man's finger holding the plate
down. The finger is attached to an arm that extends from the
bush.

In the bush is a NAKED MAN. He stares out at Cookie.

Cookie stumbles backwards, shocked and afraid.NAKED MAN(quietly)
          Hello.COOKIE(quietly)
          Hello.

They stare at each other in the darkness. Two men in the
primordial wood. The strange man has disheveled, black hair,
a two-inch scar running from his shoulder down his arm, and
dark almond eyes.COOKIE (CONT'D)Are you... all right?NAKED MANHungry.

Cookie nods, and realizes the man is completely naked. He
seems slightly dazed.NAKED MAN (CONT'D)Your cook has retired for the
          night?COOKIENo, I don't think so.NAKED MANYou can call him out here? For a
          moment?8Cookie examines the naked man in the moonlight.COOKIEI'm the cook.

The man takes this in.

From the bush the naked man rises. He steps out and sits on a
log.NAKED MANI see. I've been walking for a long
          time... might stay here awhile.

Cookie watches him, debating with himself what to do.COOKIEWait.

Cookie goes.

The naked man sits and waits, watching.

He keeps waiting. He's totally depleted, resigned.

Eventually, Cookie returns with a dry biscuit, a piece of
jerky, a jug of water and a blanket.

Cookie hands him the food.

The naked man wraps the blanket around himself. He sits on
the log opposite Cookie and gobbles the food down. He's
ravenous.COOKIE (CONT'D)You speak good English... for an
          Indian.NAKED MANI'm not Indian.COOKIEOh.NAKED MANChinese.

As the eating ends, King-Lu takes a drink of water from the
jug.COOKIEI didn't know there were Chinese in
          these parts.9KING-LUEveryone is here. Everyone wants
          that soft gold. It's why you're
          here, isn't it?COOKIEWe've trapped our share.

They sit in the dark. Cookie keeps his eyes on the stranger.COOKIE (CONT'D)What's your name?NAKED MANKing-Lu. So they call me. You?COOKIEOtis Figowitz. They call me Cookie.KING-LUGood to know you.KING-LU (CONT'D)There are some Russian men chasing
          me. Have you seen them?COOKIENo.

King-Lu seems mildly relieved within his weariness.COOKIE (CONT'D)Why are the men chasing you?KING-LUI might have killed one of their
          friends.COOKIEOh.

King-Lu gathers his thoughts, stares at the ground. He sighs
and holds his head.KING-LUChenamus...my friend...they called
          him a thief. They gutted him from
          neck to loin.

Cookie listens intently.KING-LU (CONT'D)I had a pistol and I took a shot. I
          got one in the neck, I think.(MORE)10KING-LU (CONT'D)Then they came after me, and I ran
          into the woods.

King-Lu shakes his head at the memory of it.COOKIEWhat happened to your clothes?KING-LU(remembering)
          I stuffed them in hollow trees.
          Threw my gun in a creek. (sighs)

King-Lu is obviously traumatized.

Cookie observes him in the dark.KING-LU (CONT'D)(More to himself)
          His insides fell out right there on
          the ground. I can still hear it.

King-Lu simply stares now, exhausted by the telling.COOKIECome on. You can sleep.

Cookie helps him up.EXT. CAMP - CONTINUOUS - NIGHTCookie and King-Lu creep past the sleeping men, the dogs, andA HORSE.King-Lu seems worried, peering at the white trappers snoring
and tossing on their bedding.INT. COOKIE'S TENT - CONTINUOUS - NIGHTCookie hides King-Lu on a mat among his supplies.
Immediately, he's asleep.

Cookie lies nearby, unable to sleep. His mind ablaze.INT. COOKIE'S TENT - MORNINGThe morning sun casts shadows on the tent walls.

Cookie awakens.11The sound of gruff conversation. Somewhere, the men are
exchanging words.

Cookie sees that King-Lu is gone.

He pulls back his tent flap and looks out across the camp to
see...INT. COOKIE'S TENT / EXT. CAMP - CONTINUOUS - MORNINGAt the edge of camp, Trapper 3 speaks to a RUSSIAN TRAPPER---
fur bonnet, long moustache, long rifle, long knife.

The Russian's words float over to Cookie's ears. The Russian
seems angry. The trapper nods with understanding, and some
impatience.SABONIS RUSSIAN TRAPPER...a fool... a little mongrel son
          of a whore... when we find the
          whoreson he'll wish he never set
          foot in this shit forest.CLYDE TRAPPER 3... So what I'm hearing is two days
          all told, is that right? Or
          sometime early on the second
          day?...SABONIS RUSSIAN TRAPPERTwo days, the most.CLYDE TRAPPER 3So not too late that day...SABONIS RUSSIAN TRAPPERNot late, if fast.CLYDE TRAPPER 3If you make good time, I
          understand... Ford the river about
          midday...SABONIS RUSSIAN TRAPPERAfter falls, after falls. Midday,
          no. What's that? This time of year,
          midday is early.CLYDE TRAPPER 3After the falls... whenever you get
          there. Right.12Some final pointing and nodding goes down between the
trappers. And at last the Russian leaves, stalking into the
greenery of the woods.

As Trapper 3 ambles back to the center of camp, the other
trappers are just rousing.

He speaks to everyone in ear shot:CLYDE TRAPPER 3 (CONT'D)Move out! We got directions! North
          and west to Fort Tillikum. Two
          day's journey. Hit the river and
          head downstream. Downriver at every
          branch.

The trappers grumble their pleasure.

Cookie closes his tent flap.CLYDE TRAPPER 3 (OS) (CONT'D)Oh, and there's a murderer in the
          woods so stay close!

Cookie takes in the new situation.EXT. WOODS BETWEEN CAMPS - LATER - DAYThe trapping party slogs through the rain forest. Each
trapper carries a bundle of beaver pelts on his back.

The horse pulls the sled of cooking supplies and provisions.

Cookie trails towards the rear carrying his own heavy load.

A trapper, Dame, plays a Jew's harp until another trapper,
Bill, bats it from his hands.

Cookie keeps walking. He pulls near the sled. He spots King-
Lu in hiding among some blankets.

Their eyes meet. They say nothing.

Cookie keeps walking. He looks at the horse to see if he
detects signs of obvious burden from the added weight he
hauls.EXT. WOODS BETWEEN CAMPS - LATER - DAYThe trapping party continues slogging.13JACK TRAPPER 4I need food. Food!BILL TRAPPER 1Food! (mumbling to himself)
          Stupid, pathetic trees.JACK TRAPPER 4I'll shoot somethin.CLYDE TRAPPER 3The Russian said the elk are gone
          this time of year.DAME TRAPPER 2What else he say?CLYDE TRAPPER 3The Russian said the company is
          paying three silver ingots for
          every beaver pelt, two copper for
          muskrat. Your choice of Spanish
          heads or Chinese sycees. There's
          beer at the fort. And other things.JACK TRAPPER 4Women?CLYDE TRAPPER 3More than one.

The men grumble, emboldened. They march on.EXT. WOODS BETWEEN CAMPS - SOON - DAYCookie walks alongside his provisions sled pulled by the
horse.

He can see King-Lu's foot exposed under a blanket. He covers
him.

They keep walking.EXT. RIVERSIDE CAMP - LATE AFTERNOONThe sleds are stopped.

The sound of a rushing river can be heard.

The sun is setting.14CLYDE TRAPPER 3We go down river from here. A day
          more. We can camp here for the
          night. We'll find the fort
          tomorrow.

The trappers hurrah. One man wanders off to piss; another
starts setting up his tent; two others start joking around
with each other, wrestling among the rocks.

Cookie can see King-Lu peering from under the blanket.JACK TRAPPER 4(calling from nearby)
          I'm hungry as hell, Cookie! Find me
          some food.CLYDE TRAPPER 3We'll be there tomorrow. Eat your
          hand.JACK TRAPPER 4I want food tonight. Or I'm takin
          it out of this one.

He comes over and shoves Cookie.JACK TRAPPER 4 (CONT'D)I'm sick of looking at this one.
          Can't wait to be done with him.
          Can't wait to never see him again.

He shoves Cookie again.JACK TRAPPER 4 (CONT'D)You get your cut at the fort, then
          we can see if you keep it. I'll be
          waitin for you outside the gates.
          Waitin for you with your sack full
          of silver.CLYDE TRAPPER 3Leave him alone.

The trappers square off and Cookie scurries away.EXT. RIVER NEAR RIVERSIDE CAMP - MOMENTS LATER - LATEAFTERNOONFlustered and afraid Cookie wanders down to the river.15EXT. RIVER SIDE - LATE AFTERNOONHe goes to the river's edge and looks into the water.

The water is teeming with fish. Fish everywhere. Big, meaty
salmon with silver skin.

Cookie hurries back up to the camp.EXT. RIVERSIDE CAMP - CONTINUOUS - LATE AFTERNOONCookie locates a butterfly net among his things.

He pulls a basket from his pile, too, and as he looks over at
the supply sled he sees trapper, Bill, digging for something
among the blankets.

Cookie catches his breath, afraid for King-Lu.

The trapper rips out some boxes and rope. He gives Cookie a
cold look.

But no King-Lu.

Cookie is relieved. He doesn't wait around.

He heads back down to the water.EXT. RIVER NEAR RIVERSIDE CAMP- CONTINUOUS - LATE AFTERNOON /DUSKCookie wades into the river. He dips his net in the water and
lifts out a silver salmon.

He tosses it on the bank and dips again, catching more.

He stumbles along, pulling fish from the river.

He spots his blanket near the water's edge.

He looks out and sees the receding figure of King-Lu swimming
across the river.

Cookie watches him swimming strongly towards the other side.DISSOLVE:EXT. SHIP IN THE FOG - TWO WEEKS LATER - MORNINGThrough the thick morning mist, A COW appears.16The animal seems to be floating over the river.

The lapping water is even and hushed.

Soon a ferry boat comes into view, piloted by a SWARTHYSAILOR MAN.The ferry floats upstream, carrying the cargo of the cow.EXT. FORT - RIVER BANK - MORNINGOn a sandy beach, a MULTNOMAH BOY skims a rock.

The ferry boat is beached.

A sailor leads the cow off the ferry, onto the shore.

SOME WORKERS stop to watch.

A MULTNOMAH MAN and WOMAN with a BABY on her back, gather and
watch as the cow arrives on land.

THOMAS, a junior fur company guard, approaches, handing
papers over to the sailor. The sailor looks at the papers and
shrugs. He gives the reins of the cow to Thomas.

Thomas leads the cow over the sandy beach towards the misty
trees.

DESMOND, a MULTNOMAH MAN watches them go.

Up the bank wait the walls of a trading fort.EXT. WOODS NEAR FORT - DAYA ROUGH-LOOKING MAN ambles along a forest trail, counting
silver coins (or Fort coupons). Over his shoulder is a pair
of pants, on his head two hats, around his wrist a mahogany
cane, on his face a satisfied smile.

Behind him, Cookie, cleaner, with shorter hair, sits on a
stump, putting on a new pair of boots.

Satisfied with his purchase, he leaves his old boots behind.

Cookie walks around a bend and passes a bloodied knife on the
ground.

Further along, some bushes and piles of debris. Among the
local population's refuse, Cookie spots a BODY. Is it alive?
He can't tell. All he can see are bare legs, stockinged feet
that stick out of the bush.17He peers at the body a moment longer but doesn't want to
investigate.

He hurries on.EXT. PARSON'S - DAY - SOONCookie, walks through town, getting used to his new boots.

The new boots are fetching in his eyes, and fairly
comfortable.

He passes ERIC, a trapper, who is heading in the opposite
direction, holding a pig he has just stolen.

PARSON, who lives at the edge of town, is carrying the week's
supplies back to his shack. He stops and takes notice of the
man with the pig and then Cookie.PARSONFancy boots, lad!EXT. FORT - DAY - SOONThe trading fort is a simple cluster of wooden shacks
surrounded by a sturdy wooden fence. Atop a stripped post
flies the flag of the trading company.

Outside the fence, imposing fir trees and a drab flea market
at the edge of the world.

A few INDIANS, RUSSIANS, BRITONS, and FRENCHMEN barter back
and forth on blankets laid with nails, herbs, knives,
whatever might have some value. A LAZY GUARD loiters near the
main gate.

Cookie, with his new boots, walks among the MEN and WOMEN,
lonely. He overhears snippets of conversation floating
through the drizzle. They talk about trade, weather, gossip.

His feet slurp in the mud as he rounds the corner of the long
fence.

He passes TWO MEN.MAN #1 (OS)Those look like Jean-Baptiste's
          boots.MAN #2 (OS)How the hell would I know?18Cookie walks to the edge of "town."EXT. WOODS NEAR FORT - DAYA LITTLE GIRL with pigtails in a gingham dress, carries an
empty wooden bucket.EXT. EDGE OF FORT - CONTINUOUS - DAYCookie sits under the boughs of the fir trees, untucks his
pant legs from his new boots. He counts his money. A stack of
fort coupons.

Now where to go?

He sits on a stump, with nothing to do.

The LITTLE GIRL with the empty wooden bucket comes out of the
woods and passes Cookie.

He watches her walk gaily towards the fort, swinging her
bucket.

He follows her.EXT. FORT - CONTINUOUS - DAYThe little girl wanders past the traders Cookie just left.

She enters the fort's walls. And Cookie enters behind her.INT. FORT - CONTINUOUS - DAYA guarded warehouse for furs. A watchtower. A saloon. A
kitchen garden.

The little girl wanders across down the single row of ad-hoc
buildings.

Cookie follows.

She goes into the saloon, passing through it's burlap door.

Cookie waits outside.

He can hear the boisterous sounds of the saloon's PATRONS
from outside. Laughter and the stomping of boots.

Soon, the little girl exits with her bucket sloshing with
beer.19She belches loudly and walks past Cookie, and back out the
gate of the fort.

Cookie has nowhere to go but into the saloon.INT. SALOON - CONTINUOUS - DAYCookie enters the bar.

The air is hot and filled with smoke. It's a long, dirty room
with a wood stove and a tattered blanket on the wall. Some of
the men speak the Multnomah trade jargon.

He sits at the bar facing himself in the long mirror. He
looks small and pale compared to the rough men around him.
Timidly, he orders:COOKIEWhiskey, please.

The drink appears.

The bartender waits for payment.COOKIE (CONT'D)How much?

Cookie holds out his money. The bartender takes two coins.

Cookie sips his drink as the PATRONS-soldiers, sailors,
trappers, Indians, etc.---keep laughing and gambling, playing
poker and mahjong. The bar is filled with competing voices
and competing stories. The men talk about health problems,
grand plans, card games, foreign countries. All the talk
mixes together and cancels each other out.

Among the conversations, Cookie picks up on one in
particular, and tries to catch some of its details.LLOYDFirst one in the Territory. Shipped
          it all the way up from Saint
          Francisco.SAILORSaint Luis Obispo.

Lloyd is annoyed by the interruption but the drunken sailor
doesn't seem to notice.LLOYDI'm told Saint Francisco.20SAILORSaint Luis Obispo. I spoke to the
          ferryman.LLOYDThe ferryman... Never trust a
          drunken ferryman. Your mother never
          told you that?SAILORHe wasn't a drunk.LLOYDHa! You don't think so? You've seen
          his hand in the morning? He's
          always drunk, that one. Or sleeping
          it off.SAILORHe seemed fine to me.LLOYDHis blood is whiskey.SAILORWell, he said Saint Luis Obispo,
          and he was the one bringing the
          cow.LLOYDHave it your way, Saint Luis
          Obispo.

Lloyd directs his story to the man across from him.LLOYD (CONT'D)The Chief Factor ordered two cows
          and a calf. That's the true story.
          But the other ones died on the way.MANWhat good's one cow to anyone? Cow
          needs a stud.

The sailor nods.LLOYDChief Factor wants milk in his tea.
          (putting on airs) Like a proper
          Englishman.MANLike a proper lady.21They laugh.MAN (CONT'D)This ain't a place for cows. God
          would've put cows here if it was.LLOYDNo place for white men either then.

Cookie listens, imposing himself into the cow's part.

As Cookie sips his drink and eavesdrops, a BIG, TOUGH-LOOKING
MAN walks into the saloon. With him is a BABY, swaddled, in a
basket.

They sit beside Cookie at the bar. The big guy orders a beer.
He sets the baby on the bar.

Cookie keeps to himself, making eyes with the baby.

Behind him, a bar patron, PAT, has noted the new arrival and
can't keep his mouth shut.PATWell, look who's here. Brilliant
          William.

The bartender gives William his beer.PAT (CONT'D)I need a few sun beams, William.
          Can you gather me up a dozen sun
          beams? They're on the ground, just
          lying around everywhere. Any old
          beams will do.

The big guy ignores the show off, PAT. He drinks and stares
at the bar.WILLIAM(mumbling to himself)
          Sonsabitches.PATHere's a question. What does a
          tongue taste like? You ever think
          about that? I bet you have some
          distinct notions about what your
          tongue tastes like, am I right
          William?

Some of the other men in the saloon laugh.22William is not pleased but stays focused on his drink. Only
Cookie can hear him mutter:WILLIAMTraders all sonsabitches.

Pat gets up and comes near William. Pacing behind him.PATWhatcha sayin there Brilliant
          William? Something brilliant, I'm
          bettin. He's always good for some
          clever opinions. What's the
          difference between a river and
          lake? You figured that one out yet,
          Willy?

The bartender gives a warning glance.PAT (CONT'D)I'm not bothering him. I'm just
          askin an honest question. What
          about the chicken and the egg? He
          knew for sure it was the chicken.
          Til he thought about it from the
          egg's point of view. That really
          hurt your old noggin, didn't it,
          William?

He touches William's back.PAT (CONT'D)Yep, yep. I think that's how you
          got this crack in your brain bone.
          (He laughs, tapping William's head)

The bartender shakes his head. William is getting angrier and
angrier. He's staring furiously at the bar, his mouth
twitching.PAT (CONT'D)Willy, you better do something or
          your head's gonna blow.

At last William spins around. He reaches out and grabs Cookie
by the coat.WILLIAMYou watch him til I'm done.

Cookie barely has time to nod yes, before William turns and
slugs Pat in the face, sending him reeling.23William stands and grabs Pat, dragging him across the room
and through the burlap door flap.

Cookie watches as the other men rise and follow too, happily
chanting and yelling their blood thirst.

As the room empties, Cookie sits with the baby basket and
tries to ignore the brutality.

The bartender locks the till and goes to watch the action.

Cookie and the baby sit alone at the bar.

Cookie sighs, looks at the baby. Makes a little face.A VOICEHello, Cookie. I thought I might
          find you here sooner or later.

Cookie raises his gaze and in the mirror's reflection, sees
behind him, a figure sitting across the now-empty saloon.

It's King-Lu, now decently shod, in fine frontier regalia.

Cookie turns, pleased at the sight of a familiar face, but
keeps his thoughts to himself. King-Lu gives him a wide
smile.COOKIEI didn't think I'd ever see you
          again.

King Lu crosses the room with his beer.

The sounds of the fight waft in through the burlap door: the
initial punches, the clamor by some men to stop the carnage,
and now, a full-blown street brawl involving all parties.

King-Lu takes a seat at the bar beside Cookie.KING-LUI was lucky. Those Russian villains
          left the country just after I left
          you. I thought about doing some
          violence to them but they were gone
          before I knew it. Now I'm free and
          easy, right back where I was.

King-Lu sips his beer.KING-LU (CONT'D)Where are all your kind friends?24COOKIEThey mostly went south. Some north.KING-LUBut not you.COOKIENot yet. No one would have me.

A man tumbles in the door and bounces back out to keep
brawling.KING-LUAnd where are you staying in the
          mean time?COOKIEI've got a tent a mile thataway.
          Other side of the hill.KING-LUI've got a place a mile thataway.
          I've got a bottle there, too.COOKIE(unsure)
          Ah ha.

A beat.KING-LU(clarifying)
          Maybe you'd like to come help me
          drink it.COOKIEOh. Of course, I would... but...

He nods at the baby.KING-LULeave him. He is fine.COOKIEBut... He's just a child.KING-LUHe is fine.

Cookie hands the baby a cork to play with.COOKIEYou stay here. Your daddy will be
          back soon.25Cookie and King-Lu exit, slipping away. The fight continues
outside.

The baby sits alone on the bar.EXT. TOWN NEAR FORT - SOON - AFTERNOONCookie and King-Lu walk.

Outside the fort walls, the land is a mix of forest and
meadow, marked by occasional huts and tents, and pathways
worn in the more trafficked areas.

A DOG searches for food scraps.

A BUSINESS MAN, in a suit, sits outside a shack reading a
months old London newspaper. He takes a page from the paper
to cover the bucket of beer near his chair. The little bucket
girl, his daughter, sits on the small porch stringing blue
beads onto a necklace.KING-LU... I've been in these parts close
          to two years now. I've thought of
          leaving more than once, but I sense
          opportunity here. Ships coming in
          and out every week. More raw
          materials than anywhere I've seen,
          and I've been all over.

JAMES PARSONS comes out onto his makeshift porch with his
RAVEN. He takes note of Cookie and King-Lu, watching them as
they pass.COOKIE(returning to the
               conversation)
          You've been everywhere.KING-LUI caught my first trade ship from
          Canton when I was nine. I sailed to
          London, Africa, saw the pyramids.
          Saw the southern cross. This is a
          land of riches, I'll tell you.

Quickly, the homes taper off.EXT. WOODS - SOON - AFTERNOON26King-Lu and Cookie make their way along a deer path, stopping
to check King-Lu's traps along the way. The traps are make-
shift; a scrap of fish for bait, birds pick at the ground
surrounding the traps.KING-LU (CONT'D)I see something in this land I
          haven't seen before. Pretty much
          everywhere's been touched by now...

King-Lu lifts the heavy wood and pulls out a dead squirrel.KING-LU (CONT'D)but this is still new. More
          nameless things around here than
          you could shake an eel at.

King-Lu puts the carcass in his shoulder bag and they move
on.COOKIEIt doesn't seem new to me. It seems
          old.KING-LUEverything's old if you look at it
          in that way. But that doesn't stop
          new things coming into the world,
          does it?EXT. WOODS/MEADOW NEAR FORT/HUTCH - SOON - AFTERNOONThey walk on, lost in their own thoughts.

They arrive at the next trap.

King-Lu lifts the fallen flat rock. Cookie picks up the
smashed squirrel by its tail. King-Lu opens his bag and
Cookie drops the squirrel in.KING-LUWhat I'm saying is history isn't
          here yet. It's coming, but we got
          here early this time. Maybe this
          time around we can be ready for it.
          We can take it on our own terms.

Cookie likes the sound of that.27EXT. KING-LU'S HUTCH - AFTERNOONA rustic cabin at the edge of a meadow. Almost more a pile of
sticks.

Chickens scratch in the yard near a chicken coop and a
woodpile.

A wooden ladder leans against the hutch, on the ground a long
wooden yoke near a barrel of water.

The two men walk inside.INT. KING-LU'S HUTCH - CONTINUOUS - AFTERNOONKing-lu puts his bag of squirrel meat on a wooden table.

Cookie apprises the cottage. A fire pit, a hole in the roof.
Dirty clothes on the dirt floor. A grimy rug.KING-LUNot much to look at, I know.

King-Lu pulls a bottle from a shelf and finds a cup.

He pours a cup and hands it to Cookie. They toast.KING-LU (CONT'D)Here's to something.

They drink.KING-LU (CONT'D)I'll get a fire going. You make
          yourself easy.

King-Lu exits to chop some wood.

Cookie looks around the hovel.

He finds a broom and starts sweeping.EXT. KING-LU'S HUTCH - CONTINUOUS - AFTERNOONCookie shakes out the rug.

another piece of wood.

King-Lu enters with an arm load of wood.KING-LULooks better already!

He starts making a fire.KING-LU (CONT'D)Where're you from, Cookie? I've
             been talking and talking.COOKIEMaryland.KING-LUNever been.COOKIEIt's fine. I don't remember it
             much.KING-LUNot fine enough to stay, eh?COOKIEMy momma died when I was born. Then
             my daddy died. I had to move on to
             find work. Never stopped moving.
             You could say I'm from no where, I
             guess.

A pause of understanding.KING-LUWell, here's to getting out of
             there.

King-Lu fills Cookie's cup again. The fire is catching,
growing into licking flames, throwing heat.MONTAGE OF DAYS:EXT. WOODS NEAR KING-LU'S HUTCH - DAYCookie and    King-Lu gather nuts from the branches of a thick
bush.

Cookie fills his basket.29Close-by King-Lu puts his stash in a sling he's made from his
shirt.KING-LU... Things gain value when you send
          them around, that's the thing. A
          fur here is worth a dollar; a fur
          in Paris, a hundred times that. I
          had an idea once. Furs are one
          thing. But there's precious oil in
          the beavers, too, that's worth
          something in China. They use it for
          medicine over there. If a man could
          take a batch of that precious
          beaver oil on a ship to Canton, he
          could make his fortune.COOKIEWhy don't you?KING-LUOil is in the glands. Glands never
          make it to the fort. Just rot away
          in the woods. Anyway, I don't have
          contacts in Canton. I'm from the
          north, and they hate a Northern man
          there. Worse than a white man to
          them.INT. KING-LU'S HUTCH - ANOTHER DAYCookie's few belongings are now mixed among King-Lu's.

King-Lu debeards mussel shells while Cookie tends the fire
and chops vegetables...KING-LU... What I'd really like is a farm.
          The land south of here is wide
          open. The world wants filberts. Or
          walnuts. Or almonds.

Cookie collects the mussels from King-Lu. He picks off the
last strands that King-Lu missed, puts them in the boiling
water.KING-LU (CONT'D)Something you can pack up and send.
          But you can't just grow a tree, it
          takes time.30EXT. RIVER NEAR KING-LU'S HUTCH - ANOTHER DAYCookie washes clothing and dishes in the river.

King-Lu sits against a rock. He's busy thinking.KING-LU... It's the getting started that's
          the puzzle. No way for a poor man
          to get a start. You can't grow a
          batch of nuts, harvest them, crate
          and ship them to market without
          getting payment on them until
          after. You need capital. Or you
          need some kind of miracle.COOKIEYou need leverage.KING-LUOr a crime.

King-Lu thinks harder.COOKIEI'd like to open a hotel someday. A
          place for travelers.KING-LUHotel. That's nice.COOKIEOr a bakery.

King-Lu gets up and stretches.

Cookie wrings water from a shirt.KING-LUA hotel and bakery. With wild
          huckleberry pies. You could do that
          here.COOKIESomeplace warmer.KING-LUWarmer then.

King-Lu goes over and helps Cookie gather up their load.

Cookie puts his bag over his shoulder, nods to a small black
basalt sculpture across the river.31COOKIEOne black rock.KING-LUThat's a weather stone. It makes
          rain, they say. They say it was a
          monster or a powerful spirit once---
          a Skookum--who got turned into
          stone. If anyone sits on it, it
          rains.

King-Lu and Cookie carry their items, leaving the beach.COOKIEDo you believe in that?KING-LUI believe different things in
          different places. It's good to be
          shifty in a new country. You never
          know who might be writing the rules

coat shines in the sun.

The cow is a glorious creature, even more beautiful so far
from home.INT. KING-LU'S HUTCH - EARLY EVENINGA seasonal rain pounds the roof of King-Lu's hutch. Water
leaks into make-shift buckets and baskets that the men have
set around the place.32King-Lu is mending a pair of pants.

Cookie lights a lantern.COOKIEI found the cow today.


King-Lu keeps mending.COOKIE (CONT'D)It isn't far from the Chief
          Factor's house. In a meadow. I'd
          like some of that milk.KING-LUI'm not a milk drinker. Doesn't
          agree with me.

Cookie brings the lantern over to where King-Lu is sewing and
sets it down next to him.COOKIEI wouldn't drink it. I'd use it for
          cookies, or scones. There's nothing
          better than buttermilk biscuits.
          I'm tired of this water and flour
          bread.

King-Lu finishes mending. He cuts the thread with his teeth.
He shakes out his pants and steps into them.KING-LU(staring at his feet)
          What else would you need for good
          biscuits, Cookie?COOKIEFlour, some sugar, salt, baking

The cow lows softly. Cookie speaks to her softly.COOKIEHow are you? Didn't expect company
          so late at night, did you? Well.
          Here we are.

Cookie kneels and begins milking the cow. The streams of milk
splash in the basket.COOKIE (CONT'D)Sorry about your husband. I heard
          he didn't make it all the way. And
          your calf... That's a terrible

in his sleeping clothes and boots. He drops the wood in the
yard.

He goes to one of the buckets of rain water. He takes a drink
from his cupped hands. As he wipes his hands, Cookie hands
him a fresh biscuit through the window.

King-Lu pulls the biscuit apart and the steam comes out.

Taking a bite, clearly the biscuit is heavenly.INT. KING-LU'S HUTCH - CONTINUOUS - EARLY MORNINGKing-Lu comes in from outdoors.

He takes a seat at the table.

Cookie brings over more biscuits.

They are golden and fluffy. The two men lean over the plate

Cookie and King-Lu eat.KING-LUHow much do you think someone would
          pay for a biscuit like that?COOKIEI wish we had honey.KING-LUA glass of whiskey is two silver

Cookie eats another biscuit.KING-LU (CONT'D)I think we should test the waters.

King-Lu to the edge of town, then watches them go.EXT. FORT - DAYThe drab flea market outside the fort is ongoing. A few
INDIANS, a few TRAPPERS, all peddle their wares on the
blankets. A batch of dried mushrooms. A scatter of beads.
Piles of mussels and clams.

Cookie lays out the blanket on the edge of the market. On top
of the blanket they lay their plank of cedar. On the cedar,
they lay a row of primitive donuts. Fried, sugared, puffy
dough. Drizzled with honey.

share it but Lloyd turns his back to Thomas and shoves the
cake into his mouth.38EXT. EDGE OF TOWN /PARSON'S SHACK- AFTERNOONThe little beer girl walks through the center of town
carrying a full bucket of beer. She delivers it to the
businessman who sits outside his shack reading the same worn
newspaper.

Cookie and King-Lu pass by as the businessman pays the little
girl.

branches of the tree.EXT. COW MEADOW - NIGHTThe moon is high.

In the darkness, Cookie milks quietly, surreptitiously, now
with a milking stool.

Cookie whispers sweetly to the cow, pressing his head against
her side.COOKIEThere now. We made some oily cakes
          with your milk. They were very
          good. We couldn't sell them fast
          enough. A little honey on them. It
          was your milk in the batter that
          did it. What a good, nice girl you
          are.

The cow lows softly.

The moon blankets them.39EXT. FORT - LATE MORNINGTRAPPERS gather round as they set up shop. There are some
Company SOLDIERS in the group, a NATIVE WOMAN, a couple
Native men, returning trappers and Thomas. They jostle and
jockey for the best spot in line.

King-Lu has added a hand-made sign: "Best Oily Cakes East of
Canton."

This time they make the oily cakes on site. They have a fire
and a cast iron skillet with boiling lard. They pour the
batter, pull out the oily cake, drizzle it with honey and
grated cinnamon.

King-Lu makes the customers line up in an orderly fashion.KING-LUOne for each customer, all right,
          men? Seems only fair. You were here

          tastes like something my mama made.KING-LUThat's our secret, boys. Think of
          it as a little taste of home.

The oily cakes go quickly again. The Native men pay in
dentalium shells. Others in silver, gold, blue beads, one
pelt. The last one is sold to a man just behind Thomas who
pushes his money in King-Lu's face, right over the boy's
head.

As Thomas steams, King-Lu takes the money and places it in a
special sack.40INT. KING-LU'S HUTCH - LATER - DAYCookie and King-Lu are back home, their money stacked on the
rustic table. A hodgepodge of coins, beads, a single pelt,

They begin to set up when Lloyd, the Company man, draws near.
Thomas staggers behind him.LLOYD(to Cookie)
          Hold one out today. The Chief
          Factor wants one. He'll be here
          soon.

Cookie hears him. His gaze seeks King-Lu. He lights the fire.

Behind Cookie, Lloyd smacks Thomas on the back of the head
for loitering about.LLOYD (CONT'D)(to Thomas)
          Don't you have some work you should
          be doing? I don't need two shadows,

King-Lu is already selling to the gathered men.EXT. FORT - SOON - MORNINGThe lazy guard snoozes with a gun in his lap. He is roused by
the poking in the ribs with the long end of a decorative
cane.

The CHIEF FACTOR at the entrance of the fort pokes at the
guard.CHIEF FACTORLook alive, sir!

The Factor is a stately, imposing figure, older and more
dignified than anyone else in the territory. He has red-
blonde hair and mutton chops, and wears a waistcoat with
starched collar.42He walks past the line of merchants selling their wares
outside the fort fence.

He walks directly to the oily cake area and comes to a stop.
Cookie and King-Lu look at him expectantly.CHIEF FACTOR (CONT'D)I've heard about your cakes. I'd
          like to try one, if I may. How
          much?KING-LUYes, sir. For you, only ten silver
          pieces.

He pulls his purse from his coat and pays.

Cookie prepares him an oily cake.COOKIEA little cinnamon is nice.

Cookie offers a small grating of cinnamon.

He loves it.CHIEF FACTORI taste London in this cake. A

          this?COOKIEI was indentured to a baker in

ladder, they sneak through the woods.KING-LU(whispering)

Cookie looks back.KING-LU (CONT'D)Another cup is another dozen cakes.
          That's another fifty silver pieces,
          at least.

Cookie goes to the cow.COOKIEHello. Good evening. Back again.
          How are you tonight? You seem well.

Another secret milking begins. The bucket begins to fill.

A faraway dog starts barking.

Cookie's nervous.

Cookie does a questioning owl sound.COOKIE (CONT'D)Who who?

No response. Cookie keeps milking.COOKIE (CONT'D)You've never slept on a feather
          bed. A feather bed is very nice. It
          would be an excellent feature in a
          hotel. But how do you clean a
          feather bed? I don't know. It might
          not be the best idea for a hotel.

Cookie fills the bucket as much as he can bear.EXT. FORT - LATE MORNINGA blot of batter fries in oil.

Cookie flips it. Pulls it out. Drizzles honey on it.

And hands it to the Chief Factor who stands eagerly waiting.CHIEF FACTORVery good.45COOKIEGood morning, sir. Here you go.

King-Lu holds out his hand for payment. The Chief Factor
gives Cookie his money.

The Chief Factor eats.CHIEF FACTORI'm entertaining a small group next
          week. The captain of the Ruby is
          coming for tea. I'm tired of his
          jests about the savagery of life on
          the frontier. Do you know what a
          clafoutis is?COOKIEI do.CHIEF FACTORCould you make one? A good one? He
          loves a clafoutis. I'd like to
          humiliate him.COOKIEWithout fresh raspberries or
          apricots, I'm not sure...CHIEF FACTORHave you tried the bilberry?COOKIEOut of season, I believe.CHIEF FACTORThere are still blueberries on the
          bush. I would pay handsomely for a
          proper blueberry clafoutis.COOKIEIt's a simple enough cake. If the
          blueberry is available, I'm sure I
          can make one.CHIEF FACTORCapital. Saturday then. A
          clafoutis. We'll be dining at my
          residence. You know it's
          whereabouts?COOKIE(on the spot)
          I think I've passed it or know of
          it--46CHIEF FACTOR(departing)

The Chief Factor ambles back to the fort with a spring in his
step.EXT. WOODS NEAR KING-LU'S HUTCH - AFTERNOONCookie hunts. Into his basket go berries that he tickles from
a bush.INT. KING-LU'S HUTCH - NIGHTCookie mixes the ingredients of the clafoutis in a bowl. He
pours the batter into a pan.

As Cookie works, King-Lu lays on his bed talking.KING-LUThe hotels in Saint Francisco are
          grand. We can't compete on that
          scale. But regular travelers need
          shelter, too. A room with a bed,
          that's all. A few rooms near the
          sea. That's a start. And if we
          choose the site very well, we can
          add the garden and the corn rows--

King-Lu trails off, lost in his imaginings.

Cookie puts the clafoutis into their make-shift oven.KING-LU (CONT'D)This is a dangerous game we're
          playing here. The Chief Factor has
          a delicate palate. He'll taste his
          milk in there eventually.

Cookie comes and sits near King-Lu.COOKIEWe can't say no. He'd be
          suspicious.KING-LUWhere does he think the milk is
          coming from?COOKIESome people can't imagine being
          stolen from. They're too strong.47Cookie wanders to stand in the open doorway.KING-LULet's hope he's one of those.

Cookie stares up at the clouds moving across the moon.KING-LU (CONT'D)How much will we charge?KING-LU (CONT'D)20?A gentle owl calls somewhere in the night.KING-LU (CONT'D)25.INT. CHIEF FACTOR'S HOUSE - SOON - AFTERNOONThe GUESTS are collected in the living room.

An American CAPTAIN (n� Ulysses Welt), dressed in nautical
garb; a prominent Multnomah leader, TOTILLICUM, in local
regalia; and his wife, ILLCHE, in a combination of local and
foreign dress.

The CHIEF FACTOR (n� Cheston Plumb) is also there, and the
Factor's wife, CELESTE, a native woman.

A CAT drinks from a small porcelain bowl of milk.

It's a stiff party. They gather around a table with a nice
table cloth, linens, a bouquet of flowers, a glass decanter.CHIEF FACTORHmm, sounds like quite a situation,
          indeed. And in the end, how many
          lashes did you order?

Out the window, Cookie and King-Lu can be seen making their
way up the long path leading to the house. Cookie carries the
cake.CAPTAINTwenty. It was a memorable day for
          that man.CHIEF FACTORA fine number. But for mutiny? It
          seems conservative.48CAPTAINMore than twenty and he would have
          been useless the remainder of the
          voyage.CHIEF FACTORHe was a young hand?CAPTAINNot so young.CHIEF FACTORYou see, here is the rub. When one
          factors the loss of labor from the
          punished hand versus the gain of
          labor from the hands who witness
          the punishment, a stricter
          punishment can sometimes become the
          more advisable path.

Cookie and King-Lu near the residence.CHIEF FACTOR (CONT'D)Sometimes a properly rendered death
          is even useful in the ultimate
          accounting. It can be a vastly
          motivating spectacle for the
          indolent, let alone the mutinous.

Cookie and King-Lu arrive.

A knock at the door.CAPTAINFair enough. But some calculations
          can never truly be made.

A SERVANT lets Cookie and King-Lu in the front door and leads
them to the living room.CHIEF FACTOR(his back to his guests)
          No, there you are wrong, Captain.
          Any question that can't be
          calculated is not worth asking.

The Chief Factor turns to greet Cookie with some pleasure.CHIEF FACTOR (CONT'D)Ah, here he is. Our baker. A baker
          as fine as any you'll find on the
          continent, captain, you'll see.
          Bring the clafoutis over here,
          Cookie. Show the captain.49Cookie brings the cake over. The servant leaves.

The Captain and Chief Factor gather around a small round
table where the cake has been placed. The men admire his
handiwork.CAPTAIN(looking at Cookie)
          Indeed, it is a fine looking cake
          Mister...COOKIEFigowitz.CAPTAINWhat brought you to the Oregon
          Territory, Mister Figowitz?COOKIEChance. I hired on with a trapping
          company.CAPTAINAshley's men?COOKIENo. A lesser crew.CAPTAINThey're trapping out the whole map.
          Won't be any pelts here much
          longer.CHIEF FACTORI disagree. The beaver are endless.KING-LU(standing in the doorway)
          When I got here, there were beaver
          everywhere. Whole cities of beaver.
          Living like people in row houses in
          New York. Smart animals, the
          beaver.

They ignore King-Lu. TOTILLICUM moves from his chair near
King-Lu over to join the Captain and Chief Factor.CAPTAINIn any case, fashions are changing
          in Paris. The beaver hat is on the
          wane.50CHIEF FACTORThe market in China is strong. The
          beaver will always find a home.
          It's too beautiful, too supple.

Totillicum isn't following.

Celeste translates between the men.CHIEF FACTOR (CONT'D)He's saying the men in Paris are
          favoring new hats this season. They
          no longer want beaver fur. I'm
          saying the beaver is forever.

Totillicum responds. Celeste translates.CELESTEHe can't understand why the white
          men hunt so much beaver and never
          eat the tail. The tail is
          delicious.CAPTAINMaybe I will. I'm sick to death of
          salmon already. You can tell him
          that.

An awkward pause. Thankfully, the servant brings tea.CHIEF FACTORAh, here we are.

Tea is poured for the guests, including Cookie.CHIEF FACTOR (CONT'D)Chinese black tea. Very subtle.
          Cream?CAPTAINThank you.CHIEF FACTOREnjoy the cream. My cow gives only
          the smallest amount. She's a lonely
          girl, I'm afraid.CAPTAINYou have a cow?CHIEF FACTORShe arrived only a month ago. Sans
          husband, I'm afraid. I hope to have
          a mate for her within the year.51CAPTAINShe's the only cow in the region?CHIEF FACTORFor at least five hundred miles in
          any direction. Would you like to
          meet her? Let's have a walk. Shall
          we?

Cookie is clearly invited, too.

The men leave the room.

The women immediately become more relaxed.EXT. COW MEADOW - LATE AFTERNOONThe men walk from the house to the meadow.CHIEF FACTOR... What are the fashions in Paris
          this year, captain?CAPTAINThe ladies are moving away from the
          empire silhouette this year. They
          are favoring fuller skirts and
          visible corseting. For the men,
          broad shoulders and puffed sleeves.
          Trousers for smart day wear,
          breeches in court and the country.
          As for colors: canary yellow and
          turkey red are the colors du jour.

Without taking much interest, Totillicum lets the nonsensical
chatter float around him.CHIEF FACTORHistory moves so quickly in Paris.CAPTAINSo quickly it wears itself out. It
          never reaches here at all.

The cow stands alone, chewing grass.CAPTAIN (CONT'D)She looks well enough.CHIEF FACTORAnd yet she barely produces.52CAPTAINWhat's her provenance?CHIEF FACTORA good line. Half Alderney, of
          Isigny, half Froment du Leon, from
          the province of Brittany.

The cow edges towards Cookie. The cow lows softly.

The cow nuzzles Cookie's hand and arm. Cookie pats her flank
and she lows some more.

Totillicum, the Chief Factor and the Captain watch Cookie
petting the cow.

King-Lu watches them watching.CAPTAINShe seems to have an affection for
          you Mr. Figowitz.

          the way. And more cows after that.COOKIEThe Chief Factor...KING-LU... is a fool. Paris this, London
          that. He misses everything right
          under his nose. What kind of woman
          is he?53Cookie doesn't respond.

King-Lu feels a little abashed, realizing he's somehow
bruised his friend.KING-LU (CONT'D)Men like us, Cookie, we have to
          make our own way. There are no
          empire silhouettes and colors du
          jour for us. We have to take what
          we can when the taking is good.COOKIEI know.KING-LUWe'll sell a little longer and then

gets out of bed, putting on his boots.EXT. TREE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHTKing-Lu watches the small light move from one room in the

Through his dimming consciousness An OLDER COUPLE comes into
view.

Across the room, the man sits in a rocking chair, smoking a
pipe. The woman brews a poultice on the stove. They have
white hair, shabby but dignified clothes, and an air of
almost spooky peace.

The room darkens, Cookie is out again.FADE OUTINT. COTTAGE - MORNINGFADE UPCookie again opens his eyes. Through a watery softness, he
sees the couple hovering over him. They appear Hawaiian. The
woman offers him a bowl of steaming fluid.

Cookie smells it and recoils.WOMANDrink, drink. It will make you feel
           better.

Cookie drinks, wincing. He's thirsty.62COOKIE(discombobulated)
           Where am I?WOMANNo one will find you here.COOKIEWho are you?WOMANHave a drink. You'll feel better...

Cookie takes a few more sips, then rests his throbbing head.

He struggles against sleep but the room quickly dims.FADE OUTINT. COTTAGE - DAYFADE UPCookie awakens. He is alone.

Cookie touches his swollen face, his cracked head.

He looks around, trying to focus.

A square mirror hangs on a post across from his bed. Through
it, he can see the old man outside a window. He is doing tai
chi. The motions are slow and mysterious.

The old woman is at the stove.

Cookie watches her from his sick bed as she stirs a large
pot, her shadow large on the cottage walls.

Cookie speaks to the woman from his sick bed. The sound of
his own voice rings in his head.COOKIEI... I need to find my friend.WOMANYou are safe here. Nothing can harm
           you.

The man continues his slow, deliberate motions in the mirror.COOKIEBut... my friend doesn't know where
           I am.63WOMANHe wants you to rest. If he is a
           true friend.

Cooke rests his troubled head on his pillow.DISSOLVEEXT. WOODS / RIVER SIDE - DAYKing Lu emerges from the woods.

He looks around to get his bearings. He walks onto the sand,
takes of his socks and boots and walks on the soft sand.EXT. RIVER SIDE - CONTINUOUS - DAYKing-Lu comes to a sandy hill. In the distance, he sees a
canoe pass along the river.

As comes to the top of the small hill, he spots a beached
canoe.

He walks over and ponders the canoe. A small, wooden canoe,
unattended.

No one else is around.

King-Lu goes closer to the canoe and admires it, sizing up
the situation.

He wonders if and how to steal the canoe, when a Multnomah
man, CHONACHONA, emerges from the brush. With him is A LARGEDOG.Chonachona stands behind King-Lu watching grimly.

King-Lu looks over his shoulder to make sure no one is around
and sees Chonachona.

King-Lu greets him in the trade jargon. They speak in the
shared trade jargon.KING-LUGood day. Is this your canoe? I
           need to get downriver. Can you take

He keeps paddling.

In the distance: another canoe.

The Multnomah man sees the distant canoe. He raises a hand in
greeting.

The ROWER in the distant canoe raises a hand in greeting.

They call out to each other over the water.

Chonachona alters course.

They head for the other canoe.KING-LU (CONT'D)Wait. What are you doing? I need to
          get downriver. Quickly.CHONACHONADon't worry.

They continue towards the other canoe.

King-Lu has no way out.EXT. RIVER - CONTINUOUS - AFTERNOONKing-Lu and the Chonachona pull up next to the other canoe.

In the other canoe is a young Multnomah man, WATUTUM, with a
cargo of acorns.

The two Multnomah men talk in their   native tongue. Watutum
tells Chonachona that two women are   collecting drying salmon
downriver a mile, on the other side   of the river, and there's
a young woman there that was asking   about Coalpo.WATUTUMThere are some women drying salmon
          a mile upriver. The daughter of

King-Lu waits in anger and disbelief.

At last, the other canoe starts to move.

And King-Lu's canoe follows.KING-LUWhat are we doing?

As the Multnomah men come ashore, they call greetings to the
women, who vaguely greet them back.

From the canoe King-Lu watches as his ride goes over and
strikes up a conversation with the younger women, STIZA. She
doesn't seem that interested, though.

Frustrated, King-Lu gets out of the canoe and goes up to wait
on the shore.EXT. CANOE - CONTINUOUS - AFTERNOONThe afternoon is wearing on.

King-Lu paces on the beach, watching Coalpo talk to STIZA.
Chonachona is telling her about a trip to the Celilo market
last year.CHONACHONA... one man from way down south,
          near Shasta, had twenty horses.
          They were beautiful horses. He
          counted them every morning. He
          didn't want to lose any. One
          morning he counted only nineteen.
          He thought someone stole his horse.

          accused everyone...EXT. RIVER SHORE - CONTINUOUS - LATE AFTERNOONWatutum, meanwhile, is taking a nap under a tree.EXT. RIVER SLOUGH - CONTINUOUS - LATE AFTERNOONKing-Lu approaches Chonachona, watching as he hovers around
the young woman dealing with her salmon.

She walks away from Chonachona and he stands near ANOTHER
WOMAN and starts talking to her. He wonders why the first
woman didn't seem that interested. He'd heard she was asking
about him. The woman keeps working, and denies knowing
anything about anything.CHONACHONAI was talking. And she walked away.68Stiza's friend shrugs.COALPOI wasn't done with the story.STIZA'S FRIENDIt took a long time.

King-Lu waits pacing on the beach, while the two continue
talking. It goes on and on until King-Lu can't stand it any
longer.KING-LUI need to go upriver! Take me or
          give me back my buttons!

Hearing King-Lu's voice, Chonachona looks at King-Lu without
expression. He takes the buttons from his pouch and hands two
of them back to King-Lu.KING-LU (CONT'D)All of them.CHONACHONAI took you part way.KING-LUI'm not any closer than I was!CHONACHONAYou are.

The woman looks at the buttons in King-Lu's hand.KING-LU(his hand open)
          I'm not. I'm on the wrong side of
          the river. Give me all of them.
          This wasn't the deal.

Reluctantly, Chonachona gives King-Lu back the rest of the
buttons.

King-Lu is despondent.

The woman says something to Coalpo. She tells him the young
woman he was trying to impress would definitely like those
buttons. He asks if she's serious. She says yes, for sure.STIZA'S FRIENDStiza would like those. She has a
          collection.69CHONACHONAA button collection?STIZA'S FRIENDThose would be a big deal to her.
          She has a box full.

Chonachona turns back to King-Lu.CHONACHONAGive me the buttons back. I'll take
          you downriver.KING-LUI need to go right now.CHONACHONAGood. Let's go.KING-LUNo waiting. No other stops.CHONACHONAFine.KING-LU(sensing his new advantage)

          Fast, three. Slow, one.

Chonachona ponders, displeased. He looks at the woman. She
tells him again that the young woman he likes really likes
that kind of button.

Grudgingly, Chonachona agrees.EXT. RIVER - LATE AFTERNOONThe canoe skims across the water.70King-Lu grimly watches the horizon.INT. COTTAGE - NIGHTCookie rises. His head throbs.

The couple sleeps.

Agonizingly, he leans over to put on his shoes.

He creeps outside.EXT. COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHTCookie makes his way through the darkness to the edge of the
clearing.

He stands before the wall of trees.

He stares blearily into the blackness, hearing the howls of
hungry animals. Nearby wolves. Distant coyotes.

The trees stretch and bend taking on the shape of the wind.
The eyes of many beasts shine in the rolling waves of the
ferns and tall brush.

Afraid, Cookie can't force himself to go farther.

He turns, defeated, and stumbles back to the cottage.INT. COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHTCookie returns to bed, exhausted by his effort. His head
aches.

He closes his eyes but he can't sleep.

He hears stirring.

The old woman rises to tend the fire. He sees her shadowy
shape moving across the room.

She turns towards Cookie. Her face is the skeleton of a cow.

Cookie is petrified.

The woman looks over at Cookie.

Cookie tries to rise but he can't.

His vision is blurred.71The world fades away.EXT. WOODS NEAR KING-LU'S HUTCH - MORNINGKing-Lu creeps through the brush.EXT. WOODS NEAR KING-LU'S HUTCH - CONTINUOUSKing-Lu pauses at a bush. Through the bush he can see his
hutch.

No one is there.

King-Lu waits, making sure the coast is clear.

At last, King-Lu exits the bush. He goes to the hutch.EXT. KING-LU'S HUTCH - CONTINUOUS - NOONKing-Lu approaches the hutch.

Before anything, he stops at the cottonwood tree.

He gets a round of wood to stand on to retrieve the money
sack from the hole.

He can't quite reach it. He pulls it part way out and it
snags on a branch. Now the bag is hanging from the tree.

He tries to unsnag it but he pauses, suddenly alert.

He hears something.

He looks into the distance. He jumps down and kicks away the
round of wood.

Just in time, he scurries away and hides back in the bush he
just came out of.

THREE COMPANY SOLDIERS, led by Lloyd, are marching in his
direction.

They enter King-Lu's abode.

King-Lu can hear things breaking, smashing, thumping around.

hanging over his head.LLOYDHart. Like a deer, a red deer. I

contemplation.EXT. KING-LU'S HUTCH - SOON - EARLY AFTERNOONFinally, King-Lu approaches the now-ruined hutch.INT. KING-LU'S HUTCH - CONTINUOUS - EARLY AFTERNOONKing-Lu goes inside.73The house is a shambles. He begins to put a few things in
bags.

He lifts Cookie's broken butter bowl. He puts it aside.

He picks up Cookie's whisk, also broken.

He sets down the bags. No point in saving any of it.

He picks up a fire poker.EXT. KING-LU'S HUTCH - CONTINUOUS - EARLY AFTERNOONHe uses the fire poker to fetch the money bag.KING-LUWho-who?

No answer.

And he wanders into the woods.KING-LU   (OS) (CONT'D)Who who?INT. COTTAGE - EARLY AFTERNOONCookie awakens.

He is alive.

He is also alone. The old couple are gone.

In the light of day, the cottage is less terrifying. The fire
is out. There is no sign of the night's horror. But a weird
emptiness.

Cookie rises. He looks around. The cottage is dusty and
cobwebs cover the furniture as if they haven't been touched
in a very long time.

He sees a jug on the table.

He goes to drink. But it's dry.

He goes to the door. He slips out.EXT. COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS - EARLY AFTERNOONThe yard is overgrown with weeds and vines. The whole yard is
unkept. No sign of the couple here, either.74Cookie pauses at the outskirts of the cottage's clearing. He
turns to look back at it.

The feeling in the clearing is eerie. The wind is alive,
moving leaves and needles on the dry ground.

It has the feel of a place that has been deserted for a long
time.

Cookie creeps away into the woods. The boughs of the trees
close behind him. He is leaving for good.EXT. STREAM - DAYThomas sits on a log in the woods near a stream. He is still,
holding a rifle in his lap.

He watches Cookie who is across the stream.

Unaware he is being watched, Cookie lays on the ground
drinking the cool water. He washes the dark dry blood from
his head.

He stares into the stream. As the water stills, his
reflection takes shape. He touches his sore head, rubs his
jaw.

Thomas remains still and unnoticed.

Cookie gets up and goes back into the woods.

Thomas watches him go.EXT. WOODS / BLUFF - AFTERNOONCookie climbs through the forest.

He comes to a bluff with a view. He's careful not to leave
the cover of the forest.

the distance.EXT. WOODS NEAR BLUFF - AFTERNOONCookie hikes into familiar ground.

He intuits his way.

Fearful and glancing over his shoulder.75EXT. WOODS NEAR CHIEF FACTOR'S HOUSE - LATER AFTERNOONCookie drifts close to the cow meadow.

small fence.

The cow raises her head from chewing; she looks towards
Cookie; then back to the grass.

Cookie keeps moving.EXT. NEAR KING-LU'S HUTCH - LATER AFTERNOONCookie comes within sight of the hutch.

Is he dreaming? He isn't sure.EXT. KING-LU'S HUTCH - CONTINUOUS - LATER AFTERNOONThe hutch has clearly been violated. Scattered possessions
litter the ground.

Cookie goes over to the cottonwood tree.

He approaches the knothole.

The money is gone.

He's dismayed.

Cautiously, he enters the hutch.INT. / EXT. KING-LU'S HUTCH - CONTINUOUS - LATE AFTERNOONWith sorrow, Cookie surveys the damage.

Broken furniture, tangled rugs, spilled supplies. Already, an
air of dilapidation and abandonment is settling in.

He hears a faint noise and drops to the floor. He crawls over
to the window, and takes a peep.

He spots motion among the trees, his head throbs, his double
vision returns.

At last: a figure emerges.

Is it King-Lu? It is King-Lu.76King-Lu holds the sack of money in one hand and a jug in the
other. He looks at his home with a mournful expression. He
doesn't come any closer, but simply watches, shaking his
head.

Cookie stands and goes to the door.

The men see each other.EXT. KING-LU'S HUTCH - CONTINUOUS - LATE AFTERNOONThey both smile. Their happiness is overflowing.

Silently, joyfully, King-Lu closes the distance. They stand
in the open doorway and embrace.COOKIEI thought you were gone.KING-LUI thought you were gone.COOKIEI'm only late.

King-Lu's smile fades.KING-LUYou're hurt. It's not safe here. We

Cookie feebly nods. He concentrates on walking.

King-Lu looks back, concerned.77EXT. WOODS / SANDY TRAIL - SOON - DUSKCookie is having trouble keeping up with King-Lu.

King-Lu waits, increasingly concerned. Cookie is clearly
hurting.

King-Lu gives Cookie the water jug.

Cookie drinks.

King-Lu watches him, calculating the time, the distance yet
to go. Cookie is obviously in need of rest.KING-LUThis is a good place to rest. We
          should stop. No one can see us
          here.COOKIEWe haven't gone very far.KING-LUWe need to rest.COOKIEI'm fine. We should be on our way.KING-LUWe should travel at night. Better

Cookie accepts the argument, whether true or not.KING-LU (CONT'D)Good. Lie here. On the needles.
          I'll keep first watch.

Exhausted, Cookie lies down on the dry needles. Immediately,
he falls asleep.

King-Lu sits down next to Cookie, realizing he too is
exhausted. He lets out a deep sigh.EXT. WOODS / CLEARING - NIGHTKing-Lu stares at the trees, keeping watch. He strains to
hear the world outside their spot.

In the far distance, he hears the faintest calls. Or does he?
He can't tell. He sees a bird. It's only a bird. They are
alone.78King-Lu looks at Cookie sleeping.

He looks at trees, feeling the money sack in his hand,
weighing his options.

At last, King-Lu puts the money bag on the ground like a
pillow. He lies down beside Cookie.KING-LUWe'll go soon. I've got you.

They clasp hands.

King-Lu closes his eyes. In a moment, he's asleep.

An owl calls.
