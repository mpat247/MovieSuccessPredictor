     based on a novel by Chuck Palahnuik2/16/98--------------------------------------------------------------SCREEN BLACKJACK (V.O.)People were always asking me, did I
                 know Tyler Durden.FADE IN:INT.  SOCIAL ROOM - TOP FLOOR OF HIGH RISE -- NIGHTTYLER has one arm around Jack's shoulder; the other hand
     holds a HANDGUN with the barrel lodged in JACK'S MOUTH.
     Tyler is sitting in Jack's lap.

     They are both sweating and disheveled, both around 30; Tyler
     is blond, handsome; and Jack, brunette, is appealing in a
     dry sort of way.  Tyler looks at his watch.TYLEROne minute.
                       (looking out window)
                 This is the beginning.  We're at
                 ground zero.  Maybe you should say a
                 few words, to mark the occasion.JACK... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...JACK (V.O.)With a gun barrel between your teeth,
                 you only speak in vowels.

     Jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth.JACK(still distorted)
                 I can't think of anything.JACK (V.O.)With my tongue, I can feel the
                 rifling in the barrel.  For a second,
                 I totally forgot about Tyler's whole
                 controlled demolition thing and I
                 wondered how clean this gun is.

     Tyler checks his watch.TYLERIt's getting exciting now.JACK (V.O.)That old saying, how you always hurt
                 the one you love, well, it works both
                 way.

     Jack turns so that he can see down -- 31 STORIES.JACK (V.O.)We have front row seats for this
                 Theater of Mass Destruction.  The
                 Demolitions Committee of Project
                 Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns
                 of ten buildings with blasting
                 gelatin.  In two minutes, primary
                 charges will blow base charges, and
                 those buildings will be reduced to
                 smoldering rubble.  I know this
                 because Tyler knows this.TYLERLook what we've accomplised.
                       (checks watch)
                 Thirty seconds.JACK (V.O.)Somehow, I realize all of this -- the
                 gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is
                 really about Marla Singer.

     PULL BACK from Jack's face.  It's pressed against TWO LARGE
     BREASTS that belong to...BOB, 45, a moose of a man.  Jack is
     engulfed by Bob in an intense embrace.  Bob weeps openly.JACK (V.O.)Bob had bitch tits.

     PULL BACK to wide on...INT. CHURCH MEETING ROOM - NIGHTMen are paired off, hugging, talking in emotional tones.
     Near the door, a SIGN on a stand: "REMAINING MEN TOGETHER."JACK (V.O.)This was a support group for men with
                 testicular cancer.  The big moosie
                 slobbering all over me was Bob.BOBWe're still men.JACKYes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.JACK (V.O.)Six months ago, Bob's testicles were
                 removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He
                 developed bitch tits because his
                 testosterone was too high and his
                 body upped the estrogen.  That was
                 where my head fit -- into his huge,
                 sweating tits that hung enormous, the
                 way we think of God's as big.BOBThey're gonna have to open my pec's
                 again to drain the fluid.

     Bob hugs tighter; then looks with empathy into Jack's eyes.BOBOkay.  You cry now.

     Jack looks at Bob.JACK (V.O.)Wait.  Back up.  Let me start earlier.INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHTJack lies in bed, staring at the ceiling.JACK (V.O.)For six months.  I could not sleep.INT. COPY ROOM - DAYJack, sleepy, stands over a copy machine.  His Starbucks cup
     sits on the lid, moving back and forth as the machine copies.JACK (V.O.)With insomnia, nothing is real.
                 Everything is far away.  Everything
                 is a copy of a copy of a copy.

     Other people make copies, all with Starbucks cups, sipping.
     Jack picks up his cup and his copies and leaves.INT. JACK'S OFFICE - SAMEJack, sipping, stares blankly at a Starbucks bag on the
     floor, full of newspapers and FAST FOOD GARBAGE.JACK (V.O.)When deep space exploration ramps up,
                 it will be corporations that name
                 everything.  The IBM Stellar Sphere.
                 The Philip Morris Galaxy.  Planet
                 Starbucks.

     Jack looks up as a pudgy man, Jack's BOSS, enters, Starbucks
     cup in hand, and slides a stack of reports on Jack's desk.BOSSI'm going to need you out-of-town a
                 little more this week.  We've got
                 some "red-flags" to cover.JACK (V.O.)It must've been Tuesday.  he was
                 wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.JACK(listless management speak)
                 You want me to de-prioritize my
                 current reports until you advise of
                 a status upgrade?BOSSYou need to make these your primary
                 "action items."JACK (V.O.)He was full of pep.  Must've had his
                 grande latte enema.BOSSHere are your flight coupons.  Call
                 me from the road if there are any
                 snags.  Your itinerary...

     Jack hides a yawn, pretends to listen.INT. BATHROOM - JACK'S CONDO - NIGHTJack sits on the toilet, CORDLESS PHONE to his ear, flips
     through an IKEA catalog.  There's a stack of old Playboy
     magazines and other catalogs nearby.JACK (V.O.)Like everyone else, I had become a
                 slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.JACK(into phone)
                 Yes.  I'd like to order the Erika
                 Pekkari slip covers.

     Jack drops the open catalog on the floor.

     MOVE IN ON CATALOG -- ON PHOTO of COFFEETABLE SET...JACK (V.O.)If I saw something like clever coffee
                 table sin the shape of a yin and
                 yang, I had to have it.

     PAN TO PHOTO of ARMCHAIR...JACK (V.O.)Like the Johanneshov armchair in the
                 Strinne green stripe pattern...INT. LIVING ROOM/DINING AREA/KITCHENThe armchair APPEARS.  PAN OVER next to armchair...JACK (V.O.)Or the Rislampa wire lamps of
                 environmentally-friendly unbleached
                 paper.

     The lamps APPEAR.  PAN OVER to wall...JACK (V.O.)Even the Vild hall clock of
                 galvanized steel, resting on the
                 Klipsk shelving unit.

     The clock APPEARS as the shelving unit APPEARS on the wall.JACK (V.O.)I would flip through catalogs and
                 wonder, "What kind of dining set
                 defines me as a person?"  We used to
                 read pornography.  Now it was the
                 Horchow Collection.

     A dining room set APPEARS.  Jack, the cordless phone still
     glued to his ear, walks INTO FRAME and continues.JACKNo, I don't want Cobalt.  Oh, that
                 sounds nice.  Apricot.

     Jack opens a cabinet, takes out a plate.JACK (V.O.)I had it all.  Even the glass dishes
                 with tiny bubbles and imperfections,
                 proof they were crafted by the
                 honest, simple, hard-working
                 indigenous peoples of wherever.

     He rummages through the refrigerator.  It's practically
     empty.  Jack takes out a jar of mustard, opens it and uses
     a butter knife to eat it.INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAYJack, eyes puffy, face pale, sits before an INTERN, who
     studies him with bemusement.INTERNNo, you can't die of insomnia.JACKMaybe I died already.  Look at my
                 face.INTERNYou need to lighten up.JACKCan't you give me something?JACK (V.O.)Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red
                 Seconals.INTERN(overlapping w/ above)
                 You need healthy, natural sleep.
                 Chew valerian root and get some more
                 exercise.

     The Intern ushes Jack to the door.  They step into the...INT. HALLWAYThe Intern walks away from Jack, picks up a chart.JACKI'm in pain.INTERN(facetious)
                 You want to see pain?  Swing by First
                 Methodist Tuesday nights.  See the
                 guys with testicular cancer.  That's
                 pain.

     The Intern moves into the other room.  Jack stares after him.EXT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH - NIGHTJack heads for the front door.INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - NIGHTJack stares at a group of men, including Bob, who are all
     listening to a group member speak at a lectern.  The SPEAKER
     has pale skin and sunken eyes -- he's clearly dying.SPEAKERI... wanted three kids.  Two boys and
                 a girl.  Mindy wanted two girls and
                 one boy.  We never could agree on
                 anything.

     The Speaker cracks a sad smile.  Some men chuckle, happy to
     lighten the mood.SPEAKERWell, she had her first child a month
                 ago, a girl, with her new husband...
                 And, Thank God.  I'm glad for her,
                 because she deserves...

     The speaker breaks down, WEEPS UNCONTROLLABLY.

     Jack watches.  A couple of the men go up to the speaker,
     comforting him, leading him away.  A LEADER takes the stand.LEADEREveryone, let's thank Thomas for
                 sharing himself with us.

     Jack, uncomfortable, joins EVERYONE ELSE:EVERYONE(in unison)
                 Thank you, Thomas.LEADERI look around this room and I see a
                 lot of courage.  And it gives me
                 strength.  We give each other
                 strength.

     Jack looks around.  Many of the men are sniffling, sobbing.
     Jack squirms in his seat.LEADERIt's time for the one-on-one.  Let's
                 follow Thomas's example and open
                 ourselves.

     Everyone gets out of their chairs and begins pairing-off.
     Jack stands, uncomfortable.LEADERCan everyone find a partner?

     Bob, his chin down on his chest, starts toward Jack,
     shuffling his feet.JACK (V.O.)The big moosie, his eyes already
                 shrink-wrapped in tears.  Knees
                 together, invisible steps.

     Bob takes Jack into an embrace.JACK (V.O.)Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You
                 know that chest expansion program you
                 see on TV?  That was his idea.BOB...using steroids.  I was a juicer.
                 Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for
                 racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm
                 bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids
                 won't return my calls...JACK (V.O.)Strangers with this kind of honesty
                 make me go a big rubbery one.

     Bob breaks into sobbing, putting his head on Jack's shoulder
     and completely covering Jack's face.  After a long beat of
     crying, Bob raises up his head, looks at Jack's NAMETAG.BOBGo ahead, Cornelius.  You can cry.

     They look at each other.  Slowly, Jack's eyes grow wet.JACK (V.O.)Then... something happened.  I was
                 lost in oblivion -- dark and silent
                 and complete.

     Bob pulls Jack's head back into his chest.  Jack tightens
     his arms around Bob.JACK (V.O.)I found freedom.  Losing all hope was
                 freedom.

     Jack pulls away from Bob.  On Bob's chest, there's a WET
     MASK of Jack's face from how he looks weeping.JACK (V.O.)Babies don't sleep this well.INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHTJack lies sound asleep.JACK (V.O.)I became addicted.INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHTJack moves into a "group hug" of sickly people, men and
     women.  In view is a sign by the door "Free and Clear."INT. OFFICE BUILDING BASEMENT - NIGHTJack stands with a weeping middle-aged WOMAN.  He begins to
     cry along with her.  A sign by the door: "Onward and Upward."JACK (V.O.)If I didn't say anything, people
                 assumed the worst.  They cried
                 harder.  I cried harder.INT. PUBLIC BUILDING CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHTEveryone, including Jack, sits back in their seats, EYES
     CLOSED.  The Leader speaks into a microphone.LEADERTonight, we're going to open the
                 green door -- the heart chakra...JACK (V.O.)I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host
                 to cancer or parasites; I was the
                 warm little center that the life of
                 this world crowded around.LEADER...And you open the door and you
                 step inside.  We're inside our
                 hearts.  Now, imaging your pain as a
                 white ball of healing light.  That's
                 right, the pain itself is a ball of
                 healing light.

     Jack, eyes closed, is silent...LEADERIt moves over your body, healing you.
                 Keep this going and step forward,
                 through the back door of the room.
                 Where does it lead?  To your cave.
                 Step forward into your cave.INT. CAVE - JACK'S IMAGINATIONJack walks along, moving through an ICE CAVERN...LEADER'S VOICEThat's right.  You're going deeper
                 into your cave.  And you're going to
                 find your power animal...

     Jack comes upon a PENGUIN.  The penguin looks at him, cocks
     his head to signal Jack forward.PENGUINSlide.

     The penguin jumps onto a patch of ICE and slides away.EXT. STREET - NIGHTJack walks out a doorway, saying goodbye to people.  He
     walks down the sidewalk, shining with peace.JACK (V.O.)Every evening I died and every
                 evening I was born again.  Resurrected.CUT BACK TO:INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - RESUMINGJack's still in an embrace with Bob.JACK (V.O.)Bob loved me because he thought my
                 testicles were removed too.  Being
                 there, my face against his tits,
                 ready to cry -- this was my vacation.

     MARLA SINGER enters.  She has short matte black hair and
     big, dark eyes like a character from japanese animation.JACK (V.O.)And, she ruined everything.

     Marla looks around, raises a cigarette to her lips.MARLAThis is cancer, right?

     Bob and Jack stare, dumbfounded.INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - LATEREveryone paired-off.  MOVE THROUGH ROOM... FIND JACK'S FACE
     as he stares... MOVE THROUGH ROOM... FIND MARLA'S FACE.
     She's drinking coffee, smoking a cigarette.JACK (V.O.)This ... chick ... Marla Singer ...
                 did not have testicular cancer.  She
                 was a liar.INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHTMarla sits with the group, smoking, listening intently while
     a member speaks.  Jack spies on her.JACK (V.O.)She had no diseases at all.  I had
                 seen her at my melanoma Monday night
                 group ...INT. CATHOLIC CATHEDRAL - NIGHTMarla sits at the end of a row, smoking.  All the faces down
     the row are turned toward her, incredulous...JACK (V.O.)... and at "Free and Clear," my blood
                 parasites group Thursdays.

     Jack leans out further than the others, scornful.JACK (V.O.)-- And, again, at "Seize The Day," my
                 tuberculosis Friday night.CUT BACK TO:INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - ANOTHER NIGHTJack watches... Marla's eyes are closed, her head on the
     shoulder of the MAN she's embraced by.  She opens her eyes,
     catching Jack's stare.  Jack looks away.JACK (V.O.)Marla -- the big tourist.  Her lie
                 reflected my lie.

     Marla rests her chin on the man's shoulder.  Tears roll down
     her cheeks.  She wipes at them.EXT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH - NIGHTMarla walks out,  The support group's dispersing.  Jack
     exits amongst them.  He spots Marla walking away.JACK (V.O.)And suddenly, I felt nothing.  I
                 couldn't cry.  So, once again, I
                 could not sleep.

     Jack stares after Marla for a long moment.  He walks away.INT. BEDROOM - LATERJack, in underwear, is cross-legged on the floor, assembling
     IKEA furniture, CORDLESS PHONE shouldered to his ear.JACK(into phone)
                 No, I just can't believe that card is
                 declined -- Okay, okay, let me give
                 you a different card number.

     Jack gets his wallet off the floor, pulls out another card
     and, MOS over the following, he reads it into the phone.JACK (V.O.)Next group, after guided meditation,
                 after we open our chakras, when it's
                 time to hug, I'm going to grab that
                 little bitch, Marla Singer, pin her
                 arms against her sides and say...INT. MEETING ROOM - NIGHT - JACK'S IMAGINATIONCLOSE ON JACK as he CLAMPS his arms around Marla.JACKMarla, you liar, you big tourist.  I
                 need this.  Get out.INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHTJack, in pajamas, stares at Home Shopping Network on his TV.JACK (V.O.)When you have insomnia, you're never
                 really asleep and you're never really
                 awake.  I hadn't slept in four days...INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHTJack walks in and joins the crowd, looking around.  People
     are chattering with each other.JACK (V.O.)-- But, in here, in everyone, there's
                 the squint of a five-day headache.
                 Yet they forced themselves to be
                 positive.  They never said
                 "parasite;" they said "agent."  They
                 always talked about getting better.LEADEROkay, everyone.

     Everyone sits in chairs.  Jack catches sight of Marla.LEADERTo open tonight's communion, Chloe
                 would like to say a few words.

     Taking the lectern is CHLOE, a pale, sickly girl whose skin
     stretches yellowish and tight over her bones.  She wears a
     head bondage.  She clears her throat.JACK (V.O.)Ahh, Chloe.  Chloe looked the way
                 Joni Mitchell's skeleton would look
                 if you made it smile and walk around
                 a party being extra nice to everyone.CHLOEWell, I'm still here -- but I don't
                 know for how long.  That's as much
                 certainty as anyone can give me.  but
                 I've got some good news -- I no
                 longer have any fear of death.

     APPLAUSE from around the room.CHLOEBut... I am in a pretty lonely place.
                 No one will have sex with me.  I'm so
                 close to the end and all I want is to
                 get laid for the last time.  I have
                 pornographic movies in my apartment,
                 and lubricants and amyl nitrate ...

     The LEADER gingerly takes control of the microphone.LEADERThank you, Chloe.  Everyone, let's

     Jack's face, eyes closed, is motionless.JACK (V.O.)If I did have a tumor, I'd name it
                 Marla.  Marla...the little scratch on
                 the roof of your mouth that would

                 sometimes worked as a projectionist.
                 A movie doesn't come in one big reel,
                 it's on a few.  In old theaters, two
                 projectors are used, so someone has
                 to change projectors at the exact
                 second when one reel ends and
                 another reel begins.  Sometimes you
                 can see two dots on screen in the

     Tyler steps back.  A short guy, RICKY, and a GOATEED MAN
     take off shirts and shoes and step to the center.JACK (V.O.)This kid, Ricky -- supply clerk --

                 into gyms, trying to look like what

     turns -- starts reining PUNCHES into the Opponent's GROIN...CUT TO:Jack lands a couple of BLOWS to HIS OPPONENT'S stomach --
     brings up a left uppercut that smashes the Opponent's jaw.
     Tiny spatters of BLOOD adorn the walls, along with sweat.

     Jack catches sight of a swollen-faced Tyler, watching
     appreciatively, a smile growing slowly on his face.JACK (V.O.)Fight club wasn't about winning or
                 losing.  It wasn't about words.

     The Opponent recovers, throws a headlock on Jack.  Jack
     snakes his arm into a counter headlock.  They wrestle like
     wild animals.  The crowd CHEERS maniacally.JACK (V.O.)They hysterical shouting was in
                 tongues, like at a Pentecostal church.

     Onlookers kneel to stay with the fight, cheering LOUDER.

                 solved, but nothing mattered.

     Everyone moves in as the Opponent steps away.  Tyler pushes
     through the crowd.  Others lift Jack up.  They turn their
     attention to the floor, to a BLOOD MASK of Jack's face --
     similar to the TEAR MASK on BOB'S SHIRT.TYLERCool.

     Tyler gains his breath, determined.  He looks up, turns his
     head, looking to Jack.  Jack watches, wide-eyed.

     Tyler straightens, facing Lou.TYLERNo, I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

     Lou PUNCHES Tyler in the face.  Some of the guys move
     forward, but the Thug points his gun.  Jack-runs forward
     anyway -- Lou PUNCHES him in the face.

     More guys move forward, but Tyler waves them off, facing Lou.TYLERWe really need to use this place.

     Lou proceeds to beat the shit out of Tyler, PUNCHING his
     face, his stomach.  Tyler collapses to the floor.  Lou
     starts KICKING his.  Tyler bleeds from the mouth and face.TYLERThat's it.... that's good.  Get it
                 all out.  You'll feel better.

     Lou flushes red with exasperation, KICKS more.  Finally,
     sweating, bewildered, Lou stops.  He looks to the Thug, who
     is just as bewildered.

     Suddenly, Tyler SPRINGS UP, grabs onto Lou...TYLERYes, I am shit and crazy, to you and
                 this whole fucking world...

     Tyler's blood spatters on Lou.  Lou tries to shake Tyler
     off, but Tyler BITES Lou's NECKTIE.  The Thug grabs Tyler
     and pulls, the necktie tightening and strangling Lou.  Lou
     slaps at Tyler's face, but recoils from the blood.  Tyler
     spits and shouts through clenched teeth...TYLERYou don't know where I've been.

     Tyler bear hugs Lou, pulls him to the floor.  Tyler rubs his
     bloody face into Lou's face.  The Thug lifts Tyler.  Tyler
     clings to Lou's belt, dragging Lou as he is dragged...TYLERWe need this place.  We need it.

     Tyler lets go of Lou's belt.  Lou scrambles away.  The Thug
     drops Tyler, trying to keep clear of the blood.  Lou gets to
     his feet, looks at Tyler, then at the rest of the guys.  He
     and the Thug back away... slamming the door behind.

     Fight club surrounds Tyler.  They help him up, move him to
     a crate.  Tyler sits slumped for a long moment, his
     breathing labored... then, he sits back, crossing his legs
     and looking to the group, his demeanor businesslike.TYLERThis week, each of you has a homework

                 believe that for a minute.

     Marla gets up.  Jack grabs for her, but she's gone, heading
     for the door.  Jack gathers his files, runs to follow...EXT. DINER - MOMESTS LATERJack pushes out the door, files under one arm, catching up...JACKI can't explain.  You wouldn't
                 believe me anyway.  I'm trying to
                 protect you...

     Jack grabs her arm, tries to hail a TAXI, but the taxi races
     past.  Marla pulls free, screaming at him...,MARLALet go of me!JACKDo this for me, Marla.  Do this for
                 me, if you never do anything else...

     Marla looks at Jack, numb.MARLATyler...JACKI'm begging you.  Get on the bus.
                 Get on the bus.

     Marla takes the money from Tyler, walks towards the bus.  As
     they approach it, Jack shields his eyes, afraid to look...MARLAWhy are you doing this?JACKI can't let myself see where you're
                 going.  Go wherever it takes you,

     Marla stands at the doors of the bus, heartbroken, gives one
     last look at Jack.MARLA(holds up the money)
                 I'm not paying this back.  I consider
                 it "asshole tax."JACKYes, fine.  Just, get on.  Stay away
                 a couple of weeks, at least.

     Jack's still covering his eyes.  Marla gets on the bus.MARLATyler...

     Jack finally looks to her.MARLAYou are the worst thing that ever
                 happened to me.

     DOORS HISS SHUT.  The BUS LEAVES, heading away.  Jack seems
     relieved.  Then, a SCREAM is HEARD from MARLA...

     Jack turns, looks... THROUGH THE BUS WINDOWS: the bus is
     filled with BALD MEN IN BLACK: Space Monkeys.

     Jack SPRINTS after the bus...

     The bus speeds away.  Onboard, Space Monkeys subdue Marla.

     Jack falls to the asphalt, rolls, files-flying.JACKSon of a bitch!INT. POLICE STATION - DAYJack RUNS to the front desk, crazed, dumps the armload of

                 five other major cities.  They're
                 tightly-regimented, with many cells

                 central leader.  Check this address:
                 1537 Paper Street.  You'll find the
                 body of Robert Paulson buried in the
                 garden.  You'll also find numerous
                 tubs used to make gallons of
                 nitroglycerin.  The plan, I believe,
                 is to blow up these credit card
                 headquarters and the TRW building.STERNWhy these buildings?JACKYou are not your job.  You are not

     Stern leaves.  A beat, then, the remaining Detectives smile
     at Jack with REVERENCE.FLAT-TOP DETECTIVEI really admire what you're doing.
                 You're a brave man to order this.JACKWhat?REDHEAD DETECTIVEYou're a genius, sir.

     They grab Jack and force him on his back on the table.
     Flat-Top has a rubber band; the Bald Detective has a knife.BALD DETECTIVEYou know the drill.  You said if
                 anyone ever tries to interfere with
                 Project Mayhem, even you, we got to
                 get his balls.

     Flat-Top PULLS Jack's pants completely off, tosses them
     aside.  Jack SCREAMS.  Flat-Top holds his legs.FLAT-TOPIt's useless to fight.REDHEADThis is really a powerful gesture,

     A KNOCK at the door.  Flat-Top slaps a hand over Jack's
     mouth.  He and Redhead block view of the table as Baldy
     opens the door a crack.  Stern mutters:STERNSome of this info checks out.  Let's
                 go to the place on Paper Street.

     Baldy glances back at the other Detectives, leaves, closing
     the door.  The two remaining Detectives continue.  Jack kicks
     and screams and writhes.  The Detectives wrangle him, but
     with more difficulty, now that Baldy's gone.REDHEAD(checking his watch)
                 Mr. Durden, you're going to fuck up
                 the time!

     Jack gets one leg free, KICKS, knocks Flat-top backwards --
     Flat-Top SLAMS the wall, falls.  Redhead lets go of one of
     Jack's arms, jams his elbow into Jack's throat... cutting
     off the airway.  Jack's face reddens... he's choking...

     Jack's free hand reaches, searching.. pulls Redhead's GUN
     and points it at him.  Redhead backs off. Jack gets up,
     gasping for air, PISTOL-WHIPS Flat-top as he rises.

     Jack grabs one of the files off the table.EXT. POLICE STATION - DAYJack, without pants, in BOXER SHORTS, escapes out the BACK
     DOOR.  He looks at the ADDRESS on the file folder.EXT. STREETJack SPRINTS down the middle of the street, gun in hand,

     Jack falls to his knees, doubled over, holding his package.

     across the garage, NINE LARGE CANISTERS, heavily-WIRED.

     Jack runs to the BOMB, frantic.  He walks around it.
     There's a DIGITAL CLOCK, ticking down from "10:05"...

                 still be people inside.

     Tyler keeps walking around, crosses his arms.TYLERMaybe.  Maybe a couple of guys with
                 shaved heads couldn't synchronize
                 their watches.  Good riddance.

     Jack looks back to the BOMB, goes to it, wipes sweat off his
     face.  He starts finger the MANY WIRES, sorting them.TYLERI wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you
                 know which wires, in what order...JACKIf you know, I know.

     Jack holds his gun under one armpit, uses both hands to go
     through the tangle of colored wires.TYLEROr... maybe I knew you'd know, so I
                 spent the whole day thinking about
                 the wrong ones.

     Jack chooses one wire, GREEN, holds it in his fingers.JACKIf I'm wrong, we're both dead..TYLERThis is not about martyrdom.

     Jack twists the GREEN WIRE around his finger.JACKI'm pulling the green wire.TYLERGreen?  Did you say green?

     Tyler comes a little closer, leaning to try to get a look,
     seems genuinely concerned.JACKYes...TYLERDon't pull the green wire.  Pull
                 anything but the green wire.JACKFuck you.TYLERI'm serious.  That's the wrong one.

     Jack's unsure, swallowing, pulling the wire taunt, fingers
     trembling.  The SOUND of a VEHICLE is HEARD from below...TYLERHear that?  Marla's here.  Just in
                 the nick of time, eh?

     Jack looks to Tyler.  Tyler points towards the SOUND...TYLERSee for yourself.

     Jack releases the wire, walks to a RAILING, gun in hand,
     keeps an eye on Tyler.  Jack looks over the railing...

     BELOW, a BUS idles.  The doors open and MARLA'S dragged out,
     kicking and screaming, carried by SIX SPACE MONKEYS...MARLAYou motherfuckers...

     They carry Marla into the BUILDING'S ENTRANCE.

     Jack leans against the railing, exhausted.TYLERI've got everything.  The bombs.  The
                 army.  I've got Marla.JACKBob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew
                 a hole in his head.  Was that part of

     Tyler thinks, shrugs.TYLERBob was a grown man.  In any great
                 struggle, there will be casualties.

                 Seven minutes.  Let's get out of here.

     points the gun at Tyler...JACKTyler...TYLER(still walking away)

     Tyler strides towards the BOMB.  Jack trains the gun...JACKPlease.

     Tyler looks at the BOMB, reaches over to it.  He grips the
     GREEN WIRE, yanks it out -- the CLOCK STOPS.

     Jack lowers his gun.TYLERI did that for you.  As a gesture.
                 Now, how fast can you run?  There are
                 ten other bombs, in ten other
                 buildings in the immediate area.  If
                 you're going to get them all, you
                 better get cracking.

     Jack, heading for the STAIRS.

     Jack aims the gun at Tyler's back, FIRES!

     Tyler ducks to one side, impossibly quick, avoiding...

     CRUSHED under his own foot.JACKOh... Christ...

     Jack holds his head, walks around, at his wit's end.JACKWhy... why... why... ?TYLERWhy what?JACKWhy can't I get rid of you?  Why
                 can't I just wish you away?TYLERYou need me.JACKNo, no, I don't.
                       (pause)
                 I thank you, I really do.  Thank you,
                 but I don't need you anymore.TYLERLook, I can be selfish, I know that.
                       (pause)
                 I'm not blind to my own failings...JACKNoooo, please...

     Jack backs up against a window, numb and weary.TYLERFrom now on, we'll share Marla.
                 We've been spending too much time
                 apart...JACK... no, no, no...TYLERNo more running off without you.
                 From here on out, we do it together.JACKWhy are you doing this?!TYLERI'm doing this for us.JACKPlease understand... I've gotten all
                 I can from this, Tyler.TYLER(sullen)
                 If I leave, you will be right back
                 where I found you...JACKI swear on my life, I won't...TYLERYou will.  You know you will.

     Jack stares at Tyler, tears welling up, hangs his head.  He
     looks at the gun in his hand...TYLERCan you live with that?

     Jack stares at the gun a long time... then...

     Jack brings the gun up, PUTS THE GUN IN HIS MOUTH.

     Tyler cocks his head.TYLERWhat are you doing?JACKWhat have you left for me?TYLERWhy do you want to do that? Why do
                 you want to put that gun in your
                 mouth?JACKNot my mouth.  Our mouth.

     Tyler is calm.TYLERThis is interesting.

     Tyler smiles in appreciation, slowly walks forward, stands
     very close to Jack.TYLERWhy are you going with this, Ikea-
                 boy?JACKIt's the only way to get rid of you...

     Jack COCKS the hammer on the gun.TYLERI can see you feel very strongly.  I
                 feel strongly too.
                       (pause)
                 Hey, you and me.
                       (pause)
                 Friends again?

     Their eyes are locked, unblinking.  Long silence.JACKDo something for me.TYLERWhat?JACKAppreciate something.TYLERWhat?JACKLook at me...TYLERWhat?JACKMy eyes are open.EXTREME SLOW MOTION:Jack's finger squeezes the trigger...

     KABLAM! -- Jack's cheeks INFLATE with gas.  His eyes bulge.
     BLOOD flies out from his head.  The WINDOW behind him
     SHATTERS.  SMOKE wafts out of his mouth and tear ducts.

     RESUME NORMAL SPEED as the GLASS FALLS behind Jack...

     Tyler stands, in gunsmoke, eyes glazed, sniffs the air...TYLERWhat's that smell... ?

     Jack slumps to the floor... Tyler falls...

     Tyler hits the ground.  The back of TYLER'S HEAD is BLOWN
     OPEN, revealing blood, skull and brain.

     Suddenly, a GROUP of SPACE MONKEYS burst into the room,
     moving forward to Jack.  TYLER'S BODY IS GONE.TALL SPACE MONKEYAre you all right, sir... ?!

     Jack quakes, holding the side of his head; a ragged hole
     blown in his CHEEK.  He's bleeding hard, but he's alive.JACKI'm okay...

     Jack looks to the Space Monkeys, trying to get his eyes to
     see.  TWO SPACE MONKEYS enter with Marla.  One holds a gun
     to Marla as she struggles.SHORT SPACE MONKEYAre you sure?  You look terrible,
                 sir!  What's happened?JACKEverything's fine.ANOTHER SPACE MONKEYSir, you look really awful!  Do you
                 need medical assistance?

     Jack sees Marla, tries to get to his feet, falls...JACKBring the girl to me.  The rest of
                 you get out.  Now!

     The Monkeys bring Marla, releasing her, saluting.MARLAWhat happened... ?JACKDon't ask.

     Marla crouches, takes out wadded TISSUES and tries to apply.
     them to Jack's wound.  Space Monkeys are leaving, hesitantly.JACKGet to the rendezvous point.  Move it!

     Jack and Marla are left alone.MARLAMy God, you're shot...JACKYes.

     Jack tries to got up.  Marla helps him.MARLAWho did this to you?JACKI did, I think.  But, I'm okay... I'm
                 fine...

     MASSIVE EXPLOSION... the glass walls rattle...

     Jack and Marla look -- OUT THE WINDOWS: a BUILDING EXPLODES;
     collapsing upon itself.  Then, ANOTHER BUILDING IMPLODES
     into a massive cloud of dust.  Jack and Marla are
     silhouetted against the SKYLINE.  Jack looks to Marla,
     reaches to take her hand.JACKI'm sorry... you met me at a very
                 strange time in my life.

     Marla looks at him.  ANOTHER BUILDING IMPLODES and COLLAPSES
     inward... and ANOTHER BUILDING... and ANOTHER...

     The FILM SLOWS, then ADVANCES ONE FRAME at a TIME -- SHOWING
     SPROCKET HOLES on the SIDES.  EACH FRAME is an IMPLODING
     BUILDING -- then, ONE FRAME IS A PENIS.  Then, the IMPLODING
     BUILDING again.  SPEED UP the frames, LOSE the sprocket
