	MONTAGE of fast moving clips.  Death, destruction, fear.  All images 
	taken from the previous ten Friday The 13ths.AGAIN, DARKNESS.OPEN ON:The year is 2455. The place is Old Earth. Barren, void of life, a 
	hazardous and violent planet. The sky is blood red with spiked clouds of 
	dark gray.  It is beautiful, but frighteningly foreign.

	BLUE LIGHTNING CRACKLES as several figures rush through a DUST STORM 
	below. 

	Small groups of people, wearing thick dusters, goggles and masks, work 
	nearby. Some dig in the cracked earth, others take assorted readings 
	with strange devices.

	This is an archeological expedition.CUT TO:INT.  DARK PLACEThe dust storm rages outside. Two figures are looking closely at a small 
	object buried in the dirt. One of them pulls a device out of their pouch 
	and slowly, gently picks up the object. The other uses a magnetic tool 
	to remove the dirt.FEMALE VOICECareful . . .MALE VOICEI know.

	They take off their masks and goggles. They are both young. ADRIENNE 
	female (17) watches as STONEY male (18) studies the object closely.STONEY(reading)
		Not guaranteed, if used After 2198.

	CLOSE UP of the object. It's an unopened condom.ADRIENNE(smiles)
		You thinking what I'm thinking?

	Stoney tosses the high tech equipment over his shoulder and rips open 
	the condom as Adrienne rips her clothes off.PULL BACK TO REVEALThey are in a half buried mini-van.  It rocks violently from the raging 
	storm outside and from the raging lust inside.BACK INSIDE THE VAN.ADRIENNE(breathless)
		What about Kkinsa?

	STONEY is desperately trying to take off her bra.STONEYIt's over between us. You're the
		only one for me!METAL SCREECHES! THE FLOOR COLLAPSES!They fall some ten feet, RUBBLE RAINING down on top of them.INT.  DARK CORRIDORA rusty metal ladder. Debris everywhere. Half inch layers of dust cover 
	everything. Dead. Lifeless.STONEYYou okay?

	Adrienne sits up, shines her light down the long metal corridor. She 
	turns her light on STONEY then sees something over his shoulder.SHE SCREAMS A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM.We PULL BACK, out of the tunnel, through the van as the sounds of the 
	storm drown out ADRIENNE'S SCREAM.CUT TO:EXT.  BASE CAMPThe digging and readings have stopped. A group approaches a time scarred 
	shuttle and begin loading their packs into the cargo belly.

	FAT LOU (40), rail thin, possible female, pilot, appears at the top of 
	the shuttle ramp.FAT LOU(yelling over the wind)
		Let's go! Time to load up!

	YLLO(33), a professor of archaeology lowers his veil.YLLO(yelling)
		I'm missing two!FAT LOUShit! Temp's dropping! We should have

		North three clicks.CUT TO:EXT. MINI-VAN - DAYYLLO and the rest of the group run into view. BOEMAN (18), husky, 
	physical; holds out a device and checks the reading.

	He points to the rusted out mini-van sitting on its belly.BOEMAN(yelling)
		There!

	KICKER(30), bulky, short on temper, rushes up wearing futuristic 
	military garb -KICKERYo, Teach, what the fuck?YLLOWe're missing two of the kids!KICKERGet your ass back to the shuttle.
		I'll check it out.

	KICKER moves past the group and into the Van.YLLONot without me!

	The rest of the gang look at each other and climb into the Van.INT. ANCIENT CORRIDORYLLO and the others climb down a rusted ladder. Metallic walls, 
	graffiti, cluttered floors. No Stoney or Adrienne. A sign from the 
	ceiling states -CRYSTAL LAKE RESEARCH FACILITY.They all take off the goggles and masks. The rest of the group consists 
	of DELONGPRE(18) good looking, smart ass; JANESSA(17) sexual, scheming 
	AZRAEL(17) SMALL, COCKY; KKINSA(16), insecure, problematic; 
	THORGAN(17), a nerd but doesn't know it.YLLOAmazing! But, how . . I've been coming
		here for ten years. We never picked this up on
		our . . . KAY-EM?

	KAY-EM 14, a cybernetics science droid, removes her veil. She's 
	gorgeous, but there's something off about her look. Something synthetic.KAY-EM 14The air's laced with type two ozone,
		it reads as a solid.THORGANSomebody wanted the place to stay hidden.KAY-EM 14In twenty-eighty-two many of the survivors moved
		their facilities underground to escape . . .KICKERAll right, all right, enough with the history
		lesson. Lets find these two quick . . so I can kick
		some little punk ass.

	Kkinsa shines a flashlight around the dark tunnel.KKINSAI have an idea, why don't you go find
		them and we'll get the hell out of here!

	KKINSA turns and finds herself face to face with - -

	A CORPSE! Easily two-hundred years old it hangs from the wall, impaled 
	through the forehead by an iron spike.KKINSA SCREAMS!Kicker yanks a weapon from his back, locks and loads as 

	JANESSA falls back and lands in the lap of another corpse. She screams! 

	KAY-EM 14 SCREAMS at the top of her lungs. Everyone looks at the droid.KAY-EM 14Was that out loud?DELONGPREEThorgan, have you been screwing with . . .

	THORGAN grabs the head off the CORPSE, with the spike through it's head.THORGANCool! This is an automatic "A".

	Azrael dumps the contents of his bag on the ground, an old boot, some 
	cds, and an ancient box of PLAYTEX . . . starts shoving the corpse into 
	his pack.AZRAELI've got my project. What are you losers
		gonna do?KICKERBack to the shuttle! All of you!
		I'll find them.YLLORelax, Soldier boy, this is amazing.
		These remains are two hundred years old.

	Yllo's light hits a sign hanging from the ceiling. DANGER. STAY OUT.BOEMANCreepy.THORGANCool.KKINSAOkay, I'm outta here.YYLOKay-Em, any thoughts?KAY-EM 14Girth is better than length and
		women prefer a shaved scrotum during
		oral sex.

	Yllo glares a Thorgan.THORGANI'm trying to give her some personality.YLLOWell stop messing with her. I don't want
		a science droid with a personality. Now
		let's find them and get back. I want to
		get clearance to stay back and study this . . .KKINSANo way! I'm not staying here any longer . . .
		I have a life you know.

	A radio crackles.FAT LOU(V.O.)Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze!
		Get your ass back hre!YLLO(into radio)
		Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it.
		You won't believe what we found.
			(calls out)
		Adrienne! Stoney!

	Yllo rushes past the corpse. The others reluctantly follow. They pass 
	another hanging sign - Danger - THEY PASS ANOTHER CORPSE LYING ON THE 
	FLOOR, it's torso separated from it's legs. And this is just the 
	beginning. As they move down the corridor there are bodies everywhere.BOEMANThere was a hall of a battle down here.

	S they move further they break a laser beam . . . sparks fly. A WARNING 
	VOICE sounds.COMPUTER VOICEDan-danger. Do not enter-er.

	But the group keeps moving.KKINSAI feel compelled to ask why we are
		ignoring that.

	A corpse lies on the floor before them, it's skeletal hand beneath a 
	warning written in ancient blood . . .HELP ME . . .Suddenly another CORPSE LEAPS at them, screaming like a banshee! 
	Everyone SCREAMS - It lands on Kkinsa, who totally freaks trying to get 
	the corpse off her. 

	DELONGPREE and YLLO help Kkinsa fight the rotting corpse. They hear 
	hysterical laughter and look up to see -

	ADRIENNE and STONEY . . . emerge from the shadows laughing 
	uncontrollably.DELONGPREEDamnit!YLLOWhat the hell are you two doing?!

	Kkinsa eyes Adrienne, then glares at Stoney.KKINSAYou're toast, mister.YLLOYou're both toast!ADRIENNEYou gotta see this!

	They turn down the right corridor, passing beneath ceiling consisting of 
	a jumbled mess of jagged metal.THORGAN(re: ceiling)
		That's a strange design, don't you think?KICKERWe don't have time for this shit.

	As they pass we see a section of the jagged metal ceiling twitch and 
	squeeze together. That can't be a good thing . . .

	STONEY and Adrienne stop at a huge metal door. Above the door . . .CRYOGENICS LAB.Adrienne points to a small window in the door.DELONGPREEYeah, so? I had Cryo 101 last year.ADRIENNECheck it out.

	With a smirk, Adrienne wipes the condensation from the small window in 
	the door. Drawn from the inside, in blood, is a final warning -A SKULL AND CROSSBONESKKINSASo don't open the door.ADRIENNELook beyond it, yesterday's news.

	Yllo pushes his way to the window.

	Shocked faces.

	INSIDE the blue tinted room we see a huge domed Cryo cylinder. It's 
	massive, but our attention is pulled to the corner of the room. Curled 
	up into a ball, is a body - female, young.YLLOIs that?KAY-EM 14The room's still operational.
		She's perfectly preserved.

	Yllo's face lights up, grabs his radio.YLLO(into radio)
		Fat Lou, bring the ship to the
		following coordinates. Call Grendel,
		have them power up the labs, we're bringing
		in the find of the century!KICKERNow wait a minute! I don't think you
		should open that door.YLLOThis is a science excursion corporal.
		Just stay out of the way.

	Yllo turns to the kids. He's very excited.YLLOOkay, no screwing around. This is the real
		thing. Do exactly what I say. Okay Thorgan, 
		open it up.

	Thorgan pops the cover from a control panel and hooks up a small gadget.KKINSAYou're opening the door?
		What about the . . . ?

	She points to the skull and crossbones.DELONGPREEI'm thinking we should call in some
		experts.YLLOThis is your find people. You want to
		give your credit away?DELONGPREEI was just saying . . .THORGANThe cryo unit leaked. The computers
		sealed the room. No airborne viruses
		no hazardous materials. I've shut down the
		until. Alright, stand back.KAY-EM 14Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses
		will render you unconcious.DELONGPREEKnock you on your ass pal. 

	They don their face masks as  . . . Fshhhhhshshsh. The metallic door 
	cracks open causing a powerful backdraft. The freezing cold air mixes 
	with the air outside the chamber creating a strange gray gas. Ice 
	crystals crack and fall to the floor.EXT.  CRYO CELLYLLOKay-Em!

	Kay moves into the room ahead of the others.INT.  CRYO CELLCLOSE ON KAY-EM'S EYESThey are not human. Mechanical, digital, but alluring. They dilate, open 
	up. Colored lasers shoot forth, slicing through the gas, scanning the 
	body.

	--which itself is slumped over. An icicle of frozen blood from, the 
	wound in her shoulder, props the body up.

	The other enter the icy chamber.DELONGPREEI speak on behalf of the group
		when I say . . . that's fucked.KAY-EM 14Female, nineteen years old, eight months . . .

	Janessa removes a Metallic cube from her backpack, clicks a button and a 
	flat stretcher expands and hovers a few feet off the ground.

	Kicker grabs Yllo.KICKERWe're outta here!

	Yllo pulls away, leans over the frozen girl, grabs the frozen string of 
	blood and -CRACK-breaks it off.YLLOFine, grab that end.


	Kicker sighs and helps Yllo lift the frozen girl and place her curled 
	body on the stretcher.ANOTHER ANGLEAs thorgan stands at the massive Cryo-Unit -THORGANHey check this out!

	Protruding from the door is the tip of a machete.THORGANThis caused the leak and there's an
		occupant. 

	Thorgan yanks the door open.KICKERDon't touch that!

	Gas rolls out. Suddenly ALARMS SOUND and LIGHTS STROBE.KKINSAThis is bad, no?THORGANRelax, it's only a  glitch in the
		system.JANESSAFirst field trip and you think
		you're a Scientist. Move out of the
		way geek. 

	JANESSA moves to look inside the chamber. 

	As the gas and steam clear - we hear the sound of CRACKING ICE, see a 
	jagged mass of frozen crystals . . . and within it . . . a body. A chunk 
	of ice CRACKS and falls tot he floor then THE MASK of JASON VOORHEES 
	looms forward!

	JANESSA screams as JASON'S BODY, stiff as a board, CRASHES to the ground 
	sending ice shrapnel everywhere!DELONGPREEJesus, used to make the suckers big
		didn't they?

	Again, Kay-Em's eyes scan the frozen body.KAY-EM 14Subject was dead prior to incubation.

	Yllo moves to get a good look at Jason.YLLOMy God, look at him. Why would they freeze
		a dead body?
			(a beat)
		Alright, load him up, and let's get out
		of here!OVER HIS SHOULDER - HALLA pair of three foot metallic spiders drop on thin wires to the floor.BACK INSIDEOne of Boeman's gadgets starts to BEEP.BOEMANEr, guy? I'm picking up some movement.

	FZZZZT . . . Azrael screams as a laser slices into the room. His left 
	arm falls to the ground!

	Kay-Em rushes to him. Her finger pops open. A needle appears. She 
	injects him. The drugs take immediate effect.AZRAELCool . . . check out my arm.CLINK - CLINK, CLINK, CLINK, CLINK.HALLThe metallic spiders, lasers attached to their bodies, CLANK towards our 
	heroes.YLLOKicker!KICKERDefense droids. I'm on it.

	Kicker slams the Cryo door shut as lasers slice into it.KKINSAThere goes prom night.

	Kicker clicks at a gadget attached to his forearm.KICKERThey're only class two. I can
		handle this. No problem.AZRAELNot a problem?!

	Kay-Em injects him again.AZRAELI'm missing a fucking arm heeeerrrr-
			(re:shot)
		Oh, that's dreamy.

	The lasers begin strategically slicing through hinges.JANESSAOkay rent-a-cop, do your shit.
		I gotta date tonight.KICKERStand back!

	He pulls a gadget from his pack, punches in a series of buttons.YLLOWe have to get these two back in one piece!

	Kay-Em turns to the frozen girl.KAY-EM 14Subject is critical. Needs nano stabilization
		immediately.YLLOKicker! Do something!ADRIENNEOh Gawd! I wish it would stop doing that.

	At her feet, Azrael's arm twitches spastically.AZRAEL(drugged up)
				That is soooo cool!

	Kicker cracks the door and tosses his gadget.KAFOOM!KICKERCome on!

	Kicker throws open the door and starts BLASTING! Yllo and the kids 
	follow him into the hall, the two stretches in tow. They disappear 
	around the bend - towards the exit.

	A beat then . . . screaming. They run back into view. Behind them - -CLINK, CLINK, CLINK, CLINK, CLINK.A dozen laser wielding spiders make chase! Some are old and rusty, other 
	slump over and short out, but those that work . . . work well.INT.  LONG CORIDOORKicker is running backwards, BLASTING with his weapon. Lasers FLASHING

	A laser strikes the body of Jason Voorhees, breaking off a chunk of ice.THORGAN(reading from device)
		They're not after us. Their sensors are
		locked in on . . . him!

	Thorgan points to JASON'S STRETCHER.KICKERLeave him behind!YLLONo! He's coming with us!

	They round a corner . . .BOEMANHere. We're one meter from the surface!KICKERThen duck.

	CHA-CHUNK . . he cocks his grenade launcher and fires at the ceiling.

	KABLOOM!! Rocks and falling debris reveal the violent surface above.DELONGPREEIt's too high!

	Kicker rolls around the corner and starts blasting!KICKERMake it happen!JANESSAThey're just subclass B droids.
		I'm so not impressed.BOEMANStoney, you catch.

	Stonet leaps, grabs the lip and tosses his feet up and over in a very 
	acrobatic move.

	Boeman kneels, cups his hands to make a step. He begins tossing his 
	friends up to Stoney as Kicker makes war in the hall!

	Soon, Boeman and Kicker are the only two left.BOEMANWe're clear! Let's go!

	Boeman leaps up, grabs the lip and pulls himself to safety. 
	He spins around and holds his arm out for Kicker.

	Kicker leaps, grabs Boeman's hand. Boeman strains to pull him up as 
	spider's cover the floor below them, then -

	A spider crawls up Kicker's leg - a spike shoots out into Kicker's 
	thigh. He screams.KICKERThey've got me! Let go!BOEMANNo!

	Boeman ROARS and pulls harder. Kicker's pack RIPS from his body - the 
	spiders falling with the pack.EXT. SURFACE - DAYThe sand storm is raging on the surface. Kicker lands on top of Boeman.BOEMANThat wasn't so bad.

	Kicker bites the pin from a grenade, tosses it into the hole.KICKER(yells)

	The others dive for the ground as -  - 

	KAFOOM! A FIREBALL rises up out of the hole!THORGANNice touch.BOEMANAnd you said high school was boring.

	Our team fights the winds and rushes up the ramp of the waiting shuttle.

	FAT LOU is waiting at the ramp. He looks at the two stretchers.FAT LOUOh my God . . . what the hell is . . .YLLOJust get us to the ship!

	Azrael stops in a panic!AZRAELOh shit I forgot my arm!ADRIENNEHere. Dumbass.

	She hands him the severed limb as they race up the ramp.

	As the group gather their equipment and begin to move the two 
	stretchers, Brodski stepsi n front of YLLO.BRODSKIWhat the hell were you thinking?

	YLLO ignores him, turns to his team.YLLOGet them in the lab!BRODSKINot so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.

		Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you

		I have a medical emergency to deal with.

	Reluctantly, Brodski steps aside. As the kids follow, Azrael bumps into 
	DALLAS, one of the E-X GRUNTS. Azrael glares at him, brandishing the 
	severed limb.AZRAELWatch it punk, I'm armed.DALLASPunk?

	the others.DELONGPRE(V.O.)Nooooooo!!RIZZOgrapples with Jason, but JASON IS JUST TOO STRONG.

	Jason holds HER with his good hand and REARS his metallic hand back. 
	He's
	going to punch a hole right through her helmet, most likely throat her 
	head,
	when --WHAM!Delongpre rockets into Jason, but Jason's got one of his arms
	sticking through one of Rizzo's harnesses. THe three go tumbling.

	Delongpre clings to Jason's back.DELONGPRE(V.O.)Rizzo, pull away!RIZZO(V.O.)I'm stuck!

	RIZZO is fighting to untangle her harness. We can hear
	Delongpre CHOKING over the radio.

	The three are spinning even closer and closer towards EARTH II.

	Then, Rizzo reaches down. She grabs Delongpre's leg and CLICKS a button 
	on her sleeve.KA-CHSSHSH!!!HER AIR TANK BLOWS!JASON IS THROWN OFF OF THEM!But he's still tangled in Rizzo's hoses. And now she has no air.

	Jason turns...grabs the hoses and begins pulling himself
	toward Rizzo and Delongpre.

	He has them...when --WHAM!BRODSKIStill barely alive barrels into Jason, vlinging to his back.
	He turns, slashes with his knife and severs the hoses.

	Suddenly Boeman and Thorgan grab them.  The four survivors huddle 
	together.KAY-EM 14Hello? A little assistance here?

	Slowly they begin entering the atmosphere.

	Immediately Brodski is engulfed in flames and is gone. He was a good
	man...stay to the end to make sure the job was done right.

	Spread eagle and alone, facing the planet below, Jason continues his
	descent.

	His fingers wiggle as his chrome mask begins to heat up.
	It begins to glow. His metallic arm and leg glow.
