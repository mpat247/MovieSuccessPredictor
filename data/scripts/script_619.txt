               of Bedford Falls, somewhere in New York State. The streets 
               are deserted, and snow is falling. It is Christmas Eve. Over 
               the above scenes we hear voices praying:GOWER'S VOICEI owe everything to George Bailey. 
                         Help him, dear Father.MARTINI'S VOICEJoseph, Jesus and Mary. Help my friend 
                         Mr. Bailey.MRS. BAILEY'S VOICEHelp my son George tonight.BERT'S VOICEHe never thinks about himself, God; 
                         that's why he's in trouble.ERNIE'S VOICEGeorge is a good guy. Give him a

               CAMERA PULLS UP from the Bailey home and travels up through 
               the sky until it is above the falling snow and moving slowly 
               toward a firmament full of stars. As the camera stops we 
               hear the following heavenly voices talking, and as each voice 
               is heard, one of the stars twinkles brightly:FRANKLIN'S VOICEHello, Joseph, trouble?JOSEPH'S VOICELooks like we'll have to send someone 
                         down � a lot of people are asking

                         crucial night. You're right, we'll 
                         have to send someone down immediately.

                         Clarence.

               A small star flies in from left of screen and stops. It 
               twinkles as Clarence speaks:CLARENCE'S VOICEYou sent for me, sir?FRANKLIN'S VOICEYes, Clarence. A man down on earth

               The stars fade out from the screen, and a light, 
               indistinguishable blur is seen.CLARENCE'S VOICEWhere? I don't see a thing.JOSEPH'S VOICEOh, I forgot. You haven't got your 
                         wings yet. Now look, I'll help you

                         something?

               The blur on the screen slowly begins to take form. We see a 
               group of young boys on top of a snow-covered hill.CLARENCE'S VOICEWhy, yes. This is amazing.JOSEPH'S VOICEIf you ever get your wings, you'll

               large shovels. One of them makes the slide and shoots out 
               onto the ice of a frozen river at the bottom of the hill.BOY(as he slides)

               Series of shots as four or five boys make the slide down the 
               hill and out onto the ice. As each boy comes down the others 
               applaud.CLOSE SHOTGeorge Bailey at bottom of slide.GEORGE(through megaphone)

               the other boys, and his shovel takes him onto the thin ice 
               at the bend of the river. The ice breaks, and Harry disappears 
               into the water.CLOSE SHOT � GEORGEGEORGEI'm coming, Harry.MEDIUM SHOTGeorge jumps into the water and grabs Harry. As he starts to 
               pull him out he yells:GEORGEMake a chain, gang! A chain!WIDER ANGLEThe other boys lie flat on the ice, forming a human chain. 
               When George reaches the edge with Harry in his arms, they 
               pull them both to safety.JOSEPH'S VOICEGeorge saved his brother's life that 
                         day.  But he caught a bad cold which 
                         infected his left ear. Cost him his 
                         hearing in that ear. It was weeks 
                         before he could return to his after-

               whistling.  Their attention is drawn to an elaborate

                         and meanest man in the county.

               The boys continue until they reach Gower's drugstore. The 
               drugstore is old-fashioned and dignified, with jars of colored 
               water in the windows and little else. As the kids stop:GEORGESo long!BOYS(ad lib)

               on the counter. He shuts his eyes and makes a wish:GEORGEWish I had a million dollars.

               a small girl, is seated, watching him. George goes on to get 
               his apron from behind the fountain.GEORGE(calling toward back

               at the fountain. She is the same height as Mary and the same 
               age, but she is infinitely older in her approach to people.VIOLET(with warm friendliness)

               He pulls a magazine from his pocket and shows it to her.MARYA new magazine! I never saw it before.GEORGEOf course you never. Only us explorers 
                         can get it. I've been nominated for

                         Society.

               He leans down to finish scooping out the ice cream, his deaf 
               ear toward her.  She leans over, speaking softly.CLOSE SHOTMary, whispering.MARYIs this the ear you can't hear on? 
                         George Bailey, I'll love you till

               She draws back quickly and looks down, terrified at what she 
               has said.CLOSE SHOT � GEORGE AND MARYGEORGEI'm going out exploring some day,

                         four wives.  Wait and see.

               He turns back to the cash register, whistling.ANOTHER ANGLETaking in entrance to prescription room at end of fountain. 
               Gower comes to the entrance. He is bleary-eyed, unshaven, 
               chewing an old unlit cigar. His manner is gruff and mean. It 
               is evident he has been drinking.GOWERGeorge! George!GEORGEYes, sir.GOWERYou're not paid to be a canary.GEORGENo, sir.

               He turns back to the cash register when he notices an open 
               telegram on the shelf. He is about to toss it aside when he 
               starts to read it.INSERT: THE TELEGRAMIt reads: "We regret to inform you that your son, Robert, 
               died very suddenly this morning of influenza stop. Everything 
               possible was done for his comfort stop. We await instructions 
               from you.  EDWARD MELLINGTON Pres. HAMMERTON COLLEGE."BACK TO SHOTGeorge puts the telegram down. A goodness of heart expresses 
               itself in a desire to do something for Gower. He gives the 
               ice cream to Mary without comment and sidles back toward 
               Gower.INT. PRESCRIPTION ROOM OF DRUGSTORE � DAYCLOSE SHOTGower, drunk, is intent on putting some capsules into a box.GEORGEMr. Gower, do you want something...  
                         Anything?GOWERNo.GEORGEAnything I can do back here?GOWERNo.

               George looks curiously at Gower, realizing that he is quite 
               drunk.  Gower fumbles and drops some of the capsules to the 
               floor.CLOSE SHOTCapsules spilling on floor at their feet.BACK TO SHOTGeorge and Gower.GEORGEI'll get them, sir.

               He picks up the capsules and puts them in the box. Gower 
               waves George aside, takes his old wet cigar, shoves it in 
               his mouth and sits in an old Morris chair in the background. 
               George turns a bottle around from which Gower has taken the 
               powder for the capsules. Its label reads "POISON." George 
               stands still, horrified.GOWERTake these capsules over to Mrs. 
                         Blaine's.  She's waiting for them.

               George picks up the capsule box, not knowing what to do or 
               say.  His eyes go, harassed, to the bottle labeled poison. 
               George's fingers fumble.GEORGEYes, sir. They have the diphtheria 
                         there, haven't they, sir?GOWERUmmmm...

               Gower stares moodily ahead, sucking his cigar. George turns

               street. Mary follows him with her eyes.EXT. STREET � DAYMEDIUM SHOTGeorge runs down the street until he comes opposite a two-
               story building with a sign on it reading: "Bailey Building 
               and Loan Association." He stops. Potter's carriage is waiting 
               at the entrance. Suddenly he runs up the stairs.INT. OUTER OFFICE BLDG. AND LOAN � DAYFULL SHOTThe offices are ancient and a bit on the rickety side. There 
               is a counter with a grill, something like a bank. Before a 
               door marked:

               "PETER BAILEY, PRIVATE", George's Uncle Billy stands, 
               obviously trying to hear what is going on inside. He is a 
               very good-humored man of about fifty, in shirt-sleeves. With 
               him at the door, also listening, are Cousin Tilly Bailey, a 
               waspish-looking woman, who is the telephone operator, and 
               Cousin Eustace Bailey, the clerk.  The office vibrates with 
               an aura of crisis as George enters and proceeds directly 
               toward his father's office.CLOSE SHOTUncle Billy listening at the door. As George is about to 
               enter his father's office, uncle Billy grabs him by the arm.UNCLE BILLYAvast, there, Captain Cook! Where

                         him yesterday. Switch it inside.

               He enters a door marked: "WILLIAM BAILEY, PRIVATE". George 
               stands irresolute a moment, aware of crisis in the affairs 
               of the Bailey Building and Loan Association, but aware more 
               keenly of his personal crisis. He opens the door of his 
               father's office and enters.INT. BAILEY'S PRIVATE OFFICE � DAYMEDIUM SHOTGeorge's father is seated behind his desk, nervously drawing 
               swirls on a pad. He looks tired and worried. He is a gentle 
               man in his forties, an idealist, stubborn only for other 
               people's rights.  Nearby, in a throne-like wheelchair, behind 
               which stands the goon who furnishes the motive power, sits 
               Henry F. Potter, his squarish derby hat on his head. The 
               following dialogue is fast and heated, as though the argument 
               had been in process for some time.BAILEYI'm not crying, Mr. Potter.POTTERWell, you're begging, and that's a

                         they even ought to think of a decent

               George takes off his hat and coat, moves over to the dresser

               While the above thoughts are passing through George's head, 
               his attention is caught by a picture on the wall near the 
               dresser:INSERT: PICTURE ON THE WALLIt is the sketch of George lassoing the moon that we first

               underwear.  He is sipping a mug of hot coffee, staring at 
               the stove, cold, gloomy and drunk, ignoring Clarence and the 
               tollkeeper, preoccupied by his near suicide and his unsolved 
               problems.  Clarence is standing on the other side of the 
               stove, putting on his undershirt. This is a ludicrous

               each time is stopped by some amazing thing Clarence does or

               The tollkeeper, about to spit, is stopped in the middle of 
               it by this remark. Clarence, secretly trying to get George's 
               attention, now picks up a copy of "Tom Sawyer" which is

               He leans forward to spit, but is stopped by Clarence's next

               two legs.  Tollkeeper rises and makes his way warily out the
