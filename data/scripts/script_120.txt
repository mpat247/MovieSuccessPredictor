                                      Shooting Draft2000FADE IN:EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- SEPTEMBER AFTERNOONA COUPLE moves down a walkway, deep in subdued conversation. 
               All around them trees explode with autumn color. Birds sing. 
               Their path is dappled with leafy shadow.

               To their left, on the sunny meadow, TEENAGERS throw saucers 
               and footballs, smoke cigarettes and joints, drink beer and 
               soda, savoring the waning hours of summer.CLOSER ON THE COUPLEHe is WILLS KEANE, late 40's to early 50's, strikingly 
               handsome, impeccably dressed, and supremely poised. At first 
               glance he has the proud glow of a hedonist who in the war 
               against time has been the undisputed victor.

               Only a closer look hints at the toll of battle. His shoulders 
               strain under the weight of so much repetition. His eyes are 
               touched by regret. The lines in his face reveal an emerging 
               disenchantment not so much with the world as with himself.

               Walking at his side is a WOMAN, 30, attractive and bright. 
               Her name is unimportant because so many have come before her 
               and, if the past prevails, so many will come after.

               She listens intently, as Wills finishes speaking --WILLS-- and I could have waited to tell 
                         you, but I wanted to leave no room 
                         for misunderstanding.WOMANWell, you certainly didn't.EXT. ANOTHER CENTRAL PARK WALKWAY -- LATERStill talking quietly, they pass into a more secluded area 
               of the park--WOMANNo, I see how you could feel this 
                         way. Of course I do. It's human. But 
                         what I don't get is why you'd want 
                         to announce it so quickly. I mean, 
                         we just met. Feelings change. You 
                         don't even know me.WILLSYes, I do.

               She is amused by his confidence --WOMANOh, really?WILLSThe minute I laid eyes on you. It's 
                         the saddest thing about getting older. 
                         You know people so quickly. I even 
                         knew you'd end up hating me.WOMANWell, you're wrong. I don't.WILLS(with a weary smile)
                         Give it time.

               She laughs. Then he stops. He hears something. She stops. 
               She hears it, too. It's a GIRL'S VOICE. He casually turns 
               and looks, squinting into the sun.

               He takes a few steps and there, between trees, he sees TWO 
               DOZEN PEOPLE sitting on the grass and on folding chairs -- 
               most are middle-aged or older with a distinctly intellectual-
               bohemian look to them.

               Standing and addressing them is CHARLOTTE FIELDING, 19, fair, 
               willowy, pale, lovely in an unconventional way. She wears an 
               eccentric hat and a vintage dress. Her bearing is upright, 
               her gaze warm and intelligent, her voice rich with emotion --CHARLOTTE-- and for weeks I sat by her bed 
                         and cried. I told her I loved her 
                         and I begged her not to leave me. 
                         All I could think about was what I'd 
                         lose if she died. And then one 
                         night... she was in really bad pain... 
                         I stopped thinking about myself for 
                         a second and I thought about her.
                              (fighting tears)
                         I stopped crying. I said goodbye. 
                         And in less than an hour Ella was 
                         gone.

               The woman whispers in Wills' ear --WOMANIt's so sad.

               But Wills ignores her. He watches Charlotte with keen 
               interest, touched by the depth and sincerity of her emotion.CHARLOTTEI really think it's possible to hold 
                         a person back... cry them back... 
                         from dying. That's what I did to 
                         Ella and I'll never do it to anyone 
                         else again.
                              (softly)
                         I hope no one ever does it to me.

               She looks out at the group, many of whom are crying. A tear 
               runs down her cheek. She smiles and wipes it away.

               The woman, seeing Wills' interest in the girl, whispers --WOMANSo what do you know about her?

               He knows a great deal. Or at least he thinks he does. But 
               his answer is nonchalant --WILLSThat she's just a kid.

               He takes the woman gently by the elbow and guides her away. 
               He steals one last look back.

               Charlotte, returning to where she was sitting, notices Wills. 
               Their eyes meet and a charge passes between them.

               Meanwhile an OLD MAN has risen from his chair --OLD MANI met Ella at City College in 1938...

               Wills slowly turns and walks away.MUSIC AND TITLES IN:EXT. MANHATTAN SUBWAY STOP -- AUTUMN DUSKA SWARM OF PEDESTRIANS ascends the steps to the bustling 
               street.

               BOXES and SHOPPING BAGS, carrying an antique, wood-and-wireDRESSMAKER'S MANNEQUIN.She wears a peasant dress with a cycle jacket, a backpack, 
               and another eccentric hat.EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK -- DUSKCharlotte makes her way down the leaf-strewn pathway. Wheeling 
               the mannequin by the neck, she passes NYU STUDENTS smoking,

               offers her assistance, but she politely and firmly refuses.EXT. WEST VILLAGE STREET -- DUSKCharlotte wearily hauls the mannequin across the cobblestone 
               street, over the curb, and up to the stoop of a charming but 
               slightly dilapidated BROWNSTONE.INT. BROWNSTONE FOYER -- DUSKCharlotte opens the door into the darkness. She hits a light 
               switch and nothing happens. She flips it back and forth --CHARLOTTEShit.

               She dumps her boxes and bags, then wheels in the mannequin.CHARLOTTEDolly! The bulb burned out!MUSIC AND TITLES OUT:INT. BROWNSTONE LIVING ROOM -- SAMEEIGHT SILHOUETTES are crouched in the dark room. The mantel 
               is draped with a HAPPY BIRTHDAY BANNER. The coffee table is 
               stacked with WRAPPED GIFTS.INT. FOYER -- SAMECharlotte looks suspiciously at the living room door --CHARLOTTEDolly?

               She tiptoes through the darkness and lays her ear against 
               it.INT. LIVING ROOM -- SAMEWe hear chuckles and whispers of anticipation. An older 
               woman's raspy, boozy voice growls --RASPY VOICEMy ass hurts.

               A few people chuckle, but they're quickly hushed. The DOOR 
               KNOB TURNS and the DOOR OPENS. Everyone leaps up in a blaze 
               of light --ALLSURPRISE!The MANNEQUIN bursts into the room, teetering crazily, wearing 
               CHARLOTTE'S JACKET, BACKPACK, and HAT.

               Everyone FLINCHES and SCREAMS. Amid a chorus of laughter, 
               Charlotte enters. Grinning, she wags a facetious finger --CHARLOTTESee? Surprises suck!INT. WILLS' BEDROOM -- NIGHTAn antique clock ticks crisply on the dresser. Wills stands 
               before a mahogany mirror, buttoning a freshly laundered white 
               shirt.

               Lying on the cradle bed, half-wrapped in a sheet, naked but 
               for a string of pearls, is TANYA, 35, raven-haired, much too 
               thin. She smokes a cigarette.TANYAOh, Wills, please, not again. It's 
                         our third date and we're already in 
                         a rut.WILLSBut I thought you loved it.

               She stretches with her cigarette but before she can make it 
               to the ashtray, her ASH FALLS on a New York magazine.

               On the cover is a PHOTOGRAPH OF WILLS standing next to a 
               YOUNG CHEF in a fashionable restaurant. The caption reads: 
               "The Prodigal Son Returns."TANYAOh, I do -- except for the fact that 
                         there isn't a single thing on the 
                         menu I can eat.WILLS(with a chuckle)
                         Sure, there is; there's just very 
                         little you're willing to digest.

               He slips in a cuff link. She affects a breezy indifference --TANYAFine then. We'll go, I'll get big, 
                         fat, and horrible, and it'll serve 
                         you right.

               Wills slips on a silk tie --WILLSNo, it won't. Because it takes at 
                         least a few weeks to get fat and by 
                         then you won't even be speaking to 
                         me.TANYA(curiously)
                         Why do you say that?

               He stops tying his tie and stares at her in the mirror --WILLSBecause we have no future. All I can 
                         offer you is this... what we have 
                         right now... nothing more 
                         meaningful... until it ends.

               He goes back to tying his tie, then adds softly --WILLSI could have waited to tell you, but 
                         I wanted to leave no room for 
                         misunderstanding.

               She stares at him, speechless.INT. RESTAURANT -- THAT NIGHTIts decor is exquisitely tasteful, its ambiance warm and 
               convivial. The night is in full swing. Most of the tables 
               are taken and the bar is packed.EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE -- SAMEFrom amid the RUSH OF TRAFFIC, a TAXI breaks free and glides 
               to the curb in front of the RESTAURANT.

               Its facade is windowless. Only a small brass plaque on the 
               grey marble reveals that this is ELYSIUM.

               Wills and ERIKO, 30's, Japanese, aloof and stunning, emerge 
               from the taxi, elegantly dressed, and move to the front door.INT. ELYSIUM -- CONTINUOUSTWO TIPSY DEBUTANTES pass Wills and Eriko as they enter. One 
               recognizes Wills and smiles flirtatiously.

               Wills stops and helps Eriko off with her jacket. JESUS, 30, 
               the dashing Cuban-American maitre d', superbly discreet, 
               approaches --JESUSGood evening, Mr. Keane. Will you be 
                         dining with us tonight?WILLSWe certainly will. Table seven, Jesus, 
                         if it's available.JESUSYes, sir.

               Wills hands Eriko's jacket to MELISSA, 20, the hat check 
               girl --WILLSHow are you, Melissa?MELISSA(blushing)
                         Fine, Mr. Keane.

               CELIA, mid-20's, the chipper, blonde Midwestern hostess, 
               arrives, wearing a stunned, glassy smile.WILLSGood evening, Celia. And how --CELIA(with forced cheeriness)
                         Just dandy, sir, thanks!JESUSTable seven.CELIAThis way, please.

               Celia, barely making eye contact with Eriko, walks quickly 
               away. Wills is amused and a little confused by Celia's 
               behavior. He lays a hand on Eriko's back --WILLSI'll be right with you.

               Eriko nods and follows Celia.

               Wills moves to the reservation stand where his best friend 
               and the restaurant's manager, JOHN VOLPE, 40, a brilliant, 
               dapper, tough as nails Brooklynite stands, listening to 
               someone on the telephone.

               Wills lays a hand on his shoulder and mutters into his ear --WILLSHow's it going?JOHN(covering the phone)

                         Waltzin' in here like you own the 
                         joint.

               Wills laughs and takes a look into the bar. John gestures 
               with his head in Eriko's direction --JOHNSo who's the new potential ex-wife? 
                         I thought you were still wastin' 
                         time with Tanya-von-What's-her-name.WILLSWe wisely agreed to cut our losses.

               Wills exits into the bar. John smiles and shakes his head.

               FOLLOW WILLS, as he glides along the bar. CUSTOMERS and STAFF 
               greet him warmly.

               As he enters the main dining room, DINERS spot him -- 
               sprinkled among them are CELEBRITIES from every walk of city 
               life. Wills greets them, stopping to shake their hands and 
               kiss their cheeks.

               Suddenly, Celia, the hostess, red-faced, blocks his path --CELIALook, I have no right to say this, 
                         okay? And you can fire me if you 
                         want, but in the six weeks we've 
                         been open you've brought in six 
                         different women -- tonight makes 
                         seven -- and it's really starting to 
                         get to me.WILLSIn what way?CELIAI have to greet them! It's like 
                         working at a dog shelter! I'm afraid 
                         to learn their names or even smile 
                         at them because I know any minute 
                         they could be put down!WILLSI assure you it's an absolutely 
                         painless procedure.

               Shocked, she can't help but sputter a laugh --CELIAIt is?WILLSSure.
                              (beat)
                         Especially for me.

               They both laugh. He moves closer, lowers his voice, and speaks 
               with warm sincerity --WILLSActually, I appreciate your concern, 
                         Celia. The truth is I'm a little 
                         worried myself.CELIASeriously?WILLSSeriously. I've been trying to do 
                         better.
                              (uneasily)
                         But... you know how it is... old 
                         habits die hard.CELIASo I'm not fired?WILLSNope. In fact, John's been looking 
                         for an assistant. Tell him you've 
                         just been promoted.

               Wills smiles, pats her in the shoulder, and moves on. She 
               can't believe it.

               A WAITER carrying a BIRTHDAY CAKE -- blazing with candles 
               and decorated with a WOMAN'S HAT made of MERINGUE LATTICEWORK -- 
               passes by on his way to the REAR DINING ROOM.

               From inside, VOICES begin to sing HAPPY BIRTHDAY. Wills, his 
               curiosity piqued, follows.INT. REAR DINING ROOM -- CONTINUOUSThe waiter sets down the cake at the center of a round table. 
               There's a CHEER and APPLAUSE as the song ends. Wills cannot 
               see whose birthday it is because the waiter blocks his view.

               Just as Wills is about to exit the room, the waiter steps 
               away. Wills glances over and sees the birthday girl. At first 
               he can't place her, but then he does, and his face softens 
               and brightens.

               It's Charlotte. She wears a black velvet dress and a 
               wonderfully eccentric hat. Her eyes glow in the candlelight. 
               Through the chorus of voices, urging her to make a wish, she 
               cries out --CHARLOTTEYou guys! Let me think!
                              (concentrating)
                         Okay. Okay.

               Charlotte blows hard, and, with a little more effort than 
               you might expect, extinguishes the candles. Everyone APPLAUDS 
               and CHEERS.

               To Charlotte's right sits SIMON LORING, late 20's, English, 
               sardonic, adoring. He gestures at her CHEST and says --SIMONWatch carefully, everyone -- they 
                         ought to begin emerging any moment 
                         now.

               Everyone laughs. Charlotte playfully slaps him --CHARLOTTEVery funny! Actually, any moment now 
                         you're gonna turn straight and fall 
                         at my feet.SIMONOh, darling, you know I would if I 
                         could.

               Charlotte's best friend, SHANNON HARRIS, 19, a spoiled but 
               big-hearted redhead, drowning in curls, mutters --SHANNONThe only time he falls at your feet 
                         now is when he wants to borrow your 
                         Prada loafers.

               More laughter.

               BACK TO WILLS. He considers approaching Charlotte, but then 
               he looks back and sees Eriko sitting alone at their table, 
               idly stabbing at her drink with a straw.

               Regretting his rudeness, he takes a step toward her, but 
               then hears --WOMAN'S VOICEIs that Wills Keane?

               He turns and sees DOLORES TALBOT, 70, blonde wig, spindly 
               frame, weathered skin, large, sad eyes. She holds a mixed 
               drink --WOMANIt sure as hell is and he hasn't 
                         changed a bit!WILLSI'm sorry, do I --WOMANYou little fool, it's Dolores Talbot. 
                         Dolly!

               His smile shows uneasy surprise --WILLSMy God, it is.DOLLYYeah, I know, time's kicked my ass 
                         but good. Come on, Romeo, let's bury 
                         the hatchet. Give me a hug. Careful 
                         of the cocktail.

               As he hugs Dolores, he can't help but look over at Charlotte 
               again.DOLLYSo what the hell're you doin' around 
                         here? Last I heard you were out in

                         fortune.WILLSActually, I doubled it.DOLLYGood for you!

               ON CHARLOTTE. She looks over. Her view is such that she sees 
               Wills but not Dolores.

               A faint blush creeps into Charlotte's cheeks. She pretends 
               to listen as Shannon tells a story --SHANNON-- and you know how bouncer's get. 
                         He's like, "That's the worst fake 
                         I.D. I've ever seen." And I'm like, 
                         "Yeah? Well, you have the worst dread-
                         extensions!" And then just when --

               Noticing Charlotte's distraction, Simon whispers calmly to 
               her --SIMONAre you feeling all right? You look 
                         positively green.

               Charlotte speaks under her breath without moving her lips --CHARLOTTEHe's here. And he's staring at me 
                         again.SHANNONNo way!

               Both Shannon and Simon turn to look, but like lightning 
               Charlotte grabs them both --CHARLOTTEDon't!
                              (to Simon)
                         Wait a few seconds, then go to the

                         on your hands.

               Charlotte watches furtively as Simon rises from his chair 
               and walks over. As he passes Wills, he flashes him a seductive 
               smile. Wills is confused by it.CHARLOTTEOkay, look.

               Shannon swivels her head and throws an aloof, vacant stare 
               in Wills' direction. Then she looks back at Charlotte, mouth 
               agape --SHANNONHe's as old as my dad!

               Charlotte laughs.

               BACK ON WILLS. He does his best to be attentive as Dolores 
               exhales a plume of smoke into his face --DOLLYSure, L.A.'s okay if you're a cactus 
                         or a lizard, but if you're a New

               ON CHARLOTTE. She sits listening to Shannon --SHANNONAnd so, after all that, we pay our 
                         cover, we get in, and it's totally 
                         heinous! Nothing but losers and --

               Charlotte looks over and pales, her eyes widening --CHARLOTTEOh, shit.SHANNONWhat?

               Dolores walks up, hauling Wills by the arm --DOLLYKids! I want you to meet an old chum 
                         of mine, the owner of this fine 
                         establishment -- Wills Keane!

               The table greets him. Wills, slightly self-conscious, looks 
               at everyone but Charlotte.DOLLYAnd that over there's the birthday 
                         girl -- my granddaughter, Charlotte.

               The news hits Wills hard. But he does his best to hide it. 
               He musters a casual smile --WILLSNot Katie and Jay's daughter?DOLLYYou bet. She got her height from her 
                         dad. But her talent's all Katie's.

               Dolores indicates the hat that Charlotte's wearing --DOLLYMade it herself from scratch. That 
                         one, too.

                         Honey, show 'im.

               Shannon makes an elaborate comic show of modeling the hat 
               she's wearing. The table laughs.

               Wills levels his gaze at Charlotte --WILLSImpressive.

               Try as she might to accept the compliment with grace, 
               Charlotte can't help but grin.CHARLOTTEThanks.

               The WINE STEWARD stands at a station on which sit TWO BOTTLES 
               OF CHAMPAGNE on ice. He reaches for one. Wills stops him --WILLSI think we can do better than that.

               The steward, understanding, nods and departs, taking the 
               champagne with him.WILLSHappy birthday, Charlotte.CHARLOTTEThanks.SHANNON(under her breath)

               Amused, he flashes Charlotte his most dazzling smile.WILLSI'll let you get back to your 
                         celebration.

               Wills turns to exit. Simon, returning to his seat, murmurs 
               seductively to Wills as he passes by --SIMONLeaving so soon?

               Wills looks at him, confused again, then continues on. As 
               Simon sits, he mutters to Charlotte --SIMONBe still my beating heart.

               OLIVIA, 30's, Wills' Jamaican cook and housekeeper, enters. 
               Plump, handsome, and perpetually amused, she carries a tray 
               laden with continental breakfast and a New York Times. Wills 
               mouths a greeting. She smiles back and sets the tray on a 
               table.WILLSI called because I'm going to be

                         size is also the same.CHARLOTTEBut that doesn't necessarily --WILLSIt's a risk we'll just have to take.

               Charlotte runs over to her sewing table, looking for a pen 
               and paper. She finds paper, but no pen --WILLSHer dress is a sheath... sleeveless,

               She clicks off the phone, wilts into a swoon on the bed, and 
               breaks out laughing.

               Wills, still holding the receiver, stares dreamily into the 
               middle distance.

               He snaps to when Olivia enters. Her accent is as much Queens 
               as it is Caribbean --OLIVIASee, now you got me worried.WILLSWhat do you mean?OLIVIAYou slept alone last night. You must

               with yellow from years of cigarettes. In one corner, the 
               paint has chipped off the ceiling in a jagged plate.

               Dolores sits on a worn-out leather arm chair, smoking, sipping 
               a cocktail, watching a DAYTIME TALK SHOW.

               In the background, we see Charlotte working in the ADJOINING 
               DINING ROOM which she has turned into a lovely sewing room.

               CLOSER ON CHARLOTTE. She builds her hat on a HAT BLOCK -- a 
               wooden mannequin head. Strewn all around her are the materials 
               of her hatmaking -- bolts of cloth, hat blocks, a sewing 
               table.

               Shannon, wearing sweats and a T-shirt, lies on the floor, 
               eating M+M's and drinking diet soda, while heavily marking 
               up a text book with a YELLOW HIGHLIGHTER.

               Charlotte stops and rubs her eyes, then she glances down at 
               Shannon and smiles --CHARLOTTEWhy don't you mark what isn't 
                         important? That way you'll save ink.SHANNONWhy don't you sew your mouth to my

               Shannon rolls over onto her back --SHANNONGod, I hate school.

               Charlotte pins a strip of black lace to the hat --CHARLOTTEOh, come on, just last week, you 
                         said you were on a roll. You loved

               Charlotte chuckles and sets the half-finished hat on her 
               head. Still seated, she wheels her work chair over to a mirror --CHARLOTTEI think you're incredibly lucky. I'd 
                         love to be going to college.

               Shannon rolls over and looks at her. Suddenly her expression

               She models the hat. Tears well in Shannon's eyes and she 
               says without even a hint of irony or sentimentality --SHANNONThat you're the most beautiful person

               Charlotte smiles, looks away, and, trying not to cry, fusses 
               with the hat.EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST -- NIGHTA cold autumn rain falls. The Irish doorman, MICHAEL, 60's, 
               melancholy, stoop-shouldered, smokes a cigarette, looking up 
               at the unburdening sky.

               A LIMOUSINE pulls up. The passenger window glides down --DRIVERMikey! How ya doin'?DOORMANA bit early, aren't you?DRIVERHey, in this soup, better safe than

               RUNNING FOOTSTEPS approach. Michael looks. The driver looks, 
               too.

               It's Charlotte, dressed in tattered jeans, a light rain coat, 
               and sneakers, dashing at breakneck speed down the street, 
               carrying something in a GARBAGE BAG.CHARLOTTEKEANE!She runs right past Michael --INT. ELEVATOR -- NIGHTMichael works the shiny brass controls. Charlotte, winded, 
               hair dripping wet, watches the numbers tick by overhead. 
               Michael smiles at her with paternal fondness --MICHAELHe's goin' to a fancy party tonight.

               Charlotte, nonplused by his lack of discretion, smiles 
               politely --CHARLOTTEOh, really?INT. WILLS' PENTHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATERThe elevator doors open.MICHAELWatch your step, Miss.CHARLOTTEThank you.

               She emerges, moves to Wills' door, and waits for the elevator 
               to close. When it does, she hurries back to a table over 
               which hangs a GILDED MIRROR.

               She takes a LOVELY OLD HAT BOX out of the garbage bag and 
               ditches the bag under the table. Then she quickly checks 
               herself in the glass.

               She doesn't like what she sees. She pokes at her sopping 
               hair and squeezes it, but it's hopeless. Remembering the 
               time, she hurries back to the door, takes a deep breath, and 
               rings the bell.

               She waits. And waits. Then she hears footsteps approaching. 
               She realizes she's left the hat box on the table.

               She rushes over and grabs it, just in time to get back to 
               the door when it OPENS.

               Olivia, the housekeeper, steps out, wearing her coat and 
               carrying her purse. Her voice is low and gentle --OLIVIAHe's waitin' for you, Miss Fieldin'.

               They exchange cordial smiles. Charlotte enters.INT. WILLS' APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUSCharlotte steps into a dim hallway lined with oil paintings, 
               carpeted with a Persian runner, and lighted by three antique

               She looks and sees Wills standing, back turned, before a 
               broad set of high windows. City lights glimmer in the 
               distance; beneath them lies the vast gloom of Central Park.CHARLOTTEI couldn't get a cab, so I took the

               Wills turns around. A magnificent figure -- expertly tailored 
               tux, every hair in place, freshly manicured. And then he 
               offers her an amused, reassuring smile --WILLSCharlotte, relax. What's the point 
                         of being a beautiful young woman if 
                         it isn't to keep your admirers 
                         waiting? In fact, you disappoint me: 
                         I was looking forward to at least 
                         another half hour of suspense.

               Flattered, her face brightens --CHARLOTTEI could leave and come back.WILLSNope, too late. Anyway, I want to 
                         see the hat.

               He walks over to her. Smiling, she sets down the box, unties 
               the ribbon, and gingerly removes the hat. It's sublimely 
               simple and elegant. She looks at him with hope. His face 
               betrays nothing --WILLSTry it on.CHARLOTTEI can't. I'm soaked.WILLSIt's all right.

               Charlotte, a little confused, carefully sets the hat on her 
               head. She steps to a wall mirror, pulls the veil down, and 
               sets it at the correct angle.

               Wills appears behind her and shares the reflection. She feels 
               his presence, hears his breathing. They speak in hushed tones --WILLSIt's perfect. It's like a tiny 
                         sculpture.CHARLOTTEI wanted it to be a tiny poem.

               She smiles. Their eyes meet in the glass.WILLSIf only I had some use for it.

               It takes a few beats for Wills to put it together. He smiles, 
               realizing that her presence at Elysium wasn't a coincidence. 
               She smiles back, sweetly, coyly.

               seems entranced by her easy manner of expression --CHARLOTTEI met Ella in the fourth grade. She 
                         was my teacher at the Little Red 
                         School House. We stayed friends after 
                         she retired. She taught me how to

                         The most important thing she did was 
                         introduce me to poetry. She believed 
                         it was the highest form of art and 
                         that everything we say and do should 
                         aspire to it.

               Wills is uncomfortable for a moment, then ventures quietly --WILLSIt sounds as though, in a way, she

                         like if something that tragic could 
                         happen, there was no way she was 
                         ever gonna care about anyone else 
                         ever again. Including herself. She

                         ignored me. She was more like a weird 
                         landlady than a grandmother.

               Charlotte smiles sadly. Her eyes glisten in the light.WILLSI'm sure she did the best she could.CHARLOTTEFor a long time I kinda thought that, 
                         too, and I made excuses for her, but

                         and I needed her and she wasn't there.

               Silence as Wills somberly reflects. Finally, he speaks --WILLSI remember when I heard the news

               Suddenly, a SWING SONG starts. Wills smiles at the ironic

               Holding his hand, she starts moving to the music. Wills laughs --WILLSI have no idea what to do!CHARLOTTEHave fun!

               She flings her wrap onto a chair and keeps dancing. Wills, 
               charmed senseless, finally surrenders.

               A SEQUENCE BEGINS during which we see WILLS and CHARLOTTE 
               having an inordinately good time. Wills maintains a modicum 
               of reserve; Charlotte is joyful and entirely unembarrassed.

               CERTAIN GUESTS NOTICE THEM. The reactions to their pairing 
               runs from confusion to disgust to amusement.

               But no one watches them more carefully than Lisa.

               Finally, in the middle of a song, Wills and Charlotte make 
               their way off the floor, winded and laughing. Wills heads 
               off to the bar. Charlotte turns around and watches the other 
               dancers.

               Then we notice Lisa standing next to her. They smile at each 
               other. Lisa offers her a cocktail napkin. Charlotte takes it 
               and wipes off her brow.

               They speak above the music --LISAI had to come. I work at the Met.

               He hands Charlotte a punch --WILLSWho was that?CHARLOTTELisa something.

               Wills laughs, then opens the bottle as he picks up his

                         you're getting older is that you

                         extremely rare. In Charlotte's case,

               Wills shifts uneasily in his chair.SIBLEYEventually she'll be treated for

                         would be slim. Right now Charlotte's

               He begins to undress. His hands are uncertain as he untucks

               Although we cannot see him in the moonlight and shadows,

               Her face shuts like a trap. She walks toward the bedroom 
               door --CHARLOTTEI won't give people hope when there 
                         isn't any.WILLSWhy not?! Maybe we want hope! Or

               Suddenly, a sob catches in his throat. Charlotte, on her way 
               to the bedroom, stops and slowly turns around.

               She speaks matter-of-factly, without judgment or feeling.CHARLOTTENow I know why you hurt so many women. 
                         Because you always knew if you held 
                         on to one of them, you'd never let 
                         go.

               She turns and exits coldly to the bedroom. Wills sinks into 
               an armchair.INT. WILLS' BEDROOM -- LATERIn grey afternoon shadows, Charlotte lies on her side, fully 
               clothed under the covers, with her eyes open, thinking. She 
               hears something and looks back.

               Wills stands in the lighted doorway.

               She gestures for him to come. He walks over and lies down 
               next to her. She turns her back to him, so that he's spooning 
               her, but she takes hold of his hand, pressing it against her 
               chest and squeezing it like a doll.

               For a long time, they lie in silence. Finally, she murmurs 
               almost inaudibly --CHARLOTTEWhen we met, I was so lonely. But I 
                         didn't even know it. I'd been alone 
                         so long.. almost forever...WILLSSo had I.CHARLOTTEBut now we have each other.

                         Oh, what would I do, Wills? What 
                         would I do if you weren't here? Where 
                         would I be?

               Fighting his emotions, determined to stay strong for her, he 
               holds her close.WILLSYou don't ever have to worry about 
                         that.CHARLOTTEI'll do whatever I have to! I'll

                         leave you!

               The dam breaks and she is wracked by sobs. Wills closes his 
               eyes, holds her even tighter, and rocks her in his arms.DISSOLVE TO:INT. WILLS' BEDROOM -- THAT EVENINGCharlotte, still fully clothed, lies sound asleep. She slowly 
               awakens and sees that Wills is gone. She gets up on one elbow --CHARLOTTEWills?!

               She waits, hears hurried steps, then Wills sticks his head 
               in --WILLSYeah?CHARLOTTEHow long was I asleep?WILLSA couple of hours.CHARLOTTEWow. And I'm still tired.WILLSThat's all right. Relax.

               Charlotte senses something odd in his tone. Her eyes narrow 
               with suspicion.CHARLOTTEWhat're you doing in there?WILLSNothing.

               She laughs and starts to get up --CHARLOTTELiar!WILLSDon't! Don't move! Just one more

               He closes the door.INT. WILLS' LIVING ROOM -- SAMEWills runs back into the room. The tree is fully decorated

               He runs over, inserts the plug and the TREE LIGHTS UP with 
               LITTLE WHITE LIGHTS, but for the STAR AT THE TOP.CHARLOTTE'S VOICEOh no! You didn't!WILLSYou were just going to tire yourself

               He grabs a chair and fiddles with the bulb inside the star.CHARLOTTE'S VOICEThis I've gotta see!WILLSJust hold on!

               THE STAR LIGHTS UP. He jumps down and puts the chair away. 
               Then he runs over and dims the lights --WILLSFinishing touches!

               He runs over and adjusts a garland. He runs back to the dimmer 
               and adjusts it again --WILLSAlmost!

               He runs back to the bedroom door and flings it open.WILLSVoila!

               He looks into the room and freezes in the doorway. He backs 
               up a step, then, crying out, lunges into the room.MUSIC UP:EXT. WILLS' BUILDING -- NIGHTCharlotte, lying unconscious on a stretcher, wearing an oxygen

               Her eyes open then close again. Her breathing is heavy and

               Wills pushes a lock of hair off her brow, then whispers, 
               half to himself --WILLSTime cannot break the bird's wing 
                         from the bird. Bird and wing together

               Charlotte's eyes open dreamily. She shows a faint smile at 
               the poem and murmurs almost inaudibly --CHARLOTTEWhat have I done to you?WILLSRuined me for other women.CHARLOTTENo... I saved you for them...

               The NURSE rushes over to the gurney and in an instant

               Dolores, ignoring the sign, smokes a cigarette.

               John and Celia sit side-by-side in silence.

               Wills stands at the window. He looks over and see Simon 
               standing close by. Simon looks at him, his eyes sad but eerily 
               calm. Wills shakes his head --WILLSIt happened so quickly. We'd just 
                         talked about the surgery. She agreed

               A light enters Wills' eye. He smiles as he remembers --WILLSYou know, it's funny, the first time 
                         I saw her, I --

               But then Wills hears something. He turns and there's Grandy 
               at the end of the long hall, walking toward the waiting room.

               Simon looks and sees him, too.

               Wills looks at Simon with alarm. It's impossible. How could 
               Grandy be finished so soon? Wills looks back at Grandy.SLOW-MOTIONGrandy moves with long strides down the corridor.

               One by one, as they notice, Charlotte's loved ones react to 
               the sight of Grandy.

               Shannon rises from Sarah's lap, looks at the doctor, then 
               covers her face with her fists, holding her breath.

               Dolores crushes out her cigarette, her expression falling.

               Celia touches John's back as he rises and walks over to Wills.

               Simon's face turns to stone.

               John reaches for Wills, but Wills advances a few steps toward 
               the corridor, almost defiantly, his eyes riveted to Grandy.

               Grandy's head is down.

               John stands, also wearing his coat, in the hall archway, 
               unsure whether he should stay or leave.

               Wills looks at the Christmas tree, whose lights still burn. 
               He slowly walks over and pulls the cord from the wall.

               conversation. All around them spring is in full glory. Melted 
               snow. Trees exploding with green. Birds singing.

               The man is Wills Keane, but he has markedly changed. His 
               dress is not so impeccable, his hair has gone grey at the 
               temples. His face, though still beautiful, has gracefully 
               turned the corner into middle age.
