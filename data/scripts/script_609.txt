           kingdom, there lay a small village at
           the edge of the woods...

          Suddenly, the WELL-WORN BOOT of Cinderella steps into the
          frame and lands on what we thought was the sky, but in fact
          is simply its reflection in a puddle of water. A strong CHORD
          accents the splash and we begin a musical vamp.EXT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - DAYBREAKCLOSE-UP on CINDERELLA'S dirty hand as it reaches down to

          The DOOR pops off its frame and goes flying across the room
          in a giant puff of smoke. The BAKER and his WIFE scream and
          cower in a corner.
          As the fog clears, we see the WITCH for the first time and
          she's not a pretty sight. MICE and other vermin drop from

           wish.

           They were a lovely couple. But not
           lovely neighbors. You see, your mother
           was with child and she developed an
           unusual appetite. She admired my
           beautiful garden and she told your

           girl suddenly found herself in a very
           unusual part of the wood.WOLF'S POVBranches and leaves rush by in a blur. Suddenly, the CAMERA
          stops, and in the distance we see LRRH strolling down a path
          of exotic flowers as she munches on a treat. We hear HEAVY
          BREATHING. The CAMERA continues stalking its prey, moving
          closer towards LRRH through the brush.
          ANGLE on LRRH, as she continues walking and eating.WOLF (O.S.)Good day, young lady.
          She turns around and what she sees - through a CHILD'S EYES -
          is a super-slick, good-looking guy. What she doesn't notice
          is his curiously low hairline, something of a snout, and a
          tail peeking from his waistcoat.LRRHGood day, Mr. Wolf.WOLFWhither away so hurriedly?LRRHTo my Grandmother's.WOLFAnd what might be in your basket?LRRHIt's bread for Grandmother so she'll

          silhouetted by the red hot sun. He lets out a mighty howl.EXT. WOODS - FLOWERED PATH - DAY - CONTINUOUSLRRH goes about her business picking flowers further from her
          path.
          ANGLE ON THE BAKER who has been observing LRRH from a
          distance. Like a bat, the WITCH swings upside down from a
          tree above the BAKER:WITCHWhy are you standing there?! Go get
           the cape!BAKERYou frightened me!
          The WITCH swings to the ground.WITCHGet it! Get it! Get it!BAKERHow am I supposed to get it?WITCHYou go up to the little thing, and you
           take it.BAKERI can't just take a cloak from a

           asked you in the first place? I'm not
           allowed to touch any of the objects!
          We suddenly hear the lilting sound of a young voice singing
          in the distance. The WITCH, almost intoxicated by her sound,
          swoons with delight. Then:WITCH (CONT'D)(YELLING)Get me what I need! Get me what I
           need!
          She wraps the cape about herself and disappears in such a
          strong blast of wind that it knocks the BAKER to the ground.BAKERThis is ridiculous!
          ANOTHER ANGLE. LRRH is picking flowers off the path, blithely
          unaware of anything else. The BAKER gets up and hurries over
          to her.BAKER (CONT'D)Hello there little girl.LRRHHello, Mr. Baker.BAKERHave you saved some of those sweets
           for Granny?LRRHI ate all the sweets and half the loaf
           of bread.BAKERSo I see! Now tell me...where did you
           get that beautiful cape?LRRHMy Granny made it for me.BAKERIs that right? I would love a red cape
           like that.LRRH(GIGGLING)You'd look pretty foolish.BAKERMay I take a look at it?
          He quickly unties it.LRRHNo!26He pulls it off her back, she grabs the other side.BAKERI need it badly.LRRHPlease -- give it back!
          They have a tug of war.
          The BAKER pulls free and runs off with the cape. LRRH stands
          there momentarily stunned, then lets out a loud scream.
          ANGLE ON THE BAKER. He stops cold, realizing what he's done,
          then runs back to LRRH and places the cape around her
          shoulders.BAKERI'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure
           that you really loved this cape. Now
           off you go to Granny's -- and be
           careful that no wolf comes your way.LRRHI would rather a wolf than you any

          LRRH stamps on his foot. The BAKER hops on his good foot.BAKER(DISTRAUGHT)This is hopeless. I'll never get that

          She inspects his hand, which holds a few coins and the six
          magic beans.WIFE(loudly, for the
           benefit of the boy)

          He hands JACK the five beans, carefully dropping them one at
          a time into the boy's hand. The WIFE quickly takes the SIXTH
          BEAN and puts it in her pocket.BAKER (CONT'D)Good luck there, young lad.
          As the BAKER takes the cow's leash, JACK wraps his arms
          around the bony animal.JACKOne day, I'll buy you back -- Promise!
          JACK kisses the cow. The BAKER looks to his WIFE guiltily.
          Overcome with emotion, JACK runs back into the woods.BAKERTake the cow and go home!WIFEI was just trying to help.BAKERMagic beans! We've no reason to

          It's difficult to say who is more beautiful, the PRINCE or
          the HORSE. From the corner of his eye he notices something in
          the distance. He slows down and circles back, and HEARS the
          melodious singing of RAPUNZEL. He dismounts and slips through
          the brush to see:EXT. WOODS - RAPUNZEL'S TOWER - DAYR-PRINCE POVAn exquisite tower, surrounded by a thicket of tall rose

          little discomfort for RAPUNZEL.)31BAKER (V.O.)The old enchantress had given the name

          sticking out of it's mouth.
          Squeamishly, he pulls back the sheet to see the WOLF'S

          Suddenly CINDERELLA in her ball-gown rushes out of a back
          entrance and onto the terrace disappearing around a corner.ANOTHER ANGLE - THE STEPSShe descends a long stretch of ancient stone steps that lead
          to the outside grounds.ANOTHER ANGLE - CONTINUOUSShe appears running down a garden path below and into the
          woods. A beat later, CINDERELLA'S PRINCE, dashes out on to a
          drawbridge where he spots CINDERELLA below. He is tall, dark
          and impossibly handsome. His STEWARD and other attendants
          join him.C'S PRINCEI must find that girl!EXT. WOODS - PATHWAY TO THE CASTLE - NIGHTThe BAKER'S WIFE is trying to find her way back to the
          village, pulling an obstinate MILKY-WHITE on a leash behind
          her. We see a piece of the castle in the distance.
          We TRACK CINDERELLA racing through the brush -- not an easy
          feat in a ball gown and gold slippers. We hear VOICES in the
          distance and the NEIGHING OF HORSES. CINDERELLA stumbles on a
          knoll, loses her footing and rolls over and over to the
          bottom landing with a spectacular THUD just yards from theWIFE.WIFEAre you alright, miss?CINDERELLA(STARTLED)Yes. I just need to catch my breath.WIFEWhat a beautiful gown you're wearing.
           Were you at the King's Festival?
          CINDERELLA, preoccupied, collects herself so she can continue
          on her way.CINDERELLAYes.WIFEAren't you the lucky one. Why ever are
           you in the woods at this hour?
          We hear the PRINCE'S ENTOURAGE approaching.37STEWARD (O.S.)This way!CINDERELLAPlease. Don't let them know I'm here.
          She quickly hides herself in the brush. The WIFE turns around
          and looks to the top of the rise to see C-PRINCE on a black
          stallion, with his STEWARD and ATTENDANTS in tow. He calls
          down to the WIFE.C'S PRINCEHave you seen a beautiful young woman
           in a ball gown pass through?WIFE(Breathless as sheBOWS)I don't think so, sir.STEWARD(POINTING)If I may, my lord, I think I see her
           over there.
          The ENTOURAGE races off and CINDERELLA reappears and sits,
          catching her breath.WIFEI've never lied to royalty before.
           I've never anything to royalty before!CINDERELLAThank you.WIFEIf a prince were looking for me, I
           certainly wouldn't hide.CINDERELLAWell, what brings you here -- and with

           woods.(WITH PRIDE)He's undoing a spell.CINDERELLA(IMPRESSED)Oh?WIFEOh, yes. But tell me, the Prince, what

AND--?CINDERELLAAND IT MADE A NICE CHANGE.WIFENO, THE PRINCE!CINDERELLAOH, THE PRINCE...WIFEYES, THE PRINCE.CINDERELLAHE HAS CHARM FOR A PRINCE, I GUESS...WIFEGUESS?CINDERELLAI DON'T MEET A WIDE RANGE.AND IT'S ALL VERY STRANGE.39WIFEBut why would you run away?CINDERELLAIt's not quite what I expected.WIFEPrinces, castles, gowns...CINDERELLAI have no experience with those
           things.
          We hear the far off CHIMES OF MIDNIGHT from the castle.WIFEBut you will return to the Festival
           tomorrow eve?CINDERELLAYes... No... I don't know...WIFEYou don't know? What I wouldn't give
           to be in your shoes.
           (looking to herSHOES)...I mean your slippers.(EXCITED)As pure as gold?CINDERELLAI must get home.
          CINDERELLA runs off.WIFEWait! I need your shoes!
          The WIFE goes after CINDERELLA but then hears a distant COW
          MOAN. She turns around to discover that MILKY-WHITE has taken
          off.WIFE (CONT'D)Milky-White!
          The WITCH appears from nowhere.WITCHOne midnight gone!WIFEAlready?!WITCHGet that cow!
          The WIFE takes off after the cow as the CAMERA RISES above
          tree level. The BLUE SHADOW has moved a little further across
          the face of the MOON.40EXT. JACK'S FARMHOUSE - THE NEXT DAY - DAYBREAKA STRAGGLY ROOSTER crowing, the sun cutting across its path.INT. JACK'S FARMHOUSE - DAYBREAK - CONTINUOUSJACK'S MOTHER is woken by the rooster crow to find something
          ticking her nose.
          She opens her eyes, brushing the "something" away -- then

          With a grand sweep of her cape, the WITCH throws off dirt and
          muck over the BAKER and the BAKER'S WIFE as she disappears
          into a cloud of dust.
          The BAKER wipes dirt from his mouth.BAKERI don't like that woman.WIFEI'm sorry I lost the cow.BAKERI shouldn't have yelled.

          She goes.EXT. WOODS - PINE FOREST - DAYWIDE SHOT. We hear the hoofbeats of horses coming from both
          directions. Crossing the frame and each other are
          CINDERELLA'S PRINCE on his BLACK stallion and RAPUNZEL'S
          PRINCE on his WHITE steed. They pass out of the frame. After
          a few beats, they return trotting, meeting in the middle.R'S PRINCEGood brother. I was wondering where
           you'd gone.45C'S PRINCEI have been looking all night for her.R'S PRINCEHer?C'S PRINCEThe beautiful one I danced the evening

           maiden. She lives here in the woods.C'S PRINCE(INCREDULOUS)The woods?
          In the background we see the WIFE, who has wandered by on her
          way back home. She stops to EAVESDROP on the PRINCES.R'S PRINCEYes! In the top of a tall tower that
           has no door or stairs.C'S PRINCEWhere?R'S PRINCETwo leagues from here, due east, just

           "Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your

           longest, most beautiful head of hair -
           yellow as corn - which I climb.
          The WIFE is thrilled by this news, and runs off.46C'S PRINCERapunzel, Rapunzel! What kind of name

          approaches the tower with trepidation.WIFERapunzel, Rapunzel? Let your hair down
           to me.
          The window at the top of the tower opens and RAPUNZEL sticks
          out her head looking downward. The WIFE hides to the side.RAPUNZEL(DUBIOUS)Is that you at this hour, my Prince?48WIFE(in her best princelyBASS VOICE)Yes.
          RAPUNZEL thinks about it for a moment, then lowers her hair.
          The WIFE approaches it gingerly.WIFE (CONT'D)Excuse me for this.
          She takes a fist full of hair and gives it a pull. Nothing.
          She tries once again, this time with more force eliciting a
          little yelp from RAPUNZEL. Finally, she holds on to the hair
          and just starts running away from the tower as fast as she
          can. We hear RAPUNZEL yell as the WIFE succeeds in pulling
          some of the hair from her head.EXT. PATHWAY TO THE CASTLE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUSCinderella flees the castle.BAKER (V.O.)As the Baker's Wife bolted from the
           tower, the second night of the
           festival was thrown into chaos when
           Cinderella once again ran from the
           Prince.
          While the BAKER'S WIFE continues to run away from Rapunzel's
          tower, in the distance she sees a flutter of gold moving
          through the moonlit trees. CINDERELLA? She changes course in
          pursuit.
          SERIES OF SHOTS with MUSIC
          CLOSE-UP on CINDERELLA'S SHOES as they make their way through
          wooded path.
          ANGLE ON THE WIFE as she races towards them in pursuit.
          The WIFE catches up with CINDERELLA and tackles her to the
          ground, CINDERELLA'S slipper falling off. They both dive for
          the slipper, when an approaching noise catches the WIFE'S
          attention.C'S PRINCE (O.S.)Over here!
          CLOSE-UP on the shoe as CINDERELLA snatches it from the
          ground. CINDERELLA rushes off.
          The WIFE stares frozen in horror as the PRINCE'S HORSE races
          towards her. She lets out a scream and the horse stops short,
          rearing up. The STEWARD'S horse charges off the path into
          thickets.C'S PRINCE (CONT'D)Who is she? Where did she go?49WIFE(BOWING)I have no idea, sir.C'S PRINCEDon't play the fool, woman!WIFEI was trying to hold her here for

          The STEWARD returns, covered in burrs and looking none too
          happy.STEWARDNo sign of her, my liege.C'S PRINCEWell, what are you waiting for? See if
           you can find her.
          The STEWARD rides off. The PRINCE pauses. The ultimate
          seducer, he gives the WIFE the once over.C'S PRINCE (CONT'D)The woods can be a dangerous place...
          She nods to him, out of her depth. He gallops off.EXT. WOODS - TALL TREES - NIGHTThe BAKER searches for MILKY-WHITE along a large PATHWAY,
          disheveled and exhausted.BAKERMoo... Moo......
          He HEARS sounds off in the distance.BAKER'S POVThe STEPFAMILY'S carriage is passing through a large hollowed
          opening in the base of a huge tree.
          We can hear the STEPSISTERS bickering, their blonde hair
          bobbing animatedly.ANOTHER ANGLEThe BAKER stands in the middle of the pathway, flagging down
          the carriage. He pulls an ear of corn from his satchel. As
          the carriage slows, he hops on the sideboard.50BAKER (CONT'D)Please, if you would be so kind, may I
           compare this ear of corn with your
           hair?

           you!STEPMOTHERMongrel!
           (to the driver)
           Carry on!
          She pushes the BAKER off the carriage and he somersaults
          backwards into the brush.
          The CARRIAGE speeds off. Deflated, the BAKER picks himself
          off the path and sits on what he thinks is a white rock.
          There is a muffled "Moo..." He jumps up realizing he's been
          SITTING on the cow.BAKERMilky-White!
          He hears something and hides behind a BUSH. Then, seeing it
          is his WIFE, he steps out.BAKER (CONT'D)I thought you were returning home!
          The WIFE screams in fright. Then she recognizes him.WIFEOh! It's you! And you've the cow!

          MILKY-WHITE has begun to shake like a dashboard ornament. She
          moans, then topples over with a loud thud. Alarmed, JACK runs
          to the cow and lays his head on the animal's chest.JACK (CONT'D)(TEARFUL)Milky-White is dead!
          The BAKER looks up and sees that the SHADOW has now moved a
          third of the way across the MOON. We hear the WITCH scream:WITCH(O.S.)TWO MIDNIGHTS GONE!EXT. RAPUNZEL'S TOWER - DAYBREAKHidden by a broken piece of WALL -- someone or something is
          watching the R-PRINCE climbing out of the window.BAKER (V.O.)When dawn broke, the Baker and his
           Wife had but one day left to reverse
           the Witch's curse. As for Rapunzel's
           Prince, he returned yet again to the
           forbidden tower.54With RAPUNZEL smiling down, the R-PRINCE descends her hair.
          Once he has reached the bottom, she pulls her hair back in
          and closes the window.
          ANOTHER ANGLE. We discover that it's the WITCH who has been
          watching. She is not happy.
          The PRINCE mounts his horse and rides off towards a low rose
          thicket -- an easy jump.
          With a thrust of her stick, the WITCH makes the thicket shoot
          up before the PRINCE has time to act. His HORSE stops short
          and he screams as he is thrown over the horse's head into the
          thicket.
          ANGLE ON THE WITCH. She smiles at her handiwork then turns to
          stare at the top of the tower vindictively.INT. RAPUNZEL'S TOWER - DAYThe WITCH threatens RAPUNZEL.WITCHWHAT DID I CLEARLY SAY?/ CHILDREN MUSTLISTEN.RAPUNZELNo, no, please!WITCHWHAT WERE YOU NOT TO DO?/ CHILDRENMUST SEE--RAPUNZELNo!WITCHAND LEARN./ WHY COULD YOU NOT OBEY?/CHILDREN SHOULD LISTEN./ WHAT HAVE IBEEN TO YOU?/ WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE MEBE,/ HANDSOME LIKE A PRINCE?AH, BUT I AM OLD./ I AM UGLY./ IEMBARRASS YOU.RAPUNZELNo!WITCHYOU ARE ASHAMED OF ME.RAPUNZELNo!WITCHYOU ARE ASHAMED./ YOU DON'TUNDERSTAND.55RAPUNZELI'm no longer a child.

           going, no one will ever see you again.
          The WITCH lunges at RAPUNZEL with a pair of SHEARS and begins
          to hack off her hair. The girl lets out a mighty shriek.EXT. NEAR GRANNY'S HOUSE - ELEPHANT OAKS - DAYJACK makes his way despondently through the oaks with hisGOLDEN EGG.He comes across what looks like a WOLF, hunched over on the
          edge of the brush. He stops... then slowly approaches.JACKHey there - nice cape!
          The figure twists around, pulling a knife.LRRHStay away from my cape or I'll slash
           you into a thousand bits!56The figure is revealed to be LRRH, in a wolf-skin cape,
          picking mushrooms for her granny.JACKWhoa! I don't want it.(BEAT)Where did you get it?LRRHMy Granny made it for me from a wolf
           that attacked us. And she gave me this

          He shows her his GOLDEN EGG.LRRH(SUSPICIOUS)Where did you get that egg?JACK(pointing to the sky)
           I stole a hen that lays golden eggs
           from the kingdom of the Giant.LRRHI don't believe you.JACKIt's true. And you should see the
           Giant's toy harp. It plays the most
           beautiful tunes without your even

           to the kingdom right now and bring it

          He runs off.57EXT. BEANSTALK & JACK'S FARMHOUSE - AFTERNOONTo frantic MUSIC, JACK is making his way down to the bottom
          of the beanstalk with all the speed he can muster. This is
          made more difficult by the GOLDEN HARP which he has slung
          over his shoulder.BAKER (V.O.)Jack took the little girl's dare and
           before he knew it, found himself
           fleeing from a Giant.
          Suddenly, the BEANSTALK shakes mightily, making JACK hold on
          for dear life. He looks up to discover the Giant climbing
          down after him; Jack feverishly picks up speed and jumps the
          last six feet to the ground. He quickly drops the harp and
          runs to a large axe embedded in the stump of a tree.
          JACK swings the AXE striking the BEANSTALK.EXT. WOODS - PINE FOREST - AFTERNOONThe SWING of the AXE is picked up by the BAKER snapping a
          branch that's in his way.

           back here.BAKERRight.(BEAT)Why are we always separating?WIFEBecause we have to if we're going to
           be together...
          The BAKER and his WIFE start to go off in opposite directions
          when there is a TREMENDOUS CRASH with the force of an
          earthquake. The BAKER and his WIFE are knocked off their feet
          and tumble into a bank of FERNS. They scramble to their feet
          and look to one another.WIFE (CONT'D)What is happening?EXT. JACK'S FARMHOUSE - AFTERNOONThe Giant lies still on the ground.BAKER (V.O.)The entire kingdom shook when the
           beanstalk came crashing down, killing
           the Giant...EXT. KING'S CASTLE - PALACE STEPS - NIGHTThe MOON is now half covered by SHADOW. DROP DOWN to find
          CINDERELLA running down the steps; commotion ensues as she is
          followed by the PRINCE and his retinue.BAKER (V.O.)...as for Cinderella, she fled from
           the Prince... again.
          ANOTHER ANGLE. Suddenly, when CINDERELLA is MID-FLIGHT on the
          steps, she falters, unable to move. She looks down to see
          that there is TAR on this step and her shoes are stuck.
          ANGLE ON THE PRINCE. Smiling as he sees he has finally
          trapped his prey.
          We FREEZE the action as CINDERELLA considers the situation.59CINDERELLAHE'S A VERY SMART PRINCE,/ HE'S APRINCE WHO PREPARES./ KNOWING THISTIME I'D RUN FROM HIM,/ HE SPREADPITCH ON THE STAIRS./ AND I'M CAUGHTUNAWARES./ WELL, IT MEANS THAT HECARES--/ THIS IS MORE THAN JUSTMALICE./ BETTER STOP AND TAKE STOCK/WHILE YOU'RE STANDING HERE STUCK/ ONTHE STEPS OF THE PALACE.ALL RIGHT, WHAT DO YOU WANT?/ HAVE TOMAKE A DECISION./ WHY NOT STAY AND BECAUGHT?/ SHOULD I GIVE THAT ATHOUGHT,/ WHAT WOULD BE HIS RESPONSE?/She turns around to see the PRINCE, frozen in time and

          step with no tar. She pulls one shoe from the tar, and as she
          goes to pry the second shoe, she stops.CINDERELLA (CONT'D)WAIT, THOUGH, THINKING IT THROUGH,/THINGS DON'T HAVE TO COLLIDE--/ I KNOWWHAT MY DECISION IS:/ WHICH IS NOT TODECIDE./I'LL JUST LEAVE HIM A CLUE:/FOR EXAMPLE, A SHOE./ AND THEN SEEWHAT HE'LL DO.(MORE)60CINDERELLA (CONT'D)NOW IT'S HE AND NOT YOU/ WHO'LL BESTUCK WITH A SHOE,/ IN A STEW,/ IN THEGOO,/ AND I'VE LEARNED SOMETHING,TOO,/ SOMETHING I NEVER KNEW,/ ON THESTEPS OF THE PALACE!Coming out of the freeze, she quickly leaves one shoe and
          slips on the other, then dashes off out of sight.
          The PRINCE picks up the golden shoe from the tar and holds it
          up triumphantly. He addresses his STEWARD and RETINUE.C'S PRINCEThe ball is over. Send everyone home.STEWARDAnd the Princess?C'S PRINCEShe won't get far with one shoe.EXT. WOODS - PATHWAY TO THE CASTLE - NIGHTCLOSE-UP on CINDERELLA'S FEET, awkwardly running with one
          shoe on, one shoe off.
          ANOTHER ANGLE. She hears someone close on her trail and looks
          back to see the wide-eyed WIFE in pursuit.CINDERELLADon't come any closer to me!WIFEPlease, stop! Just hear me out!CINDERELLAYou have attacked me once before.WIFEI didn't attack you. I attacked your
           shoe. I need it. I have a magic bean
           in exchange for it.
          Breathless, CINDERELLA stops. Stands defensively. The WIFE
          pulls out the bean from her pocket and hands it to her.CINDERELLAMagic bean? Nonsense!
          CINDERELLA tosses it over her shoulder, but they don't see
          the SPARKS it sets off when it hits the ground and sinks into
          the earth.
          She starts to leave.WIFEWait, please. I haven't much time!(DESPERATE)I need that shoe to have a child.61CINDERELLAThat makes no sense!WIFEDoes it make sense that you're running

          CINDERELLA dashes off.ON THE WIFE AND STEWARD.STEWARD(SUSPICIOUS)Stop! What is that you have in your
           hand?
          The WIFE hides the slipper behind her back. The STEWARD
          dismounts.WIFEIt's mine.STEWARD(gets off horse)
           Lying will cost you your life!
          The STEWARD snatches the shoe. The WIFE pushes the Steward
          and grabs the slipper back.WIFE(DESPERATE)I don't care if this costs me my
           life...STEWARDYou will pay for this!62The C-PRINCE rides in (with the other SLIPPER), followed by
          his RETINUE. The STEWARD takes the opportunity to pull the
          slipper from the WIFE'S hand as she curtsies.STEWARD (CONT'D)Sire! I have succeeded in obtaining
           the other slipper.
          He holds it up. The WIFE steps forward.WIFEPlease give me the slipper, kind
           Prince, and all will come to a happy
           end.STEWARD(OVERLAPPING)Step back, peon!C'S PRINCEDo as she says, Steward. We only need
           one.STEWARDOh...
          He hands the slipper back to the WIFE. The STEWARD gets onto

           maiden who fits this slipper.STEWARD(SURPRISED)Tonight?C'S PRINCEThis very night!
          The PRINCE, STEWARD and RETINUE ride off, leaving the WIFE
          alone. She looks up to the moon and hurries off.
          We follow the WIFE'S feet as she scurries past the beginnings
          of a BEANSTALK CURLING UPWARDS from the ground.BAKER (V.O.)And in her haste, the Baker's Wife
           took no notice of a second beanstalk
           climbing skyward.63EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUSTRUMPETS sound. The C-PRINCE, the STEWARD and the RETINUE

          the area in light.
          The STEPFAMILY watches as the STEWARD helps FLORINDA up on to
          the back of the Prince's horse. In pain, she grits her teeth
          in a frozen smile.BAKER (V.O.)Minus one toe, Florinda mounted the
           Prince's horse, unaware of the blood
           dripping from the slipper.
          As the STEWARD steps back, he notices a tiny speck of blood
          on his white glove. He looks up to the PRINCE to show him his
          hand. The PRINCE looks back to FLORINDA who shrugs
          sheepishly.INT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHTThis time the STEPMOTHER tries to force LUCINDA'S foot into

          "WOOSH" of a knife--EXT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - ENTRY COURTYARD - NIGHTThe PRINCE and STEWARD wait impatiently in the torchlight.BAKER (V.O.)Minus a heel, Lucinda did her best to
           swallow the pain.
          At last, LUCINDA appears, masking her pain with a smile, and
          limps towards the PRINCE. She is followed by her MOTHER andSISTER.65STEPMOTHERIt's a perfect fit, Your Highness!
          LUCINDA winks at the PRINCE flirtatiously, then promptly
          faints to the ground with a thud. The shoe falls from her
          foot. The PRINCE nods to the STEWARD who walks over and
          gingerly picks up the bloody slipper.C'S PRINCEHave you no other daughters?STEPMOTHEROnly a little stunted kitchen wench,
           which her late father left behind but
           she cannot present herself. She is too
           dirty.
          Out of the shadows, CINDERELLA appears.
          The STEWARD hands the slipper to the Prince, who kneels down
          in front of CINDERELLA and easily slips it on her foot.C'S PRINCEI would recognize these beautiful eyes
           anywhere. This is the true bride!
          The PRINCE sweeps CINDERELLA off her feet and leads her to
          his horse. The two of them ride off.
          FLORINDA and LUCINDA watch, not at all happy. Then they hear
          a CAWING (the sound of birds) overhead. They look up,
          alarmed.

          around his now blinded eyes, sits slumped over on his horse
          as the animal navigates its way through the marshy expanse.
          The R-PRINCE lifts his head as he hears RAPUNZEL'S singing.66Could it be? The horse, seemingly knowing the way, follows

          mound.WIFEWe're running out of time!BAKERIt's here...JACKWhat's happening?69BAKERShe's going to bring Milky-White back
           to life.JACK(AMAZED)She can do that?BAKERShe's a witch! She can do anything!JACKWow!WITCHStand back!
          They quickly move away, and the WITCH invokes some
          unintelligible incantation, and with the wave of her cape,
          the DEAD COW comes back to life, shaking off the leaves.
          JACK races over to her.JACKMilky-White. You're back! I missed you
           so much!
          The BAKER looks up at the MOON...only a slither left, the
          rest covered by SHADOW.BAKERIt's almost midnight!WITCHQuiet! Feed the objects to the cow.WIFEWhat?WITCHYou heard me! Feed them to the cow!
          The WIFE and BAKER walk towards the COW and begin feeding it
          a portion of the ingredients. Not an easy chew for the
          animal.
          The WITCH hands them a silver chalice.WITCH (CONT'D)Fill this!JACKI'll do it. She'll only milk for me.
          JACK begins milking the cow, the others watching intently,
          but alas, nothing is coming out.JACK (CONT'D)Squeeze, pal! You can do it.70He tries harder to no avail. The WITCH goes over and looks
          into the goblet. Nothing.WITCHWrong ingredients. Forget about a
           child!WIFEWait! We followed your instructions.
           One, the cow is as white as milk.
           Correct?WITCHYes.WIFEAnd two, the cape was certainly as red
           as blood.WITCHYes.WIFEAnd three, the slipper--WITCHYes.BAKERAnd four, I compared the hair with
           this ear of corn.WIFEI pulled it from a maiden in a towerAND--WITCHYou what?! What were you doing there?WIFEWell, nothing. I happened to bePASSING BY--WITCHI touched that hair! I told you! I
           cannot have touched the ingredients!BAKER/WIFE(MOANING)Nooooo...JACKThe corn! The corn!BAKERWhat?
          JACK grabs the ear of corn out of the BAKER'S hand.JACKYou can use the silky hair of the corn--71WITCHYes! Pull it from the ear and feed it
           to the cow. Quickly!
          The BAKER grabs the ear of corn from JACK, pulls the hair
          from the corn and feeds it to the cow.
          JACK begins milking the cow again. We hear the distant CHIMES
          OF MIDNIGHT begin.
          Light pours from above bathing them in a growing haze of BLUE
          LIGHT as the SHADOW finally eclipses the MOON. The COW lets
          out a BLOODCURDLING MOAN.WIFEIt's working!JACKShe's milking!
          The WITCH grabs the chalice.WITCHAt last!
          The WITCH drinks the potion. She begins to shake. Blue smoke
          begins to pour from her and swirl about as if she is trapped
          inside a cloud. The WIFE lets out a shriek..
          The BAKER looks at his WIFE, her belly begins to grow to nine-
          months-full of pregnancy.BAKERThat was quick!
          The cloud that has surrounded the WITCH now engulfs the area
          until a brisk wind blows it away, revealing a beautiful woman
          standing in the BLUE LIGHT of the FULL MOON. The WITCH has
          been restored to her former self, and she likes what she
          sees.
          The final CHIME OF MIDNIGHT is joined by every other BELL IN
          THE KINGDOM -- a joyous cacophony as we:CUT TO:EXT. ROAD TO KING'S CASTLE/KING'S CASTLE - A NEW DAYGOLDEN ROSE PETALS fill the air, swirling across the screen.
          PULLING BACK we see that the petals are being thrown by
          CHEERING SUBJECTS who toss more into the air as they clamor
          to catch a glimpse of CINDERELLA and her PRINCE on their
          wedding day.
          MUSIC. CINDERELLA'S carriage resplendent in gold drawn by
          black stallions passes. She sits demurely smiling as her
          PRINCE plays to the PASSERS-BY. This comes easily to him.72BAKER (V.O.)And it came to pass, all that seemed
           wrong was now right. The Witch
           succeeded in reversing her mother's
           curse. Cinderella finally stopped
           running from her Prince.
          CINDERELLA'S POV on the crowd.
          She sees JACK and his MOTHER waving; JACK'S MOTHER is over-
          dressed in brand new clothes including a ridiculous
          "fascinator" hat.BAKER (V.O.)Jack was reunited with his beloved cow
           and his mother could now dress in the
           best a golden egg could buy.
          Cinderella now sees the BAKER and his WIFE standing amongst
          the crowd, the WIFE holding their new BABY BOY.BAKER (V.O.)And the Baker and his Wife were proud
           parents of a strapping baby boy.
          The WIFE shows her the BABY.WIFE(calling to her)
           Thanks for the slipper.
          The carriage arrives at the entrance to the castle. As the
          PRINCE and CINDERELLA step from their carriage they are met
          by cheers.
          The STEPFAMILY awaits the married couple. The beaming
          STEPMOTHER with her DAUGHTERS who are now wearing dark
          glasses, holding canes and looking rather glum.
          RAPUNZEL stands with her PRINCE.
          The CROWD ROARS as CINDERELLA and her PRINCE wave.
          The STEWARD takes up a large speaking trumpet and the CROWD
          quiets.STEWARDLet us cheer the newlyweds as they
           embark on their happy bliss today, andEVER AFTER--BAKER (V.O.)And so with the kingdom filled with
           joy, those who deserved to were
           destined to live happily ever...73Suddenly the earth SHAKES with a mighty force, tossing
          CINDERELLA and her PRINCE (mid-kiss), along with their
          ATTENDANTS and the entire CROWD to the ground. A piece of the
          CASTLE comes CRASHING DOWN. Chaos ensues.
          JACK'S MOTHER stands up and looks around. No sign of JACK.JACK'S MOTHERJack? Jack...?
          ANGLE ON BAKER and his WIFE.BAKER(STUNNED)Are you alright?WIFEI think so.BAKERAnd the baby?WIFEYes, he's fine.
          There is another AFTERSHOCK.
          ANGLE ON RAPUNZEL. She is spooked by the commotion and runs
          off through the crowd and disappears.STEWARD(speaking into theHORN)Attention! Attention! Let there be no
           panic. NO PANIC! The Royal Prince
           wishes to address his loyal subjects.
           Attention!
          The R-PRINCE searches the crowd for RAPUNZEL. Those who
          haven't fled, quiet and gather around. The C-PRINCE takes the
          horn.C'S PRINCEThere's no need for worry. It was an
           earthquake in a far-off quadrant of
           our kingdom. Nothing to fear at all.
           As many of you know, we had another
           little shaker just days ago. I will
           personally investigate the
           disturbance. Now everyone, back to
           your villages, and on with your lives!EXT. KINGDOM - DAYA dense mist settles across the kingdom. In the distance a
          beanstalk stretches up to the sky. C'S PRINCE and his RETINUE
          gallop away from the destroyed castle into the woods.74BAKER (V.O.)But as they made their way back into
           the woods, their familiar paths were
           nowhere to be found and their lives
           were about to take an unexpected turn.EXT. WOODS - FLOWERED PATH - DAYThe BAKER and his WIFE are walking down a path -- or the
          remnants of a path.WIFEWhat's happened? Everything's so
           different.
          They discover LRRH sitting on her suitcase in what was once a
          lush area, now trampled and broken.BAKERHello, little one. Are you alright?
           What are you doing here? With a
           suitcase?LRRHI'm moving in with Granny. Our whole
           village collapsed. I couldn't find my
           mother anywhere. And now I can't find
           my Granny's cottage.BAKERWhat do you mean?LRRHI went down the dell, and I didn't
           recognize anything. There was no path.

           Where's the stream? Where's the
           bridge? Where's Granny?WIFECalm down.BAKERWe can help you find Granny's without
           the path.WIFEYes.
          The WIFE is exhausted. She hands the BABY to the BAKER.WIFE (CONT'D)Please take him for a few moments.
          The BAKER is clearly uncomfortable holding the BABY. They
          continue walking. The BABY begins to cry.BAKERWhy does he always cry when I hold
           him?75WIFEYou needn't hold him as if he was so
           fragile.
          The BABY wails. The BAKER hands the bundle back.BAKERHe doesn't want me. He wants his
           mother!WIFEI can't take care of him all of the
           time.BAKERI'll take care of him -- when he's
           older...
          They hear COMMOTION in the distance.WIFEWho might that be?BAKERIt's the Steward and the royal family.EXT. WOODS - TALL TREES - DAY - CONTINUOUSThrough a thick haze, the BAKER sees the STEWARD, the
          STEPFAMILY and a few SERVANTS carrying trunks and tending to
          the blind, hobbling STEPSISTERS.
          The BAKER makes his way to them with his WIFE and LRRH in
          tow.BAKERWhat brings you into the woods?STEWARDThe castle has been destroyed.WIFENo!STEPMOTHERThe kingdom is under attack.BAKERWhat is the Royal family going to do?STEWARDI have no idea! I don't make policy. I
           just carry it out.WIFE(to the Baker)
           I think it best we get back to the
           village. We'll take the girl with us.
          She holds out a hand for LRRH.76WIFE (CONT'D)You come with us.
          LRRH takes her hand.
          But then the ground begins to shake. A frightening and
          increasingly loud crunching noise. They fight for their
          footing.
          The STEPFAMILY drop their belongings and rush to each other.
          The BAKER puts his arm around his WIFE.
          Everyone's faces fill with terror as a huge shadow engulfs
          them.WIFE (CONT'D)It's a giant!BAKERA giant woman!
          Through the trees we see the furious face of a female GIANT.
          We never see her in her entirety -- but the volume of her
          voice matches her size.GIANTWhere is the lad who killed my
           husband?STEWARDThere is no lad here!BAKERWe haven't seen him.
          The WITCH, who has slipped in behind the group, comes forward
          startling everyone and moves directly to the GIANT.WITCHWe'll get him for you right away.
           Don't move!
          LRRH races past the WITCH and brandishes her knife.LRRHIt was you who destroyed our house -
           not an earthquake.GIANTAnd who destroyed my house? I want
           him!
          A great bellow that makes the trees shake.
          The WITCH moves towards the STEPSISTERS.WITCHWould you like a blind girl instead?77FLORINDA and LUCINDA scream. The STEPMOTHER takes them in her
          embrace.STEPMOTHERHow dare you? She wants the boy!
          And then JACK'S MOTHER arrives. Innocently, she asks the
          worst question possible.JACK'S MOTHERJack! Has anyone seen my Jack? He ran
           off again and I've been...
          Everyone stares at her. JACK'S MOTHER does a slow take
          looking up and discovering the GIANT.STEWARD(meaning the GIANT)
           She's looking for him too.GIANTGive him to me!
          The GIANT suddenly reaches down. They all quickly duck out of
          the way.
          JACK'S MOTHER runs forward to confront the GIANT.JACK'S MOTHERJack is just a lad! We had no food to
           eat so he sold his beloved cow in
           exchange for magic beans.GIANTThe boy - I want the boy!JACK'S MOTHERYou leave my boy alone!GIANTYou're making me very angry!
          The GIANT stomps her foot in anger.GIANT (CONT'D)I'm waiting!
          They all lose their balance. The STEWARD uses his staff to
          hold JACK'S MOTHER back, trying to silence her.STEWARDDon't make her angry, woman, or you'll
           get us all killed!
          But JACK'S MOTHER is in full flow, facing up to the GIANT.78JACK'S MOTHER(LOSING CONTROL)Flouncing through our kingdom with

          The STEWARD forcefully pulls JACK'S MOTHER behind him. She
          trips and falls.STEWARD (CONT'D)(to the GIANT)
           The boy is hiding in the steeple
           tower. You can find him there.STEPMOTHERYes, that's true.FLORINDA LUCINDAYes. The steeple tower. We saw him there!GIANTIf he is not, I will return tonight
           and find you! All of you!
          The GIANT takes off, the power of her footsteps forcing
          everyone to hold on to one another for safety.
          The BAKER'S WIFE sees JACK'S MOTHER, who is still lying on
          the ground. She goes to her.WIFELook! What have you done to her?STEWARDI didn't mean to hurt her. I was just
           thinking of the greater good.
          The BAKER steps forward, taking charge.BAKERListen everyone. If we're going to get
           through this we have to stick
           together.79STEPMOTHER(SINCERE)Some people are cut out to battle

           going. The giant's already destroyed
           the entire village. Only thing left of

          RAPUNZEL. She comes to their tower, now fallen. Sitting upon
          a pile of rubble, a bereft RAPUNZEL clutches her cape as she
          cries.WITCHRapunzel! You're safe! Thank goodness.80RAPUNZELWho are you?WITCHSurely you remember?(PLEASED)Of course you don't recognize me!RAPUNZEL(STUNNED)Mother?WITCHThis is who I truly am, my dear. Now

          She moves towards RAPUNZEL -- but suddenly the R-PRINCE rides
          up on his white steed. He jumps off and rushes to RAPUNZEL.R'S PRINCEMy darling. Are you all right? Why did

          RAPUNZEL pulls away and turns on the WITCH.RAPUNZELI will not come with you!WITCHThen you leave me no choice.
          The WITCH pulls RAPUNZEL behind her and tries to cast a spell
          on R'S PRINCE. Nothing. She tries again. Still nothing.

          -- the BAKER and JACK use their slings to fire stones at theGIANT.-- JACK shimmies to the end of a high limb for better aim.
          -- The GIANT reaches blindly towards JACK.106LRRH (CONT'D)Look out Jack!
          -- The GIANT seizes hold of the branch where JACK is standing
          which knocks JACK off. JACK catches himself on the way down,
          grabbing the branch, and hangs on for dear life. Using one
          hand, JACK whirls his sling and delivers a knock-out blow to
          the GIANT'S forehead.
          -- The GIANT reacts and begins to sway.
          BAKER'S POV of the GIANT'S eye as she fall towards him.
          The GIANT'S hand grabs some tree branches, as she fights for
          her balance. We hear the crackling branches as the GIANT
          FALLS pulling the tree down with her, snapping it in a final
          deafening THUD.EXT. WOODS - TALL TREES - NIGHT - CONTINUOUSCINDERELLA and LRRH run around the gigantic, exposed roots.CINDERELLAWhere are they?LRRHJack? Mr. Baker?CINDERELLAJack?JACKOver here!LRRHJack!LRRH (CONT'D)(TO LRRH)Will you take him.
          LRRH takes the BABY as CINDERELLA helps JACK out of the tree
          roots.CINDERELLAOh, be careful, are you alright?JACKWhere is he?CINDERELLAHe's not with you?LRRHMr. Baker?
          All three feverishly look for him.107BAKERJack, Jack!JACKHelp me. Help me!BAKERJack, I'm here.
          CINDERELLA helps JACK lift the tree branch as the BAKER,
          breathless, crawls out from beneath its grasp. He is
          scratched up, but relieved. CINDERELLA takes the BABY fromLRRH.CINDERELLALet me take him.BAKER(To Jack then LRRH)
           Are you okay? Are you alright? We did
           it! We did it! Come here.
          They embrace the BAKER. There's a moment of realization of
          what just happened as they look up at the roots of the fallen
          tree.BAKER (CONT'D)Now we can all return home.JACKWhat home? I have no one to take care
           of me.LRRH(to the BAKER)
           And we have nowhere to go, so we'll
           move in with you.BAKERWELL --He hesitates then:BAKER (CONT'D)-- of course you can come home with
           me.JACK(TO CINDERELLA)And you can come, too.BAKERIf you want to.CINDERELLAI'll gladly help you with your house.
           There are times when I actually enjoy
           cleaning.108The BABY begins to whimper. The BAKER walks towards
          CINDERELLA and his SON.BAKERHere -- give him to me.
          The BAKER walks away from the group, trying to settle his
          SON. He wraps his SCARF around the BABY.BAKER (CONT'D)(to the BABY)
           Hey, hey, hey, come on now. Hey,
           please, come on, come on, it's okay. I
           know you miss your mother.
          The BAKER sits on a fallen tree trunk.BAKER (CONT'D)I miss her too.
          The BABY cries.BAKER (CONT'D)Sssh!
          The BABY still cries.BAKER (CONT'D)MAYBE I JUST WASN'T MEANT TO HAVECHILDREN--The BAKER hears his WIFE'S voice. We see her over his
          shoulder.WIFEDON'T SAY THAT!/ OF COURSE YOU WEREMEANT TO HAVE CHILDREN.BAKERBUT HOW CAN I GO ABOUT BEING A FATHER/WHEN I HAD NO FATHER TO SHOW ME?WIFEJUST CALM THE CHILD.BAKERYES, CALM THE CHILD.WIFELOOK, TELL HIM THE STORY/ OF HOW ITALL HAPPENED./ BE FATHER AND MOTHER,/YOU'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO.BAKERALONE...109WIFESOMETIMES PEOPLE LEAVE YOU/ HALFWAYTHROUGH THE WOOD./ DO NOT LET ITGRIEVE YOU,/ NO ONE LEAVES FOR GOOD./YOU ARE NOT ALONE./ NO ONE IS ALONE.HOLD HIM TO THE LIGHT NOW./ LET HIMSEE THE GLOW./ THINGS WILL BE ALLRIGHT NOW./ TELL HIM WHAT YOU KNOW...BAKERShhhh.
          As the Baker holds his son close, the baby begins to calm
          down for the first time in his father's arms and his WIFE
          disappears.
          The BAKER tells the story to his son -- THE SAME STORY AS WEHEARD AT THE BEGINNING.BAKER (CONT'D) WITCH (V.O.)Once upon a time...in a far CAREFUL THE THINGS YOU SAY,/

          newly formed family. As the BAKER continues to tell the story
          the CAMERA SLOWLY PULLS UP overhead to reveal the vast woods,
          now changed by the Giant's path.
          The CAMERA then carries us back beyond the woods and to the
          Village where we see the destruction that has visited it.WITCH & ALL (V.O.)CAREFUL THE WISH YOU MAKE,/ WISHES ARECHILDREN./ CAREFUL THE PATH THEY TAKE--/ WISHES COME TRUE,/ NOT FREE.CAREFUL THE SPELL YOU CAST,/ NOT JUSTON CHILDREN./ SOMETIMES THE SPELL MAYLAST/ PAST WHAT YOU CAN SEE/ AND TURNAGAINST YOU...110The CAMERA finally pans up from the Village to the sky and we
