                                Annie Mumolo8/12/09INT. CLEAN, UPSCALE. MODERN BATHROOM.Annie is in nice lingerie, happily getting ready for the
          day. She puts a lot of effort into her appearance.
          Products everywhere, too many hair-flips, eye-cream, no
          hair out of place.
          She walks into the bedroom, where TED, a gorgeous man
          sleeps. She sneaks back into the bed, carefully
          positioning herself and moving the sheets to show her
          good parts.
          She coughs and nudges Ted to wake him up then pretend
          sleeps.TEDGood morning.
          Annie pretends to wake up.TED (CONT'D)Wow, you look beautiful.ANNIE(ACTING EMBARRASSED)What? No. I don't. Oh my God its the
          morning. I look terrible. I just woke up.TEDLast night was fun.ANNIEYeah, I had the best time. I have't had
          that much fun on a first date in years,
          ever...
          She brushes the hair off his forehead as if he were her
          long time lover.TEDSo listen Annie, I like you. So, I want
          to be up front with you. I'm not really
          looking for a relationship right now.
          Annie's eyes grow large. She uncomfortably smiles at him,
          nodding.ANNIEOooooo. Oops. I mean, yeah. What?TEDI just want to be honest right off the
          bat.2.ANNIEYeah, yeah. Ok. Yeah. Yeah. I love that.
          Annie struggles to maintain her composure.TEDI'm just so busy and I don't have time
          for another person...I...ANNIEYeah, me too, I'm soo busy--TEDAnd summer's coming--ANNIEYeah, summer, exactly. It's a crazy
          season. So you just wanna give me a call
          in the fall or--?TEDYeah, I'm not gonna be in town much even
          in the fall--ANNIEYou shouldn't be! Yeah, Halloween--TEDI'm gonna be travelling a lot for work.ANNIEMe too, I'm just- so many business trips
          to places that are just far away‘cause
          I'm doing really well at work.TEDAnd honestly, (sits up) I don't even know
          how I feel about the whole monogamy
          thing, is one person really enough for
          anyone? I mean, I like to be with a lot
          of different people.ANNIEIt is sooo refreshing to hear you say
          that, because isn't that what everyone
          thinks but is afraid to say? I mean, i's
          science. I'm-I don't want a relationship
          either. Let's just say that. And I
          wouldn't even care whatever you do or I
          do, I just wanna have tons of fun, like
          no strings attached at all. I'm just
          different from other girls.3.TEDYeah. Well anyway, I really should get
          going. I was gonna get a haircut today.ANNIEYeah, they say that every couple months
          it's good to trim the ends, you know, get
          all the dead stuff. So, cool. Cool. 've
          cut hair before.
          He waits, but Annie doesn't budge.TEDWell, like I said I got stuff to do.
          Annie notices a picture of a sailboat above the bed.ANNIEYeah, me too. Gonna try to get some
          sailing in before the weather gets
          crazy...TED HOLLYCool, well I don't wanna be Get up the jib..
          late.
          Ted gets up. Awkward moment leading into...EXT. HOUSE. FRONT DOOR. MOMENTS LATER.TEDOh, and thanks for the lemon bars.ANNIEOh, no problem. Made from scratch.EXT. DRIVEWAYAnnie stands at the closed driveway gate waiting as Ted
          repeatedly presses the button. She smiles at a neighbor.TEDSometimes it sticks!ANNIENo, I love it!
          The gate starts to open. Annie exits.ANNIE (CONT'D)Byyyyee!4.EXT. STREET. OUTSIDE THE GATEAnnie sits in her old shitty car. She lets out an
          exasperated sigh, then sees the clock.ANNIEOh, shit.
          The brakes squeak as she very slowly drives away.INT. ANNIE'S CAR IN TRAFFIC. CONTINUOUS.Annie gets out her phone and speed dials LILLIAN.INT. LILLIAN'S BEDROOM.Lillian is getting dressed. Upscale, professional
          clothes.LILLIANIt's summer?! What the hell does that
          mean? He can't date anyone in the summer?ANNIEI guess? I don't know. I feel so stupid
          now.LILLIANNo he's stupid Ann, not you.ANNIEI think I might be a little bit stupid.LILLIANEw. Did you have sex with him?ANNIENo! But I gave him a blow job.LILLIANWhat?!ANNIEWell, he kept putting it in my face.
          Lillian's boyfriend DOUGIE enters the bedroom eating a
          Luna Bar in his sweats. He's stretching and flexing his
          muscles trying to make her laugh.5.LILLIANWell, at least he was honest with you so
          you don't waste your time with him.DOUGIEBaby, look how hard I worked out. Look at
          all this sweat.LILLIANCan you see that I'm on the phone? I'm
          talking to Annie.DOUGIEHey Annie.LILLIANAre you eating my Luna Bar? Those are for
          women you know?DOUGIEShit. Really?!LILLIANIt's not gonna do anything to you.DOUGIEOh my God. My breasts are getting bigger.
          He tries to rub up against Lillian.LILLIANEw, go take a shower.
          Dougie leaves.DOUGIE (O.S.)I'm gonna play with my new boobs in
          there.LILLIANI swear I cannot handle him right now. He
          has been driving me crazy. Sometimes it
          feels like I'm kissing my brother. I
          don't know what do.
          Annie pulls into an alleyway behind HARRINGTO'S JEWELRY
          STORE and starts changing into her work uniform in the
          car. A white blouse and navy skirt.ANNIEAt least you have someone. God, wha's
          wrong with me?6.LILLIANThere's nothing wrong with you. But I
          think maybe, and don't get mad at me,
          I've said this to you before, you need to
          stop trying so hard.ANNIEI still don't think I do that.LILLIANOK, so you had a first date last night.
          Did you bring him a present?
          Annie is silent.LILLIAN (CONT'D)Ann, what did I tell you?ANNIEI brought him lemon-bars because I was
          making them anyway, as a friend. Yo're
          right, that's weird.DOUGIE (O.S.)Shit!LILLIANWhat?!DOUGIE (O.S)I just chipped a nail!LILLIANOk, I don't know if it's because I'm
          tired or what, but I wanna kill him.ANNIEOk, just take a deep breath, look in the
          mirror and remember when I was getting my
          braces off and farted at the
          orthodontist.
          Lillian laughs.LILLIANOh my God. We need to hang out. 'm
          coming to Milwaukee this weekend.ANNIEAre you serious?7.LILLIANWe'll go to Joni's and pig out and I'll
          bring some shitty magazines, and I'm
          gonna spend the night.ANNIEGod, I haven't seen you in months!LILLIANI'll call you tomorrow. Bye.
          They hang up. Dougie is in the doorway wearing her
          nightie stretched over his body.DOUGIEBaby, I'm going through some changes...LILLIAN(laughing) You're an idiot.
          We see she gets a kick out of him.INT. HARRINGTON'S JEWELRY STORE.Annie enters hurriedly pulling her hair into a bun.ANNIEHi. Sorry, sorry! I'm here. I'm here.DONNA(quickly) Annie! Thank God. OK people!
          Gather around me please, in a tight
          semicircle.
          Annie and six other employees gather around DONNA.DONNA (CONT'D)(slightly overdramatic) Something
          terrible has happened. Donald will not
          be coming in to work today. He stepped
          on a wasp and there is some uncomfortable
          swelling.
          Employees mumble.DONNA (CONT'D)Annie? Where's your tie?
          Everyone looks at Annie. She holds it up and starts to
          put it on.8.DONNA (CONT'D)Now, I have an eye doctor's appointment
          that I can't change or they'll will
          charge me. So someone will have to cover
          for Donald in engagement rings. Now I--
          Annie and SANDY, a male co-worker, shoot their hands the
          air eagerly.DONNA (CONT'D)Sandy? Today's your day.SANDYOoh, my horoscope said I would be
          presented with an opportunity at work
          today. That is eerie. That is eerie.DONNAAnnie, that means you'll be alone in
          keepsakes. You think you can handle it?EMPLOYEE (SOTTO)Yeah, look out. There might be a bum-
          rush for letter openers...
          The employees snicker.ANNIESometimes there is, so....there have
          been. At times, there has been.DONNAAlright everybody, let's get to work!
          Saneel?!...OPEN SESAME!
          SANEEL, the security guard, rolls his eyes and unlocks
          the doors. Everyone goes to work. Donna gathers her
          things and starts walking towards the exit with Annie
          tailing behind her.ANNIEDonna, can I talk to you for a second? I
          feel like if you gave me a shot at
          engagement rings sometime, I could really-DONNAAnnie, what is the calibration of a 2
          carat diamond in a standard English
          setting?ANNIEFive?9.DONNAI just made all of that up. None of that
          was real. I just put words together.
          You're not ready for the big leagues.
          Understand?ANNIEIt's so hard to make commission over
          there.DONNASweetheart...did I ever tell you the
          story of the little paralyzed Chinese
          girl who wanted to be dancer?ANNIEMany times.DONNAShe was paralyzed Annie, had no feeling
          in her legs, and then one day after years
          of believing in herself, she stood up out
          of that chair and tap-danced for the
          king. On his birthday! My point is, Sandy
          makes a real effort around here. He
          connects with the customer. And when he
          wants to make a sale, he goes for it.ANNIEOkay. (beat) I do want it.DONNA(smiling) Good. Showing up on time is a
          wonderful place to start.
          Donna talks to herself and gathers her things.DONNA (CONT'D)Uhh! A wasp! Who walks around even their
          own backyard without at least a thin
          sandal. It's reckless!
          Donna exits. A customer passes Anni's section.ANNIEHello, can I interest you in a sterling
          silver money clip that will create
          memories for you and your family? No?
          We cut to a HOME IMPROVEMENT SHOW on T.V.10.T.V. HOSTWhen Dave and Rhonda bought this house,
          it was a medical clinic. I've never seen
          so many cupboards!INT. ANNIE AND STEVE'S APT. THAT NIGHT.STEVE, Annie's mid-thirties roommate, sits on the couch
          shirtless and is enthralled by the show.STEVENoooo. That's, that's sooo smart.
          Annie enters the apartment, tired. She throws her keys
          down and sifts through her mail. Steve presses mute.STEVE (CONT'D)There you are, you stayer-out-all-
          nighter. Did you make out? Sleep over?
          As Annie heads for her bedroom, he walks towards her
          room.STEVE (CONT'D)Don't go in the bathroom. Are you going
          to bed?ANNIEYes. I'm beat.STEVEYour ex-boyfriend got more mail, I did
          what you said and just threw it away.ANNIEThanks. Goodnight Steve!
          She shuts the door behind her.STEVEThat credit lady called! She wants to
          talk to you, Annie! She's gonna find you.
          Steve sits back on the couch, un-mutes the T.V..ALLEN (ON SHOW)This is where they bagged the animals
          that didn't make it through the testing.

          post-it that reads, “Love, Mom”. She plays it and lies
          down. We hear a loud Tibetan woma's voice wailing. NOT
          relaxing. She turns it off and curls up on top of her
          bed.INT. JONI'S RESTAURANT. THAT FRIDAY NIGHT.Annie and Lillian read magazines.ANNIEYou're right. God, she's getting really
          skinny.LILLIANAnn.ANNIEWhat?LILLIAN(quietly) Your boyfriend just walked in.

          legs in a tiny muscle tank and shorts.ANNIEOh my God! Look, he showed up with your
          mom.
          It's a short grey-haired OUTDOORSEY WOMAN in hiking
          boots. They laugh to themselves. Annie keeps reading.ANNIE (CONT'D)Cool! They're making a WKRP movie.LILLIANHere Annie, let me turn the page for you.ANNIEWhat?
          Lillian splays her hand over the magazine showing off a
          sparkling DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING.12.LILLIAN(playfully) I just want to help you turn
          the page of your magazine for you...ANNIELillian! What is that?!LILLIANI'm engaged.ANNIEWhat?!!LILLIANHe proposed at dinner last night. I
          wanted to tell you in person and show you

          is...this is crazy!LILLIANI know Dougie and I have been fighting a
          lot, but I've been so stressed out withWORK--ANNIEThat's not I mean. I mean, I remember
          when we met him at Lake Mills. You lost
          your virginity to him right in front of
          me on the dock, remember?LILLIANOh you want to get into who's done what
          down at the lake?ANNIENo, I don't. It's just making me realize
          how long we've known each other.LILLIANWell then, who better to be my Maid of
          Honor?ANNIEOh my God! I don't know what to say!LILLIANAnnie, you're my best friend. Honestly I
          didn't even have to think about it.13.ANNIEUh, wow. Yes! Of course! Yes! My God.
          I've never been in a wedding.LILLIANIt's no big deal, and I don't want to
          make it one. It's not gonna be a big
          crazy thing. I wanna keep it simple.
          (beat) What dessert are you gonna get?ANNIEI know what you're doing. Don't downplay
          this. I'm happy for you. And someday when
          hell freezes over and I get married, you
          can be my Maid of Honor. But for right
          now, this is about you. OK? This is
          you're day, and it is a big deal.LILLIANOk, but I still don't want this to be a
          huge production. I just want to have all
          my friends meet each other, have fun,
          dance, drink, whatever.ANNIEThen that's what it'll be. Did you guys
          set a date?LILLIANOh God, not yet. I don't want a super
          long engagement, but there's a lot to do.ANNIEWell you are very fortunate because you
          happen have the best maid of honor in the
          whole wide world, and--
          Lillian's cell phone rings, she looks at it and smiles.LILLIAN(mocking) Can you hold that thought. I's
          my fiancee calling.
          Lillian gets up laughing. Annie laughs along with her.ANNIEOoo, haha...
          Annie continues laughing alone. She looks around the room
          as her smile disappears. She remembers...14.FLASHBACK. EXT. LILLIAN'S COTTAGE. LAKE MILLS.- 1980 -DAY.Annie and Lillian at 7 years old standing outside eating

          She finds the article. “Hurry, before he gets away! Top
          five ways to reel him in.”MAN (O.S)Excuse me.
          A HOT ATHLETIC GUY with his golden retriever is reaching
          for a magazine. She can't thing of what to say. She
          remembers the magazine! It reads “#1. A simple, flirty�'Sworking! Her cell phone rings, she tries to ignore it,
          but it keeps ringing...ANNIEHello?HELEN (ON PHONE)Annie!?ANNIEYes?
          It's HELEN (early 30's) Lillian's bridesmaid and friend
          from the tennis Club. She's a tall leggy blond, all
          smiles. East coast pretty with a lot of cream cashmere
          turtleneck sweaters in her closet. She is sitting in a
          cream colored living room on a huge cream couch with lots
          of candles glowing.INTERCUT:HELENHi.ANNIEHi.HELENHiiii! This is Helen. I'm one of
          Lillian's bridesmaids.16.ANNIEOf course, Helen. Hi!HELENCongratulations on being selected.ANNIEOh, thank you.
          Annie, reads “#2. Expose your best asset. ASAP” She
          panics, starts to elongate her right leg, points her toe,
          flexes her leg, flips her hair. He seems confused but
          politely smiles and goes back to his magazine.HELENAnnie?ANNIESorry, yes. Hi!HELENMaid of Honor!!ANNIEYeah. It is quite an honor.HELENIt's the number one spot. So how many
          times have you been in the B.P?ANNIEI'm sorry, the what?HELENBridal Party?ANNIEI've never even been in a wedding before.HELENWhat!? I've never even heard of that.ANNIEUm, well, it should be fun.
          Annie sees that the hot guy is leaving to pay for his
          magazine! She reads“#5. Make a funny observational joke
          that pertains to HIM. (ya know, LIKE SEINFELD!!] Men LOVE� SHEand the golden retriever meet eyes.ANNIE (CONT'D)Um Helen, can you hold on for a second?17.HELENOH--Annie covers the phone and approaches the hot guy.ANNIEHey, you're dog's really cute.MANOh thanks.ANNIEIt's kinda funny right? That when girls
          are ugly, they're called dogs, but dogs
          are cute.
          Annie laughs. He half smiles but does not respond.ANNIE (CONT'D)(beat) Well, some dogs are ugly. Some
          girls are ugly. I know a lot of ugly
          girls. But I'm not friends with them.
          I've seen a lot of ugly dogs too. But
          some people I know who are considered
          dogs, you know, they have a good
          personality, and are better looking to
          people cuz of that. And people who are
          not nice...that's ugly to me. And female
          dogs are called bitches, that's weird.
          I'm just kidding. It's a joke. I have
          better ones.
          The guy leaves. She hears a voice coming from her phone.HELEN'S VOICEHello?!ANNIEHelen! Sorry. Yeah um, I'm really excited
          for all the wedding stuff and--HELENYAY! OK, I will get your e-mail from
          Lilly with all of the other girls'
          information, and when you respond to any
          wedding related e-mails from now on, just
          remember to hit “REPLY ALL”. Did you know
          there are six of us?ANNIEYeah, Lillian told me last night.
          Awkward silence.18.HELENWell, can't wait to meet you and hear

          fill you in--HELENOop! There goes my other line. See you
          Friday!
          She realizes there might some research to do for this
          ‘bridal party' thing. She instead grabs two wedding
          magazines.ANNIEJust these.

          handle it.

          friends who set us up.RHODESJust tell her the truth.ANNIEYeah. You're probably right.
          Now Rhodes and Annie are driving in his police car.ANNIE (CONT'D)It's an ok job. It's commission, so it's
          unpredictable. I don't know, I always
          wanted to finish my bachelor's but that's
          kind of financially impossible right now.
          Plus I'd feel like ninety around all
          those college students.59.RHODESYou know my dad used to say that life is
          like a hallway of doors. You can stand at
          the same door forever if you want. Or you
          can open a different door. And that one
          may not be the right door, but i'll open
          up a whole new hallway of doors. Anyway,
          it worked for me. I was kinda lost and I
          opened a door and the next thing I knew I
          was a cop. And I love my job.ANNIEHmm. I think I get it?RHODESOr you can always sell moon-pies by the

          that I lived with broke up with me over

          that technically be me? Honor?HELENWell, no, sweetie, you're the Maid of
          Honor, and we're all bridesmaids, and out
          of all of us, I'm the leader. Anyway, it
          doesn't matter. Um, I wanted to get
          something that we could wear to the
          rehearsal dinner or something. That would
          be fun. Where are the diamonds?ANNIEOh, well, what about a nice pen..or a

          in when it gets to a quarter tank.
          Especially cause you have such a shitty
          car.ANNIEThanks. Can I ask you a question? What do
          you think of Vegas?STEVEOoo. Let me turn this off. Vegas is a
          black hole but I must have it in my life.
          Does that make sense?ANNIEI'm just asking because some of the girls
          are talking about going for Lillia's
          bachelorette party and I've never been.64.STEVEOh no. Now I don't know about weddings.
          When you go on a bachelorette, does the
          bride pay?ANNIENo, everyone pays for themselves. And you
          pay for the bride.STEVEOk, I'm gonna say no. You cannot afford
          that. Vegas is not cheap. Airfare,
          hotels, food, cars, drinks, clubs, show
          tickets. Remember this morning? You
          cannot afford Vegas.ANNIEWell, I could save up for it.STEVENo, you need to win a contest to go to
          Vegas/You had gum for lunch yesterday.
          Ooh, “Night Moves.” Can I have this?
          A lightbulb goes off in Annie's head. Steve holds the
          blazer out and reads the tag.ANNIETold you I'd pay you back!
          Annie runs into her room. She sits down at the computer
          and begins typing feverishly.

          “bachelorette party”, “Florida”, “Sea World!”, “Free

          I were kids we went there and she loved
          it and has always talked about going
          back. Ask Dougie. I think it would really
          mean a lot to her. We could stay at my
          Dad's house, he won't even be there. Then
          we could go out at night and got to the
          beach and then Sea World on one of the
          days.HELENBut a bachelorette at Sea World?ANNIELike I said, Sea World would just be a
          part of it.HELENWell, I have been talking to the other

          had naturally curly hair, and skin black
          as night. But one evening at a dinner
          party I walked in on her in the bathroom
          putting a vile of cocaine up her buttocks
          and last I heard, she was playing the
          saxophone outside of a drug store. And
          I'm gonna say something to you I should
          have told her. Don't waste your life.

          It is a beautiful pink and white striped box with her
          name and address in calligraphy. When Annie opens the
          lid, “Canon in D” plays and a real butterfly flies out.100.She reads, “A Shower for Lillian.” Steve comes over to
          see.
          On one side of the box, there is a beautiful sculpture of
          Lillian and Dougie as Bride and Groom, a candle with
          Lillian's face printed on it and some chocolates. Annie
          takes the invitation out, opens it quickly.ANNIE (CONT'D)Are you kidding me?

          the phone to her Mom, who is painting a very life-like
          picture of Enrique Iglesias in concert.JUDYIs there an animal over there?ANNIENo, it's a C.D.
          She rolls over and turns it off.JUDYSo, I'm flying straight to O'Hare the day

          let her new friends get in the way of
          your being a part of one of the best days
          of Lil's life. NO way. You have a history
          with her that no one else has. So you
          walk into that party knowing that.102.INT. ANNIE'S CAR.Annie drives to Helen's. She sees a pink and white
          highway sign (that looks like a traditional highway exit
          sign) “Lillian's Shower Rue. This exit”ANNIEOh my God.
          She turns into the gates of “Whitewater Estates.” There
          is, a life-size sculpture of a bride and groom. As she
          gets closer, she sees they are real life models. They
          smile at Annie, wink at her and wave her by.
          At the next stop sign, a butler appears with a tray.BUTLERAre you a guest of Helen Harris?ANNIEYes.BUTLERThe shower is one mile away.
          He hands her a pink lemonade.ANNIEI don't have a cup-holder.
          As she's driving, little pink things start to fly beside
          her car.ANNIE (CONT'D)WHAT THE-One flies in her car. They're Rose petals!
          Annie's shitty car drives down a road covered with Rose
          petals. At the driveway, she is greeted by a valet in a
          pink bow-tie and beret. As she reaches for her gift from
          the passenger seat, another valet opens that door and
          take it.VALETThis will be placed in the gift room for
          you madame.
          He reaches for the cookies she made, and she stops him.ANNIEI'll take those.103.Annie watches the valet drives her car away. When she
          turns back around, there is a man with a white horse
          holding out his hand to her.HORSEMANWould you like an assisted ride to the
          main house?ANNIEDo I have to?
          An annoyed Annie arrives at the house on the horse with
          the man leading her on foot, holding the cookies. She
          dismounts.
          The front door is swung open by two attendants. As she
          enters the mansion, groups of girls pass by her...SHOWER GIRLSThis is the most amazing shower 've ever
          been to/Can you believe this?/What a
          lucky bride/What a good friend...
          Helen's house is ALL cream and white with gold. Couches
          are puffy, etc. Annie walks to the backyard. We hear
          French standards. Beautiful tables are set. Swans and
          bunnies milling about. Attendants ready to serve. In the
          middle of everything stands an eight foot tall round
          “sign” that says “Lillian and Dougie” in puffy pink
          cursive. A waiter offers Annie champagne. She takes it.BECCA AND LESLIE(O.S.)Annie!
          They walk to her.LESLIEDo you believe this shit?
          Annie is still staring at the sign.BECCAThat's a big cookie huh.ANNIEWhere?
          They point to the “sign”. Annie walks closer to see it is
          indeed a huge cookie.LESLIESee. Sugar cookie.104.Leslie takes a piece off, eats it.LESLIE (CONT'D)It's even better if you dip it in the
          chocolate.
          REVEAL a glorious four tiered chocolate fountain. Girls
          are around it dipping strawberries and pieces of the big
          cookie, laughing. Helen is there taking their praise.
          Annie is pissed and plops her tupperware of cookies on a
          nearby table.LILLIANAnnieee!!!

          pits yellow! AND you know when we were in
          Vegas? When you were all staying at your
          luxury hotel? I was staying at Hotel RICK
          where got BODY LICE! So Helen, you can

          and it says, “Officer Rhodes”. He's a little weary but

          It's Rhodes, leaning against his car like Jake in sixteen
          candles. Annie is all smiles and walks up to him.ANNIEHow did you know I was here?RHODESIt was really complicated. I remembered
          the name of this place, I called them up,
          told them I was a cop calling on official
          police business, doing a very big
          investigation and uh, made them tell me
          all the weddings they had planned for the
          next two months with a bride named
          Lillian. [ALT: I'm a cop]

          completely covered in ants.ANNIEOoo, I didn't think about that.137.RHODESYou probably should have put it in a
          plastic wrap or maybe a foil or
          something. Tupperware would've worked but
          then I'd have to get it back to you-I'm
          gonna kiss you right now so...
          He walks to her and takes her in his arms. They are about
          to kiss.
          Rhodes stops.RHODES (CONT'D (CONT'D)I didn't want to miss my chance again.ANNIE(SMILING)Me neither.

          He opens his hand to reveal the ugly carrot. She smiles.
          He stops the car and unlocks the passenger door. She gets
          in. They drive off into the sunset.
