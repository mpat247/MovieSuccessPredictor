	totes a skateboard under one arm (itself a berserk Jackson
	Pollock chaos of band stickers, silver marker and graffiti, with
	day-glo wheels), and transfers her impromptu bouquet so she may

	LAO, a painfully clean-cut, Armani-clad Asian, impeccable,
	almost dashing, but the dynamic here is crystal clear: Nwa is
	the King: Lao, the dark prince in this hierarchy.

	At the desk, Lao is startled from his contemplation of a tiny,
	perfect rat skeleton by Ngo Nwa's unheralded entry.  The desktop
	is bare except for and Arcane Vietnamese fighting knife, half a
	meter long with an ideogrammed blade, dramatically positioned
	beneath an Artemide lamp.  Lao rises and feigns servility.

	the oppulent office, indicating that Lao should be grateful, but 
	is somehow errantNWA(respect is required)LAO(begrudging agreement)

	Lao sees the blade.  An idea.  He lifts it reverently, bears it
	the Nwa hilt-first in both hands, as if bestowing a thing of
	immeasurable worth.NGO NWA(why give me this?)

	Nonetheless, Nwa accepts the blade.  It gleams.  Hypnotic. Even
	Nwa has to admire it.  Turns it so the blade is pointed at his
	sternum.  His attitude indicates Lao is too far away to do
	anything untoward.LAO(sinister punchline)

	Lao spins through the air and HEEL-KICKS the blade THROUGH Nwa's
	chest, pinning him to the door.  It's over so fast the gasp of
	astonishment never escapes Nwa.  Lao is much more than merely 
	treacherous, he is extremely capable.LAO(in perfect English)

	affirmatively.GRANGEYou gonna smoke his bones now, or
