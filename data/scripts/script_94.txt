	childlike.  Nestled soundly a tangle in the arms of his wife.THE CAMERA STAYS CLOSE.  SLIGHTLY BLURRED, SOFT, SLOWLYSWINGS ROUNDTIGHT CLOSE - SALLY THERRIANShe's in her mid-thirties, with large deep eyes.  She watches
	her husband unguarded in sleep.  Her pretty face, alert,
	she's barely breathing.  Traces the just visible lines around
	his eyes, and mouth.  Brushes fingertips against his
	eyelashes.TIGHT CLOSE - SALLY'S HAND PULLS THE BEDROOM SHADE.It retracts with a loud WHACK, sun, sky, trees.STEVEN (O.S.)And breath...and chataronga...EXT. POOL AREA - DAYWe're in the middle of a yoga lesson.  Joe and Sally stand on
	their mats.  Steven, their instructor, wanders around the
	couple issuing soft-spoken instructions.

	A large room with hard wood floors, dominated by a huge
	fireplace.  The dining room on one side, living room on the
	other.  Floor to ceiling windows overlook the back porch
	garden pool... The house is classic Neutra.  All GLASS andSMOOTH LINES.The calm is broken by the telephone.  Joe and Sally ignore it
	until the answering machine picks up.  They break their yoga
	poses and listen.

	The CAMERA hovers over the answering machine.LUCY (O.S.)(over answering machine; sweet,
			 British, slightly desperate)
		Joe, it's Lucy.  Remember me?  It's the
		black sheep here.  Bah...not funny.
		Haven't heard from you, need you, call
		me.  Love you madly.  Hi, Sally.  Joe,
		I'd love to talk to you before I go...JOEGo where?LUCY (O.S.)(over answering machine)
		It's a damn nuisance you aren't here, big

		I lo--

	The machine cuts her off.NEW ANGLEJoe and Sally have resumed their positions.  This wasn't the
	call they were waiting for.WIDE SHOTAMERICA, forty-one, and ROSA, fifty, struggle up the steps of
	the back porch carrying grocery bags and packages, come
	through the sliding glass door...THE CAMERA FOLLOWS THEMThrough the dining room and into the kitchen, watches the two
	unpack groceries, flowers, etc., and start to dress the
	dining room table.  They speak quietly to each other in
	Spanish.JOEAmerica, could you just...

	America closes the sliding doors between the kitchen and the
	dining room, giving the couple their privacy.JOE (CONT'D)(calls out)
		Thank you, America!STEVENOkay, let's just take a deep breath, let
		your ribs expand and relax.  And reach up
		and into downward dog.

	Otis, the Bisenji/Sheperd mix, sleeping on his leopard
	pillow, stirs, stretches and groans.JOE AND SALLYGood boy, Otis.

	The phone RINGS again.VOICE (O.S.)(over answering machine)
		Hello, I have Dr. Harmon calling for
		Sally Therrian.

	Sally jumps out of the down dog position and runs to the
	phone, all angles.SALLYHello, hi, hi...and?  Thank God.

	Sally stands with the phone to her ear, her back to Joe.EXT. POOL AREA - CONTINUOUSJoe watches her from his position, not concentrating on the
	teacher waiting a sign.  Sally returns to the lesson.  They
	do their handstands against the wall, on either side of the
	front door.SALLYNo luck.JOEOh, well, we'll just have to try again.
		Sound like a plan?

	Sally nods, she and Joe, at Steven's instructions, come out
	of their handstands and lie on the floor in a stretched
	relax, facing one another.SALLYHappy anniversary, baby.JOEHappy anniversary.

	They smile.STEVENAnd change sides...

	America slides open the dining room doors.  The dining table
	is covered with bundles of freshly cut flowers.  Rosa is
	singing in Spanish.AMERICA(with the authority of long
			 years of service)
		Mr. Joe, we have to have the house.  If
		you please now...JOEIt's yours.

	The CAMERA glances off photos of the couple: portraits and
	candids, their wedding day, with friends, on vacation,
	tumbling on the lawn, and the like.
	Some framed and hung, some taped to the fridge or simply
	leaning on a shelf.  It's clear that at least a handful are
	by the same photographer, black and whites, grainy and
	beautiful.

	There are lots of photos of Joe and his sister Lucy,
	documenting their relationship from childhood.  There's an
	ANNIE LEIBOWITZ photo-shoot of Sally carelessly displayed
	somewhere.INT. BEDROOM - LATERJoe stands behind Sally in front of the full length mirror,
	his arms around her, stroking her belly.JOEI love you.  Most beautiful woman in the
		world.SALLYHardly...JOEAccept a compliment.SALLYI think you're the most beautiful woman
		in the world.

	They move toward the bed.JOEWhat did you get me?SALLYIn the morning, after everyone's gone and
		there's just us.

	She pushes him on the bed.JOEKiss my eyes.

	She does.SALLYMy wrists.

	He does.JOEKiss the back of my knees.SALLYThrough the sweats or not?JOENot.

	She pulls down his sweats.  She kisses the back of his knees.
	He turns, stares up at her.SALLYWhat?JOEYou didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did
		you?

	Sally shakes her head.SALLYNo.  Did you?JOE(after a beat)
		No.  I missed that.SALLYI missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't
		we?JOEWe're great.SALLYI mean, you're really back.JOEFor good.

	They begin to make love...the phone RINGS.JOE (CONT'D)Don't get it.SALLYWell, it might be Clair.  They're
		threatening not to come...JOEWhat?SALLYThey can't find a sitter...
			(into the receiver)
		Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.
			(she looks at Joe)
		Just a moment.
			(puts the call on hold)
		It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions
		to the house.  You invited Skye fucking
		Davidson to our anniversary party?JOEOkay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell
		you.  It was the only chance I had to
		meet her.SALLYYou invited her to our anniversary party?
		I didn't even invite my mother.JOEShe goes on location tomorrow.  Sally,
		I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on
		hold.SALLY(pissed)
		No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking
		Davidson, for fuck's sake.JOE(regards her)
		You want me to uninvite her?SALLYNo, no of course not.  How old is she?
		Twenty-fucking-two?

	She gets out of bed, starts into the bathroom.  The CAMERA is
	with her.SALLY (CONT'D)(into the bathroom mirror)
		And she's a stinking fucking actress, for
		fuck's sake.JOE(into the receiver)
		Skye!
			(his face lights)
		I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's
		our sixth, actually.
			(flattered)
		You read the book again?  Well, no, the
		ending to chapter six...it's just that
		it's not filmic.
		We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it
		just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can
		absolutely look at that again.  If you're
		coming from Laurel, you want to take
		Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers
		State Park.  Three blocks west of that,
		you want to hang right.  It's about three
		quarters of a mile up a big white thing
		on the left.

	Sally's started the bath, and is watching him from the
	doorway.  He meets her eyes mid-sentence.JOE (CONT'D)Oh?  I don't think tonight.  I'm sure
		they're well behaved.  All our friends
		have dogs, and they always want to bring
		them.  We'd be outnumbered, you see?  So
		we sort of put a ban on it.  Sorry.

	He rolls his eyes.  Sally walks back into the bathroom, she
	isn't buying it.JOE (O.S.) (CONT'D)I'm looking forward to meeting you, too.
		And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're
		willing to take this leap with me.
		Eternally grateful, really.SALLY(into the bathroom mirror)
		I'm going to throw up.JOE (O.S.)I can't imagine anyone else playing
		Genna.SALLY(sanguine)
		Really?INT. BEDROOM - LATERThe doorbell rings.  There are two closed doors on either
	side of the room.  The bed shows no sign of consummated sex.
	Joe comes through the left hand door, nearly dressed.JOEWho the fuck can be here at this time?
		It's not even seven!

	Sally comes through the other door, one shoe off, one on.SALLYOh Jesus, who else is always early for
		Christ's sake?NEW ANGLESally kisses his cheek on her way to the door.SALLY (CONT'D)Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.JOEI'll say as little as possible.

	Sally exits the bedroom.HOLD ON JOEFor a moment, then Sally re-enters, kisses him deeply.SALLYI love you.INT. FOYER - EARLY EVENINGThe house is filled with exquisite flower arrangements,
	candles everywhere.

	JERRY and JUDY ADAMS are on the porch, just beyond the glass
	of the front door.  Their argument is inaudible.  They're in
	their mid-thirties, conservatively dressed.  She's stunning,
	genetically nervous.  Jerry carries a briefcase.  She's got
	the gift.

	Sally opens the door.  Hugs and buses them, hello.JUDYI know we're early, we're so early.
		Sorry.JERRYYou have to sign your taxes anyway.SALLY(a grin)
		Of course we do.

		ago, who would have thunk it?

	Jerry hugs Joe.JOE(sotto)
		Well, not me, to be honest.JERRY(sotto)
		Don't fuck up again.  It's got a ripple
		effect.  Sally suffers, we all suffer.JUDY(offers)
		We have a gift?JOEThanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?JUDYLovely.

	Joe moves toward the kitchen.JERRY(a moment, to Sally)
		We closed.SALLYFantastic.
			(takes his hand)
		Out here.

	They step out onto the porch.  Judy's left alone, unsure
	whether to follow or not.JUDY(finally, to no one, and to no
			 response)
		The house looks beautiful, are those
		hydrangeas?

	She stands awkwardly in the middle of the foyer.EXT. PORCH - CONTINUOUSJERRYJoe officially owns No. 4, Cheyenne Walk,
		Chelsea, London, England.  No small
		doing.SALLYI love you, you're a genius.

	Behind them, in the foyer, Judy wanders aimlessly.JERRYI suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift.
		I'm not sure it's in your best interest.SALLYI adore him.JERRYThe realtor'll be here tomorrow in the
		morning.  The house had to go on the
		market to insure the loan on the London
		flat.SALLYI know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.JERRYWhat you earn has to double in order to
		cover expenses in London, it's an
		outrageously expensive city.SALLYWe've only been over this how many times?JERRYYou only made half your quote this year.SALLYWell, you're a tower of support.JERRYI worry because you don't.  It's my job.
		I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it
		if you waited until the two of you were
		on more solid ground.SALLY(direct, simple)
		We couldn't be on more solid ground.JERRYWhatever you say.  Listen, I love you.

	Otis is barking.JOE (O.S.)Otis!  No barking!SALLY(touched)
		And Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a
		rock star in London.  His novels sell
		millions.JERRYNot millions.SALLYHe's directing now.JERRYThey're paying him scale.

	The CAMERA catches sight of Joe behind them.  He moves
	through the foyer and into the living room with a tray of
	glasses and Judy in tow.SALLYHe gets huge advances on his novels.
		He's going back to that.  You know how he
		hates it here.JERRYThere's still time to undo this.SALLY(kisses his cheek)
		We'll be fine.JERRY(re: barking dog)
		Did you invite them?SALLYThe Roses?  And of course they said yes.JERRYThat was the plan.  And you're thrilled
		to have them.SALLYWhatever you say.JERRYDid you tell Joe to behave?SALLYYes.JERRYDid he promise?SALLYScout's honor.JERRYBefore I forget.

		us to do?JERRYBeats a lawsuit.INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUSJoe and Judy sit on opposite sides of the sofa -- slightly
	uncomfortable with each other.JOE(to fill the silence,
			 conspiratorial grin)
		I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?JUDY(chokes on the champagne)
		Nothing that can't be exchanged.JOEOh.  Well.  Good.JUDYCongratulations on the deal.  How
		exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean
		it's Sally.  The character that's based
		on Sally.  The character that's based on
		Sally in the book.JOEThe novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing
		the lead.JUDYOh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan.
		She's very beautiful.JOEYes, she is.JUDY(trying harder)
		But I am right, yes?  She's based on
		Sally.JOEIt's a novel.JUDYStill.  Well.  Let's drop it.JOEYes.JUDYI'm not much of a reader, but I do love
		autobiographies, even biographies
		sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you
		read the new Styron?JOENo.JUDYIt's very good.
			(a moment)
		I understand you won the Booker Prize.JOEYes I did.JUDY(another moment)
		Is your script much like the novel?
		Jerry says it's very good.  But you know,
		you read the novel, and then you see the
		movie - and most of the time you say,
		"what's this?" You know?  I sometimes
		think we're better off not reading the
		novel at all.  Because, we come with
		expectations... and of course, we know
		where we're going.  Don't you find?JOEDon't I find what?JUDYI don't know why Joe, we've known each
		other how long...JOENot long.JUDY(benign)

		started to say Joe that --JOEDo I put you off?JUDYYou manage to throw me off balance.  I
		adore you.JOEAnd I you.JUDYBut I'm always afraid I'll say something
		stupid.JOEAh.JUDYAnd so I always manage to, do you see?
		Like the book/script thing, do you see?JOEMmm hmmm.INT. FOYERCAL and SOPHIA GOLD are there with their children - JACK and

	Joe goes off with the children to find Otis.  Cal sits at the
	piano, plays.INT. FOYER - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUSJoe holds Evie in one arm.  Jack stands beside him, holds his
	hand.  MONICA and RYAN ROSE face him across the threshold --
	the NEXT DOOR NEIGHBORS.  She's in her late twenties - and
	beautiful, eyes everywhere - star struck and house struck.
	Ryan is somewhat older, a little awkward in company,
	swallowing resentment and a little self righteous.JOEWell, hello you two.
			(putting Evie down; to Jack)
		These are the people who live next door.
		Say hello.

	Jack does.JOE (CONT'D)And close the door, Jack.  Because if we

		know what will happen then?JACKUh, uh.JOEHe'll run next door into their backyard
		and he'll bark and bark and bark and eat
		their pitbull for his dinner.  Is it a
		pitbull?RYAN(not amused)
		No, actually.JOE(to Jack)
		Oh whatever.  We don't want that to

		to talk about the dog thing?MONICAPlease, Ryan.JOE(kisses her cheek and shakes
			 his hand)
		No, he's absolutely right.  You're
		absolutely right, Ryan.  Dog talk must be
		banned.  Canine conversations are
		completely discouraged... it's really
		good of you to join us.  Can I get you a

	An awkward moment.MONICA(checks with Ryan)

	Joe slips the coke into Monica's hand.SALLY (CONT'D)(takes the gift)

		fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.SALLYYou're keeping a record, are you?RYANIt's just very distracting when you're
		trying to work.MONICARyan.RYAN(to Joe)
		I'm sure you understand.SALLYWell the neighborhood is full of dogs,

		Sheila will defend herself.MONICARyan!SALLY(cuts off response from Joe; to
			 Ryan)
		Are you working on a new book?RYAN(caught short; flattered)

			(she reacts to Mac)
		The gate was open?JOEIt's taken care of.MONICAI think Ryan needs a new publisher.  I

	Several of the other guests greet her, Mac among them.TIGHT CLOSEJoe sweeps her up to his arms.  It's an intimate,
