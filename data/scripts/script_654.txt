KILLING ZOEWritten by

                               Roger AvaryFADE IN:INT. TAXI CAB - MOVING - DAYRain falls on the rear window of a taxi parked in the taxi 
       zone of the Charles de Gualle Airport.

       Aside from the incessant tapping of rain on the roof of the 
       cab  we hear the sounds of the airport:  the almost monotonic 
       loudspeaker declaring in French that loitering is not 
       permissible and that should any bags be left unattended that 
       they will be destroyed; the honking of the horns from other 
       automobiles; the unintelligible chatter of people as they get 
       their bearings.  Inside the cab, playing on the radio, is 
       Angelique Kidjo's funky song "Batonga".

       Then, the rear door to the cab opens and in an EXTREME CLOSE 
       UP we see ZED, a young man with wild, almost mesmerizing eyes 
       shielded by small round glasses, and with a head of nappy red 
       hair.  His face has drops on it from the flurry outside.

       He settles himself, then looks to the CAB DRIVER, an easy 
       going Senegalese/Frenchman, in the front seat.ZEDHotel Mondial.CAB DRIVERLe Mondial.  Tres bien.

       He starts driving.CAB DRIVERAvec cette pluie ca risque de prendre un 
                 moment.  L'autoroute est ferme.  A cause 
                 du 14 Juillet.

       He drives for a while.CAB DRIVER[Do you mind the radio?]

       Zed looks at the meter, francs are clicking away.  He also 
       looks at the cab driver's license, his name is Moises Du 
       Bois.CAB DRIVER[Do you want me to turn the radio off?]ZED(realizing he's being asked a 
                      question)
                 I don't speak French.

       The driver turns around.CAB DRIVER(in broken English)
                 Ah.  American?ZEDThat's right.CAB DRIVERThat's good because I speak a little 
                 English.

       Zed nods.CAB DRIVERI asked if you mind the radio.  Music.  
                 You know.

       Zed shakes his head "no".CAB DRIVER(with a smile)
                 Super cool.

       Zed adjusts his watch.ZEDWhat time is it?CAB DRIVERTime, time, time.  I don't know.  
                 Daytime.

       Zed forgets the adjustment for now.CAB DRIVERAre you in town for business?ZEDYes.CAB DRIVERIt's a nice hotel.  Your hotel.  Very big 
                 rooms.

       He looks at Zed in the rear view mirror.CAB DRIVERDo you know Paris?ZEDI've been here once before.  When I was 
                 younger.

       The cab driver smiles.CAB DRIVERThose were the days.

       They drive for a while.CAB DRIVERMarried?ZEDI beg your pardon?CAB DRIVERDo you have a wife?ZEDNo.
                     (then after thinking about it 
                      for a while)
                 Why?CAB DRIVERWell, if you need a wife for the night...
                     (searching for the right words 
                      in French)
                 Une escorte.  Pour vous faire visiter.
                     (then back to his broken 
                      English)
                 For business.  I give you my number.  
                 Very nice girl.  French.  Like when you 
                 were young.

       He lifts his hand and shows his index and middle finger 
       tightly extended together, then he crosses them.CAB DRIVERKnow what I mean?

       Zed smiles at this and nods.CAB DRIVERSpeaks the language of love.  Take you to 
                 heaven and back.  You just tell me and I 
                 set it up.

       Zed shakes his head and laughs.CAB DRIVERWhat you laughing at?  You let Moises set 
                 it up.  She treat you right.  She treat 
                 you fine.

       Zed can do nothing but smile at the thought of it.DISSOLVE TO:INT. HOTEL - HALL - DAYA long, empty hallway of a moderately priced hotel.  From 
       around a corner comes a BELLBOY carrying Zed's one bag.

       Zed is right behind him.

       They come up to room 6A and the bellboy unlocks the door.INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAYThe door to the room opens and the bellboy, followed by Zed, 
       walks into the room.

       He puts Zed's bag onto one of those luggage holders and 
       proceeds to show him the room.

       Sitting on the bed is a large air freight package.BELLBOY(in broken English)
                 Your package...It arrived in the last 
                 night of before last night.

       He points to the telephone.BELLBOYAh...telephone, for the room service.

       He motions toward the bathroom.BELLBOYThe toilet.

       He opens the closet door.BELLBOYTo hang the clothes.

       He points to a control console next to the bed.BELLBOYFrom here you can operate the television.

       Then he pauses at the door before he goes out.

       Zed reaches into his pocket and takes out some French money, 
       he starts fingering through it.

       Then, the bellboy takes the liberty of showing Zed which 
       bills to give him.BELLBOY(after getting what he wanted)
                 Merci.

       He starts to leave.ZEDOh, wait.

       The bellboy turns around.ZEDWhat time is it?BELLBOY(confused)
                 What time is it?ZED(pointing at his watch)
                 Time.BELLBOYAh.  Yes.  Il est presque huit heures 
                 moins dix.

       The bellboy clicks his heels and walks out the door.

       Zed looks around the room, still wondering what time it is, 
       and takes a seat on the bed.

       Obviously tired from the flight Zed unbuttons his shirt a bit 
       and lays back on the bed next to the package.  Before he 
       dozes off to sleep he takes his watch off and places it on 
       the bedside table.

       He is asleep.FADE TO BLACK:INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER - DAYZed's bed, while still made, looks like it's been slept in.  
       Sitting on it is the ripped open air freight package.  Inside 
       of it is a black steel briefcase.

       The shower is on and from the look of things Zed is in it.

       On the bedside table we see Zed's watch.  It reads 12:10 P.M.  
       Next to it is the phone.  Next to the phone is a piece of 
       folded paper with Moises' name and a phone number that reads:45.63.53.37.INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - SHOWER - DAYZed is in the shower letting the water run directly into his 
       face and cascade down his body.

       He opens his mouth and freely drinks the water, then he spits 
       some out with a spurt.

       Then he stops, attentive, listening for something.

       He turns the shower off.

       Then he hears it again, the knocking on the door.INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - DAYZed grabs a towel and climbs out of the shower.  He makes his 
       way toward the knocking.INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAYZed walks to the door to his room with the towel wrapped 
       around his waist.  He opens it.

       In the hall is ZOEY, a cute French girl of not more than 
       twenty.  She's chewing on gum the way a schoolgirl might, but 
       she looks like no girl Zed ever went to school with.ZOEYBonjour.ZED(a little awkwardly)
                 Bonjour.

       Zed opens up the door and lets her in.  She checks out the 
       room and places her bag on the bed.  Then she makes her way 
       to the window for a view of the city.ZOEYWow.  Vous avez une belle chambre.  Je ne 
                 suis jamais venue dans cet hotel.

       She turns to him, but in the process takes the time to 
       examine every detail of the room.ZOEYCa sera 150 francs de l'heure.  Toute la 
                 nuit pour 700.  D'avance.  Et faudra 
                 porter un--ZEDI...don't speak French.

       She blows a bubble.ZOEYIt's okay.

       She takes a seat on the bed.ZOEYIt will be one thousand francs for all 
                 night.  In advance.

       Zed takes the money out of his wallet and gives it to her.ZOEYWe can do it now if you want.ZEDWell, let me just dry up.ZOEYOkay, but it's not necessary.

       He goes into the bathroom and starts drying himself.

       She puts the money in her bag and then turns on the 
       television from the remote console.  A French talk show comes 
       on.  She changes the channel until she comes to a station 
       playing F.W. Murnau's silent classic, "Nosferatu".  She 
       smiles and sits back to watch.ZED(O.S.)(from the bathroom)
                 What's your name?ZOEYZoe or Zoey.  Which ever you like.ZED(O.S.)My name's Zed.ZOEY(smiling at this)
                 That's funny.  We both have Z names.

       Zed comes walking out of the bathroom drying his hair.  His 
       pants are on.ZEDWhat was that?

       She notices his pants.ZOEYYou can take those off.  The pants.ZEDI'd rather watch you get undressed first.ZOEY(matter-of-factly)
                 Alright.

       She stands up and starts to lift her top off.  He stops her.ZEDSlower.

       He lays down on the bed.

       She stands there looking at him and then smiles.ZOEYAlright Mister America.  Zed.

       Then, with Zed laying on the bed and watching her, she 
       slowly, seductively strips in front of him, never taking her 
       eyes from his eyes, until she is totally naked.ZOEYSlow enough for you?

       Then, like a cat prowling for it's prey, she crawls over the 
       bed to him and begins to unbuckle his pants.

       She removes the pants and climbs on top of him.  They begin 
       to make love.

       On the television, "Nosferatu" silently plays.

       Zoey and Zed quicken their pace with an urgency one can't 
       resist during a moment of passion.

       She cries out and lowers herself to his grasp.  An IMAGE 
       overcomes her mind.

       They quicken to an almost violent speed and then expire, both 
       satisfied.

       She begins to kiss him multiple times over the face.ZOEYC'etait formidable.

       She rolls over, still hugging him, purring like a kitten.

       They rest there for a while...holding each other.ZOEYI'm cold.

       She takes the covers and crawls under them, so does Zed.ZOEYZed?ZEDYes?ZOEYMoises told me you were in town for 
                 business.ZEDYes.ZOEYWhat kind of business?ZEDWhy?ZOEYI don't know.  I'm just curious.ZEDDo you ask all your clients questions?ZOEYNo.  Just the ones I like.ZEDSo you like me?ZOEYYes.ZEDWhy?ZOEYBecause you're...a good person.  I run 
                 into some real creeps.  You know.ZEDHow do you know I'm a good person?ZOEYBody language.  We fit together.ZEDAll men and women fit together.  Hell, 
                 even some men fit together.ZOEYNo, but you know, we clicked.  You made 
                 me orgasm.  Do you know how often I 
                 orgasm with a man Moises sets me up with?ZEDNo I don't.ZOEYUsually never.  They're almost always fat 
                 like pigs.

       Zed laughs at this.ZOEYAnd you make me feel safe.  That's 
                 something more important than the orgasm.  
                 An integral part maybe of the orgasm.ZEDI never really thought of it like that.ZOEYWell, it's true.

       Zed nods at this.ZOEYTurn off the television.

       Zed reaches over and turns it off from the console.ZOEYSo I mean it when I tell you Zed, I like 
                 you very much.ZEDWell, I like you too Zoe.ZOEYHonest?

       He nods.ZOEYWhy?  For the same reason?  Any man can 
                 orgasm.  Even with his own hand.

       Zed stares ahead as he thinks of an answer.ZEDWell, I like your honesty.  You're open.  
                 Unlike most prostitutes I've been with.

       She doesn't like the sound of this.  She slaps him.ZOEYI am not a prostitute!

       Zed is a little surprised at this.ZEDReally?  Can I have my francs back then?ZOEYI'm a student.  And to pay for the 
                 classes I became an escort.  It's my 
                 choice to sleep with you.ZEDI see.ZOEYWhat?  You don't understand.ZEDNo, I do.ZOEYHey, it's not easy.ZEDI didn't say it was.ZOEYI'm here because I want to.ZEDOkay, okay relax.  What school do you go 
                 to?ZOEYThe Centre du Art, Paris.ZEDThat's really interesting.  What kind of 
                 art do you study?ZOEYNot any of the old shit.ZEDOh.ZOEYI have a day job too.  Three times a 
                 week.

       She rolls onto her back and stares into an imaginary world as 
       she talks to Zed.ZOEYBut someday there will be only my art.ZEDWhat kind of things do you paint?ZOEYI don't paint.  I make things.  Objects.  
                 Not like sculpture.  Like life...but with 
                 no narrative.  I want when someone looks 
                 at one of my objects for there to be no 
                 reference to the world.  Void of feeling, 
                 emotion...void of destiny.  Those are 
                 left for me.  They belong only to me.  If 
                 someone else can see into it...then it is 
                 no longer mine.  I have failed.  And I 
                 would destroy it.  I don't care how much 
                 cash they would offer me.  It would be 
                 shit.  I can't tell you how many objects 
                 of mine have been destroyed.  They told 
                 too much about me.  And if someone wants 
                 to know something about me...I'll tell 
                 them myself.  The way I'm telling you.

       She looks back at him.ZOEYWhat I do I do only for the objects.ZEDI'd like to see one of these.ZOEYWhat?  So you could see the work of a 
                 whore?

       He decides to put a stop to this once and for all.ZEDZoey.  I'm sorry for calling you a 
                 prostitute.  I didn't understand the 
                 difference.ZOEYThe difference is a prostitute would have 
                 lied to you about her orgasm.

       He gives her a kiss.ZEDIf these things you make are as true as 
                 you are...I'm sure they're as 
                 indescribable.  Perhaps, someday, you'll 
                 make one...about me.ZOEYIf I do...you'll never know which one it 
                 is.  Because I'll be the only one who 
                 understands.  I'll be the only one who 
                 can look into it and see where in my life 
                 it came from.

       Zed is unable to speak.  They look into each others eyes for 
       a long moment, hearing the sounds of the city drift in 
       through the window.  Then she leans forward and gives him a 
       soft understanding kiss.DISSOLVE TO:INT. ZED'S ROOM - NIGHTZed is asleep.  Zoey is asleep in his arms.

       There is a knocking at the door.

       Zed opens his eyes.

       The knock becomes a pound.

       Zed gets up and puts on his pants.  Zoey gets up and looks 
       around.ZOEY(groggily)
                 What time is it?ZEDI have no idea.  Night time.

       There is more pounding on the door.ZOEYI'm going to take a shower.

       She trots off naked to the bathroom and starts the shower.

       Zed walks over to the door and opens it up.

       Standing in the hall is Eric, a Frenchman of Zed's age 
       wearing baggy French-style clothes.ERIC(with a thick accent)
                 Hey you madman!

       Zed's happy to see him.ZEDEric.  Come in.

       They hug.ERICWhat happened to you?  I thought you were 
                 going to call.

       Eric walks in and starts to notice the traces of wild love 
       making around the room.ERIC(smiling)
                 Oh I see.  You have been busy.ZEDSorry, I asked the hotel to give me a 
                 wake up call.ERICThat's good, but now I am here.  So let's 
                 go.  We have a lot to talk about.ZEDWhat about the girl?ERICIs she your girlfriend?ZEDNo.ERICFuck her.

       He peeks into the bathroom.ERICShe's a dishrag whore.  Kick her out.ZEDI'll let her stay here tonight.ERICDon't be silly.  It's dangerous.

       Eric walks into the bathroom.INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHTEric walks up to the shower and knocks on the door.  Zoey is

                 for you to leave.]ZOEY[Fuck you.]

       Eric opens up the door and yanks her out of the shower.ERIC[No.  Come on you fucking slut!]

       She shrieks.ZOEY[Let go of me you shit!!]

       He kicks her in the butt and sends her toward the door.ERIC[Get the fuck out of here you fucking

       He opens the door and throws her into the hall.INT. HOTEL - HALL - NIGHTNaked, Zoey falls into the hall.

       Eric slams the door shut.

       Eric listens.ERICOh shit.  Her clothes.

       He picks up her clothes and her bag, opens the door, and 
       throws it into the hall just long enough for her to yell at 
       him.ZOEY(almost too quick to 
                      understand)

       He slams the door shut.

       Then he turns to Zed.ERICSo tell me, what have you been up to?

       Zed sits down on the bed.ZOEY(O.S.)Allez vous faire enculer tous le deux!ZEDEric, I liked that girl.ERICOh.  Well, then why didn't you stop me.ZEDBecause you were on a rampage.ERICLook, your whole life you've done nothing 
                 but fuck whores.  A girl like that will 
                 give you AIDS.  Why don't you find a nice 
                 girl in the suburbs?ZEDBecause when you need to get off you 
                 don't want to have to date for months to

                 much happening for me in the states.ERICBut in Paris your old friend Eric has a 
                 job for you, so you came.  That's good.ZEDHow could I resist your invitation?ERICYou would have been stupid to.ZEDSo what have you been doing here?ERICAfter school I spent some time in Algeria 
                 studying African philosophy.  And then I 
                 bummed around.  You know.  For fun.  For 
                 a while I worked at Le Figaro.  The 
                 newspaper.ZEDReally?ERICYes.  With an assumed Masters degree.  
                 And lately we have just been bombing 
                 fascists here in Paris.  You know, like 
                 terrorists.

       Zed looks over at him.ERICIt's fun.CUT TO:INT. ERIC'S FLAT - OUTER STAIRWELL - NIGHTEric and Zed walk up the stairs to the fifth floor where 
       Eric's flat is.  On the top landing there is a dead cat 
       laying.  Zed and Eric notice the cat as Eric is opening the 
       door.

       There is also a telephone coming out of the neighbors door.ERICThe people next door are on holiday.  We 
                 took their phone.  If you want to make a 
                 long distance call, go ahead.ZEDIs that cat dead?ERICI don't know.  I think it's asleep but 
                 it's been there for days.

       Eric gives it a kick.  No response.ERICI guess it is dead.

       They walk into the flat.INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHTEric's flat consists of a good sized living room area with a 
       connected kitchen and a small bedroom in the back.  In the 
       front of the living room there is a small balcony where the 
       sounds of the city pour in.  The room itself is a general 
       mess.  A bunch of guns are piled in one corner of the floor.  
       Hung up on the wall is a huge, French "Dressed To Kill" 
       poster.

       Some Brazilian Gilberto/Getz music is playing.

       Sitting at the table playing cards are three men:  FRANCOIS, 
       RICARDO, and JEAN.

       Sitting on the couch rolling a cigarette with hash is CLAUDE 
       and OLIVER.

       They all turn as Zed and Eric walk in.ERICHello.

       They all return the greeting.ERIC(to Zed)
                 Okay.  This is Francois, Ricardo, Jean, 
                 Oliver, and Claude.  Got it?ZEDI will.ERICThey all know who you are.
                     (to the rest of them)
                 Ne soyez pa salauds.  Offrez une biere au 
                 plus grand perceur de coffres.

       Oliver stands up and walks to the kitchen.OLIVER(with an English accent)
                 Zed, would you like a beer?ZEDThanks.OLIVERDon't think of it.CLAUDE(to Zed)
                 Come.  Sit down.INT. ERIC'S FLAT - KITCHEN - NIGHTThe kitchen is an absolute pig stye.  Dishes are piled up in 
       the sink and on the counter.

       Oliver grabs a glass that has some old beer in it and empties 
       it.  He scratches some filth off of it and pours some beer 
       into the glass.INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHTZed takes a seat on the couch next to Claude.

       Suddenly, a SPIDER MONKEY dressed in a little Uncle Sam 
       costume comes screeching up onto Zed's lap and then up onto 
       his head, the whole time clawing at his eyes.

       Eric, amused, turns from the men playing cards and smiles.CLAUDE(to Zed)
                 Easy.  Don't scare him.  He just wants to 
                 claim you.

       Zed is frozen as the monkey climbs around him and then onto 
       Claude's shoulder.CLAUDELet me introduce you properly.  This is 
                 Enrique.

       The monkey screeches.CLAUDEHe likes to be called Chim Chim, but we 
                 don't always get what we like...do we?

       Again, the hideous creature screeches.CLAUDE(to Enrique)

                     (then to Zed)
                 Do you like hash?

       Then Eric interrupts.ERIC(jokingly)
                 Don't sit next to that junkie.CLAUDEAhhhhhh!

       Claude throws a lit cigarette at him which explodes into a 
       mass of sparks.  They laugh.ERIC(to Claude)
                 That little shit monkey of yours pissed 
                 on my Billy Holiday albums.  Next time 
                 he's out the door.
                     (to Zed)
                 Zed, come here.

       Zed gets up and goes with Eric to the bedroom.  On the way 
       Oliver hands him the glass of beer.OLIVERHere you go mate.ZEDThanks.

       Oliver sits down next to Claude.INT. ERIC'S FLAT - BEDROOM - NIGHTEric's bed has probably never been made.  In fact, this room 
       looks a lot like Quentin Tarantino's old apartment.  But, 
       there is a certain order to all this chaos.  Eric pulls out a 
       blueprint and spreads it out over the bed.ERICDon't ask me where we got this.ZEDOkay.ERICOn Bastille Day, all the banks are 
                 closed.

       He places his hand on the blueprint.ERICBut this one.  BIP.  The Banque 
                 Internationale de Paris.  And for being 
                 greedy capitalists perhaps they will 
                 remain closed next Bastille day.  Yes?

       Zed smiles.ERICWe will go in and shut the bank down.  
                 Now, look at this.

       Eric pulls out a complex electronic schematic.ERICAs you can see, only one person can start 
                 the alarm.
                     (he hands it to Zed)
                 The concierge, at this desk.

                      blueprint)
                 We will take care of him.  Then we can 
                 close the bank.  No one will know the 
                 difference since every other bank will be 
                 closed.ZED(turning the schematic around)
                 Are you sure he won't push the alarm?ERICAhhh!  He's right next to the door.  We'd 
                 have to be totally incompetent not to 
                 stop him.  Don't worry about that.

       He points to the main floor vault.ERICHere.  This is where they keep the days 
                 reserve cash.  Okay fuck that.

       He flips the page to the lower level blueprint.ERICThere are many vaults downstairs, but 
                 this is the vault we must get into.  This 
                 is where the real prize is.ZEDWhat kind of vault is that?

       He checks the blueprint.ERICAh...Swiss made.  A Caliber.ZEDCaliber?
                     (he thinks about it)
                 It'll take three hours.ERICNo, that's too long.ZEDThat's how long it'll take.ERICWell shit.  It's too long.  We have to be 
                 in and out.
                     (he snaps his fingers)
                 Like that.  Or there will be suspicion.  
                 A little time is okay...but too long 
                 and...

       He shrugs his shoulders in an "I don't know gesture."ZEDWell hold on a second.
                     (pointing to the blueprint)
                 What's this?

       Eric looks down at the blueprint.  There is a small passage 
       connecting the main vault to an adjacent vault.ERICAnother vault.ZEDNo this.

       Eric looks closely at the blueprint.ERICI don't know...it connects the two 
                 vaults.ZEDWell, what kind of vault is this other 
                 one?ERIC(reading the blueprint)
                 Also Swiss, but this one is a Poseidon.ZEDWhy would those two vaults be connected?ERICI don't know.ZEDBecause I can get into this vault in half 
                 an hour.  Maybe less.ERICBut this entry way is too small to get 
                 the platen out.  We have a lot of 
                 merchandise in there.ZEDNo, don't you see?  We get in through 
                 this secondary vault and take this 
                 passage to the other main vault.  From 
                 the inside I could open the Caliber vault 
                 in five minutes.ERICYou could open it in five minutes?ZEDFrom the inside it's easy.ERIC(excited)
                 Hot damn.  That is our answer.ZEDOkay.  When is Bastille day?ERICTomorrow.ZEDTomorrow!?  We're doing this tomorrow?ERICBut of course.ZEDIt's impossible.ERICIt's not impossible.  Everyone knows what 
                 to do.ZEDI don't know what to do.ERICYou don't need to know shit.  Just get 
                 into the vault and we'll do the rest.ZEDI haven't even seen the bank.ERICFuck the bank.  Before we do a job we 
                 live life.  It's better that way.  Okay?ZED(unsure)
                 Okay.ERICGood.  Now we do heroin!CUT TO:INT. ERIC'S FLAT - BATHROOM - NIGHTEXTREME CLOSE ON:  Eric making heroin.

       The heroin powder is put into a spoon with some lemon 
       squeezed into it, then a little bit of tap water.  Huddled 
       around Eric are Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver.OLIVER(so high he's wobbling)
                 You have to look at the Starship 
                 Enterprise as a metaphor for the human 
                 brain.

       No one is really listening to Oliver.  Eric takes out a 
       lighter and cooks it to a boil.OLIVER(continuing)
                 Spock is the right hemisphere of the 
                 brain, all logic and intellect. Mc Coy is 
                 the left hemisphere, stricktly emotional.  
                 And Kirk is the unseen observer.  He 
                 drifts between the two.  Back and forth, 
                 as it might be, caught between the two 
                 thought processes.ERIC[Cotton.]

       Ricardo hands him a cotton ball.OLIVER(continuing)
                 It's really quite brilliant you know.  
                 That's why Star Trek is and always will 
                 be a hit show.

       Eric places the cotton ball in the spoon with the mixture.ERIC(to Oliver)
                 [Here, shut up and hold this.]

       He hands Oliver the spoon and takes out a needle.  Using the 
       cotton as a filter he draws the heroin into the syringe.

       Then, he holds the syringe up and starts tapping it.ERIC[Don't want to get air bubbles in my 
                 veins.]

       They all laugh at this.INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHTIn the meantime, Zed is sitting on the couch with Claude and 
       Jean.  Claude is rolling a hash and tobacco cigarette.  Jean 
       is chopping up some powder heroin on the glass of a small 
       picture.JEANDo you want heroin?ZEDNo, I want to be sharp for tomorrow.

       Jean and Claude laugh at this.JEANNo.  A little bit of heroin, some hash, a 
                 beer...and you're just right.

       Jean snorts a line.

       Claude offers Zed the spliff.  Zed shakes his head "no".CLAUDEOkay.JEAN(recovering from the snort)
                 That's good.

       Eric, Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver come out of the kitchen 
       laughing.

       Eric, Ricardo, and Oliver take a seat on the couch opposite 
       Zed.  Francois sits on the floor.

       Eric rolls up his sleeve.ERIC(to Ricardo in French)
                 [Hold my arm.]
                     (then to Zed)
                 My vein is like a rock.

       Ricardo takes hold of his arm and squeezes.  Eric inserts the 
       needle into his vein and draws out a little blood.  It mixes 
       with the heroin, then he pumps it in...then back into the 
       syringe, then all the way back in.

       He withdraws the needle.

       Ricardo lets go of his arm.

       Eric is in bliss.  His eyes roll back into his head.  He 
       looks like he's on the verge of falling asleep.

       Then Jean takes another snort.

       Pretty soon everyone is smoking and getting high, shooting 
       up, and drinking more beer.

       Then Jean holds out a piece of folded aluminum foil with some 
       heroin in it.JEAN(to Zed)
                 Try some.  It's called chasing the 
                 dragon.  The Chinese have been doing it 
                 for centuries.ZEDI don't think so.JEANOh, but you must.  It will make you feel 
                 as though the rest of the world is in a 
                 bubble of glass and that you're rubbing 
                 up against it like a bad windshield 
                 wiper.

       They stick the aluminum foil with the heroin in it up next to 
       his face.  They then light the bottom of the foil with a 
       lighter.  Before Zed knows it, he's inhaling a silky ribbon 
       of smoke.

       Suddenly our plane of focus wildly shifts and we...FOCUS DISSOLVE TO:INT. ERIC'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHTRicardo is racing Eric's car through the streets of Paris 
       weaving in and out of traffic.  Next to him is Oliver, and in

       stoned Zed a whirlwind tour of the sights.

       A car speeds up next to them.  In it is Francois, and Claude, 
       with Jean driving.  They are racing with Ricardo through the 
       streets.

       The Patrick Hernandez song "Born To Be Alive" is blasting 
       away on the radio.ERICThere.  That's Notre Dame.

       But before Zed can even look it has past by.RICARDODo you like French cars?

       All Zed can notice is that the speedometer is at 160

       miles per hour.ZED(answering Enrique's question)

       They take a sharp turn.CUT TO:INT. CELLAR - NIGHTEric, Zed, Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Claude, and Oliver are 
       all walking down some dank stone steps into a cellar.  
       Somewhere crazy Raymond Scott Toy Jazz music is playing.

       An old wine cellar has been converted into a Toy Jazz club.  
       Nothing fancy...dirt floors, chairs and small tables

       set up with a buffet of local cuisine on it.  Behind the 
       tables are two rotund but happy French women MIRELLE andJOSEPHINE.Eric, Zed, Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Claude, and Oliver walk 
       in and immediately start blabbing away in French to Mirelle

       Eric hands them some money.ZED'S TABLEEveryone enters and takes seats at various parts of the club.  
       Oliver sits next to Zed.OLIVERSo, how long have you known Eric?ZEDWell, Eric's mother is American.OLIVERYeah, and his dad's French.ZEDThey're divorced.  And she and his father 
                 had some kind of six month split plan set 
                 up.  So every six months he would come 
                 back to the states.  We were best 
                 friends.  Eventually he and his mother 
                 had a falling out and he stayed here.  
                 It's been...years.OLIVERWell, it's good to have you here.  Eric 
                 speaks fairly highly of you.  Say, he

                 was young.OLIVEROh they're the best.  Helmets with horns 
                 on them.  Shit.  That's fucking genius.

       He starts laughing.OLIVERHow 'bout Toy Jazz?  You like it?

       Zed watches the players on stage and then nods.ZEDYeah...I guess.OLIVERI love it.  It's really good, you know?  
                 Like real music.  It has a heart and

                 Total purity of essence.ZEDYeah.OLIVERHungry cannibals'd like it.

       Then Claude comes up to them with some glasses and a bottle 
       of red wine.CLAUDEHere, you must drink some of this wine, 
                 it's good.

       He pours Zed a glass.

       good or not.ON STAGESuddenly, it seems as though the bands music gets louder.  
       The horns really start to scream and the room becomes a

       with the other musicians and sounding pretty good.

       Eric is all smile as he plays with them.  Sweat is running 
       down his face but he's caught up in the moment.

       ELISE, a woman from the audience has jumped up onto the

       James Brown.

       Then, the music crescendos and Eric hands the trombone back 
       to a musician.

       The set is over.

       Eric skips off the stage and walks over to where Oliver, 
       Claude, and Zed are sitting.EXT. BOULEVARD SAINT MICHEL - NIGHTThe McDonalds on the corner of Boulevard Saint Michel and Rue

       Eric's car.  The grooving Ryuichi Sakamoto song "Triste" is 
       playing on the radio.ERICI'm glad you came.  How long has it been?ZEDYears.ERICIt's amazing, you know?  Here you are.  
                 One day in America.  Now here.ZEDWell, to be honest there really wasn't

                 studying African philosophy.  And then I

                 a while I worked at Le Figaro.  The 
                 newspaper.ZEDReally?ERICYes.  With an assumed Masters degree.  
                 And lately we have just been bombing

       Zed looks over at him.ERICIt's fun.CUT TO:INT. ERIC'S FLAT - OUTER STAIRWELL - NIGHTEric and Zed walk up the stairs to the fifth floor where 
       Eric's flat is.  On the top landing there is a dead cat 
       laying.  Zed and Eric notice the cat as Eric is opening the 
       door.

       There is also a telephone coming out of the neighbors door.ERICThe people next door are on holiday.  We 
                 took their phone.  If you want to make a 
                 long distance call, go ahead.ZEDIs that cat dead?ERICI don't know.  I think it's asleep but 
                 it's been there for days.

       Eric gives it a kick.  No response.ERICI guess it is dead.

       They walk into the flat.INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHTEric's flat consists of a good sized living room area with a 
       connected kitchen and a small bedroom in the back.  In the 
       front of the living room there is a small balcony where the 
       sounds of the city pour in.  The room itself is a general 
       mess.  A bunch of guns are piled in one corner of the floor.  
       Hung up on the wall is a huge, French "Dressed To Kill" 
       poster.

       Some Brazilian Gilberto/Getz music is playing.

       Sitting at the table playing cards are three men:  FRANCOIS, 
       RICARDO, and JEAN.

       Sitting on the couch rolling a cigarette with hash is CLAUDE 
       and OLIVER.

       They all turn as Zed and Eric walk in.ERICHello.

       They all return the greeting.ERIC(to Zed)
                 Okay.  This is Francois, Ricardo, Jean, 
                 Oliver, and Claude.  Got it?ZEDI will.ERICThey all know who you are.

       the sink and on the counter.

       Oliver grabs a glass that has some old beer in it and empties 
       it.  He scratches some filth off of it and pours some beer 
       into the glass.INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHTZed takes a seat on the couch next to Claude.

       Suddenly, a SPIDER MONKEY dressed in a little Uncle Sam 
       costume comes screeching up onto Zed's lap and then up onto 
       his head, the whole time clawing at his eyes.

       Eric, amused, turns from the men playing cards and smiles.CLAUDE(to Zed)
                 Easy.  Don't scare him.  He just wants to 
                 claim you.

       Zed is frozen as the monkey climbs around him and then onto 
       Claude's shoulder.CLAUDELet me introduce you properly.  This is 
                 Enrique.

       The monkey screeches.CLAUDEHe likes to be called Chim Chim, but we

       Then Eric interrupts.ERIC(jokingly)

       Claude throws a lit cigarette at him which explodes into a 
       mass of sparks.  They laugh.ERIC(to Claude)

       Zed gets up and goes with Eric to the bedroom.  On the way 
       Oliver hands him the glass of beer.OLIVERHere you go mate.ZEDThanks.

       Oliver sits down next to Claude.INT. ERIC'S FLAT - BEDROOM - NIGHTEric's bed has probably never been made.  In fact, this room 
       looks a lot like Quentin Tarantino's old apartment.  But, 
       there is a certain order to all this chaos.  Eric pulls out a 
       blueprint and spreads it out over the bed.ERICDon't ask me where we got this.ZEDOkay.ERICOn Bastille Day, all the banks are 
                 closed.

       He places his hand on the blueprint.ERICBut this one.  BIP.  The Banque 
                 Internationale de Paris.  And for being 
                 greedy capitalists perhaps they will 
                 remain closed next Bastille day.  Yes?

       Zed smiles.ERICWe will go in and shut the bank down.  
                 Now, look at this.

       Eric pulls out a complex electronic schematic.ERICAs you can see, only one person can start 
                 the alarm.

                 We will take care of him.  Then we can 
                 close the bank.  No one will know the 
                 difference since every other bank will be 
                 closed.ZED(turning the schematic around)
                 Are you sure he won't push the alarm?ERICAhhh!  He's right next to the door.  We'd 
                 have to be totally incompetent not to 
                 stop him.  Don't worry about that.

       He points to the main floor vault.ERICHere.  This is where they keep the days 
                 reserve cash.  Okay fuck that.

       He flips the page to the lower level blueprint.ERICThere are many vaults downstairs, but 
                 this is the vault we must get into.  This 
                 is where the real prize is.ZEDWhat kind of vault is that?

       He checks the blueprint.ERICAh...Swiss made.  A Caliber.ZEDCaliber?
                     (he thinks about it)
                 It'll take three hours.ERICNo, that's too long.ZEDThat's how long it'll take.ERICWell shit.  It's too long.  We have to be

                     (he snaps his fingers)
                 Like that.  Or there will be suspicion.  
                 A little time is okay...but too long

       He shrugs his shoulders in an "I don't know gesture."ZEDWell hold on a second.
                     (pointing to the blueprint)
                 What's this?

       Eric looks down at the blueprint.  There is a small passage 
       connecting the main vault to an adjacent vault.ERICAnother vault.ZEDNo this.

       Eric looks closely at the blueprint.ERICI don't know...it connects the two 
                 vaults.ZEDWell, what kind of vault is this other 
                 one?ERIC(reading the blueprint)
                 Also Swiss, but this one is a Poseidon.ZEDWhy would those two vaults be connected?ERICI don't know.ZEDBecause I can get into this vault in half 
                 an hour.  Maybe less.ERICBut this entry way is too small to get 
                 the platen out.  We have a lot of 
                 merchandise in there.ZEDNo, don't you see?  We get in through 
                 this secondary vault and take this 
                 passage to the other main vault.  From 
                 the inside I could open the Caliber vault 
                 in five minutes.ERICYou could open it in five minutes?ZEDFrom the inside it's easy.ERIC(excited)
                 Hot damn.  That is our answer.ZEDOkay.  When is Bastille day?ERICTomorrow.ZEDTomorrow!?  We're doing this tomorrow?ERICBut of course.ZEDIt's impossible.ERICIt's not impossible.  Everyone knows what 
                 to do.ZEDI don't know what to do.ERICYou don't need to know shit.  Just get 
                 into the vault and we'll do the rest.ZEDI haven't even seen the bank.ERICFuck the bank.  Before we do a job we 
                 live life.  It's better that way.  Okay?ZED(unsure)
                 Okay.ERICGood.  Now we do heroin!CUT TO:INT. ERIC'S FLAT - BATHROOM - NIGHTEXTREME CLOSE ON:  Eric making heroin.

       The heroin powder is put into a spoon with some lemon 
       squeezed into it, then a little bit of tap water.  Huddled 
       around Eric are Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver.OLIVER(so high he's wobbling)
                 You have to look at the Starship 
                 Enterprise as a metaphor for the human 
                 brain.

       No one is really listening to Oliver.  Eric takes out a 
       lighter and cooks it to a boil.OLIVER(continuing)
                 Spock is the right hemisphere of the

                 And Kirk is the unseen observer.  He 
                 drifts between the two.  Back and forth,

       Eric places the cotton ball in the spoon with the mixture.ERIC(to Oliver)
                 [Here, shut up and hold this.]

       He hands Oliver the spoon and takes out a needle.  Using the 
       cotton as a filter he draws the heroin into the syringe.

       Then, he holds the syringe up and starts tapping it.ERIC[Don't want to get air bubbles in my 
                 veins.]

       They all laugh at this.INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHTIn the meantime, Zed is sitting on the couch with Claude and 
       Jean.  Claude is rolling a hash and tobacco cigarette.  Jean 
       is chopping up some powder heroin on the glass of a small 
       picture.JEANDo you want heroin?ZEDNo, I want to be sharp for tomorrow.

       Jean and Claude laugh at this.JEANNo.  A little bit of heroin, some hash, a 
                 beer...and you're just right.

       Jean snorts a line.

       Claude offers Zed the spliff.  Zed shakes his head "no".CLAUDEOkay.JEAN(recovering from the snort)
                 That's good.

       Eric, Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver come out of the kitchen 
       laughing.

       Eric, Ricardo, and Oliver take a seat on the couch opposite 
       Zed.  Francois sits on the floor.

       Eric rolls up his sleeve.ERIC(to Ricardo in French)

                     (then to Zed)
                 My vein is like a rock.

       Ricardo takes hold of his arm and squeezes.  Eric inserts the 
       needle into his vein and draws out a little blood.  It mixes 
       with the heroin, then he pumps it in...then back into the 
       syringe, then all the way back in.

       He withdraws the needle.

       Ricardo lets go of his arm.

       Eric is in bliss.  His eyes roll back into his head.  He 
       looks like he's on the verge of falling asleep.

       Then Jean takes another snort.

       Pretty soon everyone is smoking and getting high, shooting 
       up, and drinking more beer.

       Then Jean holds out a piece of folded aluminum foil with some 
       heroin in it.JEAN(to Zed)
                 Try some.  It's called chasing the 
                 dragon.  The Chinese have been doing it 
                 for centuries.ZEDI don't think so.JEANOh, but you must.  It will make you feel 
                 as though the rest of the world is in a

                 up against it like a bad windshield 
                 wiper.

       They stick the aluminum foil with the heroin in it up next to 
       his face.  They then light the bottom of the foil with a 
       lighter.  Before Zed knows it, he's inhaling a silky ribbon 
       of smoke.
