INGLOURIOUS BASTERDSWritten byQuentin Tarantino1.EXT - DAIRY FARM- DAYThe modest dairy farm in the countryside of Nancy, France (what the
          French call cow country).
          We Read a SUBTITLE in the sky above the farm house;CHAPTER ONE"ONCE UPON A TIME IN...NAZI OCCUPIED FRANCE"This SUBTITLE disappears, and is replaced by another one;"1941One year into the German
          occupation of France".
          The farm consists of a house, small barn, and twelve cows spread
          about.
          The owner of the property, a bull of a man FRENCH FARMER, brings a axe
          up and down on A tree stump blemishing his property. However simply by
          sight, you'd never know if he's been beating at this stump for the last
          year, or just started today.JULIEOne of his three pretty teenage daughters, is hanging up laundry on
          the clothes line. As she hangs up a white bed sheet, she hears a
          noise, moving the sheet aside she see's;JULIE'S POV:A Nazi town car convertible, with two little nazi flags attached to
          the hood, a NAZI SOLDIER behind the wheel, a NAZI OFFICER alone in the
          back seat, following TWO OTHER NAZI SOLDIERS on motorcycles, coming up
          over the hill on the country road leading to their farm.JULIEPappa.
          The French Farmer sinks his axe in the stump, looks over his shoulder,
          and see's the Germans approaching.
          The FARMERS WIFE, CHARLOTTE comes to the doorway of their home,
          followed by her TWO OTHER TEENAGE DAUGHTERS, and see the Germans
          approaching.
          The Farmer yells to his family in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;FARMERGo back inside and shut the door.ILFARMER(to Julie)
          Julie, get me some water from the pump
          to wash up with, then get inside with
          your mother.
          The young lady runs to the water pump by the house. She picks up a
          basin, and begins pumping, after a few pumps, water comes out
          splashing into the basin.
          The French Farmer sits down on the stump he was previously chopping
          away at, pulls a handkerchief from his pocket, wipes sweat from off
          his face, and waits for the Nazi convoy to arrive. After living for
          a year with the sword of Damocles suspended over his head, this may
          very well be the end.
          Julie finishes filling the water basin, and places it on the window
          sill.JULIEReady Pappa.FARMERThank you darling, now go inside and
          take care of your mother. Don't run.
          Julie walks inside the farm house and closes the door behind her.
          As her father stands up from his stump, and moves over to the window
          sill with the water basin...
          .The SOUND of the ENGINES of the two motorcycles and car get LOUDER.
          The Farmer SPLASHES water from the basin on his face and down his
          front. He takes a towel off a nail, and wipes the excess water from
          his face and chest, as he watches the two motorcycles, the one
          automobile, and the four representatives of the National Socialist
          Party come to a halt on his property.
          We don't move into them, but keep observing them from a distance, like
          the Farmer.
          The TWO NAZI MOTORCYCLIST are off their bikes, and standing at
          attention next to them.
          The NAZI DRIVER has walked around the automobile, and opened the door
          for his superior.
          The NAZI OFFICER says to The Driver in UNSUBTITLED GERMAN;NAZI OFFICERThis is the property of Perrier LaPadite?3NAZI DRIVERYes heer Colonel.
          The Nazi officer climbs out of the back the vehicle, carrying
          in his left hand
           n dOFFICERHerman, until I summon you, I am to be
          left alone.NAZI DRIVERAs you wish Heer Col.
          The S.S. COLONEL yells to The Farmer in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;NAZI OFFICERIs this the property of Perrier LaPadite?FARMERI am Perrier LaPadite.
          The S.S. Colonel crosses the distance between them with long strides,
          and says in French with a smile on his face;NAZI OFFICERIt is a pleasure to meet you Monsieur
          LaPadite, I am Colonel Hans Landa of
          the S.S.
          COLONEL.HANS LANDA offers the French Farmer PERRIER LAPADITE his hand.
          The Frenchman takes the German hand in his and shakes it.PERRIERHow may I help you?COL LANDAI was hoping you could invite me inside
          your home and we may have a discussion.INT - LAPADITE FARM HOUSE - DAYThe door to the farm house swings open, andtheaFarmer gesturestfor
          the S.S. COL to enter. Removing his grey S.S. cap,
          inside the Frenchman's home.
          Col Landa is immediately greeted with the sight of the Farmers wife,
          and three pretty daughters standing together in the kitchen, smiling
          in his direction.
          The Farmer enters behind him, closing the door.VAPERRIERColonel Landa, this is my family.
          The S.S. COL clicks his heels together, and takes the hand of the
          French Farmers Wife...COL LANDACol Hans Landa of the S.S. madame,
          at your service.
          He kisses her hand, then continues without letting go of his hostess
          hand...COL LANDAplease excuse my rude intrusion on your
          routine.FARMERS WIFEDon't be ridiculous, heer Col.
          While still holding the French Woman's hand, and looking into her
          eyes, The S.S. Colonel says;COL LANDAMonsieur LaPadite, the rumors I have
          heard in the village about your family
          are all true. Your wife is a beautiful
          woman.
          His eyes leave the mother, and move to the three daughters.COL.LANDA(CON' T )And each of your daughters is more lovely
          then the last.PERRIERMerci. Please have a seat.
          The Farmer offers The S.S. Colonel a seat at the families wooden
          dinner table. The Nazi officer excepts the French Farmers offer,
          and lowers himself into the chair. Placing his grey S.S. cap on
          the table, and keeping his black attache case on the floor by his
          feet.
          The Farmer (perfect host) turns to his Wife and says;PERRIERCharlotte, would you be so good as to get
          The Colonel some wine?COL LANDAMerci be coupe Monsieur LaPadite, but no
          wine. This being a dairy farm one would
          be safe in assuming you have milk?CHARLOTTEOui.COL LANDAThen milk is what I prefer.CHARLOTTEVery Well.
          The mother of three, takes a craft of milk out of the ice box,
          and pours a tall glass of the fresh white liquid for The Colonel.
          The S.S. Colonel takes a long drink from the glass, then puts it down
          LOUDLY on the wooden table.COL LANDAMonsieur, to both your family, and your
          cows, I say; Bravo.PERRIERMerci.COL LANDAPlease, join me at your
          table.PERRIERVery well.
          The French Farmer sit's at his wooden dinner table across from
          The Nazi.
          The Women remain standing.
          Col Landa leans forward, and says to the Farmer in a low tone ofCONFIDENTIALLY;COL LANDAMonsieur LaPadite, what we have to
          discuss,' would be better discussed in
          private. You'll notice, I left my men
          outdoors- if it wouldn't offend them,
          could you ask your lovely ladies to step
          outside.PERRIERYou are right.G.PERRIER(to his women)
          Charlotte, would you take the girls
          outside. The Colonel and I need to have
          a few words.
          The Farmers wife follows her husbands orders, and gathers her
          daughter's taking them outside, closing the door behind them.
          The Two Men are alone, at the farmers dinner table, in the Farmers
          humble home.COL LANDAMonsieur LaPadite, I regret to inform
          you I've exhausted the extent of my
          French. To continue to speak it so
          inadequately, would only serve to
          embarrass me. However, I've been lead
          to believe you speak English quite well?PERRIEROui.COL LANDAWell, it just so happens, I do as well.
          This being your house, I ask your
          permission to switch to English, for the
          remainder of the conversation?PERRIERBy all means.
          They now speak ENGLISH;COL LANDAMonsieur LaPadite, while I'm very
          familiar with you, and your family.
          I have no way of knowing if you are
          familiar with who I am. Are you aware
          of my existence?
          The Farmer answers;PERRIERYes.COL LANDAThis is good. Are you aware of the job
          I've been ordered to carry out in France?IPERRIERYes.
          The Colonel drinks more milk.COL LANDAPlease tell me what you've heard?PERRIERI've heard, the fuhrer has put you in
          charge of rounding up the Jews left in
          France who are ether hiding, or passing
          for Gentile.
          The S.S.Colonel smiles.COL LANDAThe Fuhrer couldn't of said it better
          himself.PERRIERBut the meaning of your visit, pleasant
          though it is, is mysterious to me.
          The Germans looked through my house nine
          months ago for hiding Jews, and found
          nothing.COL LANDAI'm aware of that, I read the report on
          this area. But like any enterprise,
          when under new management, there's
          always a slight duplication of efforts.
          Most of it being a complete waste of time,
          but needs to be done nevertheless.
          I just have A few questions Monsieur
          LaPadite, if you can assist me with
          answers, my department can close the
          file on your family.
          Taking his black leather attache case, and placing it on the table, he
          takes out a folder from inside. He also extracts a expensive black
          fountain pen from his uniform front pocket. Opening the folder, and
          referring to it;COL LANDANow before the occupation there were
          four Jewish families in this area, all
          dairy farmers like yourself.
          The Loveitts, The Doleracs, The Rollins,
          and The Dreyfus's, is that correct?8,PERRIERTo my knowledge those were the Jewish
          families among the dairy farmers.
          - Heer Colonel, would it disturb you if
          I smoked my pipe?
          Looking up from his papers.COL LANDAPlease, Monsieur LaPadite, it is your
          house, make yourself comfortable.
          The Farmer gets up from the table, goes to his shelf over the
          fireplace, and removes from it a WOODEN BOX that contains all the
          fixins to his pipe. He sits back down at the table with his Nazi
          guest.
          As The Farmer loads the bowel of his pipe with tobacco, sets a match
          to it, and begins slowly puffing, making it red hot, the S.S. Colonel
          studies the papers in front of him.COL LANDANow according to these papers, all
          the Jewish families in this area have
          been accounted for - except, The Dreyfusis.
          Somewhere in the last year it would appear
          they have vanished.
          Which leads me to the conclusion that
          they've ether made good their escape,
          or someone is very successfully hiding
          them.
          (looking up from
          his papers, across
          the table at TheFARMER)What have you heard about The Dreyfusis
          Monsieur LaPadite?PERRIEROnly rumors -COL LANDA- I love rumors! Facts can be so
          misleading, where rumors, true or false
          are often reveling. So Monsieur LaPadite,
          what rumors have you heard regarding
          The Dreyfusis?
          The Farmerlooks at Landa.I.COL LANDASpeak freely Monsieur LaPadite, I want
          to hear what the rumors are, not who told
          them to you.
          The Farmer puffs thoughtfully on his pipe.PERRIERAgain, this is just a rumor - but we
          heard the Dreyfusis had made there way
          into Spain.COL LANDASo the rumors you've heard have been of
          escape?PERRIERYes.COL LANDAWere the LaPadites and the Dreyfusis
          friendly?
          As the Farmer answers this question, the CAMERA LOWERS behind his
          chair, to the floor, past the floor, to a small area underneath the
          floorboards revealing;FIVE HUMAN BEINGSlying vertically underneath the farmers floorboards. These human
          beings are The DREYFUSIS, who have lived lying down underneath the
          dairy farmers house for the past year. But one couldn't call what The
          Dreyfusis have done for the last year living. This family has done the
          only thing they could, hidden from a occupying army that wishes to
          exterminate them.PERRIERWe were families in the same community,
          in the same bussiness. I wouldn't say
          we were friends, but members of the same
          community, we had common interest.
          The S.S. Colonel takes in this answer, seems to except it, then moves
          to the next question.COL LANDAHaving never met the Dreyfusis, would
          you confirm for me the exact members of
          the household and their names?10.PERRIERThere were five of them.
          The father, Jacob... .wife, Miram...
          her brother, Bob ...COL LANDA- How old is Bob?PERRIERThirty - thirty one?COL LANDAContinue.PERRIERAnd the children... Amos... and Shoshanna.COL LANDAAges of the children?PERRIERAmos - six - I believe. And Shosanna,
          was fifteen or sixteen, I'm not really
          sure.CUT TOUXT - DAIRY FARM - DAYThe Mother and her three Daughters finish taking the laundry off the
          clothes line.
          They can't hear anything going on inside.
          e three Nazi Soldiers watch the three Daughters.SACK TO LANDA AND PERRIERCOL LANDAWell I guess that should do it.
          Be begins gathering up his papers, and putting them back into his
           ttache case.
          the Farmer, cool as a cucumber, puffs on his pipe.COL LANDAHowever, before I go, could I have another
          glass of your delicious milk?it.PERRIERBut of course.
          Farmer stands up, goes over to the ice box, and takes out the
          aft of milk. As he walks over and fills the Nazi Colonel's glass,
          German Officer talks.COL LANDAMonsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the
          nickname the people of France have given
          me?PERRIERI have no interest in such things.COL LANDABut you are aware of what they call me?PERRIERI'm aware.COL LANDAWhat are you aware of?PERRIERThat they call you, "The Jew Hunter".COL LANDAPrecisely! Now I understand your
          trepidation in repeating it.
          Before he was assassinated, Heydrich
          apparently hated the moniker the good
          people of Prague bestowed on him.
          Actually why he would hate the name,
          "The Hangman", is baffling to me
          It would appear he did everything in
          his power to earn it. But I, on the
          other hand, love my unofficial title,
          precisely because I've earned it.
          As "The Jew Hunter" enjoys his fresh milk, he continues to theorize
          with the french farmer.COL LANDAThe feature that makes me such a effective
          hunter of the Jews, is, as opposed to most
          German soldiers, I can think like a jew.
          where they can only think like a German,
          or more precisely, a German soldier.
          Now if one were to determine what attribute
          the German people share with a beast, it
          would be the cunning and predatory instinct
          of a hawk.COL LANDA(CON'T)Negro's - gorilla's - brain - lips -
          smell - physical strength - penis size.
          But, if one were to determine what attributes
          the jews share with a beast, it would be
          that of the rat.
          Now the Fuhrer and Gobbles propaganda
          have said pretty much the same thing.
          Where our conclusions differ, is I don't
          consider the comparison a insult.
          Consider for a moment, the world a rat
          lives in. It's a hostile world indeed.
          If a rat were to scamper through your
          front door right now, would you greet it
          with hostility?PERRIERI suppose I would.COL LANDAHas a rat ever done anything to you to
          create this animosity you feel toward
          them?PERRIERRat's spread disease, they bite people -COL LANDA- Unless some fool is stupid enough to
          try and handle a live one, rats don't
          make it a practise of biting human beings.
          Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague,
          but that was some time ago. In all your
          born days, has a rat ever caused you to
          be sick a day in your life? I purpose to
          you, any disease a rat could spread,
          a squirrel could equally carry.
          Yet I assume you don't share the same
          animosity with squirrels that you do with
          rats, do you?PERRIERNo.COL LANDAYet, they are both rodent's, are they
          not? And except for the fact that one
          has a big bushy tail, while the other
          has a long repugnt tail of rodent skin,
          they even rather look alike, don't they?13.6PERRIERIt is a interesting thought,
          beer Colonel.COL LANDAHowever, interesting as the thought may
          be, it makes not one bit of difference
          to how you feel. If a rat were to scamper
          through your door, this very minute,
          would you offer it a saucer of your
          delicious milk?PERRIERProbably not.COL LANDAI didn't think so. You don't like them.
          You don't really know why you don't like
          them. All you know is, you find them
          repulsive.
          (let's theMETAPHORsink in)
          What a tremendously hostile world a rat
          must endure. Yet, not only does he
          survive, he thrives. And the reason for
          this, is because our little foe has a
          instinct for survival and presavation
          second to none. And that Monsieur, is
          what a jew shares with a rat.
          Consequently, a German soldier, conducts
          a search of a house suspected of hiding
          jews. Where does the hawk look? He looks
          in the barn, he looks in the attic,
          he looks in the cellar - he looks
          everywhere, he would hide. But there are
          many places it would never occur to a
          hawk to hide. However the reason the
          Fuhrer brought me off my Alps in Austria,
          and placed me in French cow country today,
          is because it does occur to me. Because
          I'm aware what tremendous feats human
          beings are capable of once they abandon
          dignity.
          (Changing tone)
          May I smoke my pipe as well?
          Th e Farmer's cool facade is little by little eroding.PERRIERPlease, Cononel, make yourself at home.13.The Jew Hunter, removes both a pipe and a bag of tobacco fixings.
          The pipe, strangely enough, is a Calabash, made from a "S" shaped goard
          kith a yellow skin, made famous by Sherlock Holmes.
          A the Nazi Colonel, busies himself with his smoking life, he
          ontinues to hold court at the Frenchmans table.COL LANDAThe other mistake the German soldier
          make is their severe handling of the
          citizens who give shelter and aid to
          the Jews. These citizens are not enemies
          of the state. They are simply confused
          people, trying to make some sense out of
          the madness war creates.
          These citizens do not need punishing.
          They simply need to be reminded of their
          duty in war time.
          Let's use you as a example Monsieur
          LaPadite. In this war, you have found
          yourself in the middle of a conflict
          that has nothing to do with yourself,
          your lovely ladies, or your cows - yet,
          here you are.
          So Monsieur LaPadite, let me purpose
          a question. In this time of war, what is
          your number one duty? Is it to fight the
          Germans in the name of France to your
          last breath? Or, is it to harass the
          occupying army to the best of your
          ability? Or, is it to protect the poor
          unfortunate victims of warfare who can
          not protect themselfs?
          Or, is your number one duty in this time
          of bloodshed, to protect those very

          probably be turned in by some neighbour.
          Or, she'll be spotted by some German
          soldier. Or, we'll find her body in the
          woods, dead from starvation or exposure.

          She opens the door to go inside.GERMAN SOLDIERMay I ask your name?SHOSANNAYou wish to see my papers?
          She hands him her excellently forged papers.

          He gives her a little salute, and walks into the black of a
          curfew imposed night.
          She looks after him. She didn't show it, but he kinda got to

          she remembers a voice.FLASH ONMADAME MIMIEUX, the younger Shosanna, and the black
          projectionist Marcel, in the projection booth. Shosanna
          lights up a cigarette, and Madame Mimieux SLAPS her face
          HARD, knocking the cigarette out of her mouth. Marcel
          quickly STAMPS it out on the floor.If-7.MADAME MIMIEUXif I ever see you light up a cigarette
          in my cinema again, I'll turn you into
          the Nazi's, do you understand?
          Shosanna is shocked by this statement.SHOSANNAOui, Madame.MADAME MIMIEUXAnd for bringing a open flame in my
          cinema, you deserve far worse then
          a Nazi jewish boxcar. With your thick
          head, what do you think the highest
          priority of a cinema manager is?
          Keeping this fucking place from burning
          down to the ground, that's what!
          In my collection, I have over 350,

          do it. To hear Madames voice again.MARCELWe both miss her.SHOSANNAI know. I'm fine, darling. I'll be
          to bed soon.
          Marcel goes back inside, Shosanna smokes.INT - FRENCH BISTRO - AFTERNOONShosanna sits in the back of a French bistro, reading a
          book, "The Saint in New York" by Leslie Charteris, drinking
          wine. When the young German Private from the other day,
          FREDRICK ZOLLER, walks in. He gets a beer, then notices the
          French girl sitting in the back. He smiles, and heads over
          to her. "Oh no, not this guy again", she thinks.
          Again they speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;FREDRICKMay I join you?SHOSANNALook Fredrick -FREDRICK(SMILING)- You remember my name?SHOSANNAYes....Look, you seem a pleasant
          enough fellow -FREDRICK- Merci.SHOSANNAYour welcome. - regardless, I want
          you to stop pestering me.FREDRICKI apologize mademoiselle, I wasn't
          trying to be a pest. I was simply
          trying to be friendly.SHOSANNAI don't wish to be your friend.FREDRICKWhy not?SHOSANNADon't act like a infant. You know why.FREDRICKI'm more then just a uniform.SHOSANNANot to me. If you are so desperate for
          a French girlfriend, I suggest you try
          Vichy?
          Just then TWO OTHER GERMAN SOLDIERS come over, obviously
          very impressed with Fredrick. They make a fuss over him in
          UNSUBTITLED GERMAN, which nether Shosanna, or the non German
          speaking members of the movies audience, can understand.
          He signs autographs for them, shakes their hands, and they
          go on their way.
          Shosanna's eyes narrow.SHOSANNAWho are you?FREDRICKI thought I was just a uniform?SHOSANNAYour not just a German soldier, are
          you somebodies son?FREDRICKMost German soldiers are somebodies son.SHOSANNAYeah, but your not just somebody. What
          are you, Hitlers nephew?
          He leans in across the table, she leans in too, and he says;FREDRICKYes.SHOSANNAReally?FREDRICKNo not really, I'm just teasing you.
          She leans back annoyed.SHOSANNAThen what is it? What are you, a German
          movie star?6'OFREDRICKNot exactly.SHOSANNA(Pfuit), what does that mean, "not exactly".
          I asked if you were a movie star, the
          answer to that question, is yes or no.
          Fredrick laughs at that line.FREDRICRWhen you said that just now, you
          reminded me of my sister.
          This catches young Shosanna off guard.FREDRICRI come from a home of six sisters.
          We run a family operated cinema in Munich.
          Seeing you run around your cinema,
          reminds me of them. Especially my sister
          Helga. She raised me, when our father
          wasn't up to the job. I admire her very
          much. You'd like her, she doesn't wear a
          German uniform.SHOSANNAYou were raised by Helga?FREDRICKAll my sisters, I'm the baby, but Helga
          was the bossiest.SHOSANNAAnd your mother and father?FREDRICKMy mother died. And my father was a
          loser. My fathers moto; "If at first
          you don't succeed, quit". The day he
          left, good riddance. My sisters are
          all I need. It's why I like your cinema.
          It makes me feel both closer to them,
          and a little homesick at the same time.SHOSANNAis your cinema still operatiing?FREDRICROui.SHOSANNAWhat's it called?5!FREDRICKThe Kino Haus.SHOSANNAHow has it done durring the war?FREDRICKActually, in Germany, cinema
          attendance is up.SHOSANNANo doubt, you don't have to operate
          under a curfew.FREDRICKHow often do you fill your house?SHOSANNA(Pfuit), not since before the war.FREDRICKSo if you had one big engagement, that
          would help you out?SHOSANNAOf course, but that's not likely to
          happen.
          TWO MORE GERMAN SOLDIERS and their TWO FRENCH DATES approach
          the table. They ask for Fredricks autograph, he signs it for
          them. One of the French Girls says in FRENCH, how exciting
          it is to meet a real live German war hero. Shosanna hears
          it. They leave. So that's it, she thinks.SHOSANNASo your a war hero? Why didn't you tell me?FREDRICKEverybody knows that, I liked you didn't.SHOSANNAWhat did you do?
          He takes a sip of beer.FREDRICKI've shot the most enemy soldiers
          in world war two...so far.
          You bet your sweet ass that got her attention.SHOSANNAWow.52FREDRICKI was alone in a bell tower in a
          walled off city in Russia. It was
          myself, and a thousand rounds of ammo,
          in a bird's nest, against three
          hundred Soviet soldiers.SHOSANNAWhat's a bird's nest?FREDRICKA bird's nest is what a sniper would call
          a bell tower. It's a high structure,
          offering a three hundred and sixty degree
          view. Very advantageous for marksmen.SHOSANNAHow many Russian's did you kill?FREDRICKSixty-eight.(BEAT)The first day. A hundred and fifty the
          second day. Thirty-two, the third day.
          On the forth day, they exited the city.
          Naturally my war story received alot of
          attention in Germany, that's why they
          all recognize me. They call me the
          German Sgt.York.SHOSANNAMaybe they'll make a film about
          your exploits.FREDRICKWell, that's just what Joseph Goebbels
          thought. So he did. It's called "Nation's
          Pride", and guess what, they wanted me to
          play myself, so I did. They have posters
          for it in kiosks all over Paris. That's
          another reason for all the attention.SHOSANNA"Nation's Pride" is about you? "Nation's
          Pride" is starring you?FREDRICKI know, comical, huh?SHOSANNANot so comical. So what are you doing
          in Paris, enjoying a rest?53.FREDRICKHardly. I've been doing publicity,
          having my picture taken with different
          German luminaries, visiting troops,
          that sort of thing. Goebbels wants the
          film to premier in Paris, so I've been
          helping them in the planning.
          Joseph is very keen on this film.
          He's telling anybody who will listen,
          when "Nation's Pride" is released,
          I'll be the German Van Johnson.
          Shosanna, wasn't falling for the young German, by any stretch.
          However his exploits, as well as his charming manner, can't
          help but impress. But his referring to Goebbels as "Joseph",
          like their friends, is all she needed to get on the right side
          of things. This young man is trouble with a capital "T", and
          she needs to stay far fucking away from him.
          She abruptly rises, and says;SHOSANNAWell, good luck with your premier
          Private. I hope all goes well for
          Joseph and yourself. Au revoir.
          And with that, she disappears. Leaving the perplexed private
          alone.EXT - CINEMA MARQUEE - DAYIt's the next day.
          Shosanna and Marcel are changing the letters on the marquee.
          Marcel excuses himself to visit the toilet.
          $hosanna is alone outside the little cinema, perched up on her
          ladder.WHEN....A BLACK NAZI SEDAN pulls up in front of the little cinema.
          A GERMAN MAJOR in a black Gestapo uniform steps out of the back
          of the sedan.
          The DRIVER, a German Private, steps out as well.

          and where do you propose to take me?
          The Driver begins to translate, when the Gestapo Major holds up his
          hand, telling him not to bother. The Major looks at the young
          French girl and tells her in German;55.GESTAPO MAJORGet your ass in that car.
          No translation necessary. She climbs into the back of the car,

          The sedan stops.
          The car door opens and the Driver offers Shosanna his hand.EXT/INT- MAXIUM'S (FAMOUS PARIS CAFE) - DAYShe steps out of the car, and is lead into a Paris cafe by the
          Gestapo Officer. It takes the young Jewess a moment or two before
          she realizes she's not being led to a Gestapo interrogation
          room, a railroad car, or a concentration camp, but to lunch.
          The best table at Maxims. Three people, and two dogs, sit at it.
          Germany's Minister of Propaganda, and the number two man in
          Hitlers Third Reich, JOSEPH GOEBBELS, his female French translator
          (and mistress), FRANCESCA MONDINO, and young Private Zoller,
          are the people. TWO BLACK FRENCH POODLES, belonging to
          Mademoiselle Mondino, sit together in another chair at the
          table.
          We join them in mid-conversation;

          Private Zoller see's her, and stands up, excuse's himself,
          and greets her before she reaches the table.
          Fredrick says in French, SUBTITLED in ENGLISH;FREDRICKGood you came. I wasn't sure weather or

          arm, and leads her to him.FREDRICKYes it is, beer Goebbels. Emmanuelle,
          there is somebody I want you to meet.
          Joseph Goebbels, remaining seated, looks up at the young French
          girl, scrutinizing her as he spoons creme brule into his mouth.
          The excited Fredrick introduces Shosanna to the propaganda
          minister formally.FREDRICKEmmanuelle Mimieux, I'd like to
          introduce you to the minister of

          Please allow me, have a seat.
          The Gestapo Officer pulls out a chair, for the young lady to sit
          down. Shosanna takes the hot seat. Seated to her right is
          Private Zoller. To her left are the two curly pampered
          poodles. Major Helistrom pours Shosanna a glass of red wine
          from a small craft on the table.MAJOR HELLSTROMTry the wine mademoiselle, it's quite good.
          Goebbels looks across the table at her.GOEBBELSwell I must say, you've made quite a

          with the young Private, and he spends
          the entire lunch speaking of you
          and your cinema.
          Francesca interprets...GOEBBELSSo Fraulein Mimieux, let's get down
          to business.
          Private Zoller interrupts -FREDRICK- Heer Goebbels, I haven't informed

          sure she's figured it out by now,

          Francesca tells Shosanna in French;FRANCESCAWhat they're trying to tell you

          Fredrick jumps in...FREDRICKBut beer Goebbels, that's not such
          a terrible thing. You said yourself
          you didn't want to indulge every
          two faced french bourgeois taking
          up space currying favor. With less
          seat's it makes the event more

          This is a German night, a German
          event, a German celebration. This
          night is for you, me, the German
          military, the high command, their
          family and friends. The only people
          who should be allowed in the room,
          are people who will be moved by
          the exploits on screen.
          Goebbels listens silently, then after a bit of a pause;GOEBBELSI see your public speaking has
          improved. It appears I've created
          a monster. A strangely persuasive
          monster. When the war's over,
          politics awaits.
          Table chuckles.GOEBBELSWell Private, though it is true,
          I'm inclined to indulge you anything.

          Francesca asks...6Z.SHOSANNAI draw a older German audience in
          my cinema, that appreciate the
          nostalgia of the earlier time.
          Francesca interprets...GOEBBELSThat's nonsense fraulein. Us Germans
          are looking forward, not backwards.
          That era of German cinema is dead.
          The German cinema I create, will not
          only be thee cinema of Europe. But
          the worlds only alternative to the
          degenerate Jewish influence of

          for the fraulein, I've outlawed
          film criticism.

          I'm sure Emmanuelle hasn't seen. it.
          And it's so funny, I've been meaning
          to recommend it to her, for her

          done, my most purely enjoyable
          production. Not only that, I
          wouldn't be surprised, if sixty
          years from now, It's "Lucky Kids"

          ...the empty chair next to the young Jewish girl is suddenly
          filled with the bottom half of a grey S.S. officer uniform.GOEBBELSAh Landa, your here, this is the

          She repeats it by whispering it in Goebbels ear.6 "FGOEBBELSOh, yes of course, that's it. So

          Col Landa offers the young jew in hiding a seat at a small
          table in the outside patio area of Maxims.
          The fluency and poetic proficiency of the S.S. jew hunters
          french, revels to the audience, that his feigning clumsiness at

          least... . disconcerting.
          The key to Col Landa's power, and or charm, depending on the
          side ones on, lies in his ability to convince you he's privy to
          your secrets.COL LANDASo Mademoiselle, you were beginning

          This is a simple formality, no
          reason for you to feel anxious.

          raised him.70COL LANDAIt's sounding more and more romantic
          by the minute.
          Landa takes out a handsome looking cigarette case, with a S.S.
          LOGO on it. Removing on of the fags, he lights it up with a
          fancy S.S. gold lighter. He offers one to Shosanna.COL LANDACigarette?SHOSANNANo thank you.COL LANDADo you smoke?SHOSANNAYes.COL LANDAThen I insist, you must take one.
          There not French, there German.
          I hope your not nationalist about
          your tobacco, to me French cigarettes
          are a sin against nicotine.
          She takes one, but makes no move to light it.
          He inhales deep, and says;COL LANDAI did have some thing else I wanted
          to ask you, but right now, for the
          life of me, I can't remember what it
          is. Oh well, must not of been important.
          Col Landa stands up, throws some French francs on the table,
          puts on his grey S.S. cap, touches his finger to his visor,
          saluting Shosanna, and saying:COL LANDATill tonight.
          And with that he's gone.
          Shosanna breaths a sigh of relief.
          The CAMERA begins to slowly lower from a MEDIUM CU to her feet
          ankles and floor. We see her shoes are in a puddle of urine.
          During her conversation and strudel with the man that
          exterminated her entire family, shosanna pissed herself.
          She drops the German cigarette in to the piss puddle by her
          feet.7 1.INT - CINEMA AUDITORIUM - NIGHTThe SILVER SCREEN
          on screen is the German screwball comedy "LUCKY KIDS".

          to be amused by the aryan antics of
          Goebbels Frank Capra copy, "Lucky
          Kids", a thought suddenly comes to
          her.
          We see her face get slightly distracted behind the eyes.NARRATOR (VO)What if tonight, accidently, the
          cinema burned down? The Third Reich
          would lose it's Minister of
          propaganda, it's national hero, and
          it's top jew hunter, all in one fell
          swoop.
          She chuckles at the thought, though it looks like she's
          laughing at the German comedy.SILVER SCREEN"The END" card for "Lucky Kids" is projected.
          The Nazi rouges gallery, and Shosanna, applaud the film.IZThe lights go up.PGoebbels excepts congratulations, as they stand and begin to
          file out into the lobby.NARRATOR(VO)The screening of "Lucky Kids" was a
          complete success. And Heer Goebbels
          conceded to have the venue changed
          to Shosannas cinema. Not only that,
          in a moment of inspiration, Heer
          Goebbels had a idea.
          Goebbels speaks GERMAN, and Francesca translates;GOEBBELSI must say, I appreciate the modesty
          of this auditorium. Your Cinema
          has real respect, almost church like.
          Not to say we couldn't spruce the
          place up a bit. In Versailles
          there's a crystal chandelier hanging
          in the banquet hall that is
          extraordinary. we're going to get it,
          and hang it from the very middle of
          auditorium roof. Also I want to go to
          Louvre, pick up a few Greek nudes,
          and just scatter them about the lobby.MONTAGEwe see a quick series of shots that show all that happening.
          The chandelier being removed from the ceiling of Versailles.
          Greek nude statues being hand trucked out of the Louvre.
          A truck driving through the french countryside with the
          enormous crystal chandelier in the back.
          The lobby of Shosanna's cinema, pimped out in Nazi iconography.
          WORKERS buzz around decorating. The Greek statues are moved
          into place.
          We see Workers trying with incredible difficulty, to hoist the
          huge, heavy, and twinkingly fragile chandelier, in Shosannas
          auditorium, which now resembles something out of one of Tinto
          Brass's Italian B-movie rip off's of Visconti's "The Damned".SHOSANNAwatches all this from a opera box, she shakes her head in
          disbelief.73BACK TO SHOSANNA AND THE NAZI "Sin the lobby, post screening of "Lucky Rids", she's soundlessly
          escorting them to the door, as they make their goodbyes.NARRATOR (VO)As they left the little French
          cinema that night, all the Germans
          were very happy...

          The Nazi's are gone.
          Marcel sits at the top of the staircase of the lobby, looking
          down at Shosanna.
          They speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;MARCELWhat the fuck are we suppose to do?SHOSANNAIt looks like we're suppose to have
          a Nazi premier.MARCELLike I said, what the fuck are we
          suppose to do?SHOSANNAWell, I need to speak with you
          about that.MARCELAbout what?SHOSANNAAbout these Hun swine, commandeering
          our cinema.MARCELWhat about it?
          She slowly walks up the stairs to Marcel. She makes him part
          his legs, and sits on the lower step, between his legs. Her
          back up against his chest, his arms around her shoulders.
          Shosanna has only known this type of intimacy with Marcel.SHOSANNAWell, when I was watching the bosch
          (Said inENGLISH)Capra-corn abomination,

          about?SHOSANNAFilling the cinema with Nazi's and
          their whores, and burning it down
          to the ground.MARCELI'm not talking about that, your
          talking about that.SHOSANNANo, we're talking about that,
          right now. If we can keep this
          place from burning down by
          ourselves, we can burn it down
          by ourselves.MARCELShosanna -SHOSANNANo, Marcel, just for sake of argument,
          if we wanted to burn down the cinema,
          for any number of reasons, you and I
          could physically accomplish that, no?MARCELOui Shosanna, we could do that.SHOSANNAAnd with Madame Mimieux's 350 nitrate
          film print collection, we wouldn't
          even need explosives, would we?MARCELYou mean we wouldn't need any more
          explosives?SHOSANNAOui, that's exactly what I mean.
          She begins kissing his hands.75.SHOSANNA(CON'T)I am going to burn down the cinema
          on Nazi night.
          One of his fingers probes her mouth.SHOSANNA(CON'T)And if I'm going to burn down the
          cinema, which I am, we both know,
          your not going to let me do it
          by myself.
          The back of her head presses up hard against him, as his hand
          both caresses, and grips her lovely neck.SHOSANNA(CON'T)Because you love me. And I love you.
          And your the only person on this earth

          She then TWISTS around, so she's straddling him. They are now,
          face to face.SHOSANNA(CON'T)But that's not all we're going to do.
          Does the filmmaking equipment it the
          attic still work? I know the film
          camera does. How about the sound
          recorder?MARCELQuite well, actually. I recorded a

          A snappy handsome British Lieutenant in dress browns, steps inside
          the room. This officer, who has been mixing it up with
          the Gerrys since the late thirties, is named LT.ARCHIE HICOX.
          A young George Sanders type(The Saint and Private affairs of

          Upon entering the room, Lt.Hicox is gobsmacked.
          Standing before him is legendary military mastermind,
          GENERAL ED FENECH, a older George Sanders type (Village of the
          Dammed).

          requires a knowledge of the German
          film industry under the Third Reich.
          Explain to me UFA, under Goebbels?LT.HICOXGoebbels considers the films he's
          making to be the beginning of a new
          era in German cinema. A alternative
          to what he considers the Jewish
          German intellectual cinema of the
          twenties. And the Jewish controlled
          dogma of Hollywood.

          at their own game? Compared to say
          .Louis B.Mayer...how's he doing?LT.HICOXQuite well, actually. Since Goebbels
          has taken over, film attendance has
          steadily risen in Germany over the
          last eight years. But Louis B.Mayer
          wouldn't be Goebbels proper opposite
          number. I believe Goebbels see's himself

          stuck to their forehead. The player doesn't know what name is
          on their forehead. So they ask the others questions to figure

          something very different.WINNETOUOkay, I'm a fictional, literary

          take in the movies?BRIDGETWell, yes they did, but it's not really
          that difficult.SGT.POLA NEGRIDo one for us.
          The Tableheartily agrees.
          Bridget looks directly at the Master Sgt, and does a perfect,
          and perfectly funny, Double Take.
          The Table loves it.q3.MATA HARIMy turn, I want to try.
          Mata Hari, looks directly at Beethoven, and does a Double
          Take.EDGER WALLACEI want to try.
          He does.
          Soon the whole Table is doing dueling Double Takes.HICOX - WICKI - STIGLITZwatch the table do dueling Double Takes. Obviously, they don't
          understand.THEN....Bridget Von Hammersmark rises, and excuses herself from the
          Table. She removes the card stuck in her fedora, looking at
          the name Gengus Khaun for the first time.BRIDGETGengus Khaun! I would never of gotten that.
          She walks over, and joins the masquerading Germans table, the
          Gentlemen rise. She greets each warmly with a french cheek
          kiss, as if she knows them well.
          They all take a seat. The two Basterds, and one Brit, drink
          Whiskey. The taverns PROPRIETOR, a older, big bellyed
          Frenchman named EARL, comes over to the table, and pours more
          champagne into Bridget's Champagne glass. He leaves, returning
          back behind the bar, with the YOUNG FRENCH BARMAID, the only other
          person in the establishment.
          Obviously, they speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;LT.HICOXI thought this place was suppose to
          have more French then Germans?BRIDGETNormally that's true. The Sgt over
          there's wife, just had a baby. His
          commanding officer gave him, and his
          mates the night off to celebrate.WICXIWe should leave.BRIDGETF No, we should stay. For one drink at
          least. I've been waiting for you in a
          bar, it would look strange if we left
          before we had a drink.LT.HICOXShe's right, just be calm, and enjoy
          your booze.BACK TO THE GERMAN TABLEThe French Barmaid, has taken Bridget's place in the rousing,
          rowdy game. She tells them, her person must be French, or she
          won't know them. Winnetou thinks for a moment, then writes a
          name on a card. The Barmaid puts it on her forehead, It says;NAPOLEON.The Germans all laugh.BACK TO THE BASTERDS TABLEBRIDGETThere's been some new developments.
          The cinema venue has changed.LT.HICOXWhy?BRIDGETNo one knows. But that in itself
          shouldn't be a problem. The cinema
          it's been changed to is considerably
          smaller then The Ritz. So whatever
          materials you brought for The Ritz,
          should be doubly effective here.
          Now this next piece of information
          is colossal, try not to over react.
          The Fubrer, will be attending tomorrow.
          Hugo Stiglitz does a SPIT TAKE.
          Bridget's eyes bore holes in him.BACK TO THE REAL GERMANSThey see Hugo do the spit take, and burst out laughing.
          Keeping it up, they begin to do dueling spit takes, like they
          did dueling double takes earlier. Needless to say, they all
          get wet.9BACK TO BASTERDSBRIDGET(To Hicox)
          You'll be going as Ernst Schuller.
          You'll say your a associate producer
          on Riefenstahl's "Tiefland". It's the
          one German production not under Goebbels

          head toward Fraulein Von Bammersmark.BRIDGET.the films gone through many delays,
          and Leni's heath is deteriorating, so

          Hicox, seeing the German Master Sgt approach, signals for her
          to cool it.SGT.POLA NEGRIFrau Von Hammersmark, I was just
          thinking, could you sign a autograph
          to my son on his birthday?BRIDGETI'd love to Wilhelm.
          (To the Table)
          This handsome happy Sgt, just became
          a father today.
          The Pretend Officers offer congratulations to the Sgt.
          The German Master Sgt, CLICKS his heels, and bows before his
          superior officers.SGT.POLA NEGRIThank you, heil Hitler.
          He raises his hand .... as do the seated phony officers; "Heil
          Hitler".
          As she takes a rather fancy fountain pen from her clutch..BRIDGETSo Wilhelm, do you know the name of
          this progeny yet?SGT.POLA NEGRII most certainly do, fraulein. His
          name is Maximilian.
          Even the slightly psychotic Stiglitz, likes this German Sgt.STIGLITZWonderful name, Sgt.SGT.POLA NEGRIThank you, Lieutenant. When he's old
          enough to ride a bicycle, I will buy
          him a blue one. And I will paint on
          the side "The Blue Max".
          He thrusts out his beer stein, for the officers to cheers.
          They do.
          Bridget finishes signing her autograph, with a big flourish.BRIDGETThere you go. But wait, I'm not finished yet.
          She reaches into her clutch, and pulls out some lipstick.
          Applies some ruby red color to her lips, and then kisses the
          napkin, leaving a big red lip print. Then hands the treasured
          item to the young father.BRIDGETNothing but the best for little Maximilian.SGT.POLA NEGRIThank you fraulein, thank you. Max may
          not know who you are now. But he will.
          I will show him all of your movies.
          He will grow up with your films,
          and this napkin on his wall.
          Then, to the whole tavern...SGT.POLA NEGRII purpose a toast to the greatest actress
          in Germany! There is no Dietrich, there is
          no Riefenstahl, only Von Hammersmark!
          The whole room toasts.
          This would be a good time for the German Sgt to go back to his
          table, and his men. And he almost does.... but... since he is
          drunk, and star struck, he out wears his welcome.SGT.POLA NEGRISo, Frau Von Hammersmark, what brings
          you to France?97 .Feeling any good Nazi officer's patience would of been
          exhausted long ago, Lt.Hicox butts in.LT.HICOXNone of your business,Sgt.

          The German Master Sgt., looks quizzically at the officer.SGT.POLA NEGRIExcuse me Cap't, but your accent is
          is very unusual.
          The whole room pauses-for different reasons...SGT.POLA NEGRIWhere are you from?
          A silent moment passes between the two tables, then the two
          German born impostors spring into action.WICKISgt.! You must be ether drunk or mad,

          The Five known Germans move aside, reveling the unknown German
          in the room, unseen till now, our old friend from before
          MAJOR DEITER HELLSTROM of the GESTAPO. The Major stands from
          the little table he was sitting at.MAJOR HELLSTROMLike the young newly christened father,
          I too have a acute ear for accents.
          And like him, I too find yours odd.
          From where do you hail, Cap't?
          Wicki jumps in;WICKIMajor, this is highly inappr -MAJOR HELLSTROMT wasn't speaking to you
          Lt.Saltzberg,
          (Turning toSTIGLITZ)or you ether, Lt.Berlin.
          (Looking atHICOX)I was speaking to Cap't I--don't-know-what.
          The Gestapo Major is now standing beside Sgt.Pola, before the
          impostors table.
          Lt.Hicox, calmly explains his origin.LT.HICOXI was born in the village that rests
          in the shadow of Piz Palu.MAJOR HELLSTROMThe mountain?LT.HICOXYes. In that village we all speak like
          this. Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?MAJOR HELLSTROMYes.f q sLT. HICOXThen you saw me. You remember the skiing
          torch scene?MAJOR HELLSTROMYes I do.LT.HICOXIn that scene was myself, my father,
          my sister, and my two brothers. My
          brother is so handsome, the director
          Pabst, gave him a Close Up.
          As Bridget Von Hammersmark places a cigarette in a ivory
          cigarette holder, which Hicox, as if on cue, lights for her,
          she says;BRIDGETMajor, if my word means anything, I can
          vouch for everything the Young Cap't has
          just said. He does hail from the bottom
          of Piz Palu, he was in the film,
          and his brother is far more handsome
          then he.
          The impostors laugh.
          Then....so does the Gestapo Major. He turns to the Sgt.MAJOR HELLSTROMYou should rejoin your friends.
          Which the young Sgt is more then happy to do. That table
          begins playing there game again.
          Major Hellstrom, the highest ranking officer in the room, bows
          graciously to the female German celebrity.MAJOR HELLSTROMMay I join you?BRIDGETBy all means, Major.
          The Gestapo Major sits at the table, opposite Lt.Hicox, and
          Wicki. The French Barmaid brings over the Majors beer stein.MAJOR HELLSTROMSo that's the source of your bazaar
          accent? Extraordinary. So what are
          you doing here Cap't?LT.HICOXAside from having a drink with the lovely

          he asks)
          All levity aside, what are you doing

          Chuckle chuckle.BRIDGETThe Captain is my date, but all three
          are my guests. We're old friends Major,
          who go back along time. Longer then
          a actress would care to admit.
          Chuckle chuckle.MAJOR HELLSTROMWell, in that case, let me raise a glass
          to the three luckiest men in the room.BRIDGETI'll drink to that.101They cheers.BACK TO THE REAL GERMAN TABLEThey continue to have alot of fun playing their game.BACK TO OFFICERS TABLEMAJOR HELLSTROMI must say, that game their playing
          looks like a good bit of fun. I didn't
          join them, because your quite right Cap't,
          officers and enlisted men shouldn't
          fraternize. But seeing as we're all
          officers here,
          (Bowing toBRIDGET).and sophisticated lady friends of
          officers. What say we play the game?
          Lt.Hicox begins to refuse, when Bridget (feeling she knows
          better), interrupts him;BRIDGETokay, one game.MAJOR HELLSTROMWUNDERBARThe Major borrows five cards from the other table, and lays
          them out in front of Bridget and the officers.MAJOR HELLSTROMSo the object of the game, is to write
          the name of a famous person on your card.
          Real or fictitious, doesn't matter. For
          instance, you could write Confucius or
          Fu Manchu.

          (Back to players)
          And they must be famous. No Aunt Inga's.
          When you finish writing, put the card
          face down on the table, and move it to
          the person to your left. The person to
          your right, will move their card in
          front of you. You pick up the card
          without looking at it, lick the back,
          and stick it on your forehead like so.
          He demonstrates.)oz.MAJOR HELLSTROM(CON'T)And in ten yes or no questions, you must
          guess who you are...
          As Major Hellstrom finishes explaining the finer points of the
          game, The CAMERA PANS OFF HIM, and BEGINS SLOWLY ZOOMING INTO
          STIGLITZ. The Majors dialogue begins to FADE AWAY.
          Untill we're in a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK. Which is RED
          FILTERED FOOTAGE of Hugo being savagely WHIPPED by somebody
          wearing a GESTAPO UNIFORM, SUPERIMPOSED over his CLOSE UP.
          The Flashback disappears. It's driving Stiglitz crazy, being
          this close to a Gestapo uniform, and not plunging a knife into
          it.
          The Majors Voice comes back on the soundtrack.MAJOR HELLSTROM.So let's give it a try, shall we?
          Everybody write your names.
          The Five players write their names...

          to the jungle, or the Orient. I'm going

          is the jungle? I visited America, but my
          visit was not fortuitous to me, but the
          implication is that it was to somebody

          How about it fraulein? Am I intruding?BRIDGETOf course not, Major.MAJOR HELLSTROMI didn't think so. It's simply the young
          Cap't is immune to my charms.

          But that doesn't exactly kill us
          in the crib. Germans don't have a
          good ear for Italian. So you mumble
          Italian, and brazen through it, is
          that the plan?LT. ALDOThat's about it.BRIDGETThat sounds good.LT. ALDOit sounds like shit, but what else

          attractive Forties style dress for the premiere. She's stunning.
          This is the first time in her life she's had the opportunity,
          or the occasion to wear something like this. Since she knows
          this is the last night of her life, no time like the present.
          SOUNDS of the hub-bub of the premiere, not to mention the
          German brass band that's blaring Third Reich Marches, can be
          heard coming from below.
          Shosanna walks to her apartment window, and looks down at the
          Germatic miasma below.
          SHOSANNAS POV: WE SEE all the pageantry below. Tons of
          SPECTATORS. Tons of guests dressed in Nazi uniforms, tuxedos,
          and female finery, walking up the long red carpet(with a big
          Swastika in the middle, naturally) leading into Shosannas
          cinema. The German brass band omm-pa-pa-ing away. German Radio
          and Film crews covering the event for the fatherland back
          home. And of course, MANY GERMAN SOLDIERS providing security
          for this joyous Germatic occasion.
          Shosanna COUGHS up a lugi, and HOCKS it.
          A GERMAN S.S. GENERAL, being interviewed by a RADIO COMMENTATOR,
          the lugi HITS him right on his bald head.
          Shosanna goes back to the full length mirror, places a very
          fashionable Forties style hat on her head, then lowers the
          period style black fish net veil over her face. She takes out
          a small GUN, and puts it in the pocket of her dress., and it's
          on. She exits the apartment door, to join the premiere.
          From this point on, there's no turning back, it's all the way
          baby, all the fucking way!12.7.INT - CINEMA STAIRWELL - NIGHTThe stairwell in the building that connects the living

          German beautiful people, enter the cinema. They mingle in the
          swastika covered, greek nude statue peppered lobby. Nazi
          Military Commanders, High Ranking Party Officials, and German
          Celebrities(Emil tannings, Veit Harlin), hob knob and drink
          Champagne from passing WAITERS who carry glasses on silver
          trays.
          We see Shosanna enter from the area at the top of the big
          staircase in the lobby that overlooks the lobby parlor
          entrance. She descends the staircase, and busies herself with
          theatre stuff.
          At the top of the staircase, looking down at the master race
          in all there finery, is Colonel Hans Landa, dressed in his
          finest SS Uniform, smoking on his Calabash.CAMERA FRAMEdirectly behind him. On the right side, we see the figure of
          Col.Landa, from behind, watching the guests entering the
          cinema. On the left side of frame, is the cinema entrance,
          from a looking down perspective of the guests entering the
          building.THEN....A THINK BUBBLE, like in a comic book, appears on the left
          side of frame, obscuring the cinema entrance. Inside of Landas
          think bubble, a little scene plays out.THINK BUBBLEInside a hospital room filled with DOCTORS, NURSES, and a
          PATIENT in a hospital bed. Then Col.Landa enters the room, and
          screams at everybody;COL.LANDAI want everybody out of this room!
          They start to leave.COL.LANDAThat means now, goddamnit!
          They RUSH OUT.

          injured your leg, mountain climbing?BRIDGETBelieve it or not, yes it is.
          A brief moment passes between the two...THEN...The Colonel BURSTS OUT with UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER. So uproarious
          in fact, that it's quite disconcerting to the four saboteurs.
          The Colonel begins to regain his composure...COL.LANDAForgive me, fraulein. I don't mean
          laugh at your misfortune. It's just

          is this mountain?
          This stops her for a seconded.

          know me, I tease rough. So who are
          your three handsome escorts?BRIDGETI'm afraid neither three speak a

          Donny hands her two tickets. She indicates for them to follow her.
          Donny and Hirschberg both exchange one last look with Aldo,
          then follow the young french girl into the auditorium.INT - AUDITORIUM - NIGHTThe cinema auditorium is filling up quickly with grey and black
          uniforms.
          Shosanna finds the two counterfeit Italians their seats.
          After she points out their seats, she turns to leave...

          cute French girl to smithereens, he says;HIRSCHBERGGrazie.13r.
          The cute French Girl looks back at the goofy looking Italian
          boy with slicked back hair, that makes him look kind of
          Jewish, with tremendous guilt, knowing if she is successful
          tonight, she's going to burn him alive, and says;SHOSANNAPrego.BACK TO LOBBYThey begin flicking the lights on and off. A GERMAN SOLDIER

          What are ether of them suppose to do, argue?
          Col.Landa goes over to one of the Nazi GAURD/USHER, and
          whispers in his ear, gesturing toward Aldo. Like he's saying,
          leave the boy alone, till we come back... .Or is he?
          Col.Landa limps Bridget away towards Shosannas office.
          As Aldo stands in the lobby, more and more people enter the
          auditorium, till it's only Aldo and the six Nazi Gaurd/Ushers
          in the now vacant lobby.INT - SHOSANNA'S OFFICE - NIGHTShosanna's cinema manager office. It's small, cluttered, and
          dominated by a desk.
          They both enter.
          Col.Landa closes the door behind him, and LOCKS IT.
          Bridget notices, but says nothing.
          Now the two Germans are alone.COL.LANDAHave a seat fraulein.
          Pointing at one lone chair in front of the desk.
          She lowers herself in the chair.
          Instead of moving around to the other side of the desk,
          opposite her. The SS Colonel pulls another little chair over,
          and places it in front of the fraulein.
          He sits. Their knees almost touching.
          The colonel points to the foot not in the cast.COL.LANDA(GERMAN)Let me see your foot.BRIDGET(GERMAN)I beg your pardon?1 31Patting his lap.COL.LANDAPut your foot in my lap.BRIDGETColonel, you embarrass me.COL.LANDAI assure you fraulein, my intention
          is not to flirt.
          Patting his lap more with more aggression.
          The nervous fraulein, lifts up her strapy dress shoe enclosed
          foot, and places it in the Colonel's lap.
          The Colonel, very delicately, unfastens the thin straps that
          hold the frauleins shoe on her foot...
          .He removes the shoe...
          .Leaving only the frauleins bare foot...THEN...He removes from his heavy SS coat pocket, the pretty dress shoe
          the fraulein left behind at La Louisiane...
          He slips it on her foot...
          .it fits like a glove.
          Bridget knows she's BUSTED.
          Col.Landa smiles and says in ENGLISH;COL.LANDAWhat's that American expression...
          "if the shoe fits...you must wear it".
          He removes her foot from his lap.BRIDGET(GERMAN)What now Colonel?COL LANDA(GERMAN)Do you admit you treachery?
          She stares defiant daggers into him.1314BRIDGET(GERMAN)The only thing I will admit to, is

          Von Hammersmarks lily white delicate neck, and with all the
          violence of a Lion in mid-pounce, SQUEEZES with all his MIGHT.
          Bridgets face turns tomato RED, as the VEINS in her face
          BULGE, and her esophagus is CRUSHED in his GRIP.
          With a violent YANK, he JERKS her TO THE FLOOR. She TUMBLES
          out of the chair, Landa never releasing his GRIP around her
          throat. Nov fully on top of her, he BEARS DOWN, SQUEEZING THE
          VERY LIFE OUT OF HER. Every thing he has, he brings to bear on
          the elegant ladies neck.
          Then, to finally finish her off, he begins BANGING THE BACK OFHER HEAD, HARD AGAINST THE FLOOR...BANG!BANG!BANG?She's dead.
          He releases the grip around her throat. His hands areTREMBLING...He rises.
          Strangling the very life out of somebody with your bear hands,
          is the most violent act a human being can commit.
          Also, only humans strangle, the opposable thumbs being quite
          important part of the endeavor. As Hans Landa stands, the
          sheer violence he had to call on to accomplish this task,
          still surges through him. He tries to gain control of the
          trembling, that is rippling through his body. He takes out a
          silver SS FLASK(filled with peach schnapps), and knocks back
          a couple of swigs. He holds his hand out in front of him. The
          TREMBLING is beginning to subside. He picks up the telephone.139-Into the phone in German he says;COL.LANDAInform The Fuhrer the audience has
          taken there seats, and we're ready

          SIDE ROOM ...A PILE of over300nitrate FILM PRINTS, lay like a
          junk pile, right behind the screen.
           Sitting down in a wooden chair facing the screen, and
           Pile-o-film, he lights up a cigarette, a absolute no-no in a
           cinema of this era, but tonight, what does it matter?4.
           He smokes, and waits for his cue to... .BURN IT DOWN!)53.FREDRICK IN OPERA BOXalong side Hitler, Goebbels, Francesca, and BOORMAN. On screen
          the battle rages. He leans over and whispers something in
          Goebbels ear, we can't hear. Goebbels makes a very sympathetic
          face (at least sympathetic for Goebbels), and says in German;GOEBBELSPerfectly understandable, dear boy.
          You go now, and we'll see you after
          the show.
          He exits the opera box. And walks to the projection booth
          door. He raps on the door in a trying to be amusing way.
          The door opens, just a little bit, Shosanna not friendly,
          stares at him.
          Be, as per usual, is all smiles and charm.
          They speak in FRENCH, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;FREDRICKAre you the manager, of this cinema?
          I want my money back. That actor in
          the movie stinks.
          He laughs.IVShe doesn't even smile. She says, in all serious business;SHOSANNAWhat are you doing here?FREDRICKI came to visit you.SHOSANNACan't you see how busy I am?FREDRICKThen allow me to lend a assist.SHOSANNAFredrick it's not funny, you can't
          be here. This is your premiere, you
          need to be out there with them.
          As Fredrick prepares to tell his little tale, with all the
          charm at his command, Shosanna listens, knowing the third reel
          is just about over, and her big reel change is coming up.FREDRICKNormally, you would be.right.
          And for all the other films I do,
          I intend to endure evenings like
          tonight, in the proper sprit.
          However the fact remains, this film,
          is based on my military exploits.
          And in this case, my exploits
          consisted of me killing many men.
          Consequently, the part of the film
          that's playing now,... .I don't like
          watching this part.SHOSANNAFredrick, I am sorry, but -FREDRICK- So, I thought, I'd come up here
          and do what I do best, annoy you.

          would appear I haven't lost my touch.DONNY IN TOILETSgt.Donowitz, with BOMB in his lap, sets the timer, six

          No subtitles for Fredrick needed this time, he gets it.
          He does a one-armed PILE DRIVE PUSH on the door, knocking both
          it OPEN, and Shosanna back into the room.
          Fredrick, a different cat then we've seen up till now, enters
          the booth, closing the door behind him, and LOCKING it.
          The quite startled Shosanna, says to Fredrick;SHOSANNAFredrick, you hurt me.FREDRICKWell, it's nice to know you can feel
          something. Even if it's just physical
          pain.

          Shosanna steps backwards...FREDRICKI'm not a man you say, "Go away"
