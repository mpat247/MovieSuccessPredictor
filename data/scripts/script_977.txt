          The real Bob Costas does narration.BOB COSTAS (V.0.)Before the NBA was the NBA, there
          was another basketball league in
          America...
          DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: This is real ABA footage. A series of
          great plays are made by ABA stars.BOB COSTAS (V.0.).From 1967 to 1976, there was the
          American Basketball Association. A
          maverick minor-league that would
          change the game forever. The ABA
          made the fast break FAST...
          Invented the three point shot...
          And introduced the world to
          something called the Slam Dunk
          Contest.
          DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: Dr. J launches from the foul line and
          dunks in the world's first dunk contest. David Thompson
          finishes an Alley Oop.BOB COSTAS (V.0.)Singer Pat Boone owned the Oakland
          Oaks. Wilt Chambelain coached the
          Conquistadors. I myself was the
          young voice of the St. Louis
          Spirits.
          DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: A young Bob Costas broadcasts from St.
          Louis, looking pretty sweet in side burns and a tweed jacket.BOB COSTAS (V.O.)Players like Dr. J, Ice-man George
          Gervin and Moses Malone were as
          entertaining as they come. But
          despite the league's flair,
          convincing fans to show up for
          games was often a struggle.
          DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: The infamous TV interview where Freddy
          Lewis wins a 'race horse.' Footage of 'Dime Beer Night.'
          Footage of the Kentucky Colonials fielding a cheerleader as
          one of their starting five.2.BOB COSTAS (V.0. )For owners, promotional ideas
          became an art form all to
          themselves.
          DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: The Miami Ball Girls dance in bikinis
          (In truth, some of the girls were still in high school).BOB COSTAS (V.0.)One night, the Nets went as far as
          to give a free gerbil to it's first
          fifty fans... There were plenty of
          punches too, giving the National
          Hockey League a run for it's money.
          DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: A guy elbows Connie Hawkins, who turns
          and punches the guy in the face.BOB COSTAS (V.0.)Yes, the ABA had a style all it's
          own. The hair was big, the shorts
          were short and the ball was red,
          white and blue.
          DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: Harry 'The fat Mexican guy' dances.BOB COSTAS (V.0.)In 1976, rumors of a merger spread
          throughout the league. In the end,
          only four teams would join the NBA
          and survive.QUICK CUTS: THE PACERS. THE NUGGETS. THE NETS. THE SPURS.BOB COSTAS (V.0.)Teams like the Kentucky Colonels
          and the Virginia Squires would
          disappear forever. But their spirit
          still lives on to this day.EXT. A BASKETBALL STADIUM - 1976We hear a crowd going crazy.BOB COSTAS (V.0.)Here, we present the legend of the
          ABA... Exactly as it happened.

          his beer and throws some guacamole.
          The crowd screams and curses at MONIX, mid 40'S -- talented,
          but past his prime. (There are three leading characters in
          this movie. This is the old rock. Think Nolte in 48 hours.
          Cosner in Durham. Newman in Slap Shot).LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)The Amigos are up by one here.

          MONIX suddenly takes a HUGE HIT, TOTALLY SLAMMED by a big

          Still stuck in the crowd. Monix struggles to get back on the

          slapping him. The crowd is nuts.4.DRUNK LADYHey Monix, want a sip?

          face.DRUNK LADY(smart ass)
          Oops.
          She and her friends laugh. Monix says nothing. Instead, he
          holds his aching back and limps up to the foul line, annoyed.PATRELLI(SMILING)Sorry, Monix, I got pushed.LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)Well, it looks like the Amigos are
          in trouble here. Monix is a ninety
          percent shooter, if he can hit both
          of these free throws, it's over.
          Monix performs his ancient free throw ritual: Three dribbles
          and a quick spin of the ball. But he MISSES.DRUNK LADYHA. NICE SHOT MONIX! YOU FUCKIN'SUCK, MAN! YOU SUCK DONKEY DICK.Again, Monix ignores the drunk lady.LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)They dodged a bullet there. But
          Monix still has one last chance to
          tie it up.
          Monix focuses on his ritual again.DRUNK LADYWHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? SHOOT THEBALL YOU PUSSY!Monix aims at the basket, about to shoot, but then suddenlyWHIPS THE BALL HARD AT THE LADY, PEGGING HER IN THE FACE.DRUNK LADYAHH!LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)(re: nailing the girl)

          wide.5.LOU REDWOOD (V.0.)Yes! He just pegged a chick! That's
          the greatest thing I've ever seen.
          The lady runs on court and attacks Monix, her boyfriend jumps
          in -- Monix hits her boyfriend with some quick hockey
          punches. The benches clear, everyone is punching everybody.LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)(re: violent fist fight)

          Championship ring necklace off.
          He looks at the ring in his hand... And shoves it into his
          duffle bag.CLARENCE (O.S.)I brought us some ice.

          Monix ignores this. Laying back, he focuses on the TV: THE
          CELTICS are playing. Their trapping defense is a thing of
          beauty.

          at 'Love American Style.'MONIXYou turned off the Celtics?CLARENCEI don't watch people play

          The way I see it, any team in this
          league can put together a run. Most
          of our opponents are all flash. If
          we play unselfish, fundamental
          basketball, we can win games.JACKIE MOONI like it. Unselfish, guys.66.MONIXYes. Unselfish. Unselfish meaning
          tough team defense, full and half
          court traps, boxing your man out to
          help the team rebound.(BEAT)Unselfish means sprinting up the
          floor on every fast break NOT
          because you can get a DUNK -- and
          get your DICK SUCKED after the game
          -- but because if you sprint up the
          floor you might pull the defense
          out of position and free a teammate
          up for a high percentage shot.JACKIE MOONWait, so, what's going on with the

          Clarence jogs over and stands next a scout team opponent.MONIXOkay, that's kind of a pick, I
          guess. Try standing on the other
          side of Scootsie's man, so you free
          him up to cut into the lane.
          Monix corrects Clarence, moving his body the way he wants him
          to stand.MONIXWiden your stance. Plant your feet.
          Hands back. Like this. Now Scootsie
          GO. Set a pick for Jackie.

          the team move just like in practice. Monix is playing too.
          Note: The team also looks 'hot.' Clarence plays with an even
          bigger afro. Jackie Moon sports a large perm, striped tube

          We look for the easy pass, not the
          spectacular pass...
          Jackie rolls off the pick and looks for it. For the first
          time in this sequence, we see the ball. Clarence has a clear
          passing lane -- He feeds Jackie for a lay up.74.MONIX (V.O.). If a guy's more open than you
          are, he gets the ball...
          Instead of celebrating, Clarence hustles back on Defense. The
          Tropics execute a half court trap. As we watch Monix play, we
          continue to the voice over from practice...MONIX (V.0.).On defense, we're going to learn
          to play together. We're going to
          use team traps to pressure people

          On the in bounds, Monix and Jackie Moon trap an opponent.
