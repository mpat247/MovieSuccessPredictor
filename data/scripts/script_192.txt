BLAST FROM THE PAST - by Bill Kelly and Hugh WilsonFADE IN:SCENE 1 OMITTEDEXT. SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - NIGHTOPEN on a MOVING WIDE SHOT of a mountain range with the
       distant lights of the San Fernando Valley behind it.
       BEGIN CREDITS as a NAVY JET drops down into the picture.
       PUSH IN on the jet's exhaust flame. Have the words "THE
       BLAST" come out of the flame. Then there is a SLIGHT
       EXPLOSION and the flame intensifies. The words "FROM THE
       PAST" jump out of the exhaust as the jet momentarily
       shakes.INT. JETThe PILOT feels the jet shake. But he looks at his
       indicators and everything appears to be normal. He
       relaxes.EXT. JETWe begin with a WIDER REAR SHOT of the jet and allow the
       plane to move away. Then SUPER: "LOS ANGELES, 1962"
       before continuing the main titles. A popular recording
       from that period has been playing throughout.EXT. CALVIN'S WORK SHOP - NIGHTStart on a CU of the HAM RADIO ANTENNA, WIND GAUGE and
       THERMOMETER attached to the roof of Calvin's shop. (We
       can hear military air traffic chatter on Calvin's
       Hallicrafter radio.) Then move down to the window where
       we see CALVIN Webber tinkering with a gadget at his work
       bench. Calvin's very pregnant wife HELEN appears. The
       music becomes source.HELENFor Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got
                 guests!CALVINSorry, honey!  I just got to fooling
                 with this darn rheostat.HELENWell, put it down and come in!CALVINYou bet, hon!

       They exit the workshop for the house.  Calvin has left
       the ham radio on.NAVY PILOT (ONRADIO)Tower, Wolf One is five miles from the

       favors June Allison.HELENHi, Betty!  Dave!BETTYJust look at you!HELENAny day now!BETTYThis is my sister and her husband.HELENOh, hi! Welcome!INT. LIVING ROOMCalvin is using a cocktail shaker to very carefully make
       Rob Roys for the crowd at the bar. It's like watching a
       chemist at work. Calvin's a pipe-smoker.CALVINSo anyhow this duck says to the clerk,
                 "I'd like to buy this lip balm."  And
                 the clerk says, "Will that be cash or
                 a check?"  And the duck says, "Just
                 put it on my bill!"

       Polite laughter follows, but the guy out of Calvin's
       sight-line rolls his eyes.ANGLE - DAVE AND BOBwith drinks. Helen is in the b.g., rushing around, over-
       serving everyone.DAVEHe was the golden-boy professor at Cal

       the window.BETTYWith all his money they could have
                 moved to Beverly Hills, but they
                 decided to stay in the Valley.  Calvin
                 spends all his time tinkering out
                 there in his workshop.  If you ask me
                 it's all very strange.WOMAN GUEST #1(chiming in)
                 He dug a huge hole out there for a
                 swimming pool. Then he decided he
                 didn't want it and filled the thing
                 in. And what's that big, high fence
                 for?

       The women look at Calvin.ANGLE - CALVINwith guests (one is called Harold) at the bar.CALVINThere currently exists a type of neon

                 to station strategic weapons for the
                 first time outside of Soviet soil, is
                 a deliberately provocative and
                 unjustified change in the status quo
                 which cannot be accepted by this
                 country.

       Calvin cuts a knowing look at Helen who dutifully returns
       it.EXT. JET - NIGHTThe plane swoops over the Valley and we see the
       spectacular lights of L.A. sprawl.  There is a TRAIL OF

                 must be faced.INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT/ EXT. HOUSE, MOMENTS LATERTo Helen's embarrassment, Calvin is ushering  all the
       guests to the front door. Helen is passing out hats and
       purses. She and Calvin speak simultaneously - somewhere
       in the middle we cut outside.CALVINI'm sorry everyone, but given this
                 extraordinary turn of events, I think
                 it's prudent that we cut the evening
                 short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will
                 resolve itself, but in the
                 meantime...I'd suggest taking a
                 prayerful watch-and-wait stance!HELENWe'll do this again! Maybe next week.

                 be all right. I just know it is!EXT. BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATERCalvin and Helen leave the house; cross the patio; and
       hurry to the shop. Back in the house, the record player
       has been left on:  "How Much Is That Doggie In The
       Window...?"  Helen is carrying the pot roast which is
       wrapped in foil.HELENWell, I'm certainly not going to let
                 the pot roast go to waste. Could you
                 just put that seat cover back on that

       The SOUND OF THE TRAINER JET makes a low pass over
       Calvin's house.  Calvin sticks his head out the door and
       looks up.CALVINI bet that's a fighter jet on his way

       Calvin unplugs the radio and quickly wraps the cord.CALVINWe can listen to the rest downstairs!

       He pushes aside a table that is hiding a hatch in the
       floor and unlocks it by turning the hatch's wheel.  Then
       he opens the hatch and reaches inside to turn on a light.
       Red submarine light shines up from below.  All the while
       he and Helen are chatting:HELENCalvin, I wish you would have at least
                 let me do the dishes. It's not going
                 to be that easy getting all that dried-

       begins to FALL DIRECTLY BACK TO EARTH, tail first.INT. SMALL ANTEROOM - SAME TIMEThe Webbers step off a metal ladder and face a vault-like
       chrome hatchway.  Calvin opens the six-inch thick door by
       pushing another switch on his small box. Helen takes the

       Calvin flicks a wall switch and we HEAR A SERIES OF
       LIGHTS COMING ON.  The echoes of the sounds suggest a
       large, cavernous space.  All we can see is the cinder
       block wall behind them and the hatch door, which Calvin
       begins to shut by putting his body into it.

       Just then there is a TREMENDOUS DOUBLE EXPLOSION FROM
       ABOVE which knocks them to the floor. (Note: Helen hangs
       on to the roast, trying her best not to drop it.) TheLADDER, CORRUGATED TUBE, ROOF, AND LOTS OR DIRT AND ROCKBEGIN TO CRASH DOWN INTO THE ANTEROOM. Calvin struggles

       Hanging on to the roast she nods vigorously, trying to be
       brave.HELENYes, I think so.

       Calvin hurries to a bright RED METAL BOX on the wall.
       Next to the box is a LARGE THERMOMETER OR GAUGE that's
       labeled "Radiation Count."  There are OTHER GAUGES that

       window and a "For Sale or Rent" sign.  There's ANOTHER
       SHOP attached to it CAMERA RIGHT but we can't see what it

       The Other Bum staggers to his feet and SPLITS for a back
       window.  Soda Jerk is fearless.  Until finally the
       HYDRAULIC DOORS of the back entrance SPLIT THE FLOOR with
       an eerie, struggling whine and LARGE CHUNKS OF CEMENT GO
       FLYING.  Then up comes RED SUBMARINE LIGHT followed by
       Calvin in his BIG YELLOW SUIT with Geiger counter
       ticking.SODA JERKOh, God!  Oh, God!!  Oh,God, save me!!

       Calvin raises his hand and yells through his mask.CALVINI come in peace!!

       The Soda Jerk FAINTS. Calvin, sounding like a deep sea
       diver and having to walk like Frankenstein, goes over to
       the Soda Jerk and studies his face in the light of his
       flashlight.  He is horrified by what he sees.CALVINMy, gosh...

       Calvin looks around the room and heads for the back.  He
       moves his Geiger counter around and gets a quiet (safe)
       reading. Then he removes a KITCHEN MATCH from a plastic
       container and strikes it against the wall.  The MATCH
       BURNS, so Calvin takes off his hood and visor and
       breathes the air.  It stinks in there.EXT. MALT SHOP - MOMENTS LATER, RAININGCalvin (out of the head gear and top of the suit) slowly
       pushes the door open and steps out. He's surprised to
       find an empty BODY SHOP behind the Malt Shop, where the
       avocado trees should be.CALVINWhere is my backyard?

       He points his flashlight around and heads for the ALLEY
       to his left.EXT. ALLEY - A MOMENT LATER, RAININGDERELICT CARS left over from the Body Shop sit against a
       fence. Calvin marvels at the cars, even in their present
       condition.  In a TIGHTER SHOT he studies the chrome-
       plated word "Toyota."   A HOMELESS MAN arrives to search
       through the garbage. Calvin hurries back towards the
       avenue.SCENE 76 OMITTEDEXT. MALT SHOP - TEN MINUTES LATER, RAINCalvin emerges from the alley that separates the Malt
       Shop from another storefront (perhaps now a rundown Thai

                 light!STREET WALKERGood.

       one of his kitchen matches.CALVINSo...you...survived the blast, did
                 you?STREET WALKERThe blast?  Honey, I have survived a
                 host of things. Like the song says: "A

       He breaks into a trot, heading up the street past a seedy
       BAR (used to be the convenience store) just as a
       hopelessly DRUNK HAG of a woman is shoved out and told to
       stay out.  Calvin watches as the woman stumbles to the
       curb where she TOSSES her cookies.  TWO LOW RIDERS HOP BY
       full of TAUNTING YOUNG HISPANIC GANG MEMBERS, one of whom
       BRANDISHES A PISTOL and, just for fun, points it at
       Calvin.  When Calvin sees the pistol he ducks into the
       ADULT BOOKSTORE. The young gang member pulls the trigger
       and we (not Calvin) see that the realistic-looking pistol
       is really a water gun.INT. ADULT BOOK AND VIDEO STORECalvin races in and, gathering himself, addresses the
       PAKISTANI MAN behind the counter.CALVINHello!  How are you this evening?!
                 Mind if I, you know, browse around?!

       The clerk just watches him.CALVINThank-Q very much!

       Then Calvin turns and has his first look at the
       material...and he GRABS HIS HEART and SCREAMS and FALLS
       back KNOCKING OVER a whole ROW OF VIDEOS AND MAGAZINES.INT. SHELTER, KITCHEN - AN HOUR LATERCalvin sits at the breakfast table, still breathing hard
       and holding his chest.  His family looks on with great
       concern.  The anti-radiation suit and gear is piled in
       the corner.CALVINI'm going to give it to you straight.
                 There's no point in beating around the
                 bush. There were survivors.
                 Apparently,
                 the fallout has created....a
                 subspecies of mutants.HELENMutants?!CALVINIt's not a pretty sight. Some eat out
                 of garbage cans.  Others are...cover

       Helen copes by moving around the kitchen doing things

       takes Adam's arm and the son drops his hands and stops
       humming.CALVINThey've done a lot of re-building but
                 society, at least as we knew it, has

                 the streets. Others point guns.
                 There's something terribly wrong with

       see Calvin sleeping in his bed. She heads for the living
       room. He follows.HELENHe seems to be doing all right now.  I
                 don't know if he's had a heart attack

                 things to get us through the next year
                 or two.  And you'll find most of these
                 items at what used to be called a

                 Write that down.ADAMYes, ma'am.

       At the fish tank, Helen pulls up a slim chain that is
       attached to a water-tight aluminum box which she quickly
       opens. The box contains $6,000 in wrapped one hundred
       dollar bills. Helen takes half of it.HELENI don't know how far you'll have to
                 travel to find supplies, but if you
                 can't get home by nightfall, I want

       They have stopped by the garden.HELENOh, Adam,that would be wonderful if

       Adam, who drops his ear close to his father's lips.CALVINAdam...don't forget...don't forget ...ADAMYes, father?! Yes?CALVIN...the pipe tobacco.ADAMYes, sir.  Is that all?

       Calvin nods. Adam rises and starts for the door. But

       around the broken cement.  Currently he's on his knees,
       rocking back and forth as he prays.

       And,lo! There came a rumbling even as from the very
       bowels of the earth and a great light showed forth
       followed by gates of armor which opened and shut and
       delivered up the vision of a young man whose countenance
       caused the Soda Jerk to be struck dumb and to fall on his
       face and to weep in fear.  And, Adam, taking pity on the
       man, put down his suitcase, and went to him, saying:ADAMAre you all right?SODA JERKYes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes!

       attention. It's an ADULT BOOKSTORE much like the last one
       we saw (probably owned by the same chain.) He's happy but
       when he looks next door he sees he's in a different
       place. Sad and lost he turns north and starts to walk
       until -- a billboard catches his attention. We pan up to
       see a billboard for liposuction that features an almost

                 hundred dollar bills and I need

       of the store and her back is momentarily to us.EVE (OC)Oh, shit!

       Adam turns to her and is immediately awe struck. We
       reveal EVE RUSTOKOV. She tosses her lipstick into her
       purse. Eve works in the card shop and is on her way out.JERRYI'm workin' here, Evey-poo.  Don't

       She walks back to the counter to get her coat.JERRYOh, no! I fired ya! Just like the hair

       Cliff steps up to the table.  Adam, automatically a
       gentleman, rises and offers his hand.ADAMHello, Cliff, how are you this
                 evening?

       Cliff barely shakes his hand.CLIFFNot bad.

       Then he sits in Adam's seat.CLIFFBut I do miss that green sport coat of

                 Sure.

       They rise.  Cliff gestures to the chair.CLIFFIt's all yours.

       Eve and Cliff go to the bar.  Adam sits down glumly.  He
       looks across the room and catches the eye of Miss Sweet
       who is seated at a table with Heather.  A GOOD LOOKING
       GUY is hitting on them.  CUTTING BACK AND FORTH between
       Adam and them we see Miss Sweet's smile escalate.  Then
       she nudges Heather who also looks over and smiles. Adam
       smiles back.  Finish with a CLOSER SHOT OF HIS POV of
       Miss Sweet's hair, butt and legs.ANGLE - BAREve and Cliff are in cozy conversation at the bar.

       He gives Adam a shove.ADAMCliff, I must warn you. I know how to
                 defend myself.CLIFFDo ya?

       Cliff throws a right which Adam calmly blocks and
       counters with a short right jab to Cliff's mouth,
       snapping his head back.  It's not a big punch, but very,
       very quick. It makes Eve mad and astonishes Troy, Jason
       and Jonathan.EVEStop it, you two!CLIFF(slightly insecure)
                 I guess we shouldn't fight in here.ADAM(lowering his guard)
                 Yes, I agree.

       Cliff draws back another right.  Adam flicks out a quick
       left to Cliff's cheek, again snapping his head back, but
       not his body. (These aren't big movie hits.) Cliff takes
       a beat or two then draws back his right fist again.  Adam
       pops him in the nose. Cliff drops his right arm to his
       side.EVEAdam?!ADAMI'm sorry.CLIFF(increasingly insecure)
                 Maybe we shouldn't fight at all.
                 Fighting is pretty immature.ADAM(lowering his guard)
                 It certainly is.  I agree with you

                 Eve, I'm sorry.

       Seeing an opportunity, Cliff rears back with another
       right. Adam deftly pops him in the mouth again with a
       short right jab.CLIFF(deeply insecure)
                 Well, good night, everyone.

       Troy, Jonathan and Jason say good night to him.  Cliff
       walks unsteadily away bleeding from the mouth and both
       nostrils. (Hopeful that no one has noticed that he's very
       subtly just gotten the crap beat out of him.)EVEI'm leaving, too.ADAMBut, Eve, I would--EVEAnd tomorrow maybe Troy will help you

                 You know, I asked him about that. And
                 he said that good manners are a way we
                 have of showing other people that we
                 respect them. See, you'd eat like a
                 slob if you
                 were alone, but since another human
                 being is present, you show that person
                 respect by going to the trouble of
                 having proper manners. I didn't know
                 that. I thought it was a way of
                 appearing superior.

                 the short and very simple definition
                 of a gentleman or a lady is: someone
                 who always attempts to make the people
                 around him or her feel as comfortable
                 as possible. That's it! If you don't
                 do that, nothing else matters. The
                 cars, the clothes, the houses...EVEWhere did he get all that information?TROYFrom the oddest place. His parent's
                 told him. I don't think I got that

                 driver to drop me here instead of at
                 the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como

                 high-- knowing I'm--on the street--
                 where you live."  It's about a young

       During the following speech CAMERA pushes past him and
       lingers on her as she gradually realizes that Adam is

                 In 1962, when the bomb was dropped on
                 Los Angeles, my parents were in our
                 fallout shelter.  That's where I was
                 born. We
                 only survived because it was a huge
                 shelter as fallout shelters go. My
                 father worked on it secretly for
                 years. When he had to, he used
                 contractors, but always from out-of-
                 state and always for just a portion of
                 the job. He told them it was a secret
                 government experiment done through
                 CalTech. My Dad's not a liar, but he
                 felt in this case he had no choice. Of
                 course, it had to be a secret, because
                 we had just enough supplies to last
                 three people thirty-five years. That's
                 also why I have no brothers or
                 sisters. The air vent was the really
                 tricky part, but he was able to cut
                 into a flood control sewer. What I'd
                 like to do Eve, is take you down into
                 the fallout shelter with me. We could
                 live there with my Mom and Dad. My dad
                 said if I found a healthy girl I
                 should "bring her on down". And you
                 look plenty healthy to me.EVEUh-huh. Adam?ADAMYes, Eve?EVEI want you to go back to the hotel
                 now.  I'll call you a cab.ADAMOf course.  I shouldn't be over here
                 at this hour.

       He rises.  She gets up and leads him to the door.EVEThat's right.  And I'll see you in the
                 morning in the lobby.  Do you mind
                 waiting outside for the taxi?ADAMNot at all.  And Eve thank you for
                 tonight...and for the kiss. My first.EVEMy pleasure.ADAMIt was at least as good as the sky.EVEReally?  Okay!ADAMAnd I think better than the ocean. I'm

       They hug.

                           HELEN (cont'd)
                 Calvin!  They're married!CALVIN(offering his hand to both)
                 That's wonderful. We Webber guys have
                 mighty good luck when it comes to
                 women.

       Calvin points out the computer.

                           CALVIN (cont'd)
                 What's that thing?ADAMIt's kind of a combination television-
                 typewriter-telephone-post office type
                 of thing.
                     (leading Calvin out)
                 I'll show it to you later.EXT. PATIO - AN HOUR LATERAdam and Calvin exit the house. They wear baseball gloves
       and start playing catch. (Calvin notes the modern
       construction of his glove, but does not comment on it.)CALVINThis is great son, just great. By the
                 way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov,
                 that's not Russian, is it?ADAMIt's Ukrainian. Her grandparents
                 immigrated here.CALVINUh-huh.ADAMDad, I don't know how to tell you
                 this. And I was going to wait a while,
                 but I think...Dad,there was no bomb.
                 A plane crashed into our backyard. I
                 looked it up in old newspapers.CALVIN(after a while)
                 You're sure?ADAMPositive. The Soviet Union collapsed
                 without a shot being fired. The Cold
                 War is over.CALVINThat's what everybody believes?ADAMYes, sir. It's true.CALVINWhat? Did the politburo just one day
                 say - "We give up?"ADAMYes. That's kind of how it was.CALVINUh-huh.

       Adam throws the ball, but Calvin makes no attempt to
       catch it.CALVINMy gosh, those Commies are brilliant!
                 You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we
                 didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our
                 evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor
                 us!"  I bet they've even asked the
                 West for aid!  Right?!ADAMUh, I think they have.CALVINHah!!! Those cagey rascals! Those sly
                 dissemblers! Those, uh...
                     (he can't think of another
                      description, so he moves on)
                 They've finally pulled the wool over
                 everybody's eyes!EVE (VO)Have you ever in your life seen a son
                 who did more for his parents?

       Helen comes out with a tray of champagne cocktails.EVE (VO)Adam says that this is simply how
                 things work.  First the parents take
                 care of the children and then the
                 children take care
                 of the parents. He says historically,
                 that's how it works.INT. LIVING ROOMEve and Troy are sitting by the window.  Adam and Helen
       come in to offer cocktails to Troy and Eve.EVE (VO)Whenever Adam gives me such obviously
                 incorrect information, I just smile,
                 slap him on the knee, and look out the
                 window.
                 Why spoil his dreams?  They're such
                 wonderful dreams.

       The CAMERA wanders off of them and shoots out the glass
       doors. We see Calvin behind the house...measuring off the
       dimensions for a fallout shelter.EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUSCalvin continues to measure as we pull way back and up.
