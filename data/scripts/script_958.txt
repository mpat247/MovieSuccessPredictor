S. DARKOWritten byNathan AtkinsSecond draftEXT. WHEAT FIELD - MORNINGSAMANTHA DARKO (18) opens her eyes. She squints as the summer
          sun shrinks her pupils to pinhole size. She sits up slowly,
          looks around... and finds herself in midst of an endless
          wheat field.Sam is pretty and demure. Her coppery hair flows past her
          shoulders. Disoriented, she stands and gazes at the infinite
          golden shimmer. Amber waves of grain. Patches of forest in
          the distance. It's quiet. Serene. Beautiful...She smiles, and starts walking.EXT. ARKANSAS HIGHWAY 40 - MORNINGShe emerges at the shoulder of a rural stretch of highway in
          Arkansas. Adjacent to her position, on the other side of the
          deserted lanes, is a TRUCK STOP.EXT. TRUCK STOP - MORNINGAmongst the TRACTOR-TRAILERS parked in the back lot is a

          driver's seat of the car. She awakens when Sam gets in on the
          passenger side and slams the door shut.Corey has the look of a typical rebellious teen: dyed hair,
          piercings, a little grungy. She rubs the sleep from her eyes,
          greeting the new day with something less than enthusiasm. She
          finds a soft pack of CIGARETTES and lights one.COREYWhat time is it?SAMEarly...Corey adjusts her seat. She takes a long drag and chokes,
          then spits out the window. She starts the car...2.I/E. COREY'S CHEVROLET/HIGHWAY 40, VARIOUS - DAYCorey's car cruises along the flat, open road. She cranks up
          the VOLUME on the car's CASSETTE DECK, nodding her head to
          early-90s ALT. ROCK (suggestion: Into Dust, by Mazzy Star)...Sam looks out the window at the passing scenery: FARMERS at
          work in the fields; a BILLBOARD advertising a local
          restaurant; ROADSIDE DITCHES filled with trash...She fixates on a MINIVAN travelling in the slow lane. It
          contains the all-American NUCLEAR FAMILY: MOTHER, FATHER and
          three SIBLINGS, one of them being a YOUNGSTER. The Youngster
          makes a face at Sam as they pass by...INT. COREY'S CHEVROLET - LATER - DAYCorey glances at the CONTROL PANEL when she HEARS the engine

          steam billows out from under the hood. Sam gets out of the
          car to check on it while Corey remains behind the wheel.Sam peeks under the hood, trying to clear the air of the
          steam. It sounds like someone is rhythmically TAPPING the
          inside of the engine with a hammer.SAMTurn it off.COREY(poking her head out theWINDOW)What?SAMTurn off the car.Corey does so.SAM (CONT'D)Doesn't look too good...COREYHow do you know?3.SAMIt smells funny.Sam looks up when she HEARS a PICK-UP TRUCK coming toward
          them. Corey watches as she steps out to wave it down...The pick-up pulls over ahead of them. CHRIS HOLT (24), a
          brawny, attractive young man, gets out. When Corey sees him

          garage attached to his old two-story house. Corey's car has
          been towed there, and DUSTY GIBBENS (37; father of Ruth
          Gibbens), the lone mechanic, tinkers around under the hood.Sam and Corey sit on the front steps of the house waiting,

          when Ruth (from outside the liquor store) comes to the door.5.RUTHCan I get out?Sam and Corey move so that she can exit the house. Ruth's
          look is hardened, rough around the edges -- she appears older
          than her 18 years.The girls watch as she enters the garage to see her father.
          She whispers something in his ear, and Dusty hands her some
          CASH, which she pockets then kisses him on the cheek. After
          this, Dusty wipes his hands on his greasy jeans and comes
          outside to address Corey and Sam.DUSTYYeah... it's the water pump.COREYSo what do we do?DUSTYI can order you up a new one.

          in which Mike and Jeff ogle the girls mischievously. Ruth
          stares at them in a different way. She seems somewhat
          resentful of their presence.RUTHFrom Virginia, huh?COREYYep.RUTHI saw your plates...Corey and Sam both nod in mundane acknowledgment. Another

          JUNE 19, 1995... It changes again, this time to a countdown
          to the JULY 4TH FIREWORKS CELEBRATION: 15 DAYS, 17 HOURS, 29MINUTES, 57 SECONDS... 56 SECONDS... 55 SECONDS...INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHTSam awakens suddenly from a nightmare. She lies atop the
          blankets wearing a T-SHIRT and BOXER SHORTS. She looks over
          and sees Corey passed out on the other full-size bed.TWO PLASTIC CUPS, EMPTY SODA CANS, and the BOTTLE are on the
          nightstand between them, the liquor partially consumed.
          There's a digital CLOCK/RADIO that reads 3:30 AM.The TV is on, and a late night INFOMERCIAL for the GEORGE
          FOREMAN GRILL plays. Sam stares at the screen as the images
          WARP and RIPPLE in a way that coincides with an increasingly
          loud, rumbling TREMOR from outside...In a daze, she gets up and slowly walks closer to the
          television. She reaches out with her RIGHT HAND, about to
          touch it... A strange, abrupt HARD CUT TO:EXT. GRASSY FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - NIGHTSam is in a grassy field behind the motel, moving away from
          the building. She wears a HOODED SWEATSHIRT, JEANS, and her
          RIGHT HAND is wrapped in some sort of MAKESHIFT BANDAGE.9.There's a GASH in the side of her forehead by her temple,
          with what looks to be a SHARD OF METAL partially embedded
          under the skin and protruding from the wound.She is without expression, and her movements are rhythmic and
          fluid. A tall AERMOTOR WINDMILL towers in the distance...SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - THE GRASSY FIELDA glimpse of the field through Sam's eyes shows a
          phosphorescent PLANE OF DESTINY -- an intricate grid in which
          objects organic and inorganic dwell in assigned positions,
          and move according to a framework of set paths.A JACKRABBIT follows a silvery VECTOR SPEAR like prophetic
          life-gel to its burrow... COSMIC ENERGY burns around a
          CLUSTER OF STONES... Miniature VECTOR SPEARS lead a SWARM OF
          INSECTS around in a circle and then BUZZING right past Sam's
          field of vision...It's infinitely complex, but Sam sees through it clearly. She
          has no vector spear of her own to guide her, but she is
          cognizant of her path... She moves toward the WINDMILL.EXT. WINDMILL - NIGHTSam appears at the foot of the windmill tower. A giant WATER
          TANK squats beside it. Remaining stoic, she looks up and sees
          Vietnam Tom sitting atop the windmill platform, more than 30
          feet up, staring back down at her through the eyes holes of
          his ski mask...ANGLE: WINDMILL PLATFORMTom peers over the edge of the small platform, the surface of
          which is littered with TATTERED CLOTHING, a WATER BOTTLE,
          CANS OF FOOD and SCRAPS OF A TARP. He cradles a RIFLE in his
          arms...His focus shifts from what is at the foot of the windmill to
          what is sitting right beside him --REVEAL Sam. Her legs dangle over the side of the platform,
          and she stares off into distance.SAMThe sky's so beautiful here...Tom looks in the direction that she stares and then back at
          her. Sam turns to meet his gaze...10.SAM (CONT'D)But we can't stay.SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - VIETNAM TOMSam sees through to the core of his physical being, the
          DYNAMIC CENTER of which lingers pulsating in a translucent
          circle around his chest.Magnified NEURONS in TOM'S BRAIN send ELECTRIC IMPULSES that
          release NEUROTRANSMITTERS, which excite OTHER NEURONS...Tom slowly reaches out to touch Sam, but an invisible FORCE
          FIELD makes contact impossible. RIPPLES swell throughout the
          clear plasma-like barrier from where he touched it, and his
          hand remains glued to the spot.Sam extends her bandaged right hand, and presses it to
          Vietnam Tom's as if she were touching a mirrored image of
          herself.The contact generates more RIPPLES, and as TREMORS begin to
          shake the windmill a DISTORTED VOICE echoes throughout theCOSMOS:DISTORTED VOICE (V.O.)15 days... 18 hours... 45
                    minutes... 6 seconds. That is when
                    the world will end.A CYLINDRICAL PORTAL opens up below them, gaping and swirling
          like God's eye on the mouth of a liquid tornado. As Sam and
          Tom stand in unison to peer into it, a HEXAGONAL PLATE OF
          WHITE LIGHT emanates from within --EXT. BELOW WINDMILL - NIGHTThey appear near the foot of the windmill, sprinting away
          from it together. Tom has his rifle, and he looks up to the
          sky as he runs......there's a brilliant flash of GREEN LIGHT -- deafening
          THUNDER -- a blinding EXPLOSION --EXT. BUS STOP - MORNINGSam awakens to the morning sun blinding her. She struggles to
          peer through the harsh whiteness at a looming figure that
          stands over her. Her eyes adjust to discover that it's a
          policeman -- Officer O'Dell.11.OFFICER O'DELL`Fraid you can't sleep here, miss.Sam sits up and realizes she's on a bench at a bus stop near
          the side of the road. O'Dell's tone is innocuous, and when
          she looks up at him again she sees that he's grinning.OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)Got anyplace to be?Sam manages to find her voice.SAMThe motel.She takes his hand and rises.I/E. O'DELL'S CRUISER/MOTEL - MORNINGO'Dell's cruiser pulls into the motel parking lot, which is
          uncharacteristically full. A FIRE TRUCK is parked by the side
          of the road. Just then, a call comes in on the POLICE RADIO:DISPATCH (V.O.)We got some kinda situation at
                    Frank Haley's farm...OFFICER O'DELLCopy that. I'm here now...EXT. GRASSY FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - MORNINGWhere the towering windmill once stood is now only a CRATER
          about 5 feet deep and 10 feet in diameter, with charred bits
          of wood and metal strewn everywhere. GROUND WATER spurts from
          the broken WELL SEAL...And a cantaloupe-sized METEORITE sits in the center of the
          crater.Two FIREMEN haul out the meteorite with gloved hands as Sam
          and O'Dell arrive on the scene. Corey is already there
          looking on, as well as Chris Holt, who gave them a ride into
          town, Phil Coulter from the motel, and other local CITIZENS.

                    early this morning, alive and well.FRANK(SARCASTIC)Oh, well, thank heavens...Sam turns and peers up at the WATER TANK. It's marred by BURN
          MARKS and DENTS from the explosion. As she tilts her head and
          looks closer, she can almost pick out a shape created by the
          damage -- a negative image like the Shroud of Turin......in the form of a bizarre, toothy-grinned FACE OF A GIANTMONSTER BUNNY.13.EXT. MOTEL - MORNINGSam and Corey are on their way back to the motel room when
          they turn and see that Chris has followed them.CHRISHey...SAMHey.CHRISSo you guys stayed here last night?COREYOne of us did.Sam gives Corey a look.

          and hustles into the field toward the crash site.SAMWhat?Chris regains his train of thought:CHRISI was just gonna say, if you
                    wanted, I could give you a ride
                    back.He looks right at Sam when he says this. He then glances over
          at Corey, as if just remembering she was there.CHRIS (CONT'D)You too. I mean, I could give you
                    both a ride.14.COREYTo Middlesex, Virginia? Do you have

          food...Momentarily, someone else enters and takes a seat at the
          counter by their booth. It's Jeremy Frame, the driver of the
          BMW. He raises a finger to alert Ted of his presence.JEREMYJust a coffee, please.Ted nods and pours him a cup... After he receives his coffee,
          Jeremy turns and stares at the girls. They both notice him
          doing it, but Corey is the first to speak.COREYCan we help you?JEREMYNo, no... it's just that I
                    recognize you. I saw you by the
                    motel. Pretty amazing, huh?COREYI guess.JEREMYI just made a deal with Frank Haley

          munches on a french fry -- she's enjoying their conversation.JEREMY (CONT'D)I'm gonna study it. I'm a grad
                    student at Redlands... we've
                    actually got a pretty cool geology
                    lab there.Corey focuses on her lunch, ignoring him, but Jeremy goes on.JEREMY (CONT'D)I've gotta do some tests, but if I
                    had to guess, I'd say it's a
                    siderite. They're composed
                    primarily of iron and nickel.COREYHave fun.JEREMYMy name's Jeremy.COREYThat's nice.Sam glances up at Jeremy, expecting him to be hurt or
          embarrassed by Corey's snub. But he's not. He's smiling at
          her, and she can't help but smile back.EXT. FATHER HOMEIJER'S HOUSE/CHURCH - AFTERNOONEach licking an ICE CREAM CONE, Corey and Sam walk past the
          home of Father Homeijer. The priest is outside working in his
          flower garden, wearing his CLERICAL COLLAR. An old CATHOLIC
          CHURCH rests on the same lot as his house, looming behind it.When Father Homeijer sees the girls walking by, he rises from
          his work, takes off his gloves and wipes sweat from his
          forehead. Sam and Corey both notice him eyeballing them.COREYWhat's his problem?18.SAMJust keep walking.Corey waves to him in a sarcastic, exaggerated manner... The
          priest doesn't wave back, but continues to gawk at them until

          early teens to late-20s. On the back deck is a KEG OF BEER
          and a BOOMBOX blasting MUSIC. There's a slimy-looking POOL,
          and a few people swim in the greenish water.Randy and Ruth make their rounds as a pair. They stop off so
          Ruth can sell a BAG OF WEED to some eager KIDS. Corey and Sam
          hang with Mike and Jeff, drinking beer.COREYYou guys gotta come visit the club

                    doubt... right?SAMYeah. Definitely.Corey is relaxed, enjoying their newfound friends, while Sam
          appears more out of place. She drains the better part of her
          cup for some liquid courage.Randy and Ruth converge back on the group just as Officer
          O'Dell creeps into the backyard wearing plainclothes. Ruth
          notices him first.RUTHFuck.RANDYWhat?RUTHThat pig, O'Dell.20.RANDYDon't worry about Ryan. He might be
                    a cop, but he still likes to party.Randy's theory is proven when O'Dell takes a FLASK from his

          watches her, smirking.RANDYWe might as well all go in now,
                    we're already wet.RUTHGood idea...Without warning, Ruth shoves Sam backwards into the pool --ANGLE: BENEATH THE WATERShe sinks into the murky water in SLOW-MOTION. All SOUNDS are
          DROWNED OUT and everything is tranquil, completely detached.Through her blurred vision, Sam can see Randy's PORCH LIGHTS

          her up --She breaches the surface of the water, gasping for breath --
          back to reality. She sees that Randy is the one responsible
          for pulling her out.RANDYYou fall asleep down there?He, Ruth and the others are looking down at her, laughing.
          Sam is lost in thought, struck by her vision...She snaps out of it when she sees Corey tear off her top and
          jump into the pool beside her. Many of the PARTYGOERS hoot in
          approval, and Randy, Mike and Jeff strip down and leap in
          right behind her.Sam swims toward the far side of the pool where the steps
          are, and fewer people. When she arrives there, she's
          surprised to find Chris Holt waiting for her with a towel.CHRISThought you could maybe use this.As Chris hands her the towel, he notices a wide SCAR on the
          inside of Sam's RIGHT WRIST... but doesn't mention it. Sam
          wraps the towel around her sopping wet body.Corey looks over and sees her getting out...EXT. RANDY'S HOUSE, PORCH - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHTChris and Sam stand by the keg with fresh beers.CHRISSo what's so wrong at home that you

          alone. She can HEAR the PARTY going on in the backyard, but
          no one else is in sight.Still soaking wet, she plants herself on the stoop and starts
          to pound the rest of her drink...A strange, abrupt HARD CUT TO:EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF RANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHTSam lies in the middle of the street in front of Randy's. A
          lone, flickering STREET LIGHT intermittently bathes her in an
          orange glow.She is completely dry, wearing her HOODED SWEATSHIRT and
          JEANS, with the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE wrapped around her right
          hand. The SHARD OF METAL protrudes from the GASH in her
          forehead...A CAR suddenly screams right past her prostrate form, missing
          her by inches. She sits up slowly and looks toward the front
          of Randy's house, which is about 20 yards away.SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - DRUNK GUYSTwo DRUNK GUYS exit the house and enter the complex,
          phosphorescent grid that is Sam's field of vision. VECTOR
          SPEARS jut from their chests and precede all their movements
          as they open the gas tank of a PARKED CAR, insert a SIPHON,
          and begin to drain the gas into ANOTHER VEHICLE.DRUNK GUY #1Hurry up...Although she is close by, they take no notice of Sam
          whatsoever. ANOTHER CAR speeds by, again nearly crushing her,
          but she doesn't flinch...She stands, and turns deliberately to face the opposite side
          of the road where, unlike the Drunk Guys, there is someone
          who is completely focused on her -- Vietnam Tom crouches in a
          DITCH near a CULVERT --ANGLE: CULVERTSam appears with him in the tenebrous ditch. Tom stares at
          her wide-eyed through the eyeholes of his ski mask.25.From one end of the broad, open culvert they can see straight
          through to the other side...A PORTAL starts to take shape within, swirling around the
          circumference. Soft, BLUE LIGHT touches their faces from the
          phosphorescent glow, and a gust of WIND is nearly strong
          enough to make them falter.On the opposite end of the culvert, a PLATE OF WHITE LIGHT
          flashes for an instant then transforms into an image ofFATHER HOMEIJER'S CHURCH --EXT. CHURCH - NIGHTTom and Sam stand outside the church. The STEEPLE reigns over

          her in a daze, moving toward the PULPIT...Beside the ALTAR stand THREE BARE CROSSES in imitation of
          Calvary, each standing over 4 feet tall.Sam looks up to a HIGH CORNER, above the pulpit to the right,
          where two walls and the ceiling meet...SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - CONVERGENCE POINTThe three planes come together at an irregular angle, with
          the WALL ON THE RIGHT SIDE SLANTING INWARD, and the CEILINGSLOPING SLIGHTLY DOWNWARD.PHOSPHORESCENCE burns in the three queerly pitches lines,
          with a concentration of heightened energy at the juncture.A VECTOR SPEAR bulges from Vietnam Tom's chest where he
          stands below it, reaching higher and higher...As Tom's SPEAR gets closer to the convergence point, the
          BIZARRE ANGLING becomes more exaggerated because the planes
          start to DIP and SWELL with impossible elasticity --ANGLE: BETWEEN THE WALLSSam and Tom find themselves squeezed between the inner and

          passenger side window.COREYWhat happened to you?32.SAMWhat happened to me...? Where the
                    hell've you been?COREYI crashed at Randy's. We just got
                    food. Want a burger?SAMMy stomach's fucked up.JEFF                             MIKEAwww...                         Poor tummy...Jeff and Mike taunt her from the back. Ruth leers.SAM (CONT'D)We gotta talk about what we're
                    gonna do.COREYDon't worry about it so much.SAMThe motel guy came to the room this
                    morning all pissed off. We're
                    probably not even gonna have enough
                    money to pay for the car.Corey sighs, debating weather or not to get out. Before she
          can reach a decision, something in the department store's
          parking lot catches her eye: a LITTLE BOY with dark hair,
          wearing a BIRTHDAY HAT...But she blinks and he's gone, having disappeared between two
          parked vehicles.Confused, Corey rubs her eyes and gets out of the car.RANDYShould I wait a minute?JEFFWe gotta get some smokes...COREYJust go ahead. I'll catch up with
                    you later on.RANDYAlright. Later.Corey gets out and shuts the door. Randy speeds off toward an
          intersection about 20 yards ahead...33.INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOONChris is at work, stocking shelves inside the department
          store...He checks his watch, stops what he's doing and grabs a PACK
          OF CIGARETTES from his breast pocket -- time for a smoke
          break.EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOONSam and Corey meander toward the intersection where Randy's
          car is stopped at a red light.SAMWe just gotta figure out what we're
                    gonna do. I don't think-COREY(ABRUPT)Lemme guess, you wanna go home.SAMWhat?COREYYou wanna run back to mommy and
                    daddy and say sorry so they can put
                    you through college. Well that's
                    real big of you, Sam, but I don't
                    have that option.SAM(taken aback)
                    What are you talking about?COREYI'll go home and get the shit
                    kicked out of me, and get my ass
                    grabbed by my mom's boyfriend...They're almost to the light, which is still red, and coming
          up on Randy's car. Jeff, Mike and Ruth stare out at them from
          the backseat, smelling the drama.COREY (CONT'D)I knew you'd bail on me eventually,
                    but not this quick.SAMI'm not bailing on you. Would youJUST-34.COREYYou can fucking sleepwalk back to
                     Middlesex for all I care. I'm not
                     driving you... you're a fucking
                     drag.The light turns green, and Randy's car peels across the
          intersection, making a left...SAMFuck you, Corey.Sam wheels on her and steps out into the street, storming
          straight across. Corey starts to follow... but something
          stops her in her tracks: BILLY MOORCROFT.He stands on the opposite side of the intersection, in the
          trajectory that Sam is walking -- but Sam doesn't see him.Billy wears a BIRTHDAY HAT, SLACKS and COLLARED SHIRT. He
          looks pale and weak, and is covered with BRUISES. He stares
          right back at Corey, as transfixed as she is... TIME SLOWS
          DOWN. [Note: Sam's position is in the middle of the road.
          Randy's car has made the left but is still in the vicinity of
          the intersection.]Bewildered, Corey tries to step out into the street but
          something blocks her -- an invisible FORCE FIELD makes
          forward progress impossible.RIPPLES swell like waves throughout the barrier where she hit
          it. She looks up, following the ripples with her eyes, and
          watches as they disappear beyond her realm of vision, into
          infinite space.She reaches forth with her hand, wanting to feel the barrier
          once again... Just as she touches it... REAL TIME RESUMES --KA-BOOM!FROM OUT OF NOWHERE AN OLD JALOPY SAILS RIGHT IN FRONTRANDY'S CAR! He jerks the wheel -- and the JALOPY hits on the
          front passenger side -- completely smashing it in --Sam spins when she HEARS the deafening CRUNCH...Randy careens into the opposite lane, and an ONCOMING CAR
          smacks him dead on. The inertia from the oncoming vehicle
          plows his car into a FIRE HYDRANT by the side of the road.The hydrant goes flying through the air like a bullet ---- AND STRIKES SAM RIGHT IN THE HEAD!35.The world goes SILENT.CHRIS RUNS TOWARD THE DESTRUCTION, DROPPING HIS CIGARETTE...WATER ERUPTS LIKE A GEYSER FROM THE PIPE WHERE THE HYDRANTUSED TO BE...SAM'S BODY IS CRUMPLED IN THE STREET, MOTIONLESS...BILLY MOORCROFT IS GONE. THE FORCE FIELD IS GONE. COREYSTANDS FROZEN, HORRIFIED... IN UTTER SHOCK.INT. POLICE STATION - AFTERNOONCorey signs her STATEMENT on Officer O'Dell's desk, the
          expression of shock still glued to her face. O'Dell sits
          facing her.OFFICER O'DELLYou're sure you didn't see a
                    driver?COREYNo...He takes the statement from her.OFFICER O'DELLWell, you're one lucky girl to have
                    gotten outta the car when you did.
                    Front passenger side was wiped
                    right out. Coulda' been two dead
                    girls today instead of one.Corey nods, taking this in.OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)I talked to Randy and sent him home
                    a little while ago. He's pretty
                    shook up.Corey doesn't respond. O'Dell leans in to speak to her in
          confidence.OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)Both of us know he'd been doin'
                    some drinkin' today. But we also
                    know he's not at fault here. That
                    old beater cut right in front him.COREYCan't you just look up the license
                    plates?36.OFFICER O'DELLNo plates on the vehicle. We're
                    investigating the VIN, but that
                    could take a little more time,
                    depending on the history of
                    ownership. We'll find him.Corey seems somewhat hesitant to bring up the next subject:COREYWhat about the missing boy?O'Dell shifts in his chair.OFFICER O'DELLYou really think it was him, huh?COREYHe was on the side of the road
                    right before the accident.OFFICER O'DELLI'm no psychiatrist, but I do know
                    sometimes shock does funny
                    things...COREYYou think I was hallucinating?OFFICER O'DELLWe were on the scene five minutes
                    after the accident. I think
                    somebody woulda noticed a little
                    boy wandering around.He sees how troubled Corey is.OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)Why don't you stop in and see Dr.
                    Peters on your way out... right
                    down the hall there. She'll give
                    you somethin' to make you feel
                    better.Corey nods and gets up to leave. As she's on her way out,
          O'Dell's voice stops her.OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)Oh, uh... is there anything you
                    wanted to say to Samantha's
                    parents?Corey's expression is blank.37.COREYLike what?EXT. POLICE STATION, BACK PARKING LOT - AFTERNOONCorey walks out of the police station and finds herself in a
          secluded back parking lot. She holds a PRESCRIPTION for anti-
          depressants.She is frightened when she notices a PAIR OF EYES staring at
          her from the bushes close by -- it's Vietnam Tom. He's
          wearing his ski mask and he's got his rifle.Corey backs away as Tom slowly creeps toward her... She's
          about to scream for help when Chris Holt comes out of the
          police station behind her.CHRISGet the hell outta here.Grateful for his presence, Corey moves to stand behind Chris.
          Tom shuffles away.CHRIS (CONT'D)Should know better than to be
                    carrying his rifle around town like
                    that...Corey takes a breath, recovering from her scare.CHRIS (CONT'D)You okay?COREYWhat're you doing here?CHRISI had to put in a statement too.
                    Can I give you a lift?I/E. CHRIS' TRUCK/MOTEL - EVENINGChris and Corey pull up to the motel in his pick-up. They've
          gotten Corey's prescription filled, and she has the BOTTLE OF
          PILLS in her hand.CHRISI'm real sorry about Sam.Corey nods.38.CHRIS (CONT'D)It's such a waste. Just a horrible,
                    freak thing.COREYI said some pretty shitty things to
                    her right before it happened.CHRISI'm sure she knew you didn't mean
                    it.Corey gets out of the car and walks toward the motel room.INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - EVENINGCorey swallows two of her PILLS with some liquor from a
          plastic cup. She sits down on one of the full-size beds where
          Sam's belongings are spread out.She opens Sam's backpack and discovers THE PHILOSOPHY OF TIME
          TRAVEL book, by Roberta Sparrow...As Corey studies the cover, her image is reflected by the
          CLOSET DOOR MIRRORS. The angle of the mirrors creates double
          image reflections for other objects in the room. Strangely,
          Corey's reflection is only present in one of the panes.The digital CLOCK/RADIO shows 6:30 PM...There are PICTURES of Sam's family tucked away inside the
          book, between the pages: Sam with her mother and father, ROSE
          and EDDIE DARKO; YOUNG SAM with ELIZABETH and DONNIE; an old
          photo of the whole Darko family together -- Young Sam holds
          ARIEL, a STUFFED TOY UNICORN.Corey removes the pictures and sets them on the nightstand...
          She then looks down and notices that the book is open to:CHAPTER THREE - THE FRAGMENTARY UNIVERSE.COREYFragmentary Universe...She pours over the text, some of which reads: When the fabric
          of the fourth dimension within a Tangent Universe becomes
          corrupted, a highly unstable and volatile Fragmentary
          Universe can occur, sustaining itself for no longer than
          several days... FADE TO BLACK.39.INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - LATER - NIGHTCorey awakens to the sound of a little boy CRYING. She sits
          up in bed. The clock/radio reads 3:30 AM. The CRYING is faint
          but steady and sorrowful, and sounds as though it's coming
          from outside...EXT. MOTEL - NIGHTCorey follows the distinctive CRYING toward the VENDING
          MACHINES on the side of the building......until Billy Moorcroft emerges from behind them. Corey
          freezes a few feet away from the boy, who wears the BIRTHDAY
          HAT, SLACKS and COLLARED SHIRT. He is pale and bruised.Corey sees that he is not crying -- it's coming from
          elsewhere in the cosmos, far away. The WAILS taper off to a
          faint, DISTORTED WHISPER as Billy speaks:BILLY MOORCROFTYou need to save me, Corey.Corey stares at him in disbelief.BILLY MOORCROFT (CONT'D)You need to save me... and save the
                    world.COREYWhy can't anyone see you?BILLY MOORCROFTIf you tell them about me they'll
                    think you're a dummy.COREYWhy me?BILLY MOORCROFTI didn't pick you. Just like you
                    didn't pick me either.Corey stands before him in awe, transfixed.BILLY MOORCROFT (CONT'D)We shouldn't even be here. Nobody
                    should...Corey takes notice of the vending machines behind him. Where
          the prices should be, NUMBERS flash in a rhythm that seems to
          coincide with the ululations of the distant CRYING: 2...
          10... 16... 44... -end-... 2... 10... 16... 44... -end-...40.BILLY MOORCROFT (CONT'D)You don't have much time.Corey is about to respond when the sound of a DOOR OPENING
          stops her. The FLASHING NUMBERS on the vending machines go
          back to normal PRICES, the CRYING SOUND CEASES, and Billy
          disappears.PHIL (O.S.)What's goin' on out here?Corey looks over and sees Phil dressed in nightclothes,
          having come out of a room near the lobby. She's dumbstruck.COREYNothing... I-I don't know.PHILGo back to your room and get some
                    sleep. You've had a tough day.Phil goes back inside, leaving her alone.INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAYCorey wanders through the aisles of the department store,
          looking peaked and jittery. She comes upon Chris stocking
          some shelves near the back of the store.CHRISHey... how ya feelin'?COREYNot so good.CHRISIs there anything I can do?COREYI need some cigarettes... and maybe
                    some food. But I don't really have
                    any money right now.CHRISI'm off at 3:30. Meet me out behind
                    the store.EXT. BEHIND THE DEPARTMENT STORE - LATER - AFTERNOONCorey waits on the cement steps by the loading dock. She
          shoots up when Chris comes out the back entrance with aPLASTIC BAG...41.Corey takes it from him and looks inside: CANDY BARS, a BAG
          OF CHIPS, some PEANUTS, a pack of CIGARETTES.COREYThanks.She tears open the cigarettes and lights one. Chris lights up
          one of his own, and notices Corey's hands are shaking.CHRISShouldn't you go back home?COREYThere's nothing for me to go home
                    to. Trust me.CHRISWhat about Sam's funeral?Corey looks conflicted, but she takes a harsh stance:COREYWhat's the point? She's gone,
                    that's it. Nothing's gonna change
                    that...Chris lets it go.COREY (CONT'D)Is there a library around here?CHRIS(PUZZLED)Yeah... you need a book?COREYIs it walking distance?CHRISI can take you.COREYI think I'd rather walk.EXT. STREET - AFTERNOONCorey and Chris stroll together along a quiet street.CHRISSo you guys were real close, huh.42.COREYWhen I moved to Virginia Sam was
                    like the only person I could even
                    stand to talk to.CHRISHow long had you been plannin' your
                    trip together?COREYNot too long... kind of a last
                    minute thing. It was good timing,
                    `cause I don't like to stay in one
                    place for too long, ya know?CHRISHuh...COREYI was really surprised when Sam
                    wanted to come, actually. I just
                    kinda brought it up one day, and
                    she was down...Corey reflects for a beat.COREY (CONT'D)If it wasn't for me, she'd still be
                    alive right now.CHRISYou can't think like that.COREYIt's true, isn't it?Chris doesn't respond.INT. LIBRARY, MICROFICHE RESEARCH BOOTH - AFTERNOONCorey and Chris sit before a screen in a cramped, dim booth
          near the back of the library. They stare at a MICROFILM
          ARTICLE from 1988 about DONNIE DARKO'S DEATH.CHRISThat was Sam's brother?COREYYeah.On the screen is a PHOTOGRAPH of the DARKO HOUSE with many
          PEOPLE gathered in front of it. A JET ENGINE is being lifted
          away by a CRANE.43.CHRISHer parents must be going through
                    hell.COREYSam said once she wished it landed
                    on her room instead of Donnie's.Chris thinks on this.CHRISI saw something on Sam's wrist the
                    other night... it looked like a
                    scar.COREYShe told me it was from some
                    accident. Put her hand through a
                    window or something.CHRISDid you believe her?Corey doesn't answer. She pulls up ANOTHER ARTICLE, one that
          chronicles a MAN who was IMPALED BY A METAL PIPE with no
          known origin...A THIRD ARTICLE is about a LITTLE GIRL who was DECAPITATED BY
          A MANHOLE COVER that was inexplicably flying through the
          air...CHRIS (CONT'D)God...Chris is horrified. Corey is totally engrossed.She brings up a FINAL ARTICLE that tells the story of a BOY
          who was CRUSHED BY A DUMPSTER that fell from the sky. A
          PICTURE shows his legs sticking out from under it like the
          Wicked Witch of the East when Dorothy's house fell on her in
          Munchkinland.CHRIS (CONT'D)I don't understand why we're
                    lookin' at this stuff.COREYThey still never found a driver to
                    that car that hit Randy... I was
                    standing right there. I didn't see
                    anyone.44.CHRISI was pretty close too, but
                    everything was all crazy. Whoever
                    it was must've jumped out and took
                    off.COREYI found this book in Sam's backpack
                    last night. There's a chapter where
                    it talks about stuff like this
                    happening. Like a guy being killed
                    by an arrow that nobody shot, and a
                    swordsmith getting killed by a
                    sword he hadn't made yet.
                    Unexplainable things, but it says
                    there's a reason why they happen.CHRISA book...? I don't get what your
                    talkin' about. What was the reason?COREYIt didn't say.Corey thinks, trying to figure out the right way to express
          something...COREY (CONT'D)Last night, and right before the
                    accident, I saw...CHRISWhat?COREYNothing.Corey sighs and turns back to the screen.COREY (CONT'D)You already think I'm a freak show.INT. LIBRARY, FRONT DESK - AFTERNOONAs Chris and Corey are on the way out, they notice Jeremy
          Frame at the counter checking out a STACK OF BOOKS.In putting them down, he accidentally drops half of them onto
          the floor. He looks frazzled as he begins to pick them up,
          and he scratches compulsively at his LEFT FOREARM...45.I/E. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - AFTERNOONChris and Corey pull up to Dusty's auto repair shop in Chris'
          truck.They get out and start to walk up to the garage, but they're
          cut off by the unchained PIT BULL -- it's growling and
          barking in a frenzy --RUTH (O.S.)Darielle!The dog heels at the sound of the voice, and Ruth bolts out
          of the house and takes her by the collar. She's got a bandage
          over a cut on her forehead.RUTH (CONT'D)Come to check on your car?COREYYeah...Hearts still thumping in their chests, they follow Ruth into
          the garage... COREY'S CHEVROLET is parked in the same spot it
          was when she left it the other day. The hood is propped open.RUTHRandy's been a wreck since the
                    accident.CHRISHe should be. He was driving around
                    shit-faced and somebody got killed.RUTHYou can just fuck off...She gets right up in his face with such intensity that Chris
          retreats a step or two.RUTH (CONT'D)Prima donna motherfucker think your
                    shit don't stink?Corey steps in:COREYShe's right...Chris gives her a look.COREY (CONT'D)I mean, there's nothing Randy
                    could've done.46.Ruth turns and goes into the house through a GARAGE ENTRANCE.RUTHI'll get my dad.The door slams shut behind her, and Corey and Chris glance at
          each other...Momentarily, Dusty comes out, a partially eaten SANDWICH in
          hand.DUSTYGot some bad news for you...He walks them over to the car, finishing off his sandwich and
          wiping his hands on his greasy jeans.DUSTY (CONT'D)Your engine seized up when your
                    water pump blew.COREYI need a new engine now?DUSTYI can get one in there for you.
                    Cost you about fifteen hundred.Corey's face drops.COREYI don't have anywhere near that
                    much money.CHRISThat's probably as much as the
                    car's worth.DUSTYI understand. But, I already
                    ordered the water pump, and I'll
                    have to get paid for my time. That
                    comes to about three-hundred total.COREYI don't have that much either.Dusty is perturbed.DUSTYYou think I do this for charity?47.CHRISYou didn't do anything. What's she

          same time, Father Homeijer and Trudy come out of the FRONT
          OFFICE carrying a COLLECTIONS JAR.As they approach the truck Chris slowly rolls down the
          window.FATHER HOMEIJERGood afternoon.TRUDYWe're taking collections to help

                    drive me around if you didn't want

                    works.CHRISMaybe you're wrong about that.Corey nods, but still doesn't believe him.COREYSee ya.She gets out, and Chris eyes her as she walks to her room.INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHTCorey lays on her stomach in bed, her head buried in The
          Philosophy of Time Travel book. The TELEVISION is on in the
          b.g. (out of focus), playing a repeat of the FOREMAN GRILLINFOMERCIAL...Suddenly, there is a slight TREMOR from outside and RIPPLE
          runs over the TV screen.Corey looks around, taking no notice of the odd change on the
          television -- instead of GEORGE FOREMAN'S VOICE, HULK HOGAN
          is HEARD promoting the brand new HULKSTER GRILL...Just then, there is a KNOCK at the door. She gets up to
          answer it and finds Randy -- he looks distraught.RANDYDo you hate me?COREYHuh?49.RANDYYou think it's my fault she's dead.COREYNo...RANDYYou mean it?COREYYeah... it wasn't your fault.Randy sighs as if a big weight has been lifted.RANDYWhat's that?Corey looks down and realizes that she's still holding The
          Philosophy of Time Travel book in her hand.COREYOh, it's just... something of
                    Sam's.Randy nods. Corey tosses the book onto the bed.RANDYYou wanna get outta here for a
                    while? I got my dad's car.I/E. RANDY'S DAD'S CAR/LOOKOUT - NIGHTRANDY'S DAD'S CAR navigates a DIRT ROAD up a WOODED HILL to a
          VANTAGE POINT where the whole of El Reno can be seen. SPARSE
          LIGHTS flicker over about 80 square miles of civilization.There are a few OTHER VEHICLES parked at the lookout, most
          containing COUPLES with MUSIC playing low.Randy pulls into a more SECLUDED CLEARING, away from the
          other cars but still with a nice view.RANDYI've been comin' up here since I
                    was a kid. Good place when you
                    wanna just get away from
                    everything.Randy pushes in a TAPE (suggestion: River of Deceit, by Mad
          Season), then takes a JOINT from his pocket and sparks it up.COREYIs Ruth your girlfriend?50.Randy passes the joint to Corey and she hits it.RANDYNaw, we're just friends. She's
                    pretty weird sometimes. Too like...
                    intense, or something.COREYSeems like you guys are pretty
                    close.RANDYYeah... don't worry about Ruth.Randy takes another hit and holds it in.COREYDo you ever have a hard time
                    telling what's real and what's not
                    real?Randy exhales and looks over at her, perplexed.RANDYSometimes... sometimes something
                    can feel really real, but it's just
                    your mind playing tricks on you.COREYI've got so much shit in my head
                    right now... I've never felt so
                    outta control. I think I'm really
                    goin' psycho.He passes her the joint.RANDYI got some acid from my buddy one
                    time... this like flying eagle
                    pyramid shit. I took two hits, and
                    man... next thing I knew I was on
                    the floor, curled up in ball, and
                    Mike and Jeff were just standing
                    there lookin' down at me. I could
                    see this like glowing grid cutting
                    through my brain, and I knew when
                    it got all the way through I'd be
                    this sketched out vegetable. I
                    could picture my dad staring down
                    at me in the hospital in my
                    straightjacket, crying and shit...Corey blows out a hit, captivated...51.RANDY (CONT'D)The whole time my esophagus was
                    like twisting and turning in my
                    throat and cutting off my air
                    supply... it was terrible.COREYJesus.RANDYI can still slip back into it
                    sometimes, but I know now that my
                    brain is what's making it real...
                    and that's like a blessing and a
                    curse, man, `cause that means you
                    have to decide what's real and
                    what's not.COREYThe things that feel the most real
                    right now are... impossible. More
                    like a dream.Corey passes him the joint and he stamps out the roach in the
          car's ashtray.RANDYI know what you mean. The scariest
                    part is thinking you're not the
                    same person anymore. Something's
                    changed... like your identity.COREYWhat if the change is for the
                    better?Randy finds an INHALER in his pocket and takes a puff.RANDYThat's fucked up.COREYI don't think I even care if I'm
                    crazy.Corey turns and looks into his eyes. Randy leans forward...
          They're about to kiss, when --COREY (CONT'D)What the fuck?A DARK SHAPE scurries to an enclosed area at the edge of the
          forest where there's a TARP, some WATER BOTTLES, CANS OF FOOD
          and a RIFLE...52.It's Vietnam Tom, and he's brought some supplies to his NEWSQUATTING GROUND.COREY (CONT'D)That fucking guy again...Randy and Corey both laugh, relieving the tension. But Tom's
          proximity has spoiled the mood.RANDYLet's get outta here.INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHTMike, Jeff and Ruth sit on a ratty couch in Randy's living
          room, watching BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD on MTV. Some EMPTY BEER
          CANS and a HOMEADE BONG litter a coffee table. When the FRONT
          DOOR OPENS and Corey and Randy enter, none of them budge.As Corey and Randy walk to Randy's bedroom, Ruth follows them
          with her eyes...INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUSRandy shuts the door to his messy room. A TAPESTRY hangs from
          the ceiling. Corey is drawn to a DESK next to the bed. Above
          it is a DEATH SHRINE to KURT COBAIN -- MAGAZINE CUTOUTS,
          POSTERS and TICKET STUBS arranged decoratively.A large BLACK & WHITE POSTER showing a CLOSE   UP of COBAIN'S
          FACE is the centerpiece, and a sloppy BULLET   HOLE drawn in
          RED MARKER marks the center of his forehead.   The words `I'M
          NOT AFRAID OF DYING' are scrawled across the   bottom of the
          poster in the same BRIGHT RED.COREYThis is cool.RANDYThanks.Randy puts his hands on her hips, running them up her torso.
          Corey turns to face him...They kiss......and fall back onto the bed...53.INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER - NIGHTA DIGITAL CLOCK on Randy's DESK shows 3:30 AM. There's a
          SLIGHT TREMOR and the numbers shift, changing briefly to
          01:10:23:08, then back again to 3:30.Corey wakes suddenly from a nightmare. She sits up and looks
          around, remembering where she is. She discovers Randy asleep
          by her side. She finds a pile of clothes on the floor beside
          the bed and grabs her shirt......after she pulls it on over her head, she freezes --
          because Billy Moorcroft is standing right there in his
          BIRTHDAY HAT, staring at her.BILLY MOORCROFTOnly one day left.Corey turns and looks down to Randy. He's still fast asleep.COREYWhat am I supposed to do?As soon as she utters her question she notices a silvery,
          liquid VECTOR SPEAR protruding from the center of her chest.Billy is now gone, but her SPEAR beckons her out of the room,
          elongating to illustrate her path. Corey is in awe...INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHTHer SPEAR leads her through the living room, and past the
          sleeping bodies of Mike, Jeff and Ruth. Following her path
          leads her to step on RUTH'S FOOT as she goes by...Corey doesn't even notice, but one of Ruth's eyes pop open as
          she treads out the door...EXT. STREET - NIGHTCorey follows Billy, who walks in the middle of the road
          about 15 yards ahead of her. The residential street is
          guarded by great, OLD TREES on either side.The dark sky above starts to BEND and WARP, and a BUCKLE in
          space-time materializes.There's a simultaneous flash of LIGHTING and sharp CRACK OF
          THUNDER, and Corey looks up to the VORTEX -- a massive,
          swirling MAELSTROM gapes open like a tunnel to the inter-
          dimensional realm of darkest night.54.The VOID brightens, and ominous STORM CLOUDS and TORRENTIAL
          RAINS are visible within...Corey peers up into the MOUTH of it and sees DUSTY'S HOUSE
          AND AUTO REPAIR SHOP being doused and beaten by the STORM --INT. DUSTY'S GARAGE - NIGHTIn contrast to the street, all is nearly SILENT in Dusty's
          garage. Corey watches as Billy moves along the perimeter
          WITHOUT SOUND, ghostly... JUMP CUTS and TIME CUTS.Her CHEVROLET sits in the bay. Some of the PARTS have already
          been harvested -- the CATALYTIC CONVERTER sits next to it on
          the floor.Corey approaches a UTILITY SINK next to a SHOWER in the
          corner...BILLY MOORCROFTYou can do it.COREYHow?BILLY MOORCROFTIt's easy.Corey focuses on the sink, and it begins to tremble. The
          pipes beneath it CREAK and MOAN. WATER starts to bubble up
          from the sink drain, also in the shower...Billy stands atop her car, watching her. His perpetually
          morose expression transforms into a smile.The SINK BASIN suddenly cracks from pressure. As Corey stares
          into the drain... WE PLUNGE DOWN INTO THE PIPE --POV OF TELEKINETIC ENERGY - INSIDE THE PIPEWe travel through meters and meters of DANK PIPING until we

          covered with water. FIRE TRUCKS, POLICE CARS and an AMBULANCE
          are gathered in front of the property.ANGLE: DOWN THE STREETRuth runs toward her house. When she turns a corner and it
          comes into view, she stops dead in her tracks. Her face shows
          sheer terror --Because her father Dusty is handcuffed and being loaded into
          the back of a cruiser by Officer O'Dell and another
          policeman, OFFICER HINES......the PIT BULL struggles against it's CHAIN, growling and

          through the Fourth Dimensional Construct...Corey glances over at the CLOSET MIRROR and sees Billy's
          image reflected. She flips over and finds him standing at the
          foot of the bed, clad in the same garb as all her visions.COREYI already saved you.BILLY MOORCROFTIt's not over.He points to the CLOSET MIRROR... She stares into her own
          reflection as BILLY'S DISAPPEARS.HER IMAGE starts to FADE as well, and then the SURFACE OF THE
          MIRROR TRANSFORMS into a three-dimensional vision of a PARK.
          The focus is a SWING SET... and one of the SWINGS in

          small gathering to celebrate his return. STREAMERS hang over
          a table supporting a partially eaten CAKE. A BANNER that
          reads `WELCOME HOME BILLY!' is draped across the archway
          connecting the DINING ROOM to the DEN.BILLY'S MOTHER (32), with her fair complexion and dark hair,

          at the DRAWING that he's working on.BILLY'S MOTHERAre you sure you don't want some
                    more cake?Billy nods. His mother caresses his head as she watches him
          color. After a moment she sits down in a chair beside him and

                    hell've you been?COREYI crashed at Randy's. We just got

                    a fuck-ass.JEFFDid she just call her a fuck-ass?MIKEWhat's a fuck-ass?Everyone cracks up, including Corey. Sam is humiliated. She
          backs away from the car, anger burning in her eyes. Randy
          revs the engine, expressing his will to take off.COREYSee ya later, Sam.Sam says nothing, but watches as Randy's car peels off toward
          the intersection. She's confused and hurt, frozen to the spot
          where she's standing.As Corey stares back at Sam from the car, her smile fades...INT. RANDY'S CAR - CONTINUOUSCorey turns to face the approaching intersection. Resolute.INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOONChris is at work, stocking shelves inside the department
          store...He checks his watch, stops what he's doing and grabs a PACK
          OF CIGARETTES from his breast pocket -- time for a smoke
          break.64.EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOONRandy's car is stopped at the red light. Sam strolls toward
          it ever so slowly. Jeff, Mike and Ruth gawk at her from the
          backseat.She slows down even more, having no interest in subjecting
          herself to any more of their mockery...The light turns green, and Randy's car peels across the
          intersection, making a left. Sam's still 10 or 15 feet away
          from stepping into the street...She quickens her pace, almost there when --KA-BOOM!FROM OUT OF NOWHERE AN OLD JALOPY SAILS RIGHT IN FRONTRANDY'S CAR! He jerks the wheel -- and the jalopy hits on the
          front passenger side -- completely smashing it in --Sam spins when she HEARS the deafening CRUNCH...Randy careens into the opposite lane, and an ONCOMING CAR
          smacks him dead on. The inertia from the oncoming vehicle
          plows his car into a FIRE HYDRANT by the side of the road.The hydrant goes flying through the air like a bullet and
          skitters harmlessly across the intersection --The world goes SILENT.CHRIS RUNS TOWARD THE DESTRUCTION, DROPPING HIS CIGARETTE...WATER ERUPTS LIKE A GEYSER FROM THE PIPE WHERE THE HYDRANTUSED TO BE...THE JALOPY IS FLIPPED OVER ONTO ITS SIDE...SAM STANDS PEERING AT THE WRECKAGE... THE AREA OF THE CARWHERE COREY WAS SITTING IS VIRTUALLY NONEXISTENT. SHE DROPSTO HER KNEES.INT. POLICE STATION - AFTERNOONSam signs her STATEMENT on Officer O'Dell's desk, her eyes
          red and puffy from crying. O'Dell sits facing her.OFFICER O'DELLI just gotta ask you one more
                     time... you're sure you didn't see
                     a driver?65.Sam shakes her head no, and he takes the statement from her.OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)Well, we'll find him, one way or
                    another.Sam nods in acknowledgement. O'Dell sees how much this has
          traumatized her.OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)Why don't you stop in and see Dr.
                    Peters on your way out... right
                    down the hall there. She'll give

                    better.EXT. POLICE STATION, BACK PARKING LOT - AFTERNOONSam walks out of the police station and finds herself in the
          secluded back parking lot. She holds a PRESCRIPTION for anti-
          depressants...A pair of eyes peek out of the bushes close by -- it's
          Vietnam Tom. He's wearing his ski mask and he's got his
          rifle. He sees Sam, but she doesn't see him.Sam wells up with emotion, about to breakdown, and Tom
          watches her with empathy. It looks as though he's about to go
          to her when something stops him -- Chris comes out the door.CHRISYou okay?Sam is still too choked up to speak. Tom sneaks away
          unnoticed...INT. CHRIS' TRUCK - AFTERNOONSam sits in the passenger side of Chris' truck and cries and
          cries. Major emotional release.Chris looks like he wants to say something, but doesn't have
          the words.I/E. CHRIS' TRUCK/MOTEL - EVENINGChris and Sam pull up to the motel in his pick-up. They've
          gone to get her prescription filled, and Sam has the BOTTLE
          OF PILLS in her hand.66.CHRISI'm really sorry, Sam.She doesn't respond.CHRIS (CONT'D)It's horrible... but sometimes
                    these things can happen for a
                    reason. Sometimes good can come of
                    it... growth, ya know?SAMWhat the fuck are you talking
                    about?Sam's benumbed expression doesn't change, but her tone is
          caustic.CHRISAll I meant was, sometimes-SAMI know what you meant, and it's
                    bullshit. When someone dies for no
                    reason you can't just make one up
                    to fill the void and make yourself
                    feel better. It sucks, and it fucks
                    everything up, but it doesn't mean
                    shit beyond that.CHRISI'm sorry, I-SAMYou've obviously never lost anybody
                    like I have, `cause if you did
                    you'd already know that.Chris doesn't try anymore. Sam immediately feels bad.SAM (CONT'D)Thanks for the ride.She gets out of the car and slogs toward her room.INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - EVENINGSam swallows her PILLS with some water, and sits down on one
          of the full-size beds by her BACKPACK...She reaches inside and pulls out THE PHILOSOPHY OF TIME
          TRAVEL book, by Roberta Sparrow. As she studies the cover,
          her image is reflected by the CLOSET DOOR MIRRORS.67.The angle of the mirrors creates double image reflections for
          other objects in the room... and Sam's reflection is present
          in both of the panes.The digital CLOCK/RADIO shows 6:30 PM...She looks at the PICTURES OF HER FAMILY tucked away inside
          the book: Sam with her mother and father; Sam as a child with
          her sister and brother; an old photo of the whole Darko
          family together...Tears come to her eyes as she focuses on an image of Donnie,
          and she puts them all down. She touches the SCAR on the inner
          part of her right wrist...She then glances down and notices that the book is open to:CHAPTER NINE - REMNANTS.SAMRemnants...A portion of the text includes: Like Dreams that the
          Manipulated can have after journeys into Tangent or
          Fragmentary Universes, sounds and images may be transferred
          from one Tangent or Fragmentary Universe to another, as all

          SWEATSHIRT and JEANS, with the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE wrapped
          around her right hand. The SHARD OF METAL protrudes from the
          GASH by her temple.SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - THE JUNKYARDShe sees the junkyard as the phosphorescent DESTINY PLANE.
          DEAD CARS, MACHINERY and piles of SCRAP METAL glow as
          stationary objects within the complex grid. A PAIR OF RATS
          follow their VECTOR SPEARS as they shimmy up the side of aRUSTY TRACTOR...Sam treads effortlessly through the darkness, past the heaps
          of junk toward the decrepit STORAGE SHACK marked by theCORRUGATED ROOFING...ANGLE: STORAGE SHACKShe stands before the shack, having discovered Vietnam Tom.
          He squats in the darkened corner of the scrappy shelter, and
          looks back at her through the eyeholes of a new mask --68.He wears on his face the SCULPTURE made of SCRAP METAL, which
          has been formed into the COUNTENANCE OF THE MONSTER BUNNY.SAMHi, Tom. I like your new mask.Tom trembles like the frightened animal he personifies as Sam
          runs her fingers down one of the LONG, METALLIC EARS, down to
          one of the SHARPENED INCISORS of the EVIL-LOOKING GRIN...SAM (CONT'D)Are you scared?As this contact is made the tarnished metal becomes
          transparent, and the NEURONS in TOM'S BRAIN can be seen
          sending ELECTRIC IMPULSES, in turn RELEASING
          NEUROTRANSMITTERS and exciting OTHER NEURONS...SAM (CONT'D)I know you can hear me...A PORTAL forms around the shelter like a giant cylinder,
          enclosing them. Tom rises, afraid... Sam takes his hand...The PORTAL shrinks and squeezes the walls until they bend
          inward, then begin to CREAK and RUMBLE --EXT. BENEATH OVERPASS - THE NEXT MORNINGSam awakens to a fierce RUMBLING overhead.It happens again, and when she looks around she realizes that
          she's underneath a highway overpass in BOXER SHORTS and a T-
          SHIRT, barefoot, lying on a FLAT AREA atop the CEMENT SLOPE
          that leads down to the road below.Alarmed by both the height and sanitation of her current
          position, she shifts her body and starts to slide down theSLOPE...Once on even ground, she notices a brand new `95 BMW coming
          toward her.SAMPerfect...Jeremy pulls up next to her and rolls down his window.JEREMYSam? Are you okay? What are doing?SAMI'm... yeah, I'm okay.69.Jeremy gets out of the car and puts his hand on her shoulder.JEREMYYou shouldn't be out here like
                    this. C'mon, get in.She allows herself to be led to the passenger side...INT. JEREMY'S BMW - MORNINGSam leans her head back against the headrest as Jeremy
          drives.JEREMYYou do that a lot?SAMI think it's genetic or something.JEREMYThat's interesting... I've never
                    heard of a specific genetic marker
                    for sleepwalking.SAMIt's just that my brother used to
                    do it too.JEREMYHe doesn't anymore?SAMNo.JEREMYI think it's more common in
                    children. When did your brother
                    stop?SAMWhen he died.EXT. FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - MORNINGSome WORKERS are in the process of   rebuilding the WINDMILL. A
          MAN WITH A HOSE sprays the side of   the WATER TANK in an
          attempt to wash off the burn marks   resembling the nearly
          imperceptible image of the MONSTER   BUNNY'S FACE...70.I/E. JEREMY'S BMW/MOTEL - MORNINGJeremy pulls into the motel parking lot. Sam hesitates for a
          moment before getting out.JEREMYI heard about your friend...Sam doesn't say anything, so he goes on.JEREMY (CONT'D)I wasn't gonna say anything... but
                    then I thought I probably should,
                    because if I didn't, it might be
                    inconsiderate.SAMWell... okay. Thanks.A beat.JEREMYSo... what are you gonna do?SAMI don't know yet.Sam brushes her mussed hair out of her face, still not
          wanting to go inside the motel room.SAM (CONT'D)Do you believe that everything
                    happens for a reason?JEREMYI know that for every action
                    there's an equal and opposite
                    reaction.SAMYeah... I learned that in science.JEREMYAnd everything in the universe is
                    in constant motion, as the universe
                    is constantly expanding...SAMYeah, but do you believe that
                    everything happens for a reason,
                    like in life?JEREMYYou mean like destiny?71.Jeremy thinks on this for a moment.JEREMY (CONT'D)I think everyone has a purpose.
                    Something they're meant to do. Like
                    potential, but more clear-cut. For

                    every day, practically sleeping at
                    the lab...While he talks and becomes more excited he scratches
          nervously at his left forearm. It draws Sam's attention away
          from what he's saying.JEREMY (CONT'D)I'm still doing some tests, but
                    there's a metallic substance that's

          his wrist is RAW and RED, partially SCABBED OVER.JEREMYIt's just a rash.Sam starts to get out of the car.JEREMY (CONT'D)Sam, wait. Here...He offers her a wad of cash. Sam hesitates.SAMBUT-JEREMYI know you need it. It's no big

          DRYER. She plugs in some quarters, presses the button, and
          sits back in a chair in front of the machine.As she stares into the whirling cylinder, her eyes defocus

          Someone on the other end finally picks up:ROSE DARKO (V.O.)Hello?When Sam HEARS her MOTHER'S VOICE, it brings tears to her

          over all of El Reno. He peers at the twinkling lights through
          his scrap metal BUNNY MASK, and cradles his RIFLE in his arms
          like a soldier at rest.He slowly turns and sees that Sam is sitting right next to
          him, facing the landscape. She wears her HOODED SWEATSHIRT,
          JEANS and the BANDAGE. The SHARD OF METAL is lodged in her
          forehead.SAMYou wanna know what happens when
                    you die?Tom shakes his head no.SAM (CONT'D)I wish it was me.She looks at Tom.SAM (CONT'D)I really want... to die.Tom aims his gun at her face...He realizes that a FORCE FIELD has formed in between them,
          because when the barrel of the gun touches it, the barrier
          bends and becomes slightly opaque.Sam is expressionless. Tom's finger trembles as he places it
          on the trigger.He aims down the gun's sights, directly at Sam's RIGHT EYE,
          and sees a PHOSPHORESCENT GRID take shape like a coordinate
          system on the force field. Sam's eye is in the CENTRALQUADRANT...Tom pulls the trigger. TIME SLOWS DOWN.A liquid VECTOR SPEAR shoots out of the gun barrel.
          Immediately after, a BULLET is discharged and follows it...The VECTOR SPEAR passes cleanly through the grid, but when
          the BULLET reaches it, the entire force field curves to
          accommodate the penetrating force...The spear juts out until it nearly touches Sam's eye... but
          then it stops. The bullet catches up and freezes at the same
          spot, centimeters from her face --75.SAM (CONT'D)(DISAPPOINTED)Not today.I/E. MOTEL ROOM 15 - DAYA HAND bangs on the door to room 15...After a beat, Sam opens it. She's got some makeup on, and has

          There are ROWS OF DESKS with MICROSCOPES and some PRECISIONROCK SLICING EQUIPMENT.As he walks to a desk near the back, he can barely contain
          his excitement. Sam follows, taking note of a LARGE RABBIT in
          an extremely SMALL CAGE...JEREMYHere's my station.He unlocks a drawer in the lower portion of the desk and
          retrieves a BOX containing a tiny SLICE OF ROCK with a grid-
          like PATTERN OF METALLIC CRYSTALS embedded in it.SAMThat's it?JEREMYThe rest is locked away somewhere
                    else... somewhere safe. Everyone's
                    gonna want a piece of this thing
                    pretty soon.He takes it over to an SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE and turns
          it on. He places the meteorite slice in the microscope's
          VACUUM COLUMN through an AIRTIGHT DOOR.77.JEREMY (CONT'D)You ever seen one of these?SAMNo.JEREMYIt's a scanning electron
                    microscope. It uses electrons
                    instead of light to scan the image.A BLACK & WHITE IMAGE appears on the microscope's MONITOR --
          it's a geometric collage of all shapes and shades.JEREMY (CONT'D)At first I thought it was a
                    siderite, but then I saw it was
                    more than that. Much more. It does
                    have a percentage of nickel and
                    iron in it as I first suspected.
                    But it also has something else.He waits for Sam to take the bait.SAMAnd what's that?He points to cluster of BRIGHT WHITES on the monitor. Their
          shapes are strangely different than the others surrounding
          them.JEREMYAn unrecognizable element. I've
                    done all the tests. It doesn't
                    exist on the periodic table.Jeremy is practically beaming.SAMSo this is pretty major.JEREMYThis is history. I'm thinking of
                    calling it framium.SAMFramium?JEREMYFor my last name... Frame.78.SAMWhat if it's like... proof of some
                    alien life-form from another galaxy
                    or something.Jeremy's tone becomes serious, and he starts to scratch at
          his left forearm as he talks.JEREMYIt's very important you promise me
                    you won't tell anyone else what
                    I've showed you. I have to wait

          up.She runs her fingers down the long, shiny ears, nose, and
          jagged teeth...She doesn't realize that Tom is standing close behind her.
          When she senses his presence she's startled.SAMSorry...She sets the BUNNY MASK down where she found it. Tom says
          nothing. He seems neither surprised nor irritated to find her

          her -- not too rough, but forceful.Sam's scared for a moment, but Tom lets her go. His eyes
          drift down to The Philosophy of Time Travel book by her side.
          Sam sees him staring, so she picks it up and hands it to him.When Tom sees the cover, his cold eyes are filled with
