     FADE IN on a long TRACKING SHOT through the universe.  As the NARRATOR
     speaks we move through galaxies, nebulae, solar systems, moving from
     the infinite slowly down to a particular planetary system deep within
     a maze of suns.NARRATOR(over)
                    It is the mid 22nd Century.  Mankind
                    has explored the boundaries of his
                    own solar system, and now he reaches
                    out to the endless interstellar
                    distances of the universe.  He moves
                    away from his own small planetary
                    system in huge hyperdrive starships:
                    computer-driven, self-supporting,
                    closed-system spacecraft that travel
                    at mind-staggering post-light
                    velocities.  Man has begun to spread
                    among the stars.  Enormous ships
                    embark with generations of colonists
                    searching the depths of space for
                    new earths, now homes, new
                    beginnings.  Far in advance of these
                    colony ships goes a new pioneer: the
                    scouts, the pathfinders, a special
                    breed of man who has dedicated his
                    life to blazing the trail through
                    the most distant, unexplored
                    galaxies, opening up the farthest
                    frontiers of space.  These are the
                    men of the Advance Exploration
                    Corps.  The task they face is one of
                    unbelievable isolation and
                    loneliness.  So far from home that
                    Earth is no longer even a point of
                    light in the sky, they must comb the
                    universe for those unstable planets
                    whose existence poses a threat to
                    the peaceful colonists that follow.
                    They must find these rogue planets
                    -- and destroy them.  Among these
                    commandos are the men of the
                    scoutshipDark Star.

     We are now moving toward a planet.  Floating in front of the planet is
     the SCOUTSHIP DARK STAR.  As we move toward the ship, we begin to hear
     VOICES, crackling with static.DOOLITTLE(over -- radio filter)

     CAMERA IS NOW FLOATING TOWARD THE OBSERVATION DOME on top of the ship.
     In the Dome sits TALBY.  He is staring around, wide-eyed, at the
     planets and stars.DOOLITTLE(over -- filter)
                    Talby, Talby, this is Doolittle.  Do

     There is a CRACKLE, and Doolittle's voice suddenly booms through, loud
     and clear:DOOLITTLE(cont'd)TALBY!TALBY(snaps out of it)

     CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL BACK along the length of the control room,
     revealing three men: BOILER, DOOLITTLE, and PINBACK.  They are seated
     close together in cramped little chairs, surrounded by a maze of
     instrumentation, pressing buttons, making adjustments and corrections.

     Pinback hits a button on his panel.INTERIOR - BOMB BAYThe screen is BLACK for an instant.  Then, two enormous doors begin to
     open ponderously, revealing the planet rotating below.  A huge BOMB,
     designated with a giant#19on its side, lowers slowly out of the
     ship on a rack.NARRATOR(over)
                    This is a chain-reaction bomb,
                    otherwise known as an Exponential
                    Thermostellar Device.  Its own
                    destructive power is small, barely
                    enough to vaporize twelve city
                    blocks.  However, when it explodes in
                    contact with an object the size of a
                    planet, it starts a chain-reaction
                    in the very matter of that planet,
                    turning it into a giant reactor
                    which destroys itself in one
                    staggering thermal flash.

                    These bombs are equipped with
                    sophisticated thought and speech
                    mechanisms, to allow them to make
                    executive decisions in the event of
                    a crisis situation.  These judgment

     There is a BLIPPING SOUND.  It is insistent.  Talby is rudely yanked
     from his reverie.  He looks down at a panel.  But his soft talk has
     started Doolittle reminiscing.DOOLITTLEYou know what I think about, Talby?TALBYI'm getting something here, on this

                    time to myself, I think about back
                    home, back home at Malibu.  I used to
                    surf a lot, Talby.  I used to be a
                    great surfer.TALBYLieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a

                    fantastic in the springs Talby.  I
                    can remember running out on the
                    beach early spring mornings with my
                    board and a wet suit...TALBYI can't seem to locate the

     Talby turns in his seat and addresses Doolittle directly.TALBYAh, Doolittle, I do have a
                    malfunction on this readout, but I

     appears in glowing green lines.

     fifteen times until it fills the screen.  The red light is pulsing in a

                    available to you is your sensory
                    data.  And this data is merely a

                    what you are remembering is merely a

                    you now realize have no necessary
                    connection with outside reality.BOMB #20True, but since this is so, I have
                    no proof that you are really telling
