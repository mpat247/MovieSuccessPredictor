THE IDES OF MARCHWritten by

                George Clooney, Grant Heslov & Beau WillimonINT. MIAMI UNIVERSITY - OXFORD OHIO - AUDITORIUM - DAYStephen Meyers, Press Secretary to Governor Morris is
          standing at a podium on a stage...there is a single spotlight
          on him. The rest of the stage is dark.
          Stephen is talking into a mic with no emotion...just matter
          of factly.STEPHENI am neither Christian...nor
           atheist. I am not Jewish or
           Muslim. What I believe...my
           religion is called the
           constitution...
          A pause.
          Stephen snaps his fingers in the mic. We hear the distinct
          sound of feedback getting louder until it stops.
                         
          We hear the director speak over the loud speaker.DIRECTORHang on...let me open these up....
          We wait as Stephen looks around. He looks at stage hands who
          are busy working. No one pays any attention to him as he
          stands there. This isn't awkward for Stephen, THIS ISROUTINE.DIRECTOR (CONT'D)Okay...
                         
          Lights come up on another podium revealing a debate stage.
          Stephen continues.STEPHENI will defend till my dying breath
           your right to worship whatever god
           you believe in...
                         
          The lights on Stephen's podium go out, he's in the dark. He
          keeps going.STEPHEN (CONT'D)If I'm not religious enough for
           you, don't vote for me.
          To the Director.(CONTINUED)2.CONTINUED:STEPHEN (CONT'D)You got it?
                         
          His podium light comes back on.
          No answer from the Director, Stephen continues.STEPHEN (CONT'D)If I'm not experienced enough don't
           vote for me. If I'm not...DIRECTOROkay got it, thanks.STEPHENThanks. We'll need these monitors
           turned up a bit...it's a big space
           and he wants to be able to hear.STAGE MANAGERYou got it.STEPHENAlso we'll need these podiums put
           on a riser as we agreed to in the
           pre-conditions. You're a few
           inches short and it makes it harder
           for the Governor to read his notes.STAGE MANAGERNo I know, we just got those specs
           last night and they're building a
           piece to go under...STEPHENGreat, thanks. See you guys in a
           few hours.
                         
          We see we're in an auditorium of a college.
          Stephen meets up with BEN HARPEN his staffer.BENI didn't know the Governor had
           trouble reading his notes. Why
           doesn't he wear...STEPHENHe doesn't but Pullman is 5'8"
           he'll look like a hobbit behind
           that podium.(CONTINUED)3.CONTINUED: (2)They walk off...CUT TO:EXT. MIAMI UNIVERSITY - OXFORD OHIO - DAYROB BRAUN, a local Cincinnati anchor, talks to camera as we
          see STEPHEN and BEN exit the building. Under this we hear

           did write this Governor...GOV. MORRISThen let me try and clarify...I was
           raised Catholic, I am not a
           practicing Catholic...I have no
           idea what happens when you die and
           if the Senator does, then perhaps
           he should be President. I'll even
           vote for him.

           worship, in whatever God or lack
           thereof you believe in, as long as
           it doesn't hurt others. I believe
           we should be judged as a government
           by how we take care of those who
           can't take care of themselves.
           That's my religion. If you feel
           that I'm not religious enough, then

           not experienced enough or tall

           decorated by Bush Senior from the
           first Gulf war and protested the

           that can touch this guy...so for
           this moment, this election, this
           primary is the presidential. And

           speak to you instead of me. Because
           you thought to yourself: maybe I
           can get something out of this.

           First campaign I ran tiny little
           race in Kentucky -state senate
           seat. Workin for redneck nobody
           named McGuthrie. Had no money, no
           staff, no fuckin office. Everyone
           thought we didn't stand a chance.
           There's no way we can compete. And
           about this time, a guy running a
           congressional campaign a few
           districts over gives me a call.
           Says, "I really like what you were
           able to do for poor ole' Sam. But
           let's face it, he's a goner, so why
           don't you come work for me?" What
           do I do? Well Stephen -this is
           where you and I are different. I
           told Sam about the call. And Sam
           says to me, "Paul, you think this
           other's guy's got a shot at
           winning, and he can pay you more
           than anything I can afford, so if
           it's what you feel you need to do,
           then I won't get in your way." So I
           say, "Sam -you took a chance and
           hired me when I was even more of
           nobody than you are, and I'd be
           damned if I'm gonna jump ship just
           because the shit hit the fan."
           We lost the race, but three years
           later, when Sam decided to run for
           Governor -who do you think he
           called? We won that race.(MORE)(CONTINUED)74.CONTINUED: (4)PAUL (CONT'D)And twenty years later I'm where I

          No one speaks.
          The sound man then puts and earwig into Stephens ear.SOUND MANYou should be able to hear
           them...do you hear them?
                         
          We hear the buzzing in his ear of the broadcast from New
          York.STEPHENYeah I can hear them.SOUND MANGood, quick mic check can you count
           to ten for me?
          Stephen counts to ten. Everyone stands behind the camera.
          The sound man with his headset on whispers..SOUND MAN (CONT'D)They're coming to you in about
           forty five seconds.
                         
          We sit in silence staring at Stephens face.
                         
          Ten seconds - nothing.
          Twenty seconds - nothing
                         
          This scene starts to resemble our opening - A dark auditorium
          - only a few people doing their individual jobs.
                         
          Stephen looks at two interns holding clipboards and cell
          phones.(CONTINUED)99.CONTINUED:The FIRST AD is sitting on the floor talking on his headset.

          A MAN sweeping the gym floor in the distance.
          They all seem to be staring at him. They probably aren't -
          but he feels it. The enthusiasm and excitement of Stephen
          has given over to emptiness. The price of winning at all
          cost.
                         
          We stay on Stephen's face.
                         
          We now hear the Governor's speech through Stephen's earwig.GOV. MORRISSenator Thompson I am proud that
           you have brought integrity back to
           this election. Because that's what
           this comes down to, integrity. Who
           we are. Because how we project
           ourselves to the rest of the world
           matters!...Dignity
           matters!...Integrity matters!...Our
           future depends on it!
          Forty seconds - the silence is broken by the SOUND MAN.SOUND MANComing to you in
           five...four...three...two...
                         
          Through the earwig we hear an JOHN KING.JOHN KINGWe now have Governor Morris's new
           senior campaign advisor, Stephen
           Myers, coming to us from Xavier
           University where Senator Thompson
           has just endorsed Governor Morris,
           essentially ending this primary
           race. (To Stephen) Stephen, can
           you give us some insight into how
           this whole thing unfolded?
