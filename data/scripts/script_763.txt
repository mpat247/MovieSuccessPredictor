      below. A perfect view for our guardian hero.
      
      He watches the thriving metropolis, bristling with life as
      people happily go about their day.
      
      Yet, we can't help but detect a hint of sadness in Uberman's
      expression.2.UBERMANYou look so peaceful from up here.
      
      His serenity is suddenly interrupted by a loud BEEPING SOUND
      coming from his wrist.
      
      He looks down at a BRACELET (a manly one) on his right arm.
      It's a silver band with a FLASHING red letter "U".UBERMAN (CONT'D)Looks like Roxanne's in trouble
                again.
      
      Uberman leaps off the building and into the air. His cape
      gracefully flows in the breeze behind him as he shoots off
      into the distance like a speeding bullet.EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - ESTABLISHING SHOTGrime and moss decorate the outside of this long abandoned
      building overlooking the COAST. Once a place of knowledge and
      wonder - now home to a great evil.INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAYThe inside is in complete contrast to the exterior. The huge
      hall with a GIANT TELESCOPE teems with advanced ELECTRONIC
      EQUIPMENT. Computers, monitors and machines which do not have
      an obvious function FLASH and HUM.
      
      A STEEL DOOR slides open, revealing the subject of our story
      MASTER MIND - a villainous sight to behold. His FACE IS
      INEXPLICABLY LIGHT BLUE, topped by an OVERSIZED, MUSHROOM-
      SHAPED HEAD with a CIRCULAR PATCH OF WHITE HAIR ON TOP.
      
      He's dressed in the kind of costume only a super villain
      could pull off: a PURPLE JUMPSUIT AND BLACK BOOT ENSEMBLE
      WITH A GIANT GREEN "M" ON THE CHEST. His right hand, hanging
      at his side, is a METAL GAUNTLET WITH THREE SHORT SPIKESPROTRUDING BETWEEN HIS KNUCKLES.Master Mind begins to survey the room with his TWOPERMANENTLY ARCHED EYEBROWS.A man dressed as ALBERT EINSTEIN is busy ranting to two other
      men. One, a hulking brute, is dressed as LEONARDO DA VINCI.
      The other, a small intellectual-type carrying a clip-board,
      is dressed as the philosopher PLATO.EINSTEINI hate the outfits. I mean, I get
                it: we're all supposed to be
                "masterminds" - very clever.(MORE)3.EINSTEIN(cont'd)
                I just feel stupid. I mean, what

      Einstein starts feverishly scratching his side.EINSTEINWell, you'd think he'd invent a
                wool sweater that didn't itch so
                much.
      
      Da Vinci and Plato's eyes suddenly grow with concern as they
      see Master Mind walk up behind Einstein.
      
      Einstein notices his colleague's staring over his right
      shoulder and turns around.
      
      He turns around and Master Mind SEIZES HIM BY HIS THROAT with
      his metal gauntlet.MASTER MINDThe real Einstein once said, "God
                does not play dice with the world."
                He was right, because the world is
                MY dice. Is that understood?DA VINCI & PLATOSir! Yes, sir!EINSTEIN(gasping for air)
                Yes, sir.
      
      Master Mind undoes his grip on Einstein's throat.MASTER MINDAlright, then - clean slate. Do we
                have the girl?DA VINCIYes, sir. She fell into our trap
                just like you knew she would.MASTER MINDReporters are a curious lot, and
                easily manipulated.
      
      He quickly checks his physique in a GIANT MIRROR, adjusts his
      posture and sucks in his gut.4.MASTER MINDAlright, let's not keep the lady
                waiting.MOMENTS LATERDa Vinci escorts a BLINDFOLDED and bound woman, ROXANNE
      RITCHI, to the back of the room where Plato and Einstein are
      standing guard over a large BLACK SWIVEL-CHAIR facing away
      from us.
      
      She pulls free of Da Vinci's grasp and waits for him to undo
      the blindfold.
      
      Her face uncovered, we finally see Roxanne's striking
      features - all of which seem overshadowed by piercing eyes
      that seem more put off by the situation than afraid of it.MASTER MIND (O.S.)Miss Ritchi, we meet again.
      
      The chair turns menacingly slow, finally revealing Master
      Mind.ROXANNEYou didn't need to turn around like
                that. I can recognize the stench of
                failure.
      
      Master Mind unleashes a wicked laugh.MASTER MINDI trust you gentlemen know the very
                sassy Roxanne Ritchi, highly

                friendly relationship with our
                super powered foe Uberman. And Miss

                come up with, and takes you and
                your cronies to jail. I propose we
                just save everybody some heartache
                this time by YOU letting me go, and
                ME forgetting this whole thing ever
                happened?MASTER MINDWhat about my revenge?ROXANNEWe can say it was wasting
                everyone's time.MASTER MINDYou have a wicked tongue. I hope
                you rid yourself of that when
                you're my queen.
      
      Roxanne unleashes a snort-filled laugh.ROXANNEI'm sorry. What makes you think I
                would want to be your queen?MASTER MINDPower corrupts absolutely, Miss
                Ritchi. And when I have ultimate
                power over this city, I have
                absolutely every intention of

                jail cell?
      
      Uberman starts walking toward the monitor.MASTER MIND (ON MONITOR)Actually, I wanted to share the
                experience with my oldest friend.
      
      A MECHANIZED CAGE shoots out of the floor, suddenly trapping
      Metro City's protector.
      
      Totally unfazed, our hero stares on.7.UBERMANYou can't possibly believe this
                will work.

      Master Mind turns to Roxanne who is being held by Da Vinci
      and Einstein. She almost appears a little bored.
      
      Disappointed by her lack of horror, he walks over to the
      monitor now showing Uberman trapped in the cage.8.MASTER MINDAny last words?

      at the grotesque sight before him.ROXANNE (CONT'D)You killed him!

                able to pay the bills?MASTER MINDWell, what about your mentor?TITANTell you the truth? He was kind of
                a dick. I mean, being a hero is
                dandy and all, but it's volunteer
                work. Now you've always had the
                right take on all this. I mean,
                when you rob a bank or take over
                the diamond exchange you get
                something out of it. I mean, when
                you don't get caught, which, no
                offense, isn't very often. And that
                brings me to what I wanted to
                propose to you: Who could catch you
                if I'm by your side?
      
      Perplexed by his proposal, Master Mind just stares at Titan
      awe-struck.MASTER MINDYou want to team-up?77.TITANYou got the brains, I got the
                brawn. We could even call ourselves

                this.
      
      Titan picks up a piece of POSTER BOARD off the floor and
      shows it to Master Mind.TITAN (CONT'D)I even designed us some new
                costumes.
      
      The picture is crudely drawn with magic markers and crayons.
      A big headed man (Master Mind) is standing on a plate of
      grass in a blue costume with a picture of a brain on his
      chest.
      
      Next to him, is a picture of Titan in a red costume with a
      black cape, but his chest is mysteriously blank.
      
      Titan proudly points to the two figures.TITAN (CONT'D)See, you'd be brain, so you got a
                little one on your costume, and
                then I'll have brawn on mine...once
                I figure out the best, you know,

                do you think?MASTER MINDWhat do I think?
      
      Master Mind shakes his head tiredly.MASTER MIND (CONT'D)I think you're probably the biggest
                idiot I've ever met. I mean, I
                can't believe you. All your gifts,
                all your powers, and all you want
                to use them for is your own
                financial fulfillment. You know

      disappear into the distance.DA VINCIHow'd the plan go, boss?MASTER MINDI just made myself redundant, old

      Titan walks across the lobby, drawing stares of admiration
      from all.
      
      A little girl waves to him sweetly. He gives her a good-
      natured WINK as he heads straight for the vault.
      
      The security guard watches him enter and come out with a SACKOF CASH.Sure he must be misunderstanding what's going on, the
      security guard just stares at Titan as he passes by and out

      As the security guard exits the bank, the manager stares out
      the window. His eyes suddenly grow wide with terror.

                kind. C'mon, all heros have a place

      Roxanne can hardly believe what she's telling him.ROXANNEWayne Scott's.
      
      Master Mind shoots up out of his chair.MASTER MINDWayne Scott? Uberman was Wayne
                Scott!? Wayne Scott, the wealthy
                philanthropist? But he disappeared -ROXANNE(interrupting)
                He disappeared just over two months
                ago when you killed him. Not only
                did you rid the world of a hero,
                you killed a kind, noble, generous
                man.
      
      Perhaps ashamed, the super villain hangs his head.
      
      Master Mind walks behind Roxanne and undoes her bonds.
      
      Rubbing her wrists, she watches him as he walks over to the
      door.92.ROXANNE (CONT'D)Looks like you got what you always
                wanted. Uberman is out of the
                picture and Metro City is doomed.
      
      He grabs the door knob and stops, considering her words.MASTER MIND"Metro City doomed." You know, I
                never thought I'd say something
                like this, but here it goes -
      
      He slowly turns to her, CUE HEROIC MUSIC.MASTER MIND (CONT'D)Not if I have anything to say about
                it.EXT. WAYNE SCOTT'S MANSION - NIGHTMaster Mind stands before the huge, Gothic structure in awe.MASTER MINDSuch a dark place for one such as
                you. I wonder, underneath your

                drove you to your endless crusade
                for justice?
      
      He walks to the front entrance. The double doors have been
      sealed shut with boards and nails. Master Mind begins to tear
      them off with his metal hand.INT. WAYNE SCOTT'S MANSION - NIGHTThe doors opens. A beam of moonlight immediately pierces the
      darkness, forming an illuminated path into the heart of the
      manor.
      
      Master Mind enters.
      
      Covered in dust and cobwebs, the hall looks like a gigantic
      crypt.MASTER MINDGood lord, man. You've only been
                dead for two months.
      
      Master Mind walks, coming to a gigantic painted PORTRAIT OF
      WAYNE SCOTT. He stops to reverently admire the image of his
      fallen foe.93.MASTER MIND (CONT'D)A disguise so simple, it's
                 ingenious. No wonder I never caught
                 on.
      
      Besides the Armani suit, there's nothing to hide the fact
      that this is the same person as Uberman. In the picture, he's
      even standing in the same cheesy, heroic pose with his fists
      on his hips.MASTER MIND (CONT'D)Two lives, yet in both you were an
                 ideal. Perhaps it was you who was
                 victorious in the end, old friend.
      
      A BONGING sound suddenly bellows through the dark halls.
      
      Master Mind comes to a grandfather clock standing next to a
      gigantic BOOKCASE.
      
      On the twelfth bong it falls silent.
      
      Master Mind begins to slide it across the floor until he
      hears a loud CLICK.
      
      The bookcase slides into the wall, REVEALING A HIDDENPASSAGE.MASTER MIND (CONT'D)I'll miss how predictable you were.
      
      The passage way leads Master Mind to a WORKING ESCALATOR.
      
      Master Mind gets off the escalator to see a long hallway with
      stone walls.
      
      He begins to hear strange SOUNDS, almost like MUFFLED
      SCREAMS, coming from a doorway at the end of the hallway.
      
      Master Mind starts walking towards it. As he steps closer, he
      begins to notice a light cracking through the bottom of the
      door.MASTER MIND (CONT'D)Hello? Anyone here...besides..all
                 the BIG MEN who are with me now?

                The man was a boy scout, not a
                serial killer.
      
      He opens the door to his immediate amazement.
      
      It's some kind of screening room. A PROJECTOR shoots an image
      onto A DIRTY WHITE SCREEN hanging on the wall. BEER CANS
      litter the floor; a table in front of a ripped-up couch is
      covered in discarded snack goods; and a Kiss Pinball machine
      stands in the far corner next to a CLOSED DOOR.
      
      Master Mind turns his attention to the action on the screen.SCREENA woman dressed in a leather DOMINATRIX OUTFIT is whipping an
      overweight man lying on a swing-like device with his butt
      sticking out.DOMINATRIX IN FILMYOU ARE A WORM!She whips him three times. The man CRIES out in pain.FAT MAN IN FILMPINEAPPLE!!! PINEAPPLE!!!Master Mind's eyes are transfixed on the disturbing imagery.
      
      The door by the pinball machine suddenly swings open.
      
      WAYNE SCOTT, dressed in raggedy sweats, steps into the room
      carrying a CAN OF BEER and a bowl of JIFFY-POP.
      
      Master Mind cannot believe his horrified eyes.MASTER MINDAhhhhhh!
      
      Wayne Scott is just as startled.WAYNE SCOTTJesus!
      
      He drop his drink and snack to the floor.
      
      The two men stare at each other as they struggle to regain
      their normal breathing patterns.
      
      Wayne Scott walks over to the couch, brushes off a thick
      layer of chip crumbs, and sits down.WAYNE SCOTT (CONT'D)What the hell are you doing here?95.MASTER MINDI might just ask you the same
                question. I had thought I
                incinerated you.WAYNE SCOTTYou scared the bejesus out of me.

                identity!?MASTER MINDRoxanne told me. As for your ruse,
                I forgot to line the bottom of the
                copper cage - Somebody pointed that
                out to me recently. Figured if they
                could do it, so could you. But one
                thing I couldn't figure out -WAYNE SCOTTThe skeleton? Something I
                "borrowed" from a medical school a
                few months before.MASTER MINDA few months? How long had you been
                planning this?WAYNE SCOTTI always planned to retire -
                eventually. I mean, come on, you
                can't do this sort of thing in your
                fifties. You'd just look
                ridiculous.
      
      The pieces of the puzzle appear to be coming together in

      Wayne rises to his feet, waving his hands for Master Mind to
      say no more.WAYNE SCOTTI don't want to hear about it.

      A distant MECHANIZED RUMBLE can be heard. The noise rises,

      Titan and his crew walk out to the center of the plaza as the
      sound becomes almost deafening.A TANK TRACKas it moves over the street. We PULL BACK to see a whole line

      mounted GATLING-GUN is turning toward him.

      Titan throws the can up and slaps it with the palm of his
      hand.
