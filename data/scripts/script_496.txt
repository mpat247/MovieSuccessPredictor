                         angles, the house is different colours. 
                         You stand at the front door and the

               probably after they made love)JUSTINEHolden gave me two of his stories to 
                         read. It's like what a story would be. 
                         I was about a boy who was put upon, 
                         his mother was cold and selfish, and 
                         his father wanted him to play football. 
                         Other people didn't get him, especially 
                         girls. Then the boy comes to believe 
                         no one can ever really know him. So 
                         he starts actin' out, drinkin', and 
                         doin' all kinds of drugs. At the end 
                         the boy kills himself but jumpin' over 
                         abridge. The second story was pretty 
                         much the same as the first. Except at 
                         the end, the boy kills himself by drinkin' 
                         a bottle of bug poison.JUSTINEYour stories are intense.HOLDENI just wanna leave some kind of legacy. 
                         Somethin' great. After that I don't 
                         care what happens to me.JUSTINEDon't say that. I wish there was a story 
                         about me. I don't know who would read 
                         it though.HOLDENI would.JUSTINEI like this. I like havin' a secret.

                         terrible and shocking news. One of our 
                         best employees, Gwen Jackson, died yesterday. 
                         Gwen was a real class act. She had a 
                         good attitude, she had ideas. We're 
                         all gonna miss her. Now, if any of y'all 
                         need to collect you thoughts and remember 
                         Gwen. GWEN, then today's the day. You'll 
                         be excused from work and we'll just 
                         have to do without you. Gwen, this one's 
                         for you.(music comes over PA)JUSTINEHolden had the notion to go to Gabler's 
                         Creek, skinny dippin' and makin' love. 
                         He said we'd be like Adam and Eve, rollin' 
                         around around in the sticks and the 
                         dirt and bein' one with nature. He was 
                         so fixed on the idea thateven when the 
                         clouds started rollin' in, and the sky 
                         was gettin; dark, he kept on swimmin'. 
                         All my thoughts turned to death. I thought 
                         of Gwen's body, rottin' away. I thought 
                         of how nice a person she was, so full 
                         of life and good will. If there was 
                         a heaven, Gwen would be there. Givin' 
                         makeovers and offerin' up helpful advice. 
                         I thought if I died today, what would 
                         happen to me? A hateful girl. A selfish 
                         girl. An adultress.

                         Bitz! Come on in. I wanna show you somethin'. 
                         Sit. (Yells at dog again) I'm in shock.JUSTINEWhy?BUBBAYou know why.JUSTINEBubba sat like that for what seemed 
                         like ten years before he began to speak. 
                         Finally, when he opened his mouth, he 
                         talked a blue streak about the ruin 
                         that was his life. He talked about how 
                         he loved Phil, and how he loved me. 
                         And how he always wanted a girlfriend 
                         just like me, and to be a guy like Phil, 
                         to this imaginary girl like me, that 
                         he never found. Then he wen on about 
                         givin' up your dreams and how it's all 
                         a part of gettin' older. Bubba had given 
                         up on his dream to be like Phil, and 
                         accepted his fate as Bubba, always and 
                         forever. Then, last week, a door that 
                         remained shut swung wide open. Bubba 
                         thought this no chance coincidence, 
                         a cosmic force was at work. The sounds 
                         of me makin' love to a man that wasn't 
                         Phil was like a shout in Bubba's ear 
                         from the creator himself. What it meant, 
                         or what to do, or why Bubba didn't know. 
                         All he knew was that he hated me for 
                         poisoning the well of idealism that 
                         he had drunk from for so long. I was 
                         no longer Bubba's image of perfection. 
                         To him I was just a liar, and a whore, 
                         and that sickened him. But on the other 
                         hand he loved me for opening his eyes 
                         and releasing him from the bitter chains 
                         of evny that bound him to Phil. Phil 
                         was no superman, just a cuckhold, and 
                         a foll, and that was beautiful. Bubba 
                         felt that there was just one thing left 
                         for us to do. Something that would solve 
                         both our problems and end this whole 
                         tragic cycle.JUSTINEBubba, I am not gonna sleep with you.BUBBABut don't you see? This is my chance, 
                         for liberation.JUSTINEBut, one person's liberation is another 
                         person's, well, badness. There's just 
                         no way.BUBBAI'm gonna have to tell Phil then.JUSTINEWhy?BUBBAHe's my best friend. I can't keep him 
                         in the dark about somethin' this big. 
                         He's a cuckhold.JUSTINEYou wanna cuckhold him yourself!BUBBAWell that's different. That isn't about 
                         him. That's about my salvation. Look, 
                         you've got your choice to make. Either 
                         destroy your marriage, and break your 
                         husband's heart. Or have sex with me 
                         right now.(Bubba is yelling at the dog again, and saying Justine's name)JUSTINEOh god! There was someone in the window! 
                         Did you not see?BUBBAYou're paranoid.JUSTINEI gotta go.BUBBAPhil is never gonna find out about any 
                         of this. Don't fret. (the dog is still 
                         barking)JUSTINEGet this damn dog away from me!BUBBAYou're lookin' at a free man, Justine. 
                         A free man.JUSTINEGreat. Good for you.BUBBAThank you. (Yelling at dog again.)(TV sounds as Phil comes out of the bathroom, still brushing 
               his teeth)PHILI'm nervous.JUSTINEYou're nervous? Why?PHIL'Cause I gotta go to that doctor tomorrow 
                         and jism into a cup, that's why. What

               in the car, more depressed than ever.)JUSTINEOh my god. What are you doin'?HOLDENYou're a hooker, you hooker.JUSTINEI saw you. You followed me.HOLDENSo, how many guys you gettin' with?

                         He had me over a barrel. If I didn't

                         the road to my right. I closed my eyes 
                         and tried to peer into the future. On 
                         my left I saw days upon days of lipstick 
                         and ticking clocks. Dirty looks and 
                         quiet whisperings. and burning secrets

                         a thief and a disturbed young man, and 
                         what happened was a sad thing. Perhaps

                         for me. It was kinda different from 
                         the other one, but kinda the same. It
