                                 Peter Baynham10/16/09EXT. MANHATTAN - NIGHTA HOMELESS MAN, who from his tatty suit may have been a top
          broker this time last year, is picking through a bin in
          Manhattan's deserted night-time financial district.
                         
          The street starts to vibrate. A TERRIFYING GROWL approaches.
                         
          A huge black shape smashes into view - THE DARK KNIGHT'S
          BATMOBILE! Our audience wonder if they've wandered into the
          wrong movie. The Homeless Man dives for cover.
                         
          BAM! The Batmobile smashes into a row of parked cars.
                         
          We hear manic laughing from inside the car, which screeches
          and careers violently into a sign reading `WALL STREET'.
                         
          Sirens herald THREE POLICE CARS in hot pursuit.
                         
          The Batmobile roars up Wall Street, bashing against the New
          York Stock Exchange, thumping up and down the Federal Hall's
          steps and finally smashing at high speed into the rear end of
          the famous 'Charging Bull' statue. Two enormous bronze
          testicles thud onto the Batmobile's bonnet and roll away.
                         
          The cop cars screech up, surrounding the Batmobile. TWO OLDER
          COPS and A ROOKIE surround it, weapons drawn.
                         
          A HELICOPTER appears, blazing the Batmobile in white light.ROOKIE COPCooool.
                         
          An older Cop flashes the rookie a dirty look, then points a
          FLASHLIGHT into a tiny window. THE BATMAN - actually drunken
          English socialite ARTHUR BACH TEMPLEMEAD in a costume -
          lowers the window and offers a handshake.ARTHUREvening, Constable!OLDER COP 1(seen it all before)
           Hi, Arthur.ARTHURAre you familiar with the
           expression `I can explain
           everything'?OLDER COP 1Out of the car, please.2.ARTHURTerribly sorry, but in the film
           they used a different model to show
           the old Batchap getting in and out.
           This one has no doors, so I'd have
           to squeeze out the back arsehole
           first. Which nobody wants...(TO COP 2)Apart from you, cheeky monkey!(BEAT)It's a joke! Okay, okay.
                         
          Arthur wriggles awkwardly out of a rear hatch. The bronze
          bull teeters, a little scarily. He stands, wobbly. His Batman
          utility belt features a big water pistol, a firework, a hip
          flask and line of shot glasses. And, inexplicably, a big red
          stapler. The younger cop is desperately fighting the giggles.OLDER COP 1Okay, explain everything.ARTHURWell. What with having spunked 1.6
           million fat Alberts on this little
           runaround, I thought why not take
           it a step further and try to
           actually collar a few ne-er do
           wells? It worked for the
           billionaire Bruce Wayne, why not
           the future billionaire Arthur Bach-
           Templemead? Will I have to do
           traffic school?OLDER COP 2How much have you drunk, Arthur?ARTHURTo use the technical medical term -
           megabloodyshitloads. Either that or
           I've had a stroke! But fret not, I
           have a designated driver.
                         
          The cop shines his flashlight back inside, revealing A
          BEARDED HOMELESS OLD MAN IN A CRAPPY 60S `ROBIN' costume.HOMELESS ROBINWhere's my five thousand dollars?
