          the sounds of laughter and music, we MOVE IN ON:INT NEWSPAPER OFFICE- DAYAn office Xmas party in progress, not a pretty sight: tipsy
          receptionists laugh and spill drinks on the rug, red-faced
          reporters loosen their belts and burp cocktail weiners...MOVING QUICKLY THROUGH THE PARTY TO AN OPEN OFFICE DOOR.Arriving just in time for the door to SLAM in our face.INT OFFICE- DAYA woman stomps back over to her desk and picks up her pen.
          MEET CASSIDY DALEY (dirty blond, striking, manic energy). Ink-
          stained fingers, notepads in every pocket: Cass doesn't have
          time for office parties, she's working.Her door cracks open and STEWART (almost as good looking as
          he thinks he is) appears, holding a Kahlua bottle.CASSI'm working, Stewart.STEWARTCome on, take a break. (enticing)
                    I've got Kahlua...Cass picks up a stapler and LAUNCHES it at Stewart's head.
          Stewart DUCKS OUT just in time. The phone rings. Answering:CASSCassidy Daley. Talk to me.JIMMY (O.S.)It's Jimmy. Tell me you love me.CASSDepends on what you got.JIMMY (O.S.)I've got a confirmed place and
                    time.Cass is on her feet, excited.CASSI love you! So, when? Where?2.JIMMY (O.S.)You think I'm gonna say this shit
                    over the phone? I could get killed.
                    Just meet me at the usual place.
                    Oh, and Cass? This one's gonna cost
                    an extra hundred.CLICK. He hangs up. Cass drops the phone, grabs her stuff.INT NEWSPAPER OFFICE- DAYCass races for the elevator, Stewart hot on her heels:STEWARTWhere ya going?CASSHooters. I go there for the hot
                    wings.STEWARTPlease. Nobody goes there for the
                    hot wings. You got a tip.CASSYou got a hundred bucks on you?Stewart considers this, then hands her 5 20's.STEWARTNow are you gonna let me in on it?CASSSorry. No can do. I have to protect
                    my source.STEWARTYou know what? We need to talk
                    about our relationship.CASSWe don't have a relationship. We
                    made out 3 years ago in the copy
                    room. I was drunk. I was broken-
                    hearted. I would have made out with
                    the xerox machine.STEWARTYes, but you made out with me.CASSI have to go.3.She exits. He shouts after her:STEWARTI want in on that story!EXT STREET/JERSEY CITY- DAYCass driving like a maniac, doing the one thing she loves:TRACKING A STORY...EXT DUNKING DONUTS PARKING LOT- DAYMOVING IN ON- A BEAT-UP HONDA CIVIC (JIMMY'S CAR) IN THE BACKCORNER OF THE LOT...INT JIMMY'S CAR- DAYJIMMY (20's, goatee, Mets baseball hat, nervous) sits in his
          car, rolling a cigarette while he waits for Cass.Jimmy puts the cigarette in his mouth and pulls out a
          lighter. Just as he flips the lighter open, HIS FRONTWINDSHIELD EXPLODES. A MAN HOLDING A TIRE IRON (MAHLER,heavyset, crew-cut, rarely speaks, all business) reaches
          through the broken window, AND DRAGS JIMMY OUT OF THE CAR...EXT DUNKING DONUTS PARKING LOT- DAYCass drives into the lot and pulls up next to Jimmy's car.CASSHey, Jimmy, I...She realizes he is not in the car. THEN SHE SEES THE BROKENGLASS ALL OVER THE DRIVER'S SEAT.CASSJimmy?SCREECHING TIRES behind her. Cass glances up and sees JIMMY'S
          BASEBALL HAT IN THE BACK WINDOW OF A GREY CHEVY. The Chevy is
          racing out into traffic. Cass throws her car into reverse...INT CASS' CAR- DAYCass tries to follow the grey Chevy, but GETS STUCK AT A RED
          LIGHT. Shit. She looks around, decides fuck it, and HITS THE
          GAS. Her car leaps into the intersection. SIRENS.4.Cass looks into her rearview mirror: A PATROL CAR IS RIGHT
          BEHIND HER, signalling for her to pull over. Up ahead, the
          Chevy is getting away.Cass debates: pull over? Or follow the story? No contest. SHESLAMS ON THE GAS AND HER CAR SURGES OUT OF FRAME...EXT STREET- DAYCass' car SPEEDS down the street, A COP CAR IN CLOSEPURSUIT...INT CASS' CAR- DAYCass is losing sight of the Chevy. She races around traffic
          and is suddenly HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THE SIDE OF A MOVING VAN.
          She panics, WRENCHING the wheel to the right...EXT STREET- DAYCASS' CAR JUMPS THE CURB, CROSSES A LAWN, AND SKIDS TO A HALTON THE FRONT STEPS OF A CHURCH. THE COP CAR RACES UP ANDBLOCKS HER IN.EXT CHURCH- MOMENTS LATERCass is out of her car now, arguing with a cop who has her by
          the arm:CASSLet go of me, I'm a reporter, I'm
                    warning you...The cop pulls her towards his squad car. Cass leans over and
          SINKS HER TEETH INTO THE COP'S HAND. The cop screams.FREEZE FRAME.CHIRON: "24 HOURS LATER"CLOSE ON- A NEWSPAPER COLUMN WITH CASS' PHOTO: windswept
          hair, head tilted coyly, smile that says "I'm on top of the
          world. Beneath the photo, the byline: "CASSIDY DALEY".Someone whistles "We Wish You a Merry Xmas" as a MARKER
          improves on the photo: MOUSTACHE, BUCK-TEETH, PIMPLES. Then a
          MATCH enters frame, and SETS THE PHOTO ON FIRE.VOICEMilo!5.PULL BACK TO REVEAL:INT CRYSTAL'S BAR/JERSEY CITY- LATE AFTERNOONHolding the flaming photo, MEET MILO: rumpled shirt, messy
          hair, looks like he slept on the floor. The bartender
          (CRYSTAL, 50's, Eastern European) scowls at him:CRYSTALWhat did I say about the fires?MILOYou said "please set fires in my
                    bar". Wait, no, that's not right.
                    "Please don't set fires in my bar".
                    (off her look) Ok, jeez, you try to
                    get in the holiday spirit...He drops the flaming photo to the floor, pours his drink on
          it, then GRINDS IT TO PIECES WITH HIS SHOE.CRYSTALShouldn't you be working?MILOThat's the beauty of my job,
                    Crystal. Tracking down idiots is
                    something you can do pretty much
                    anywhere. See, there's one...He points to A DRUNK DRAPED OVER THE JUKEBOX, MOURNFULLYSINGING ALONG TO CHRISTINA AQUILLERA'S "I AM BEAUTIFUL".MILOAnd there's another one...Pointing to A WOMAN TRYING TO RIP A PAY PHONE FROM THE WALL.MILOAnd there's...Glances at the TV, which is showing LIVE FOOTAGE OF AN XMAS
          PARADE. Looks closer, recognizes someone, groans:MILOI don't believe it. That idiot. (to
                    Crystal) Save my seat.Tosses back his drink and SPLITS.6.EXT CRYSTAL'S BAR- LATE AFTERNOONMilo climbs into a Cadillac: dents, patches of rust, cracked
          windshield, bumper askew.RACK TO: half a block away, A DARK SEDAN IDLES AT THE CURB.INT DARK SEDAN- LATE AFTERNOONThe man behind the wheel (DWIGHT, large, babyfaced, Metallica
          t-shirt) eats a hoagie as he watches Milo get into his car.DWIGHTThere you are, you dipshit.He takes a last bite then tosses the sandwich and pulls away
          from the curb, tailing the Cadillac.EXT JERSEY CITY- LATE AFTERNOONMOVE IN ON- the parade we just saw on TV. Baton twirlers in
          Santa Hats. Men dressed like reindeer, pulling a sleigh. A
          boys choir singing "Joy to the World", the kids dressed like
          orphans that escaped a Broadway musical.A beautiful scene, if you like that sort of thing.RACK TO- the Cadillac, half a block away, cruising sideways
          into a spot just beneath a "TEMPORARY TOW-AWAY" sign. MILO
          climbs out of the car. Shoves his way through the crowd to
          the curb, cracking open a can of Pabst.Milo does not like this sort of thing. He scans the crowd
          impatiently.Meanwhile, THE CAR THAT WAS FOLLOWING HIM parks half a block
          away. DWIGHT emerges and heads for:MILO, who has just found what he's looking for. The reindeer
          are passing him and he makes eye contact with RUDOLPH, who
          does a double-take.MILOYeah, you. Rudolph. Come here, you
                    fucking ding-dong.Milo takes a step towards Rudolph and DWIGHT APPEARS INMILO'S PATH, BLOCKING HIM.DWIGHTWe have to stop meeting this way.7.MILONot now, Dwight.DWIGHTYou owe my boss money.MILO(LAUGHING)Hey, I owe everybody money.Suddenly, DWIGHT PUNCHES MILO IN THE GUT. Milo doubles-up,
          gasping, then BRINGS HIS HEAD UP QUICK, CATCHING DWIGHT ON
          THE CHIN. Dwight goes flying sideways and MEETS A POLICE
          BARRIER FACE-FIRST. Ouch.The barrier tips over, knocking over the one next to it. THE
          REST GO LIKE DOMINOS. Milo turns to see that RUDOLPH HAS
          DISAPPEARED. Then he catches sight of the ANTLERS, working
          their way through the crowd. Milo lunges after him and
          Rudolph drags other reindeer with him as he tries to avoid
          Milo. THE SLEIGH FLIPS. Santa tumbles from the sled. PACKAGESRAIN DOWN ON REINDEER LIKE SHRAPNEL.All of a sudden, IT'S THE XMAS FROM HELL: BLOODY REINDEERSTUMBLING AROUND, SANTA UNCONSCIOUS IN THE GUTTER, KIDSSCREAMING, PARENTS PANICKING. Meanwhile, MILO IS GAINING ON
          RUDOLPH, who picks up one of the packages and throws it. IT
          CRACKS MILO IN THE HEAD. Just what Milo has been waiting for:MILO(BEAMING)I am so happy you did that.Milo TACKLES RUDOLPH TO THE GROUND. Around them, people
          scream and scatter. One boy bursts into tears:BOYThat man is killing Rudolph!SIRENS. Uh-oh. Cops SWARM the scene, surrounding Milo and
          Rudolph, GUNS DRAWN. The LEAD COP (GELMAN, short, over-
          zealous) steps forward:GELMANRelease the reindeer!Release the reindeer? Milo looks around. He's got 8 or so
          guns pointed his way and Rudolph gasping at his feet. MILO
          STARTS TO LAUGH. Gelman bristles:GELMANHands behind your head, asshole!8.MILOTake it easy, skippy, I'm just
                    doing my job.Milo flashes his ID. Gelman inspects it, rolls his eyes.GELMANBounty hunter. Figures. Why don't
                    you get a real job?MILOSo I can be like you patrol boys
                    and sit around all day with my
                    thumb up my ass?Gelman turns bright red.GELMANWhat did you just say?Suddenly, a sergeant (BOBBY, late 30's, obnoxious but
          likeable, Milo's ex-partner) marches onto the scene, takes
          one look at Milo and laughs.BOBBYMilo Boyd. I shoulda known.GELMANSarg, you know this asshole?BOBBYYeah. I know this asshole. Guy used
                    to be one of us.RACK TO- DWIGHT, NOSE BLEEDING, MELTING BACK INTO SHADOW...EXT STREET- MOMENTS LATERMilo drags Rudolph through the crowd towards his car. Bobby
          follows, shaking his head, bemused expression on his face.BOBBYLook, Milo, I know this is a tough
                    time of year for you...MILOThis isn't a tough time of year for
                    me. It's Christmas. Who doesn't
                    love Christmas?BOBBY...and I try to be sensitive to
                    your situation...9.MILOWhat situation? Being a man who
                    works his own hours and has his
                    freedom and lives the high life?BOBBY...because I realize you're
                    unhappy.MILOUnhappy? Are you kidding me, Bob?
                    Look at me: I'm the happiest man
                    alive.Just then, they come to where Milo left his car. IT'S GONE.
          Bobby squints at the huge "TOW-AWAY" sign:BOBBYThat sign is pretty hard to see.And with that, Milo loses it:MILOAAAHHH!He rips the sign off the pole. Stomps on it. Kicks it. Tries
          to shred it with his teeth. Hmm. He doesn't really seem like
          the happiest man alive. Rudolph, to Bobby:RUDOLPHTake me to jail. Please?INT BOBBY'S CAR- EARLY EVENINGBobby's car is decorated with photos of his many children,
          all of whom look exactly like him, even the girls, poor kids.Milo's in front by Bobby, Rudolph's handcuffed in the back.BOBBYOk, I got one for ya: why doesn't
                    Santa have any children? Cause he
                    only comes once a year and when he
                    does, it's down a chimney.Rudolph snickers. Milo does not. Bobby glances at Milo.BOBBYSo. Have you talked to her lately?MILOTalked to who?10.BOBBYKatie Couric, motherfucker, who do
                    you think?MILOI haven't talked to her in three
                    years, why would I talk to her now?BOBBYWell, for one thing, so you can
                    stop taking out your rage on
                    innocent bystanders.RUDOLPH(piping up from the back)
                    Talk to her, man. For real.Milo reaches back, gags Rudolph with his own scarf.BOBBYDo what you want. But this kind of
                    shit will eat a hole in your
                    intestines, you don't deal with it.EXT POLICE STATION/JERSEY CITY- EARLY EVENINGThey pull up. Milo exits the car, pulls Rudolph from the
          back. Bobby leans out.BOBBYHey, why don't you come by the
                    precinct tomorrow for our Xmas
                    bash?MILOI'm not invited. I'm not a cop
                    anymore, remember?BOBBYFuck that, I'm inviting you.MILOI don't know, Bob. I'm sorta busy.BOBBYThat's what I'm worried about.
                    (sighing) Just...take it easy, Ok?Bobby really seems worried, but Milo waves him off. Bobby
          drives over, parks by other cop cars. Gets out, mingles with
          some cops. Laughter, inside jokes. Milo watches from afar.11.RUDOLPHYou should go to that party, man.
                    Seriously. You need it.MILODo I look like I need advice from a
                    grown man in antlers?Milo gags Rudolph and drags him into the station.FADE TO BLACK. OVER BLACK:VOICEMilo. Hey. Princess...INT SID'S BAIL BONDS/JERSEY CITY- MORNINGHazy pieces: a tilting clock on the wall. A battered metal
          desk. Filing cabinets, spitting up papers. A man, SID (wound
          sorta tight, Milo's best friend) peers down at us:SIDYou're drooling on my sofa.Milo unsticks his face from the leather couch, wobbles
          upright. Are the walls throbbing, or is it just him?SIDYou do have an apartment, don't
                    you? With a bed of some kind?Milo grunts. Sid hands him a coffee.SIDHeard you shut down 5th Street
                    yesterday. Gave every kid in the
                    county the gift of nightmares.MILOHey, I'm a giving kind of guy.
                    Anyway, what do you care? I brought
                    your guy in, right?Milo holds out his hand, palm up. Sid COUNTS MONEY INTO HISPALM.EXT SID'S BAIL BONDS/JERSEY CITY- MORNINGSwearing under his breath, Sid is trying to stuff a Xmas tree
          into the back of a station wagon. At least half of the tree
          is hanging out of the back. Milo drinks a beer and watches.12.SIDYou gonna give me a hand, or just
                    stand there killing your liver?MILOIs that a trick question?Sid glares at him. Milo sighs, puts down his beer, and grabs
          part of the tree.SIDSo I told her, fine, I'd handle
                    Xmas this year. I mean, what's to
                    handle? You buy a tree, some gifts,
                    cook a ham, hang some lights. An
                    idiot could do it.MILOWell, we'll soon find out.Sid checks him out.SIDYou have plans for the holiday?MILOThe usual.SIDGonna drink some cheap whiskey and
                    put your fist through a wall?MILOJealous?The tree is definitely not going to fit. They let it go, and
          Sid pulls out a small hand saw.SIDThen forget it.MILOForget what?SIDI've got an open bond, but your
                    thing sounds like more fun. I'll
                    give it to Doug instead.Sid starts hacking away at the tree.13.MILOWhoa. Hold up, Heidi. What the
                    fuck. I want the job, I'm in the
                    hole.SIDYou're always in the hole.MILOWhat's your point?SID(SIGHING)The truth is, I'm not sure you're
                    the right person for this job. It
                    could be a total disaster. On the
                    other hand, when one friend sees
                    another friend stagnating in his
                    own filth, he has to do something,
                    right?MILOHey. I just woke up. I was gonna
                    shower.Sid drops the saw. With one final shove, the tree is in.
          Phew. Sid slams the back shut.SIDOk. But remember: you asked for it.He reaches into his pocket and extracts A FOLDED PIECE OF
          PAPER. Hands it to Milo. Milo unfolds it, gives it a quick
          look. A second look. A third.TIME STOPS. THE WHOLE STREET GOES SILENT.MILONo.SIDYes.MILONo.SIDYes.MILONo.SIDAre we done yet?14.MILOIs this a joke? Because if it is,
                    I'm gonna have to kill you.SIDIt's not a joke.MILOShe got arrested? And then she
                    jumped bail?SIDApparently the whole thing started
                    with some reckless driving, and
                    ended with her assaulting a police
                    officer.Milo gives him a questioning look.SID(EXPLAINING)She bit him.Milo snorts.MILOYeah. That sounds like her.
                    But here's my question: why the
                    hell did you post her bail?SIDHey, I know she dumped you...MILOWhoa. She did not "dump me".SID(QUICKLY)Ok, whatever, I...MILONo, not "whatever". I dumped her.SIDThe point is, I'm aware you guys
                    have issues, but I'm running a
                    business here. A person needs bail,
                    I don't have time to check with you
                    first.MILOWell, had you checked with me
                    first, you wouldn't be out of a
                    bond right now.15.SIDI'm not out of a bond if you go
                    pick her up. It's five grand to
                    bring her back by 9am, Xmas day.MILO(SLOWLY)You're telling me it's five grand
                    to go pick up my ex-wife and bring
                    her to jail. (beat) On Xmas.SIDYou're a good listener.Milo takes a deep, calming breath. Then he EXPLODES into
          whoops and hollers. He throws himself into a snow bank and
          thrashes around. He does a Fred Astaire around a lamp post.SIDI take it you're interested.Milo grabs Sid and pulls him into a crushing bear hug.MILOI love you! You're the best friend
                    a guy could ever have!SIDOk, take it easy...TERESA (mid 40's, overly made-up, popping gum) pokes her head
          out the front door:TERESASid, you got a DUI on line one.
                    (off their looks) What's going on?Milo drops Sid, grabs Teresa, and gives HER A LONG, INTENSE
          KISS. He releases her. She stumbles back a bit.TERESAOk. (beat) Can I have my gum back?MILORight. Sorry.He reaches into his mouth, extracts her gum and hands it to
          her. She retreats back inside. Milo beams at Sid.MILOYou know what this is, don't you?
                    Karma! Payback! You know how they
                    say "What goes around comes
                    around"? Turns out it's true!(MORE)16.MILO (cont'd)
                    (checking the paper) That middle
                    initial stands for Rhonda, by the
                    way. She tells people it stands for
                    "Rachel", but that's a lie.Sid shakes his head.SIDI can't believe you guys broke up
                    over a stupid article.MILOWe didn't break up over a stupid
                    article. We broke up because she is
                    a cheating, manipulative liar.SIDAre you sure you can handle this?MILOWhy wouldn't I be able to handle
                    this?SIDLet's face it: you're not exactly
                    rational around her. I mean, if I
                    was a cop working a case and some
                    reporter came snooping around, I'd

          looks at him and she starts laughing too.CASSDirty fighter.MILOMe? I'm the dirty fighter?They both laugh harder. Then Milo stands and offers her a
          hand. She takes it, and he helps her up. Awkward pause as

                       the evidence on a boat, drive the
                       boat about 30 miles out, and blow

                    say.Bobby quickly frisks Cass, and frisks and disarms Milo. He

                    asshole, Milo. You just don't
                    listen. All you had to do was stay
                    where I told you and none of this
                    would have happen. Now the two of
