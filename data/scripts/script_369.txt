          make up the central hub of Laughter, Colorado. She'd be a
          ghost town ‘cept the ghosts considered her a shithole ages
          ago and baled. The buck ten for leaded sign gives us an idea
          how long ago this place went dry.
          Suddenly an old Chevy RIPS around the corner, wheels sending
          PLUMES of dust skyward.INT. OLD CHEVY - DAYThree grimy looking fuckers are stuffed into the cab.
          FUCKING DRIVER looks as though he may piss himself. FUCKING
          MIDDLE twists around, glares through the back glass and

          we lost him.EXT. LAUGHTER - MAIN STREET - DAYThey race through the dusty derelict little town, peeling for
          the main road in the distance when they round a corner --
          --to face a ‘70 PLYMOUTH ROADRUNNER, beat to shit, engine
          screaming. SPEEDING head on. This ain't chicken because
          these three Fuckers don't even have time to react before:MILTON“The Old Man”, shock of white hair, drives the Roadrunner,
          locks the tires and spins the wheel.
          The Roadrunner fishtails, slides sideways AT THEM!
          The truck's gonna ram the driver's side. At least it wouldBUT:MILTON AIMS A SHOTGUN through the driver's side window.
          Fearless. Pissed off. He FIRES!2.The shot BLOOMS right at us! Then SLOWS TO NEAR FROZEN -
          Hanging in mid-air - suspended, like we could touch it:
          TITLE CARD appears--"DRIVE ANGRY"--then the shot BURSTS through the title! SHATTERING the
          words right at us!ANOTHER ANGLE...EXPLODING into the hood of the Chevy! The hood RIPS up,
          SLAMS the windshield.
          Truck CAREENS out of control!
          Milton GUNS the Roadrunner away from truck...but...
          KRAACK - The Truck nails the Roadrunner's rear quarter panel.
          Roadrunner and truck go into a spin. A tornado of dust
          SWIRLS around the two vehicles.
          The Roadrunner SPLINTERS into a boarded store front!
          The Truck HITS a ditch and UPENDS. Flips. SLAMS into the
          dirt on its roof, wheels SPINNING.ANOTHER ANGLESmoke HISSES from the totalled Roadrunner. Door creeks open.
          Milton emerges slow and sure. He crosses toward the Chevy.
          Fucking Passenger rises from behind the truck and rushes
          Milton, tire iron held high over his head!
          Milton spins and KUH-FOOM!
          --blows Fucking Passenger's hand clean off! Passenger
          screams as Milton snatches the iron out of the air and --KER-ACK!-- slams it across his face! Passenger drops. Hard.
          Milton stoops, removes Passenger's wallet, digs the cash out.OVER MILTON'S SHOULDERFucking Driver scrambles from behind the wheel, springs to
          his feet and runs.3.Milton spins, BLOWS his knee apart from 20 paces. Driver
          SCREAMS and face-firsts the cracked pavement.ANOTHER ANGLEAs Fucking Middle drags himself from the passenger side. He
          got the worst of it. Looks like his face went through the
          windshield. He looks up --
          -- into the barrel of Milton's shotgun. A beat.FUCKING MIDDLEI'll never tell you where they've
          taken her...NEVER.MILTONI know.
          The EXPLOSION vaporizes what's left of his face.ON FUCKING DRIVERAs he tries to stand but his lower leg dangles from a piece
          of cartilage. He falls, WRITHES on the ground. He looks up
          at Milton standing over him.FUCKING DRIVERYou...you took my leg you fuck!
          Milton presses the shotgun barrel into the man's good knee.FUCKING DRIVERWait. Wait!MILTONWhere is she?FUCKING DRIVERI...I don't...
          Suddenly Fucking Passenger, flattened by the tire iron, sits
          up, dazed. Sees Milton. Spots the iron. Goes for it.
          Milton spins and KAFOOM!
          Blows Fucking Passenger to hell.FUCKING DRIVERStillwater! Stillwater Marsh! I
          don't know where exactly. They
          call it Wolf Deer Run, that's all I
          know. I swear!4.Milton digs Driver's cell phone out...stares at it for a
          moment, drops it, finds wallet, takes cash.FUCKING DRIVERBut you're too late. You gotta
          know that. Next full moon she's
          dead. Nothing you can do. She's
          dead and hell will walk the earth--WHAM!Milton shoves the barrel of his shotgun into the man's mouth,
          breaking a couple teeth in the process.
          Milton hisses, his throat dry, like a man who hasn't quenched
          his thirst in a decade.MILTONYou tell him I'm coming. You got
          that? I'm coming to get her back.
          You tell him. Tell him I'm gonna
          kill every last one of you fuckers.
          Milton turns on his heels. Walks into the dust and doesn't
          look back.EXT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAYBlack smoke billows from the BBQ of this shithole diner.
          It's the only building as far as the eye can see. The lot
          dotted with vehicles past their prime. A muscle bound ‘67
          GTO stands out.INT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAYCovered in a thick layer of cooking grease, this is one of
          those diners where white trash goes to die. Half a dozen
          PATRONS sit at bar and booth as a young American Indian
          couple, MARY and DALE, enter with their children 2, 4 and 7.
          Two waitresses, PIPER (25) and NORMAJEAN (57) stand at the
          kitchen pick-up window. Through which we can see the
          joint's owner, FAT LOU, dripping sweat into a pile of
          scrambled eggs. Fat Lou is fat. Holy fuck fat.PIPERSo I tell him, I says, “Frank,
          that's it. No more free milk. You
          gonna have to buy the cow you son
          of a bitch.”5.NORMAJEANBut you're not fat, PiperPIPERWha? No, NormaJean, “buy the cow.”
          Marry me? He's got to marry me.
          I'm sayin I cut him off.NORMAJEANYou cut him off?PIPERNot just yes but hell yes! No
          tits, no ass. And I told him if I
          see that big ol' dick of his
          anywhere near my face I'm gonna
          bite it in half.
          Normajean giggles with embarrassment.NORMAJEANYou said that? How long's it been?
          Piper frowns.PIPERWell, it's only been two days but
          that's like a decade in horny
          fucker years.NORMAJEANSo he bought you a diamond?PIPERA diamond? God no. If Frank had
          money for a diamond I would have
          jacked his sorry ass ages ago and
          put this shithole life in the rear
          view. But he did get down on his
          knees and ask me to be his bride.NORMAJEANNo way.PIPERYes way!
          NormaJean grabs Piper in a great big hug.NORMAJEANOh! Piper!6.PIPERI KNOW!FF-FF-FFUMP!Something yellow peppers them both. The girls look up as --
          Fat Lou SLAMS two plates of food into the window.PIPERDid...did you just throw scrambled
          eggs at us?FAT LOUI don't pay you bitches to stand
          around. Now get the fuck back to work!
          Piper snatches one of the plates.
          She delivers it to a Patron sitting at the bar, then turns
          toward the newly arrived customers.
          The American Indian couple scans a menu...
          ...and Milton (the old guy from our opening) scans her...he
          quickly looks down at an unfolded map of Colorado as --
          NormaJean steps up to Milton.NORMAJEANHello beautiful, coffee?MILTONThat'd be great. Tell me,
          Stillwater Marsh around here?NORMAJEAN(shrugs) Stillwater...doesn't ring
          a bell. I'll get that coffee.
          But Milton makes eye contact with Mary, the Indian mother.
          She quickly looks away. She knows something...
          Milton opens his mouth to speak as--
          --Piper approaches the American Indian couple.PIPERHi guys, I'm Piper. Can I bring
          you something to drink?MOTHER MARYWe'll take this.7.Mary points to the menu, Piper leans in, reads.PIPER“She's a Brickhouse” breakfast.
          Ten monster flapjacks for 4.99.MOTHER MARYAnd five waters.PIPERFive waters. And what can I get for...
          Father averts his eyes. He's embarrassed.MOTHER MARYThat's it. Just the pancakes. If
          that's okay?
          Piper stares at them as if for the first time. Shit...
          they're hungry. And broke.PIPEROh. Of course. Coming right up.
          Piper shoots Milton a look as she crosses to the kitchen.
          Milton rises slightly. He's clearly trying to get Mary's
          attention. She's ignoring him.
          Piper calls through the window to Fat Lou.PIPEROne brickhouse.
          She turns and stops suddenly. Stares at a pile of muffins
          kept fresh within a glass cake stand.ANOTHER ANGLEMary can no longer avoid Milton's stare.MILTONStillwater Marsh? You know it?
          Dale, the father, keeps his back to Milton as he speaks.DALENo. We don't.MILTONIt's important.8.MOTHER MARYYou're in the wrong state.DALEMary!MILTONAnd what state Should I be in?
          Dale turns, glares at Milton.DALENevada. Catch the 50 and cut across.
          It's a two day drive from here.MILTONAnd Wolf Deer Run?DALENever heard of it.
          The 7 year old LITTLE GIRL'S eyes brighten.LITTLE GIRLYes you have daddy. Wolf Deer Run,
          that's where The Smiling Man takes
          the wicked children to see the
          Mother of all things.
          Mary SHUSHES her Little Girl and pulls her close.MILTONMother of all things, that sounds
          very interesting.LITTLE GIRLOh it is! The Mother of all things
          bleeds black tears unto those whoCUT HER--Mother places her hand over her daughter's mouth.MOTHER MARYIt's nothing. Just a story parents
          tell to their children. Like the
          boogey-man or the tooth-fairy.
          A plate filled with muffins thumps down before them. Piper
          leans in with three kiddie cups.PIPERAnd three milks.9.MOTHER MARYBut we didn't order--PIPER(whispers) --On the house.
          She winks and moves away...eyeing the kitchen window. She
          doesn't notice...MILTONstaring at her again. An impressed smirk on his face.
          Suddenly NormaJean steps in front of him.NORMAJEANSo, aren't you gonna ask what time
          my shift ends? Full moon tonight.
          I'm always a little ‘randy' during
          full moon.MILTONFull moon's three days off.NORMAJEAN(she touches his hand)
          You sure ‘bout that, sweetie?MILTONPretty sure. (looks outside) Hell
          of a ride out there. Yours?NORMAJEANThe GTO? I wish.MILTON(glances at Piper)
          Hers?NORMAJEANSure but if you're lookin' for a
          ride...MILTONAnd would you be gentle?NORMAJEANLife's too short for that, sweetie.INT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - KITCHEN - DAYPiper enters with two dirty plates, scrapes them and drops
          them into a soapy sink. She turns right into --10.FAT LOUHe glares down at her.PIPERJesus Lou, back the fuck off.FAT LOU“On the house”? On the fucking
          house?PIPEROh relax. We gotta toss them
          muffins out today anyway.
          She sidesteps him, exits the kitchen.INT. HIGHWAY 50 - FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAYAs Piper crosses toward the bar, Lou grabs her from behind,
          spins her around.PIPERGet your hand off of me!
          His fat fingers tighten around her shoulder.FAT LOUYou get over there and you charge
          them for those muff...
          Piper strikes. Like a snake. Her hand reaches beneath the
          fat of his belly and vice grips his balls. Hell, we even
          hear the CRUNCH.
          Fat Lou GASPS and doubles over allowing Piper to SLAM her
          forehead into the bridge of his nose!KER-RACK!PIPERI told you, you fat fuck son of a
          bitch, never to touch me again!
          His nose seeps blood.FAT LOULet...go...of...my...
          She SLAPS him across the face with her free hand.11.PIPERShut up.
          She takes a step backwards, but keeps her hand clamped to his
          nuts. He has no choice but follow.
          She pulls him up to the American Indian family.PIPERTell'em.FAT LOUWha...what?
          We see it in her face. She squeezes. Lou's eyes go
          wide...flutter...he's about to pass out.PIPERTell them...the muffins...are on
          the house.FAT LOUOn. The. House.
          She lets go. Lou drops to his knees, then timbers to the
          floor as Piper turns to the family.
          The children are huddled, terrified against their parents.PIPERI'm sorry your kids had to see
          that. Put some honey butter on
          those bran muffins and they taste
          an awful lot better.
          Piper turns and crosses toward the door.
          NormaJean is pale as she watches her go.
          Piper brushes past Milton's booth. His cup is there but
          Milton is gone.EXT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAYWe're close on a car door as it SLAMS.
          CLOSE ON GLASS PACK EXHAUST PIPES as the car RUMBLES with
          life. An “I brake for pussy” bumper sticker stands out.
          THE BACK GLASS vibrates as MUSIC blares from within.12.INT. GTO - DAYPiper's French manicured hand wraps the floor-mounted gear
          shift like a cock and SLAMS it into drive.EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DAYWith Piper behind the wheel the GTO tears onto the highway...
          ...and blows passed Milton, as he walks west, duffle bag
          thrown over his shoulder.INT. GTO - DAYPiper SINGS. She's empowered. Then...KA-THUNK.She grips the wheel.
          The RPMS drop.EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DAYThe GTO pulls off the road...white smoke HISSES from beneath
          the hood.
          CLOSE ON ENGINE as the hood POPS.
          Piper waves a hand in front of her face as the smoke devours
          her. She COUGHS. Stares. It's clear she don't know jack
          shit about engines.
          FOOTSTEPS. Piper slips the keys between her fingers. Ready.
          Milton appears through the smoke.MILTONCar trouble?
          Piper stares. It's the way he said it. Too knowing.
          Milton glances at the engine.MILTONOh, that's not so bad. I can fix
          that for you if you like.13.PIPERI would. Thank you.MILTONIf you give me a lift.PIPERI'm only going as far as Blackfoot
          Falls. The truckstop there.MILTONAnd I'd be much obliged.
          Milton leans in, flicks something then rises and THUMPS the
          hood shut with a smile.MILTONShall we?INT. GTO - DAYPiper behind the wheel focuses on the road. Milton sits in
          the passenger seat, hugs his duffle bag, glances at Piper.
          Suddenly Piper turns on him.PIPERGet it straight old man. I ain't
          sleeping with you.
          Milton chuckles.MILTONDarlin, my days of bedding a gal ten
          minutes after I meet her are over.PIPERYeah. Well, that's good to hear.MILTON(TO HIMSELF)For now, anyway.EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - LAURA'S TRUCK STOP MOTEL - DAYSeveral big rigs are parked near the truck stop. A few
          derelict vehicles outside the adjacent run down old motel.
          Piper's GTO pulls in and parks near the road.14.Piper climbs out. Milton rises stiffly and crosses toward
          her as he tosses the duffle over his shoulder. He offers his
          hand, gives her a smile.MILTON‘Preciate the ride, ma'am.
          Milton crosses toward an old Superman style phone booth.EXT. LAURA'S MOTEL - DAYPiper inserts her key, glances back at Milton.
          He's in the booth now, his back to her.
          Piper turns the key and opens the door.INT. LAURA'S MOTEL - ROOM 9 - DAYFirst thing we see is MONA'S naked ass and back. Long red
          hair, she is riding a naked FRANK. Neither realizes Piper
          has opened the door.MONAOh Frank, you know how long I've
          wanted to feel you inside me?FRANKFaster.MONAOh, you want it faster?
          Mona thrusts her pelvic the tiniest bit faster.
          Suddenly Piper's hand clinches a handful of red hair and
          yanks! Mona SCREAMS in pain, Frank YELPS in fear as Piper
          drags Mona backwards off the bed.EXT. LAURA'S MOTEL - DAYPiper drags Mona, KICKING and SCREAMING, into the lot, then
          drops her and whirls toward the room--
          -- where Frank struggles, desperate to find his pants.MONAWhat's the matter with you?! You
          psycho bitch from...15.Piper spins on Mona, points a finger in warning.PIPERDon't.
          It shuts Mona up.
          Piper storms back toward the room.HER POVFrank hops with one leg in his jeans. He sees her coming.
          Although he's a big fella, he looks scared.
          Suddenly Mona steps in front of Piper and SLAPS her across
          the face!MONAFuck you, Piper, we're in lo--WHAM!Piper clocks Mona!
          Mona stands there...dazed. Swaying. Confused.PIPERWhat was that? I didn't catch that
          last word.MONAOh...I...I said...we're in lo--WHAM!This time Mona stumbles backwards and CRASHES into a metal
          chair on the motel porch.

          near me.16.FRANKLook, sooner you accept this is
          your fault, the better.
          Piper stops, turns, stares.FRANKBaby, I can't just turn it off.
          Now you know that. I gotta have
          it. At least once a day. It's in
          the wiring. You did this. You
          made me cheat on you. You're lucky
          I'm not more pissed about it.
          Piper stares for a moment. It's like she's been sucker
          punched. Then she zips her bag and crosses to the door.FRANKPiper! Now cut it out. Enough
          with the drama!INT. HIGHWAY 70 - LAURA'S MOTEL - PHONE BOOTH - DAYMilton watches Piper's room. It's clear the phone to his ear
          is a fake out.
          Suddenly a look crosses his face. He jerks around.HIS POVTHE GAS STATION ACROSS HIGHWAY 70...the garage. A grimy looking GREASE MONKEY is staring at
          Milton, cell phone to his ear. He sees Milton see him,
          quickly backs into the shadows.FRANK (O.S.)Piper!EXT. LAURA'S TRUCK STOP MOTEL - DAYPiper exits, glances at Mona, sprawled out unconscious in the
          metal chair, an ASIAN MAN in a Hawaiian shirt SNAPS pictures
          of her.
          Piper snatches the camera and flings it against the wall
          where it SHATTERS.ASIAN MANHey?!17.PIPERPervert.
          Piper stomps across the lot as Frank exits, calls to her.FRANKBaby, Please. Now hold on. Can we
          talk about this?
          Piper keeps walking. Never looks back.FRANKPiper, stop this! You got nowhere
          to go and you know it.PIPERI'll go to San Francisco and stay
          with my cousin.FRANK(Realization) Whoa. You ain't
          taking my car.
          Piper pulls out the keys, twirls them on her finger.FRANKI said, you ain't taking my car, bitch.
          Frank grabs her by the shoulder. Piper spins and --WHAM!-- punches him in the face. Caught off guard, Frank
          stumbles, nearly goes down.PIPERYour car?! Who's been making the
          payments you out of work, skanky
          Mona fucking piece of shit?!
          She drops the gym bag and launches into him. A blur of FISTS
          and CLAWS. The tears flow. Heartbreak, anger, humiliation.
          Frank stumble backwards. Tries to block the blows. WHAM!FRANKStop...WHAM!FRANK...hitting me!18.She swings but this time Frank lashes out.KUH-RACK!He punches her in the face. Hard. She drops to her hands

          what you made me do!
          She staggers to her feet, sways before him.FRANKCome on, I'll get you some ice--
          She SPITS blood in his face and SWINGS!
          He blocks the blow and BACKHANDS her with the force of
          thunder. She spins and SLAMS into the ground. Doubtful
          she'll get up this time, then --QUIET LAUGHTERFrank stares as Piper rolls over.PIPERFrank. Sweetie. I'm gonna tell
          everybody what I caught you doing
          with my pink dildo.
          Her laughter becomes a hysterical fit.FRANKThat's it.
          He drops on top of her, his fingers curl into a fist.FRANKYou don't wanna fuck me? Fine.
          When I'm done nobody's gonna wanna
          fuck you. Ever.PIPERGo to hell.

          Milton GUNS the engine - SMASHES two followers head on. They
          fly up the hood, SMASH the glass - but shield him from
          another frontal assault. Their bodies RIDDLED with lead.
          The Cultists circle him to get a better shot.
          A Magnum is thrust into the driver's side window - right in
          Milton's face.
          He leans back just as the gun is FIRED. Milton yanks the
          wheel, reverses the Nova - wrenches the Magnum from the
          fucker's hand. The Cultist hangs on. Claws at Milton.
          Milton twirls the Magnum, gunslinger style. Jams the barrel
          into the Cultist's face and FIRES.

          Piper considers, the SOUNDS of battle rising from below.ACCOUNTANTPiper, he didn't steal that gun to
          kill me. He stole it to slow me down.
          He's getting what he wanted. Now, go

          Nova SCREECHES to a halt, tires SPIN, smoke spews, gas drips
          from the wreck.
          Jonah and the half a dozen remaining Cultists zero in around
          the Nova, guns trained on the driver's door.

          At Jonah's feet, Milton scrambles forward and we realize he
          wasn't crawling toward his grand-baby.
