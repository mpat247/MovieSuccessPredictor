               (MR DASHWOOD, 52) lies his skin waxy, his breathing laboured. 
               Around him two silhouettes move and murmur, their clothing

                         all, but make sure she finds a good

                         hereabouts, little wonder none has 
                         pleased her.

               They smile at each other. MRS DASHWOOD is just managing to

               MRS DASHWOOD tries to laugh but it emerges as a sob. An older 
               MANSERVANT (THOMAS) now enters, anxiety written on every 
               feature.THOMASYour son is arrived from London, 
                         sir.

               MR DASHWOOD squeezes his wife's hand.MR DASHWOODLet me speak to John alone.

               She nods quickly and he smiles at her with infinite 
               tenderness.MR DASHWOODAh, my dear. How happy you have made 
                         me.

               MRS DASHWOOD makes a superhuman effort and smiles back. She 
               allows THOMAS to help her out. She passes JOHN DASHWOOD as 
               he enters, presses his hand, but cannot speak. JOHN takes 
               her place by the bed.JOHNFather...

               MR DASHWOOD summons his last ounces of energy and starts to 
               whisper with desperate intensity.MR DASHWOODJohn you will find out soon enough 
                         from my will that the estate of 
                         Norland was left to me in such a way 
                         as prevents me from dividing it 
                         between my families.

               JOHN blinks. He cannot quite take it in.JOHNCalm yourself, Father. This is not 
                         good for you.

               But MR DASHWOOD continues with even greater determination.MR DASHWOODNorland in its entirety is therefore 
                         yours by law and I am happy for you 
                         and Fanny.

               JOHN looks torn between genuine distress and unexpected 
               delight.MR DASHWOODBut your stepmother my wife and 
                         daughters are left with only five 
                         hundred pounds a year, barely enough 
                         to live on and nothing for the girls' 
                         dowries. You must help them.

               JOHN's face is a picture of conflicting emotions. Behind 
               them is the ominous rustling of parchments.JOHNOf courseMR DASHWOODYou must promise to do this.

               A brief moment of sincerity overcomes JOHN's natural 
               hypocrisy.JOHNI promise, Father, I promise.

               MR DASHWOOD seems relieved. Suddenly his breathing changes.

               FANNY goes very still. JOHN gets nervous.JOHNThe interest will provide them with 
                         a little extra income. Such a gift

               looks furious.

               MRS DASHWOOD smiles warmly at EDWARD.

               CLOSE on ELINOR. She is impressed.INT. NORLAND PARK - STAIRCASE - DAYFANNY is walking with EDWARD, who looks at the pictures with 
               interest.FANNYThey are all exceedingly spoilt, I 
                         find. Miss Margaret spends all her 
                         time up trees and under furniture 
                         and I have barely had a civil word 
                         from Marianne.EDWARDMy dear Fanny, they have just lost 
                         their father their lives will never

               As they speak, EDWARD notices a large atlas retreating 
               apparently all by itself across the floor. Someone is 
               obviously under the table, pulling it out of sight. He 
               registers it and immediately moves in such a way as to shield 
               it from FANNY. He turns back, searching for something to 
               divert her.EDWARDI hear you have great plans for the 
                         walnut grove.FANNYOh yes! I shall have it pulled down 
                         to make room for a Grecian temple.

               There is a stifled wail from under the table, which EDWARD 
               covers with a cough.EDWARDHow picturesque. Will you show me 
                         the site?

               And he ushers FANNY out, flicking a quick glance over his 
               shoulder at the fugitive's foot.INT. NORLAND PARK - VELVET ROOM - DAYELINOR, MRS DASHWOOD and MARIANNE are sitting round a table 
               with a pile of letters. ELINOR is handing one back to her 
               mother.ELINORToo expensive. We do not need four 
                         bedrooms, we can share.MARIANNEThis one, then?

               ELINOR reads the letter quickly.ELINORMarianne, we have only five hundred 
                         pounds a year. I will send out more 
                         inquiries today.

               There is a knock on the door. Hesitantly, EDWARD appears.EDWARDPardon my intrusion, but I believe I 
                         have found what you are looking for.

               MARIANNE and MRS DASHWOOD are puzzled by his elliptical manner 
               but ELINOR immediately understands and rises, in smiling 
               relief.INT. NORLAND PARK - ENTRANCE HALL OUTSIDE LIBRARY - DAYEDWARD is standing outside keeping a discreet lookout. The 
               door is half open and he can hear ELINOR trying to coax 
               MARGARET out. FANNY walks by with a BUTLER to whom she is 
               giving instructions. EDWARD pretends to examine the mouldings 
               and she passes on unsuspecting.ELINOR (V.O.)Won't you come out, dearest? We 
                         haven't seen you all day. Mamma is 
                         very concerned.

               More silence. EDWARD thinks hard. He makes a decision.INT. NORLAND PARK - LIBRARY - DAYEDWARD walks in loudly.EDWARDOh, Miss Dashwood! Excuse me I was 
                         wondering do you by any chance have 
                         such a thing as a reliable atlas?

               ELINOR looks up at him in astonishment.ELINORI believe so.EDWARDExcellent. I wish to check the 
                         position of the Nile.

               EDWARD appears to be utterly sincere.EDWARDMy sister says it is in South America.

               From under the table we hear a snort. ELINOR looks at him in 
               realisation.ELINOROh! No, no indeed. She is quite wrong. 
                         For I believe it is in--in Belgium.EDWARDBelgium? Surely not. You must be 
                         thinking of the Volga.MARGARET(from under the table)
                         The Volga?ELINOROf course. The Volga, which, as you 
                         know, starts in...EDWARDVladivostok, and ends in...ELINORSt Albans.EDWARDIndeed. Where the coffee beans come 
                         from.

               They are having such a good time that it is rather a pity 
               the game is stopped by the appearance from under the table 
               of MARGARET who reveals herself to be a disheveled girl of 
               eleven. She hauls the atlas up and plonks it in front ofEDWARD.MARGARETThe source of the Nile is in

               EDWARD shakes MARGARET's hand solemnly and looks over her 
               head at ELINOR. They smile at each other, a connection made.INT. NORLAND PARK - DRAWING ROOM - ANOTHER DAYJOHN is reading a newspaper. MRS DASHWOOD sits across from 
               FANNY, who thumbs through a fashion-plate magazine. ELINOR 
               is at a desk by the window writing a letter we see the words 
               'of course we should like to leave as soon as possible'. 
               Suddenly she hears a commotion outside. MARGARET runs past 
               the window brandishing a stick. EDWARD follows, and proceeds 
               to teach her the first principles of sword-fighting. They 
               feint and parry, EDWARD serious and without a hint of 
               condescension, MARGARET concentrating furiously. EDWARD 
               suddenly turns, as though feeling ELINOR's gaze. She smiles 
               but looks away quickly.INT. NORLAND PARK - VELVET ROOM - ANOTHER DAYEDWARD comes into the doorway and sees ELINOR who is listening 
               to MARIANNE playing a concerto. ELINOR stands in a graceful, 
               rather sad attitude, her back to us. Suddenly she senses 
               EDWARD behind her and turns. He is about to turn away, 
               embarrassed to have been caught admiring her, when he sees 
               she has been weeping. Hastily she tries to dry her eyes. He 
               comes forward and offers her a handkerchief, which she takes 
               with a grateful smile. We notice his monogram in the corner:ECF.ELINOR(apologetic)
                         That was my father's favourite.

               EDWARD nods kindly.ELINORThank you so much for your help with 
                         Margaret, Mr Ferrars. She is a changed 
                         girl since your arrival.EDWARDNot at all. I enjoy her company.ELINORHas she shown you her tree-house?EDWARDNot yet. Would you do me the honour, 
                         Miss Dashwood? It is very fine out.ELINORWith pleasure.

               They start to walk out of shot, still talking.ELINORMargaret has always wanted to travel.EDWARDI know. She is heading an expedition 
                         to China shortly. I am to go as her 
                         servant but only on the understanding

               CAM tilts up to find MRS DASHWOOD on the middle landing of 
               the staircase, smiling down at them. CAM tilts up yet further 
               to find FANNY on the landing above, watching EDWARD and ELINOR 
               with a face like a prune.EXT. NORLAND PARK - GARDENS - DAYEDWARD and ELINOR are still talking as they walk arm in arm 
               in the late afternoon sun.EDWARDAll I want--all I have ever wanted 
                         is the quiet of a private life but 
                         my mother is determined to see me 
                         distinguished.ELINORAs?EDWARDShe hardly knows. Any fine figure 
                         will suit a great orator, a leading 
                         politician, even a barrister would 
                         serve, but only on the condition 
                         that I drive my own barouche and 
                         dine in the first circles.

               His tone is light but there is an underlying bitterness to 
               it.ELINORAnd what do you wish for?EDWARDI always preferred the church, but 
                         that is not smart enough for my mother 
                         she prefers the army, but that is a 
                         great deal too smart for me.ELINORWould you stay in London?EDWARDI hate London. No peace. A country 
                         living is my ideal a small parish 
                         where I might do some good, keep

               intimate, the quality of the conversation rooted now in their 
               affections.ELINORYou talk of feeling idle and useless 
                         imagine how that is compounded when

                         whatsoever of any occupation.

               Rather mortified, EDWARD starts again, but not before

               comfort him a little.INT. NORLAND PARK - MORNING ROOM - DAYMRS DASHWOOD is ruminating sadly. MARIANNE rushes in holding

                         Elinor have formed an attachment.

               Marianne nods, a little reluctantly.MRS DASHWOODIt would be cruel to take her away 
                         so soon and Devonshire is so far.

               MRS DASHWOOD makes her decision. She takes the letter and 
               hides it in the pocket of her gown. MARIANNE looks on 
               frowningly.MRS DASHWOODWhy so grave? Do you disapprove her 
                         choice?MARIANNEBy no means. Edward is very amiable.MRS DASHWOODAmiable but?MARIANNEBut there is something wanting. He

                         To love is to burn to be on fire, 
                         all made of passion, of adoration, 
                         of sacrifice! Like Juliet, or

               MARIANNE pulls away, her eyes full of tears.MARIANNEI am sure you will be very happy.

               ELINOR trails off. MARIANNE looks at her keenly.MARIANNEDo you love him?

               The bold clarity of this question discomforts ELINOR.ELINORI do not attempt to deny that I think

                         them to marry for love, first and 
                         foremost? I have always felt that, 
                         contrary to common wisdom, true 
                         affection is by far the most valuable

               FANNY lowers her voice confidingly.FANNYYou see, my dear Mrs Dashwood, Edward 
                         is entirely the kind of compassionate 
                         person upon whom penniless women can 
                         prey--and having entered into any 
                         kind of understanding, he would never 
                         go back on his word. He is quite 
                         simply incapable of doing so. But it 
                         would lead to his ruin. I worry for 
                         him so, Mrs Dashwood. My mother has 
                         always made it perfectly plain that 
                         she will withdraw all financial 
                         support from Edward, should he choose 
                         to plant his affections in less... 
                         exalted ground than he deserves.

               It is impossible for MRS DASHWOOD not to get the point. She

                         discovered their amour, she was flung 
                         out of the house and he packed off 
                         into the army. I believe he would

               Now they are getting somewhere. MARIANNE is about to ask 
               another question when they hear a horse galloping up. Everyone 
               is electrified. MARGARET runs to the window and turns back 
               in disappointment.MARGARETIt is Colonel Brandon. I shall go 
                         outside and keep watch.

               MARGARET runs out of the room.SIR JOHNYou are all on the lookout for

               He hands MARIANNE the flowers with a smile.MARIANNEThank you so much, Colonel.

               She rather absently hands the flowers to ELINOR, who goes 
               for a vase. SIR JOHN gestures at BRANDON with bluff 
               insensitivity.SIR JOHNMiss Marianne, I cannot see why you 
                         should set your cap at Mr Willoughby

               BRANDON's light tone betrays no emotion. ELINOR comes back 
               in with the flowers and puts them on the table next toMARIANNE.SIR JOHNAye, he visits every year for he is 
                         to inherit Allenham--and he has a

               Suddenly MARGARET runs in screaming 'Marianne's preserver!' 
               at the top of her voice. Everyone starts to move at once. 
               MARGARET is silenced. BRANDON looks at MARIANNE, whose 
               incandescent expression makes her feelings all too clear.SIR JOHNHere is the man himself. Come, Brandon--
                         we know when we are not wanted. Let

                         crawling with my spies.

               He suddenly produces a bunch of wild flowers from behind his 
               back and offers them to MARIANNE with a courtly, humorous 
               bow.WILLOUGHBYAnd since you cannot venture out to

                         offering, nor the most elegant. I am

                         beyond expression--WILLOUGHBYBut it is I who am grateful. I have 
                         often passed this cottage and grieved 
                         for its lonely state--and then the

                         when I arrived was that it was taken. 
                         I felt a peculiar interest in the 
                         event which nothing can account for 
                         but my present delight in meeting 
                         you.

               He is merry, spirited, voluble--a breath of fresh air. ELINOR 
               brings back WILLOUGHBY's flowers and places them next to 
               BRANDON's on the side table.MRS DASHWOODPray sit down, Mr Willoughby.

               She indicates a chair but WILLOUGHBY sees a book lying on 
               MARIANNE's footstool, picks it up and--to her great delight--
               sits down on the stool at her feet.WILLOUGHBYWho is reading Shakespeare's sonnets?

               WILLOUGHBY joins in the line halfway through and continues. 
               ELINOR and MRS DASHWOOD exchange glances. Clearly, their 
               contribution to this conversation will be minimal.WILLOUGHBY'That looks on storms'--or is it 
                         tempests? Let me find it.

               WILLOUGHBY gets out a tiny leatherbound book.WILLOUGHBYIt is strange you should be reading

                         me always.

               It is a miniature copy of the sonnets. MARIANNE is delighted, 
               and, mutually astonished at this piece of synchronicity, 
               they proceed to look up other favourites, chatting as though 
               they were already intimates.

               MRS DASHWOOD smiles at ELINOR with satisfaction. ELINOR, 
               amused, picks up her sewing. MARGARET stares. WILLOUGHBY and

                         intimacy. Seven years would be 
                         insufficient to make some people 
                         acquainted with each other and seven

               stare after them and comment to each other.EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN PATH - DAYMARIANNE and ELINOR are coming down the path together. 
               MARIANNE is dressed to go out. The argument has evidently 
               started indoors and is being continued here.MARIANNEIf there was any true impropriety in 
                         my behaviour, I should be sensible 
                         of it, Elinor--ELINORBut as it has already exposed you to 
                         some very impertinent remarks, do 
                         you not begin to doubt your own 
                         discretion?MARIANNEIf the impertinent remarks of such 
                         as Mrs Jennings are proof of 
                         impropriety, then we are all offending 
                         every moment of our lives--

               The conversation is halted by the arrival of COLONEL BRANDON 
               on horseback.COLONEL BRANDON(dismounting)
                         Miss Dashwood! Miss Marianne!ELINORGood morning, Colonel!COLONEL BRANDONI come to issue an invitation. A 
                         picnic on my estate at Delaford--if 
                         you would care to join us on Thursday 
                         next. Mrs Jennings's daughter and 
                         her husband are traveling up 
                         especially.ELINORThank you, Colonel, we shall be 
                         delighted.

               At that moment, WILLOUGHBY's curricle hoves into view and 
               MARIANNE's face lights up.COLONEL BRANDON(to Marianne)
                         I will of course be including Mr 
                         Willoughby in the party.

               Even MARIANNE is a little embarrassed and recollects her 
               manners. She smiles kindly at BRANDON.MARIANNEI should be delighted to join you, 
                         Colonel!

               The COLONEL helps her into the curricle, exchanging nods 
               with WILLOUGHBY, who is regarding him with some suspicion.WILLOUGHBYGood morning, Miss Dashwood; good 
                         morning, Colonel.MARIANNEThe Colonel has invited us to 
                         Delaford, Willoughby!WILLOUGHBYExcellent. I understand you have a 
                         particularly fine pianoforte, Colonel.

               The undercurrents of this conversation are decidedly tense.COLONEL BRANDONA Broadwood Grand.MARIANNEA Broadwood Grand! Then I shall really 
                         be able to play for you!WILLOUGHBYWe shall look forward to it!

               MARIANNE smiles her perfect happiness at him and he whips up 
               the horses. They drive off, waving their farewells.

               BRANDON looks after them for a silent moment, and then 
               collects himself and turns to ELINOR, who is less than 
               satisfied with their behaviour.COLONEL BRANDONYour sister seems very happy.ELINORYes. Marianne does not approve of 
                         hiding her emotions. In fact, her 
                         romantic prejudices have the 
                         unfortunate tendency to set propriety 
                         at naught.COLONEL BRANDONShe is wholly unspoilt.ELINORRather too unspoilt, in my view. The 
                         sooner she becomes acquainted with 
                         the ways of the world, the better.

               COLONEL BRANDON looks at her sharply and then speaks very 
               deliberately, as though controlling some powerful emotion.COLONEL BRANDONI knew a lady like your sister--the 
                         same impulsive sweetness of temper--
                         who was forced into, as you put it, 
                         a better acquaintance with the world. 
                         The result was only ruination and 
                         despair.

               He stops, and briskly remounts his horse.COLONEL BRANDONDo not desire it, Miss Dashwood.EXT. BARTON PARK - DRIVE - DAYPeople and carriages fill the drive, the sun shines and the 
               atmosphere is pleasantly expectant. SIR JOHN is organising 
               the provision of blankets and parasols and COLONEL BRANDON 
               is busy furnishing the DRIVERS with their routes. There are 
               three new faces a pretty, blowsy WOMAN (CHARLOTTE PALMER), a 
               stony-faced MAN (MR PALMER) and an exceedingly good-looking 
               GIRL (LUCY STEELE), who are standing with ELINOR, MARIANNE, 
               MARGARET, MRS JENNINGS and MRS DASHWOOD.

               MARIANNE is standing slightly apart, looking out along the 
               road, impatient for WILLOUGHBY.MRS JENNINGSImagine my surprise, Mrs Dashwood, 
                         when Charlotte and her lord and master 
                         appeared with our cousin Lucy! The 
                         last person I expected to see! 'Where 
                         did you pop out from, Miss?' says I. 
                         I was never so surprised to see anyone 
                         in all my life!

               LUCY STEELE smiles shyly and looks at the ground. MRS JENNINGS 
               continues sotto voce to MRS DASHWOOD.MRS JENNINGSShe probably came on purpose to share 
                         the fun, for there are no funds for 
                         such luxuries at home, poor thing.LUCYI had not seen you for so long, dear 
                         Mrs Jennings, I could not resist the 
                         opportunity.CHARLOTTEOh, you sly thing! It was the Misses 
                         Dashwood she wanted to see, not 
                         Delaford, Mamma! I have heard nothing 
                         but 'Miss Dashwood this, Miss Dashwood 
                         that' for I don't know how long! And 
                         what do you think of them now you do 
                         see them, Lucy? My mother has talked 
                         of nothing else in her letters since 
                         you came to Barton, Mrs Dashwood. Mr 
                         Palmer--are they not the very 
                         creatures she describes?

               MR PALMER regards his wife with a less than enchanted 
               expression.MR PALMERNothing like.CHARLOTTE(laughing gaily)
                         Why, Mr Palmer! Do you know you are 
                         quite rude today? He is to be an MP, 
                         you know, Mrs Dashwood, and it is 
                         very fatiguing for him for he is 
                         forced to make everybody like him--
                         he says it is quite shocking--MRS PALMERI never said anything so irrational. 
                         Don't palm all your abuses of the 
                         language upon me.MRS JENNINGS(to Mrs Dashwood)
                         Mr Palmer is so droll--he is always 
                         out of humour.

               MR PALMER does indeed have the air of a man under siege. 
               WILLOUGH BY suddenly appears in his curricle. MARIANNE waves 
               to him with a radiant smile. MRS JENNINGS nudges CHARLOTTE 
               and points to MARIANNE.MRS JENNINGSHere he is! Now you shall see, 
                         Charlotte.

               WILLOUGHBY drives up as close to MARIANNE as possible, making 
               her laugh.MRS JENNINGSHow now, Mr Willoughby! You must 
                         greet my daughter Charlotte, and Mr 
                         Palmer--WILLOUGHBYHow do you do?MRS JENNINGSAnd my little cousin, Miss Lucy 
                         Steele.WILLOUGHBYWelcome to our party, Miss Steele!

               LUCY bobs demurely. WILLOUGHBY inclines his head politely, 
               leaps from the curricle and hands MARIANNE in. MRS JENNINGS 
               coos and chuckles at them. CHARLOTTE nudges ELINOR.CHARLOTTEI know Mr Willoughby extremely well--
                         not that I ever spoke to him but I 
                         have seen him forever in town. Your 
                         sister is monstrous lucky to get 
                         him. Mamma says Colonel Brandon is 
                         in love with her as well, which is a 
                         very great compliment for he hardly 
                         ever falls in love with anyone.

               ELINOR smiles politely. WILLOUGHBY moves the curricle out to 
               the front of the drive. CHARLOTTE points after them and laughs 
               with MRS JENNINGS. LUCY edges up beside ELINOR.LUCYMay I beg a seat beside you, Miss 
                         Dashwood? I have so longed to make 
                         your better acquaintance! I have 
                         heard nothing but the highest praise 
                         for you.

               ELINOR is relieved to change the subject.ELINORI would be delighted. But Sir John 
                         and Mrs Jennings are too excessive 
                         in their compliments. I am sure to 
                         disappoint.LUCYNo, for it was from quite another 
                         source that I heard you praised and 
                         one not at all inclined to 
                         exaggeration.

               LUCY speaks in a knowing, confidential undertone, as though 
               not wanting anyone else to hear. At that moment a HORSEMAN 
               thunders up the drive towards them. Everyone turns to face 
               the new arrival.SIR JOHNWhat can this be?

               It is a MESSENGER who has obviously had a long, hard ride. 
               He asks for COLONEL BRANDON and hands him a letter, which 
               BRANDON tears open. MRS JENNINGS is puce with suppressed 
               curiosity.COLONEL BRANDONMy horse! Quickly!SIR JOHNWhat is the matter, Brandon?COLONEL BRANDONI must away to London.SIR JOHNNo! Impossible!

               Everyone gathers round BRANDON, who is, naturally, mortified. 
               A SERVANT brings up the COLONEL's horse.COLONEL BRANDONImperative.

               There is a murmur of disappointment from the party. SIR JOHN 
               is embarrassed and protests again.SIR JOHNBut Brandon, we are all assembled. 
                         We cannot picnic at Delaford without 
                         our host! Go up to town tomorrow.WILLOUGHBYOr wait till we return and start 
                         then--you would not be six hours 
                         later.COLONEL BRANDONI cannot afford to lose one minute.

               As he speaks, he is mounting his horse. His grave urgency 
               silences all protest and he gallops off, leaving everyone 
               stunned and, of course, deeply curious. Then they all start 
               to talk at once. LUCY is still next to ELINOR.LUCYOh, Miss Dashwood, I cannot bear it! 
                         Just when I was to have the 
                         opportunity of speaking with you.EXT. MEADOW NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAYHaving been denied their trip, the DASHWOODS and WILLOUGHBY 
               have set out an impromptu picnic. WILLOUGHBY is wandering 
               restlessly about.

               The weather is sublime.WILLOUGHBYFrailty, thy name is Brandon!MARIANNEThere are some people who cannot 
                         bear a party of pleasure. I think he 
                         wrote the letter himself as a trick 
                         for getting out of it.MRS DASHWOOD(indulgently)
                         You are a very wicked pair, Colonel 
                         Brandon will be sadly missed.WILLOUGHBYWhy? When he is the kind of man that 
                         everyone speaks well of and no one 
                         wants to talk to.MARIANNEExactly!ELINORNonsense.MRS DASHWOODColonel Brandon is very highly 
                         esteemed at the Park.WILLOUGHBYWhich is enough censure in itself.ELINOR(half laughing)
                         Really, Willoughby!WILLOUGHBY(imitating Mrs Jennings 
                              perfectly)
                         Come, come, Mr Impudence--I know you 
                         and your wicked ways--oh!

               He gives a little shriek and waddles about the garden doing 
               her walk. He comes up to ELINOR and puts his head on her 
               shoulder.WILLOUGHBYCome, Miss Dashwood, reveal your 
                         beau, reveal him, I say! Let's have 
                         no secrets between friends! Let me 
                         winkle them out of you!

               ELINOR hits him on the nose with her teaspoon and he waddles 
               off to MARIANNE.WILLOUGHBY(as Mrs Jennings)
                         I declare, Miss Marianne, if I do 
                         not have you married to the Colonel 
                         by teatime, I shall swallow my own 
                         bonnet.

               MARIANNE laughs. WILLOUGHBY drops the parody suddenly.WILLOUGHBYAs if you could marry such a 
                         character.ELINORWhy should you dislike him?

               There is indeed an edge to WILLOUGHBY's raillery. He flicks 
               ELINOR an almost alarmed glance and then sweeps MARIANNE to 
               her feet and starts to dance around the garden with her.WILLOUGHBYBecause he has threatened me with 
                         rain when I wanted it fine, he has 
                         found fault with the balance of my 
                         curricle and I cannot persuade him 
                         to buy my brown mare. If it will be 
                         of any satisfaction to you, however, 
                         to be told I believe his character 
                         to be in all other respects 
                         irreproachable, I am ready to confess 
                         it. And in return for an 
                         acknowledgement that must give me 
                         some pain.
                              (he is slowing down)
                         You cannot deny me the privilege...

                         as much as I adore...

               He and MARIANNE are standing looking at each other. The 
               expression on WILLOUGHBY's face is heart-stopping. MARGARET 
               has stopped eating and is staring with her mouth open.

               ELINOR glances at MRS DASHWOOD but she is gazing up at them 
               with almost as many stars in her eyes as MARIANNE.

               Suddenly WILLOUGHBY breaks the mood by swinging away from 
               MARIANNE and gesturing to the house.WILLOUGHBY--this cottage!

               The tension is broken. MARGARET starts to chew again.MRS DASHWOODI have great plans for improvements 
                         to it, you know, Mr Willoughby.WILLOUGHBYNow that I will never consent to. 
                         Not a stone must be added to its 
                         walls. Were I rich enough, I would 
                         instantly pull down Combe Magna and 
                         build it up again in the exact image 
                         of that cottage!ELINORWith dark, narrow stairs, a poky 
                         hall and a fire that smokes?WILLOUGHBYEspecially the fire that smokes! 
                         Then I might be as happy at Combe 
                         Magna as I have been at Barton.

               He looks at MARIANNE, who has gone to sit at her mother's 
               feet.WILLOUGHBYBut this place has one claim on my 
                         affection which no other can possibly 
                         share.

               MARIANNE is so irradiated with happiness that she looks like 
               an angel.WILLOUGHBYPromise me you will never change it.MRS DASHWOODI do not have the heart.ELINOROr the money.EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN PATH AND GATE - DUSKMARIANNE is seeing WILLOUGHBY off.WILLOUGHBYMiss Marianne, will you--will you do 
                         me the honour of granting me an 
                         interview tomorrow--alone?MARIANNEWilloughby, we are always alone!WILLOUGHBYBut there is something very particular

               eyes shining. He is coming to propose.EXT. LONDON TENEMENTS - NIGHTA district of extreme poverty, populated by the LOWLIFE of 
               LONDON: FOOTPADS, dogs, rats and SCAVENGERS of all kinds. In 
               the distance a tavern belches forth drunken REVELLERS who 
               sway and reel into the night.

               A hooded HORSEMAN pulls up his exhausted steed at the entrance 
               to a slum. He dismounts and looks up at one of the windows. 
               The rags hanging there twitch as if someone is watching for 
               him. He strides inside.INT. TENEMENT STAIRS - NIGHTStepping over a supine BEGGAR at the foot of the stairs, the 
               HORSEMAN flings back his hood--it is BRANDON, hollow-eyed 
               and dropping with weariness. We follow him up the stairs to 
               a door which is opened by an OLDER WOMAN.INT. TENEMENT ROOM - NIGHTHe enters a bare room partitioned with filthy rags hung from 
               the ceiling and lit with stinking tallow lamps. At the window 
               stands the slight figure of a VERY YOUNG WOMAN. She turns. 
               BRANDON reacts with a tender smile which stiffens into an 
               expression of deep shock. We see her silhouette. She is 
               heavily pregnant. She bursts into tears and runs into his 
               arms.INT. BARTON CHURCH - DAYAmongst the small CONGREGATION listening to the sermon drone

               room opposite. ELINOR and MARGARET stand by the door in utter 
               consternation, while MRS DASH- WOOD goes to MARIANNE.MRS DASHWOODWhat is wrong, my dearest?

               MARIANNE shakes her head and waves them away.INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAYELINOR, MARGARET and MRS DASHWOOD enter to find WILLOUGHBY 
               standing in a frozen attitude by the fireplace.MRS DASHWOODWilloughby! What is the matter?WILLOUGHBYI--forgive me, Mrs Dashwood. I am 
                         sent--that is to say, Lady Allen has 
                         exercised the privilege of riches 
                         upon a dependent cousin and is sending 
                         me to London.

               He cannot look any of them in the eye.MRS DASHWOODWhen--this morning?WILLOUGHBYAlmost this moment.MRS DASHWOODHow very disappointing! But your 
                         business will not detain you from us

                         idea of returning immediately to 
                         Devonshire. I am seldom invited to

                         for an invitation from Barton Cottage?WILLOUGHBYMy engagements at present are of 
                         such a nature--that is--I dare not 
                         flatter myself--

               The atmosphere is thick with tension. WILLOUGHBY flicks a 
               glance at the three WOMEN staring at him in mute astonishment.WILLOUGHBYIt is folly to linger in this manner. 
                         I will not torment myself further.

               She is silenced by ELINOR as WILLOUGHBY seizes Bedivere's 
               reins from THOMAS, mounts up and rides off at a furious pace.INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAYThey all rush back into the parlour.ELINORMeg, dearest, please ask Betsy to

               MARGARET nods dumbly and goes. MRS DASHWOOD has her arms 
               around MARIANNE.MRS DASHWOODWhat is wrong, my love?MARIANNENothing! Please do not ask me

               She runs off upstairs and we hear her bedroom door slamming. 
               There is a moment of stunned silence.ELINORThey must have quarreled.MRS DASHWOODThat is unlikely. Perhaps this--Lady 
                         Allen--disapproves of his regard for 
                         Marianne and has invented an excuse 
                         to send him away?ELINORThen why did he not say as much? It 
                         is not like Willoughby to be 
                         secretive. Did he think Marianne was 
                         richer than she is?MRS DASHWOODHow could he?

               She gestures to the room and then looks at ELINOR with a 
               frown.MRS DASHWOODWhat is it you suspect him of?ELINORI can hardly tell you. But why was 
                         his manner so guilty?MRS DASHWOODWhat are you saying, Elinor? That he 
                         has been acting a part to your sister 
                         for all this time?

               MRS DASHWOOD is getting defensive. ELINOR pauses to think.ELINORNo, he loves her, I am sure.MRS DASHWOODOf course he loves her!ELINORBut has he left her with any assurance 
                         of his return? Cannot you ask her if 
                         he has proposed?MRS DASHWOODCertainly not. I cannot force a 
                         confidence from Marianne and nor 
                         must you. We must trust her to confide

                         There was something so underhand in 
                         the manner of his leaving.MRS DASHWOODYou are resolved, then, to think the

               She stalks out of the room and starts up the stairs. ELINOR 
               follows her.ELINORMamma, I am very fond of Willoughby--

               MRS DASHWOOD goes into her bedroom and shuts the door. ELINOR 
               is halfway up the stairs. She meets a wet-eyed MARGARET coming 
               down with a cup of tea.MARGARETShe would not let me in.

               ELINOR takes the cup and MARGARET runs out into the garden 
               in tears.

               The sound of sobbing also comes from MARIANNE's room, and 
               now from MRS DASHWOOD's as well. ELINOR sits down helplessly 
               on the stairs and drinks the tea.EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - RAIN - DAYThe rain has settled in. The cottage looks cold and bleak.INT. BARTON COTTAGE - UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAYBETSY carries another uneaten meal from MARIANNE's room. She

               CHARLOTTE and MRS JENNINGS start to gossip about the

               A chorus of objections goes up, particularly from MRS 
               DASHWOOD, who is both delighted and relieved to see MARIANNE 
               with a smile on her face.MRS JENNINGSYour mother can spare you very well.MRS DASHWOODOf course I can!CHARLOTTEOf course she can!SIR JOHNAnd look at Miss Marianne--it would

               MARIANNE claps her hands, her eyes ablaze with joy. MRS 
               JENNINGS takes ELINOR's hand.MRS JENNINGSLet you and me strike hands upon the 
                         bargain--and if I do not have the 
                         three of you married by Christmas,

               She is lying on her side with her back to MARIANNE. We are 
               CLOSE on her face. MARIANNE is running around excitedly, 
               pulling out ribbons, looking at dresses, etc.MARIANNEI was never so grateful in all my 
                         life as I am to Mrs Jennings. What a 
                         kind woman she is! I like her more 
                         than I can say. Oh, Elinor! I shall 
                         see Willoughby. Think how surprised 
                         he will be! And you will see Edward!

               ELINOR cannot reply.MARIANNEAre you asleep?ELINORWith you in the room?

               MARIANNE laughs.MARIANNEI do not believe you feel as calm as 
                         you look, not even you, Elinor. I 
                         will never sleep tonight! Oh, what 
                         were you and Miss Steele whispering 
                         about so long?

               impossibility of unburdening herself to her sister without 
               breaking her promise to LUCY. After a pause--ELINORNothing of significance.

               packing.EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN GATE - DAYMRS DASHWOOD and MARGARET are waving MRS JENNINGS's carriage

               listens with new-found tolerance. LUCY is whispering into 
               ELINOR's ear.LUCYI have written to Edward, Miss 
                         Dashwood, and yet I do not know how 
                         much I may see of him. Secrecy is 
                         vital--he will never be able to call.ELINORI should imagine not.LUCYIt is so hard. I believe my only 
                         comfort has been the constancy of 
                         his affection.ELINORYou are fortunate, over such a lengthy 
                         engagement, never to have had any 
                         doubts on that score.

               LUCY looks at ELINOR sharply, but ELINOR is impassive.LUCYOh! I am of rather a jealous nature 
                         and if he had talked more of one 
                         young lady than any other... but he 
                         has never given a moment's alarm on 
                         that count.

               We can see from ELINOR's expression that she understands 
               LUCY perfectly. The strain around her eyes is pronounced.LUCYImagine how glad he will be to learn 
                         that we are friends!EXT. LONDON STREET - DAYMRS JENNINGS's carriage trundles along.EXT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - LONDON - DAYEstablishing shot of a handsome town house. MRS JENNINGS's

               a powdered FOOTMAN (MR PIGEON). ELINOR is haggard after two 
               days of close proximity with LUCY. MRS JENNINGS is all 
               officious bustle and MARIANNE is feverish with anticipation. 
               She whispers to MRS JENNINGS, who laughs heartily.MRS JENNINGSTo be sure, my dear, you must just 
                         hand it to Pigeon there. He will 
                         take care of it.

               MARIANNE hands a letter to the sphinx-like FOOTMAN. We can 
               see a large W in the address. ELINOR looks at MARIANNE 
               inquiringly but MARIANNE moves away from her.MRS JENNINGSLord above, you do not waste any 
                         time, Miss Marianne!

               MARIANNE glances self-consciously at ELINOR and follows MRS 
               JENNINGS upstairs. LUCY goes up to ELINOR and whispers.LUCYA letter! So they are definitely 
                         engaged! Mrs Jennings says your sister

                         such plan.

               But ELINOR does not know what else to say. She marches firmly 
               upstairs.INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAYMARIANNE and ELINOR have changed from their traveling clothes 
               and are having a cup of tea. At least, ELINOR is. MARIANNE 
               is pacing up and down in front of the window.ELINORJohn and Fanny are in town. I think 
                         we shall be forced to see them.

               There is a faint knocking from somewhere. MARIANNE jumps.ELINORI think it was for next door.

               MARIANNE looks out of the window.MARIANNEYes, you are right.

               She sits down with a rueful smile. Suddenly a much louder 
               rap is heard and they both jump. We hear a bustling 
               downstairs. MARIANNE can hardly breathe. She goes to the 
               drawing-room door, opens it, goes out, comes back in. We 
               hear a MAN's voice.MARIANNEOh, Elinor! It is Willoughby, indeed 
                         it is!

               She turns and almost throws herself into the arms of COLONELBRANDON.MARIANNEOh! Excuse me, Colonel--

               She leaves the room hastily. ELINOR is so ashamed of 
               MARIANNE's rudeness that she does not at first notice 
               BRANDON's mood of tense distress.ELINORColonel Brandon, what a pleasure to

                         finally resolved between your sister 
                         and Mr Willoughby?

               ELINOR is torn between discomfiture and compassion.ELINORColonel, though neither one has 
                         informed me of their under standing, 
                         I have no doubt of their mutual 
                         affection.

               BRANDON stands very still.COLONEL BRANDONThank you, Miss Dashwood. To your

                         he... may endeavour to deserve her.

               His tone is heavy with some bitter meaning.ELINORWhat do you mean?

               But he recollects himself.COLONEL BRANDONForgive me, I--forgive me.

               He bows and leaves abruptly. ELINOR is deeply troubled.EXT. GREENWICH ARCADE - LONDON - DAYThe PALMERS, MRS JENNINGS, JOHN, FANNY, LUCY, ELINOR and 
               MARIANNE are walking through the arcade. Additional wealth 
               has evidently encouraged FANNY sartorially and she sprouts 
               as much fruit and feathers as a market stall. LUCY is holding 
               ELINOR's arm in a pinionlike grip. MRS JENNINGS is gossiping 
               with CHARLOTTE.

               MARIANNE's good looks are heightened by her feverish 
               expectation of seeing WILLOUGHBY at every step, and many 
               young men raise their hats to her and turn as she passes.MARIANNEWhere is dear Edward, John? We expect 
                         to see him daily.

               FANNY stiffens. LUCY's sharp eyes dart hither and thither. 
               MRS JENNINGS senses gossip. ELINOR steels herself.MRS JENNINGSAnd who is 'dear Edward'?CHARLOTTEWho indeed?

               FANNY smiles glacially.FANNYMy brother, Mrs Jennings--Edward 
                         Ferrars.

               MRS JENNINGS looks at ELINOR in sly triumph.MRS JENNINGSIndeed! Is that Ferrars with an F?

               restlessly, her letter in her hands. A slight knock at the

               him the letter. He bows and goes, highly disgruntled.INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - HALL - MORNINGMRS JENNINGS is giving PIGEON his instructions for the day.

               and LUCY alighting from their carriage and picking their way 
               through the mud, their skirts raised above their ankles.

               not to slip into the dirt.INT. GRAND BALLROOM - EVEThe great ballroom is crammed with GUESTS all determined to 
               enjoy themselves despite the considerable inconveniences 
               caused by noise, heat and overcrowding. MEN are sweating 
               profusely, WOMEN dab their brows, rack punch is being 
               swallowed by the gallon, flirting is conducted at fever pitch 
               and all conversation is inordinately loud. Only the DANCERS 
               have a modicum of space in which to perform their mincing 
               steps. MRS JENNINGS and her brood bump into the PALMERS.CHARLOTTE(screeching)
                         This is very merry!

               MRS JENNINGS then spots FANNY, who is conducting a desultory 
               conversation with an overpowdered ACQUAINTANCE. She drags 
               ELINOR, MARIANNE and LUCY over to her.MRS JENNINGSThere you are! Goodness, how hot it 
                         is, Mrs Dashwood. You are not alone, 
                         I trust?FANNYIndeed not. John is just gone to

               FANNY has seen JOHN threading his way towards them and waves 
               at him. There is someone behind him. LUCY preens. JOHN bows

                         in-law?

               He turns to reveal a good-looking young MAN with a vacuous 
               smile.JOHNMr Robert Ferrars!ROBERTMy dear ladies--we meet at last!

               There is a general bowing and shaking of hands. ELINOR is 
               relieved. LUCY drops a low curtsy.MRS JENNINGSSo you must be the younger brother? 
                         Is Mr Edward not here? Miss Dashwood 
                         here was counting on him!

               ROBERT looks ELINOR up and down. He exchanges glances with 
               FANNY before he speaks.ROBERTOh! He is far too busy for such 
                         gatherings--and has no special 
                         acquaintance here to make his 
                         attendance worthwhile.

               MRS JENNINGS looks at ELINOR in puzzlement.MRS JENNINGSWell, I declare, I do not know what 
                         the young men are about these days--
                         are they all in hiding?

               ELINOR looks down, agonised with embarrassment.MRS JENNINGSCome, Mr Robert, in the absence of 
                         your brother, you must dance with 
                         our lovely Miss Dashwood!ROBERT(not best pleased)
                         It would be my honour.

               He turns to LUCY and bows.ROBERTAnd perhaps Miss Steele might consider 
                         reserving the allemande?

               LUCY curtsies again. ROBERT escorts a most unwilling ELINOR 
               onto the dance floor.ROBERTYou reside in Devonshire, I b'lieve, 
                         Miss Dashwood?ELINORWe do.ROBERTIn a cottage?ELINORYes.ROBERTI am excessively fond of a cottage.

               Luckily for ELINOR the set changes and she is obliged to 
               turn away from ROBERT. She wheels round to face her new 
               partner. It is WILLOUGHBY! They both stop dancing and stare 
               at each other aghast. A traffic jam starts and they are forced

                         How do you do, Miss Dashwood?

               ELINOR does not know quite how to respond.ELINORI am well, thank you, Mr Willoughby.

               She looks about for MARIANNE, instinctively wanting to keep 
               her away from WILLOUGHBY.WILLOUGHBYHow is your--family?ELINOR(cold)
                         We are all extremely well, Mr

                         inquiry.

               WILLOUGHBY is shamed into silence. Then he sees MARIANNE. At 
               the same moment the music pauses. MARIANNE looks up. In the 
               brief moment of relative quiet, her great cry rings across 
               the room.MARIANNEWilloughby!

               Everyone turns to look as MARIANNE rushes towards him with 
               both arms outstretched, her face luminous with joy. As the 
               noise of the room builds again and PEOPLE change their 
               partners, we are aware that many are surreptitiously watching. 
               MARIANNE reaches him but WILLOUGHBY stands with his arms 
               frozen at his side. MARIANNE gives a little confused laugh.MARIANNEGood God, Willoughby! Will you nor 
                         shake hands with me?

               WILLOUGHBY looks extremely uncomfortable and glances towards 
               a group of very smart PEOPLE who are watching him closely. 
               Central to this group is a SOPHISTICATED WOMAN who frowns at 
               him proprietorially.

               WILLOUGHBY shakes MARIANNE's hand briefly. Behind her, MRS 
               JENNINGS is giving an animated commentary to FANNY and JOHN, 
               while LUCY whispers in ROBERT's ear as they go past to join

                         have you not come to see me? Were 
                         you not in London? Have you nor 
                         received my letters?

               WILLOUGHBY is sweating with tension.WILLOUGHBYYes, I had the pleasure of receiving 
                         the information which you were so 
                         good as to send me.MARIANNE(piteously)
                         For heaven's sake, Willoughby, tell

                         will excuse me, I must return to my

               He bows, white to the teeth, and walks away to join theSOPHISTICATED WOMAN.MARIANNEWilloughby!

               He is drawn away by his PARTY, some of whom look back at 
               MARIANNE with a mixture of curiosity and condescension. 
               MARIANNE almost sinks to her knees. ELINOR supports her.ELINORMarianne! Come away!MARIANNEGo to him, Elinor--force him to come 
                         to me.

               They almost have to drag MARIANNE away. MRS JENNINGS turns 
               back to the DASHWOOD party. FANNY and JOHN have practically 
               imploded with embarrassment and are distancing themselves as 
               much as possible from the source. LUCY and ROBERT are dancing 
               nearby.MRS JENNINGSWill you come, Lucy?LUCYOh, are we leaving so soon?ROBERTIf I might be so bold, Mrs Jennings, 
                         it would be our pleasure to escort

               limp from lack of sleep. MRS JENNINGS is dressed to go out, 
               pulling on her gloves and bustling as usual. PIGEON enters 
               with a letter on a salver. He offers it to MARIANNE. She 
               seizes it and runs out of the room. MRS JENNINGS chuckles.MRS JENNINGSThere now! Lovers' quarrels are swift

               him.ELINORThank you for coming, Colonel.

                         twenty years ago, Eliza bore an 
                         illegitimate child. The father, 
                         whoever he was, abandoned them.

                         the unhappy resemblance between the 
                         fate of mother and daughter, and so 
                         imperfectly have I discharged my 
                         trust.

               A pause.COLONEL BRANDONI would not have burdened you, Miss 
                         Dashwood, had I not from my heart 
                         believed it might, in time, lessen 
                         your sister's regrets.

               BRANDON moves to the door and then stops. He turns to her 
               and speaks with effort.COLONEL BRANDONI have described Mr Willoughby as 
                         the worst of libertines--but I have

                         he did mean to propose that day. 
                         Therefore I cannot deny that his 
                         intentions towards Marianne were 
                         honourable, and I feel certain he 
                         would have married her, had it not 
                         been for--for the money.

               JENNINGS hustles in looking pleased.MRS JENNINGSHere is someone to cheer you up, 
                         Miss Dashwood!

               She is followed in by LUCY. MRS JENNINGS leaves, busy as 
               ever. LUCY plants an expression of ghastly concern on her 
               face.LUCYHow is your dear sister, Miss 
                         Dashwood? Poor thing! I must say, I 
                         do not know what I should do if a 
                         man treated me with so little respect.ELINORI hope you are enjoying your stay 
                         with John and Fanny, Miss Steele?LUCYI was never so happy in my entire 
                         life, Miss Dashwood! I do believe 
                         your sister-in-law has taken quite a 
                         fancy to me. I had to come and tell 
                         you--for you cannot imagine what has 
                         happened!ELINORNo, I cannot.LUCYYesterday I was introduced to Edward's 
                         mother!ELINORIndeed?LUCYAnd she was a vast deal more than 
                         civil. I have not yet seen Edward 
                         but now I feel sure to very soon--

               The MAID comes back.MAIDThere's a Mr Edward Ferrars to see 
                         you, Miss Dashwood.

               There is a tiny frozen silence.ELINORDo ask him to come up.

               ELINOR quite involuntarily sits down and then stands up again. 
               EDWARD is admitted, looking both anxious and eager. As LUCY 
               is sitting in the window seat, at first he sees only ELINOR.EDWARDMiss Dashwood, how can I--

               But ELINOR cuts him off.ELINORMr Ferrars, what a pleasure to see 
                         you. You... know Miss Steele, of 
                         course.

               EDWARD turns slowly and encounters LUCY's glassy smile. He 
               all but blanches. Then bows, and clears his throat.EDWARDHow do you do, Miss Steele.LUCYI am well, thank you, Mr Ferrars.

               EDWARD has no notion of what to do or say. He swallows.ELINORDo sit down, Mr Ferrars.

               LUCY's eyes are sharp as broken glass. EDWARD remains on his 
               feet, looking helplessly from one woman to the other.LUCYYou must be surprised to find me 
                         here, Mr Ferrars! I expect you thought 
                         I was at your sister's house.

               This is precisely what EDWARD had thought. He tries to smile 
               but his facial muscles won't work. ELINOR decides to fetch 
               help.ELINORLet me call Marianne, Mr Ferrars. 
                         She would be most disappointed to 
                         miss you.

               ELINOR goes to the door, thankful to escape, but MARIANNE 
               prevents her by walking in at that moment. Despite her 
               anguish, she is very pleased to see EDWARD and embraces him 
               warmly.MARIANNEEdward! I heard your voice! At last 
                         you have found us!

               EDWARD is shocked by her appearance and momentarily forgets 
               his own confusion.EDWARDForgive me, Marianne, my visit is 
                         shamefully overdue. You are pale. I 
                         hope you have not been unwell?MARIANNEOh, don't think of me--Elinor is 
                         well, you see, that must be enough 
                         for both of us!

               MARIANNE gestures to ELINOR encouragingly but EDWARD seems 
               unable to look at her.EDWARDHow do you like London, Marianne?MARIANNENot at all. The sight of you is all 
                         the pleasure it has afforded, is 
                         that not so, Elinor?

               Again, MARIANNE endeavours to ignite the lovers. ELINOR tries 
               to silence MARIANNE with her eyes but to no avail. MARIANNE 
               puts their coolness down to the presence of LUCY, at whom 
               she glances with a none too friendly air.MARIANNEWhy have you taken so long to come 
                         and see us?EDWARDI have been much engaged elsewhere.MARIANNEEngaged elsewhere! But what was that 
                         when there were such friends to be 
                         met?LUCYPerhaps, Miss Marianne, you think 
                         young men never honour their 
                         engagements, little or great.

               ELINOR is appalled by this remark but MARIANNE does not notice 
               it and turns back to LUCY earnestly.MARIANNENo, indeed--for Edward is the most 
                         fearful of giving pain and the most 
                         incapable of being selfish of anyone 
                         I ever saw.

               EDWARD makes an uncomfortable noise.MARIANNEEdward, will you not sit? Elinor, 
                         help me to persuade him.

               Now EDWARD can stand it no longer.EDWARDForgive me but I must take my leave--MARIANNEBut you are only just arrived!

               ELINOR rises, desperate for them both to go.EDWARDYou must excuse me, I have a 
                         commission to attend to for Fanny--

               LUCY jumps in like a shot.LUCYIn that case perhaps you might escort 
                         me back to your sister's house, Mr 
                         Ferrars?

               There is an extremely awkward pause.EDWARDI would be honoured. Goodbye, Miss 
                         Dashwood, Miss Marianne.

               He shakes hands with ELINOR and with MARIANNE, who is silent 
               with dismay. LUCY takes EDWARD's arm and looks up at him 
               proprietorially.

               After a stiff bow and a muttered farewell from EDWARD, they 
               leave. MARIANNE looks at her sister in astonishment.MARIANNEWhy did you not urge him to stay?ELINORHe must have had his reasons for 
                         going.MARIANNEHis reason was no doubt your coldness. 
                         If I were Edward I would assume you 
                         did not care for me at all.EXT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - BACK GARDEN - DAYA tranquil afternoon...INT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAYLUCY is sitting with FANNY, who is doing some pointless 
               basketwork. LUCY hands FANNY rushes.LUCYPoor Miss Marianne looked very badly 
                         t'other day. When I think of her, 
                         deserted and abandoned, it frightens 
                         me to think I shall never marry.FANNYNonsense. You will marry far better 
                         than either of the Dashwood girls.LUCYHow can that possibly be?FANNYYou have ten times their sense and 
                         looks.LUCYBut I have no dowry.FANNYThere are qualities which will always 
                         make up for that, and you have them 
                         in abundance. It would not surprise 
                         me if you were to marry far and away 
                         beyond your expectations.LUCYI wish it might be so. There is a 
                         young man--FANNYAh ha! I am glad to hear of it. Is 
                         he of good breeding and fortune?LUCYOh both--but his family would 
                         certainly oppose the match.FANNYTush! They will allow it as soon as 
                         they see you, my dear.LUCYIt is a very great secret. I have 
                         told no one in the world for fear of 
                         discovery.

               FANNY looks up, curious to know more.FANNYMy dear, I am the soul of discretion.LUCYIf I dared tell...FANNYI can assure you I am as silent as 
                         the grave.

               LUCY leans forward to whisper in FANNY's ear.EXT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - DAYWe hold a long shot of the house for a moment of silence. 
               Then from inside comes an almost inhumanly loud shriek.FANNY (V.O.)Viper in my bosom!EXT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - BACK GARDEN - DAYFANNY is trying to drag LUCY out of the house. ROBERT and 
               JOHN are trying to reason with her. FANNY loses her grip and

               for breath.MRS JENNINGSOh, my dears! What a commotion! Mr 
                         Edward Ferrars--the very one I used

                         Lucy Steele!

               MARIANNE lets out a gasp. She looks at ELINOR, who nods at 
               her in swift confirmation.MRS JENNINGSPoor Mr Ferrars! His mother, who by 
                         all accounts is very proud, demanded 
                         that he break the engagement on pain 
                         of disinheritance. But he has refused 
                         to break his promise to Lucy. He has 
                         stood by her, good man, and is cut 
                         off without a penny! She has settled 
                         it all irrevocably upon Mr Robert. 
                         But I cannot stop, I must go to Lucy. 
                         Your sister-in-law scolded her like 
                         any fury--drove her to hysterics.

               She leaves the room, still rabbiting on. There is a silence.MARIANNEHow long have you known?ELINORSince the evening Mrs Jennings offered 
                         to take us to London.MARIANNEWhy did you not tell me?ELINORLucy told me in the strictest 
                         confidence.

               MARIANNE looks at her in complete incredulity.ELINORI could not break my word.

               Clearly, there is no arguing this point.MARIANNEBut Edward loves you.ELINORHe made me no promises. He tried to 
                         tell me about Lucy.MARIANNEHe cannot marry her.ELINORWould you have him treat her even 
                         worse than Willoughby has treated 
                         you?MARIANNENo--but nor would I have him marry 
                         where he does not love.

               ELINOR tries hard to be controlled.ELINOREdward made his promise a long time 
                         ago, long before he met me. Though 
                         he may... harbour some regret, I 
                         believe he will be happy--in the 
                         knowledge that he did his duty and 
                         kept his word. After all--after all 
                         that is bewitching in the idea of 
                         one's happiness depending entirely 
                         on one person, it is not always 
                         possible. We must accept. Edward 
                         will marry Lucy--and you and I will 
                         go home.MARIANNEAlways resignation and acceptance!

                         Elinor, where is your heart?

               ELINOR finally explodes. She turns upon MARIANNE almost 
               savagely.ELINORWhat do you know of my heart? What 
                         do you know of anything but your own 
                         suffering? For weeks, Marianne, I 
                         have had this pressing on me without 
                         being at liberty to speak of it to a 
                         single creature. It was forced upon 
                         me by the very person whose prior 
                         claims ruined all my hopes. I have 
                         had to endure her exultation again 
                         and again while knowing myself to be 
                         divided from Edward forever. Believe 
                         me, Marianne, had I not been bound 
                         to silence I could have produced 
                         proof enough of a broken heart even

               Complete silence. Then MARIANNE speaks in a whisper.MARIANNEOh, Elinor!

               MARIANNE bursts into sobs and flings her arms around ELINOR,

                         Miss Dashwood, God knows what you 
                         must think of me...ELINORMr Ferrars--

               He interrupts her, desperate to explain.EDWARDI have no right to speak, I know--

               ELINOR has to stop him.ELINORMr Ferrars, I have good news. I think 
                         you know of our friend Colonel 
                         Brandon?

               EDWARD looks completely bewildered.EDWARDYes, I have heard his name.

               ELINOR starts to speak rather faster than usual.ELINORColonel Brandon desires me to say 
                         that, understanding you wish to join 
                         the clergy, he has great pleasure in 
                         offering you the parish on his estate 
                         at Delaford, now just vacant, in the 
                         hope that it may enable you--and 
                         Miss Steele--to marry.

               EDWARD cannot at first take it in. ELINOR sits down.EDWARDColonel Brandon?ELINORYes. He means it as testimony of his 
                         concern for--for the cruel situation 
                         in which you find yourselves.

               Now EDWARD sits--in shock.EDWARDColonel Brandon give me a parish? 
                         Can it be possible?ELINORThe unkindness of your family has 
                         made you astonished to find friendship 
                         elsewhere.

               EDWARD looks at ELINOR, his eyes full of growing 
               comprehension.EDWARDNo. Not to find it in you. I cannot 
                         be ignorant that to you--to your 
                         goodness--I owe it all. I feel it. I 
                         would express it if I could, but, as 
                         you know, I am no orator.ELINORYou are very much mistaken. I assure 
                         you that you owe it almost entirely 
                         to your own merit--I have had no 
                         hand in it.

               But EDWARD clearly believes she has been instrumental in the 
               offer. He frowns slightly before speaking with rather an 
               effort.EDWARDColonel Brandon must be a man of 
                         great worth and respect ability.

               ELINOR finds some relief in saying at least one thing that 
               she truly means.ELINORHe is the kindest and best of men.

               This makes EDWARD seem even more depressed. He sits silent 
               for a moment but then rouses himself to action.EDWARDMay I enquire why the Colonel did 
                         not tell me himself?ELINORI think he felt it would be better 
                         coming from... a friend.

               EDWARD looks at ELINOR, his eyes full of sadness.EDWARDYour friendship has been the most 
                         important of my life.ELINORYou will always have it.EDWARDForgive me.ELINORMr Ferrars, you honour your promises--
                         that is more important than anything 
                         else. I wish you--both--very happy.

               They rise. She curtsies. He bows.EDWARDGoodbye, Miss Dashwood.

                         our engagement. At any rate, they 
                         were married last week and are now 
                         in Plymouth.

               ELINOR rises suddenly, EDWARD turns and they stand looking 
               at one another.ELINORThen you--are not married.EDWARDNo.

               ELINOR bursts into tears. The shock of this emotional 
               explosion stuns everyone for a second and then MARIANNE makes 
               an executive decision. Wordlessly, she takes MARGARET's hand 
               and leads her and MRS DASHWOOD out of the room.EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN - DAYThe three DASHWOODS come into the garden, still holding hands.INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAYELINOR cannot stop crying. EDWARD comes forward, very slowly.EDWARDElinor! I met Lucy when I was very 
                         young. Had I had an active profession, 
                         I should never have felt such an 
                         idle, foolish inclination. At Norland 
                         my behaviour was very wrong. But I 
                         convinced myself you felt only 
                         friendship for me and it was my heart 
                         alone that I was risking. I have 
                         come with no expectations. Only to 
                         profess, now that I am at liberty to 
                         do so, that my heart is and always 
                         will be yours.

               ELINOR looks at him, her face streaked with tears of released 
               emotion, of pain and of happiness.EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDENMARIANNE and MRS DASHWOOD are stamping about in the garden 
               trying to keep warm. MARGARET has climbed into her tree-house. 
               The branches rustle.MARGARETHe's sitting next to her!MRS DASHWOOD/MARIANNEMargaret, come down!/Is he?MRS DASHWOOD(scolding)
                         Margaret! Will you stop--MARIANNEWhat's happening now?MRS DASHWOODMarianne!MARGARET (V.O.)He's kneeling down!

               MRS DASHWOOD can't help herself.MRS DASHWOODOh! Is he? Oh!

               She and MARIANNE look at each other joyfully.EXT. DOWNS NEAR BARTON - DAYThe figures of EDWARD and ELINOR can be seen walking, in 
               deep conversation.EXT. PATH NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DUSKLater. The lovers walk slowly, their heads almost touching, 
               their words low and intimate.ELINORYour mother, I suppose, will hardly 
                         be less angry with Robert for marrying 
                         Lucy.EDWARDThe more so since she settled the 
                         money upon him so irrevocably--ELINOR--no doubt because she had run out 
                         of sons to disinherit.EDWARDHer family fluctuates at an alarming 
                         rate. Then, in London, when you told 
                         me of the Colonel's offer, I became 
                         convinced that you wanted me to marry 
                         Lucy and that--well, that you and 
                         Colonel Brandon...ELINORMe and Colonel Brandon!EDWARDI shall not forget attempting to 
                         thank him for making it possible for 
                         me to marry the woman I did not love 
                         while convinced he had designs upon 
                         the woman I did--do--love.

               EDWARD stops walking. He looks at ELINOR and realises he can 
               stand it no longer.EDWARDWould you--can you--excuse me--

               He takes her face in his hands and kisses her.EXT. PATH TO BARTON CHURCH - DAYA group of VILLAGE CHILDREN run down the hillside towards 
               the church waving ribbons and dressed in their Sunday best.EXT. BARTON VILLAGE CHURCH - DAYA large wedding party is gathered outside the church. The 
               entire village is present--CHILDREN, FARMERS, LABOURERS, 
               SHOPKEEPERS, and all our PRINCIPALS. We see MRS JENNINGS in 
               a gigantic mauve bonnet, CHARLOTTE and MR PALMER, SIR JOHN, 
               MRS DASHWOOD, MARGARET, THOMAS, JOHN and FANNY, who is dressed 
               in a fantastically inappropriate concoction, and some MEN in 
               regimental uniform.

               The path to the church is strewn with wild flowers and 
               everyone holds a bunch of their own. The church bells start 
               to peal, and a great cheer goes up as the door opens and 
               BETSY comes out holding the bridal cake aloft.

               The bride and groom appear: MARIANNE, in white lawn, and 
               COLONEL BRANDON in full uniform. Behind them come EDWARD in 
               his parson's garb and, on his arm, ELINOR as matron of honour.

               CLOSE on them as they watch the party moving away. MARIANNE 
               and BRANDON make their way forwards, everyone throws their 
               flowers over them, whooping and singing. An open carriage 
               decked with bridal wreaths comes to meet them, and BRANDON 
               lifts MARIANNE in. His melancholy air is all but gone and he 
               radiates joyful life and vigour. MARIANNE also looks extremely 
               happy - but there is a gravity to her joy that makes her 
               seem much older.

               According to the custom of the time, BRANDON throws a large 
               handful of six pences into the crowd, and the VILLAGE CHILDREN 
               jump and dive for them.

               The coins spin and bounce, catching the sun like jewels. One 
               hits FANNY in the eye. She reels and falls over backwards 
               into a gorse bush. CAM pulls back as the wedding procession 
               makes its glorious way from the church. We draw away into 
               the surrounding countryside.

               Then we see, on the far edge of frame, very small, a MAN 
               sitting on a white horse, watching. It is WILLOUGHBY. As we 
               draw back further still, he slowly pulls the horse around 
               and moves off in the opposite direction.THE END
