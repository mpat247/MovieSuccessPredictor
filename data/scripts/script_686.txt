It was
           the age of the MasterBuilders. The
           world was a fluid, creative place.

           stagnant and weak. He began to
           amass power, and hunt down
           MasterBuilders. Harvesting their
           ideas. Forcing them to write
           instructions for him. Instructions
           that he in turn forced on the
           world. The remaining
           MasterBuilders went into hiding.

           things are.EMMETAnd what's the Kragle again?VITRUVIUSEvery so often, the Maker drops a
           piece down to us that is unique,

           table is but one example. Some of

          He gets somehow closer to Emmet. Mouths almost touching.NECKBEARDI was once the most feared
           MasterBuilder in all the lands. I
           lost the rest of me body fighting

           an even fight, if you follow.EMMETThank you for your clarity.
                         
          Neckbeard slowly hops back past, eyeing Emmet the whole
          time. Emmet looks to Lucy: "How can you be with him?"LUCYHe has an incredible mind.NECKBEARDEveryone hop aboard. Meet me crew.

           you're a crazy person.VITRUVIUSAh. Now, you're learning.
                         
          Emmet stares at him for a minute, confused. Then he looks
          at the mecha-bird, impressed.EMMETI could just never make something
           like that. How did you even get
           the idea?VITRUVIUSI didn't. I just opened a window

          Vitruvius smiles. But it's bittersweet.VITRUVIUSHow can I teach you something you
           already know? It's already inside
           you. You've walled it up, but it
           still shines through. That

           MakerPeepers.EMMETMakerPeepers?VITRUVIUSMakerPeepers. Emmet, there was a
           time, before you were born, when
           making new things came as
           naturally to everyone as
           breathing. The world was messy and
           wild, and that made it beautiful.
           But then, everything became rigid
           and prefabricated, so everyone
           just stopped thinking of new
           things. Making has been outsourced
           to Empura. The Black Falcon has
           paved over the world that was.

           posing as the new guards,
           determine my mother's location.
           What about a passkey, you ask? We
           won't need a passkey or whatever
           security code they have because

           how his physical disfigurement and
           my emotional disfigurement are two

           plan in a group. We'll have rules
           of play, such as 'Yes and,' not
