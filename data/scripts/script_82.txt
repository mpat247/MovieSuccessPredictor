"An American Werewolf in London" -- by John LandisFADE IN1    MAN'S FOOTPRINTon the moon.EXT. MOONCamera begins to pull back slowly, straight up - the
     song "Moon Shadow" by Cat Stevens begins.  Once we are
     high enough to see the entire moon, the main title is
     superimposed.

               An American Werewolf in London

     We continue to retreat from the moon, looking on as it
     grows farther from us, continuing credits until the
     full moon is the size it appears to us from earth.2    EXT. CROSSROADS ON THE MOORS - NIGHTTree branches enter into the frame, the camera pans
     down and we see a truck approaching.  We are at a
     crossroads in the moors, looking sinister enough to
     have earned their literary reputation.

     The truck stops at the crossroads, the DRIVER,
     mustached and wearing tweeds, boots, and a muffler,
     climbs down.

     "Moon Shadow" ends.CUT TO:Loud bang of the back grating on the truck as it slams
     down.  Revealed among the sheep are two rudely-awakened
     young American boys.  They look exhausted.  They both
     carry backpacks, two American kids on a jaunt in
     Europe.  They are both in their late twenties.

     It is very cold and they clamber out of the truck none
     too happily.  Pushing sheep aside they step out and
     stretch.JACK GOODMAN AND DAVID KESSLERThey've been cramped for hours.TRUCK DRIVERHere, lads, East Proctor and
               all about are the moors.  I go
               east here.JACKYes, well thank you very much
               for the ride, sir.  You have
               lovely sheep.TRUCK DRIVER(as he clambers back
                     up on his truck)
               Boys, keep off the moors.
               Stay on the road.  Good luck
               to you.DAVIDThanks again!

     He drives off.  LONG SHOT of the two boys as the lorry
     pulls away.  Surrounding them are the moors.  They put
     on their packs, David points to the signpost pointing
     towards East Proctor.EXT. ROAD ON THE MOORS - NIGHTAs they walk, their breath visible:JACKAre you cold?DAVIDYes.JACKGood.

     They walk on, finally:DAVIDJack.JACKDavid.DAVIDYou're not having a good time
               are you?JACKOh, I don't know.  I mean look
               around.  Isn't this a fun
               place?

     The camera shows us the moors - desolate, cold,
     foreboding.DAVIDWell, I like it here.JACKI'm sorry.  Northern England
               first, Italy later.DAVIDRight.

     They walk on.JACKDo you think she'll meet me in
               Rome?DAVIDI think Debbie Klein is a
               mediocre person with a good
               body.JACKDebbie is not mediocre and she
               has one of the great bodies of
               all time.DAVIDShe's a jerk.JACKYou're talking about the woman
               I love.DAVIDI'm talking about a girl you
               want to fuck, so give me a
               break.JACKWell, anyway, do you think
               she'll be there?DAVIDI don't know.JACK(like an announcer)
               Rendezvous in Rome starring
               Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein.

               screen dared....DAVIDIf you don't stop, I'm going
               to kill you.JACKI have to make love to her.
               It's very simple.  She has no
               choice really.DAVIDIt just fascinates me that you
               can spend so much energy on
               someone so dull.JACKIt is impossible for a body
               like that to be dull.DAVIDWe've known Debbie what, since
               the eighth grade?  How many
               years of foreplay is that?JACKShe says she `likes me too
               much'.

     David just laughs and laughs and laughs.DISSOLVETO:3    EXT. EAST PROCTOR MAIN STREET - NIGHTDavid and Jack entering East Proctor.  It is brightly
     moonlit.  East Proctor consists of a few shops, all
     closed, a petrol pump and a pub.  East Proctor has a
     very small population and the place looks empty.  David
     and Jack enter the middle of town and look about.  The
     camera sees what they see.  A few shops, dark and
     shuttered.  Light and laughter come from the pub.4    EXT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHTIts traditional shingle shows a ferocious wolf's bloody
     head on a pike, and tells us the pub's name, "The
     Slaughtered Lamb".JACKThe Slaughtered Lamb?DAVIDOf course, The Slaughtered
               Lamb.  Why else would they
               have a severed fox head on a
               spear as their symbol?JACKThat's a wolf's head.DAVIDOf course, The Slaughtered
               Lamb.  Why else would they
               have a severed wolf's head on
               a spear as their symbol?JACKThat's not a spear.  It's a
               pike.DAVIDA severed wolf's head on a
               pike as their symbol.JACKDavid, before we go in there I
               want you to know that - no
               matter what happens to us -
               it's your fault.DAVIDI assume full responsibility.JACKOkay.DAVIDShall we?5    INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHTThe pub was apparently "modernized" sometime in the mid-
     fifties.  Its traditional Englishness combines with
     greasy stainless steel and glass.  It is populated by
     mostly pale young men with longish hair.  Several older
     men are ruddy complexioned and sport large mustaches.
     Four or five are watching a chess game.  Two men are
     playing darts.  The conversation is loud and there is
     often laughter.  But there is something unsavory about
     these people.  A look of leanness and poverty.  They
     seem inbred and somehow sullen.  We establish the types
     and the general level of noise in the room.

     The door opens revealing David and Jack.  There is dead
     silence and all are staring in a not friendly way at
     the two boys who are made uncomfortable by all the
     strange attention.  They give each other a "what?"
     look, then turn to the assembled populace.DAVIDHello.JACKNice to see you.FACESSilent and staring.CUT TO:DAVID AND JACKDAVID(smiles)
               It's very cold outside.  May
               we come in?

     The WOMAN BARKEEP nods.  The boys walk carefully over
     to a table and very self-consciously remove their
     packs, place them on the floor, and sit down at the
     table.  There is a long, awkward wait.  The Woman
     finally comes over to them.JACKDo you have any hot soup?WOMANNo.DAVIDWell, do you have any coffee?WOMANNo.JACKHot chocolate?WOMANWe've got spirits and beer.
               If it's something hot you
               want, you can have tea.JACKThen you have some hot tea?WOMANNo.JACKOh.WOMANBut I can heat some up for you
               if you'd like.DAVID & JACKYes, please.

     As the Woman turns to prepare the tea, everyone resumes
     what they were doing; talking, drinking, playing chess
     and darts, and the boys breathe easier.JACKNice looking group.DAVIDListen, at least it's warm in
               here.JACKLook at that.CUT TO:JACK'S P.O.V.On the wall is painted a red pentangle (a five-pointed
     star) and on either side burns a yellow candle.DAVIDWhat about it?JACKIt's a five-pointed star.DAVIDMaybe the owners are from
               Texas.

     The Woman brings them their tea.JACK(to Woman)
          Remember the Alamo?WOMANI beg your pardon?DAVIDHe was joking.  Thank you.WOMANJoking?  I remember The Alamo.
               I saw it once in London, in
               Leicester Square.

     Jack and David look startled.  One of the CHESS PLAYERS
     explains:CHESS PLAYERShe means in the cinema, that
               film with John Wayne.
                    (turns to board)
               Checkmate.DAVIDOh, yes, of course.JACKRight, with Laurence Harvey
               and everybody died in it.  It
               was very bloody.CHESS PLAYERBloody awful if you ask me!

     This sends everyone into gales of laughter.  Jack and
     David smile politely.CHESS PLAYERHere, Gladys, Tom.  Did you
               hear the one about the
               crashing plane?WOMANNo, but we're about to.

     Laughter.CHESS PLAYERYou be quiet, woman, and let
               me speak.WOMAN(heavy sarcasm)
               Quiet, everyone!  Hush!  Shhh!

     Uproarious laughter.CHESS PLAYERAll right, laugh then.  I
               shan't tell it.WOMANOh, come on, tell us.CHESS PLAYERNo.  You've had your chance.

     The men all coax him to tell the joke.JACK(to David)
               Ask them what the candles are
               for.DAVID(to Jack)
               You ask them.JACK(to David)
               Listen, that's a pentangle, a
               five-pointed star.  It's used
               in witchcraft.  Lon Chaney,
               Jr. and Universal Studios
               maintain it's the mark of the
               wolf man.DAVID(to Jack)
               I see.  You want me to ask
               these people if they're
               burning candles to ward off
               monsters.JACK(to David)
               Right.DAVID(to Jack)
               Wrong.
     The drinkers have gotten the Chess Player to tell the
     joke as everyone knew he would.CHESS PLAYEROh, all right.  There was this
               airplane over the Atlantic on
               its way to New York.  It was
               full of men from the United
               Nations.WOMANThat's very funny, that is.

     Uproarious laughter.JACK(to David)
               Go on, ask them.DAVID(to Jack)
               You ask them.CHESS PLAYERHere now, let me finish!  So
               halfway over the ocean the
               engines run low on petrol so
               they have to lighten the
               plane.  So they heave out all
               the baggage, but it's still
               too heavy.  So they chuck out
               the seats, but it's still too
               heavy!  Finally this Froggy
               steps up and shouts "Viva la
               France" and leaps out.  Then
               an Englishman....DART PLAYERSHear!  Hear!CHESS PLAYER(undaunted)
               ...steps up and shouts `God
               save the Queen!' and leaps
               out.  But the plane is still
               too heavy.  So the Yank
               delegate from Texas steps up,
               shouts, `Remember the Alamo!'
               and chucks out the Mexican.

     This is apparently the funniest joke the inhabitants of
     East Proctor have ever heard.  The laughter is
     uproarious, choking, knee-slapping, incredible.  As the
     Chess Player goes to take a drink of beer, the Dart
     Player gasps out...DART PLAYERRemember the Alamo!

     ...causing the Chess Player to spit out his beer
     causing even harder laughter.  Complete hilarity.JACKExcuse me, but what's that
               star on the wall for?

     Dead silence.  A dart lands in the wall.  David and
     Jack are understandably bewildered.  The villagers look
     hard indeed.DART PLAYER(angry)
               You've made me miss.JACKI'm sorry.DART PLAYERI've never missed the board
               before.DAVIDJack, we'd better go.JACKWhat do you mean?  I'm
               starving.DART PLAYERThere's no food here.

     The villagers look threatening and David's voice is a
     bit urgent.DAVIDCome on, Jack, shall we go?!!JACKApparently so.

     The boys pick up their backpacks and move uncertainly
     for the door.WOMAN(to men)
               You can't let them go.DAVID(worried)
               How much do we owe you?CHESS PLAYERNothing, lads.  Go, God be
               with you.DAVIDUh, thank you.WOMANWait!  You just can't let them
               go!DART PLAYERGo!  And stay on the road.
               Keep clear of the moors.DAVIDYes, well, thanks again.CHESS PLAYERBeware the moon, lads!

     David pushes Jack out.6    EXT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHTIt is very cold.JACKWhat the hell was that all
               about?DAVIDI don't know.  Let's see if
               there's an inn or something up
               the road.JACKBeware the moon?DAVIDCome on, I'm freezing.

     They start up the road into the night.7    INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHTIt is quiet.WOMANYou can't let them go.DART PLAYER(angry)
               Should the world know our
               business?!CHESS PLAYERIt's murder then.DART PLAYERThen murder it is!  It's in
               God's hands now.

     The wax drips from the Pentangle's candles onto the
     floor.DISSOLVETO:8    EXT. A ROAD ON THE MOORS - NIGHT - DAVID AND JACKwalking on the road surrounded by darkness.DAVIDThat was weird.  I guess
               leaving was the best idea.JACKI don't know.  Now that we're
               out here and it's three
               degrees, I'm not so sure I
               wouldn't rather face a blood-
               thirsty mob.DAVIDWell, not quite a blood-
               thirsty mob.

     They keep walking.JACKWhat do you think was wrong?DAVIDI have no idea.JACKMaybe that pentangle was for
               something supernatural.DAVIDI see and they were too
               embarrassed to talk about it,
               because they felt so silly.
     There is a flash of lightning that sends a ghostly
     illuminating sheet of light over the boys' faces.  The
     clap of thunder follows loud and rumbling.DAVIDPlease don't rain.

     Downpour.  The boys are walking in a deluge.DAVIDOf course.

     They walk getting soaked.JACKSay, David....DAVIDI'm well aware of how pleasant
               the weather is in Rome at the
               present time thank you.

     Jack spreads his arms and sings.JACKSanta Lucia...Santa Lucia.9    INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHTThe rain is loud on the roof and beating on the
     windows.  The gathered continue to drink, play chess
     and darts, but all are silent and contemplative.WOMANPerhaps they'll be safe in the
               rain.

     The Chess Player slams his hand on the table.  Shouts:CHESS PLAYERNo one brought them here!  No
               one wanted them here!WOMANYou could have told them!DART PLAYERAre you daft?  What do you
               think they'd say?  They'd
               think us mad.WOMANListen!

     The rain is subsiding.  There is a very faint howl.WOMANDid you hear it?  We must go
               to them.DART PLAYERI heard nothing.CHESS PLAYERNor I.

     The camera lingers as the Chess Player's hard face
     shows the man's struggle.  Another howl.  The Chess
     Player turns suddenly.10   EXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHTDavid and Jack are now completely out of sight from
     East Proctor surrounded by darkness and wet.  There is
     a light drizzle.  They are standing, listening.  The
     drizzle stops.JACKDid you hear that?DAVIDI heard that.JACKWhat was it?

     David begins to walk, Jack with him.DAVIDCould be a lot of things.JACKYeah?DAVIDA coyote.JACKThere aren't any coyotes in
               England.DAVIDThe Hound of the Baskervilles.JACKPecos Bill.DAVIDHeathcliffe.JACKHeathcliffe didn't howl.DAVIDNo, but he was on the moors.JACKIt's a full moon, `beware the
               moon'.

     Another howl, this one long and loud.  It is a very
     inhuman noise, terrifying, and closer this time.JACKI vote we go back to The
               Slaughtered Lamb.DAVIDYeah.

     They are both visibly worried and walk briskly back
     from where they just came.  Although after a bit of
     fast walking they are getting nowhere.  They stop out
     of breath.DAVIDWe're lost.

     Another bloodcurdling howl.JACKShit!  David, what is that?DAVIDI don't know.  Come on.JACKCome on, where?DAVIDAnywhere!  I think we should
               just keep moving.

     A growl.  A low guttural growl comes from out of the
     darkness.  We stay on the boys, but we hear something
     out there.  It starts to walk.DAVIDIt's moving.JACKIt's circling us.

     And indeed it is.  The boys strain to hear its four
     footfalls and they turn slowly, following it.  A snarl.JACKFuck.

     We hear the wolf-monster stop (for that's what it is -
     we know it's there even though we've not seen it).  It
     sits breathing heavily.DAVIDWhat's the plan?JACK(nervously)

               in the moors.  Tra-la-la,
               isn't this fun?

     The thing stalking them seems to speed up.  The boys
     hesitate as they sense it run past them.  It stops.DAVIDIt's in front of us.JACKDo you think it's a dog?

     Jack and David strain to see what waits ahead of them.BOYS' P.O.V.Something is waiting in the darkness.  Its hulking
     shape is barely discernible, but its eyes glow eerily
     and its breath is visible.JACKOh shit.  What is that?DAVIDA sheep dog or something.
               Turn slowly and let's walk
               away.

     The boys keep talking as they move faster and faster.JACKNice doggie.  Good boy.DAVIDWalk away, Jack.JACKWalking away, yes, sir.  Here
               we are walking away.

     They are in a full-out run by now.  After a few minutes
     flight they stop, panting.DAVIDSee anything?JACKNo.

     A moment of quiet, then a howl.DAVIDIt sounds far away.JACKNot far enough.  Come on.

     They walk briskly.DAVIDJack?JACKYeah.DAVIDWhere are we going?JACKI'll tell you when we get
               there.DAVIDWell.  I'm glad we...WHOAA!!

     David shouts as he slips suddenly in the mud, scaring
     Jack, and us, and himself a great deal.  He lays
     startled on the wet ground for a moment, then he and
     Jack laugh.JACKYou really scared me, you
               shithead.DAVIDAre you going to help me up?

     David falls back on his ass.  Jack is screaming and
     struggling as he is torn to shreds.  David scrambles to
     his feet and runs in complete panic.  Jack's screams
     and the wolf's roars combine.JACKJesus fuck!  David!  Please

     hulking form rolls off of him.EXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHTDavid, dazed and bloody, looks and sees the men from
     The Slaughtered Lamb armed with shotguns and torches
     running towards him.  Looking over at his attacker,
     instead of a wolf he sees a very old, naked man laying
     in the mud riddled with bullet holes.  As the villagers

     face, but he really doesn't look too bad.  He opens his
     eyes slowly, blinks, and tries to sit up and look

     David is getting interested.DAVIDCall me David.ALEXShall I be forced to feed you,
               David?DAVIDThis is absurd.  I'm not
               hungry.  I don't want any
               food.ALEXRight.

     Alex efficiently removes the covers from the dishes and
     sits on the edge of the bed.  Taking knife and fork in
     hand, she neatly cuts David's food into pieces.  David
     watches all this amused.  She places a napkin under
     David's chin and holds up his first bite on his fork.
     David folds his arms and refuses to open his mouth.ALEXLet's try a little harder,
               shall we?DAVIDWill you give me a break?

     Alex grabs David's nose forcing his mouth open quickly,
     shoving the fork in it.  David is startled, but amused
     and chews his food slowly and swallows it.  Alex holds
     up another bite.ALEXWill I have to take such
               drastic action again, David?

     David opens his mouth obediently.  Alex almost smiles.
     She feeds him for a while; they are both sizing each
     other up.  Finally:DAVIDMay I have a glass of milk?

     Alex smiles.FADE OUTFADE IN22   EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAYAgain we are running fast and faster.  David again
     running naked, flying through the green forest.  He
     stops suddenly, ears perked, he looks about and then we
     hear Jack's o.s. screams.  The voice of Jack screams:JACK (O.S.)David!  David!  Please help
               me!  Oh God!  David!  Oh my
               God!

     David turns in blind panic, he runs (and we run with
     him) desperately trying to find the source of Jack's
     screams.

     He comes to a clearing in the woods, light streaming
     through the tall trees.  Jack's screams halt in mid-
     word.  David looks in disbelief at the clearing.  There
     is a hospital bed with someone in it.  It is the same
     as David's.

     David walks toward it slowly.  The figure in the bed
     lays still.  It grows dark, very dark, and David looks
     up at the full moon.  There is a howl identical to the
     one heard earlier back on the moors.  David approaches
     the bed slowly, fearfully.  We hear ocean noises on the
     soundtrack, the sound of crashing surf.  David reaches
     out to pull back the covers, lightning and thunder
     cause him to hesitate for a second.  Silence.  The
     camera remains on David as he pulls off the covers.
     His face registers total disbelief and increasing
     horror.

     We cut to the bed to find - DAVID.  He lies there, pale
     white with purple lips and death pallor.

     The camera begins to move in on the corpse of David.

     Cut back to the standing David's terrified face; then
     continue until David's death mask fills the screen.
     The face remains still for several beats, then suddenly
     opens its bright yellow eyes and red mouth revealing
     fangs in a bloodcurdling wail which carries over in

               I came across the curious
               stranger whom I am going to
               talk about.  He attracted me
               by three things: his candid
               simplicity, his marvelous
               familiarity with ancient
               armor, and the restfulness of
               his company - for he did all
               the talking.  We fell together
               as modest people will in the
               tail of the herd....DISSOLVETO:26   INT. KESSLER HOME - NEW YORK - NIGHTWe are at David's parents' house in New York.  His
     FATHER sits reading the paper in the living room as his
     younger BROTHER and SISTER watch "The Muppet Show" on
     television.  We can see past the small dining nook
     where David sits doing homework and into the kitchen
     where his MOTHER is washing the dishes.  A peaceful
     lower, middle class setting.  All is tranquil and
     secure.  There is a loud pounding on the front door.FATHERI'll get it.

     The pounding continues.FATHERAll right, all right!  Hold
               your horses.

     (The following happens with shocking speed.)  When he
     opens the door, four beings open fire with machine
     guns, blowing him away.  The sudden burst of violence
     is terrifying and unrelenting.  The four rush into the
     room and the family looks at them in fearsome surprise
     for these men are not human at all, but loathsome,
     bestial demons dressed as Storm Troopers.  One kicks in
     the television and fires into the kitchen, blasting
     David's mother.  David rises but is forced back into
     his chair by one of the things and held there.DAVIDStop!

     He watches in horror as his little brother and sister
     scream in terror before they are brutally murdered.
     The monstrous Storm Troopers then set fire to the
     rooms.  The one holding David pulls a knife and quickly
     slits David's throat.CUT TO:27   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHTDavid bolts upright in bed and looks around, trying
     desperately to gain his bearings.  He sees that Alex is
     asleep in the chair by his bed, Connecticut Yankee

     calm himself.  He considers waking her, then decides
     against it.  He turns on the lamp by his bed and
     reaches over to take the book from Alex's lap.  David
     takes the book as gently as possible, but Alex wakes up

     trying to fully wake up during the Orderly's speech,

     spoon into the bowl of oatmeal and tastes is gingerly.DAVID(in mock English accent)

     toast and drink his juice.  While he eats, we hear
     Jack's o.s. voice.JACK (O.S.)Can I have a piece of toast?

     David looks over to the o.s. Jack.  Jack, behaving
     relaxed and normal, sits in the chair last occupied by
     Alex.  However, Jack's appearance makes his casual
     manner all the more surreal.  He is as we left him
     butchered on the moors.  He is covered with dried mud
     and open wounds.  Huge glistening gashes abound on his
     body.  His face is scratched, his throat is badly torn,
     and his hair is matted with blood.  In several spots he
     has already begun to rot.  He is a remarkably gruesome
     sight, but his physical state seems not to affect him
     at all.JACK(pleasantly)

     Jack gets up and takes a piece of toast from David's
     tray as David watches amazed.  Jack returns to his seat

     hoping the steady stream doesn't awaken Alex.  When
     he's finished peeing he goes to the sink.  The medicine
     cabinet door over the sink is open.  When David closes
     it he (and the audience) is terrified to see Jack
     reflected standing behind him.  (Note: This is a big
     scare.)  Bloodied and horrible, Jack has continued to
     rot and looks even worse than when we last saw him.
     David chokes out a strangled cry, closes his eyes
     tightly and then reopens them.  Jack is still there in
     the mirror.  When David turns around Jack is standing
     in the doorway.DAVID(points a trembling

     Alex is dressed in her nurse's uniform and David has
     jeans and a T-shirt on.  He is shoeless and obviously
     not going out.  Alex pulls away.ALEXLet me go now, you'll make me

     They kiss again.ALEXI'm off.  There's food in the
               fridge.DAVIDSee you later.

     Alex goes off, turning for a last wave.  David stands
     looking after her when a LITTLE GIRL walking a dog
     passes by.  The dog, on seeing David, begins to growl
     and snarl.DAVID(to dog)
               What did I do?

     The dog begins barking ferociously, the little girl
     tugging on his leash.DAVIDThanks a lot, dog.

     He realizes just how cold he is outside and runs back
     up the steps to find the door locked.DAVIDWonderful.

     Cut to shot of David's bare feet on the cold stone.  He
     mutters to himself, imitating a newscaster.DAVIDAn American werewolf was found
               frozen to death today in the
               heart of London, England.

     He looks around and sees that there is a small window
     ajar on the side of the flat about eleven feet off the
     ground, which can be reached by climbing a brick wall,
     which he does but not without damage to his bare toes.

     At the top of the wall is a cat that begins to hiss on
     seeing David.  The hair stands up on its arched back
     and it glares at David, hissing and spitting.  David is
     disturbed by the cat's hostile behavior.DAVIDWhat did I do, cat?

     The cat is really acting fierce.  When David goes to
     pat it cautiously, it screeches and runs away.  David
     is, by this time, not amused.  David manages to pull
     himself into the window.47   INT. ALEX'S BATHROOM - DUSKDavid awkwardly enters the bathroom through the tiny
     window.  Finally getting both feet on the ground, he
     steps to the sink and regards himself in the mirror.DAVID(weakly)
               Snarl.  Growl.  Grrrr.

     He examines his mouth, touching his canines carefully.
     After a while he sighs and goes into the kitchen.48   INT. ALEX'S KITCHEN - DUSKDavid goes straight to the fridge and opens it.  He
     closes the fridge and walks into the bedroom.49   INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - DUSKHe lays down on the bed.  After a few beats of staring
     at the ceiling, he rises and goes back into the
     kitchen.50   INT. ALEX'S KITCHEN - DUSKHe reopens the fridge.DAVIDI'm not hungry.

     He closes the fridge and walks into the living room.51   INT. ALEX'S LIVING ROOM - DUSKDavid turns on the television.  On Thames is a soccer
     match.  On BBC 1 is some truly insipid children's
     program, and on BBC 2 is a soccer match.  David
     switches off the television.

     He sits on the chair nervously, drumming his fingers
     and humming.DAVID(singing)
               `Moon River, wider than a mile
               I'm crossing you in style,
               Someday....'

     David gets up, goes to the front door, and flings it
     open.  It is getting dark.  David views this fearfully,
     but still not completely convinced.  He goes back
     inside and we note that the front door is not
     completely closed.  He goes back into the bathroom and
     looks into the mirror.DAVIDFee fi fo fum, I smell the
               blood of an Englishman.

     He goes back into the living room and paces round and
     round the room like a caged animal.52   INT. CHILDREN'S WARD - NIGHTAlex is back with Benjamin, the little Pakistani.ALEXHow are we feeling tonight?BENJAMINNo.ALEXNo what?BENJAMINNo!ALEX(smiling)

     For the first time, Benjamin smiles.  As Alex tucks him
     in, we can clearly see the full moon outside through
     the window.53   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - NIGHTDavid sits reading Connecticut Yankee when he suddenly
     clutches his head in pain.DAVIDJesus Christ!

     He stands in agony, the book falls to the floor.DAVID(screams)
               What?  Christ!  What?

     He begins sweating profusely, clinging to the sides of
     his head.  He trembles violently.DAVIDI'm burning up!  Jesus!

     He rips at his shirt, tearing it off.  His body is
     dripping wet.DAVID(shouts out in
                     pain and fear)
               Jack!?  Where are you now, you
               fucker!?!

     As a new spasm of pain wracks his body, he cries out in
     anguish.DAVIDHelp me!  Somebody help me,
               please!  Jack!!

     David's hair is wringing wet.  He screams and grabs at
     his legs.DAVID(pleading, whimpering)
               I'm sorry I called you a meat
               loaf, Jack.

     New bolts of agonizing pain wrack through David's body.
     He grabs at his pants, pulling them off as if they are
     burning him.
     Standing naked in the center of the room, David gasps
     for air.

     He falls to his knees and then forward on his hands.
     He remains on his hands and knees, trying to master his
     torment; but it's no use.  On all fours he gives
     himself over to the excruciating hurt and slowly begins
     to change.

     The metamorphosis from man into beast is not an easy
     one.  As bone and muscle bend and reform themselves,
     the body suffers lacerating pain.  We can actually see
     David's flesh move, the rearranging tissue.  His mouth
     bleeds as fangs emerge.  His whole face distorts as his
     jaw extends, his skull literally changing shape before
     our eyes.  His hands gnarl and his fingers curl back as
     claws burst forward.

     The camera pans up to show the full moon outside
     through the window.  David's moans change slowly into
     low guttural growls.  We hear the four footfalls as the
     WOLF begins to walk.  As the camera pans back over the
     room, we see the front door pushed open and hear the
     Wolf padding off into the darkness.54   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHTA taxi pulls up in front of a block of flats.  An

     Harry takes her hand and leads her around the side of

     Wolf whirls around and goes for her throat.  We can't
     see clearly, but we see enough to realize how large the
     Wolf is and that its wolfen features are twisted and
     demonic.  The Wolf savagely devours its two victims.56   INT. SEAN'S FLAT - NIGHTSean's wife is looking through their French windows out

               his werewolf fantasies?ALEXWell, yes, but he seems to be
               more upset by the death of his
               friend.DR. HIRSCHHas his friend appeared to him
               again?ALEXYes.DR. HIRSCHWhat did he say?ALEXDavid says Jack comes to warn
               him.DR. HIRSCHWarn him?ALEXDr. Hirsch, what's wrong?  Is
               this more serious than I know?DR. HIRSCHI tried to investigate the
               attack.  There are no records.
               The case was closed and now
               they've `misplaced' the file.
               David's lacerations were
               cleaned and dressed when he
               arrived here and yet
               supposedly no doctor examined
               him before I did.  The Goodman
               boy is already in the ground
               so he's no good to us.  So I
               went to the pub in East
               Proctor where I was convinced
               of two things.ALEXYes.DR. HIRSCHThey were lying.  There were
               no witnesses, no escaped
               lunatic.  The whole community
               is hiding the truth of what
               actually happened up there.ALEXAnd what else?DR. HIRSCHI think the village of East
               Proctor is hiding some dark
               and terrible secret.  I'm
               convinced that, like David,
               they believe in this werewolf.

     Alex is flabbergasted.DR. HIRSCHYou've absolutely no idea
               where David might be?ALEXNo.  He knows no one in
               London, besides me.  I
               shouldn't have left him alone.

     Suddenly.ALEXSurely you're not
               suggesting....DR. HIRSCHDavid has suffered a severe
               trauma.  I myself witnessed
               some form of mass neurosis in
               East Proctor.  If all the
               villagers believe that Jack
               Goodman was killed by a
               werewolf, why shouldn't David?
               And then it follows that if he
               survived an attack by a
               werewolf, wouldn't he himself
               become a werewolf the next
               full moon?ALEX(bewildered)

               the moon.  But in such a
               deranged state he could harm
               himself, or perhaps others.ALEXWhat shall we do?DR. HIRSCHLet's call the police and see

     completely naked, his body dirty, with several
     scratches on his torso and legs.  He yawns and
     stretches, makes a face, and with his finger picks

     suitable hiding place and dashes behind some bushes.

     He runs out into the street.  Cars slam on their

     It's too late.  He's lost in traffic.  Alex stands for
     a moment not knowing which way to turn.78   EXT. ALLEY - DAYDavid is running in panic.  He finally comes to rest in

     Dr. Hirsch is talking to Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus.LT. VILLIERSThe forensic lads seem to feel
               that some sort of animal was

     He hangs up in profound depression.  Leaving the booth
     he sees an outdoor clock.  It is 4:15.  He sighs, then
     catches sight of something.81   EXT. CINEMA - DAY - DAVID'S P.O.V.There stands Jack, now truly rotted and ghastly.  He's
     pretty much dried out, a third of his face gone
     revealing the grinning skull.  He waves to David.  Jack
     points inside the theater and goes in.  David smiles,
     walks across the intersection, and up to the box
     office.TICKET LADYTwo and a half quid, please.

     David reaches in his pocket.  All he has are traveler's
     checks.DAVIDWill you take a traveler's

     She gives him a ticket.  David goes in.82   INT. CINEMA - DAYA film (to be determined) plays on screen.  The small
     theater is mostly empty.  A few snoring BUMS and wide-
     eyed CHILDREN are scattered about.  Jack sits in the
     last row in the shadows.  He waves to David.  David
     goes and sits next to him.DAVIDHi, Jack.JACKHi, David.

     They sit for a while watching the screen.DAVIDWhat can I say, Jack?JACKYou don't have to say

               those people.  I don't
               remember doing it.JACKWhat about the zoo?DAVIDWell, even if I'm not the
               wolfman, I am crazy enough to

               Square talking to a corpse.

               people.

     Sitting down the row from Jack is a man, GERALD
     BRINGSLY, completely in the shadow.JACKDavid Kessler, this is Gerald
               Bringsly.DAVIDHello.JACKGerald is the man you murdered
               in the subway.  We thought it

               Yes, I do look most

     Bringlsy leans forward almost into the light, he
     glistens.BRINGSLYYou must die, David Kessler.JACKDavid, this is Harry Berman
               and his fiancee Judith Browns.

     The two victims lean forward from their seats next to
     Mr. Bringsly.  We can just make out that Harry has one
     arm missing.JACKAnd these gentlemen are Alf,
               Ted, and Joseph.

     The Three Derelicts sit next to Harry and Judith.  All

     illuminating their gore.DERELICT #2Can't say we're pleased to

     As the conversation continues, the camera pulls back
     from the grisly tableau.  David grabs his head
     suddenly.CUT TO:83   EXT. BIG BEN - NIGHTThe clock strikes eleven.  The full moon is up.84   INT. CINEMA - NIGHTDavid is dripping wet and shaking violently.  Three

     hair splits his skin.  The children's eyes widen in
     fascination.85   EXT. CINEMA - NIGHTRoars and screams come from inside the theater.  The
     TICKET TAKER at the door says to the Ticket Lady:TICKET TAKERI'll check on the house.

     He goes inside the theater.86   INT. CINEMA - NIGHTThe Ticket Taker enters the theater.  The movie
     continues on screen, but all else is quiet.  He
     cautiously continues down the aisle.  He sees something
     and makes his way towards it.  He looks down in horror.THE WOLF SPRINGS!CUT TO:87   EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE - NIGHTFrom way up high we look down on the sidewalks and

     One cop stays with the lady, the other rushes inside.89   INT. CINEMA - NIGHTThe cop enters a side door to find several bloodied
     corpses.  He hears something, looks over to see the
     Wolf hunched over a victim.  The Wolf turns, eyes
     blazing, mouth dripping with blood.  We see it clearly
     for the first time.  It is truly a hound from hell, its
     wolfen features a hideous sight.  Its eyes fierce,
     burning green.  The Wolf roars and starts for the cop.
     The cop rushes out and slams the door behind him.90   EXT. CINEMAAs the cop bolts the door shut.COP #1For God's sake, Tom, there's a

     Suddenly the doors splinter apart and there stands the
     Wolf, eyes blazing.  It leaps on Lt. Villiers, savaging
     him.  The crowd falls back in panic.

     The Wolf runs into traffic, a cab swerves to avoid
     hitting it and plows into fleeing pedestrians hurling
     one through a shop window.  Mass confusion as orders
     are shouted and the police pursue the Wolf.

     It runs down an alleyway into a cul de sac.  It stops
     in the darkness, blocked by a brick wall.  The Wolf
     whirls around, defiant, roaring.  The cops quickly
     barricade the entrance to the alley.94   INT. TAXI - NIGHTThe taxi is halted by the traffic jam in Leicester
