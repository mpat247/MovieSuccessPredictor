                                July 16, 2003TITLES OVER YELLOW BACKGROUND.We PULL BACK to reveal we're looking at THE SUN. In the
distance lie the gorgeous San Gabriel Mountains and the
Downtown Los Angeles skyline.
In ONE LONG TRACKING SHOT, we CRANE PAST some trees to reveal
the vast expansive homes scattered in the hills of Brentwood.
HOMEOWNERS walk dogs, a PAPERBOY chucks papers fr9m a
gleaming mountain bike... It's early in the morning, and the
landscapers haven't come with their leaf blowers yet.
CONTINUE BOOMING DOWN to road level to face    the resplendent
Martin residence. We STEADICAM down the fr    ont walk, able to
admire the manicured hedges and the black E   scalade in the
driveway, to the front door decorated with    a whimsical
placard that reads, "The Martins" -- and we    pass THROUGH THE
KEYHOLE into the foyer.INT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - MORNINGWe TRACK through the living room, passing framed photos of an
athletic eleven year old boy, and we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE as
she comes down the stairs with a GOLDEN RETRIEVER at her
side.WOMAN(into phone)
          Yes Donna, I'm out the door.
We TRACK over the Woman's shoulder and follow her into the
kitchen, unable to see her face.WOMAN (CONT'D)Just inform Kayleigh that
          anesthesia is on the way to prep
          the epidural and I'll be there as
          soon as I can.
Still looking over her shoulder, we watch her absently
straighten a PHOTOGRAPH of her son on the fridge as she
talks.WOMAN (CONT'D)And promise her she's about to have
          a woooonnderful labor.
As the woman pours herself a fresh cup of coffee, her
HOUSEKEEPER enters the kitchen with a full laundry basket.
They give each other a silent wave.WOMAN (CONT'D)Right, I'll see you in twenty.
She hangs up her cordless and takes a breath as we COME
AROUND to finally REVEAL JESSICA MARTIN; slightly weary, but
ready for the day ahead.JESSICABuenas dias, Rosario.ROSARIOGood morning Miss Jessica.
Jessica sees her answering machine blinking, hits PLAY.
In the background, a cheerful Rosario enters frame and heads
for the back door carrying the basket of laundry.MALE VOICE(on machine)
           Honey? Honey, wake up.   Pick up the-
And as she brings the coffee cup to her lips--
SLAMM!! The door EXPLODES open and a squad of FIVE GUNMEN
storm in, wearing SKI-MASKS. Everything is a whirlwind of
quick cuts, noise and confusion.
Jessica's DOG starts to lunge at the men and -- thup! -- is
stilled by a silenced pistol before its second bark.
Rosario runs for the ALARM SYSTEM --LEAD GUNMANGet away from there! Don't touch
          that -- !!
-- but as she reaches out for the PANIC BUTTON -- BLAM!!     He
blows her away, too. The Gunman curses, then turns on
Jessica.LEAD GUNMAN (CONT'D)(dire)
          Where is he?
Jessica cringes.JESSICAWhere is who?LEAD GUNMANWrong answer.
The bastard hauls back and -- WHAM I -- punches her in the
face, knocking Jessica cold.
Then he turns to his men.LEAD GUNMAN (CONT'D)Search the house.
And as the answering machine fills the silence:CRAIG VO(on machine)
          -I'll call back later.
The LEAD GUNMAN spins around, and we PUSH INTO the blackness
of his masked face.MATCH CUT TO:EXT. KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE - DAYThe BLACKNESS of a BLACK VAN and ESCALADE passing below us.
We quickly CRANE DOWN to see the vehicles traveling through:
An IRON GATE at the edge of an aband9ned property. They
bounce down a long lonely driveway lined with barren trees--
ANGLE ON: THE KIDNAPPERS' VAN as it arrives at its
destination; an isolated HOUSE in the Hills. The grass is
dead. The trees are dead. It's the kind of place you could
scream for a week and no one would hear a thing.
As the van stops--WE PUSH INTO ITS DOORS:INT. DARKENED ATTIC - KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSEA door CRASHES open. Light slices through the dark revealing
the dusty, skeletal interior. Jessica is hurled into the
room and falls to the floor. With bound hands, she
frantically pulls her blindfold off to see--THE LEAD SKI-MASKED KIDNAPPERStanding in front of her.    Sturdier than the rest.   Solid.
Imposing.JESSICAWh... what do you want?
Unsettlingly, the Kidnapper says nothing, staring at her.
Jessica tries to remain calm under his angry gaze...
Then suddenly, the Kidnapper turns and exits the room.
Jessica breathes a sigh of relief...but it catches in her
throat as he returns ten seconds later -- with a BASEBALL BAT.
Grim as death, he stalks toward her --JESSICA (CONT'D)No, wait..
And reaching.her, he hauls back and SWINGS --JESSICA (CONT'D)NO!   PLEASE--//SMASH! The bat connects with a wooden beam an inch above
Jessica's head, OBLITERATING the ROTARY DIAL TELEPHONE that
hung there.
As phone guts shower down on her, the Lead Kidnapper turns
and stomps away, slamming the attic door shut and locking
Jessica in the darkness.
Only now that they're gone does Jessica allow her fear to
show through. Trembling, tears running down her face,
Jessica finally breaks down, pleading to the empty attic--JESSICA (CONT'D)Wha... what the hell is happening?!
The attic's suffocating silence is the only answer she gets.DISSOLVE TO:THE OCEANSkimming along the water.
And we TILT UP to reveal the majestic beaches of Southern
California, and at the center of it all, the SANTA MONICAPIER.EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - MORNING - ESTABLISHINGIt would be a typical day, except for that some PEOPLE are
preparing for a "HEAL THE BAY" rally at the end of the pier.
VENDORS set up, preparing for the daily grind ahead.
BIKERS gather around a bad-ass HELLCAT G2 CONFEDERATE
MOTORCYCLE and admire its cutting-edge design.
HOT CHICKS in bikinis try on sunglasses at a stand.
FISHERMEN crack beers while awaiting the next bite.INT. SANTA MONICA PIER - ARCADE - MORNINGANGLE ON - ARCADE GAME SCREEN.The screen displays a car-race arcade game. A computer
generated hot-rod passes other racers at breakneck speed.
Playing the sit-down game, DAYTONA USA, is:
RYAN ACKERMAN, early twenties, looks like he grew up on the
beach without so much as a pot to piss in. His lethal
reflexes and bold recklessness, however, have made him a Jedi
Master of the game.
Ryan's score approaches the HIGH SCORE at the top of the
screen.RYANYou recording this?CHAD (OS)Yeah, sure...
CHAD, his best bud, aims a BLUE TOOTH VIDEOSTREAMING
CELLPHONE at some CUTE GIRLS instead. We can see their faces
on the tiny SCREEN of the cellphone.
Ryan's car gets caught behind a blue speedster, then passes
on the shoulder.RYANMove, bitch.
He gets an EXTENDED PLAY and the screen flashes "NEW RECORD."
Nearby, a KID watching the game nods.KIDNice.
The HIGH SCORE starts rising to match Ryan's score.RYANGet that?
Ryan turns around to see Chad has shoved the cellphone down
the front of his tattered shorts. And he's freeballing it.CHADCheck it; Attack of the Bubblegum
            Monster in Hi-Def videostream-RYANC'mon Chad, I gotta put my mouth on
            that.
Holding a cup of soda between his teeth, Chad pulls the
cellphone out of his pants and hits "SEND".CHAD(through cup-holding
                  teeth)
            Sweet. It's going to my email
            right now.
S9me soda inadvertently SPILLS onto the cellphone and Chad
wipes it dry on his pants.RYANWatch it dude, I gotta return that
            thing in seven days.CHADThey aren't giving you shit yet?RYANNah, whenever I return it, I just
            list off why the phone sucks and
            they give me a new model. Figure
            by the tenth time I'll have to go
            somewhere else.
Ryan's car finally CRASHES in a wall of flames.       Game Over.CUT TO:THE OCEANAs seen looking over the rail of the pier.      The tide is in,
but it's still a forty foot drop.RYAN stares over the railing like a death row inmate
contemplating his last meal.CHADGo already. No one's looking.
His left hand holds his WALLET.CHAD (CONT'D)(re: wallet)
           Need me to hold that?
Ryan sticks it in the pocket of his surfer shorts -- he zips
a zipper, tucks a Velcro flap. Pats his pocket proudly.RYANWaterproof.
But as soon as Ryan covertly CLIMBS ONTO THE RAIL, his left
leg starts trembling like crazy.RYAN (CONT'D)This is stupid. I could get
          killed. Pick another dare.
Chad lowers the phone, irritated.CHADMy ass. Not after you made me
          march in the Gay Pride Parade
          wearing a thong.RYANScrew it then. In one... Two...
          Two and a half--CHADWhole numbers only, Rabbitfoot.
Ryan stares at the waves crashing below. His leg starts
snaking like crazy... And he chickens out, hopping back to
the deck.CHAD (CONT'D)Just so you know, I'm emailing this
          to every chick you ever met.
But suddenly Ryan's oblivious to the dare.   His eyes are
glued to something else--CHAD (CONT'D)(speaking like HAL 900)
          Transmitting pussy file now.
CHLOE, early 20s, a head turner, confident, funny; she can
pull you in like a tractor beam. She and some CUTE FRIENDS
carry heavy cardboard boxes toward a table set up for the
"Heal The Bay" rally.
Ryan walks over like he owns the place.RYANGot any more? I'm here to help.CHLOEThanks, but no, we got 'em all.RYANWhat's in 'em?
Chloe opens the box.    Hands him a "Heal The Bay" pamphlet.RYAN (CONT'D)Cool, you're handing these out
           during the concert?CHLOEYeah, wanna help?
Ryan tries to ignore his thundering heart.RYANHell yeah.     I'm all about "Heal the
          Bay. "
His eyes ricochet off the pamphlet in his hand.RYAN (CONT'D)Me an Chad do the monthly cleanup
          thing, of course...
An awesome wing-man, Chad appears over Chloe's shoulder,
pretending to read a pamphlet, but really holding it up so
Ryan can see it. Piece of cake, now.RYAN (CONT'D)We've collected water samples with
          the Stream Team, raised money on
          the Promenade... I'm surprised I
          haven't seen you.
He offers his hand.RYAN (CONT'D)Ryan.
She takes it.CHLOEChloe.
The handshake lingers a second longer than necessary, and
they both smile at each other. Chad splits.CHLOE (CONT'D)I can't tell if you're full of it.
Ryan stops posturing, gets real.RYANYou ever go up to Santa Barbara?
          My dad used to take me there allRYAN (CONT'D)the time. Their pier is amazing,
           clear water, huge crabs everywhere,
           oysters right there on the rocks,
           starfish... Hard to believe it's
           the same ocean sometimes.
He's managed to win her back.CHLOEMaybe you and I can take a break
           later when Pat Benatar goes on.RYANSounds like a plan.
There's a moment...     Then --CHLOEOh no -- I forgot. I still have to
          pick up a box of T-shirts at the
          Kinkos on Venice.RYANI'll do it for you... if you want.CHLOESeriously, you would?RYANSure.     How much is the bill?CHLOENothing.    It's been paid up front.RYANDo you promise not to go anywhere?CHLOEDone.
Ryan makes a graceful exit.       Turns back.RYANOkay, I won't be long.CHLOE(laughing)
          Bye.
Ryan grabs Chad, and as they walk out of earshot:RYANDude, does Santa Barbara have a
          harbor or a pier?CUT TO:EXT. VENICE - DAYA short time later, Ryan cruises through a Venice
neighborhood.Ryan drives an early 70's Ford Bronco; clothes are strewn
across the backseat, and a box of "Heal the Bay" T-SHIRTS now
sits on the shotgun seat.
Ryan reaches into the glove box and pulls out a toothbrush.
He sips warm soda from a bottle and begins brushing.
Checking himself out in the mirror, he sniffs his pits, whoa,
and grabs the cellphone.RYAN(into phone)
           Dex, wassup? You won't believe the
           hotties I just met at the pier.
           Smoking. You wanna meet them?
           Yeah? Well don't get too excited
           'cause I need my money.
Ryan stops at a red light.RYAN (CONT'D)Bullshit, you're not going
           anywhere,
                (quickly adding)
           I'm pulling up right now.
Some AMBULANCES SPEED BY, SIRENS BLARING.   It's deafening.
Ryan lays on the horn.   When the light changes, Ryan peels
away angrily.RYAN (CONT'D)(covering his ear)
          What? Yeah, you better be. And I
          need your shower, I'm talkin' code
          red stankage-
The CELLPHONE begins to CRACKLE with STATIC just as Ryan
drives under an OVERPASS.
Suddenly --
The car ahead of him STOPS in the middle of the street. Ryan
notices too late and has to jam on the brakes. The car
skids, he SCREAMS... and comes to a stop an inch before
hitting the other car's bumper.
He lifts the phone receiver to his ear but the call is WASHEDWITH STATIC.RYAN (CONT'D)(into phone)
          Dex? You still there...?
And as has happened to all of us, he loses the call.RYAN (CONT'D)Damn.EXT. HIGHWAY OVERPASS - MOMENTS LATER                           10As traffic resumes and Ryan clears the overpass--ID                                                                   iuSFX:   THE CELLPHONE RINGS.Ryan picks up the phone.RYANSorry, got cut off.

     simulate a NUMERIC PULSE that she almost doesn't hear:RYAN (VO)Hello...?
     Jessica's hands go suddenly still, then -- WHOOM! -- her head
     slams down INTO FRAME on top of the crushed earpiece, a
     desperate hope filling her eyes.CUT BACK TO:13   INT. FORD BRONCO - CONTINUOUS                                   13With still no answer, Ryan pulls the phone from his ear --RYANWhatever.    Signing off-
     -- and is just about to hit END CALL when he hears a tiny
     female voice on the other end.JESSICA (VO)Wait!    Don't hang up!
     Ryan puts the phone back to his ear.RYANHello?JESSICA (VO)There's not much time! I need you

     Jessica's voice TREMBLES uncontrollably.        Desperate, fearful
     and frustrated.JESSICA (VO)No!   You don't understand!
     Suddenly, the cellphone BLIPS twice in Ryan's ear.          He pulls
     it away and looks at its faceplate.14   INSERT SHOT - THE CELLPHONE                                            14The LCD reads:     CALL WAITING.   ACCEPT?15   EXT. SURFACE STREETS - DAY                                             15RYANIf you were really in trouble, you

     The Woman smiles and nods, and Mooney walks off. When he
     gets to his car, he CRUMPLES the paper with Jessica's name
     and address, and shakes his head, chuckling at himself.
