          "And there came a day, a day unlike any other, when Earth's
          mightiest heroes and heroines found themselves united against a
          common threat. On that day, the Avengers were born--to fight the
          foes no single superhero could withstand! Through the years,
          their roster has prospered, changing many times, but their glory
          has never been denied! Heed the call, then--for now, the Avengers
          Assemble!"

          state of panic. It's an evacuation. A SWOOPING helicopter flies
          in.

          CHAOS. Men in suits run around like in the typical `we have to
          leave' fashion. Soldiers on foot jump onto Humvees, accelerating
          the hell out of there. A VOICE bellows from hidden loudspeakers.EXT. HELICOPTER PAD � CONTINUOUSStanding a few yards from the landing pad, A Fed in a suit with
          badass shades, peers at the helicopter as it lands. This isSHIELD AGENT PHIL COULSON.Walking out of the helicopter is SHIELD AGENT MARIA HILL, SEXY,
          FIERCE AND DETERMINED. Following her, SHIELD DIRECTOR NICK FURY
          climbs out. Hill and Fury approach Agent Coulson.NICK FURYHow bad is it?AGENT PHIL COULSONThat's the problem, sir. We don't know.INT. FACILITY FLOOR � NIGHTAgent Coulson leads Hill and Fury through the radiation section
          of the facility. Hundreds of technicians and other staff run

           distance.NICK FURYI need you to make sure that PHASE 2
           prototypes are shipped out.AGENT MARIA HILLSir, is that really a priority right

           With me.INT. NASA SPACE RADIATION FACILITY, VACUUM CHAMBER � CONTINUOUSFury enters the lab facility where the Tesseract is being held
          by a COMPACT MUON SOLENOID COIL CHAMBER.NICK FURYTalk to me, doctor.
          DR. ERIK SELVIG emerges from behind the CMS machine, concerned.
          The Tesseract is glowing unusually brighter and flare rings
          shoot out at random.SELVIGDirector.NICK FURYIs there anything we know for certain?SELVIGTesseract is misbehaving.NICK FURYIs that supposed to be funny?SELVIGNo, it's not funny at all. The
           Tesseract is not only active,
           she's...misbehaving.NICK FURYHow soon until you pull the plug?SELVIGShe's an energy source. If we turn off
           the power, she turns it back on. If she
           reaches peak level...NICK FURYWe've prepared for this, doctor.
           Harnessing energy from space.SELVIGWe don't have the harness. Our
           calculations are far from complete. Now
           she's throwing off interference,
           radiation. Nothing harmful, low levels
           of gamma radiation.NICK FURYThat can be harmful. Where's Barton?SELVIGThe Hawk? Up in his nest, as usual.
          We see CLINT BARTON, dressed in black tactical gear, is up on
          the railings watching them below, Fury calls Barton on his
          earpiece.NICK FURYAgent Barton, report.
          BARTON rappels down from the catwalk. Walks up to Fury. They
          both walk around the facility in a discreet manner.NICK FURYI gave you this detail so you could
           keep a close eye on things.CLINT BARTONWell, I see better from a distance.NICK FURYAre you seeing anything that might set
           this thing off?NASA SCIENTIST(TO SELVIG)Doctor, it's spiking again.CLINT BARTONNo one's come or gone. It's oven is
           clean. No contacts, no I.M.'s. If there
           was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at
           this end.NICK FURYAt this end?CLINT BARTONYeah, the cube is a doorway to the
           other end of space, right? The doors
           open from both sides.
          DR. SELVIG clacks away at the keyboard and sees on the
          monitoring his worst nightmares. Suddenly- the Tesseract
          THUNDERS and SHAKES the entire facility. Big enough where both
          Agents Hill and Coulson can feel and they're at different ends
          of the facility.
          The flaring rings and glow of the cube spout out brighter and
          louder, like a boiling pot of water. The Tesseract's energy
          builds up into a BEAM much like the Bifrost Bridge, which HITS
          at the end of a platform that is wired to the CMS device. The
          great maelstrom beam FIRES the TESSERACT energy. The beam then
          forms a VORTEX, which then opens up a PORTAL.
          A BLACK HOLE IS CREATED. From the portal, the blackness of
          SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn with a billion stars
          appears and a GUST of BLUE ENERGY CLOUDS fill the room, blinding
          everyone.
          The Tesseract's energy forms into a cloud that reaches to the
          top the facility's vacuum chamber ceiling. It's abnormally
          quiet. Then... HEAVY BREATHING is heard from the platform.
          SHIELD GUARDS slowly approach, weapons in hands. A figure is
          kneeling on the platform, smoke coming off it. It's LOKI.
          Smiling in his mischievous manner, he raises his head. The smile
          dies down. He looks deep into the eyes of Fury, Barton and
          Selvig. He stands up, holing the scepter.NICK FURYSir, please put down the spear!
          Loki looks at his spear then suddenly points it at where Fury
          and Barton are standing and SHOOTS OUT A BLUE EXPLODING LIGHT
          TOWARDS THEM. BARTON TACKLES Fury and they both barely miss
          Loki's fired shot.
          ALL HELL BREAKS. Machine gun fire is shot at Loki, but the
          bullets bounce off him like a boss. Loki jumps high from the
          platform and ATTACKS those firing at him.
          In the blink of an eye, Loki takes down several guards with his
          KNIVES and ENERGY BLASTS from the scepter. He stops and waits to
          see who will attack him next. Honestly, the whole lab has almost
          gone to shit.
          Barton tries to stand up. Loki quickly walks towards him. Barton
          raises his gun, but Loki grabs Barton's hand.LOKIYou have heart.
          Loki points the head of his spear at Barton's head. Barton's
          eyes suddenly glow BLACK. The ability to control Barton's mind
          is now in Loki's hand. Barton puts his piece away and stands
          straight.
          As Loki is busy using his abilities to control the minds of
          several S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel, Fury takes the Tesseract,
          placing it back into its case and tries to leave the lab.Then...LOKIPlease don't. I still need that.NICK FURY(TURNING)This doesn't have to get any messier.LOKIOf course it does. I've come too far
           for anything else. I am Loki of Asgard,
           and I am burdened with glorious
           purpose.SELVIGLoki? Brother of Thor?NICK FURYWe have no quarrel with your people.LOKIAn ant has no quarrel with a boot.NICK FURYYou planning to step on us?LOKII come with glad tidings, of a world
           made free.NICK FURYFree from what?LOKIFreedom. Freedom is life's great lie.
           Once you accept that, in your heart...
          Like a gunslinger, Loki turns to face Selvig who's
          standingbehind him and places his spear against Selvig's heart.
          Selvig's eyes glow BLACK.LOKIYou will know peace.NICK FURYYeah, you say peace, I kind of think
           you mean the other thing.
          From the vacuum chamber ceiling, Tesseract's energy cloud
          RAPIDLY builds into what may be an implosion.CLINT BARTONSir, Director Fury is stalling. This
           place is about to blow. Drop a hundred
           feet of rock on us. He means to bury
           us.NICK FURYLike The Pharaohs of Odin.SELVIGHe's right. The portal is collapsing in
           on itself. You got maybe two minutes
           before this goes critical.LOKIWell, then...
          Loki, looking at Barton, who doesn't even hesitate, SHOOTS FURY
          WHO FALLS TO THE GROUND. Barton grabs the case containing the
          Tesseract and leaves the lab with Loki, Selvig and the other
          S.H.I.E.L.D personnel Loki is controlling.INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER, ENTRANCE OF EXITING TUNNEL � NIGHTLoki, Barton, Selvig and the other S.H.I.E.L.D personnel are in
          the parking lot of the facility, quickly gathering certain
          weapons. Agent Hill watches in confusion, referring to Loki.CLINT BARTON(pointing to the Loki team)
           Need these vehicles.AGENT MARIA HILLWho's that?CLINT BARTONHe didn't tell me.
          Agent Hill looks suspiciously at them as they get into the truck
          and turns to leave, as she's walking away...NICK FURY(through the walkie talkie)
           Hill, do you copy?!

          shooting.BACK AT THE LABFury is holding his side, running.NICK FURYHe's got the Tesseract! Track it down!

          truck.Loki's trucks SCREECH across the tunnel. Several SHIELD
          trucks pull up to them. A drive-by shooting ensues.
          Loki, who stands on top of the bed of the truck, uses his
          scepter and EMITS energy blasts, flipping over SHIELD trucks.
          They get in, the cars roar out after them. Agent Hill puts
          herself at a distance.INT. FACILITY FLOOR � NIGHTFury races out of the hallway, avoiding falling pipes. The
          entire facility is now in a full earthquake.INT. FACILITY FLOOR, ELSEWHERE � CONTINUOUSAgent Coulson and several SHIELD agents fall down the steps,

          They run out of there like a bat from hell.INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL � NIGHTAgent Hill's JEEP ROARS out of a side of Barton's truck and
          pulls up alongside them on the left. She goes way ahead and
          pulls her brake, swerving into a 360, facing Barton's truck and
          driving in reverse.
          Barton's ARMS reach out the open window and OPENS FIRE. Agent
          Hill figures `fuck it' and SHOOTS her windshield OPENING FIRE on
          Barton.EXT. VAN � NIGHTAgent Coulson jumps into a SHIELD VAN. On his walkie:AGENT PHIL COULSONYou're clear, sir! You need to go!EXT. HELICOPTER PAD � CONTINUOUSFury BOLTS out of the facility and jumps into a helicopter. The
          surface of the pad gives way, PLUNGING the helicopter through
          the surface. But Fury's chopper BARELY makes it out.INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL � NIGHTStill in a chase and drive-by sequence, Barton's pushes the
          pedal harder, which causes Agent Hill's JEEP to WOBBLE out and
          put her back behind.INT. RADIATION FACILITY, VACUUM CHAMBER � NIGHTThe Tesseract's energy cloud now SHRINKS into a SMALL BALL OF
          WHITE LIGHT. Then...A CLOUD OF BLUE LIGHT CONSUMES THE ENTIRE FACILITY AND PARTS OFTHE DESERT. Fury watches from below, a RAPID build-up into what
          may be an implosion. Several miles away, Agent Coulson's van
          feels a JOLT of the Tesseract's BLASTWAVE. THE ENTIRE FACILITYSWALLOWS INTO ITSELF-- A TERRIFYING, UNIMAGINABLE IMPLOSION.INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL � NIGHTThe BLASTWAVE of the Tesseract causes the tunnel to cave it.
          Like an ocean wave, blinding crumbles of falling rock, fall onto
          Agent Hill's JEEP, leaving her NEARLY trapped under this blanket
          of rock.
          On the Barton's truck, they escape the tunnel and drive into the
          desert landscape. Fury's helicopter ROARS over Barton's truck.
          Loki looks up.
          From the chopper's door, it slides open and Fury stands there,
          holding a gun, SHOOTING at Barton's, giving an honoring image ofJULES WINNFIELD.Loki looks at Fury and in a fit of RAGE, points his scepter
          SHOOTS OUT THE BLUE LIGHT. The chopper CATCHES on fire, GOING
          DOWN in a FIERY BALL. Fury, like the boss he is, JUMPS OUT and
          touches down onto the desert floor. The chopper BARRELS along
          the ground.
          Fury, coming back to his senses, FIRES at Loki, but they're
          toofar and too late. Loki looks back, smiling. Fury stands
          there, MIND REELING. Then...AGENT PHIL COULSON(WALKIE TALKIE)Director? Director Fury, do you copy?NICK FURYThe Tesseract is with the hostile
           force. I have men down. Hill?INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL � NIGHTAgent Hill climbs out her JEEP, which is sandwiched in, but

           LEVEL SEVEN. As of right now, we are at
           war.
          A beat.AGENT PHIL COULSON(WALKIE TALKIE)What do we do?
          Fury stands there. Thinking. He looks up. On his face is sign of
          hope.THE AVENGERSEXT. RUSSIA, SOLENSKI PLAZA, 3RD FLOOR � NIGHTOut in the outskirts, near a railroad, a still in construction
          building is being occupied by GEORGI LUCHKOV, a LARGE, RUSSIAN
          GENERAL along with his THUGS.
          TALL THUG is in the middle of a brutal beating on NATASHA
          ROMANOFF, a SLEWING, FOXY, UNBELIEVABLY SEXY SPY. He BACKHANDS
          NATASHA'S face. She feels the pain, but does not breakdown.
          LUCHKOV, smiling, walks up to her. Dialogue is in RUSSIAN.LUCHKOVThis is not how I wanted the evening to
           go.NATASHAI know how you wanted this evening to
           go. Believe me, this is better.LUCHKOVI'd like to know why they sent you to
           carry out a carrier, a stained glass
           and other random items.
          TALL THUG rocks her chair back, balancing her off the edge of an
          open floor. Natasha is now scared.NATASHAI thought General Soholob was in charge
           of the export business.LUCHKOVSoholob? Your reputation is quite a
           progression. THE FAMOUS BLACK WIDOW.
           Nothing but a pretty face.NATASHAYou really think I'm pretty?
          LUCHKOV slowly walks over to a table filled with tools. He picks
          up a pair of pliers. TALL THUG opens up her mouth wide open.LUCHKOVWe do not need the Lermontov to
           transfer the tanks. Tell him, well,...(IN ENGLISH)You may have to write it down.
          Suddenly, WEASELLY THUG'S cell rings. Confused, he answers.WEASELLY THUGYa?
           (looks at LUCHKOV)
           It's for you.
          LUCHKOV takes the phone, pissed.LUCHKOVWho the hell is...AGENT PHIL COULSONYou're at 114 Solenski Plaza, 3rd floor.
           We have an F22 exactly 8 miles out. Put
           the woman on the phone or I will blow
           up the block before you can make the
           lobby.
          HOLY SHIT. LUCHKOV places the cell phone against Natasha's ear
          seeing how she's tied to a chair with her hands tied behind her
          back.AGENT PHIL COULSONWe need you to come in.NATASHAAre you kidding? I'm working!AGENT PHIL COULSONThis takes precedence.NATASHAI'm in the middle of an interrogation
           and this moron is giving me everything.LUCHKOVI don't give everything.
          Natasha gives him a look.NATASHALook, you can't pull me out of this
           right now.AGENT PHIL COULSONNatasha. Barton's been compromised.
          A beat.NATASHALet me put you on hold.
          She nods to LUCHKOV. As Luchkov comes to take the phone off her,
          Natasha HITS him with her leg and HEADBUUTS him. Like a spider,
          she stands up elegantly and starts ATTACKING TALL THUG by
          KICKBOXING him in the face.
          Still tied, she ROLLS over WEASELLY THUG after she trips him.
          She then STOMPS on TALL THUG foot with peg of the chair, thenKNOCKS HIM OUT WITH HER HEAD.Yeah, during all this Coulson is still waiting on the line. She
          then FLIPS over and FALLS down hard on WEASELLY THUG, BREAKING
          THE CHAIR. She sees TALL THUG stand.
          Giving her momentum, she runs at him DROP KICKING him, FALLS
          DOWN and FLIPS right back up and WRAPS HER LEGS AROUND HIS NECKAND KNOCKS HIM OUT COLD.She grabs LUCHKOV, wraps his leg around with a hanging chain and
          drops him down the open floor, dangling. She picks up the phone
          and her heels, like a boss.NATASHAWhere's Barton now?AGENT PHIL COULSONWe don't know.NATASHABut he's alive.AGENT PHIL COULSONWe think so. I'll brief you on

          THE MIGHTY THOR. Thor OPENS the ramp and grabs Loki by the

          the side of the mountain. He raises the mighty hammer, MJ�LNIR.

          angry to see him alive in this fashion.THORWhere is the Tesseract?LOKI(LAUGHS)I missed you too.THORDo I look to be in a gaming mood?!LOKIOh, you should thank me. With the
           Bifrost gone how much dark energy did

          Thor drops MJ�LNIR, causing the mountain to quake. He picks up
          Loki. His brother.

          From the mountain side, Loki watches in amusement. Thor raises
          his hand. Mj�lnir flies back to his hand. Thor SWINGS the
          hammer, summoning a ray of energy.
          IRON MAN stands up and from his HAND BOOSTERS, a BLAST of ENERGY
          KNOCKS the MIGHTY AVENGER on his ass. IRON MAN flies back up and
          knocks Thor into a tree. Right back at you, bitch!
          Thor, kneeling on the ground, pulls Mj�lnir to his hand, raises
          it to the skies and pulls in LIGHTING and THUNDER! Thor points

          much energy as he can and SHOOTS ENERGY in Thor's face.
          Thor FALLS back, losing his stance. IRON MAN HEADBUTTS Thor,
          with his gold-titanium alloy helmet. Thor... HEADBUTTS him with

          arm and cape and SWINGS him into another tree. Thor looks up,

          SWINGS and MISSES, giving Thor the momentum to grab him, lift
          him and SMASH him down hard.
          Thor summons back Mj�lnir to his hand. Just as he's about to put
          the hammer down, IRON MAN uses his HAND BOOSTERS to SKID across
          the ground and trip Thor over. Standing up, Thor looks for him,

           You're work on anti-electron collisions
           is unparalleled. And I'm a huge fan of
           the way you lose control and turn into
           an enormous green rage monster.BANNER(LOOKS DOWN)Thanks.NICK FURY(WALKING IN)Dr. Banner is only here to track the
           cube. I was hoping you might join him.STEVELet's start with that stick of his. It
           may be magical, but it works an awful
           lot like a HYDRA weapon.NICK FURYI don't know about that, but it is
           powered by the cube. And I'd like to
           know how Loki used it to turn two of
           the sharpest men I know into his
           personal flying monkeys.THORMonkeys? I do not understand.STEVEI do! I understood that reference.
          Tony rolls his eyes, while Cap looks proud of himself.TONYShall we play, doctor?BANNERLet's play some.

          algorithms and equations.BANNERThe gamma readings are definitely
           consistent with Selvig's reports on the
           Tesseract. But it's gonna take weeks to
           process.TONYIf we bypass their mainframe and direct
           a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can
           clock this around six hundred
           teraflops.BANNERAll I packed was a tooth brush.TONY(SMILES)You know, you should come by STARK
           TOWERS sometime. Top ten floors, all

          So, why didn't SHIELD bring him in on

          out.
          The ROAR gets LOUDER and CLOSER. Thor focuses. His hand strains
          toward mid-air. His eyes tight in concentration. The HULK runs
          right at him. At the last second, MJ�LNIR flies into his hand
          and Thor UPPERCUTS HULK, WHO CRASHES INTO A FIGHTER JET.
          HULK stands up, shaking his head like `what the fuck just

          Struggle as he may, HULK wraps his hand around the hammer. The
          hammer doesn't move. To no avail -- he strains with all his
          might, SCREAMS from the effort, BELLOWING.
          Thor jumps up again, KNEEING HULK in the face. Thor grabs his

           Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you.
           Lost my one good eye. Maybe I had that
           coming.(A BEAT)Yes, we were going to build an arsenal
           with the Tesseract. I never put all my
           chips on that number though, because I
           was playing something even riskier.
           There was an idea, Stark knows this,
           called THE AVENGERS INITIATIVE. The
           idea was to bring together a group of
           remarkable people, see if they could
           become something more. See if they
           could work together when we needed them
           to, to fight the battles that we never
           could. Phil Coulson died still
           believing in that idea, in heroes.
