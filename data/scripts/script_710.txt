April 30, 1975PLEASE NOTE THE CRYSTAL WILL BE USED IN THELEFT HAND OF ALL CHARACTERS.FADE IN:BEFORE AND DURING  TITLES1		EXT. - SKY NIGHTThe moon and stars are visible, but as CAMERA looks down, the SCREEN
fills with dark, billowing clouds. CAMERA moves into the clouds and
just  as they blank out the SCREEN, a distant shimmer of light
becomes visible.  Moving toward it, the shimmer becomes2		EXT. - DOME OF GLASS - NIGHTA glowing but not transparent structure stretching off into the
clouds  that press it. CAMERA continues to move in until the
detailed structural  webbing of the dome fills the SCREEN and then
CAMERA MOVES THROUGH IT and  we see3		EXT. - THE CITY - DAYShining below the dome (which we now see as a series of dome-like
structures standing off without end) -a marvelous crystalline city
of  great openness, building clusters, green plazas, fountains...
multi-leveled  but human scale, crisscrossed by the flickering clear
tubes of the MAZE- CARS.4		CLOSER ANGLE - ROOFTOPSAs a MAZE-CAR slides softly to a stop.5		ROOFTOP - THE RUNNERThe hatch opens and a MAN in a hurry leaves the maze-car and runs
swiftly  along the rooftop and disappears into an open elevator
which instantly  starts to descend.6		INT - RESIDENCE PLAZA - THE ELEVATORFrom a busy courtyard below we watch the elevator slide down from a
great  height.  As it reaches the courtyard the RUNNER darts out,
pushes into  the crowd.7 		OUT8		WITH THE RUNNERAs he reappears around a corner, skirts a brimming pool and makes
for a  kind of broad corridor which seems to lead out of the
courtyard. He is  moving even faster now, glancing back as if he
fears pursuit.9		ANOTHER ANGLE - CORRIDORAbove, at the railing of an oval light well, dressed in black and
silver,   a figure holding an odd looking weapon lazily in one hand
-- and watching.  It is FRANCIS.10		WITH THE RUNNERMoving rapidly down the corridor, he suddenly stops as if feeling
the  presence above. He looks up, sees the SANDMAN and his face
breaks in  terror. He wheels, frantic, screaming, runs back into the
hall.11		THE SANDMAN (FRANCIS)Vaulting the rail, dropping lightly to ground level, weapon poised.12		P.O.V.The crowd melting, parting to reveal the Runner backed against the
pool.  People are YELLING, shaking their fists, terribly excited and
fearful.13		THE SANDMANEmotionless. Aims. Fires.14		THE RUNNER - CLOSESeeming to burst aflame in the LENS, then slipping BELOW FRAME to
reveal  Francis sauntering forward, holstering his weapon. The crowd
closing in  behind him, applauding, congratulating him.15		THE SANDMANArriving at the pool where the body lies, half immersed. He leans
over,  lifts the right hand from the water, revealing a palm with a
black  flowercrystal shape in it. He lets the hand fall back now as
the crowd   CHEERS and APPLAUDS him.16		EXTREME CLOSE UP - HAND - IN THE WATER - (INSERT)Closing in until the crystal fills the SCREEN.MATCH DISSOLVE TO:(TITLES END)17		CLOSE UP - CRYSTAL - (INSERT)Clear, sparkling, flower-like. CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal18		INT. - NURSERY CORRIDORThe crystal is in the hand of a sleeping INFANT who is behind glass
in  one of many cubicles. Standing outside, looking in, LOGAN, dimly
lit in   the soft glow of the cubicle where the sleeping infant
lies, swaddled and  coccooned in the rosy auto-tender which caters
to the baby's every need.  Faint MUSIC bubbles like distant
laughter.19		OUT19X1		LOGANLogan is twenty-five, strong, virile (yet sensitive) with a kind of
austere grace.

He is somewhat manic...proud...as he peers through the nursery
window  into a kind of foam cocoon which cradles THREE SLEEPING
INFANTS. Logan is  KNOCKING on the soundless glass.LOGANWake up...come on, Logan-6.19X2		FRANCISentering .

						FRANCIS  (shaking	
    					his head in  mild, mocking
	    				disbelief)	
			You are here. I  couldn't 
			believe it when they told me.  
			What are you doing?LOGAN (still knocking  
	    				on the soundless glass)  
			Turn this way. 
	    				(as one of the infants 
	   				stirs, smiles, bubbles) 
			No,  no...not you...YOU!Francis tries to pull Logan away from the  window, but Logan is
intent on waking one of  the infants.FRANCISYou should've seen me take my  
			last Runner...perfect. 
	    				(Logan  continues to pound the  
	     			soundless glass) 
			I backed him  up against a residence 
			pool and  when he terminated...his  
			hand... 
	    				(breaks off as Logan
	    				is paying  no attention)
			So now you've seen him...what's
			the difference awake or asleep?

						LOGAN (to infant)   
			Open your eyes once, idiot.  
					(to Francis) 
			It's not every  day that a Sandman 
			son is  born. I'm telling you, 
			Francis  - that's him!FRANCISMaybe,  maybe not. What's the  
			difference? Come on,  Logan, 
			let's get out of  here before 
			everybody  finds out.

But Logan isn't moving. Francis gets an  idea.FRANCISOkay...you really want to wake 
			him up?

Francis starts to pry at the Panel...knowing it  will sound anALARM.LOGANHey, cut that out !

Too late: There is a SOUND OF ALARM CHIMES. The area in which they
stand  is bathed in a violet glow. Logan grabs Francis firmly and
stops him from  prying at the panel:LOGANNow you've done it...

The CHIMES STOP...but the glow continues, a metallic VOICE is heard:VOICEBreak-in scanners report intrusion, 
			identify.LOGANLogan-5...Francis-7, authorized duty
			quadrant. Intrusion accidental.VOICEClear Logan-5 and Francis-7.

The violet light goes off.


						FRANCIS (with affection:
					to Logan) 
			Had enough?

						LOGAN (looking at the infant)
			Even the alarm didn't wake him.

As Francis starts out:

						LOGAN (one last look; 
					joining Francis)
			All right, Francis...I'm with you.

They move off down the corridor...the lights behind them DIMMING as
they  pass cubicles suffused with soft pink light, CHILDREN
automatically  tended.

CHIMES...soft. A lullaby and a soothing impersonal VOICE.VOICESleep time...go to sleep.
			Sleeping time, little ones.

As they exit Nursery...Logan stops and takes one final look
backward.FRANCISYou need a lift. Let's go 
			to Arcade and celebrate...
					(teasing tone)
			your alert successor...Logan-6.LOGANHas anyone ever broken in to 
			where the babies are?FRANCIS(putting a card key into a door 
					which opens soundlessly) 
			Not in my time...

They move through the door which closes.20		EXT. - MAZE STATION - NIGHTThey are now on a kind of enclosed platform with widely spaced
doorways,  each glowing faintly. They pause, waiting.




						FRANCIS (peering 
					at Logan curiously)
			Why?LOGANjust wondered...what happens?

						FRANCIS (shrugs) 
			Dunno...flameout maybe. Whatever 
			happens, you can bet it's final. 
			But who would want to find out?

One of the doorways brightens and the word ARCADE _ appears on it.
The  two men move to the spot as a maze-car stops. They enter it
through the  doorway which dims behind them as the maze-car WHOOSHES
softly off into a  kind of twilight.21		INT. - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND FRANCISThe door slides shut. They sink into seat forms which yield to them.
They   move off.22		EXT. - MAZE- CARMoving through the city at terrific speed. Giving us glimpses of the
city  as it goes. slowing finally as we see:23		THE CITY - FEATURING ARCADEBrightly lit, garish. We get only a glimpse as the maze-car
disappears  into a tunnel.24		MAZE-CAR STATION - ARCADEAs the maze-car stops, opens and Logan and Francis exit into   a
gathering  CROWD.25		FULL SHOT - ARCADEGlittering, crowded. Throngs of people moving on many levels, some
walking, some on moving platforms. It's The Great White Way, Luna
Park --  you name it. Gaudy booths and entrances, featuring every
delight -- too  much to take in at a glance.26		WITH LOGAN AND FRANCISAs they thread their way through a crowd which admires them when it
notices them, across halls and up moving platforms, the good-natured
argument continuing...LOGANbut you don't know, you Just 
			say what everyone says.  One for 
			one. One for one."FRANCISWell, why no!? That's exactly how
			everything works. How else could 
			the city stay in balance -You have
			a better idea?LOGAN (laughs)
			No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- 
			instead of doing that "one for one" song 		
			of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher 
			With a stuck tape.FRANCISWell the minute you get a better
			idea you can stop wondering.
					(beat)
			You know, Logan -- you wonder 
			a lot. Too much for a Sandman

They are passing the facade of a Relive Shop The signs urging people
to:  RELIVE YOUR MOST PRECIOUS MEMORIES. DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN!REFRESH AND  RENEW ANYTIME!!As they cross the entrance, two men come out, grinning broadly,
falling  into step just ahead of Logan and Francis. Then one of the
men stops  abruptly, almost colliding with them. He mumbles an
apology and starts  back to RELIVE.

As he disappears into the RELIVE SHOP, his friend shrugs cheerfully
to  Logan and Francis and moves on.27		ARCADE - ANOTHER ANGLE - NEW YOUThey are moving past a shop called NEW YOU #483 when a man comes
cannonading out, thrilled and excited. He rushes over to a pretty
young  woman who has been eying Logan and Francis, plants himself in
front of  her with his hands framing his face.MANWell? How do you like it?

						WOMAN (critically) 
			I don't know. The cheeks maybe...
			look a little -MANCheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, 
			you think?WOMANToo little.MANToo little?
					(gestures)
			Too little. Okay, wait for me.

And he darts back into NEW YOU #483. The woman shrugs, glances
around,  smiles and goes off with a passer-by.28		ARCADE - ANOTHER ANGLE - LOVE SHOPSigns promising LOVE, FULFILLMENT, RARE DELIGHTS. People streaming
in and  out. A woman comes out looking glazed, breathing
"yes...yes..." As she  passes CAMERA Logan and Francis emerge from
the crowd and CAMERA moves  with them.LOGANDid you ever see Francis-8?

						FRANCIS (shaking his head) 
			I never even visited Nursery before 
			tonight. 
					(beat) 
			When you wonder, it slows you up --
			you know?

They are now passing the facade of HALLUCIMILL where the signs
promise:  LIFT OFF, CRAZY LIFT, SUPER LIFT...here the people going
in are simply  excited but the ones coming out are clearly stoned
out of their minds...FRANCISI don't know what makes you so curious. 
			You have any idea who his seed-mother was?

						LOGAN (quickly) 
			Of course not! I m curious, not sick.
					(laughs)

The crowd is growing denser, funneling into a kind of passageway.
Logan  and Francis are swallowed up in the group.29		FULL SHOT - ARCADE GREAT HALLAn immense room into which the streams of people coming from the
entertainment area are mingling. There is a general air of
anticipation  stirring the crowd as CAMERA singles out Logan and
Francis entering,  waving to friends. CAMERA closes in on them just
as they reach a  beautiful woman who is obviously pleased to see
Francis. They embrace,  and as they break:FRANCISand that's my friend, Logan. 
					(as she acknowledges 
					the introduction)
			We're celebrating his next in line.
			Carousel - Arcade - who knows? 
			Want to come along?

						WOMAN (smiles, shakes her head)
			Only if I make it to the top of
			Carousel.
					(she holds up her hand)
			Thirty -- and the big spin.

In her palm the crystal blinks, red, black. Francis nods, gives her
a  half-squeeze.FRANCISYou're thirty -- already? I always 
			thought I was older than you - 
					(beat)
			Well, give it a good try.

						WOMAN (pleasantly) 
			You know I always have.

Another beautiful WOMAN joins them.

						2ND WOMAN (to the first) 
			Sorry I won't be at Carousel tonight. 
			It�s  my Love-Shop turn.WOMANThat's all right. Happy turn.2ND WOMANYou'll renew. I've got a feeling.

 						WOMAN (smiles) 
			So do I...but if I don't at least I'll 
			have the ultimate thrill. I'd almost 
			rather have that than renew.2ND WOMANI feel the same way. Sometimes I think 
			I'm not even going to try and renew when 
			my time comes. But -- that's three years away.
			So long.

The 2nd Woman walks away.

						FRANCIS (after a beat; 
					to first Woman) 
 			It's been nice.WOMANUm-huh.

They look briefly and then she turns away. Francis takes Logan's arm
and  they move off.FRANCISI guess you never had her?

Logan shakes his head.FRANCISYou missed something special.LOGANWell...you can't have them all.LOGAN AND FRANCIS(together, it's an old joke)
 			But you can try.

They laugh, but the laughter is broken as a trio of youngsters,
moving  with erratic speed of lightning, smashes between them,
almost knocking  Francis over. He reels, Logan catches him and they
recover in time to see   the trio rip wildly through the crowd,
knocking people down, screaming  with shrill joy as they disappear.FRANCISThe damned Yellows are getting out 
			of hand. Those three ought to be in 
			Cathedral. No business scrambling in 
			Arcade...

						LOGAN (laughs 
					cuffs Francis' arm)
			What an old, old man you're getting 
			to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a 
			Yellow? I bet you were even wilder 
			than -
					(he breaks off as the lights 
					in the Great Hall dim) 
			-- come on, Sandman.

The two of them start to move to the far end of the Great Hall.30		FULL SHOT - GREAT HALLAs everyone begins to move to the far end, where great  curtains
have parted to reveal31		ARCADE GREAT HALL - CAROUSEL ENTRANCEAC the far end of the hall, where the throng is a huge crystal
design ornaments an entrance  The crystal is red and pulsing
rhythmically to the accompaniment of a deep and thrilling  TONE. As
we move toward it with Logan and Francis, the TONE  deepens, the
great pulse takes on a hypnotic quality...32		WITH LOGAN AND FRANCISIn the crowd they overtake a fellow Sandman,  DANIEL, and fall in
step with him. When they  speak now, their voices are hushed.LOGANYou should have been with us in Nursery,  
			Daniel. I'm positive I  recognized him -

						FRANCIS (hustling
					Logan)
			Come on. I don't want to miss the
			filing-in. There'll be some I know
			tonight, I think...

						DANIEL (glances at his
					own red crystal, nods)
			Yes. Me, too. You know we're
			both on Monitor tonight.FRANCISDamn! That's right. Just when I
			feel like an ALL OUT BLAST in
			Arcade .LOGANWant me to take your shift? I'm
			feeling restless anywayFrancis glances at him, exchanges a look with Daniel. They vanish
into the throng passing under the great crystal, turn the corner and
we see33		FULL SHOT - CAROUSELframed in a huge corridor we see a steep-sided  arena dropping down
to a shadowy center, which  even now pulsates and flickers in
changing  dimensions, but always maintaining the jewel- flower
shape. There is one entrance into the center -- a kind of ramp from
below the seats, leading directly into the mysterious bowl --	
Just now the seat's are filling, and the sense of expectation builds
People sit and immediately crane their necks, waiting...34.		ANOTHER ANGLEFeaturing Logan and Francis as they find places in the arena. Like
the others, they crane upward. As they do, Logan gestures at a
number of pretty girls who are just being seated.LOGANNow there's a few who could have been 
			his seed-mother.FRANCISOnly a few? You're just not trying.35-36	    OUT37		PANNING THE CROWDAs the seats fill, the excitement builds. Suddenly the lights begin
to dim and dim...

SOUND: A kind of collective sigh, breathing in unison...38 		OUT38X1		ANGLE THE TIER BELOW THE SEATSSuddenly visible, the LASTDAY GROUP. Their arms are upraised and in
each palm the crystal blinks red-black, red-black.39		THE CROWDTransfixed, gripped with a religious fervor.40		LASTDAY GROUPHands still raised, filing slowly into the mysterious well of
Carousel.41		CROWDTense, beginning nervous APPLAUSE here and there.42		CAROUSELAs the last one enters, beginning to glow and, as it does, the bowl
slowly puts out leaves like some great plant, enfolding and hiding
the people within a series of translucent petals. As the Last one
enfolds them the Light intensifies, the exterior surfaces seeming to
shift as if a kind of motion was beginning inside it...43		CROWDVisible in the growing Light from Carousel -gripped with passion and
excitement, APPLAUDING, gesturing as they see44		CAROUSELMoving, bands of light seeming to spiral upward Like a contained
aurora as the Carousel picks up speed.45		LOGANCaught up in it Like the rest.46		CAROUSELBeginning to blur with its own speed. Through the shifting,
spiraling curtain of light we see bodies moving in a kind of
weightlessness, always struggling to move higher.

Follow a shadowy form as it moves, twists through other writhing
shadows -- upward, upward. Suddenly the form is spread-eagled, and
in a moment it is sharply outlined against the swirling canopy and
then -- a searing flash. And it is gone.SOUND: Crowd in a frenzy -- SCREAMING.47		FULL ANGLE - THE BLEACHER CROWD - FAVORING LOGANStanding. SCREAMING their cheers as:48		FULL SHOT - UP AT CAROUSELHigh, reaching downward out of the shadows beneath the dome,
fringing, intersecting rainbow bands appear, looping the swirling
upper Carousel like Saturn's rings. Now we see figures reaching
outward toward them...reaching and missing and falling -downward
against the curtain and the flash of extinction.49		MEDIUM ANGLE - A MANAt the highest level...straining for the rainbow...50		SWEEPING PAN SHOT - THE BLEACHER CROWDHysterical...starting to chant...CROWDRenew!

The man continues to strain:CROWDRenew!51		CLOSE ANGLE - THE MANAlmost a blur...but still straining:CROWD'S CHANTRenew!52		CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND FRANCISLOGAN AND FRANCIS(chanting with the rest) 
			Renew!53		CLOSE ANGLE - THE MANThe blur...but still there...straining with all his might for the
rainbow...CROWD'S CHANTRe...

Suddenly, the man...topples into the whirling blackness
below...where he is instantly incinerated.54		WIDE ANGLE - THE CAROUSELWhirling - whirling - the rainbows shining.55		WIDE ANGLE - THE BLEACHERSOrgiastic pleasure -- a Spanish crowd at a perfect killing --
SCREAMING, fulfilled.56 		OUT57		FULL ANGLE - THE CAROUSELOther figures move to the topmost level...straining for the rainbow
bands.58		CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND FRANCISAs the SCREAMING goes on in the b.g. of the SHUT... we hear a
BUZZING noise. Logan reaches into a pocket and takes out a small,
dark plastic box.

Logan looks at the box. On it we see:MAN: RELIVE STORE 14LOGAN(to Francis)	
			Looks like I'm working.Francis stands.LOGANWho invited you?FRANCISI'm in my party mood.Logan smiles . . . and the CAMERA PANS them rushing out of the
bleachers.

They make their way into the hall.

Logan takes out the small plastic box. We can tell from his face
that he is disappointed...until a faint BEEPING SOUND emanates from
the box.

Francis watches as Logan wheels in one direction... the beeping
stops. He turns in another direction... again, there is no beeping.

As Logan turns in a third direction...the BEEPING commences.
Logan and Francis move swiftly in that direction and the BEEPING
GROWS LOUDER...AND LOUDER...until Logan and Francis see:59-59X11	    WIDE ANGLE - A MANrunning.

CHASE: INTER CUT between Logan and Francis following the running man
in the great hall...empty. We can HEAR the CROWD SCREAMING in
Carousel offstage.

A. Logan and Francis separate...to encircle the running man.

B. The running man turns a corner and for a moment Logan cannot see
him.

C. As Logan turns the corner...Francis is on the other side and
FIRES at the running man...JUST MISSING HIM.

D.Francis winks at Logan as he pursues the running man up a ramp
and Logan gets it:  A little cat and mouse is in order.(NOTE: THE CHASE WILL BE THE DIRECTOR'S OPTION.)E. Logan FIRES... just missing the man...Francis FIRES again. . .
just missing, too.

F. The man is in a panic as he continues up the ramp...to various
levels and areas.

G. Both barrels (of Logan and Francis' respective guns) glow again
as they FIRE...with both just missing the running man once more.

H. The man's face is crazed...and sweating...the mouse is going
berserk as he has been chased to a high level.

I. He stands frozen, petrified, driven to the edge of a high balcony
by the shots--teetering now. He is in full sight of Logan, Francis
is across the hall.

J. The Runner�s face. He looks at death twenty feet away--Logan
aims.

K. Francis, watching, smiling at the perfect moment.

L. Logan's face. A shadow of thought, a hesitation.

M. The Runner lunges. Logan fires, misses.

N. Francis fires a salvo, drives the Runner back to the rail where
he teeters again, throws his hands in front of his face and plunges.
The SCREAMING in Carousel reaches a peak.59X12-63X1		    OUT63X2		WITH LOGANAs he arrives at the dead body of the Runner, bends over him, turns
the man's left hand up. We see the flower crystal. Black.
Logan takes out his transceiver.63X3		INSERT TRANSCEIVERA man's face visible. Logan checks it against the face of the dead
man. They are not the same.63X4		ANOTHER ANGLEAs Francis comes up, waits. Logan moves the transceiver to the dead
man's face, rests it on his forehead.63X5		INSERT TRANSCEIVER READOUT:The words appear: IDENT. AFFIRM....NEW YOU #483 ALTERATION63X6		LOGANScowls for a moment, then shrugs. He takes out a small flat pouch
and methodically strips from the body its few personal things,
stuffs them into the pouch. Then his eye is caught by the man's
right hand, clenched. Logan opens it. A metal ankh on a bit of
chain. It means nothing to Logan who stuffs it into the pouch and
closes it. Now again he fiddles with the transceiver, speaks into it
softly.LOGANRunner terminated 0:31
					(a beat)
			Ready for cleanup.

Done with his job, he rises to face Francis.LOGAN(smiling)
			That was a great shot you made.FRANCISYes.
					(beat)
			But you look a little rusty to me --
			what were you doing, wondering?

Logan shrugs. He's not sure himself. Together they walk off down the
hall, passing CAMERA63X7		ANOTHER ANGLEWe see in the distance, a pair of Stickmen descending into the hall,
riding through the air on their odd vehicles, passing overhead then
descending. One hovers not far away as the other comes down, hangs a
few feet over the body.63X8		1ST STICKMAN AND BODYThe driver makes sure he's in position, then presses a button on one
of the arms of the vehicle. There is a broad spray of vapor from the
bottom which covers the corpse.63X9		CORPSE (INSERT)It turns to crystals which sag away from the human form, as a sand
sculpture erodes when it's dry.63X10		1ST STICKMAN CLOSE ON HEAP OF CRYSTALSSatisfied, he revs his machine and it rises smoothly out of the
SHOT. As it leaves, the second machine moves down and into its
place.63X11		2ND STICKMANGlances at the crystals, maneuvers into position, presses his
buttons.63X12		CLOSER ANGLE - THE CRYSTALS, STICKMANSucked up into the machine as it hovers. As the floor is once again
bare, the 2nd Stickman revs slightly and his machine pulls up and
away.63X13		ANOTHER ANGLEAs the Stickmen move up and out, we see the exhilarated crowd
beginning to pour out of Carousel.63X14		LOGAN AND FRANCIS - ARCADEDescending from the top level -- not much of a crowd. Francis is
gesturing toward the Hallucimill.FRANCIS...Well I think you're getting stale. 
			You need old Lucey--Go on. Gee the whole 
			burn--try the new psycho-lift-they tell 
			me it turns you inside out...

He shoves Logan in that direction and continues on down.FRANCIS(calling after him)
			I'll look for you here when I'm off--

And he is gone.63X15		LOGANwaves, smiling, then turns to the Hallucimill.63X16		POV - HALLUCIMILL EXT.Crazy, man.63X17		BACK TO LOGANHesitates, as a COUPLE push past him gleefully on their way. He
looks and we see:63X18		POV - ARCADE, UPPER LEVELSThe people from Carousel starting to pour in, loud, happy, ready for
more fun.63X19		LOGANNot with it. He turns and starts making his way downwards towards
the exit.63X20		LOGAN'S APARTMENTAs he enters. Idle, restless. He crosses to a sideboard--makes
himself a drink, sips, doesn't like it. Gets rid of it, makes
another. He fiddles with things, a game--sits, gets up. Now he is
beginning to feel the drink. Takes another belt, smiles. Now he goes
over to a tall wall recess flanked by a console with many dials.63X21		AT THE WALL RECESSAs Logan dials, blurred and smoky images appear in the recess--a
slow protoplasmic eddying in many colors. He tunes it in and the
figure of a smiling young man appears--bejeweled, lustrous, willing.63X22		LOGAN AT THE CONSOLEBored as Mastroianni turns the dial again and the young man
dissolves. He dials again and now a beautiful young woman takes
shape. It is Jessica.63X23		JESSICA AND LOGANStill in the recess, she makes no gesture of interest, no smile.
Around her neck, from a collar, a dangling ankh. It catches Logan's
eye. He smiles, clicks another dial and she becomes real. He reaches
out a hand and leads her out into the room.64		LOGAN AND JESSICAAs Jessica turns to him, Logan moves in strongly and embraces her-
but, to his surprise, she resists. Logan, still holding her loosely,
is amused and surprised.LOGANWhat's wrong, Available?JESSICA(breaking away gently) 
			Please . . .No.

She backs away, almost apologetically. Logan follows, smiling.LOGANPlease . . . no ?
					(noting that she looks trapped,
					he understands)
			You mean "not here"--that's it?
			You're a private Available but
			particular,
					(he is moving in on her
					as he speaks, she retreating, 
					which amuses him)
			Don't worry. There's no one here but me. 
			And you.JESSICANo. 
					(that stops him) 
			Just no.LOGANYou prefer women?JESSICANo.LOGANWell then...?JESSICANothing. I felt sad, I put myself
			on the circuit. It was a mistake.LOGANSad? What made you sad?JESSICAA friend of mine went on Carousel

			Yes...probably he was renewed?JESSICA(flatly)
			He was killedLOGANKilled? Why do you use that word?JESSICAIsn't it right? Isn't that what
			you do? Kill.LOGANI never 'killed' anybody in my life.

Logan stretches out his right hand. We see a red flower crystal
embedded and centered in his right palm. It is exactly the same
shape that we have seen in black in the palm of the dead runner.LOGANWhen this turns black...that's it.
					(laughs) 
			If for any reason you want to be 31...

Logan takes his gun and points it at her.

			Want to try?

Jessica shakes her head. Logan looks at Jessica carefully...in an
admiring sexual way...from her toes to her head...briefly noticing
(in the process) chat she is wearing an identical piece of jewelry
that he has taken off the dead runner...around her neck.LOGANWhat Quad do you live in?JESSICAK.LOGAN (softly)
			You're sure you don't want to try?

Jessica nods.LOGANIt's nice to know you can nod.	

Jessica smiles.LOGANIt's nice co know you can do that,
			too.Suddenly Francis and two dishevel led young WOMEN burst in and come
laughing toward Logan and Jessica Stoned, hilarious, they crowd
around Logan one of them embracing him. In the wild hilarity,
Jessica slips away and Logan, seeing her go, makes a vain effort
after her. Francis notices, laughs. Amid the noise he shouts to
Logan:FRANCISThese are for me -- you've got your
			own.
					(looking after Jessica)
			She must have been something--?At Logan's expression he roars with laughter Francis picks up an
atomizer and hurls it at the ceiling where it shatters and a great
pink cloud settles over them all.64X1		EXT. - SAND MAN H.Q.A frowning structure of dark stone and mirrored copper, fronted by
broad steps. Logan and Francis are climbing the steps as a SANDMAN
is coming out... His uniform is in tatters. They greet one another...then:LOGANWhat happened to you?

						SANDMAN (embarrassed)
			I lost a Runner in Cathedral.LOGANHow come?SANDMANRan into some Cubs I couldn't manage.

They wave. Logan and Francis continue.64AX1-64BX1	    OUT64CX1		INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. LOBBY (VOICE OVER)As Logan and Francis cross, turn into a corridor.LOGANI just might look in on New You 483

who are monitoring areas of the Megalopolis on video consoles. One
of these Sand-men speaks to Francis who hasn't greeted them

					SANDMAN (Monitor)
			What's with you, Francis?FRANCIS (touching his
				head; grimacing)
			Last nightThe other Sandmen, including Logan, smile as Logan and Francis
continue to:65-68	OUT69		INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. - DEBRIEFING AREABlack door opens revealing Logan and Francis who now enter a mammoth
room. As they walk. . . they pass FOUR GIANT LIFECLOCKS...WHITE,YELLOW GREEN AND RED.Each LIFECLOCK pulses out the moments of every person alive in the
city, governing everyone's crystal changes automatically shifting to
the next LIFECLOCK when the time comes.

There are no humans.

Francis walks over to a circular table at the end of the room....
above which is a circular overhang. There is a groove...the shape of
a palm crystal on one part of the circular table.

Francis takes out the plastic bag which contains the contents of the
dead Runner's pockets and starts putting the contents on the table.
(These contents are the ones from the Runner Francis has killed at
the beginning of the film.)

The moment the first item touches the table...it activates a scanner
on the overhang above.Francis stands alongside the table...his attitude is very matter-of
fact. He has been through this procedure many, many times.
He touches his head...(the hangover)...and Logan smiles. Moments
later...the scanner stops...the word:|IDENTIFYappears on a SCREEN. Francis places his palm into the groove. . .
and the words:CLEARFRANCIS-7appear on the SCREEN.FRANCISSee you in the hydrotoner!Logan nods.

Francis exits as Logan places the contents of a plastic bag with the
items he has taken off the Runner who jumped to his death. Among
them is the odd-shaped piece of jewelry.

Logan is standing nonchalantly...as the scanner moves over the
items...waiting to be quickly identified and cleared as Francis was
earlier.

The scanner continues scanning.

Logan starts becoming impatient...but the scanning goes on and on
and on.

Now...Logan is clearly puzzled...it has never...ever taken anything
remotely resembling this length of time.

Suddenly, directly before him...on the SCREEN... the word:PROBABILITYblinks on and off...on and off...catching Logan's attention. As
Logan turns toward the SCREEN...the scanner stops moving. The word
PROBABILITY blinks off and is replaced by the word:APPROACHWe can tell from Logan's expression as he walks to the corner. . .
that he has never seen this before.Logan sits in a chair in the area facing the SCREEN. There is a
stellar groove (that we have seen on the Table) the shape of a palm
crystal....glowing on an arm of the chair.

The word on the SCREEN is now:IDENTIFYLogan places his right palm with the flower crystal into the groove.
We hear a HUMMING NOISE....then: The piece of jade Jewelry appears
on the SCREEN and below the piece of jewelry the following words
appear on the SCREEN:OBJECT OCCURS IN NONRANDOMPATTERN AND FREQUENCY. LINKEDWITH OBSOLETE WORD: SANCTUARY.PROBABLE EXISTENCE ESTABLISHED.QUESTION: IDENTIFY OBJECT?LOGANNegative.

			But there's nothing outside!

The words on the SCREEN read:SANCTUARY DESTRUCT...FINDDESTROYLOGANI will.The words on the SCREEN read:ASSIGNMENT SECRET.LOGANQuestion:

The words on the SCREEN read:NEGATIVE. REPEAT: ASSIGNMENTSECRET. LOGAN-5 TRANSFER TORUNNER SEEKING SANCTUARY.Logan takes a breath.LOGANQuestion: I am six Red...how can

The words on the SCREEN read:LIFECLOCK--ALTERLOGANMy Lifeclock...
					(slightest beat)
			Question: My Life-- 

Before the startled Logan can finish...he feels a shock of pain and
his hand is immobile. Logan stares at the back of his hand as if it
wasn't his. His forehead shines with sweat.

Now the entire area, including the chair and the screen begins to
glow bright red. The glowing becomes so bright that Logan is forced
to close his eyes.

As the glow subsides...Logan looks at his right hand. The red flower
crystal in his palm is blinking. He stares at it, fascinated,
fearful.LOGANQuestion:
					(urgent tone)
			Am I still six Red?The words on the SCREEN read:LIFECLOCK-ALTERLOGAN (standing)
			I know that but I had four more years
				(extending the blinking palm)
			This means ten days to Lastday.
			Of course I will get the four years
			back, won't I?

The words on the SCREEN read:TAKE OBJECT WITH YOULOGAN (very urgent) 
			Question: Do I get my four years back?

Too late. The SCREEN is BLANK. For a moment his lips part as if to
say something more but he changes his mind, turns away.

Now Logan walks over to the table and removes the ankh. Almost
automatically, he starts moving his hand toward the groove...but the
SCREEN already has the words:CLEAR LOGAN-5Logan looks at it - then:

The CAMERA PANS Logan out of the mammoth room.... past the GIANT
LIFECLOCKS....where he pauses.... glances at his BLINKING
CRYSTAL....and continues out into:69X1		INT. - HYDROTONER - DAYSpectacularly 23rd century. Logan enters. He looks around and spots
Francis.... in a whirlpool bath....trying to recover from has
incredible hangover.

In the b.g. of the SHOT we can see some Sandmen doing calisthenics.
Logan walks over to Francis....hiding his blinking crystal by
holding his hand against his leg.FRANCISWhat the hell took you so long?LOGAN(after a beat) 
			Did you ever see anybody renew?FRANCISI think you've been skulling out too

			See you....FRANCISAt Carousel tonight?

Logan nods, exits. The CAMERA REMAINS on a slightly puzzled FRANCIS
for a moment then FOLLOW Logan out to:70		EXT. - SANDMAN BUILDINGLogan is on the steps, irresolute. He looks at his blinking
crystal...moves as if to reenter, changes his mind. Now takes out
the black box, dials.LOGAN(into box)

has obviously escorted her there.

						YOUNG SANDMAN (smiling)
			She says she's been here before...LOGANShe has.

Jessica half turns and shrugs a 'see?'. The young Sandman's smile
widens, he waves to Logan and shoves off.JESSICAYou could have called me yourself.LOGANBut I wasn't sure you'd come.JESSICA(the game has started)
			Here I am. 
					(beat)
			Shall I come in?

Logan gestures, leading her inside to the living area.LOGANI couldn't get you out of my mind.JESSICAI'm the most beautiful woman you've
			ever seen, I suppose?LOGANMaybe...sure....JESSICAThanks...but I have the choice.LOGANOf course.JESSICAThen it's still no.

Logan laughs.JESSICAYou can have any woman in the city.				
			What do you really want?LOGANYou knowJESSICAI don't believe you. There has to
			be more.LOGANAll right.

Logan extends his right hand. He turns his right palm so that.
Jessica can see it blinking red.

Jessica gasps for a moment...then:JESSICAWhy show me?LOGANI'm going to run.

						JESSICA (after
					reacting)
			Why tell me?LOGANYou know something.JESSICAAbout running, dying what?LOGANBoth...running's what I'm interested

Logan takes out the ankh.JESSICAWhere did you get that?LOGANA Runner gave it to me.JESSICAAnd then you killed him, right?LOGANI let him go...believe me.JESSICAI don't..

Jessica reacts. She is about to speak. . .doesn't..

Logan reaches out and touches her hand.LOGANWhat can I do to make you believe me?

Jessica draws her hand away quickly from his touch.

Logan stands and starts out...as Jessica watches him..74-81	OUT82		EXT. - A SLEEK, OUTDOOR RESTAURANT - NIGHTThere are three men and a woman seated at a table. Jessica reaches

After murmurs of agreement:SECOND MAN(staring at Jessica)

Jessica exits. They look at each other in dismay.. After a moment,
one of the men follows her. They don't trust her.90-92	OUT93-94 	OUT94A1		READY ROOM - FRANCISObviously enjoying the work, watching--tracking a Runner's progress,

followers, looks away. Logan does not notice. The followers are
partly reassured. One of the men is now holding a garrote made from
his necklace. The man who first followed gestures and the others go
off purposefully. He continues after Logan and Jessica as they exit
round a corner.94X9 	OUT94AX9	READY ROOMAs 1st Sandman returns, still cheerfully chewing. Francis is
reluctant to give up his place and when he does, he remains standing
there, watching. He loves the work--they all do.94X10	ARCADE - LOWER LEVELLogan and Jessica entering. Logan is aware of Jessica's increasing
tension. He pretends unconcern, but he is wary.94X11	ANOTHER ANGLEBehind them, visible through the crowd--two of the men we saw
before. The Follower and the man with the garrote. They are moving
so as to intersect with Logan and Jessica where the crowd is
thickest, streams coming together to move to a higher level.94X12	FEATURING JESSICAAs they move, fearful--torn between her promise and her feeling for
Logan. Catching a glimpse of the followers, she makes a small sound,
hesitates, pretends to have stumbled.94X13	THE AMBUSHERSCloser now, closing in -- the wire garrote gleaming between the
man's hands.94X14	LOGAN AND JESSICASuddenly she stops. He comes round facing as people eddy by them.
Logan looks at her searchingly.LOGANTell me, Jessica.

Behind him the two men move in. The man with the garrote raises his
hands. One more step... Logan senses something, half-turns just as
we hear a familiar urgent SOUND--the sound of his transceiver.
Behind him the man hesitates, drops his hands. Logan takes the
transceiver from his belt and moves out of the crowd to the side,
Jessica with him. Now he bends to read the message and Jessica
cranes her head to see too.94X15	READY ROOM - FRANCIS AND SANDMENAs the Runner alarm pulses and the readout flashes its message:RUNNER FEMALE: CATHEDRAL Q-2...LOGAN-5The Sandman at the console turns and says:1ST SANDMANHey, Logan's got a mean one tonight--

						LOGAN (smiling)
			Let's see - how long has it been?

As Jessica turns her head...looking somewhat guilty, the maze-car
slides to a stop.

A warning light pulses on the car's console and a RECORDED VOICE
speaks before the hatch opens.VOICEAttention passengers. Cathedral		
			Station is a personal risk area.	
			Persons with business are warned
			to be careful.121X1	EXT. - MAZE-CAR - CATHEDRAL STATIONNow the hatch opens. They step out, Logan first, Jessica timidly,
looking around. Behind them the hatch closes, the maze-car sighs
away into the distance.JESSICAI've never been in this quadrant.
					(looks off)
			Is that Arcade off there?There are standing on the maze-car platform -- a high overlook like
an "elevated" station.121X2	POV - THE CITY BEYOND THE WALLS OF CATHEDRALArcade shining like distant fireworks.122		EXT. - MAZE-CAR M PLATFORM - CATHEDRALBelow them a narrow, sharply angled concrete canyon, buttressed
walls rising featureless. The look of an old fortress, blank, dim
and cool. Still visible over an opening the chiseled legend
"Cathedral Plaza--2025 A.D.--Skidmore, Rosenfelt, Hennesy
architects."

Jessica shivers, looking around her. Logan takes her arm and they
descend into the canyon, move toward the wall. Their footsteps the
only SOUND.LOGANLet me go first. Sometimes they're 
			waiting just inside there--to rush 
			you when it opens...LOGANQuickly now--

He helps her through the narrow opening--the portal's walls are very
thick.. They turn abruptly and see:123		INT. - WALL - DAZZLE CHAMBERA room of angled, reflecting surfaces. At one end a jagged corridor,
also mirrored, leads away. The zigzag, angled effect creates an
absolute confusion of images. but Logan leads her unhesitatingly
across the chamber to the corridor. Jessica hangs back, momentarily
certain she's about to smash into something.

						LOGAN (guiding her) 
			Just follow--no matter how it seems...

						JESSICA (doing her
					best)
			But what is this--why?LOGAN (as they enter

tattered garment approaches them. She stops SINGING as she sees
Logan and Jessica.

						JESSICA (gently)
			Don't be afraid.

We see that it is a little GIRL of seven. Her face is grimy and hair
is tangled.JESSICAWhat's your name?MARYI'm Mary 2.JESSICAWhere do you live, Mary?MARYHere.JESSICAWhy aren't you in Nursery?MARYI'm very smart.JESSICAWhen do you go up?MARYI never go upstairs. You're a
			nice old lady.

As soon as she finishes her last sentence, Mary grabs at Jessica's
clothing...tearing a pin (piece of Jewelry) off...and running away
swiftly.

As Jessica instinctively starts after her...Logan... holds her back.LOGAN(shaking his head)
			Not here. Might be a decoy.

Cautiously, Logan and Jessica exit from the wall, stepping out into-125		EXT. - CATHEDRAL ITSELFAn area of rubble and dilapidated buildings.

Logan crouches, holding the transceiver and fanning the area,
listening...

SOUND: a soft beeping which abruptly grows louder and holds steady.

Logan gestures to Jessica to follow him, and moves carefully in the
direction of the BEEPING, quartering occasionally like a hunting
dog. Coming up to an angle of wall, he stops, flicks the sound off,
puts the machine back onto his belt. He gestures to Jessica to stand
still then he straightens, steps out, calls:LOGANRunner!

Silence. Jessica involuntarily moves to him and as she does, the
Runner moves from behind an upright and stands.- The figure is
shadowed, the arms out, palms facing in a kind of gesture of
surrender. In the Runner's left hand, the tiny red crystal pulses on
and off. The Runner is a woman!

There is an instant of frozen confrontation and then suddenly
Jessica gasps, grasping at him.As Logan whirls:125X1		ANOTHER ANGLESuddenly, from everywhere out of the shadows, a pack of snarling
Cubs materializes--moving with blinding speed. At their appearance
the Runner whirls and races off into the dark shadows. Logan makes a
futile gesture after her, then turns to face the Cubs.

A strutting, feral-faced fourteen or fifteen year old heads the
pack, dressed in fierce-looking tatters and hung with rip-off
trophies. He gestures to one of his followers to stand still.BILLY(speaking of the Runner) 
			Don't worry about her. We'll have that

After a beat, Billy turns and runs away.

Logan comforts the shivering Jessica for a moment then takes out the
small box from his pocket and turns it...until it starts BEEPING.

The CAMERA PANS Logan and Jessica...following the SOUND.

They move over the rubble...and cautiously around abandoned
buildings.

a door inside and kicks it down.

Her reaction is blank, then, with desperate ferocity she attacks
Logan again.

During the course of the struggle, Logan subdues her again.

Jessica enters, bends over the near-crazed Runner as Logan holds
her. Eyeing him, the woman stands and takes the small round

			And I did it myself right on there.144		FULL - ANGLE - THE SURGICAL APPARATUSAesculaptor Mark III -- the latest in servo-surgical designs.
Completely self-contained -- tilt-bed, cryojector services embedded
in the platform. The Mark III's laser heads are integrated into the
whole cocoon, swiveled and gimbaled so as to be able to focus any of
the surgical beams in microscopic delicacy or wide-bladed scraping.

The machine vaguely resembles an enormously complicated x-ray table
on an angle -- the great slotted laser heads overhanging it and
Integral with it. From the cryonic receptor base there is a steady
exhalation of cold -- the vapor seeping steadily downwards, blurring
the endlessly looped and tangled tubes and wires and containers
Which join in solid state circuitry so that any random or
involuntary twitch of a patient will be instantly compensated by an
equivalent move of the laser head -- keeping the focus precise.

At one end -- where the halves of the Mark III join, is n console of
switches and dials -- lights nod servo-recorders which control the	
operation from the first injection of cold to the final healing
vacuum drafts and scar burnishing. With the air of a magician
demonstrating, Doc goes to the console and flips switches. Instantly
the table responds -- the platform tilting, the crab-like laser arms
descending flexing -- small vapor jets oozing as the beams slash
harmlessly across the table. Beaming, Doc turns it off and the whole
apparatus subsides.DOCI designed it myself.

next to Doc, is slightly startled as the Table begins to HUM...as a
pair of laser beams separate themselves from the overhead cluster
and extend toward Logan, forming inner cones as they approach.

CryoJector needles start to close in on them, nearing their faces
and shoulders slowly...the visible cold streaming off the points.

A vibrobeam begins to KEEN.

SOUND: An insistent chiming.

Doc hears the sound and turns with the martyred air of a man who's
been called to the phone too many times. He turns to a phone-like
apparatus nearby, shifting the table into neutral as he turns. The
table and the laser heads stop moving.DOC(as if speaking on a phone)
			Hello

					(listening)
			Yes, they are.
					(listening; his expression
					changing)
			Done.

Doc turns back to the console, pausing to stare intently at Logan,
then up at the brightly smiling Holly. Something in his look
registers, and Holly's smile fades. Now Doc engages the machine
again...DOCPay attention, Sandman. I'm
			proud of this machine.

As he speaks he presses and an arm sweeps downward and into position
near Logan's face. It pauses asDOCWith this one there's no waiting
			for scar burnishing. It's all in

The laser arm sweeps across Logan's forehead and cheeks, leaving a
bright trail of blood asDOCBut here's the improvement. Instant 
			healing---before you feel a thing. 
			Watch now...

Doc pushes a special button and the arm sweeps back along the track,
spraying healing fluid. Magically the blood vanishes and the skin is
moist and whole.144X2		THE SURGICAL TABLE - LOGANHis face tense--he knows something's wrong. Over him Holly's bright

Logan's new wound. Again the blood disappears.Suddenly Doc's look is ferocious. He turns off the healing switch
and punches buttons fiercely. The laser arms begin to move wildly
and the SOUNDS become shrill. Holly looks alarmed.HOLLYNo! You're scrambling the table.

At the sight, a BABBLE of SOUNDS. Argument.VOICEHe's lying. No Sandman ever ran.2ND VOICEYou don't run. You kill runners.
			You have killed runners all your life.	-LOGANYes I have.

			Now it's my turn. And I want to

Another angry murmur of VOICES. Over it Jessica suddenly:

						JESSICA (shouting) 
			What's the matter with you. He's a runner--
			he's blinking. We must help anyone who 
			asks...we must-or we're the same as they 
			are--deciding who lives and dies.

One of the points lifts and touches Jessica's cheek. A quick, fierce
burn. She shrieks--a tiny sound--and is silent.206		LOGANReacts fiercely, spinning against the spear points, he is Jabbed and
pierced in a dozen places as he manages to get Jessica closer,
shielding her with his body. But the spear points are too much. He
subsides, as VOICES rise angrily "Kill him now".

Suddenly a RINGING ALARM. All sound stops at once and we hear a
CLATTER of FOOTSTEPS down the iron stair and across the outer floor.
The spotlight bursts on again and a figure staggers into the
chamber, straightening into the light, hair dishevelled, hands in
front against the glare. It's Holly.HOLLYHolly. Holly, New You 483... He's dead. 
			Doc's dead and the Sandmen came...

			Holly. Station 12, Sanctuary 7.
			Holly. Holly...

She lowers her hands and we see her, tattered, frightened--the
bright smile strange. She comes to herself a bit, looks to the side
and sees Logan and Jessica, pinned against the wall.

She reacts with fear at the sight.HOLLYIt's him! The first Sandman. He
			killed...Doc.JESSICANo, Holly--wait! He's running.
			Tell them the rest!HOLLY (suddenly
					exhausted)
			He's the one. You too. I remember.

Holly suddenly remembers and the shock makes her lucid.

						HOLLY (pouring 
					it out) 
			That's right. The other one came after. 
			The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!

						JESSICA (coaching
					desperately)

						HOLLY (remembers)
			Yes. Oh yes.

			He was after you. I remember. You're

shaken, wary.LOGANMay we move?

A long beat. Then--VOICEI saw we pass them through.			
			Somebody help Holly.	

Other VOICES mumble agreement. Holly moves off into the dark room,
hands reaching out to help her.VOICEYou two. Just go straight ahead. 
			Follow the corridors with the pipes 
			overhead to the end. Then use the key.

As the voice speaks the spotlight finally goes off and by a dim glow
around the perimeter, we see we're in some kind of large underground
chamber--some part of the vast undercellars of the city. The light
is enough to reveal that there are perhaps twenty people in the
room, reds and greens both--but all are silhouetted, no face seen.
There's a kind of aisle open down the room's center and it's
obviously the way they are to go. Logan and Jessica move off. Logan
pauses.LOGANI don't know who you are. I'd
			like to thank someone.VOICEIt doesn't matter who we are. Follow 
			the tunnel to the end.LOGANI Will there be someone to tell us
			where to go from there...?

A murmur of discussion then:VOICESomeone will follow. When you come to 
			the lock, he will tell you how Co go 
			on the other side. Jessica may go with 
			you as far as the lock.LOGAN(a deep breath) 
			No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back. 
					(suddenly his tone is 
					urgent as he speaks to her) 
			Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.

She is bewildered by the change.JESSICAWhy?- No...no...I'm going with you.VOICE1Only to the lock. After that 
			there's no way back. 

						JESSICA (small voice) 
			I don't care. I'm going to Sanctuary.

A BABBLE of VOICES. "Impossible"...She ignores, watches Logan.JESSICA (cont'd)
			Will you take me with you?LOGANWhy, Jessica? You're still a green.JESSICA shakes her head. She doesn't know why.

Logan puts his arm around her, marveling, trying to understand,
moved. But suddenly he remembers the urgency of the moment. He
wheels, pulling her with him.LOGANCome on then--they'll be here any
			minute!

Uncomprehending, she starts to run with him. Too late. An EXPLOSION
shakes the chamber--the wall bellies inward and a group of Sandmen,
led by Francis, burst into the room, firing as they come.Panic. Turmoil. PEOPLE running, SCREAMING--the ALARM BELL RINGING,
RINGING as Sandmen methodically slaughter the people in the wreckage
of the room.209 		OUT209X1	LOGAN AND JESSICAAs the brief, one-sided battle rages, echoing SHOTS and SCREAMS in
the dust filled room, Logan pulls her down out of the way. They
watch, helplessly. Suddenly the figure of a Sandman looms before
them. He stares at Logan, unsure. Logan reacts, draws, fires. The
Sandman is smashed away, burning.209X2	LOGANSuddenly aware that he has killed a Sandman. Jessica pulls him down
again into the shadow. Neither realizes chat the soft pulsing of his

After the slightest beat, Logan FIRES and Francis falls, a great
chunk of the cave roof falling between him and Logan -- all vision
obscured while EXPLOSIONS and SCREAMS continue.212		LOGAN AND JESSICAAs he pulls her shakily to her feet. She nods, she's okay. He leads
her off down the tunnel.213		WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - TUNNELfollowing the tracks. The way leads down, curves, recurves, but
always down.214		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING LOCKAs Logan and Jessica rush toward it. The corridor has widened into a
kind of chamber which ends in a great metal door like an immense
submarine hatch.

The tracks run straight to it and beneath it. The base of the door 
tands in a couple of inches of water.With great urgency, Logan and Jessica examine the huge door. Logan
gives the wheel a tug...nothing.

SOUND: A WHIRRING like clockwork...A METALLIC BELL SOUND and then aRECORDED VOICE.VOICERunner, this is the last gate. Use			
			your key now. When the Bell sounds			
			again...use your key. Good luck,
			Runner. May you find Sanctuary.

SILENCE. Then the BELL CHIME SOUND and a light illumines the center
of the wheel where there's a kind of keyhole. The WHIRRING continues
for about ten seconds. Then it stops	and the light goes out.214X1	LOGAN AND JESSICAHearing a SOUND they turn and see:214X2	ANOTHER ANGLE - P.O.V.Far behind them, in the wet glisten of the tunnel, a bobbing light
and shadow -- the SOUND of RUNNING215-216	CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND JESSICAAs Jessica takes the ankh from her neck - fumbling with the chain.

						JESSICA (breathlessly) 
			Every key only works once...and only 
			a Lastday key must open this door.... 
			They said it would fit - but....

She tries to fit the ankh into the glowing one, but her hand shakes.
Logan tries to steady her - and in helping, she drops it into the
dark pool of water. They fall to their knees, searching desperately.
Then Logan remembers.LOGANWait - I have the one I took from 
			the Runner.

SOUND: The same as before as Logan searches his pockets for the
Runner's ankh.

Logan finds it just as the WHIRRING SOUND has STOPPED again...and
the light has gone out again in the center of the wheel.

As Logan and Jessica wait for the sound, etcetera to repeat again
another TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION is heard rocking everything.  In the
distance, Jessica can see the shadow of a FIGURE approaching.

As the SOUND, etcetera, repeat-s once more...Logan pushes the ankh
into the lighted center of the wheel. The ankh fuses and the lighted
center becomes brighter as the door opens.

There is a hesitation...in which Logan turning his head back...
realizes what he has done and is shaken.

As the shadowed FIGURE looms LARGER:JESSICAThere's no turning back, is there?

Logan turns and pushes Jessica through the door... following her...
as the door closes and they are:217		ON THE OTHER SIDEnow, they can still hear the SOUND, etcetera for the last time.

Beyond the lock is the ruins of a vast undersea complex in which
food was raised and harvested. What we see is an endless shadowy
labyrinth of breeding pens which stretch off into the green darkness
-- a kind of mammoth aquarium with catwalks and ramps intersecting
the huge tanks. The levels are multiple and everything is slimed,
rusted, rotted and wet.

In the tanks themselves are shoals of fish, gardens of seaweed, etc.
The machinery for harvesting and winnowing has long since gone to
rust -- and visible in the great tanks are the wrecks of vessels and
gear -- the kind of stuff Cousteau and Co. are using now.

Footing is dangerous -- a slip from any catwalk means a plunge into
water and some of the walkways are well under water anyhow. From an
invisible ceiling comes a steady dripping and everything is crusted
and smells of salt and decay and life in the darkness.217X1	WITH FRANCISAs he arrives at the door, the ankh glowing as before.

But Francis has a light. He examines the door with it, and as it
lights the pool of water on the ground, it picks out Jessica's ankh.
FRANCIS stoops, gets it and looks from it to the one glowing128		LOGAN AND JESSICABewildered -- uncertain, as their eyes adjust to the dim light.
Finally, Logan gestures ''this way" and sets out.

(NOTE: The action of the sequence is the action of people groping
through a labyrinth. They go along, gripping a rail where possible,
sometimes sinking deep into water, sometimes rising above it. They
run into blind endings and retrace to the last junction -- always
trying for what looks driest and seems to stretch farthest along the
great wall...)219-224	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - SERIES OF CUTSA. Making their way along the walkway side by side.

B. Stopping as the walkway disappears under water. Logan wading in
while she waits -- until he re-emerges. She follows.	

C. Choosing between diverging ramps. Having to return.JESSICAHow do we know this is the right

turn -- great rusty net-combs start to winnow the water.

E. Helping Jessica, Logan slips...falls into darkness. Jessica's
fear until he emerges, hand over slimy hand. The water is cold.

F. POV ancient signs - PROTOPLANK...DEPOT NO #11 DO NOT DECANT...HABITAT MARITIME...ETC.They speculate.JESSICAWhat do you suppose this was...?LOGANSome kind of breeding pens...I

			It must have been a savage world.Logan shrugs, but the idea makes him queasy, too.G. They stop, tired. Peer through at the wreckage of a small
inspection vessel and suddenly hear:

SOUND: FOOTSTEPS, coming, halting, WATER sloshing. Steps again.225		POV - THROUGH THE MAZE OF TANKS - A LIGHTmoving, hunting.

						LOGAN (alert)	
			Stay here, while I see what it is.	

Jessica nods, frightened. Logan slips off into the darkness. In a
moment he's back. His face - is grim.JESSICAIt's Francis, isn't it?

He nods.226		LOGAN AND JESSICATrying to move faster now, Logan makes a wrong turning and they must
go back. But as they do so, Francis is ever closer -- a gigantic
distorted SHAPE now visible through the eerie glass -then suddenly
seeming small and distant.

As they emerge from the blind alley once again close to the wall,
suddenly:227		FRANCISlooming huge, gun drawn, apparently only a few feet away.228		LOGAN AND JESSICALogan desperately claws at machinery, succeeds in starting motion,
somewhere what sounds like a GENERATOR begins laboring, ancient

					echo; etcetera)LOGAN N N N.229		POV - FRANCIS' LIGHTis splashing the walls ahead and in it they suddenly see:

THE DOOR -- a waterlock with a wheel. As the light passes, Logan
heaves desperately on it. It starts to give as the light comes back
and they are revealed.230		CLOSE - ON FRANCISaiming at Logan...then slowly moving his hand until Jessica is in
his sights.231		LOGAN - JESSICA - FRANCISFrancis FIRES -- tremendous SOUND, ECHOING and RESOUNDING. One of
the great tanks buckles and a cascade of water erupts over
everything. Through it, Logan manages to get the door open and
pushes a half-drowning Jessica through.232		INT. - THE SHAFTA sort of ancient freight elevator which commences to move groaning
when the waterlock door closes.Logan slumps to the floor.233		INT. - SHAFT - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICAMoving at an extremely high speed...We can see the outside -
flickering - dark, light, - dark, light... and finally to a white
color. They lie slumped, motionless. Finally it stops. The door
opens into a kind of glistening darkness, suffused by a bluish glow.
It is now very cold.

In the silence Logan stirs. Groping, he touches Jessica, who moves
close to him. Logan puts his arm around her and they rise. Slowly,
tentatively, he leads her out into the dark chamber where they stand
for a moment trying to find themselves. What little light there is
seems to come from the left. Arm around Jessica, Logan starts to
move.

						JESSICA (whispering) 
			I'm afraid.LOGANIt's brighter there...besides, we
			can't go back.

He starts to move again but Jessica hangs back.JESSICAWait.

of trees and stand looking O.S. past CAMERA Behind, a flicker of
firelight.

						JESSICA (gently,

They turn, the Old Man still marveling at the sight.P.O.V. WHAT THEY SEE (TO BE INTERCUT)NIGHT (Matte) view of the domed city seen through a fringe of trees and beyond distance hills.361X1B	EXT. - WOODED AREA - NIGHTAs the three return to where a small fire is burning on the ground.OLD MANThat's better than gold when it's cold.LOGANThank you.			
					(turning to Old Man)	
			Tell me - what do those words mean?
			"Beloved husband�...�Beloved son"...
			"Beloved wife"'...OLD MANMy father was the husband and my

			a word they used - to stay together.LOGANStay? They lived together all their years?OLD MANOh, yes...I think...

						JESSICA (reading;

			�Beloved son�... 
					(a beat) 
			So people stayed together for that

			I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we

						LOGAN (facing Jessica) 
			Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
					(a beat)JESSICAAnd Sanctuary?LOGANSanctuary is the right to live.... 
			nothing more. But nothing less, either....

There is a long beat...then Jessica snuggles up to Logan...she is
ready for sleep.

The Old Man marvels at what he sees...they walk on.362		LONG, LONG ANGLE - LOGAN JESSICA AND THE OLD MAN - DAYWalking up the beach toward the domed city. We get an idea of the
scale. They appear as ants in front of redwood trees.363 		OUT364		LOGAN, JESSICA AND THE OLD MANApproaching. The wave power inlet in f.g.

The CAMERA PANS LOGAN, JESSICA and the OLD MAN down the STRANGE
STEPPED CONSTRUCTION until they reach:366		FULL ANGLE - A POOL OF WATERAt the CENTER of this IMMENSE WATER FLOWING CONSTRUCTION OF STEPS.

After a beat Jessica looks at the Old Man:LOGAN (softly)	
			I know...
					(after a beat; to the
					Old Man)
			We're going to try and get in this

The Old Man watches Logan and Jessica dive into the POOL and
disappear.367		THE OLD MANhe bends and plays with the water in the POOL for a moment...like a
young child at a pond or lake.368		INT. - POWER CENTER OF THE CITY - LOGAN AND JESSICAEmerging from the water.

It is a labyrinth of humming turbines, automonitored cables and
impulse collectors.

Logan leads her swiftly through the humming maze toward an exit.369-369Xl 	OUT369AX2	GREAT HALL - AT CAROUSEL ENTRANCEAs the CROWD is pouring in:LOGAN'S VOICENo!! Don't go in there !!

Looking down at them.LOGANYou don't have to die!! No one has

There is an angry murmur in the CROWD as Logan continues:

			See... it's' clear. The Lifeclocks
			are a lie - Carousel is a lie!!369X3	WIDEN ANGLE - INCLUDING SANDMENTrying to grab Logan. There is a struggle. Some Sandmen are knocked
over the railing.

But remaining Sandmen fire a gas tranquilizer which subdues Logan
and Jessica.

The CROWD cheers...and continues into Carousel as:370		INT. - SANDMAN DEBRIEFING AREAIt is the same area where Logan received the original assignment to
find and destroy Sanctuary.

In the rear...with the panel open...the sign reading:PROBABILITYblinks on and off.		

Logan is dragged in by a number of SANDMEN.

We see Jessica , too, still groggy, being held by SANDMEN in the
b.g. of the SHOT.

-- one after the other -in response to questions. Each of these
heads is Logan. Each revolves slowly on its axis as it responds.

As the real Logan (in the chair) is questioned, each of the heads
answers in turn. They are each a part of his persona and his brain.373-378 	OUT378X1-378X18	INTERCUT WITH CLOSER SHOTS OF LOGAN HIMSELF WRITHING INAGONY AS THE IMPASSIVE HEADS SPEAK.ANOTHER ANGLE - LOGAN AND HEADSA. 						FIRST HEAD SPEAKS(Logan's voice)

with it. In the noise and confusion, the fight becomes general. A
Sandman fires back at Logan, misses -- the shot hits one of the
Lifeclocks which flares electrically, ribboning out a great arc.
Instantly Logan gets off a couple of shots at the other Lifeclocks
which similarly flare and burst into violent electrical fire and
discharges.410X4	THE BATTLEThe electrical discharges, smoke and noise making great confusion.
Sandmen hampered by their own numbers and by trying to miss the
machinery. Logan firing methodically at the Lifeclocks, moving.
Stumbles over Jessica, prone in the smoke. Helps her to her feet.

panicking, running in different directions. Some pressing into
Carrousel for safety.410X12	CAROUSELAs people run in there, the red crystal glowing and sputtering, the
petals moving spasmodically. As people look, the white crystal comes
on, begins spinning wildly, bursting into strange, lancing lights. A
great roaring commences and the whole arena starts to rock with the
crystals. Now the white crystal explodes and the whole room is
crisscrossed with deadly arcing discharges. People flee the scene of
destruction.410X13	GREAT HALLThe panic is-full, people getting the hell out of there.410X14	ARCADEPeople are stampeding like cattle, all heading down and for the

people...who look up and see the starry heavens, too, as they
stumble forward into the darkness.

A wind begins to blow...where air had never stirred anything. There
is a sense of wonder. Hysteria is lessening...as the people find
themselves moving through the crack...as they discover the fact that
the crystals have disappeared from their palms.

Some are joyful...others frightened...others puzzled...as they
emerge from the crack in the dome at:412		FULL ANGLE - THE ACRES OF STRANGE STEPPED CONSTRUCTIONWe can still see the fires in the b.g. of the SHOT as Logan holds on
to Jessica...(like Gable onto Jeanette MacDonald at the end of SAN

AS people continue to mill all over the acres of strange stepped
construction...we see the Old Man WALKING INTO THE SHOT.

Logan and Jessica run to him. He looks around. People start to
gather...they have never seen a white-haired Old Man in their lives.

As people continue to gather around the Old Man... who couldn't be
more delighted...Logan and Jessica are smiling...inviting people to
touch him...and some do.

Yes, he is an old man...Yes, they will all live again to be old men
and old women...Yes, this is the world renewing itself once again.FADE OUT:THE END
