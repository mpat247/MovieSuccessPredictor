          nervous, apprehensive Rand to a dark corner of the room.

          GIGGLE echoes from inside the box.3.Rand is very puzzled.

          two legs. It has two arms, with small; four-fingered
          hands. Its body is covered with fluffy brown fur. The
          piercing eyes are big, sad. Its ears are long and pointed.
          A tiny black nose sits above a wide mouth, with small,
          square teeth.
          The creature is smiling. It lets out a giggle.
          Rand is delighted and surprised. He's never seen anything
          like this. The animal is more charming than a Disney
          character.
          The Oriental claps his hands.

          The animal licks Rand's cheek.' He laughs, amused by the
          creature.

          Rand removes five twenties from his wallet. He gives
          them to the man.

          onto Rand's shoulders. Rand pets it. Mogwai emits a cute
