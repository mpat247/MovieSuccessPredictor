           remember. It was dark, and it was
           cold. And I was scared.
                         
          The silhouette of a body appears as it drifts into a ray of
          light, refracted through water, which turns into...A MOON - SEEN IN REFLECTION ON A SHEET OF ICEThe moonlight intensifies almost magically, and the ice above
          begins to spider-web and crack.EXT. FROZEN POND - NIGHTSnow-covered trees in every direction. The ice in the pond
          continues to crack, until finally a hole splinters open. A
          young man floats out of the water, bathed in the intense
          moonlight. This is JACK FROST - thin, pale, barefoot, his
          tousled hair frosted white.JACK (V.O.)But then...then I saw the moon. It
           was so big and it was so bright,
           and it seemed to chase the darkness
           away. And when it did...I wasn't
           scared anymore.
                         
          Jack floats back down onto the ice as the hole closes up
          underneath him.JACK (V.O.)Why I was there, and what I was
           meant to do - that I've never
           known. And a part of me wonders if
           I ever will.
                         
          Jack looks around, confused, then turns toward the moonlight
          as it dims a bit.
                         
          Jack carefully treads across the ice until he hits something
          with his feet. He looks down, and at his feet is a wooden
          staff. Curious, he picks it up. Almost immediately the
          staff begins to glow a cold blue in his hands. Odd.

          Jack almost drops it as the base of the staff comes in
          contact with the ground. Frost shoots out and spreads across
          the ice. Jack is visibly confused.
                         
          He touches a few trees with his staff sending frost up their
          trunks. Then he swings the staff again, more confident, as
          he begins to run across the frozen pond.
                         
          Another swing, and a gust of wind swirls him high up into the
          air. Jack floats for a moment only to fall back down to
          earth and into the trees. Jack grabs hold of a tree branch
          and pulls himself up to see a small town off in the distance.EXT. BURGESS SETTLEMENT - TOWN CENTER - CONTINUOUSA collection of simple timber houses with thatched roofs.
          Jack comes in for a landing, and it's a rocky one. He stands
          up, still elated, and brushes himself off.
                         
          As Jack makes his way into town, settlers are warming their
          hands by campfire. Jack doesn't recognize anyone.JACK(to the townsfolk)

           where I am?
                         
          The boy runs right through Jack, as if he were a ghost. Jack
          staggers back in shock. He's speechless, as if the wind had
          been knocked out him. His emotions causing it to snow.JACKHello! Hello!
                         
          Townsfolk continue to pass through Jack, unaware of his
          presence. Shaken, Jack turns and retreats into the forest.JACK (V.O.)My name is Jack Frost -- how do I
           know that? The moon told me so.
           But that was all he ever told me.

          tattooed the word NAUGHTY, and on the other, NICE. North

          around the room, soldiers march about, toy planes fly

          A flying toy plane glides by and we follow it as it makes its

          Light EXPLODES from the staff and terror comes into Jack's
          eyes, clutching his chest as if in pain.
                         
          Suddenly, Pitch sends a burst of Nightmare sand, blasting
          Jack and slamming him into the iceberg wall behind him. As
          the ice cracks, Jack comes loose and falls forward into the
          chasm below.
