We HEAR "Waltzing Matilde," by Tom Waits.INT. MUSEUM OF MODERN ART - DAY (DREAM SEQUENCE IN GRAINY BLACKAND WHITE)Fade out music.

Silence.

A well-dressed black BOY and his MOTHER walk through several
galleries.

They stand before Picasso's "Guernica," holding hands.

The mother is disturbed. Crying.

The boy looks up, confused and frightened, concerned to see his
mother crying in public. She looks at him tenderly.

Her brow furrows. She stops crying. She stares just above his
eyes.

Something's happening: she looks with wonder at the top of his
head... his eyes roll upward, trying to see - it's a crown!

He raises his hands. He touches it.

A beam of light illuminates the crown, casting its glow on his
mother's face.

The beam gets whiter, the rest of the screen gets black.INT. CARDBOARD BOXSilence. In darkness, we hear a VOICE - imbued with a sense of
its own history:VOICE (O.S.)Everybody wants to get on the Van Gogh
           boat. There's no trip so horrible that
           someone won't take it. The idea of the
           unrecognized genius slaving away in a
           garret is a deliciously foolish one. We
           must credit the life of Vincent Van Gogh
           for really sending this myth into orbit.
           How many pictures did he sell? One? He
           couldn't give them away. We are so ashamed
           of his life that the rest of art history
           will be retribution for Van Gogh's neglect.
           No one wants to be part of a generation
           that ignores another Van Gogh.

The beam of light shines through a small hole. It falls upon a
sleeping, dreaming, delighted face. It belongs to JEAN MICHELBASQUIAT.OUTDOOR, DAYTIME SOUNDS filter in.Hearing the voice, Jean frowns at being woken up.EXT. TOMPKINS SQUARE PARK - DAYA long, rectangular cardboard box.SUPER: "NEW YORK CITY"ANGLE ON:RENE RICARD (early 30's), seated at a park bench, hunched over a
notebook. He's a raggedy dandy: A poet in a hooded sweatshirt and
white hightops.

As he writes, he reads aloud, as if addressing Posterity.RENE (CONT'D)(sighing theatrically)
            In this town one is at the mercy of the
            recognition factor. One's public
            appearance is absolute.

Beyond him, a HAND gropes its way out of the box. It tosses a can
of YOOHOO chocolate drink.RENE (CONT'D)I consider myself a metaphor of the public.
            I am a public eye. I am a witness.

A HEAD appears from the box. It's Jean's.

Jean sees the start of a crisp, colorful autumn day. The urban
park around him is alive with a typically full range of the good
and bad in life. He eases himself out of the oversize box in
which he has spent the night. There's something about the way
that he stands while waking up that suggests he's almost
surprised at his own body, the adultness of his limbs - just a
subtle hint of him coming out of a dream.

He squints in the sunlight. He has a soft, gentle, Haitian face.
His hair is pulled tight to his head. He wears two pairs of blue
jeans (one cut like chaps over the other) a paint-covered
Wesleyan University T-shirt, and the inside lining of an
overcoat. His appearance is unruly, but it's deliberate. He's
stylish.

He shakes himself off and collects his stuff, which includes: a
small book of Pontormo drawings, a can of black spray paint. and
a cigar box made into a loudspeaker with pencil holes and masking
tape.

Jean walks out of the park and looks up past the buildings at the
sky:SUPERIMPOSED IN THE SKY - STOCK FOOTAGE OF A HAWAIIAN SURFERJean sees the surfer, 'riding the nose' in glistening, shimmeringsunlight.DISSOLVE TO:EXT. TOMPKINS SQUARE PARK - DAYRene grabs the box for use as a desk and continues to speak out

            want to miss the boat. You have to be very
            careful because you may be staring at Van
            Gogh's ear.

Jean signs his words with his 'logo', a triple pointed crown.

As he presses the spray can, we HEAR the roar of a breaker.CUT TO:INSERT: CLOSEUP OF SIDEWALKPressed into the concrete is a pair of EYEGLASSES. A light-

on her.

She looks up and notices his stare. She continues to work.

Still staring at her, he sits down at a table. He pours maple
syrup onto the table. He draws in the syrup with his fingers.CLOSE ON SYRUP ON TABLEANOTHER WAITRESS arrives at his table. She's put off by the
syrup.WAITRESSWhat'll it be?

Jean thinks about it, eyes still following Gina.BASQUIATUmmm. It'll be great. We'll live together
           in peace. What's her name?
                  (indicates Gina)

He looks up at the waitress.WAITRESSGina. What'll it be?BASQUIATPancakes.

She leaves and whispers something to Gina. Gina turns and glances
over at Jean.

Jean pours more syrup and starts writing his name.

At the grill, LESHKO, the burly Owner/Cook, has his watchful eye
on Jean. He doesn't like what he sees.

Jean smears the syrup thinly, so it doesn't erase itself. He
draws a picture of Gina, using his fingers and the silverware,
rendering her last expression strikingly with a few quick lines.

A GAUNT YOUNG MAN saunters up to Jean's table. He's sort of a
tall Puerto Rican Alain Delon with sleepy eyes. He is BENNY.BENNYHey - Willie Mays.BASQUIATWillie Mays.Suddenly, Rene Ricard enters - a one-man parade. He beckons to
Gina, snapping his fingers.RENENurse!!! Oh!!! Nurse!!! Carrot juice. Tofu
           burger. Rapido!GINAWe don't serve that - amigo.RENEFine... A greasy cheeseburger. Fries - and

Rene lands at the counter.

Jean's gaze is still on Gina.

She waits on a MAN at a nearby table.CUSTOMERHow's the special today?GINAIt's your stomach.

She hurries past Jean.BASQUIATHey.

She slows down, not wanting to.BASQUIAT (CONT'D)What do you think?

She looks at her portrait in the syrup... She can't resist
smiling.GINAIt's me. I've never been done in maple
           syrup. Here's a rag.Gina smiles. She offers him one. As she holds it out, their eyes
lock. She tries to resist his smile.BASQUIAT(gently)
           Gina?

She puts her finger in the syrup and licks it off.

Benny takes it all in.

Leshko is upon them.LESHKOAlright. Look at you, staring at this girl,
           making a mess.

He waves Jean toward the door.

Jean takes Gina's rag and begins cleaning his mess, seemingly
compliant.BASQUIATHow about those pancakes?

He brings out a roll of dimes to the tabletop and splits it open.
Dimes roll all over the table and stick in the syrupy parts. The
manager explodes.LESHKOOK! Goodbye!GINAPipe down, Lech. Let him order.LESHKOYou nuts? Let him order? You on his side?
           You're not such a good waitress. You get

Behind them, we see Rene, absorbed in his writing.EXT. AVE. A - DAYThey stand outside, not knowing quite what comes next.

Jean gives Benny a look (i.e. 'scram').BENNYCatch you later.

Benny leaves.

A CHILLY WIND picks up.

Jean's mood is suddenly downcast.

They button up their overcoats, about to leave.GINAWhat's a job, anyway?
                  (pause)
           What's wrong with you?

The truth is, he feels awful for causing Gina's trouble, but
shows it by moping like a child.GINA (CONT'D)No, don't tell me - you just got fired by
           your crazy boss.BASQUIATI guess you did.GINAGuess I just got sick of him.BASQUIATCan I walk you home?GINAI think I could do that alone.

Gina walks away.

He runs after her.BASQUIATWait, I'm in a band....We're at the Mudd
           Club on Halloween. I'll put you on the
           list.Gina turns and looks back at Jean.GINAI hate the Mudd Club.

He catches up to her.

Gina notices a dead leaf in his hair and picks it out.GINA (CONT'D)Have you been camping? You could use a
           scrub.BASQUIATI'm clean. Smell me. I always smell good. I
           don't know why, I just do!

He leans forward, offering his neck.GINA(smelling)

           Yeah, if you have any dimes left. 477-0496.

He writes her number on his pant cuff with a big fat magic
marker.BASQUIATHere, this is for you. I made this.

He hands her the small speaker.

She takes it.GINAThanks.

She admires the speaker watches him walk off.EXT. MENTAL HOSPITAL (OUTSIDE THE CITY)We see Jean crossing a lawn outside a mental hospital.INT. MENTAL HOSPITAL - RECREATION / VISITING ROOM - DAYPSYCH. PATIENTS fill a cavernous day-room engaged in arts andcrafts. Some of the sadder patients stare off into space as Jean
crosses the room. He carries a plate of cookies and a full glass
of milk.

He approaches a sad, nice-looking, middle-aged black woman - the
same one from the dream, earlier. She sits alone fondling a
pillow in her lap. It's his mother, MATILDE. She doesn't see him
coming.

As he sets the plate in front of her, she notices him. She
recognizes him and seems pleased, even in her isolation. He
kisses her on the cheek.BASQUIATHey, mom.

She smiles slightly.

Jean takes a cookie. She does likewise.

They eat in silence, looking at each other, communicating what
they can.

Time passes. In between cookies her fingers find and break the
stems of the pillow feathers.BASQUIAT (CONT'D)I met the girl I'm gonna marry.

His mother brightens. She drinks the milk. They finish the
cookies.MATILDEDo you like it here?BASQUIATI'd like it better in Hawaii.INT. CARDBOARD BOX - NIGHTJean tries to sleep in the box. RAIN falls heavily onto it.

Drops of water hit his face.

He wills it to stop. It doesn't.

Finally, he can't stand it. Rain forces his blinking eyes open.INT. BENNY'S APARTMENT -     NIGHTA door opens to reveal Jean's wet face.

Benny lets him in.

Jean enters a rundown railroad flat crammed with musical
instruments, beer cans, and homemade art. There's a couch with a
sheet over it.

Junk is piled in a corner - mostly art books and drawings.Benny sits down at an electric piano, which he's evidently
playing. He sings along, softly, working out the words,
concentrating, absorbed.

Jean sets his belongings on the couch, walks to a mic stand and
starts making up his own words.BASQUIAT"She loves me.
           Oh yeah she loves me!
           She loooooooves me,
           Oh yeah she loves me!"
           Bring me some chicken, baby!BENNYWould you shut the fuck up? You hear what
           I'm doing?BASQUIATYeah man. I'm jealous. You're always great,
           Benny.
                  (goes back into 'act')
           "Her name is G-I-N-A Gina
           And she lo-oooves me."
           I did say chicken!

Benny turns off the piano and lights a roach, angry at Jean's
self-centeredness.

Jean digs through a pile of garbage. Finally, he finds what he's
looking for - a pile of "SAMO baseball cards" - color Xeroxes of
his favorite images and words. He pockets them.BASQUIAT (CONT'D)I knew I left these somewhere. One of
           these'll send your kids to college someday.
                  (hands it to Benny solemnly)
           Here - I made this for you.BENNYThanks.
                  (beat)
           Your dad called again - something about a
           job.

He hands Jean a slip of paper. He notices the number on Jean's
pants.BENNY (CONT'D)You got a date already?BASQUIAT(exhaling)
           We're getting married. She said she could
           tell I was a great artist - she could see
           it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by
           my side and have inter-racial babies with
           me.

Benny grins. He grabs a basketball and spins it expertly on hisindex finger.BENNYG'night... See you in court tomorrow.

Jean turns on the TV. He notices the roach. He picks up the paper
Benny gave him with the message from his father and sets it on
fire.

He lights the roach with it.

He looks up; on television, we see a BUM being interviewed. Jean
turns up the volume.

The bum's on the ground, looking beat up. Jean picks up a pocket
recorder and turns it on:BUMThe guy just hit me and I was on the
           ground!!!! Boom, for real.

Jean mutes the sound on the TV. He rewinds and proudly plays back
the words "Boom, for real."

He picks up the phone and dials. He turns on the speakerphone.

Jean holds the recorder to the speaker as someone answers the
phone. (Jean walks in and out of frame throughout the following.)VOICEHello?BASQUIAT(deadpan)
           I-Is this the s-s-suicide h-h-hotline?VOICEYes. My name is Chris. What's yours?BASQUIATJean Michel.CHRISThat's a beautiful name. French?BASQUIATHaitian. I'm going to kill myself. I'm
           taking pills. Reds, blues, greens.

Jean opens his notepad and looks down a long list of seemingly
random words. He comes to the words (in order) "liquid, hijack,"
and "Marlboros."CHRISWhat? Wait a minute... talk to me.BASQUIAT(about to sob)
           Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's
           k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack
           Marlboros!CHRISWhat? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't
           permanent. Don't you believe that?
                  (pause)
           What is it - did your girlfriend leave you?BASQUIATNo! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.

Jean spies an electric pencil sharpener and plugs it in.CHRISYou see? You have someone to live for.BASQUIATNo, I don't. I'm alone. We all are.
           Especially here. The world's unjust. The
           respect fools get. The disrespect I get.CHRISWhat is it you want?    Respect? I have
           respect for you, just    for making this call.
           One philosopher said    "Sadness is a sin
           against the richness    of the world." Think
           about it. Feel it.BASQUIATYou don't even know me. I want real
           respect.

He jams a pencil into the electric sharpener and holds the
receiver right next to it, giving the guy an earful:RRRRKKKKKKK!!!ANGLE ONCLOSE UP - A speaker. It fills the screen.

band Gray. Everyone but Jean is dressed in some sort of Halloween
costume.

We HEAR the words "Boom, for real" blasting from the P.A. system.What follows is a continuation, a collage of words from Jean's
"suicide hotline" call -P.A.One philosopher said "Give me my liquid
           hijack Marlboros. Life's beautiful. You
           have someone to live for. What do you want?

Jean sits in a chair onstage with his band members. Benny plays
the organ. The other band members play percussion and guitar.

It works. The crowd loves it.

The song ends abruptly.

We begin to hear James Brown's "Sex Machine."

Jean looks out into the crowd and notices Gina. She's looking
right back at him from the bar. Pleased to see her face, he says
to himself -BASQUIATBoom, for real.

We see him walk offstage into the crowd. They meet.BASQUIAT (CONT'D)I thought you hated this place?GINAI do.

He leads her towards the exit. They step out of the club.EXT. MUDD CLUB - NIGHTHIGH, WIDE ANGLEIt's raining heavily. Jean motions for Gina to wait under the
entrance. He tries to hail a cab... And another. And another.

A parade of them passes, but each time they slow down, they get a
glimpse of Jean and drive off.

Finally, Gina steps out of the entrance. She raises her hand, and
a car pulls over instantly.INT. CAB - NIGHTThey scurry into the backseat.The cab pulls off.EXT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHTThrough a steamy, rain-wet window, we see Jean and Gina seated at

Jackhammers RATTLE outside. (Music: REGGAE SONG - Errol
Scorcher's "Cockroach in de Corner.")EXTREME CLOSEUPA cockroach crawls from Gina's bedroom across the floor and into
the kitchen where Jean sits naked on the floor, working on a
drawing. It crawls over his drawing towards a cardboard box.

Jean rummages through a cabinet. He finds a can of bugspray. Jean
tears off a side of the box. With cardboard in one hand and
bugspray in the other, he forgets the cockroach.

He's mesmerized by the list of ingredients on the aerosol can.

Someone POUNDS furiously at the door.

Ignoring the pounding, he starts listing the ingredients on the
piece of cardboard, finishing his new drawing by including a
symbol of a cockroach to the left of the list.LANDLADYMiss Cardinale... Open up for me, please!

He gets up and peeks through the security hole. He sees a middle-
aged Hispanic woman reaching to unlock the door. He opens it.LANDLADY (CONT'D)Ohhh, Dios mio!

She stares at him levelly.LANDLADY (CONT'D)I just want the rent.BASQUIATWhy didn't you say so? Damn! She's asleep!

Jean draws on a piece of paper on the counter next to him. He
hands it to the landlady. It's a a little shack with a big head
next to it that says "'Here' For Rent."

The landlady looks at him like he's crazy. She balls up the
drawing and puts it in her pocket.Gina arrives in the doorway, wearing a robe. The landlady's
trapped between them.GINA(to Jean)

The landlady wags her finger at Gina.LANDLADYNext Monday.

Gina and Jean look amused as they watch her leave.BASQUIATWanna go get some breakfast?GINAA friend of mine offered me a job doing a
           little work installing a show in a gallery.
           He's an electrician. I was supposed to be
           there an hour ago.

She looks at the bugspray drawing on the floor.GINA (CONT'D)Ohh, that's nice.

Jean kisses her neck as she looks at the drawing.

We HOLD on the drawing.INT. MARY BOONE GALLERY - DAYWhite dust sprinkles down onto Jean's face from the ceiling.
Unable to use his hands, he tries to blow the dust out of his
eyes...

His boss, GREG, a mild-mannered hippie electrician, works above
him on the ladder. Jean steadies the ladder. Greg's head is out
of frame.

The gallery is an impressive space under preparations for an
opening.GREGJean, could you get me a Phillips
           screwdriver?BASQUIATA what?GREGA Phillips head. From the toolbox.BASQUIATYeah.

Jean searches through the toolbox. He picks up a screwdriver and
reads the handle: "CRAFTSMAN"BASQUIAT (CONT'D)'Phillips head,' right?GREGYeah.

Jean shakes his head and puts it back. He tries a couple more -
they each say "CRAFTSMAN." He puts them back.

Finally, he finds one with a different handle. It says "G.S.C.2000."BASQUIATYou don't have any!!!GREGThat's impossible. I've got, like, five of
              'em!

A GROUP of people arrives.

Albert Milo    comes into view, tailed closely by Rene Ricard and
MARY BOONE    - well dressed, petite, intense, 30. Milo, (also about
30), wears    casual clothes splattered with paint. Mary Boone is
engaged in    conversation with Milo. Rene chatters away.

Greg climbs back up the ladder. He holds a piece of wire down to
Jean. Jean stares at the group while trying to be invisible.RENEI need to make a call, Mary. You don't
              mind, do you?MARY BOONECertainly not. You can use my line.

                  distracted)
           You'll get there. But it's good to have
           something to fall back on. That's why I
           became an electrician. It pays the rent.
           Y'know, I'm an artist, too.BASQUIATI didn't know.GREGI sculpt. I'm really just starting to find
           myself. How old are you? Twenty? You're
           just like I used to be. I'm forty-one. And
           I'm glad I haven't gotten any recognition.
           It gave me time to develop.

Jean watches Mary and Milo talking.MARY BOONE(to Milo)
           I can't tell you how happy I am with this

Mary yells across the room to Jean.MARY BOONE (CONT'D)(her tone impersonal)

out without turning around.

Milo smiles to himself.EXT. BOONE GALLERY - ALBERT MILO OPENING - DUSKThe ART WORLD CROWD fills the gallery. Jean lurks across the
street, watching through the window.

Cabs and limousines line the block. A crowd outside blocks the
street.

Jean's obviously impressed, jealous and estranged -     he feels
entitled to all this.

He crosses the street to get a closer look.THROUGH THE WINDOWHe sees Albert Milo    talking with ANDY WARHOL and BRUNO
BISCHOFBERGER. Andy,    of course, is thin, silver-haired, and
nearly albino. Bruno    is a Swiss art dealer in his 40's. He exudes
money - a pillar of    security.

On the other side of the room, Rene Ricard is surrounded by a
coterie of young, mostly BLACK AND HISPANIC MALES. Rene looks
drunk, enjoying the moment, holding court.

Rene crosses to Albert and Andy.

People pass by.

Jean starts to walk.

About half a block away, he sprays on a wall:"THE WHOLE LIVERY LINE BOW LIKE THIS WITH THE BIG MONEY ALLCRUSHED INTO THESE FEET"He looks pleased. He turns and looks up West Broadway beyond the

hairstyle. Now the dreadlocks stand straight up from his head.

Benny dribbles with skill while Jean puffs furiously on a
cigarette. He doesn't look like he's slept, but he's happy.

Benny throws the ball to Jean. It bounces off a puddle and
splashes Jean.BENNYCome on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette.

           confused. Then, once you're famous, you
           have to keep doing it the same way, even
           after it's boring - unless you want people
           to really get mad at you - which they will
           anyway.

           "Fuck that, I'm a MAN" and he challenges
           the machine to a race to lay down a mile of
           track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the
           whole time. They get right to the end, and

sound is turned off and a record player PLAYS Gypsy music loudly.

Rolled up in a large drop cloth, Gina is asleep on the floor.
Next to her, Jean works on all fours, drawing figures, crowns,
and houses.

Working feverishly, he writes "HEY, HEY, HEY" in big clusters,
then writes other words: SHARK, IMMORTALITY, JOHN THE REVELATOR,
FAME, INK, TEETH, HAWAII SUPERMARKET, POLE STAR, BABOON and TAR.

He has an acoustics manual and Bible open    on the floor. He copies
the technical blueprints from the manual.    He reads the Bible,
following the text with a dirty finger. It    seems that he watches
TV, draws, listens to the music and reads    at the same time.

He mixes Liquitex paints and puts some colors on the drawings. He
draws a long blue line and carries it over onto the floor. Up the
wall. Through the fridge. Across the window.

He takes off his paint-covered clothes and changes into Gina's
black slip. He rummages around the room, gathering pieces of his
and Gina's clothes.

He spreads the clothes on the floor, and selecting wide brushes
with long bristles, picks up the cans of Liquitex paint.

When paint spills on the clothes, he spreads it into shapes.

Gina wakes up. She reaches for one of the painted shirts.GINA(in disbelief)

painted hair.

She shakes him harder. His body is totally limp.

Jean finds a discarded window frame in a pile of trash and
carries it with him.

They sit down on a stoop. Jean rolls up a dollar bill, empties
the dope onto the window, and splits it into two lines. He hands
the rolled up bill to Benny, who snorts the line.

Benny shakes his head involuntarily, making a violent face, as
though the dope burned a hole in his sinus.BENNYWe got beat.BASQUIATFor real?

Jean takes a taste with his finger... He tastes his tongue and
makes a face..

They continue onwards. Jean still carries the window.BENNYYou gonna carry that around all night?BASQUIATYeah... I'll paint on it.INT. PARTY - NIGHTThe party's winding down - hip-hop kids, Lower East Side types.
Jean and Benny pass through the room, ignoring the two or three
clusters of people - maybe fifteen in all...

Jean encounters a familiar face: an enormous red-haired dealer -
ROCKETS (35). They greet each other as friends.

Rockets leads Jean aside. They stand near a wall where a painting
hangs ("Flats Fixed"). It bears Jean's three-point crown.ROCKETSYou did that, didn't you?

Jean shrugs.BASQUIATI gave it to Maripol. She let me stay here
             for awhile.

Jean hands him twenty dollars. Rockets hands him two dime bags.
As if thinking better, he hands the bill back to Jean.ROCKETSDo one for me and it's free. How's that?

Jean re-pockets his money. He gestures to Rockets as if to say
"fine - it's a deal."

He and Benny sit down across the room and split a bag onto the
window, as before. This time, it's good. They lean back into it,
slumping down into the couch.

Nearby, Rene sits on a couch with THREE STREET KIDS - artists
(who we've seen at Milo's opening). They sit on their knees
looking out a window passing binoculars back and forth.

his paintings.

Gina arrives. She looks great.BASQUIATYou look fucking beautiful, beautiful.GINAWell thanks!

ANNINA NOSEI, a sophisticated, well-groomed woman appears at
Jean's side. She takes in his paintings.

As Jean, Rene, and Annina talk, Gina is left out.RENEThis is Jean Michel, whose work I told you
           about.ANNINA NOSEI(to Jean)

Jean sees Bruno and turns his back to her.

Bruno looks at the paintings with a smile... He gives a cheerful
nod to Annina.BRUNOYou're doing well.

He leaves. Annina's impressed that Jean knows Bruno.ANNINA NOSEII'd love to see some more of your work...
           Where's your studio?BASQUIATYou name it, I paint there.ANNINA NOSEIWell, I don't want to get mugged on a

Gina's asleep.INT. GINA'S APARTMENT (KITCHEN) - LATER (NIGHT)Quietly, Jean kneels on the floor of the kitchen. He paints on an
old window.

He draws figures of three people sitting at a table - obviously a
family. He crosses out one person and paints a dog under the
table.

He crosses everything out.

He mixes the paint in a large bowl and starts again.

Again, he crosses everything out.INT - GINA'S APARTMENT - MORNINGJean continues to work. He's wearing pajamas and a bathrobe.

Jean paints out the image.

There's a KNOCK at the door.GINAWho is it?ANNINA NOSEI (O.S)Annina Nosei.GINAWho?

Jean jumps up and locks himself in the bathroom. Gina goes to the
door, unlocks the chain, and looks out.GINA (CONT'D)(through the crack)

She opens the door.ANNINA NOSEIIs Jean Michel here?GINANo.

Closed in the bathroom, Jean smiles while eavesdropping.ANNINA NOSEII'm here to see some work.

Annina starts noticing all the work around her. Gina hands her a
stack of drawings.ANNINA NOSEI (CONT'D)These are great.GINAAren't they?ANNINA NOSEIHow much for these five?GINAYou should talk to him about this.

           together?

We see Jean in the bathroom looking at himself in the mirror with
a bird's nest on his head.ANNINA NOSEI (CONT'D)I'm interested in showing Jean's work.GINAI really think you should talk to him about
           this.

Jean pops out of the bathroom.BASQUIATWhen?ANNINA NOSEIHow about right now?

The cab stops for a red light. Benny gets out. He doesn't say a
word. Jean doesn't look at him. The cab sails off.EXT. ANNINA NOSEI GALLERY - DAYIt stops in front of the gallery. From outside, we see Annina

Jean looks around him. He's in a large, empty cement-floored room
lit by fluorescent lights.INT. BASEMENT, ANNINA'S - (LATER) - DAYJean bends over, beginning several canvases. He pours paint on
them - kind of like photographs we've seen of Jackson Pollock. We
HEAR Miles Davis' "Flamenco Sketches."INT - BASEMENT, ANNINA'S - DAY (LATER)GRANDMASTER FLASH'S "WHITE LINES" fills the room.

The walls are covered with half-finished, unstretched CANVASES.
Two or three more lie on the floor.

He works like a maniac, buzzing back and forth from one painting
to another, adding figures, crossing out words, all the while
smoking and eating cookies. The crumbs fall onto the paintings.
He walks on them.

Every so often, he refers to a book of DaVinci drawings. Torn
pages litter the floor beneath the book.

We hear someone THUMPING down the stairs.

It's Rene. A PUPPY follows him.

He dumps a huge load of paint supplies, art books, and carryout
ribs. The puppy sniffs around happily, licking at Jean and
walking over the paintings, wagging his tail.

He stops the tape player and inserts some Persian music.

Jean empties some foil-wrapped bags of coke. He cuts a line of
coke on a foil plate.

Rene starts reading from a poem he's evidently written:RENE3rd night I called    him 'boy'
           He sed "don't call    me 'boy'" "Well
           Then don't call me    'Boss'" That
           Was the end for us    and I've
           Been seeing him for    2 1/2 years.

Jean warms the plate 'til the coke crackles, and then "chases the
dragon," sucking the smoke through a straw.

He offers it to Rene, who refuses. He lights and hands Rene the
joint. Rene takes a hit. Jean takes it back.

Jean starts to work again.

The PUPPY runs around, chasing after him, getting in his way,
running across the paintings. Jean laughs, playing tag. The puppy
gets a hold of Jean's sleeve. It unravels about ten feet.

While Jean's playing, Rene spots a painting with the words
"Famous Negro Athletes."RENEOh man! That's one looks famous already.

Without hearing him, Jean walks towards the painting and with a
swipe, paints out what Rene is pointing to.RENE (CONT'D)You are a willful boy. How'm I s'posed to
           write about you if you keep changing
           everything?

limitless energy. Rene closes his eyes.BLACKINT. ANNINA'S BASEMENT - LATERJean is bent over his work. He looks to see a pair of legs. They

As she speaks, Jean squirms. He grabs a banana from a fruit bowl.
Without peeling it, he takes a big bite. And another. And
another. Everyone looks uncomfortable. Annina starts showing them

something to Gina.

           wife....and my parents. Mom, Dad, this is
           Jean Michel Basquiat.

Jean pulls out a joint and lights it as if it were a cigarette.
He offers it to Albert, who takes a hit.ESTHER MILO(frowning at her son)
           Don't do that.

Everyone laughs.BRUNO(to Jean)
           I'd like to do a show with you.

                  painting)
           I'm especially interested in that one. I'd
           like to buy it for myself.Jean spots the very word on the painting ("Rene 5:11") and
freezes for a second.BASQUIATI wasn't gonna sell this one.

He looks around the room for Rene, but doesn't see him. Bruno
remains smiling, waiting for an answer.BRUNOYou shouldn't have put it in the show. This
           is the one I absolutely have to have. I
           really love it.BASQUIATSure, ok..

Jean wants out. He feels compromised.BASQUIAT (CONT'D)Do you think I could borrow your limousine?
           I'll get it back to you in an hour.BRUNOIt's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner
           at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there.ANDY WARHOLBye, Jean.

Jean makes his way through the crowd, as we see images of the
crowd and fragments of paintings. As he nears the door, he feels
his arm pulled.RENE(hissing)

           ladder of success, don't kick out the
           rungs! Believe that shit.BASQUIATI'll make you another one.RENEForget it.

He pulls out a scrap of paper and starts writing.BASQUIATRene -

Rene shushes him... He hisses loudly, like a cat.RENESHHHHHH. Later.
                  (speaking to himself)
           "What is it about art, anyway......"

Jean pauses. He turns around and surveys the room once more.A blink.

Silence.

We see the crowd in SLOW MOTION.

Everyone's eyes are shut.RENE (O.S.; CONT'D)... that we give it so much importance?
           Artists are respected by the poor because
           what they do is an honest way to get out of
           the slum using one's sheer self as the
           medium. The money earned is proof pure and
           simple of the value of that individual...
           The Artist.INT. / EXT. GALLERY - NIGHTThe CAMERA rises higher and higher over the crowd and follows
Jean as he makes his way toward the street.

We begin to DISSOLVE into a MONTAGE of stills of ARTISTS:RENE (O.S.CONT'D)The picture a mother's son does in jail
           hangs on her wall as proof that beauty is
           possible even in the most wretched. And
           this is a much different idea than the
           fancier notion that art is a scam and a
           rip-off. But you could never explain to
           someone who uses God's gift to enslave that
           you have used God's gift to be free."EXT. STREET - NIGHTJean enters a waiting limo. It pulls away from the curb.

Rene finishes as the limo threads its way through the night-lit,
twinkling city.INT. LIMO - NIGHTThe DRIVER is the young Rasta we saw earlier outside Ballato's
driving Bruno and Andy.

Jean slumps in the back seat.

The driver can't help staring in the rearview mirror.DRIVERI really... admire you.BASQUIATMe? Why?DRIVERYou did it! You made it. I'm a painter,
           too.BASQUIATThat's great.DRIVERWould you check out my studio some time?BASQUIATSure. I'd be glad to.

The limo pulls over.DRIVERHere?

Quickly, Jean gets out of the limo. He leaves the door open.

The DRIVER watches as Jean talks to two DRUG DEALERS.

Jean jumps back into the limo.

The driver pulls away. In the rearview mirror, he sees Jean
separate a bag from a bundle of ten. He rips it open and snorts
directly from it.

He lays his head back and takes a deep breath.BASQUIAT(calm, relieved)

room is split level with a mezzanine reserved for celebrities and
special friends of the owner.

At the podium, the MAITRE'D approaches.MAITRE'DGood evening.

From behind the Maitre'd on the mezzanine we see Bruno waving to
Jean.

In the dining room on the lower level sit Annina and Rene.
Nearby, at another, smaller table, are seated DAVID MCDERMOTT and
PETER MCGOUGH, two artists dressed in Victorian attire.

Annina beckons him.

Rene looks away from him and talks to a WAITER. Jean waves toAnnina and continues towards Bruno's table.

Seated at a large table are Andy, Bruno, Albert Milo, his wife
and parents, Henry Geldzahler, MELINA PORTOS (a young heiress)
and FRANCESCO and ALBA CLEMENTE and Mary Boone. Dinner's already
served.

At the large table, everyone watches as Milo makes a portrait of
Francesco in a beautiful leatherbound book. It belongs to Mr.
Chow, who is nearby at the bar.ANDY WARHOLHi, Jean.

He motions to Mr. Chow to set a chair for Jean between Mary Boone
and himself.BRUNOJean, everyone loved your show.

As Jean is seated, Andy and Jack Milo resume conversation -JACK MILONixon lives in Saddle River, New York.ANDY WARHOLSaddle River's in New Jersey.JACK MILOSaddle River, New York!ANDY WARHOLIt's in New Jersey.JACK MILONew York.ANDY WARHOLI think it's in New Jersey.JACK MILOIt's in New York.ANDY WARHOLOh, I didn't know that.

CLOSE UP: Jean smiles at Andy's diplomacy.

Albert finishes drawing his portrait: it's Francesco with his arm
around a headless torso.ALBERT MILO(to Francesco)
           You finish it.

He pushes the book across the table.

Francesco begins to draw.MARY BOONE(to Jean)I hear your show was sold out already.
           There's a very important collector who's
           interested in some of your works.BASQUIATBring him over sometime. I have some other
           stuff to show him.

Annina watches from the other table as Jean talks to Mary.

Francesco finishes his drawing.

Albert takes the book and passes it to Jean.ALBERT MILO (CONT'D)Go on, take it..

Jean takes it. Mr. Chow watches his book change hands.

Jean takes a bowl of moo-shoo pork in front of him and dumps it
onto the book. Then he uses a piece of pork to draw a head.

Suddenly, there's a shrill, familiar voice.RENEI'd like a glass of your best champagne,

           It's a present to my friends. It's my
           birthday.Jean finishes his drawing - a big beautiful head that fills the
screen.

Rene grabs it from him. He holds it up for everyone to see.RENEIsn't he great? Thanks, Jean.

He rips the page from the book.RENE (CONT'D)He owes me one.

Everyone's face drops. Mr. Chow grabs his book. He motions to a
couple WAITERS -MR. CHOWYou're too much, Rene. Get this guy out of
           here.RENEI haven't eaten yet!!!

The waiters grab Rene's arms.RENE (CONT'D)Hands off me, you faggots! I'm going. I'm
           going...I've kept Diana Vreeland waiting
           too long, anyway.ANDY WARHOLWow... That was a nice drawing, too, Jean.
           Maybe you should do another one.MR. CHOW(exhausted)
           Some other time.

Spontaneously, David McDermott climbs onto the tabletop
downstairs and sings "Paris Je T'aime."

As he belts it out in a theatrical falsetto, he glides over
glasses and plates, executing a leap to another table in mid-
song.

The restaurant staff and OTHER DINNER GUESTS watch, agape.CLOSE UP - DAVID'S SHOES.As David dances, Annina walks over to the table, greeting people
and saying goodnight.ANNINA NOSEI(to Jean)
           It's great that people are interested, but

his eyes and smiles.SUPER OVER HIS FACE: "FOUR YEARS LATER"SCREEN GOES BLACKINTERVIEWER (O.S.)... had twenty-three one man shows, been in

Jean looks out the window, yawns and rubs his eyes. He now sports
dreadlocks bundled into groups of spikes sticking out of his
head. He wears a wrinkled Wesleyan College T-shirt, paint-

           make it. When I got rich, everyone said,
           `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now
           everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I
           clean up, and then they say `Look. His
           art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway.
           I'm healthy now.

Jean obliterates Andy's logo.ANDY WARHOLIf you say so. You sleep until 5:00 p.m.

           show up anywhere on time - if you show up.

Jean quits painting.BASQUIATAfter the show we should take a nice long

wooden plank suspended by chains for a bench. A candle on the
wall.

A small, crowned prince (the boy seen in the dream in intro.)
looks longingly out the window at rolling green hills. Terraced
hillsides, cedar trees, cottages, smoke wafting up from chimneys.
Dirt streets.

The prince smashes the window. He hits his head on the bars,
gripping them tightly.EXT. MEDIEVAL VILLAGE' - DAYThe villagers cease their activities as they listen to the SOUND.
Looking up, they smile, as if warmed to their souls by some
unearthly and intangible substance. They look heavenwards.

CAMERA follows their collective gaze skywards.

We shoot up, up, into the sky.BASQUIAT (O.S.)There was this little prince with a magic
           crown. An evil warlock kidnapped him,
           locked him in a cell in a huge tower and
           took away his voice. There was a window
           made of bars. The prince would smash his
           head against the bars hoping that someone
           would hear the sound and find him. The
           crown made the most beautiful sound that
           anyone ever heard. You could hear the
           ringing for miles. It was so beautiful,
           that people wanted to grab the air. They
           never found the prince. He never got out of
           the room. But the sound he made filled
           everything up with beauty.BASQUIAT (O.S)It's definitely time to get out of here.EXT. WEST BROADWAY - DAYWe rush down, down through the sky.
