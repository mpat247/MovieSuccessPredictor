          sign reads: TONIGHT - TREASURES OF PRE-CHRISTIAN EUROPE.
          A SHADOWY FIGURE lurks in an alley near the corner. His
          features are hidden by a broad-brimmed hat. He watches as-
          The guests present gleaming, golden invitations to the
          security people at the door.SHADOWY FIGURE(in Elvish, subtitled)

          He addresses WINK, an eight-foot tall TROLL with grey skin
          and a huge scar over his left, empty, eye socket. His right
          hand is missing and he sports a heavy IRON MACE instead. A
          plume of breath escapes from his brutish mouth.SHADOWY FIGURE (CONT'D)And remember Wink-(BEAT)Don't be shy.

          heads down -4 INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT 4-a darkened corridor where other STEWARDS wheel auction lots
          to and from the sales room.
          The STEWARD notices an open window at the end of the
          corridor. He leans out and looks down. Ten stories below - a
          snow-covered alley.

          wooden branches, crushing him. They grow and grow until they
          crack the ceiling!!
          Soon the Auctioneer disappears, and in its place stands a
          compact, twisted tree. Tiny creatures emerge from its
          branches and crawl around the trunk.
          CRASH!!!!! Four SECURITY GUARDS come flying through the side
          doors and land in the aisles with a THUD!!! The spectators
          scream.
          WINK walks in. He carries two large IRON BOXES on his back.
          On the sides of the boxes A ROYAL SEAL, embossed in the
          metal.
          People cower in the corners, SCREAMING in terror and

          playing on the aquarium's underwater speakers. Floating in
          warm water on a cloud of bubbles is ABE SAPIEN, lost in the
          music.
          A blurry figure approaches and raps a ring finger against
          the tank: It's TOM MANNING, chief FBI liaison to the BPRD.
          Looking dyspeptic, he presses a folder against the glass:TOP SECRET.MANNINGHey, Fishstick- We gotta talk.$ INT. FREAK CORRIDOR - NIGHT 8As they walk down the hall, manning shows Abe.MANNINGLook at that- Each photo costs a fortune
          to suppress. And then, naturally, they
          pop up on the net.
          CAMERA moves in on Abe's breathing apparatus. It's sleek,
          more modern, fitting snugly to his gills and neck. His
          goggles are new, too.
          He examines a photo of Hellboy bounding down a city street,
          brandishing his mighty, high-caliber Samaritan. He's looking
          straight at the camera lens.BELLBOY 2 6ABEOh, Lord- He's smiling in this one.MANNINGI know- It's not just the money. It's the
          provocation. This is asking for trouble.

          in together- Good days and bad.
          On cue, the concrete wall explodes!'.! A massive BALL OF FIRE
          swings the final steel door open, almost tearing it off its
          hinges.ABE (CONT'D)Then again, there are the really bad days-
          Manning and Abe cower behind a pillar. Once the explosion
          dies away- Hellboy's revealed, lying on the floor, his back
          smoking and in flames.HELLBOYOh, hi Blue- Manning-
          He puts out a small flame on his forearm and steps into the

          Tight-lipped and grumpy, Liz dons black army pants and a
          leather jacket. She jams an automatic handgun into her
          utility belt.
          They move into a vast garage, big as a stadium. It houses a
          fleet of planes, cars, boats, helicopters and tanks.
          They load weapons and ammo on board their usual
          transport/mobile quarters - a GARBAGE TRUCK.

          to work.
          MARBLE gasps and drops his gun. Dozens of creatures emerge
          from the crack on the wall and crawl into Marble's clothing.

          dozens of creatures onto the walls.
          Every blast, however, reveals a buzzing, hungry mass pouring

          Guard 2 is cleaning his gun.GUARD 2And what's with his forehead? Is that
          goggles?
          He looks out the window and sees the THE SHADOWY FIGURE
          standing by the gates.GUARD 2 (CONT'D)Hey, we got us a wino.
           He grabs his nightstick and steps outside.3535 EXT. RAILYARD - NIGHTWaving his nightstick, Guard 2 approaches the intruder.
          Their elongated shadows loom up above them on a brick wall.GUARD 2Hey- buddy- get the-
          The THE SHADOWY FIGURE whirls and drops his coat. He
          unsheathes a long, thin sword, slicing the air around the
          guard.
          The guard's shadow in the background is cut into three parts
          and collapses.3636 INT. GUARD SHACK - NIGHTGuard 1 tunes in a game show. Looks outside-
          -no sign of his buddy. Behind him, at the window, WINK
          appears. Its MASSIVE ARM punches through the wall and hauls
          off the GUARD and then slams his massive IRON MACE down!!!BAMMKM ! ! ! !THE SHADOWY FIGURE wipes off his sword over the crumpled
          remains of Guard 2. Screams and bone crunching can be heard.
          WINK emerges from behind the shack.HELLBOY 2 19Effortlessly, the SHADOWY FIGURE vaults the chainlink fence
          and walks into the roundhouse. WINK smashes the fence and
          follows him through.37 INT. ROUNDHOUSE - NIGHT 37A few pigeons flutter through a forest of steel pillars.
          Radiant fingers of moonlight shine on the old train tracks.
          THE SHADOWY FIGURE and WINK stop as a dozen ROYAL GUARDS in
          helmets and light armor march out from a tunnel.
          After a pause, a CHAMBERLAIN joins them. He bows low in a
          show of respect for the Shadowy Figure.CHAMBERLAINPrince Nuada- He awaits you- Please,
          follow me, Sire.38 INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT 38The Chamberlain leads the way down a tunnel lined with more
          guards. The armed men surround the Prince as they stop at an
          intersection.
          The Prince prepares to unsheathe his sword- WINK growls.CHAMBERLAINI beg you, your majesty. Before entering
          the chamber you surrender your sword.PRINCEI will not.CHAMBERLAINThen, I regret to say, you may not see
          your father. It is the protocol, sire.
          For peasant and prince alike. Please- for
          the last time- surrender your sword.
          A tense beat and then the Prince relents.
          The guards accept his weapon, carefully pat him down-PRINCEMr. Wink however- cannot dispose of his
          weapon. He will wait here-
          WINK snorts as the Prince is finally escorted through a
          huge, rusting iron door.HELLBOY 2 2039 INT. MACHINE SHOP - NIGHT 39An abandoned machine shop functions as a council chamber.
          High-ranking heads of outlandish MAGICK FAMILIES are there:
          goblins, trolls, dwarves and elves.
          At the center sits KING BALOR The One-armed King of Elfland
          and, behind him, the willowy, beautiful PRINCESS NUALA, the
          Prince's sister.
          Both on the King's chest and her own, a large golden piece
          dangles from a chain.
          Nuala's resemblance to the Prince is uncanny, down to the
          fine scars marring their perfect faces. They're YING and
          YANG, almost the same being.
          The Prince eyes the doors closing behind him. The armed
          guards watch his every move.
          He bows his head and kneels.PRINCEFather.

          His voice trembles with anger.KING (CONT'D)Why? !
          The Prince looks at him, defiant.PRINCEI have returned from exile to set us
          free. All of us, Father- And to reclaim
          what has been taken from our people. The
          land and the freedom that is rightfully
          ours.KINGNo- You have broken a truce that has
          lasted for centuries.HELLBOY 2 21PRINCEA shameful truce, worth nothing. How can
          you abide it? How- ? They have no respect
          for themselves, their Gods or the earth-(BEAT)And they scorn us- every time they raise
          a dead, cold building, destroy a forest,
          or take more land-
          The PRINCESS then steps forward.PRINCESSWhat they do is in their nature. We must
          honor our side of the agreement-PRINCEHonor-?(BEAT)Look at this place. Is this where you
          hold court??(BEAT )Is this how we are to live?? Amidst their
          filth, in their rubble??? Picking at

          honor in that??KINGAnd what would your solution be-? War?
          Why?(PAUSE)It may just be that our days are ended...PRINCEIt may be- but we will not go quiet. We
          will not fade like this. Better to burn
          than fade away... And for this...
          Prince Nuada looks around, locking eyes with the heads of
          the clans.PRINCE.we'll need the help of the Good... the
          Bad... and the Worst-
          He brings out the gold artifact from the auction. Holds it
          high.
          The crowds GASPS. The King instinctively covers the
          companion piece hanging from his chest as a medallion.KINGNo- you cannot be that mad-HELLBOY 2 22PRINCEYes. I am.KINGThis is the path you wish to take?
          Knowing the cost?PRINCEYes, Father- it is.
          The King takes the Princess' hand and mournfully lowers his
          head.KINGThen, I am sorry my son- you leave me no
          choice.
          (looks at his guards)
          Death.
          His two PRAETORIAN GUARDS unsheathe their swords.PRINCE(GRIM)I agree. Death it is-
          And the guards turn toward the king and stab him. The
          Princess screams. The Prince looks away as the old monarch
          tumbles from his throne, dead. The heads of the clans try to
          flee, but are kept at bay by the other guards.PRINCEHear me all!!! There are some amongst you
          that have already seen the light-
          (he nears the guards)
          Seen the future...
          The PRAETORIAN GUARDS cover his back as he leans forward to
          his Father"s corpse and snatches the medallion.PRINCE (CONT'D)As for you- You may join us in our quest
          or die now-
          His gaze is fierce, inspired. He joins the pieces together,
          they fuse and interconnect through the magical equivalent of
          NANOTECHNOLOGY. Minute gears and hooks join the pieces
          seamlessly into an almost complete CROWN. The Prince raisesIT-PRINCE (CONT'D)All of those in favor, make it known.HELLBOY 2 23All of the family heads sheepishly bow their heads, then

          it's always been...(BEAT)And now, my sister-
          The Prince looks around and sees that his sister is gone.
          He pushes through the mob, pulling his guards to the door.PRINCE (CONT'D)Find her- Find her-
           His minions surge into the tunnels.40 TNT. TUNNEL MAZE - NIGHT 40Clutching the medallion on her chest , the Princess runs
          down a tunnel. A CROWD gathers behind her, chasing her as
          she zig-zags from tunnel to tunnel.
          With perfect calm, she ducks into a niche, then slides down
          a chute.
          She lands in a stone chamber lined with bookshelves.41 INT. PRINCESS CHAMBER - DAY 41The Princess rushes to a small cabinet. She grabs an
          ancient, leather-bound tome.
          She turns to leave, but a horde of TROLLS rushes and quickly
          surrounds her. One of the beasts swings a heavy, rusty
          sword.
          It opens a gash in the princess' left arm-42 INT. TUNNEL 1 - DAY 42The Prince, rushing through the tunnel with the PRAETORIAN
          GUARDS, suddenly doubles over, cursing. Blood pours from a

          YRDRIG, a hellhound the size of a tank, jumps out from an
          alcove. He has multiple heads, all of them ferocious. In
          seconds, he's upon the TROLLS.
          Each of his many mouths tears into green flesh, lifting and
          shaking the helpless monsters like rag dolls.
          The Princess slips through a secret door.44 INT. TUNNEL 2 -- SAME 44The Prince and his guards rush through the tunnels, as troll
          screams echo off the walls.
          When they finally-45 INT. PRINCESS CHAMBER - SAME 45-reach the Princess' chamber, it's too late.
          Dead and dying TROLLS lie in a heap on the floor.
          The Prince finds no sign of his sister. He clutches his
          bleeding arm.CUT TO:46 INT. HELLBOY'S ROOM - DAY 46Liz sprawls on a sofa, watching the 20-odd TV monitors in
          Hellboy's room. All the news channels feature footage of
          Heliboy's "outing" the night before.
          HB is grinning at the camera. Now he's signing an autograph!HELLBOY ON TVYes- yes- I'd say I am that strong- I've

          JOHANN KRAUS: about 6' tall, dressed in a canvas containment

          narrow alleys and foetid vapour.
          Trolls scavenge the crumbling, marble shoreline, picking
          through garbage, scattering vermin.
          Muddy water trickles down from above, forming cloudy
          puddles.
          Roaming vendors hawk exotic objects from every culture and
          century.
          At kiosks and shops, Trolls peddle cats (skinned or alive)
          cadres of Lovecraftian entities stroll about: Mer-men,
          Goblins and a few select species unknown to any cosmology.
          A dogfight of sorts is taking place in a small ring. Instead
          of pitbulls, multi-limbed creatures leap at one another
          while violent bettors laugh and shout.
          At the rail, Abe watches in horror, then sees a woman in
          rags making her way through the crowd. He catches a glimpse
          of her slippered feet...

          stays outside, watching through a window as she negotiates
          to purchase a silver and crystal CYLINDER contained in a
          safety holding case.
          The SALESMAN denies it at first but after the Princess hands
          him a gold bracelet he finally acquiesces while vowing to

          hands it to her.

          army.77 INT. BLACKSMITH FURNACES - DUSK 77Lit by the fires of a hundred furnaces, stoked by scores of
          goblins, a MECHANICAL ARMY is born. Metal plates and moving
          parts are hammered into shape on enormous anvils and bolted
          onto tall, ornate, golden figures.PRINCESS (V.0.)This was an army that would not eat,

          battle axes, bludgeons and lances.PRINCESS (V.0.)But this army knew no bounds, had no
          remorse, felt no loyalty, engaging in
          blind battle with man, woman or child.
          The horde crushes everything, with swords slicing through
          armor as if it were paper. Every blow is deadly, precise.
          The army marches ever onward, like a grinding machine
          devouring tender flesh.
          At length, there is no sign of life in the human camp.PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D)And as the king gazed upon the earth
          awash in blood and at the impassive metal
          faces of the army he had created, his
          heart grew heavy. Victory was gained at
          too high a price. This war should never
          have been waged.
          The King surveys the carnage. The mechanical soldiers stand
          in symmetrical ranks awaiting further instructions.PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D)And so he arranged a truce: the surviving
          men would keep to their cities and we
          children of the Earth would dwell within
          the forests. This pact, he declared,
          would be honored by our sons and the sons
          of their sons until the end of time.
          Listening to his father, Prince Nuada reacts with anguish.PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D)But my brother did not believe in the
          promises of men. He marched off into

          They're lost in unfamiliar alleys and byways. Until-JOHANN(finally, pointing)
          There. Stairs to the street...BUT-PRINCEHold!
          The Prince appears at the top of the stairs, dressed in
          black. He's surrounded by his elite guard. Stepping to the
          rail, he points at his sister and addresses the crowd:PRINCEHear me, o creatures of the forest! Can
          you recognize a traitor? She's here to
          betray her own!
          He casts a disdainful look at Hellboy.PRINCEI'm here to recruit all of you against
          the humans. Make your decision now. Those
          who join me will be rewarded. The rest...
          will be killed.
          A sudden silence falls over the throng. Then, the sound of
          CRACKING KNUCKLES. Everyone looks at Hellboy, who is
          unclenching his fists and stretching his neck.
          He starts up the stairs, but a couple of the GUARDS leap
          down to block his path.HELLBOYI'm gonna put this as delicately as I
          can.CUT TO:HELLBOY 2 538484 INT. BOWLING ALLEY - SAMEA crowded BOWLING ALLEY is full of serious-looking players
          in colorful shirts and shoes.
          Someone rolls a ball down the center lane, and as it speeds
          right at the pins...BOWLERLook out, Manny! Strike city..!
          CRASH! Hellboy erupts from under the floorboards, fighting
          the clawing monsters right behind him!
          As the bowlers freeze in shock, dozens of creatures pour out
          into the human world. Grunting, Hellboy punches his way
          free, only to be dragged back by the tail by WINK.
          Abe, shielding the Princess, demonstrates the way of the
          water, a fluid martial arts display. He ducks and parries
          the blows, leaping like Nureyev.
          Abe scoops up a couple of bowling balls and rolls them at
          the Prince's guards. He manages to knock a couple off their
          feet.
          As they get back up, he uses the available bowling pins as
          clubs. The screaming PATRONS rush for the doors.8585 EXT. STREET -- CONTINUOUSOutside, the civilians flee, but the news crews come

          Liz yells out a warning... and then throws a barrage of
          flaming bolts. A pair of crab-like THINGS shrivel and burn.
          Johann melds with a heavy steel dumpster, until only his
          legs are visible beneath it. Bending at the waist - SPLAT -
          he brings it down on the head of the nearest creature!
          WINK and HB duke it out for a few beats and then HB finally
          vanquishes the Troll, Ripping his Iron Mace off and throwing
          it away.
          As the other monsters retreat...
          .the PRINCE appears: in his hand a complex mechanical
          GRENADE. Immediately worried, Abe hustles the Princess over
          to the BPRD truck.
          The Prince twists a timer. His bloodied trolls disperse,
          screaming, renewing the panic.PRINCE(to Hellboy)

          it. He's about to throw it down a sewer, when he listens to
          its clockwork innards then: PING!!!!HELLBOYIt's a dud, your royal assness - !
          The Prince has disappeared, along with his horde.HELLBOYHow do you like that? Just when I was
          loosening up.
          Then... CLACKK!!!.
          Hellboy scrutinizes the grenade as it opens up like a
          beans.
          flower... and spews out a handful of Brightly coloredABEPick them up!!HELLBOYAbe. relax- It's jumping beans...
          Abe is scrambling to retrieve them.ABEDo as I say!
          With a sigh, Hellboy scoops up a few.ABEHow many do you have?HELLBOYThree, how about you?ABEThree! There's always seven! Find the
          last one!!!TOThe seventh bean is next to a manhole. It hops closer
          edge...ABEQuick, it's going for water!
          Hellboy reaches for it... but it's too late. The thing hops
          into the manhole and lands somewhere below with a SPLASH.ABE (CONT'D)Oh, my God, evacuate the area!HELLBOY 2 56HELLBOYAbe, please, get a grip.
          A RUMBLE from below their feet. WHAMMMM!
          A HUGE TREE punches up through the pavement, overturning
          cars, knocking buildings off their foundations and ripping
          up through the Bridge overpass!!
          Picking up speed, the tree branches soar up, up, up... into
          the moonlit clouds.
          Hellboy approaches the massive, trunk, gazing up in
          fascination. Birds and creatures emerge from the inside and
          flutter around, grass overtakes pavement- and for a moment
          Chinatown looks like the Garden of Eden.HELLBOY (CONT'D)Whoa. Just like the story books.
          Manning and Liz take a few steps into it: a SQUIRREL-BEING
          climbs on Liz's shoulder and a couple of IRIDESCENT
          HUMMINGBIRDS fly around her "ala" SNOW WHITE. A small crowd
          starts wandering into this idyllic scenario.LIZThis is so beautiful-MANNINGSo- perfect- so peaceful-HELLBOYHey!!!
          He spots. the prince, at the base of the tree. Knocking on it-HELLBOYHey- Jhonny Apleseed- What are you-?? Oh-

          Liz starts pulling Manning away and yelling at the crowd-LIZBack- Go back- right now!!!MANNINGWhat? What? What is he doing-?LIZHe's knocking on wood- summoning anELEMENTAL-HELLBOY 2 57MANNINGAn elem-LIZA forest spirit that lives in that tree.
          He's releasing it-MANNINGOh, and is it that bad??
          KKKRRRRCHTCH!!!!! The tree trunk rumbles and shakes under
          some enormous force. Huge LEAVES tumble to the street. Even
          the ever-present NEWS CREWS back away as a huge shape
          descends.
          BOOM!! the trunk rips in two, revealing a curled, dormantELEMENTAL.Five stories high- Fierce as nature. THE ELEMENTAL steps out
          of the tree and stares at Hellboy.
          Uttering a weird, guttural SOUND, the Giant raises an arm
          and pulverizes a GASOLINE TRUCK!
          WHUMP- ! Flames leap up! The Elemental grins with delight,
          turning his baleful gaze on the Princess. As she shrinks
          back, her pet Yrdrig rushes at the thing, snarling. In a
          single leap, it sinks its teeth into the Elemental's heel.HELLBOYGood dog.
          (to Elemental)
          Now, Woody... You want to fight someone,
          you fight with me.
          Hellboy humorously adopts a kung fu pose, as in Bruce Lee.
          The Elemental hops forward, New branches sprout from his
          limbs, shaking the Yrdrig off.ABE(to the Princess)
          This may not be the best place for you,
          your majesty. With your permission...
          He offers the Princess his arm. She takes it and allows Abe
          to lead her away. A moment later, the Elemental smashes the
          ground where they had been standing!
          Every time the ELEMENTAL moves, he trails behind roots and
          branches. The roots connecting to its feet and leading to
          the original tree trunk, like an umbilical cord.
          Johann sees this-HELLBOY 2 58JOHANNI have a plan-
          He looks at Abe-87 STANDING AT THE GARBAGE TRUCK 87-as the fishman helps the Princess up into the rear of the
          BPRD garbage truck.
          Up front, behind the wheel, Liz starts the engine.88 ABANDONED BUILDING88Hellboy climbs a fire escape as the Elemental's arm/branches
          extend and grow over the ladder, pulling it down below his
          feet. Hellboy ducks into one of the open windows as the
          Elemental tears away the rest of the scaffolding. Growing
          and discarding branches and roots.89 INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 89Hellboy runs like a cockroach through a dilapidated KITCHEN.
          Behind him, the Elemental's massive BRANCH/FIST crashes
          through the wall, then pursues him as he runs down a
          corridor littered with debris.
          Like a wrecking ball, the Elemental demolishes each section
          of the corridor as Hellboy runs.90 EXT. LEDGE - CONTINUOUS 90Hellboy steps out onto a ledge ten stories up, just out of
          reach of the Elemental.HELLBOY(to the Elemental)
          What now, Big Boy? You get a ladder?
          The Elemental jumps up and down, trying to reach him,
          barking in frustration.
          Hellboy's RADIO crackles:ABE(on the radio)
          HB? This is Blue. The Princess is fine.HELLBOY 2 59HELLBOYSo what?JOHANNSo, lead him to the bridge.
          Hellboy looks over the buildings and sees the Brooklyn
          Bridge in the distance.HELLBOYThat's nine blocks from here, Fishbowl!ABEYou'll figure it out.HELLBOYWhat's at the bridge? Abe - ? Liz?
          Hello???
          No answer. Muttering, Hellboy climbs higher, up a buzzing
          neon sign reading "Hotel".
          The Elemental smashes the letters "tel"... so Hellboy climbs
          the "0" to the roof.91 INT. GARBAGE TRUCK - SAME 91Liz drives the garbage truck toward the Brooklyn Bridge.
          Johann is sitting next to her.92 EXT. ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS 92Hellboy makes a running start and leaps off the building. He
          sails over the alley, reaches for the approaching cornice...
          and almost loses his grip! He hangs on for dear life.
          Behind him, the Elemental appears, climbing onto an adjacent
          roof. As his feet smash through the skylights, the Elemental
          pulls down a WATER TOWER. A wall of water rolls toward
          Hellboy, like an ocean wave!
          Hellboy leaps to the next roof... and the water shoots over
          the edge of the building, cascading onto the street below.93 EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - SAME 93Liz parks the truck near the Brooklyn Bridge. Using
          binoculars, Abe peers out the back doors to see Hellboy
          bringing the Elemental closer.HELLBOY 2 60ABEJohann - they're almost here.
          Johann moves among massive construction machinery. He stops
          at a stack of heavy SPOOLS OF CABLE.
          Abe comes running, pointing at the cable.ABEYes. I had the very same idea...
          He gets behind the levers and handles of a complex machine
          which holds a half mile of steel cable.ABE(gazing at the controls)
          .but how do you operate this??JOHANNIf you'll permit me...
          Johann opens his fingers, and plunges both arms deep into
          the mechanism! Instantly, the diesel engine STARTS UP.JOHANN(to Abe)
          Stand back, Abe.
          A hydraulic strut lifts the spool, then pitches it through
          the air, spinning off 300 yards of cable. It splashes down
          near the far shore of the East River.JOHANNNow, tie it onto the pontoons on the
          other side.
          (seeing Hellboy coming)
          Quickly, Abe!94 IN THE WATER 94Abe races down a pier and dives smartly into the dark water.
          Then he surfaces, surging dolphin-like toward the Manhattan
          shore.95 BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DOCKS 95Hellboy makes it to the bridge... as, behind him, the
          Elemental wades into the river, pushing aside boats and
          barges.HELLBOY 2 619696 IN THE RIVERAbe makes it to the other side, surfacing with the cable,
          towing it to a half-submerged pontoon.JOHANN (CONT'D)(on the radio)
          Macht schnell! Abe - make it fast!
          The cable is a yard short of the anchor point! Abe tugs onIT-ABEI need more!JOHANNNo more available!
          The Elemental's feet stomp through the river; he stumbles as
          he encounters the submerged cable.9797 UNDERWATERClinging to the cable, Abe is dragged down, down down...
          past rusting cars, oil drums... and a couple of rotting
          CORPSES, their feet in tubs of cement!
          Suddenly, Abe's head strikes a sunken truck, knocking him
          unconscious. Blood seeps from his wound.9898 AT THE BRIDGEAs Hellboy climbs one of the bridge towers, he hears someone
          calling out from above:PRINCE(to Hellboy)
          Haven't you managed to kill it yet? You,
          who were so eager for a fight?
          The Prince is standing on top of the tower. He points at
          Hellboy, then yells at the Elemental.PRINCE(to the Elemental)
          Over here, dear friend...
          SNATCH! The Elemental plucks Hellboy off a parapet! Hellboy
          wriggles in the massive wooden finger-like appendages.HELLBOY 2 62The Prince walks to the edge of the tower, near a steel
          spire, his coat flapping in the night wind.PRINCEThis might be a good chance for you to
          come to your senses. Help us.HELLBOYI've been all through this! The answer's
          still no!
          Far below, Johann slips his right arm into the cable,
          bringing it to life, whipping it back and forth, like a
          steel snake!
          The cable forms a huge loop, splashing down near the
          Elemental and tightening around his ankles. The cableTENSES-JOHANN(to Liz)
          Burn the roots!!! Burn them!!i
          He points at the roots trailing into the river. Liz
          concentrates and a bolt of fierce white-hot energy pours out
          of her hands, burning the roots at the Elemental's feet.
          Johann gyrates; the cable responds, whipping up out of the
          river! With a bellow, the Elemental loses his balance; he
          tosses Hellboy high into the air.
          On the way down, Hellboy grabs a support stay and swings
          back and forth like a red monkey. He lands atop of the
          Elemental's back, right behind his head.HELLBOYNap time, Big guy-
          He raises his stone fist and hits him straight in the back
          of the neck.
          The cable tenses-
          -The Elemental pitches forward-
          The Prince looks up to see the Elemental falling right at
          him; his mouth opens as if to scream...
          The Elemental goes down, impaling himself on a spire atop
          the bridge... exactly where the Prince had been standing.
          Putting an end, it seems, to both of them.HELLBOY 2 63The Creature dies, but even as it does, its branches embrace
          the steel structure and grow, Ultimately, blocks and blocks
          of the city are now covered in trees and grass and mossy
          leaves... A strangely beatific and precious change.
          Liz runs up, looking out at the river as Abe emerges,
          bleeding, but alive. Abe, Liz and Johann embrace firmly,
          laughing and happy to be together.
          Abe eyes the Princess standing nearby, smiling back at
          him...
          Hellboy meanwhile observes the group from a distance,
          jealous, alone.CUT TO:99 INT. FIRING RANGE - LATER 99BLAM! BLAM! Deafening shots as Hellboy blasts the Samaritan
          again and again at a target in the dark firing range. Hits a
          button, brings the paper close for inspection.
          Result: a very ragged, loose pattern around the bull's eye.
          Suddenly, from the next alley, RAPID GUNFIRE. Johann leans
          over, and to address Hellboy through a cloud of gunsmoke.JOHANNYou'll permit a small criticism? You take
          too much time to aim, to think. Nein.
          Just point- like afinger- as if you wish
          for something.HELLBOYOh, I wish for something.
          Johann brings his target close: a beautiful, tight cluster
          of shots, dead center.JOHANNSpeed is of the essence. You must work on
          it. I'm willing to spend some -
          Johann reaches for his loader, accidentally knocks Heliboy's

          don't like it.HELLBOY 2 64JOHANNOn the contrary.100 INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY 100Hellboy's in the shower, glaring across the room, where

          shatters!HELLBOYSlow enough for ya-??
          With a loud HISSS, Johann's odd suit sags to the floor!HELLBOYOw- Johann... buddy. Sorry- I- I- got

          An ectoplasmic TENDRIL reaches out from the suit and

          The vaporous form of Johann's body emerges from the lockers
          and wanders away. The locker room doors open and close as he
          goes by.

          in seconds, a squad of TROLLS pulls itself into view! WINK
          leers at the Princess. From her waistband, she produces a
          long, thin DAGGER and wields it timidly.
          Somewhere in the building, ALARMS start clanging.
          The Yrdrig shakes himself into action and springs.
          With a SNARL, it attaches its several jaws onto the nearest
          trolls. As the fighting creatures crash into the spiral
          staircase, the Princess hears a familiar voice:PRINCEHold.
          The Prince steps into the room, carrying a long spear.
          The trolls are on top of the Yrdrig, ready to kill him.PRINCECome-!
          The trolls release the Yrdrig and bound over to the Prince.
          The last troll, however, grabs the Yrdrig by the neck and
          brutally twists -!
          The animal's three mouths yelp and cough, fighting for air.

           parking garage. Manning and Hellboy jump out of their
           vehicle and see -HELLBOY 2 85- a couple of dead AGENTS sprawled on the loading dock.MANNINGWhat in God's name- ?
          Hellboy, Abe, Liz and Johann race past him, disappearing
          into the building. The alarm bells are deafening.128 INT. BPRD CORRIDOR 128Hellboy leads the way down the corridors, which are alive
          with scrambling personnel. Several BPRD employees are lying
          on the floor, wounded and confused.129 INT. LOBBY 129The top-level human agents are clustered in the lobby, their
          guns drawn, all of them aiming at the Prince and his
          drooling bodyguards. Standoff.
          As Hellboy and the team arrive, Abe sees the Princess, her
          arms tied. Her brother holds her by the hair.ABEPrincess!
          Without thinking, he darts forward. Instantly, one of the
          trolls swipes at him, its claws just missing his chest-HELLBOYAbe! No, get back!!
          Abe regains his balance and tries again, his eyes glued to
          the desperate features of the beautiful young woman. Hellboy
          manages to restrain him.PRINCESSMr. Sapien, don't! He'll kill you!PRINCEI'll kill you all, if that's what you
          want.HELLBOYNo. Why don't you just start with me?

          Five-fingered Mary.
          In the background, Manning arrives, wide-eyed. Just in time
          to see the Prince hand off his captive to one of the trolls.
          He drops back, flips his spear to horizontal and waits for
          Hellboy's attack.130130 FIGHTHellboy feints left, goes right and whips around, swinging
          his tail at the Prince. The Prince leaps and jabs with the
          spear, poking a hole in Hellboy's coat.
          The surrounding crowd backs away as the combatants circle
          each other. The Prince is nimble. The Prince is quick. He
          thrusts the spear again and again, driving Hellboy into a
          display case full of antique weapons.
          The glass breaks and a number of swords and axes fall to the
          floor.JOHANN(to Hellboy)
          Arm yourself! Use the flail!.HELLBOYNot my style. Watch and learn, fish bowl.
          He punches the Prince, hard. The blow knocks the Prince to
          his knees; as he rises, Hellboy connects with a brutal
          combination.
          In the arms of the troll, the Princess' head rockets back
          and forth, as if struck. A moan of pain escapes from her
          lips.ABE(seeing this)
          H.B., no! Stop - you mustn't harm him!
          As the Prince totters, Hellboy turns to look at Abe,
          momentarily distracted- Then-HELLBOY 2 87Hellboy grimaces and looks down: the Prince's SPEAR TIP is
          half-buried in his chest...!
          The Prince sneers and gives the spear a savage yank,
          breaking off the blade! Hellboy's eyes roll upward; Liz
          SCREAMS. She and Johann manage to catch Hellboy as he
          collapses.
          The Prince reclaims the Princess and turns to the humans.
          His eyes seek out Abe, who has rushed to Hellboy's side.PRINCE(showing off the Princess)
          If you want to see her again, you'll give

          Abe, in surgical goggles, probes the wound.
          In CLOSE-UP, Abe's webbed fingers lightly touch the glinting
          metal that protrudes from Hellboy's sternum. The spear tip
          responds, as if alive; it wriggles, producing a GROAN fromHB.Liz is near panic.LIZAbe, stop studying! Pull the friggin'

          of his tank.
          He goes directly to one of the book stands, which lies in
          pieces on the floor. He comes up with his copy of "Jane
          Eyre."
          He opens it to Chapter 23 and finds the gold piece.LIZAny luck?
          Liz has come in behind him. Abe quickly palms the precious

          seems useless-(BEAT)Now the case itself proves very useful-
          He moistens the holding cylinder case on a rubber stamp mat
          and imprints the surface pattern on the paper map. Glyphs
          and coordinates become visible.
          A silhouette of a twisted, gnarly tree is visible too.ABERenvyle it is- Both the Princess and her

          tunnels. Here and there, the walls are pierced, allowing
          light and ocean waves to enter.
          Rounding a few corners, the Prince stops near a wall
          decorated with a large, elaborate FRESCO. It shows a

          Johann reaches the tree and inspects it carefully.JOHANNAbe, bring the mapcase over here.
          He's found a roundish SLOT in the tree, where the lowest

          Renvyle is over there.
          They glance up and down the beach, looking for a boat.
          Hellboy blinks and sniffs the air.
          A GOBLIN speaks up from an outcropping of rocks in the
          shallows directly in front of them. By his side, sitting
          atop of a tree: A SATYR and a CROW observe the group.GOBLINI bid you welcome, strangers. Would you

          The Goblin heaves on an oar and emerges from behind the
          rocks. He's standing in the stern of a sturdy little
          coracle. Its wooden hull is painted in Celtic patterns.GOBLINRoom enough for all of you!

          the Goblin rows them to the opposite shore and docks near a
          cove.
          The Goblin leads the way as Liz, Abe and Johann arrive and
          help Hellboy up.HELLBOY 2 98Strange BIRDS hang upside down form the Cave's roof. A
          MASSIVE CHIMNEY has been carved out of the cave's rock at
          the other end. A Black, ancient figure is hunched there,
          warming its skeletal hands by the fire.
          A raspy voice utters something in an ancient language. The
          Goblin replies, gesturing at Hellboy, who collapses on the
          floor.
          In a deep coma, Hellboy lies on the floor, near the
          crackling fireplace. The ANGEL OF DEATH extends its FOUR
          BLACK WINGS and a thin, jagged smile appears in its pale,
          eyeless face.ANGEL OF DEATHSo. This one... The boy- I remember him

          It studies the speartip, which has buried itself deep in
          Hellboy's flesh.ANGEL OF DEATH (CONT'D)I warn you: it is his destiny to rule

          Abe and Johann exchange a silent, worried look.ANGEL OF DEATHVery well, then- but let it be said: The

          world much sorrow.LIZAnd I'll deal with it when that time
          comes. Now save him.
          The creature cackles and then grips the spear tip with the
          tongs. A cry of pain from Hellboy as it withdraws the bloody
          point from his chest.HELLBOY 2 99The ANGEL OF DEATH holds up the speartip and looks at it
          with distaste.ANGEL OF DEATHHarmless now.

          and down, pointing at the speartip.JOHANNOur ferry captain - he wants his
          payment...ANGEL OF DEATHAch, outside with you!
          She tosses the speartip to the creature, who scoops it up
          and bounds out the door.
          instantly, the goblins and birds leap down and crowd around
          him, chattering in excitement over the latest prize.
          She gazes down at Hellboy, whose yellow eyes are fixed on
          her. He smiles wanly.CUT TO:153 EXT.. HILLTOP - DAY 153Alone on a hilltop, Abe surveys the coastline. Through the
          binoculars, he discerns a SECOND CAVE half-hidden behind
          wild, breaking waves.
          Glancing back at ANGEL OF DEATH's cave, Johann strikes off
          on his own, headed for the cave.154 EXT. HUT - DAY 154Outside ANGEL OF DEATH's hut, a bandaged HB is sitting up,

          Before she can go on, Johann appears. He carries a poultice
          and fresh rags.BELLBOY 2 101JOHANNAbe and I have found the entrance to the
          Golden Army's resting place- Liz come

          You should stay behind and get some rest-HELLBOYAnd call you in the morning, right?? Like
          Hell I will. I'm keeping an eye on you,GLASSHOLE-CUT TO:155155 EXT. HILLS - DAYJohann, Liz and Hellboy follow a rugged trail along a bluff
          high over the sea. Johann refers to the map, then points to
          the cave opening a half-mile ahead. Abe is standing there,WAVING-JOHANNThere.
          Abe points at the violent sea below-ABEThe only way in- I'm afraid we'll have to
          jump in-
          (looks at Hellboy)
          Can you make it-?
          Hellboy nods.BELLBOYStrange. If this is the entrance-ABEI know- Why isn't there more security??
          With a ROAR, WINK!!!!! - jumps out and throws a CHAIN around
          Bellboy's neck!
          The chain is connected to his IRON MACE which now dangles
          around Hellboy's neck.
          The two creatures battle each other fiercely. WINK's MACE
          destroys a nearby tree, like a wrecking ball and it connects
          twice with Hellboy's head.
          But Red gets the upper hand quickly, snapping the chain in
          two and twirling the mace like a boleador.HELLBOY 2 102He hits Wink again and again-HELLBOYSee?? It hurts!!! It hurts!!!
          Hellboy grips the chain, pulls the creature close, then,
          like a weightlifter, raises him high overhead. With a mighty
          GRUNT, Hellboy tosses him overboard. WINK hits the jagged
          rocks once- twice- thrice-HELLBOYOuch- ouch- ouch-

          We better go swimming before any more
          ugly fellas show up-
          He stares down into the swirling waters and discreetly takes
          his hand to his bandaged side: He's bleeding. The wound has
          re-opened.ABERed, are you-?HELLBOYDon't say a word, Blue- Let's move on-156156 UNDERWATERJohann plunges in from above, his body quickly tumbled by
          the rough seas. A moment later, Liz and Hellboy are in the
          water, too.
          Johann swims down, leading them into the darkness of the
          cave entrance.157 INT. CAVE ENTRANCE - SAME 157As they bob up for air, they find there's only a few inches
          of breathing room between the sea and the rocky ceiling. Liz
          starts coughing.JOHANNHang on, people. I'll be right back.158158 UNDERWATERJohann dives down to find a rusting, iron LOCK six feet
          under the surface. He tries to turn the control wheel, but
          can't make it budge.BELLBOY 2 103Seconds later, Hellboy is at his side, gripping the wheel in
          his huge hands. Using all his strength, Hellboy finally
          manages to turn it.
          His bandage, however, floats free... and his wound opens up,
          emitting a plume of blood.
          Lungs bursting, he shoots to the surface. Johann stays
          behind and swings open the lock, revealing...159 A STAIRWELL 159.carved from the living rock, leading upward into the
          depths of the cliff.CUT TO:160 STAIRS - LATER 160The trio cautiously climbs the stairs, finding their way
          with light sticks. Hellboy stops to lean against the wall.
          He dabs at his chest with a rag.LIZ(to Johann)
          Hold up. We need to rest.HELLBOYSays who? I'm fine, I tell ya.
          He lurches forward, pushing past the others, fighting off
          his pain.LIZ(to Johann)
          This was a mistake. He's -JOHANNMein Gott--
          The stairs lead to-161 INT. CAVERN 161-a vast underground arena where a thousand torches are
          flickering.
          CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal rank upon rank of GOLDEN
          SOLDIERS. Immobile. Silent. Waiting.HELLBOY 2 104162 AMONG THE SOLDIERS 162Hellboy leads the way down a row of gleaming statues,
          pausing to gaze up at the blank face of one of the
          infantrymen.HELLBOYHey, amigo. You got some gum?
          Two rows away, Johann examines the lethal weaponry that
          terminates the arms of each soldier.JOHANNMost ingenious. A versatile, highly
          mobile killing machine.LIZMake that machines, Johann. I see more
          than one.
          Hellboy taps on a soldier's mechanical chest, which booms
          faintly, sending ECHOES up into the dark cavern.HELLBOYWow. You hear that? Listen -
          He thumps it, harder. The mechanical thing rocks
          backwards...HELLBOYUh oh.
          CRASH!!! The thing falls onto the soldier behind it! Then,-the ear-shattering noise of a hundred car wrecks builds as
          - a toppling LINE OF SOLDIERS races away like falling
          dominoes!!HELLBOYWhoops.
          The sound dwindles, then builds again as ANOTHER LINE of
          falling soldiers bears down on them!!
           Liz screams and Hellboy pulls her aside. The soldiers crash
          past them until -
          - the din suddenly stops. The PRINCE stands revealed at the
          head of the column.HELLBOY 2 105PRINCEAs a boy, they say I enjoyed toy
          soldiers. So do you, I see.
          He strolls past the mechanical figures, pausing to kick
          aside some of the weapons.PRINCE(to Hellboy)
          You're bleeding. Most unfortunate.
          Hellboy wipes at his oozing chest wound.HELLBOYYeah. Now it's your turn.PRINCEDo you envy these contraptions? They
          never bleed. They feel nothing. Not even
          the zest of combat.
          The Prince circles them, keeping an eye on Johann.PRINCEThese fighting men are the very model of
          patience... merely awaiting word from
          their lawful commander.ASFrom his tunic, he brings forth two of the gold segments.
          he fits them together...PRINCEYou have the remaining piece, I presume.JOHANNWe do not -PRINCE(SURPRISED)Then you are most foolish.
          He gestures to some troll GUARDS near a tunnel entrance.
          They lead the Princess out in chains.PRINCE (CONT'D)You came here expecting what? Mercy?JOHANNThe death you would unleash will never
          happen! What you need is far from here
          and will stay out of your reach forever.HELLBOY 2 106A VOICE reaches their ears from the tunnel entrance behind
          them.ABEStop - I have it.
          Abe, dripping wet, stands there, the last gold segment in
          the palm of his hand.ABE(APPROACHING)Here... For her... Take it...JOHANNOh, my God. What has he done?
          Keeping his eyes on the Princess, Abe gives the gold piece
          to the Prince.
          Hellboy steps forward, feeling dizzy and betrayed.HELLBOYAbe -ABE(to Hellboy)
          You cannot fight him- not without hurting
          her...(BEAT )What would you do if it was Liz??
          CLICK! The Prince fits the gold parts together and places
          the resulting crown on his head!PRINCEI am Prince Nuada and I command my army
          to life once more. Does anyone dispute my
          right?
          With the deep sound of gears, ratchets and springs, the army
          comes to life. Up comes the lances and shields.PRINCE (CONT'D)(points at the team)
          Kill them.
          Abe is now aghast, seeing the Prince drag his sister back.ABE(to the Prince)
          That was your price!! A ransom, you said -
          paid in good faith!!(MORE)HELLBOY 2 107ABE(continued)
           (to Hellboy)
          Why, he lied to us!HELLBOYAbe old buddy. If we survive this, we
          need to talk.
          The Army swings into action, marching toward them. The four
          friends retreat, soon pressed against one of the walls.ABEHe - he's a cad! Can you imagine, a
          highborn heir to the throne, last in a
          noble line of-BELLBOYNot now, Abe, okay?
          The first phalanx of golden soldiers is upon them, their
          terrifying weapons slashing in unison. Hellboy brings out
          his huge gun and starts firing as Johann grabs a torch and
          swings it like a club.
          A couple of the mechanical soldiers go down, only to pop
          back onto their feet, new weapons blossoming on their arms.LIZLet me -
          Liz summons up a white-hot burst of electrical fire in each
          hand. With a yell, she unleashes a searing EXPLOSION at the
          oncoming fighters.
          The shock wave rolls through the enemy ranks, flattening
          scores of soldiers. For a moment, the BPRD team regains
          hope... but the endless lines of mechanicals keep coming,
          marching on and over their scorched comrades.
          Hellboy holsters the Samaritan and rushes forward, giving it
          his best. His wound is running with fresh blood.
          He punches a soldier, whose mace pounds repeatedly against
          his ravaged chest; as blood spatters his face, Hellboy
          groans and keeps fighting, to absolutely no effect.
          At length, the mechanical arms throw Hellboy against the
          wall, where he collapses, unable to carry on.JOHANNInvincibility!? So - the only one thing
          may stop them -
          Johann unzips his suit; with a HISSS, his ectoplasmic self
          flows out, into the body of the nearest mechanical soldier!HELLBOY 2 108Instantly, the thing whirls on its companions and starts
          chopping! Bits and pieces of gold machinery fly about as
          Johann rips into the enemy!!
          But again, fresh metal soldiers fill in for the fallen. As
          the BPRD team watches in dismay, Johann's mechanical shell
          is surrounded by the other SOLDIERS, who methodically
          dismember it like marauding insects!
          As the parts drop to the floor, twitching and useless,
          Johann slithers out and re-inhabits his suit.JOHANNAch. They are too many. Anyone have
          another idea?
          Hellboy grabs the nearest sword and hauls himself to his
          feet.HELLBOY(a bellow)
          Prince Nuada: I challenge your right to
          command this army!
          With a soft BOOM, the clockwork troops come to a halt! All
          the mechanical heads turn toward the Prince, who stands on a
          ledge with his sister.ABE(follows HB)
          No= please- no-
          Hellboy moves away from him.HELLBOYA challenge must be answered! Raise your
          sword!PRINCEA challenge from you? A nobody?? You are
          no one.PRINCESSNo!! He is Anung-un-Rma- son of the
          Fallen one- He has the right!
          Her eyes lock with Abe's: there's no other way.
          The Prince sees Hellboy coming and with a bitter smile picks
          up his sword.HELLBOY 2 10 9PRINCEVery well.
          (to the BPRD team)
          May his fate show you the cost of pride
          and blindness.
          As the hall rings with their first blows of their swords-JOHANNHellboy's too weak-
          Summoning up his last ounce of strength, Hellboy manages to
          drive the Prince back into the center of the arena, where
          they fight under the inscrutable gaze of the golden army.
          Every time Hellboy gets a clean shot at the Prince, Abe
          looks at him, pleading, and HB has no choice but to keep
          parrying off his enemy.
          Hellboy's sword grows heavy in his hands; he stares at it in
          dismay as it trembles. His muscles can no longer respond.
          The Prince is ready to kill him.LIZ(witness to a nightmare)
          No!! NO! !
          A sudden movement at the ledge, where the Princess steps
          forward and...
          Using her concealed DAGGER, she STABS HERSELF in the right
          arm!! In silent slow motion, she drops the dagger.
          Instantly, the Prince drops his arm... his hands come away
          red with blood. He looks over at his sister.
          They share a hard look of mutual understanding. Love and
          hatred.
          Hellboy raises, through supreme effort, bleeding. He quickly
          raises his sword. The fight resumes, but this time, HB has
          the advantage.
          He fights bravely and after parrying fiercely with the
          Prince, he disarms him and points his sword at his chest.HELLBOYI- have- won-PRINCENo. You have not-HELLBOY 2 110He impales himself on HELLBOY's sword. The blade goes
          through his abdomen and protrudes on the other side. Hellboy
          pulls it out, but it's too late. Both the Prince and the
          Princess collapse to the ground, mortally wounded.ABE(GASPS)NO-Abe hurries to the Princess. Takes her into his arms,
          blinking in despair.
          The pale young creature is now a ghostly white. She lifts
          her eyes to Abe's, caressing his thin, scaly face.PRINCESSWe'll find each other again, somewhere.
          And she dies in his arms.
          In the center of the arena:PRINCE(to Hellboy)
          You... think you're any different from
          me? The humans - they will tire of you.
          They will disappoint you. And in the end,
          they will betray you. You... are living a
          lie. Your time will come again. May you
          make a better choice.
          Then, he, too, is dead. Both him and his sister turn to
          fine, pale dust. And the wind carries away the ashes from
          Abe's hands...
          Shaken, Hellboy lifts the crown from the Prince's head.
          Looks at it carefully, as if considering the possibilities.
          Suddenly, he rips it into pieces. As he crushes the first
          segement...
          . an entire division of the golden army collapses into a
          heap of scrap metal!
          Hellboy does the same with a second section of the crown and
          another massive division of the army tumbles into junk!
          HB is about the tear up the last segment of the crown, when
          it explodes in his hands!
          WHUMP! The last of the army disintegrates.
          Hellboy confronts the Prince's frightened troll guards:HELLBOY 2 111HELLBOY(to the trolls)
          You - and your kind! Leave here. And stay
          in the shadows - where you belong.
          As the ogres slink back into the tunnels, Liz looks at
          Hellboy. He seems angry, stung by the Prince's last words.DISSOLVE:163163 EXT. HILLS - DAYThe BPRD team crosses waterfalls and stone bridges, through
          the magical hills.

          world now.
          Johann turns the cylinder. The tree roots form their arch...
          and the BPRD team walks through.165165 EXT. RENVYLE - DAYOn the other side of the tree: Manning and a bunch of agents
          have set up spotter scopes and are gazing out over the
          countryside, looking for them.
          Suddenly, the team appears, literally from out of nowhere.MANNING(STARTLED)Whoa! Where'd you come from? We were just-BELLBOYI know, here to help. Well, I appreciate
          that Manning.HELLBOY 2 112Abe steps past Hellboy and removes his gunbelt and equipment
          pack.ABEYes, Mr. Manning. I want to thank you,
          too. For all you've done for us over the
          years.
          He gives his stuff to the astonished agent.MANNINGWhat? What, exactly is this?ABE(walking away)
          I quit.
          Hellboy glances at Abe, then hauls out the Samaritan and
          shrugs off his pack, too.MANNINGCome on. You're resigning?HELLBOYLooks that way, doesn't it?
          Hellboy starts to leave, but spins around and takes his gun
          back.HELLBOY (CONT'D)I think I'll keep this.
          He finally meets Liz's gaze. She crosses to him and takes
          him by the arm. She walks off with Hellboy and Abe, clinging
          tightly to the big, red daemon.MANNINGLiz -- not you, too!?
