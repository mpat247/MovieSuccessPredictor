	A SMALL DOOR swings open.
	A circle of light reveals that we I re looking down the 
	length of a tube. At the far end of the tube, we see a 
	gloved hand dangling a rat. The hand shoves the 
	frightened rat into the tube and closes the door behind 
	it. The rat s stark white fur bristles and it begins to 
	pad down the tube s length.
	After several feet, the tube opens up into a dimly lit 
	cubicle. The rat hesitates and stops.
	The SOUNDS of gentle BREATHING whispers in the rat s 
	ears.
	The rat turns round to head back down the tube, but a 
	door swings shut, trapping it in the cubicle.
	The rat cowers as the BREATHING turns to SNORTING.
	The rat s head jerks around, looking for signs of danger, 
	but the cubicle is empty. The rat sees a water dish on 
	the far side of the cubicle - a place to hide - and 
	dashes toward it.
	But an invisible force descends.
	The rat squeals in agony as something smashes down on its 
	body, crushing it.
	A LOUD BELLOW rings out, and the rat flies into the air, 
	halting a few feet off the ground. Its body writhes, 
	struggling against the unholy force.
	Then a sick crunch of tiny bones snapping. All life 
	quickly drains from the levitating body. Dead eyes...
	The creature s corpse floats in mid-air. Then the white 
	fur of the rat explodes in a shower of blood.
	HUGE BLOOD SMEARED INCISORS appear, as do the red-slicked 
	ape- like lips. The gaping bloody mouth bites again into 
	the rat.CUT TO:INT. BEDROOM - NIGHTIn the background we hear Jay Leno s monologue from the 
	Tonight Show. A small lamp and the glow from a computer 
	screen illuminates SEBASTIAN CAINE, late twenties with 
	the shabby good looks of a perpetual grad-student. Wiry 
	framed and wearing only boxer shorts, Sebastian sips 
	coffee from an  Einstein  coffee mug. He peers at a 
	complex computer rendered molecule displayed on his 
	screen. He pecks a few keys and the molecule shifts 
	slightly, then falls apart.
	Sebastian pulls a twinkie from a hostess box, unwraps the 
	cellophane and sucks it down. He attacks the keyboard 
	with renewed vigor.
	Another molecule appears on the screen. Sebastian s 
	fingers fly across the keyboard. The molecule blinks on 
	and off, it trembles and twists apart.SEBASTIANDamnit.
	Sebastian pears out his window. Across the courtyard, a 
	light comes on in a neighboring window. He sees a 
	BRUNETTE, mid-twenties, absolutely stunning, enter her 
	living room. The Brunette thumbs through the mail, tosses 
	it and then begins to undress. Sebastian loans over to 
	the window, getting interested. But when the brunette 
	reaches her bra and panties, she crosses to the window 
	and lowers her shades.
				SEBASTIAN (cont d)
			Damnit.
	Sebastian leans back in his chair and closes his eyes. 
	He s obviously tired. He opens his eyes and stares up at 
	the ceiling. Painted across the white matte finish in big 
	red letters is a brief reminder -  You Should Be 
	Working.  Sebastian sighs, leans forward and begins 
	pecking away again.LATER:The television is now only static. We pan by his alarm 
	clock. 4 am. We find Sebastian pacing in front of his 
	computer.
	He gets an idea... slides back in his chair. Types away 
	again. The molecule reforms on the computer screen.
	He types a few more keys, waits, watches the molecule. 
	Nothing happens.
	He hits a few more keys and watches intently for a 
	reaction.SEBASTIAN(beat)
			I am a goddamn genius.
	He hits a few more keys and a telephone keypad appears on 
	the screen. He dials.CUT TO:INT. ANOTHER BEDROOM - NIGHTDigital phone rings.
	In the bed, LINDA FOSTER, late twenties, stirs from a 
	deep sleep. As she straggles out of bed and over to her 
	desk, we notice a young man sleeping next to her.
	The ringing continues. She moves her computer mouse 
	around and her screen comes to life. She click on a 
	telephone icon and the ringing stops. A beat later, 
	Sebastian appears in a window on her screen.LINDASebastian, do you know what time it 
			is?SEBASTIAN (SCREEN)You know Da Vinci never slept. Said it 
			was waste of time.LINDAWhat is it this time?INTERCUT: SEBASTIAN S BEDROOMSebastian peers at the image of Linda in the computer 
	window. He notices something behind her in the bed, the 
	young man sleeping face down.SEBASTIANWho s that?
	Linda pulls the camera off the top of the of the computer 
	screen and positions it so Sebastian can t see the bed.LINDANot your business. Not anymore.SEBASTIANTouche.LINDASo you calling about anything in 
			particular, or were you just hoping to 
			catch me sleeping in the nude?SEBASTIANI cracked the reversion.
	Upon hearing this, Linda receives a jolt of adrenaline.LINDAYou cracked it?SEBASTIANLook at this. 
	Sebastian hits a couple of keys. A moment later the 
	molecular structure appears on Linda s computer.SEBASTIANWatch this.LINDAYou sure?SEBASTIAN91% sure.LINDA(astonished)
			Eleven months with no progress and you 
			suddenly come up with it out of the 
			blue? How?SEBASTIANThe usual. Coffee and twinkies.LINDAI hate you.SEBASTIANI know. You think you could hunt down 
			Matt and get to the lab early. I want 
			Isabelle prepped for a live test.LINDAYeah, I think I can find him. What are 
			you going to do?SEBASTIANWell y know. It s daylight in 
			Switzerland. I gotta call the Nobel
			Committee and tell them to get our
			prizes ready. See you in a few.
	ON LINDA S COMPUTER SCREEN as Sebastian clicks off. Linda 
	crosses to her bed, and shakes the guy awake.LINDAHey... come on.
	DR. MATTHEW KENSINGTON, late 20s too, stirs from under 
	sheets.MATT(groggy)
			What?LINDASebastian just called. We gotta get to 
			the lab.
	Matt bolts up.MATTShit! You didn t tell him I was here, 
			did you?LINDAGive me some credit, will ya.MATTSo what s the rush?LINDAHe cracked reversion.
	Matt pulls his jeans on.MATTWanna ride down?LINDAWe better take our own cars.MATTYou re gonna have to tell him about us 
			eventually.LINDAI know. It s just You re his best 
			friend. He ll feel betrayed.EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. SKYLINE - DAYFrom a distance, the Nation s Monuments stand awash in 
	the harsh light of morning.
	CAMERA finds a BLACK PORSCHE as it pulls to the security 
	fence of a warehouse. The imposing structure is 
	surrounded by a chainlink fence and barbed wire.
	The Porsche is waved through security and heads straight 
	into the warehouse.INT. WAREHOUSE -DAYThe Porsche pulls to a halt in a reserved parking space 
	and Sebastian exits, wearing a Hawaiian shirt, shorts, 
	and Birkenstocks. He notes the other cars parked in the 
	lot, then crosses to bunker in the center of the 
	warehouse, guarded by a MARINE, shouldering an M-16.MARINE GUARDMorning, sir.SEBASTIANMorning, Ed.MARINE GUARDYour team s in early. Something 
			special going on?SEBASTIANSorry, Ed. You know the rules. 
	Sebastian presses his thumb against a glass screen. A 
	laser reads his print. 
	Scan readout: CAINE, SEBASTIAN 
	Clearance:    ALPHA ALPHA THREE 
	Division:	CLASSIFIED 
	The doors whisk open and Sebastian steps inside.MARINE GUARDHave a good day, sir.INT. ELEVATOR - DAYInside the elevator is a numberless keypad. Sebastian 
	taps in his floor code.ELEVATOR (V.0.)Authorization please.SEBASTIANCaine zero zero two seven.ELEVATOR (V.0.)Authorization verified. Good morning, 
			Dr. Caine. 
	The elevator descends with a groaning hum. It passes 
	below us and keeps descending into the belly of the 
	earth, the shaft goes down forever.INT. HABITAT S CORRIDORWe slowly push down a hallway panelled by Plexiglas 
	chambers. Each chamber looks as if it s tailored for a 
	specific animal, although no animals are visible.
	As we pass one habitat, something slams into the 
	Plexiglas and begins barking. Another HOWL joins in. Then 
	SCREECHING. Suddenly the hallway fills with a dozen 
	animal cries. THUMP.THUMP.The Plexiglas on several chambers vibrates as if angry 
	animals were slamming against it. But still, no animals 
	are seen.
	Above each chamber, VIDEO SCREENS display THERMAL IMAGES 
	revealing heat signatures of the various animals, but 
	they remain invisible to the naked eye. MATT taps on a 
	sheet of Plexiglas which seals off another seemingly 
	empty cage.MATTIsabelle ...
	The woodchips on the floor shift and suddenly the 
	Plexiglas steams up right in front of Matt s face. The 
	Plexiglas begins to shake violently.
				MATT (cont d)
			Calm down baby. Calm down. It s 
			okay...
	Matt takes a pair of thermal goggles from his belt and 
	pulls them down over his eyes. 
	THERMAL POV - A rather large heat signature, ape-like in 
	shape, rattles about the cage. Matt slowly unlatches the 
	Plexiglas door and reaches inside.
				MATT (cont d)
			It s okay, baby. It s okay. I m not 
			going to hurt you. Come here.
	THERMAL POV - he reaches out to the creature. He grabs 
	hold of it, firmly. Stroking it. The creature COOS. Matt 
	reaches for a hypo and brings it up to the creature.
				MATT (cont d)
			Just hold still. 
	Something clamps down on his hand, breaking his skin. 
	Blood erupts in a bite pattern.
				MATT (cont d)
			 Ow, shit.
	Matt drops the hypo and falls back. The cage door flies 
	open and something runs out. Matt pulls himself up to see 
	the heat signature running down the hallway. He turns 
	around to see another heat signature coming at him. Matt 
	pulls off his goggles to see Linda coming up the 
	Corridor.LINDAYou okay?MATTShe bit me.LINDAYeah. She s become a lot more 
			aggressive in the last few days.
	Linda takes the goggles from Matt.
				LINDA (cont d)
			Go take care of that bite. I ll get 
			her.MATTAnd give you a chance to pull ahead? 
			Never.
	Linda opens a lock-box at the end of the hallway and 
	pulls out a two tranquilizer guns. She hands one to Matt.AROUND THE CORNERA slight distortion shimmers as something runs past us. 
	We hear HOOTS and FOOTSTEPS.
	Looking down the shadowy corridor, we hear grunting and a 
	haunting heavy breathing. The control door is closed 
	though and something large and angry is throwing itself 
	against it. We can t see anything.
	A few moments later, Linda and Matt round the corner, 
	wearing goggles and leveling their pistols.MATT(ala Porky)
			Shh. Be vewy, vewy quiet. I m hunting 
			simians.   heheheheh.LINDAKnock it off.
				 (soothing voice)
			Isabelle!
	THERMAL POV - Dark hallway. Movement. A red shimmering 
	heat signature. It comes running at Linda. HOWLING. Linda 
	fires. A T-DART flies. Thwack... It stops in mid-air. 
	Then falls. But it doesn t hit the floor. Instead, it 
	stops inches above the ground. 
	THERMAL POV - the heat signature lies in a heap at 
	Linda s feet.MATTGood shootin , Tex.LINDAWhat s that make it?MATTI m still ahead. 6 to 5.
	Like a smug gunfighter, Linda blows imaginary smoke from 
	the top of her tranquilizer gun.LINDABut I m catching up.INT. CORRIDOR - DAYThe elevator doors open and Sebastian steps out. He s met 
	by SARAH KENNEDY, early thirties, a fiery red-head.SARAHCan I have a word?SEBASTIANMost normal people say good morning.SARAHDon t you think you should test the 
			protocol on the liver samples before 
			you inject Isabelle?SEBASTIANHow many tissue samples have we 
			successfully regressed? Hundreds, 
			right? How many have gone on to work 
			on the full system? None.SARAHThat s beside the point.SEBASTIANNo, that is the point. I m not going 
			to waste six months of my life on an 
			outmoded testing procedure. This thing 
			works. I know it. I feel it.
	Linda comes down the corridor, listening in on the tail 
	end of the conversation.SARAHFine. You can mop up afterward.SEBASTIANYou think I m going to kill Isabelle?SARAHKill? More like liquefy.SEBASTIANSarah, thank you for your opinion, but 
			I m the project leader. Understand? 
	She says ...SARAHYes, Sir.
	... but somehow it feels like  Fuck you.  She storms off. 
	Sebastian turns to Linda.SEBASTIANHow did you ever convince me to hire 
			her?LINDAYou said you wanted the beat vet in 
			the country.SEBASTIANYeah, well she cares more about the 
			animals than the research.LINDAMaybe that s why she s so good.CUT TO:CLOSE ON: MATT as he shuts off the spinning cyclotron. As 
	it s spinning slows to a halt, he pops the top and 
	reaches in, removing...A GLOWING VIAL OF ORANGE LIQUID.Sebastian peers at the vial.SEBASTIANWho da Man? You da Man.MATTAs we pull out we see we are.INT. LABORATORY - DAYAlmost feels like a dungeon. Think high-tech 
	Frankenstein. Walls lined with video displays, technical 
	readouts, bizarre medical equipment.
	On a table in the middle of the room, a sheet drapes over 
	a humanoid form, strapped down at it s invisible limbs. 
	The straps move slightly... ghostly. Wires lead from the 
	body to lots of machinery.MATTProtocol is hot.SEBASTIANVitals?
	Sarah, checks over the various readouts ... heartbeat, 
	blood pressure, the rest.SARAHNormal.
	CARTER ABBEY, the late thirties lab assistant, wheels in 
	a cart of equipment. Linda taken a seat by the table and 
	pushes aside the sheet.BOOMING VOICETHIS IS GOD. YOU ARE DISTURBING THENATURAL ORDER OF THINGS AND WILL BESEVERELY PUNISHED FOR ALL ETERNITY.GOD HAS SPOKEN.SEBASTIANHow many times do I have to tell you,

	Sebastian glance up at a glass booth overlooking the 
	Laboratory floor. TWO PEOPLE in the booth.SEBASTIANYou guys ready to roll?INT. OBSERVATION BOOTHFRANK CHASE, early thirties, and tech expert JANICE 
	WALTON, early twenties, man a small booth above the lab. 
	They re dressed more like band roadies than scientists.
	The room is crammed with electronic and recording 
	equipment. A handful of monitors display different images 
	of the lab. Thermal and regular video. Another screen 
	monitors vital signs.FRANKWe are live and in color. On your 
			mark.
	Frank and Janice looks down on their colleagues. 
	Sebastian nods their way.SEBASTIANOkay. Roll  em.JANICEOkay. We are rolling record on videos

	Matt unwraps a hypodermic needle and jabs the needle into 
	the vial, drawing up the colored liquid.INT. OBSERVATION BOOTHMATTOkay.
	Frank and Janice monitor Isabelle s vitals.INT. LABORATORY - DAYTension in the air.SEBASTIAN(to Linda)
			Ready.
	She wraps a bungee cord around nothing and pulls it 
	tight. She then takes some dye and sprays it. A surface 
	appears, floating beneath the restraints. It sheens in 
	the light as Linda searches for a vein. She slaps the 
	surface several times. A small bulge appears, like a 
	vein.LINDAPropped.MATTLet s make some history.
	Matt lowers the hypo to the vein. But Sebastian takes the 
	hypo from Matt s hand.SEBASTIANNice try, Sparky.
	Matt relinquishes the needle.LINDACome on, Isabelle. You can do this. 
	Sebastian lowers the hypo. The skin bonds and gives. The 
	needle remains in sight after it slips through the 
	visible surface. Matt presses down on the hypo plunger, 
	releasing a dye into his bloodstream. The gold liquid 
	twists into a long snaking tube up and down the limb. 
	It s the shape of a vein. The liquid begins to react. 
	Small flashes of light blip up and down the strand of 
	color. Ba-bump.. ba-bump... the heartbeat starts to speed 
	up.SARAHElevated heartbeat.INT. OBSERVATION BOOTHJanice analyzes the screens.JANICEWe re still in the green.FRANKConfirmed. Vitals still in the normal

	Matt pulls the sheet back. Muscles are beginning to 
	appear. And eyeballs. Frightened eyeballs.SARAHHeart rate s up. She s scared.
	Sarah soothes her.

	Isabelle starts to struggle against her restraints. She 
	begins to howl.LINDASubject may be in pain or extreme 
			discomfort.SARAHGoddamnit. Blood pressure elevating. 
			Brain activity going through the roof. 
	The brain appears, seemingly growing from the inside out. 
	The shape of a large half-formed monkey grows from the 
	inside out. A SKULL APPEARS howling in pain, in horror.
				SARAH (cont d)
			We ve got a problem.SEBASTIANWhat? What problem!
	Sarah checks her monitors.SARAHIt s her heart. We can see the heart 
			beating in the ape sFRANK (V.0.)I got an erratic heart beat.SARAHShe s going into cardiac arrest.LINDAGot the crash cart.
	Carter charges the crash cart and rolls it in.SARAHWe re losing her.
	Her machine flatlines.SEBASTIANNo! It s got to work.
	The body is only half there. It looks as if its caught in 
	decomposition. Linda rubs the cardiac paddles together.LINDAClear!
	Linda slams the paddles on the monkey s chest. The jolt 
	of electricity makes the monkey visible again for a brief 
	moment. Then the skin and flesh fade away again.SARAHWe ve got something!
	The heartbeat starts up again. The body continues its 
	march toward,visibility.

			Still. erratic.LINDACome on Isabelle. Come on. You can do 
			it. You can fucking do it.
	Everybody s pulling for her.SARAHCome on, monkey.MATTDo it. Do it. Come on.
	Muscles spread like a rash on bone as the monkey twists 
	and turns, frightened. Then skin. The monkey howls. Skin 
	forms over the muscles reappearing like it was being 
	painted on before our eyes.SARAHStabilizing.
	The entire form glows, then blinks, then glows again, as 
	if it was discharging some stored energy.FRANK (V.0.)Brain activity returning to normal.
	The monkey grunts and groans. Blinks its eyes. Linda 
	hovers over it stroking its fur.LINDAWelcome back, Isabelle.

	the restaurant's balcony. She find Sebastian leaning 
	against a railing, breathing in the night air.SEBASTIANHey...LINDAI thought you'd gone.SEBASTIANWhere would I go?

	He looks out over the sweep of the city, the twinkling 
	lights of D.C. and darkness of the Potomac river.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Twenty years ago there were no 
			computers, no fax machines, no cell 
			phones. I was just wondering what the 
			world will be like twenty years from 
			now... if what we're doing will change 
			everything.LINDAA little "I am become death... the 
			shatterer of worlds"?SEBASTIANSomething like that.LINDASince the day I met, all you wanted to 
			do was change the world.

	She puts her hand on his shoulder.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Listen, I know we've... I mean... well 
			... I just want you to know how proud 
			I am of you. I know it probably 
			doesn't mean a lot...SEBASTIANActually it does.
				 (beat)
			I guess since you were there from the 
			beginning, you know me better than 
			anyone else on this godforsaken 
			planet.LINDAYou're positively maudlin. You should 
			be happy. Do you have any idea what 
			you've accomplished?SEBASTIANYeah... but I was working so hard, I 
			didn't realize I'd have no one to 
			share it with.

	Sebastian heads back inside. But he stops and turns back.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			I don't suppose we could turn back the 
			clock for a night and you could come 
			home with me?

	Her look says it all. Too much water under the bridge.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Right. Sorry. Too much champagne.

	He turns and heads back into the party. As he heads in he 
	passes Matt heading out. He and Sebastian exchange 
	"Heys".MATTWhat was that about?LINDANothing. It's just... He is who he is.

	Next to Sebastian a video shows a small monkey shifting 
	from the visible spectrum. It's hair, skin, organs and 
	skeletons slowly dissolve before our eyes.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Well, we found out sending them to 
			"never-never-land" was easy, it's the 
			getting back that's hard.

	Sebastian fast forwards a few moments until the video 
	screen shows the bizarrely tangled heap of flesh and bone 
	that used to be alive.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Every time we've tried to bring a test

	Sebastian pauses. Something's bothering him.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			But now...

	One of the senior advisers, DR. HARRY KRAMER, 
	distinguished 50s, finally breaks the silence.KRAMERBut now?

	Linda and Matt look up at Sebastian expectantly.SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)But now...
				 (pause)
			But now, we feel we are closer than

	Linda starts to speak, but Sebastian cuts her off with a 
	look.SEBASTIANShouldn't be more than another year, 
			Sir.

	Frustrated sighs all around the room.

			They're supposed to know.LINDAI'm sure he had a reason.
				 (firmly)
			You did have a reason, didn't you, 
			Sebastian?SEBASTIANI had more than a reason. I had a 
			goddamn epiphany.

	They reach his Porsche.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			What do you think they'd do if they 
			know we could send a subject into 
			phase shift and pull it back out 
			again? How many seconds would it take 
			for them to take over the whole 
			project, bringing in their soldiers to 
			test the formula on. We'd have lost 
			control of it by the end of the week.LINDAIt's their money, Sebastian. It's 
			going to happen eventually.SEBASTIANI know. But not yet. There's too much 
			for us to learn. I don't want my hands 
			tied by their political agenda when we 
			go to phase three.MATTWell, then... mind telling us how 
			you're gonna get a human test-subject 
			for phase three without the committee

			there are a bunch of guys who aren't 
			famous cuz they died.SEBASTIANIf we're that unsure, how can we

	something were climbing it.

	We slowly crane up the fire escape and hold on a window. 
	Through the wispy curtains and dirty glass we can see 
	Linda enter the room. The panel of glass fogs from 
	Sebastian's breath. The fog wipes away, seemingly by 
	itself.

	But then through the window we see Matt walk into the 
	living room and put his arms around Linda's waist. We 
	hear a shocked intake of air.

	He kisses her neck and then slowly unzips her dress. Her 
	dress falls to the floor. Matt takes off his sport coat 
	and drapes it over a chair, while Linda unfastens the 
	buttons of his shirt. They're laughing now, exchanging 
	kisses.

	Matt reaches behind Linda and unhooks her bra. He kisses 
	his way down her neck to her breasts. Linda pulls him to 
	her.

	Suddenly the window shatters. Startled, both Matt and 
	Linda jump back covering themselves.

	We hear Sebastian's footsteps as he retreats down the 
	fire escape.

	A moment later Matt reaches the window and peers out. He 
	sees the fire escape ladder slowly rise back up down 
	below.LINDAWhat was it?MATTI don't know. I don't see anything.

	repetitive barking that grates the soul like Chinese 
	water torture.SEBASTIAN'S VOICEBe quiet!

	A photograph of Linda drifts through the air and settles 
	atop a flaming candle. It ignites into fire, twisting and 
	turning in mid-air, then falling on the floor as ash. A 
	beat later water runs from the sink faucet. It forms in 
	the shape of hands and splashes against his face, 
	dripping away.

	The Plexiglas door to the doggie's cage swings open and

	The force squeezes its little fur ball throat until the 
	barking stops.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			Nobody's gonna hurt you. 

	The force keeps squeezing until the little doggie goes 
	limp. Then the dog smashes against the Plexiglas over and 
	over until blood spills out its mouth. The Plexiglas door 
	swings closed again and moments later the door to

	Through the glass we see LINDA and MATT seated across 
	from DR. KRAMER. We can't hear what they're saying but it 
	certainly looks serious. Kramer puffs on a pipe and 
	strokes his beard, shaking his head.

	Kramer rises and shakes hands with Linda and Matt, and 
	the three of them head toward the front door.

	Mrs. Kramer retreats back to her bedroom as Dr. Kramer 
	crosses over to the telephone. He picks up the receiver 
	and starts dialing. In the middle of dialing, the phone 
	goes dead. He clicks the hookswitch up and down trying to 
	get a dial tone. Nothing. He checks the connections on 
	the phone and then follows the wiring to the wall. The 
	line's plugged in. Weird. He hears a door creak open in 
	the kitchen.

				KRAMER (cont'd)
			Hello? Hello?

	Kramer crosses to the darkened kitchen. The kitchen door 
	leading to the backyard is open. Puzzled, he crosses to 
	it. A wind stirs across the pool and backyard, swirling 
	dead leaves in small twists of wind. The windchime rings 
	lightly. Kramer steps out.EXT. POOL/PATIO, BACKYARD - NIGHTIn the dim spillover light from house, Kramer crosses to 
	the telephone- box against the back of the house. It Is 
	open and several of the wires have been pulled. He looks 
	around, spooked and puffs out a cloud of smoke from his 
	pipe. For the briefest of instants, Sebastian's face is 
	visible in the smoke. Kramer jumps back in surprise and 
	the pipe drops from his mouth. He gives a small sharp 
	cry, but deep indentations appear across his mouth and 
	his cries are stifled. In the darkness, we can make out 
	his form writhing as if possessed. The struggle continues 
	a beat until Kramer manages to break free.KRAMERHelp! HELP! MARTHA! HELP!

	As Kramer runs, he looks behind him. But no one's there. 
	WHAM! Something slams into Kramer and he tumbles, rolling 
	into the pool. But as he hits water there's not just one 
	splash, but TWO. In the water next to him is human shaped 
	AIR-POCKET. It's Sebastian displacing the water. And 
	because of the water displacement, we can clearly see two 
	arms pushing Kramer beneath the water's surface. 

	MARTHA KRAMER opens the bedroom window and looks down at 
	the pool. All she can see is her husband drowning... his 
	flailing limbs kicking up a massive air bubble around 
	him. She races from the window. Kramer kicks and flails 
	for a few moments and then his limbs stop moving. A 
	moment later he floats to surface, face down. The AIR 
	POCKET bobs over to the pool ladder, and rising from the 
	pool, we see Sebastian's body outlined in sheets of 
	water. The shape melts away in a cascading waterfall 
	until all we can see of Sebastian are the hundreds of 
	tiny droplets still clinging to his body, caught in the 
	light like twinkling bulbs on a Christmas tree. The shape 
	disappears into the darkness. A moment later Martha

	Linda tries to get a clear shot off through the smoke. 
	Matt trips and goes sprawling. Something yelps. A howl.

	appears, still twitching.

	She starts to back away, but she's already in the corner. 
	She clutches her tranquilizer gun, but there's nothing to 
	aim at. The vials of blood on the shelf gives her an 
	idea. She reaches over, grabs a vial and throws it on the 
	floor. GLASS SHATTERS and BLOOD SMEARS across the 
	linoleum. Sarah tosses another vial and another. Becoming 
	more and more hysterical. Splattering more and more 
	blood. But she runs out of vials. Shaking with fear, she 
	searches the blood looking for a footprint, or movement. 
	But there's nothing there. Sarah waits a beat, clutching 
	the tranquilizer gun. Takes a step. Waits a beat longer.

	Finally she relaxes. It was just her imagination. She 
	heads toward the door when she hears a terrifying whisper 
	in her ear.SEBASTIAN'S VOICEYou missed.

	tries to move, but she's pinned there. Her hands

	A dart explodes from the gun and imbeds in Sarah's

	She rises, and looks outside the porthole into the room. 
	Suddenly it fogs up and she almost sees a face. She 
	stumbles backward, and the door starts rattling. Linda 
	scrambles over to hold the metal crowbar in place. 
	Sebastian pulls and rattles on the freezer door. To no 
	avail. It's not gonna budge. Finally he gives up. The 
	door stops shaking. Linda is relieved, briefly.  Still. 
	Then she hears the click of the door locking.OUTSIDE THE FREEZERCLOSE ON THE REGULATOR as the dial turns from forty-five 
	degrees, down to negative twenty.INSIDE THE FREEZERThrough the porthole, Linda sees the bloody footprints 
	heading toward the door. She removes the metal bar and

	Linda looks around the storage room. She grabs a roll of 
	duct tape and pulls off a length.MATTWhat're you doing?LINDAThis is temporary.

	She takes paper towel and cleans off Matt's wound. She 
	tapes it, using duct tape.

	A beat later, the compressor begins pumping Arctic air

	Linda returns to the door. Shakes it.INT. CHAMBER - DAYWe hear WHISTLING as we see a sheet of flesh fill out 
	into a head as Sebastian slides on his latex head piece.INT. STORAGE FREEZERLinda continues shaking the door. The lock holds. A tear 
	rolls down Linda's cheek, but a strange thing happens. 
	The tear drops freeze. Linda shivers as she pulls the icy 
	tears from her face.LINDAOh shit.

	The inside thermometer has dropped to five degrees.

	Linda grabs the metal bar and starts smashing it against 
	the porthole. The metal bar just bounces off the glass.INT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICEA drawer opens, revealing a set of clothing neatly

	Matt's head rolls back.LINDAMatt! MATT!

	She checks his pulse. Thank god he still has one, but 
	he's not gonna last long. They're both already starting 
	to turn a little blue. Linda stares desperately up at the 
	shelves, trying to find some sort of advantage. Then she 
	sees something. She looks back at the door lock and then 
	she rises ... and grabs AN EXTENSION CORD coiled on the 
	shelf.

			We're not dying in here.INT. BATHROOM - DAYSebastian, dressed in street clothes, stands before the 
	mirror applying make-up to his latex mask.INT. STORAGE FREEZERLinda finishes stripping the insulation off the electric 
	cord. 

	She grabs a hypodermic needle package, and her cold 
	fingers fumbles with the package as she tries to pull out 
	the plastic tube.

	She finally gets it out and she starts wrapping the 
	stripped electric wire around the tube in a tight coil.INT. BATHROOM - DAYSebastian slides on a wig and checks his appearance in

	he could pass as normal.INT. STORAGE FREEZERLinda furiously winds wire into a coil.INT. CORRIDORSebastian heads down the corridor. Lingering steam twists 
	in and around the hallway, long wispy tendrils. Sebastian 
	pauses for a moment, hearing A GROWL. Suddenly the 
	hallway seems a lot scarier. From beneath his scrubs he 
	pulls his own tranq gun. He listens ... hearing scraping 
	and footsteps. Watching the water on the floor twitch. 
	With machine like precision, he turns and fires. The 
	tranq dart halts in mid-air and some invisible thing 
	tumbles over.

	Sebastian continues down the hallway.INT. STORAGE FREEZERLinda holds the plug end of the extension cord. The other 
	end is wrapped into a tight long coil. Linda looks for an 
	outlet, but can't find one. She looks at the overhead 
	lights.

	A moment later she's climbing up the shelving. She wrap* 
	a piece of fabric around her hand, and with a sharp punch 
	she smashes one of the overhead light bulbs.INT. LABORATORYSebastian enters, fully dressed. At a distance it'd be 
	hard to tell his secret. He pulls several chemicals off 
	the shelves. Then he pulls a tray of test tubes over and 
	begins mixing.INT. STORAGE FREEZERLinda works on jerry rigging the two ends of the wire to 
	the lightbulb, socket. 
	Suddenly the coiled wire springs to life and flies 
	against the nearest metal surface. She's made an 
	electromagnet.INT. LABORATORYSebastian loads the filled test tubes into the 
	centrifuge. Dozens of other vials are already slotted. He 
	takes one of the left over vials, considers it a moment 
	and then flings it over to the other side of the lab. The 
	vial shatters and...EXPLODES.A powerful explosion that rocks the room.INT. STORAGE FREEZERLinda feels the rumbling as she places the coil up 
	against the door. The magnet attaches itself. Linda 
	shakes the coil, trying to get the doorlock to move.OUTSIDE THE DOOR -We see the lock twitching. Shaking...INSIDE THE DOOR -Linda shivers as she plays with the coil. Her eyes glaze 
	and she stumbles backward. Her surgical scrubs, once 
	soaked with sweat, are now frozen stiff. She composes 
	herself and pushes back toward the door. Her heavy breath 
	hangs as a low cloud of Mist.INT. LABORATORY - DAYSebastian looks over the dozens of other test tubes, 
	calculating their combined power in his mind. Then he 
	closes the top of the centrifuge. He taps a few commands 
	into its timer.INT. SUPPLY ROOMThe door lock twitches again and twists back. The door 
	swings opens and Linda stumbles out, mashing into a 
	supply shelf of oxygen canisters. The canisters tumble 
	every which way as Linda tumbles to the ground.

	She scrambles to her feet and goes in after Matt, pulling 
	his cold body out of the storage locker.

	She pulls stacks of paper down from, the shelves into a 
	trashcan, grabs an industrial lighter and ignites the 
	paper. She pushes Matt close to the small bonfire. As she 
	does, the oxygen tanks catch her eye.INT. CORRIDORSebastian exits the lab, locking the door behind him. He 
	heads down the darkened tunnel. Something scampers in 
	front of him. Small, not visible. Sebastian sends it 
	reeling with a swift violent kick.INT. CORRIDOR, BY THE ELEVATOR - DAYSebastian, dressed and in full latex, comes striding up 
	the tunnel. He taps a code into the elevator vault doors. 
	The vault doors open revealing the elevator.

	The doors slide open and Sebastian steps inside.ELEVATORAuthorization please?SEBASTIANCaine. One One One One One.ELEVATORAuthorization valid. Thank you.LINDASebastian!

	And there's Linda. Slicked with dirt and blood. She holds 
	a oxygen container with a cut line.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			I can't let you leave. Come on out and 
			I'll give you one last chance.SEBASTIANYou said it yourself, Lin. I shouldn't 
			hold on to the past.

	The door starts to shut.LINDAAaaaaaahhhh!

	She hits the top of a LIGHTER duct-taped to the hose. A 
	line of PRESSURIZED FIRE BLOWS into the elevator. 
	WWHHHOOOOSSHHHH! Sebastian goes up in flame. Linda runs 
	toward the elevator. Just as the door's about to close, 
	she slides. Her foot jamming into it. 
	She lets loose with the flame again. Sebastian, backed 
	into the corner, has no where to go. He's yelling in 
	pain. His latex FACE BUBBLES and burns. The surgical 
	scrubs SINGE BLACK. With no other escape route, he dives 
	toward the door. Linda looks up to see his flaming body 
	fly over her, back into the corridor. Linda kills the 
	tank as Sebastian continues to burn. The elevator lights 
	flickers and the security panel goes up in a shower of 
	sparks. The elevator dies. Linda pulls herself to her 
	feet and turns to see...

	Half of Sebastian's head MELTED AWAY, his latex facade a 
	gruesome smoke-damaged mass. His clothes are half burned 
	revealing large blistering bubbly welts underneath, like 
	deformed blackened bubble wrap.

	Sebastian crawls to his feet, but Linda hits him with 
	another shot of flame.

	Sebastian pulls at his clothes as he crawls around the 
	corner.SEBASTIANOh God!

	Linda stalks toward him.LINDAYou wanna see God? I'll show you God. 

	Linda turns the corner to see a heap of smoldering latex 
	and clothing strewn about the corridor floor. Sebastian, 
	looking like some ugly creature, pushes down the 
	corridor. He throbs with his blackened skin blistering 
	and cracking up and down his body. Linda lets loose 
	another jet of flame. It's smaller than the first and 
	doesn't quite hit Sebastian. Linda checks the tanks 
	pressure gauge. It slowly drops. Linda follows the 
	blackened horror into the maze of tunnels. But as he 
	pushes along the corridor, his burns slowly re- absorb 
	themselves. Sebastian is no longer visible. A quiet 
	moment in the hallway as Linda realizes how vulnerable 
	she is. She looks around for him desperately. Nothing. 
	But something on the ceiling catches her attention. She 
	blasts it with the last jet of her dying torch. THE 
	SPRINKLER SYSTEM, hit by fire, comes to life. Water 
	sprays down on the tunnel. Sebastian is caught in the 
	downpour, his invisible frame outlined by water. It comes 
	toward her, the hot skin steaming in the water. He grabs 
	Linda and slams her against the wall. His watery hand 
	smashes her across her face. Linda reels. On the floor, 
	she looks to see Sebastian stalking toward her. She 
	crawls away, but he grabs her by her hair, pulls her to 
	her feet and slams her against the wall.SEBASTIANI'm gonna find everyone in your family 
			and kill them-. Your sister... she 
			never liked me. I think I'll go after 
			her and her little boy first. 

	Sebastian smashes her head against a metal post. Her head 
	cuts open, blood dripping down.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			I just wanted you to know that before 
			you die.

	Linda collapses to the floor. Sebastian's foot presses 
	against her neck, squeezing it. Linda gags for breath. 
	But through the shoot of water that is Sebastian, we see 
	something also... a watery smudge.BAM!MATT - smashes Sebastian with the metal bar. Sebastian 
	slams against the corridor wall and sinks down.

	Matt staggers. It's taken all his strength to got there. 
	He drops the crowbar and seeks the wall for support, he 
	sinks to his knees by Linda.MATTThought I'd... thought I'd save you 
			for a change.

	He gives her his hand and pulls her up into his arms.

				MATT (cont'd)
			Let's got out of here.

	Just as the two turn, Sebastian rises with the crowbar. 
	He swings it with a yell. Matt pushes Linda out of the 
	way, his arm glancing the blow into a conduit. The 
	conduit splits open and severs ELECTRICAL wiring. The 
	VOLTAGE shoots up the crowbar and into Sebastian. As the 
	current pulses through his body, Sebastian vibrates. His 
	blood vessels yank back to visibility, followed by his 
	skeletal structure and major organs. Sebastian is slowly 
	electrified. Smoke pours off him and he becomes more and 
	more visible. Finally he collapses. His body throbbing in 
	and out of visibility. Matt and Linda stumble away.INT. CORRIDOR - DAYJust outside the lab... Linda tries to pry open the 
	sealed doors with the crowbar. But she can't.

	Through the doors porthole she sees a collection of 
	chemicals and the fire raging from the earlier explosion.LINDANitro...

	Matt peaks inside.MATTHe said it himself... All they'll find

	at the ceiling. The maintenance hatch comes down.LINDAGrab on.

	Linda hooks the crowbar onto the hatch lip and pulls 
	herself up. She reaches back down for Matt.MATTForget about me. You go.LINDAFuck you. Give me your hands.

	Linda grabs Matt's hands and pulls for all she's worth. 
	She struggles, but they both manage to got him through 
	the hatch.INT. LABORATORY - DAYThree... two... one. The centrifuge springs to life.

	The centrifuge spins the two dozen vials slowly at first.INT. VENTLinda and Matt are on top of the elevator.

	Linda's hands search the wall. Bar fingers run across the 
	smooth metal surface.

	From the little light below she can see a maintenance 
	ladder that spans the entire height of the vertical tube. 
	They look up and see it disappear into the darkness.LINDAClimb!MATTBut...LINDAClimb!

	Matt starts up, rung after rung. Linda climbs right 
	behind him.INT. LABORATORYThe centrifuge spins faster and faster. The vials are 
	starting to rattle.INT. ELEVATOR SHAFTLinda and Matt pull themselves up the ladder as quick as 
	they can.MATTI can't. I'm going to pass out.LINDAKeep moving.

	He does, through sheer force of will. Blood from his 
	wound drips down on Linda's face. No telling how much 
	further they have to go in this darkness. Light leaks in 
	from the maintenance hatch below.INT. LABORATORYThe centrifuge's whine has reached a fevered pitch. The 
	vials shake violently.

	Then... one of the vials shatters.

	A FLASH OF LIGHT. A HUGE EXPLOSION rips through the 
	laboratory.INT. TUNNELThe EXPLOSION rips through the lab doors. A MASSIVE 
	FIREBALL rolls down the tunnel swallowing everything in

	SURROUNDED BY FLAMES flying up toward them, lifted by the 
	explosion's SHOCK WAVES.LINDAOh God!MATTDon't look.

	The carriage accelerates toward them, faster and faster. 
	Its loose cables whip around the shaft, slapping the 
	walls around the pair. Its gonna hit them! Linda pulls 
	herself close to the ladder and closes her eyes. She's 
	pressed against Matt. The elevator... 50 feet... 40 ... 
	30 ... W0000000SH! It flames RIGHT BY THEM. 
	When Linda opens her eyes, the elevator is HUNDREDS OF 
	FEET ABOVE THEM and a wall of fire is below them, closing 
	in.LINDAMove!

	Panicked, Linda pushes Matt up the ladder as she stares 
	down at the rising fire wall. But the fire dissipates 
	before it hits them, though a stray tongue of flames 
	reaches up to lick the soles of her feet.

	They hear a terrifying moan and looks up to see the 
	elevator peaking far above her. It slows to a stop andBEGINS TO FALL.MATTIt's coming down!

	FASTER AND FASTER. Coming back toward them in complete 
	free- fall. It's emergency brakes clamp down, slowing it. 
	Metal against metal. Sparks flying. One of the brakes 
	shears. Then another. The elevator unseats from it's 
	tracks, SLAMMING against the walls as it TUMBLES. Linda 
	sees that the elevator is out of control, and watches as 
	it ping-pongs toward them... smashing into the access 
	ladder, smashing into the wall. The elevator slows, but 
	continues slamming side-to-side. Linda cringes as the 
	elevator crashes into the wall above them. But it jams 
	there, stopping. They pull their heads away from wall and 
	look up. The elevator just hangs there, suspended. 
	There's a small crawlspace between the elevator and the 
	ladder.LINDAC'mon. Before it slips.

	They begins to climb up again. Matt shimmies through the 
	tight hollow, and squeezes out the other side, followed 
	by Linda. She breathes a sigh of relief and just hangs 
	there a moment when ... Ah! Something grabs her. A singed 
	throbbing hand emerges from the darkness, gripping at her 
	leg.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			It's him.

	She kicks at it and sees a dark dirty face - a swirl of 
	dirt, grime and smoke with hollow eyes - rise up the 
	ladder.MATTSebastian, you fuck.LINDAGet off me.

	Sebastian pulls himself up Linda's body. Translucent 
	dirty hands paving at the fabric of her clothes. Linda 
	tries to climb with this thing on her. But Sebastian 
	grabs her around the neck. She begins choking for breath. 
	Linda fights to keep her grip on the ladder... She looks 
	down at the ten foot drop to the elevator and then... She 
	lets go!MATTNo!

	She and Sebastian plummet through the smoky haze and slam 
	against the top of the elevator. Linda seems to hover a 
	few above the elevator, Sebastian's shadowy outline below 
	her. Matt painfully lowers himself down the ladder. But 
	metal groans and the elevator drops another five feet. 
	Linda struggles to her feet. Sebastian rises. A menacing 
	dark figure stalking toward her. Linda pushes back from 
	him. Sebastian grabs her by the hair and pulls bar over 
	to the ladder. The elevator strains and groans.LINDALet go of me.

	Sebastian presses her up against the ladder. Presses into 
	her from behind. He has her trapped. His dirty hand 
	reaches out and strokes her hair.SEBASTIANRemember the day we met? You were 
			wearing a red dress and you were so 
			pretty. Now... Now look at you.MATTGet off of her!

	Sebastian pulls her hair back and kisses her neck with 
	his filthy, dirt-smeared mouth and half-burned away face.

				MATT (cont'd)
			Sebastian, stop it.

	Linda and Sebastian struggle. Matt reaches down to try 
	and grab her, help her.SEBASTIANYou fucked it all up.

	Linda looks at her feet. The last elevator emergency 
	brake grips its cable. She grits her tooth and grabs hold 
	of the ladder.LINDAGo to hell. 

	Linda stamps on the brake release. The ELEVATOR TUMBLES 
	... along with Sebastian. It slams into the fiery abyss a 
	hundred yards below. Linda hangs, one hand holding onto

	back onto the ladder, using all his remaining strength.EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAYLinda and Matt stumble out into the blazing sunshine.
