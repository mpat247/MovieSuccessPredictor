	dots appear on the hillside vegetation.  WHOOSH.CLOSERWe realize the dots are people.  Workers swinging long steel

	to remain calm.DIEGOYou will watch what you say.  Especially

	Cesar is uncomfortable.  Diego stands.DIEGO (CONT'D)Okay.  That's enough.INEZGet your hands off me.

	They walk into the crowded courtroom.INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - JACKSONVILLE - 1990 - DAYPacked.  Nuts.  Standing room only.  The courtroom buzzes as
	George is led down the center aisle and is handed off to the
	bailiff.  Over this we hear...CLERKSir, please state your name.GEORGEI'm George Jung.  Spelled J-U-N-G.CLERKThank you.PROSECUTORMr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?GEORGEYes, I do.PROSECUTORDo you see him here in the courtroom?GEORGEYes, he's sitting right there at the end
		of the table.PROSECUTORLet the record state the witness has
		identified, Diego Delgado.

	The following sound bytes are dissolved together in montage
	style...PROSECUTOR (CONT'D)Mr. Jung, can you describe the
		circumstances of how you began talking
		about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?GEORGEShortly after I arrived at Danbury
		Federal Correctional Institute I related
		to Diego that the crime I was in for was
		smuggling marijuana.
		Diego told me he had high level
		connections in Colombia and they needed
		to find someone to help them transport
		cocaine into America...GEORGE (CONT'D)The first run was fifteen kilos, which
		we smuggled into Logan Airport in hard
		shelled suitcases.GEORGE (CONT'D)We wrapped the cocaine in kitchen
		cabinet paper, and duct tape, that way
		if there were any dogs in customs...GEORGE (CONT'D)I introduced Diego to a pilot named Jack
		Stevens, who helped us fly 300 kilos of
		cocaine per week into the United States
		via twin-engine Cessnas.  Jack would fly
		into North Carolina, we'd meet him there
		and drive it down to different
		distribution points...GEORGE (CONT'D)I never met Pablo Escobar.  Diego
		Delgado was my only connection to
		cocaine from Colombia...GEORGE (CONT'D)Diego convinced me to keep most of my
		money in a Panamanian bank.  Diego had a
		close relationship with Manuel Noriega.
		In exchange for allowing us to keep our
		money there, we paid him a percentage.GEORGE (CONT'D)There was an 85% chance that if you
		snorted cocaine between 1977-1984, it
		was ours. Initially with my LA
		connections, we invented the
		marketplace.  In 1977, there was no
		other real competition.GEORGE (CONT'D)The first year we made about 100 million
		dollars between us.  It was an expensive
		operation.  Eventually we built up to
		three different pilots doing multiple
		runs per week, connections on both
		coasts, everything was running smooth.
		We were like a corporation...GEORGE (CONT'D)he was very anti-government.  He talked
		about revolution, forming his own
		country or island, he was looking for
		power as well as money.  I was just
		looking for money.GEORGE (CONT'D)He disliked the United States, thought
		it was a police state.  He hoped that by
		flooding the country with cocaine, it
		would disrupt the political system and
		tear down the morality of the country.GEORGE (CONT'D)Well, yes, Derek Foreal was my
		connection, I met him back in 1968 when
		I first moved to Manhattan Beach.  It
		was Foreal's marijuana connections that
		kicked off our cocaine market.GEORGE (CONT'D)Yes, it was my idea to bring the kilos
		to Los Angeles.  When Diego finally got
		Derek Foreal's name from me, it was only
		a matter of months before he'd cut me
		out.GEORGE (CONT'D)I'm not sure how my relationship with my
		daughter and ex-wife have anything to do
		with this trial.  I mean we're here to
		talk about Diego Delgado, aren't we?CALIBANOSYes, we are Mr. Jung.

	We come out of the montage, the defense attorney Diego
	Delgado, Joe Calibanos, a sleazy-Greek-like-ex-basketball
	weight lifter guy is now doing the questioning.CALIBANOS (CONT'D)Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon,
		correct?GEORGEYes, I am.CALIBANOSDo you have any agreement or
		understanding whatsoever with the United
		States government in regards to your
		testimony?GEORGENo, I cam here out of my own volition.CALIBANOSExcuse me?GEORGESomething about vengance being best
		served cold.CALIBANOSReally.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?GEORGEExcuse me?CALIBANOSMr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or
		understanding with the United States
		Government in connection with your
		testimony in this case?GEORGEI'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no
		chance of parole.  Even if they cut my
		sentence in half I'll be seventy-three
		years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I
		don't know if the parole board, the
		judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself
		can get me out of here.  I have a really
		bad record, I'm not sure what's going to
		happen.CALIBANOSSo you do have an agreement with the
		United States Government, Mr. Jung,
		correct?

	George can't respond.  Looks to Diego.  Looks from the jury,
	the judge, George is on the spotlight and it's uncomfortable.
	He feels suddenly sleazy.CALIBANOS (CONT'D)I thought so.  No more questions.

	Silence.  The judge tells George he can step down.  Calibanos
	laughs quietly with associates.  George is bummed.  He walks
	by Diego.  They look at each other.GEORGEYou shouldn't have taken the 30 million,
		Diego, I was out.
