           (Sweet guitar solo - 16 measures]
           Relaxed as hell when you're goin through time
          That's the 54 jets workin' on your spine
           (Yeah) you gotta be loose and you gotta be lean
          When you roll up in your Hot Tub Time Machine
          Yeah your shirt's a little psychedelic...
          And you're lookin kinda like Tom Selleck...
          Yeah the chicks are wetter than the Everglades
          But double bag your dude, don't wanna get AIDS
          Just listen right up, consider me your dean
          In the college of the Hot Tub Time Machine
          Yeah!
          Hot Tub - Time Machine!

          Yeah!FADE IN:EXT. POOL DECK - DAYBLUE SKIES. A BEAUTIFUL SUNNY DAY.CAMERA PANS DOWN to reveal A HOT TUB FULL OF HOT CHICKS IN
          BIKINIS. They splash about playfully. Then--A FUCKING LION JUMPS IN THE HOT TUB!As the girls SCREAM and scramble for safety, the BEAST ROARS
          and it becomes the:MGM LOGODISSOLVE TO:INT. BEDROOM - DAYADAM COLEMAN (late 30s, good-looking, sweet-natured face) is
          in a great mood as he packs a SUITCASE.LILY (O.S.)Ready for the wildest bachelor
          party of all time?
          LILY (early 30s, shirt and jeans, hot in a smart and classy
          sense) walks in the room, smiling.ADAMYou know it. I'm gonna bang all
          sorts of chicks this weekend!LILYThat's not the answer I was looking
          for.ADAMSorry, honey.
          Adam gives his beautiful fiancee a playful kiss.
          She shows him some PHOTOS.LILYLook what I found...2.ANGLE: PHOTOA BUNCH OF TEENAGERS and 20-SOMETHINGS PARTY IN A LARGE HOT
          TUB at a SKI RESORT. It looks like the most fun ever.ADAMCheck out that young stud. Can you
          believe he's about to get married?
          Lily and Adam look through more PHOTOS of a YOUNG ADAM (17)
          partying at a SKI RESORT with his FRIENDS:
          -- In full 80s SKI GEAR on a mountain...
          -- Eating PIZZA at "Papa Enzo's," stuffing their faces...
          -- Drinking BEERS at the "Brew Haus," an awesome pub...
          -- In the HOT TUB with SIX GIRLS...
          Adam snatches the last photo from her.ADAM (CONT'D)Ignore that one. Nothing happened.(BEAT)I love you.
          Lily laughs.LILYAdam, you didn't know me yet.
          As Adam goes back to packing, Lily leafs through some more of
          the photos. She stops at one and her EXPRESSION CHANGES.LILY (CONT'D)Who's this?
          Lily shows Adam a PHOTO:
          -- A SMOKING HOT SKI BUNNY (23, blonde, svelte, leg warmers).ADAMI'm not sure.LILYReally?
          Lily shows Adam another PHOTO:
          -- YOUNG ADAM with his arm around the SKI BUNNY, who looks
          like she was ambushed for the photo.3.ADAMOh! Jennie.LILYWho's Jennie?ADAMShe's nobody. Ski instructor.
          (off her look)
          You didn't know me yet.
          Lily still looks at him a little hard.ADAM (CONT'D)Lily, I was 17. She had boobs and
          a face. Of course I'm gonna take
          her picture.
          Lily still looks a little bothered.LILYDo you still think of her?ADAMOf course not! I think of you.
          As Adam goes to EMBRACE her:LILYHold on...
          Lily goes into the CLOSET.ADAMSweetie?
          She comes out a moment later with a CARDBOARD BOX, which she
          empties onto the BED. About FIFTY PORNO MAGAZINES spill out,
          ranging from TITS MONTHLY to BLACK ASS.ADAM (CONT'D)How did you know where I hid my...
          treasure?
          Lily carefully picks up a BROCHURE from the pile, holding it
          by the corner, not wanting to touch it.LILYExplain this.
          From ADAM'S POV, we see the brochure:
          -- A ski brochure featuring Jennie on the cover.4.ADAMOK! You caught me! I
          occasionally... reminisce... about
          Jennie O'Keefe!LILYThat's gross.(THEN)What's "occasionally?"ADAM(without missing a beat)
          About two hours ago when you were
          on the phone with your mother.LILYJesus. Tell me how I'm supposed to
          let you go to your bachelor party
          and not be a basket case?ADAMWhat are you so worried about?LILYI'm worried that you're still
          thinking about this girl.ADAMBaby, the girl in that picture was
          nothing more than a crush. I could
          never get her and there's no
          possibility I'll ever be with her.
          She was a total stranger.
          Lily gets a CURIOUS LOOK on her face.LILYSo... you're into strangers?ADAMWell not the creepy "your mom was
          in an accident, now come with me"
          kind. But yeah, the hot lady in
          the supermarket kind of stranger.
          You have to admit - it's kinda hot.LILYSo you're saying if you and I
          didn't know each other, it would be
          pretty hot if we fooled around?ADAMYou kidding me? It would be
          fucking incredible.5.Lily smiles seductively, as Adam starts to get it.ADAM (CONT'D)Wait a minute. Are you
          suggesting... yes. YES!
          Adam excitedly heads for the door.ADAM (CONT'D)OK, I'll go down the hall. You get
          into character.
          (points at her)
          This fucking rules.
          Adam leaves the room and Lily REMOVES HER SHIRT, talking sexy
          and slowly building the fantasy...LILYOh I'm all alone in this big house.
          Cheerleading camp just ended and I
          need to get out of these sweaty
          clothes...ADAM (O.S.)Love where you're going with this,
          baby! Keep it up!
          She unbuttons her pants and SLIDES DOWN HER JEANS.LILYMmmm. My panties are so tight
          against my firm naked body...ADAM (O.S.)You should probably take them off!LILYAre you gonna let me do this?ADAM (O.S.)Sorry! Continue! You were just
          about to take off your panties!
          She slowly slides out of her panties, kicking them away. Now
          she's TOTALLY NAKED. She continues to role play.LILYIt feels so good to be so naked. I
          hope no one can see me...
          Just then a BLACK MAN (late 30s, handsome, J Crew) saunters
          through the bedroom door, holding a coffee and all riled up.6.BLACK MANOK, so this asshole in front of me
          at the donut place is -- WHOA!
          Lily covers up and SCREAMS.LILYGet out of here!!
          He SPILLS the coffee on his hands and their rug as he turns.BLACK MANFuck! Ow! I'm sorry. I'll clean
          it up. That's gonna stain, though.LILYJust leave!
          He heads for the door, just as:
          Adam comes in, wearing a MAILMAN hat and NOTHING ELSE.ADAMSpecial delivery for -- Jesus
          Christ!
          The black man doesn't know which way to look. He covers his
          eyes and drips coffee, as he blindly steps toward the door.BLACK MAN(NOT LOOKING)Just tell me when I'm in the clear.CUT TO:EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - DAYAdam wheels his suitcase down the front path of this modest,
          well-kept suburban home, as a recovered, dressed, embarrassed
          and somewhat shell-shocked Lily follows with a small bag.
          They both stop 10 yards short of a RANGE ROVER, where the
          black man, NICK, waits in the car, waving.LILYI can't wait for you to come back
          and marry me. Wow, that's crazy.
          Adam looks almost like it just hit him.7.ADAMYeah.(REALIZATION)Wow.LILYTell me again I have nothing to
          worry about.ADAMBabe, look at Nick...
          In the car, Nick air drums to whatever's on the radio.ADAM (CONT'D)You think with him in charge, we're
          gonna get into any kind of trouble?
          We'll probably eat too much pizza
          and I'll twist my ankle getting off
          the ski lift.LILYOK. Have an awesome bachelor
          party. Not too awesome.
          (hands him bag)
          I got you something.
          Adam looks in the bag.ADAMSandwich. Thanks.
          He puts it in his BACKPACK. She looks like she was expecting
          a different reaction, but she lets it go. He kisses her.LILYLet me see your phone.
          He takes it out.ADAMI told you, I'll call you when--
          She snatches it out of his hands. Adam looks confused, as
          she pockets the phone.LILYDespite my anxiety, I'm not gonna
          be one of those women who wants an
          update every ten minutes. Even
          though I do want an update every
          ten minutes.
          Adam smiles. Lily looks a bit trepidatious.8.LILY (CONT'D)Just make sure whatever happens,
          you're back for the rehearsal
          dinner.(SHOWING CONCERN)I totally trust you.ADAMYou should. I'm a lame-o.LILYWell at least you're a cute lame-o.
          Lily leans in and they NUZZLE their noses together in a
          disgusting display of affection. A FLASH goes off.
          From the car, Nick holds up his iPhone.NICKI'm more than willing to forget
          about earlier, but this shit's
          going on Facebook.INT. NICK'S CAR - DAY - DRIVINGNick drives through SUBURBIA, while Adam rides shotgun.NICKI have no idea what Facebook is.
          My phone has a button that says
          Send To Facebook. I've been
          sending shit there for months.
          Adam looks out the window, smiling.ADAMI'm so psyched about this weekend!NICKDitto, buddy. I'm gonna help you
          make up for all the good times you
          missed when you were being a
          responsible member of society.ADAMYou're a good friend. I'm sorry
          for putting my career and self
          sufficiency above bowling night.NICKThis trip represents everything
          awesome about being a dude.(MORE)9.NICK (CONT'D)We're gonna drink too much, eat
          whatever we want...(FANTASIZING)I might not even change my socks.ADAMLive the dream.NICKBest of all, we don't have to
          answer to anyone.
          Nick's PHONE rings and he answers it with his built-in
          BLUETOOTH. His phone voice is a little more "sensitive."NICK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)Hi honey.COURTNEY (V.0.)Three goddamn bags of pretzels?NICK (ON PHONE)(trying to save face)
          I'm with Adam, honey.COURTNEY (V.0.)Hi Adam.
          (a little calmer)
          Nick, what have I told you about
          buying snacks that aren't on sale?NICK (ON PHONE)You said not to do it.COURTNEY (V.0.)And what did you do?NICK (ON PHONE)I bought three bags of pretzels.
          But I'm gonna eat them...COURTNEY (V.0.)That's not the point.(ADMONISHING)Don't do it again.
          Nick and Adam exchange an embarrassing glance.NICK (ON PHONE)OK.COURTNEY (V.0.)Call me from the road. Adam, say
          hi to Lily.10.ADAM (ON PHONE)OK, I sure wi--
          CLICK. For a moment, there is an uncomfortable silence.ADAM (CONT'D)Don't her parents own the
          supermarket?NICKThe whole damn chain.(THEN)Just be thankful Lily doesn't have
          any family money. Nothing makes
          your dick softer.EXT. MOTEL -- DAYNick's car pulls into the lot of a rundown motel.INT./EXT. NICK'S CAR - DAYAdam looks confused and slightly nervous.ADAMThis looks like a place where
          people die. Mostly from murder.
          A BALD, miserable-looking GUY in his late 30s (LOU) exits a
          room, carrying TWO SHOPPING BAGS. He gets in the back seat.
          Adam looks happy to see him.ADAM (CONT'D)Lou!LOUYes, I'm living in a transient
          motel. Let's get that purple
          elephant out of the room.ADAMDude, it looks nice.LOUThank you. I hate your guts.ADAM(re: the bags)
          What'd you bring?11.LOUAll my belongings.NICKSo you're sorta like a bum now,
          huh?LOUIn a sense.INT. NICK'S CAR - DAY - DRIVINGLou sits in the backseat, voraciously eating a bowl of
          cereal, as the other guys are up front.LOUOur system is fucked, gentlemen.
          You tell me how a whore wife can
          fuck some black dude - no offense -
          and still take her cuckold of a
          husband for all he's got.NICKWhy would I take offense to that?LOUIt's offensive.NICKBecause he's black?LOUAnd because he's fucking my wife.
          And because you're black. And
          because of all the oversensitive
          horrible garbage... you know what?
          Forget no offense. Just offense.
          Are you offended?NICKNot really.LOUThen shut the fuck up.ADAMShe's got a hell of an attorney.LOUYes and thank you so very much for
          giving her the referral.12.ADAMShe told me it was for a friend.NICKSo... what? Your wife likes black
          dick now?LOUI'm gonna slaughter you in your
          sleep tonight.ADAM(turns to Lou, genuine)
          Thanks for coming, man.EXT. UPSCALE APARTMENT BUILDING - DAYNick's car pulls up across from a nice apartment building, as
          a well-dressed, well-groomed, overly polished-looking YOUNG
          GUY in his 20s (JACOB) comes out, carrying a MESSENGER BAG.INT. NICK'S CAR -- SAME TIMEThe guys watch Jacob carefully cross the street.LOUOh, Adam's stupid brother's coming?
          Boo! Drive away before he gets in
          the car!ADAMBe nice. I know Jacob's kind of a
          douche, but I'm trying to be closer
          to him since Mom died.
          Jacob gets in the back next to Lou.LOU(VERY INSINCERE)Hey buddy! How's it going? Good
          to see you!JACOBYou look dirty and you smell bad.LOUYou look gay and you smell like a
          basket of fancy soaps. Advantage
          me.JACOBHow is that to your advantage?13.ADAMHe's not gay. He's just... what
          are you again?JACOBMetrosexual.LOUYou have sex with trains?JACOBFor your information, I fuck
          chicks. Hot ones.LOUFor your information, you fuck
          dudes. Gay ones.JACOBYeah, well at least I'm young and
          my life's full of potential. I
          hear you're homeless now?LOU(to Nick and Adam)
          You told him?!(GRIMACES)I hate all you people.ADAMWill you two please shake hands and
          make up? We're gonna be spending a
          lot of time together.
          Jacob distractedly TEXTS on his phone.JACOBYeah, about that. Why aren't we
          going to Aspen? Vermont's lame.ADAMIt's gonna be fun.JACOBYeah, whatever.
          And with that, the guys travel in silence for a few moments,
          the lifeblood drained from the car. Finally...LOUI've gotta take a shit.14.INT. BURGER KING REST STOP - DAYLou walks from the bathroom back to the TABLE where Adam,
          Nick, and Jacob sit and eat.LOUThat was an ugly experience.NICKI don't wanna hear about it.LOUIn a few years, when I'm dying of
          an exotic disease that causes my
          penis to bleed until it falls off,
          someone remember to tell the
          hospital to check out the filthy
          crapper at the Albany Rest Stop.
          It's the AIDS monkey of toilets.
          The guys put down their sandwiches.ADAMThank you.LOUI don't know how you're doing it,
          man. I mean, Laurie's hot, don't
          get me wrong.ADAM(CORRECTING)Lily.LOURight. Lily. But one vagina?
          Forever?ADAMThat's the sacrifice.
          Jacob nods, agreeing with Lou's concern.JACOBAnd you're OK with that? I don't
          know your sexual history, but you
          sure you got it out of your system?ADAMI did OK for myself.LOUHe didn't do that well for himself.15.NICKYeah, isn't Lily your fourth?ADAMFifth. Thank you.JACOBSo you're averaging like one girl
          every eight years.ADAMAssuming I got laid when I was
          zero.LOUThat would be awesome.
          Adam gives Lou a distasteful look.ADAMI'm fine. Maybe some cold feet,
          but that's normal. Thank you
          everyone for your concern.JACOBJust looking out for you. That's
          what brothers do, right? They look
          out for each other?ADAM(takes a moment)
          Is this about something else?JACOBForget it.ADAMNo, let's do this. I'm sorry I
          wasn't around when you were growing
          up, OK? I was in college. And
          then I was working. Dad left.
          Someone had to take responsibility.LOUBoooooring!ADAM(TO LOU)Shut up.JACOBI said forget it.16.NICKGuys, come on. Let's move past it.
          This is gonna be a fun weekend.JACOBI still say Vermont sucks.LOUYou're confusing Vermont with
          yourself. This weekend is going to
          be incredible and you will not ruin
          it for me.ADAM(softens, to Jacob)
          You might like it. Havenhurst is
          pretty awesome.
          Jacob shrugs, but Lou gets excited.LOUFuck yeah it is! We're gonna ski
          the trail and bone some tail!ADAM(LAUGHS)You'll have to bone some of that
          tail for me, man.LOUFuck that. You'll bone your own.ADAMNo I won't.LOUAdam, trust me. Biggest mistake of
          my life - not fucking a whore at my
          bachelor party.NICKThat's the biggest mistake of your
          life?LOUFuck yeah. And he's not making
          that same mistake.ADAMUh... I'm not having sex with
          anyone this weekend.
          Lou looks at Adam, trying to figure things out.17.LOUOhhhh. I gotcha.(WINKING)You're not having sex this weekend.ADAMI'm not having sex this weekend.
          Without the winking.LOU(WINKING)Right. No winking.(WINKS AGAIN)I understand.ADAMI'm pretty sure you don't.INT./EXT. NICK'S CAR - DAY - DRIVINGNick's car transitions from the HIGHWAY to the MOUNTAINS to
          the WOODS, as we track the drive.
          Finally, the car passes a "Welcome to Havenhurst" sign.NICKGentlemen... welcome to Havenhurst.ADAMYes!EXT. HAVENHURST MAIN DRAG - AFTERNOONThe car winds through the main thoroughfare. Rather than a
          quaint ski town, this place resembles a suburban nightmare,
          with STRIP MALLS and CHAIN RESTAURANTS. It's the exact
          opposite of the fun town we saw in Adam's photos.INT./EXT. NICK'S CAR - AFTERNOON - DRIVINGThe guys look out the windows, wearing bummed expressions.JACOBso this is the coolest town ever?ADAMOh man. The Brew Haus is a PF
          Chang's.
          Lou notices a TGI Friday's, with a sign advertising a "Hannah
          Montana 3-D Experience!" He looks utterly disgusted.18.LOUI don't even have the heart to tell
          you what I just fucking saw. But
          say goodbye to Papa Enzo's. This
          town sucks.NICKWhat the fuck is going on?
          The car climbs a twisty part of the road.NICK (CONT'D)Please god let it still be there...JACOBWhat?ADAMPink Paradise. Best strip club
          ever.
          The car rounds the corner and a SIGN comes into view. The
          beginning reads "Pink."NICKYes! It lives!
          The car continues to climb and the whole sign comes into
          view: "Pinkberry."LOUI wanna die.JACOB(OBLIVIOUS)Sweet, there's a Pinkberry here.EXT. PINE VALLEY INN - AFTERNOONThe car pulls into the parking lot of this RUNDOWN lodge.INT. PINE VALLEY INN / LOBBY - AFTERNOONThe guys walk in and the first thing they notice is a bunch
          of CATS that wander anywhere they want.
          The large "living room" area off the lobby features a FIRE
          PLACE that has been BRICKED SHUT.
          TODDLERS and ELDERLY PEOPLE lounge and cry and nap.19.LOU(TO NICK)What have you done to us?ADAMI'm not playing drinking games with
          my grandma.NICKOK so the place skews a little

          spending our time inside anyway.INT. PINE VALLEY INN / HALLWAY - MINUTES LATERThe guys walk silently behind a MIDDLE-AGED BELLHOP (PHIL),
          who struggles to wrangle their bags on a shaky hand truck.
          His job is made more difficult because he only has ONE ARM.
          He grunts and curses his way down the hall on the slow and
          laborious journey. But when Adam tries to pick up a bag...PHIL(CURT)Hey buddy. I'm not gonna tell you
          again. I fuckin' got it.
          Adam backs off.LOUThis guy's a dick.NICKSHH--LOUNo, fuck that.(LOUDER)He's a dick. Oooh tough guy. He's
          gotta be Mister America.JACOBCaptain America.LOUGo fuck yourself.
          Phil finally drops their bags at their room and then:PHILI'm ready to be tipped.20.LOU(SELF UNAWARE)You, sir, have no tact.
          Nick gives Phil a bill and he walks off down the hall,
          leaving the guys outside their room.NICKGentlemen... in this room lies the
          beginning of our awesome weekend.JACOBOr a continuation of everything
          that's sucked so far.LOUYeah, I bet it's gonna be lame as
          shit in there. The furniture
          probably smells like mold.JACOBI say we go to Foxwoods.LOUI actually kinda like that idea.ADAMGuys!
          Everyone looks at Adam.ADAM (CONT'D)Let's give it a chance. We don't
          know for sure that the room sucks.
          Nick nods, appreciating the optimism. He opens the door:INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - AFTERNOONThe room SUCKS. The ancient furniture looks like it smells
          like mold and there is nothing redeemable about the place.ADAM(SHRUGS)OK, so now we know.
          The guys drag their bags in and depressingly take stock of
          the situation -- presently the dirty old room.JACOBWhat the hell is with this place?21.LOUIt's like a Stephen King novel,
          except not as cool.NICKWe'll feel a lot better once we hit
          the slopes.(SMILES)Plus, I know there's one thing to
          look forward to.EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - AFTERNOONOn a patio outside their suite, our guys stare at a KICK-ASS
          TOP OF THE LINE HOT TUB. Spacious seating, plenty of jets,
          underwater lighting. It's amazing.
          Adam, Nick, and Lou look energized.LOUThank. God.ADAMAt least some things never change.JACOBWhat's the big deal about a hot
          tub?ADAMShame on you.NICKThere's plenty of time for tubbin'.
          Let's ski.EXT. MOUNTAIN - AFTERNOONAt the top of the mountain, Adam, Nick, and Lou look
          ridiculous in TIGHT, RETRO-STYLE NEON SKI JUMPSUITS. Jacob,
          on a snowboard, is the only one dressed in current attire.JACOB(re: their outfits)
          When's the last time you guys
          actually went skiing?ADAMIt's been a few years.NICKI think we look good.22.JACOBThen you're an idiot.NICKAll right, we race down the
          mountain. Loser buys first round.
          Premium shit only.JACOBYou gonna be all right?NICKWhat does that mean?JACOBI dunno - do black dudes ski?NICKOf course black dudes ski. Aren't
          I wearing skis?JACOBI'm just not sure you're
          representative.NICKYou're calling me an Uncle Tom?JACOBI don't even know what that means.NICKIt means black dudes ski.
          (pulls down goggles)
          Catch ya at the bottom.
          Nick takes off and... gets about 15 FEET, before he hits a
          GRASSY PATCH and falls over.LOUBlack dudes don't ski.ADAM(MOCK YELLING)How's the bottom?CUT TO:ADAM HITS A BAD PATCH AND FALLS DOWN.CUT TO:23.JACOB AND LOU COLLIDE, BOTH TRYING TO AVOID A BARE PATCH.CUT TO:NICK PICKS UP SPEED, BEFORE HITTING A BARE PATCH AND FALLING.A LITTLE OLD LADY SLOWLY SKIS PAST HIM, KICKING UP POWDER.EXT. HAVENHURST MAIN DRAG - NIGHTNick wears his "going out clothes" and walks along the main
          drag talking into his PHONE. It is clear that he is being
          CONSTANTLY INTERRUPTED on the other end of the conversation.NICK (ON PHONE)No, the black ones... without the
          pleats... Because the pleats make
          me look fat... No, I put it on the
          Amex... Because I'm the best man...
          I know, but I'm organizing... I'm

          I'm gonna collect cash from the
          guys... Yes... Yes... Yes.(LONG PAUSE)I love you too.
          Nick hangs up and we see that Adam, Lou, and Jacob have been
          walking with him, listening to his end of the conversation.ADAM(SYMPATHETIC)Dude...NICK(CLAPS HANDS)OK, who's ready to sink their teeth
          into a delicious dinner?INT. P.F. CHANG'S - NIGHTOur four guys looks MISERABLE, as they sit around a table at
           this popular Chinese food chain restaurant. Their
          overzealous WAITER (AIDEN) makes a big production of MIXING
          SAUCES, like he's Emeril.AIDENYou fellas look like you can handle
          some spice. I'm gonna knock it up
          a bit... throw some chili sauce in
          there... oh yeah, there it is.
          This is gonna knock your socks off.24.Nick's expression looks like he wants to kill the guy.NICKThank you.
          The waiter walks away and Nick RAISES HIS GLASS in a toast.NICK (CONT'D)I'd like to propose a toast. To my
          best friend, Adam. He may be
          throwing his life away, but at
          least he's throwing it away with a
          hot chick at his side.
          The guys LAUGH and clink glasses.NICK (CONT'D)And so what if you only have one
          vagina for the rest of your life.
          Speaking as someone who's seen your
          wife's vagina -- it's definitely
          one of the good ones.
          Lou and Jacob look confused, but clink glasses anyway, as
          Adam mouths "What the fuck" to Nick.
          Jacob raises his glass.JACOBTo my brother, I say thank you for
          including me. I promise to try to
          make the most of it.
          The guys look confused at the backhanded graciousness.ADAMThanks for coming, man. It means a
          lot to me.
          Jacob nods halfheartedly.NICKTo Adam!GUYSTo Adam!
          The guys hug and clink glasses and excitedly CHATTER. Just
          then, a MANAGER appears at the table and CLEARS HIS THROAT.MANAGERGentlemen. You're going to have to
          keep it down.25NICKCome on, man. It's our friend's
          bachelor party. We're just trying
          to roast him a little bit.MANAGERWell if you like roasts, I suggest
          the roast peking duck. It's out of
          this world and as I'm sure Aiden
          has told you, he can make it quite
          spicy.
          The guys look bothered.MANAGER (CONT'D)But as for the noisy kind of roast,
          that's going to have to stop. We
          have many other guests trying to
          enjoy the P.F. Chang's experience.
          The manager walks away. For a moment, the guys are quiet.
          Lou takes a bite of his food, chewing slowly.LOUThis kung pau chicken pairs very
          nicely with the 97 cab. Very
          impressive choice, Nick.NICKThank you.LOUAlso, this is the worst bachelor
          party I've ever been to.
          Everyone puts down their forks, cathartically fed up.JACOBTotally agree.ADAMNick, look. You had great
          intentions. No one's blaming you.LOUI'm blaming him.JACOBI'm totally blaming him. I didn't
          even want to go skiing.26.NICKOK I'll admit this trip is not off
          to the best start. But we're due
          for a victory!
          Nick thinks and actually gets an idea. He SNAPS his fingers.NICK (CONT'D)Hot tub!
          A lightbulb goes off for Adam too.ADAMYes!
          Lou gets up and throws down his napkin.LOUWhy did we even bother with dinner?
          Adam and Nick get up too.JACOBGuys, I'm still hungry.LOUQuiet, men are talking.
          Aiden approaches.AIDENGet you guys some to-go boxes?LOUI would like you to die. And then
          I would like you to leave.
          Aiden walks away, freaked out. Lou turns back to the guys.LOU (CONT'D)It's tub time.EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - NIGHTLou, Adam, and Nick all have HUGE SMILES, as they gaze at the
          tub. They each hold a TON OF BOOZE.
          Jacob looks indifferent and a little turned off by it all.
          Lou strips down to his underwear and CLIMBS IN.LOUOh my god. The water is perfect.27.He POURS A VODKA and SLAMS IT BACK.
          Adam climbs in with Lou, pouring his own drink.JACOBI really don't see the appeal.
          It's like a glorified bath.NICKJacob. Son. The hot tub is the
          whole thing! You ski all day.
          Then you hit the town, get trashed,
          and lure some fine ladies back to
          the lodge for some good old
          fashioned tubbin'.
          Nick CRACKS A BEER and pats Jacob on the back.NICK (CONT'D)So the town's dead? Fine, we skip
          that part and go right to the tub.
          Trust me. If there's fun to be
          had, the tub is a good start.
          Nick gets in.NICK (CONT'D)Yes! It's amazing.
          Now it's just Jacob outside the hot tub. The other three
          guys are already starting to look more energized and happy,
          splashing around. After another beat of consideration...JACOBFuck it.
          Jacob strips down and gets in. As he submerges, he actually
          starts to loosen up a bit and smiles.LOUWell?JACOBI'm not convinced this is anything
          more than a bath, but it's nice.NICKHit him with some bubbles.ADAMComing right up.
          Adam CRANKS A KNOB. As the BUBBLES comes to life, we begin a
          TUBBIN' MONTAGE over Reel 2 Real's "I Like to Move It."28.-- In the tub, the guys DRINK like fish, pouring various
          combinations of VODKA, RED BULL, MOUNTAIN DEW, BACARDI, and
          anything else they can get their hands on.
          -- Jacob's LAPTOP is propped on the edge of the tub, playing
          BETTER OFF DEAD. Every so often, one of our guys takes a
          drink, playing a game, the rules of which only they know.
          -- Adam takes a big bite of the SANDWICH Lily gave him.
          -- Nick uses his iPhone to take video and pictures.
          More drinking games. The guys wear funny HATS and roll
          dice on a PIECE OF WOOD. Adam has to drink some tub water.
          -- The guys keep reaching into ADAM'S BACKPACK for MIXERS.
          -- Nick, Adam, and Lou LAUGH. Then, Lou lifts up Jacob's
          head, which he has been FORCIBLY HOLDING UNDER WATER. Jacob
          coughs and spits out water and looks pissed. Then he smiles
          and helps submerge Nick's head in the same way.
          -- Slam! Another bottle of vodka killed. Crush! Another
          empty Red Bull his the patio.
          -- A BEAR eats some DORITOS that have been left on a PICNIC
          TABLE. Yards away in the tub, the guys laugh and taunt it.
          -- Lou BLEEDS from where the bear has obviously SCRATCHED HIM
          across the chest. Still, he dances in the tub.
          -- Just for an instant (did we see that?), the guys are 3
          BLACK GUYS and ONE WHITE GUY, before changing back.
          -- The guys wear their SNOWSUITS in the tub. Adam very
          dangerously jumps in, attached to a SNOWBOARD.
          -- The CUTS get QUICKER and QUICKER, as hands reach into the
          backpack. More vodka. More Dew. More Red Bull. More
          Bacardi... The cuts SPEED UP and INTENSIFY until finally in a
          BRILLIANT FLASH OF LIGHT, weEXPLODE TO:THE SUN RISING JUST ABOVE THE MOUNTAIN PEAKS.EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - DAWNAs the light of a new day spills into Havenhurst, we find all
          four of our guys PASSED OUT in the hot tub, the water calm.
          A KITTEN licks Lou's face. It's adorable. Until...29.Lou JOLTS AWAKE and PUKES ON THE KITTEN, sending it FLYING!
          This wakes up everyone and they stir to life, inspecting the
          carnage, mostly hangover-related.NICKOh my god, I wanna die.JACOBI need a vitamin water.
          Adam reaches in his backpack, taking out two choices.ADAMRed Bull or Fresca?
          Jacob takes the Fresca, as Lou inspects the CLAW MARKS.LOUThat fucking bear got me good.ADAMYeah he did.LOUBut we showed him, didn't we?ADAMIf by showing him, you mean we
          laughed and he got bored and
          wandered off into the woods with
          your sneakers, then yeah, we got
          him good.LOUFuck yeah.
          Lou picks up Adam's half-eaten sandwich and takes a BITE.ADAMYou just puked.LOUThat's why I'm eating your
          sandwich. I'm fucking starving.NICKGuys, look...
          Their gaze turns to the MOUNTAIN PEAK, on which is a fresh
          LAYER OF POWDER. It looks like perfect skiing conditions.ADAMLet's do it!30.EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATERAs the guys walk across the front of the lodge, they pass
          some well preserved CARS all parked together: a 1985 Pontiac
          Fiero, a 1986 VW Golf, and a 1987 Ford Mustang coupe.JACOBWhat is this, a shitty car club?
          The guys COMPLETELY MISS the BILLBOARDS ACROSS THE STREET:
          -- "Coming soon: the most spaced-out Mel Brooks film yet!SPACEBALLS!"-- A surfing MAX HEADROOM with a CAN OF COKE and the tag:
          "Catch the Wave!"
          -- A bull terrier named SPUDS MCKENZIE parking with some HOT
          BABES and a shitload of BUD LIGHT.EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAYIn QUICK CUTS, the guys hit the slopes:
          -- In his ridiculous snowsuit, Nick skis down the mountain.
          With the new snowfall, he expertly glides along.
          -- Jacob applies some LIP BALM and flies down the mountain on
          a SNOWBOARD. People glare at him with confused expressions.
          -- Adam uses the snowplow method to slowly descend. He's a
          beginner skier. He takes the time to look at the
          surroundings and notices a YOUNGER, HOTTER CROWD skiing
          today. Lots of BLONDE SKI BUNNIES wearing PASTEL colors.ADAMWell this place has improved.
          -- In the lift line, Lou passes a GUY wearing a BIG HEADBAND.LOUReally, asshole?INT. GONDOLA - DAYAdam shares a gondola with Nick, as they make their way up
          the mountain. A DUDE IN SUNGLASSES sits across, napping.
          Adam takes a FLASK out of his backpack. He and Nick look
          over their shoulders like scheming kids as they take a nip.31.ADAMI'm really glad we stayed. It's
          gonna be good to get away for a
          couple of days.(QUALIFYING BEAT)I mean not like I want to be away

          but watching you talk with Courtney-NICKYou're gonna be fine. You'll
          settle in, get the premium cable
          package - the usual deal.
          Adam nods.NICK (CONT'D)You'll wake up every morning,
          comforted by the fact that your
          wife doesn't wield her family's
          wealth over your head like a
          hangman's noose.
          Adam looks concerned, as Nick wistfully goes on...NICK (CONT'D)You'll breathe the air of life,
          making the occasional decision -
          maybe get some lawn furniture. How
          about steak for dinner? Yes, let's

          Nick stares off into the distance.ADAMNick?32.NICKSorry, I lost myself there.DUDE IN SUNGLASSES (O.S.)Coke?
          Adam and Nick look at the guy across from them, who presently
          offers his SKI GOGGLES, on which is a mountain of COCAINE.NICKThat is a lot of cocaine.ADAMI feel like we're in Scarface.
          Only with skiing.(THINKS)Skiface.DUDE IN SUNGLASSES(SNIFFS)Take it. It's good shit.NICKI'm gonna pass.ADAM(DECLINES)Yeah, I'm good.
          The dude removes his sunglasses. He has a dead look in his
          eyes, studying Nick and Adam.DUDE IN SUNGLASSESYou guys a couple of spazzes?ADAMSpazzes?DUDE IN SUNGLASSES(VERY ANGRY)Yeah, dipstick. You narcs? You

          The dude flips out a SWITCHBLADE.DUDE IN SUNGLASSESYou show me you're not spazzes.33.NICKWe're not spazzes.
          The dude extends the coke once more.DUDE IN SUNGLASSESShow me.EXT. MOUNTAIN / TOP - MOMENTS LATERAt the top of the mountain, Nick looks WIDE AWAKE. Adam, on
          the other hand, looks COKED OUT OF HIS SKULL. He sniffs,
          fidgets, clenches his jaw, and looks generally "up."NICKAdam, you gotta chill. You just
          did one line.ADAMI've never ridden the horse before.NICKYou're not riding the horse. The
          horse is heroin.

          I'm riding, but it's the best
          animal of all time. I feel great!
          Adam uses his SKI POLES to push off the top of the mountain
          and he goes FLYING DOWN THE SLOPE.NICKAdam! Jesus.EXT. MOUNTAIN / SKI TRAIL - DAY - CONTINUOUSAdam TUCKS down, still CLENCHING HIS TEETH. He PICKS UP
          SPEED as he flies down the mountain like a racer.FURTHER UP THE MOUNTAINNick has to pull up and slow down in the name of safety.34.ON ADAMHe zips along, never changing course or slowing. He BARELY
          MISSES a few TREES. But he can't stop himself before --HE BARRELS INTO A SMOKING HOT CHICK!The collision knocks Adam and the girl to the ground and
          finally stops Adam's hyper-speed descent.
          Adam gets up and shakes the cobwebs.ADAMWhat a rush!
          He notices the girl on the ground and goes to help her up.ADAM (CONT'D)Oh wow, are you OK?SMOKING HOT CHICKNo thanks to you, asshole!IN SLOW MOTION --The girl stands up in a very hot and awesome manner, SHAKING
          THE SNOW from her luxurious blonde hair. It twinkles in the
          sunlight. As she turns to face Adam,
          NORMAL SPEED RESUMES. And he sees who it is:ADAM(MIND BLOWN)Jennie O'Keefe!
          Jennie squints at Adam, trying to place him.JENNIEDo I know you?
          He stares at her, not believing what he's seeing. He still
          looks loopy from the coke.
          Just then, a a too-blond, mirror-sunglass-wearing, feathered
          hair, striped-jumpsuited guy (BLAINE) SKIS UP and GRABS ADAM.BLAINEI'm gonna serve you a knuckle
          sandwich, airhead.(TO JENNIE)You all right, babe?JENNIEI think so.35.Blaine's TOADIES (TAD and CHAZ) ski up behind him, as Blaine
          ANGRILY RIPS Adam's lift ticket from his jacket.BLAINEYour lift ticket's been revoked.
          Blaine throws it on the ground and laughs to his friends.ADAM(a la Lethal Weapon 2)
          Diplomatic immunity.
          Blaine looks confused, as Adam RIPS Blaine's lift ticket, but
          he ends up RIPPING BLAINE'S JACKET too.ADAM (CONT'D)Sorry, I was trying to... you can
          probably patch that up.
          Blaine PULLS Adam close by the collar and clenches his fist.BLAINEYou're dead meat, scumbag.
          Just then, SNOW POWDER flies in Blaine's face. Blaine lets
          go of Adam, as Jacob snowboards up and stops short, coming to
          his brother's side.JACOBThere you are! My brother's had a
          few too many triple Venti nonfat
          lattes if you know what I mean.
          (genuine, to Adam)
          Are you OK?
          Adam nods. Blaine looks confused. CHAZ and TAD look
          enamored with Jacob.CHAZDude, they let you bring a
          skateboard on the mountain?JACOBIt's a snowboard. You know - no
          wheels.TADGenius! Man, not to get all fag on
          you, but I'm digging your fresh
          threads, bro.
          Adam and Blaine look equally confused with what's going on.
          Jacob takes the compliment well, like he deserves it.36.JACOBThank you. It's mostly North Face.
          A little EMS.CHAZWhatever it is, it works.TADTotally. What are you doing with
          this boner? You should be skiing
          with us. Like permanently.
          Blaine looks really annoyed with his friends.BLAINEGuys!TADI mean, that's if Blaine thinks
          it's cool and everything.
          Blaine takes a deep breath, annoyed.BLAINE(TO JACOB)Get your spaz brother out of here.
          And for his sake, I don't wanna see
          him back on my mountain.CHAZ(EAGER)You're welcome any time though!
          Adam picks up his BACKPACK, which fell off during the

          had the biggest crush on her--
          Blaine grabs the bag out of Adam's hand and SHOVES ADAM away.BLAINEThis is mine now.
          Adam looks at Blaine angrily, but Jacob holds him back.JACOBCome on. Let's just go.
          Jacob ushers Adam off the slope, as Blaine shoulders the bag.37.INT. PINE VALLEY INN / LOBBY - DAYAdam and Jacob walk in the front door. Gone are the children
          and old people. The living room off the lobby presently
          hosts what appears to be an amazing 80s RETRO PARTY. A radio
          plays Miami Sound Machine's "Conga."
          Girls and guys wear printed sweaters, feathered dos, and neon
          leggings. It's something out of a mid-80s Aspen photo shoot.
          Nick walks in behind them, looking as confused as them. He
          turns up his palms and shakes his head, at a loss for words.ADAMWhat is going on?
          Lou strolls up to the guys, with his arms around TWO HOT
          CHICKS. He looks elated.LOUGuys! I'm so glad you're here. I
          want to introduce you to Michelle
          and Sandy. These lovely ladies are
          having a roller skating party next
          weekend and no offense, but fuck
          your wedding -- I'm totally coming
          back. By the way...
          Lou rolls out a ZIPLOCK BAG full of cocaine.LOU (CONT'D)There's coke everywhere around
          here. This place rules!
          Lou dips into the coke and rubs it on his gums and we:CUT TO:INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - LATE AFTERNOONThe suite looks a little "fresher." The furniture is the
          same, but everything's in better shape. It looks almost new.
          Adam, Jacob, and Lou sit in the main room with the TV on, as
          Nick emerges from a bedroom.JACOBHas anyone else noticed that things
          around here are weird as shit?
          Adam and Nick nod. Lou shakes his head.38.LOUDon't you ruin this. If you wake
          me from this dream, I'll kill you.ADAM(IGNORING LOU)What do you think happened?JACOBI have no idea, but look...

          For a moment, the guys sit there in stunned silence. Then...LOU(with genuine emotion)
          We're in 1971.ADAM(CORRECTING HIM)We're in 1987.
          Everyone looks stunned and dazed.JACOBWhat are we gonna do? I have plans
          next weekend.ADAMWe all have plans. It's my fucking
          wedding!NICKNow hold on, we don't know for sure
          that we're in 1987.
          The TV shows a (real) COMMERCIAL for the COMMODORE 64
          computer, with a JINGLE that SINGS: "Are you keeping up with
          the Commodore, 'cause the Commodore's keeping up with you..."39.When it's over...NICK (CONT'D)OK, we're in 1987.
          Adam stands up, completely losing it.ADAMWhat the FUCK is going on?!
          Nick stands up and calmly takes charge.NICKEveryone relax. I think I know
          what's happened. And when we're
          done discussing it, we're all gonna
          feel a lot better.
          Everyone looks to Nick, who seems to have the answer.NICK (CONT'D)Two words: black hole.
          He lets it hang in the air for a moment, as if it's suddenly
          going to gel for everyone. But the guys look confused.NICK (CONT'D)I saw a special on the Science
          Channel. And guess what?
          Sometimes this happens.ADAMThis happens?NICKYes. And the best thing for us to
          do is to stay put. The universe
          will eventually reverse itself and
          work out this little glitch.
          Nick sits down, looking satisfied in his know-it-all-ness.ADAMThis is a big glitch.JACOBYeah, you're an idiot. Black holes
          are in space. Not at a ski resort.LOU(HOPEFUL)So does this mean we get to go to
          girls' locker rooms and see them
          naked and they can't see us?40.JACOBNo, we traveled through time.
          We're not invisible.

          of how we got here for a moment--NICKBlack hole.ADAMHow are we supposed to get back?

          Whitesnake on the juke, PAC MAN on the tables, and cheap
          beers in the mugs - this is an amazing brew pub.
          Our guys sit in the back, wearing PINE VALLEY LODGE shirts.
          There are MANY EMPTIES on the table and they look VERY DRUNK.
          In a roped-off area in the corner, a cocky YOUNGER PHIL (the
          one-armed bellhop) wields a CHAINSAW that he uses to carve an
          ICE SCULPTURE, impressing the bar crowd. He has BOTH ARMS.NICKHoly shit. It's that bellhop.JACOBShould we warn him?ADAM(COVERS EYES)I don't want to see this go down.
          Phil TOSSES THE CHAINSAW IN THE AIR and...
          He expertly CATCHES IT, seamlessly continuing to carve. A
          GIRL leans in and gives him a kiss.LOUFuck that guy.
          ON THE STAGE, TWO GIRLS compete for wettest t-shirt. They
          both decide that NO T-SHIRT is the wettest option.NICKGod bless our country.ADAM(in a daze)

          think it's making a difference.43.ADAMSeriously, we have to get back.
          (kinda losing it)
          We seriously have to get back!
          The guys subdue Adam, as a BIG-HAIRED WAITRESS brings drinks.WAITRESSHere ya go, guys. Three Buds, one
          Bartles and James.
          The guys all stare at her like she's a museum artifact.WAITRESS (CONT'D)What? I have lipstick on my teeth?
          Nick sips his WINE COOLER, feeling the eyes of the others on
          him.NICKHey, if it's available, I'm
          ordering it. I always wanted one
          of these when I was little.
          The waitress puts down the CHECK. Jacob picks it up,
          realizing something.JACOB(to the waitress)
          Can you give us a second?
          She walks away, as Jacob turns to the guys.JACOB (CONT'D)This is gonna be a problem.
          He takes out his wallet, showing his CREDIT CARDS and CASH.JACOB (CONT'D)Guys, we're in trouble. Our cards
          aren't gonna work and our new money
          looks fake.
          The guys look concerned, but then Nick notices something:A TABLE FULL OF JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN.NICKI've got an idea.
          As Nick gets up and approaches the businessmen, Adam looks
          around the room and by the bar, he spots --44.Jennie.
          He stares at her from across the room. Lou and Jacob notice.ADAMI still can't believe it's really
          her!LOUShe's aged remarkably well.(REMEMBERS)Oh, right. Why don't you just go
          talk to her?ADAMI should go talk to her. To
          apologize, of course. You know,
          nothing inappropriate.LOUSure...
          Adam GETS UP. He slowly makes his way over across the room.
          Jennie is talking to TWO OTHER GIRLS as Adam approaches. He
          lurks near them like a creep. Jennie eventually notices him,
          as he keeps stealing glances. She doesn't look happy.JENNIE(TO ADAM)Listen putz, if you're gonna try to
          attack me again, my boyfriend will
          be here soon. He'll kick your ass.
          Adam tries to be casual.ADAMNo, no. No ass kicking. I just
          wanted to say I'm sorry about
          earlier. I lost control of the old
          skis there.(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)Looks like I shoulda taken another
          one of your classes!JENNIEWhen did you take my class?ADAMCertainly not when I was a kid! I
          mean, that would make no sense!

          tools. It was a couple years ago.
          Jennie looks very suspect of Adam.JENNIEYeah, OK. Have a good night.
          Jennie starts to walk away with her friends.ADAM(TOO FRIENDLY)Hey, where ya going?
          She ignores him, but one of her friends quietly lags behind.JENNIE'S FRIEND(quietly, to Adam)
          Are you with that guy over there?
          She discretely points out Jacob.ADAMYeah, he's my brother.

          this address. Make sure he comes
          with you. He's way boss!

          Nick points out the Japanese Businessmen.NICK(PROUDLY)Sold them my iPod.

          DUCK HUNT, while in another area, people make out and dance.
          Adam, Nick, Lou, and Jacob walk in the front door. They have
          updated their "looks" with 80s sweaters and other era-
          appropriate attire. They all look ridiculous, except for
          Jacob, whose youth lends him hipster appeal.ADAMThis sweater makes me look like a

          In a corner, Phil puts his ARM in a SHARK TANK. Just as the
          shark goes to bite, he PULLS HIS ARM OUT, unscathed. A small
          crowd claps. Our guys are confused and upset.NICKWas this like an 80s thing?LOUIf he doesn't lose that arm soon,
          I'm gonna take it from him myself.

          Lou confers with Michelle before answering.LOUDare.57.Sandy and Jacob confer, figuring out the dare. Lou meets
          Jacob's eyes -- he smiles, knowing Jacob has his back.SANDYOK, we dare Lou to put a Twizzler
          up his ass.
          Lou stands up and angrily points at Jacob.LOUYou son of a bitch! Have you ever
          played this game before? It's
          supposed to be awesome!
          Lou nevertheless grabs a TWIZZLER from the snack bowl and
          shoves it down the back of his pants. His face contorts
          uncomfortably and he is almost on the verge of tears.LOU (CONT'D)This is a horrible thing you're
          doing and I hope you never have to
          experience what I am currently
          going through.
          Lou sits down and Michelle consoles him.MICHELLEYour turn! Truth or dare?
          Before Sandy can even confer with Jacob:JACOB(SMILES)Truth.

          I don't care. Whatever. This is
          not the point of the game.MICHELLEOK, each of you has to tell your
          darkest, most personal secret.
          Lou crosses his arms and shakes his head.58.JACOBOh wow, all right. Let me think.
          I've never told anyone this, but I
          was afraid of scary movies until I
          was 18. I even ran out of the
          theater a couple of times.SANDYOh you poor thing! Come here...
          She takes Jacob's head to her chest and strokes it gently.
          Lou makes a jerk-off gesture.SANDY (CONT'D)(SHY)I'm not sure I should tell mine.MICHELLECome on! You have to!SANDYOK, but you can't laugh.LOU(WHO CARES)We promise. Let's hear it.SANDYSo this one time me and my friend
          Lori took a train to Baltimore. It
          was the summer and we wanted to
          party, but we had no money. So
          Lori found this businessman who was
          also looking for a good time and
          told him that we'd give him a half
          and half for seventy-five dollars.
          You know -- a suck and fuck.
          Lou and Jacob look shocked with the MATTER OF FACT
          storytelling. Michelle smiles. She's heard it before.SANDY (CONT'D)Anyway, we get him up to his room
          and Lori starts going down on him,
          but I really wasn't into it. So I
          broke a piece of the bathroom
          mirror and used it to cut his
          artery on the-heck. Right here...
          She rubs Jacob's neck, pointing it out.SANDY (CONT'D)He bled for about an hour before he
          died.(MORE)59.SANDY (CONT'D)Afterwards, we took his wallet to

          earning accolades from all his new fans.
          To Adam's RIGHT --
          The truth or dare game devolves, as Michelle PIERCES LOU'S
          EAR. He screams in pain, but at the end, he has a GOLD STUD
          in his RIGHT EAR. Lou points at Jacob.LOUFuck you, your turn.JACOBThat's the gay ear, you know.
          As Adam looks STRAIGHT AHEAD --
          He sees Jennie all by herself, browsing the hosts' CASSETTE
          TAPE COLLECTION. Adam takes a moment to check himself. Then
          he reaches for his DRINK and GULPS THE WHOLE THING, before
          getting up and WALKING OVER to her, catching her off guard.ADAMSo I lied to you earlier. I wasn't
          here for a power tool convention.

          could handle power tools.60.ADAMThe truth is, Jennie, I've always
          liked you. But I've never really

          Adam shrugs, indicating he might as well tell her.ADAMI came here from the future.
          She rolls her eyes - she's heard all the one-liners.JENNIELet me guess. You want to beam me
          up to your spaceship built for two?

          world? Give me a break, spaz.
          I've heard them all.
          She turns away. Adam goes after her.ADAMNo! No spaceship. No astronaut
          pants. Just regular time travel.
          With normal pants.JENNIEOK, what's the punch line?
          An ARM comes from behind and CHOKES ADAM. It's Blaine.BLAINEI thought I told you to stay off my
          mountain, partner!JENNIEBlaine, stop!BLAINEYou talking to my girl? Huh? I
          can't hear you.
          Adam fights to breathe, as Blaine chokes him harder.61.JENNIEBlaine, that's enough! Let him go!
          He can't breathe!
          Blaine doesn't stop. He smiles like an asshole.BLAINECan't breathe? Is that right? Can
          you breathe, partner? What's that?
          I can't hear you. Just tell me you
          can't breathe and I'll stop.
          Adam still struggles. Blaine just shrugs.BLAINE (CONT'D)He's not saying anything. I guess
          he can breathe.
          Jennie pulls on Blaine's arm, trying to free Adam.BLAINE (CONT'D)Babe, stop. Jennie, stop!
          Blaine turns and accidentally ELBOWS JENNIE in the face. She
          goes down. He releases Adam and turns to help her.BLAINE (CONT'D)Baby, I'm sorry.

          There's no Red Bull in 1987.

          -- In the SUITE, Adam gets dressed in his GEAR.
          -- On a SMALL HILL, Jacob demonstrates some moves on skis.
          Adam doesn't get it. He's keeps falling.
          -- On the hill, Jacob teaches Adam how to SNOWBOARD. Adam is
          having an easier time standing up on the snowboard.
          -- The guys keep Adam awake and use a homemade SCALE MODEL of
          the mountain to formulate a plan, a la Iron Eagle.
          -- Back on the hill, Jacob and Adam snowboard next to each
          other. Adam makes it by a couple of obstacles. Jacob looks
          proud of him.
          -- The guys play an ATARI SKI GAME, trying out a strategy.
          Jacob uses a POINTER, looking disappointed.

          snowboard, kicking up snow and HIGH-FINING Jacob.EXT. MOUNTAIN / TOP - DAWNSLO-MO HERO SHOT of our four guys, as they ascend the top of

          as Jacob helps him strap into the snowboard.JACOBJust stick to the plan and you're

          Adam looks at Jacob seriously for a moment.ADAMJacob, I'm sorry for not always
          being the big brother I should've
          been. I was away at college, Mom
          gave you my Sega - there were a
          whole host of issues.
          Jacob nods and speaks genuinely to Adam too.86.JACOBI know. I'm sorry too. I put a
          few things before my family and

          all the more sweeter. Like a Peach

          Adam is on a SNOWBOARD.BLAINEWhat's that?ADAMYou're not afraid of getting beat
          by a guy on a skateboard, are you?87.BLAINEI've seen you in action. You're

          skiier, which he pretty much is. Adam looks toward Jacob,
          who demonstrates the proper CROUCH. Adam slowly picks up
          speed, starting at about one mile per hour.
          Blaine looks back and can't believe how easily he's gonna
          coast to victory.ADAMHere goes nothing.
          Instead of weaving back and forth, Adam just stays in the
          crouch, PICKING UP SPEED. He recklessly PASSES BLAINE,
          despite the many TREES and OBSTACLES on the course.
          He BEARS DOWN AND TRAVELS LIKE A BOLT OF LIGHTNING!
          Blaine finds the guts to alter his STYLE, skiing more
          recklessly too. He begins catching up to Adam.
          Blaine skis up next to Adam - they're both going full force.BLAINEYou can't beat me! I was born on
          this mountain!ADAMI was born in a hospital like a
          normal baby!
          Adam bends down and picks up even more speed, NARROWLY
          MISSING trees and rocks. Blaine tries to keep up.
          Adam has the finish line in his sights, when he rolls the
          dice once too often. His SNOWBOARD GETS SNAGGED on a rock

          LIMB OVER LIMB, like a snowball going down the mountain.
          With 50 YARDS to go, Blaine bears down and tries to catch
          Adam. It's gonna be close.
          At the FINISH LINE, Adam's CRUMPLED BODY passes the line
          first. Blaine pulls up, pissed off to lose the race.
          Adam's momentum carries him forward another 50 yards, where

          anything after the night I put her
          through. But she stayed.INT. ADAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHTAdam lays on the couch, his head in Lily's lap. She feeds
          him a little GATORADE. He keeps it down... for a moment.
          Then he turns and VOMITS into a BUCKET on the floor.ADAM (V.0.)She saw me at my worst and she
          stayed.
          Lily holds the bucket, as Adam pukes into it.BACK TO:INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - DAYNick, Lou, and Jacob look sick.ADAMDon't you see? This is more than a
          sandwich. It represents all that
          shit. All that puke.92.LOUKeep the sandwich.JACOBThis is disgusting.ADAMShe gave me this as a reminder of
          her love.(THINKS)Or to give me horrible diarrhea so
          I didn't leave the room during the
          bachelor party. But mostly as a
          reminder of her love.
          Adam holds up the sandwich.ADAM (CONT'D)This is the reason I need to go
          home.
          Adam stands up and walks toward the door with the sandwich.ADAM (CONT'D)I'm gonna go prep the tub.
          Lou holds up a BAG OF CHIPS.LOUDo you have any stories about these
          chips or can I eat them?EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - CONTINUOUSAdam walks outside, taking a bite of the SANDWICH. He finds
          Jennie waiting in the TUB.JENNIEThere you are!ADAMJennie! What are you doing here?JENNIEMaking good on a rumor.
          Jennie STANDS UP in the tub and she's TOPLESS.
          Adam DROPS THE SANDWICH, shocked.ADAMWhoa.93.Jennie continues talking, shamelessly exposing herself.JENNIEWhen I saw you win that race
          against Blaine, everything changed
          for me. I realize now that I
          deserve more. I deserve a winner.(SEDUCTIVE)Come and get your prize.
          Adam reaches next to the tub and hands her a ROBE.ADAMYeah, I... can't.
          She covers up, embarrassed.JENNIEOh my god. I missed my
          opportunity.ADAMNo, I'm not sure there ever was an
          opportunity. Jennie, you're
          terrific. You've brought me so
          many moments of joy, you'll never
          know. But I shouldn't have given
          you the wrong idea.
          Jennie looks sad and vulnerable, as Adam talks.ADAM (CONT'D)The truth is there's a girl I need
          to go see. We have plans to spend
          the rest of our lives together.
          And I can't wait any longer.
          (listening to himself)
          And I'm totally cool with it.
          Adam smiles, feeling the rush of knowing he's ready. But
          then he sees how sad Jennie is. He moves closer to her.ADAM (CONT'D)One day, you're going to find the
          right guy who's willing to give up
          everything and travel across time
          and space for your love.
          She nods and tears up a little bit, as Adam HUGS her.JENNIE(EMOTIONAL)I would totally blow you right now.94.ADAMI know you would.DISSOLVE TO:EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - LATER THAT AFTERNOONThe guys stare at the tub, which continues to bubble, even
          though it's not plugged in.NICKWe don't have to go yet, Adam.
          Things are just getting fun.JACOBAnd we can do whatever we want
          without any real consequences.
          That's a lot to give up.ADAM(NODS)That's how I know I'm doing the
          right thing.
          Adam reaches in his backpack, but can't find the Red Bull.
          He turns it inside out and shakes it -- nothing.JACOBWhere's the Red Bull?BLAINE (V.0.)You looking for this?
          Across the patio, a drunk, disheveled Blaine holds the CAN.BLAINE (CONT'D)You couldn't leave well enough
          alone, could ya? You couldn't just
          win the race and call it a day?
          You had to have Jennie too.ADAMI don't want Jennie.BLAINEThat's funny. I don't want this
          soda, either.
          Blaine smiles like an asshole. Adam's face goes desperate,
          as Blaine OPENS THE CAN and DRINKS THE WHOLE THING.ADAMNooooo!95.Adam runs at Blaine and tackles him to the ground. On the
          ground, Adam BEATS THE LIVING HELL out of Blaine, messing up
          his face. It makes the Jared Leto scene from Fight Club look
          tame. Eventually, Adam's friends pull him off.
          Adam crawls to the Red Bull can and it's empty.ADAM (CONT'D)(DESPERATE)Why?
          Lou takes Blaine's pulse.LOUHoly shit! You may have killed
          this guy! No wait... wait... I've
          got a pulse. Eh, so much for that.
          Nick puts his hand on Adam's shoulder.NICKI'm sorry man. I'm really sorry.ADAMThe Red Bull's gone. He fucked us.JACOBNot necessarily.
          Everyone looks toward Jacob.JACOB (CONT'D)The Red Bull isn't really gone.
          (points to Blaine)
          It's in him.
          A beat, as everyone sorta gets it.NICKIt's worth a shot.TIME CUT TO:EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - MOMENTS LATERAdam, Nick, and Jacob sit in the tub. Adam crosses his
          fingers.
          Lou stands outside the tub, fully dressed.ADAMCome on, Lou.96.LOUNah, I'll take a rain check.NICKWhat are you talking about?LOUListen, your lives at home sound
          all beautiful and happy with your
          barbecues and swimming pools and
          "oh, that sandwich reminds of some
          gay shit I did one time."
          Adam and Nick don't look thrilled to be reduced to this.LOU (CONT'D)But my life back there sucks. And
          in case you haven't noticed, my
          life here fucking rules. So I have
          a coke problem? I'll go to rehab.
          I have no money? I'll stop winning
          sex and start winning dollars.
          Lou DRAGS BLAINE by the foot closer to the tub.LOU (CONT'D)Guys, I was tailor-made for 1987.
          And you'll excuse me, but I value
          banging young chicks way more than
          all of your friendships combined.(THEN)No offense.
          Adam, Nick, and Jacob kinda nod and understand.ADAMYeah, no, I get it.
          Lou goes around and gives them all hugs.NICKMakes perfect sense, man.
          Lou squeezes Jacob's shoulder.LOUI don't hate you as much as I used
          to.JACOB(a little emotional)
          I hate you a little less also.

          asshole puking in a hot tub! Here
          goes nothing!
          Lou does the HEIMLICH MANEUVER on Blaine. It takes ONE...
          TWO... THREE THRUSTS until Blaine PUKES IN THE TUB! For a
          second, it's just a BIG SPLASH of VOMIT and nothing else.NICKOK, well maybe if we--
          A BRIGHT FLASH CONSUMES THE SCREEN! And when it dies down,
          we see Adam, Nick, Jacob (and the floating puke) in the hot
          tub where we left them.
          Only Lou is missing.ADAMWhat happened? Did it work?NICKI didn't feel anything.JACOB(DISAPPOINTED)Guys, look.
          They see PEOPLE walking by, wearing COLORFUL FLARED-OUT SKI
          ATTIRE. The place looks the same as it did two seconds ago.NICKDammit. Even the deck furniture's
          the same. We fucking blew it. It
          didn't work.ADAMWhere's Lou?LOU (O.S.)Right on schedule!
           Lou walks toward them, but there's a lot that's "off" about
           him, including HAIR PLUGS, JEWELRY, and a SHITLOAD OF PLASTIC
          SURGERY (including a fixed NOSE) that makes him look at once
          older and younger.NICKAhhh!98.LOUOh, the face, eh? I was curious
          how you'd react.(DISAPPOINTED)Didn't think you'd be scared.ADAMLou?LOUYou're damn right it's me.ADAMWhat happened?LOUYou just traveled 23 years in three
          seconds. Took me 23 years. It's

          for me, please?LOUI'll give you the short version,

          First of all, to settle an old bet,
          time most definitely has been
          moving forward. It is exactly
          three days since you've arrived
          here in beautiful Havenhurst.
          Jacob looks at Nick.JACOBTold you.LOUSecondly, I'm filthy rich. Made

          fuck kids.
          Two YOUNG HOTTIES walk by and wave at Lou.LOU (CONT'D)I do fuck them, though. Haven't
          gone above 24 years old in 10 years
