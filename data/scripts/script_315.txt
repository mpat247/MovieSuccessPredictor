The Crying GameThe Crying GameFADE IN:EXT. CARNIVAL - DAYA loudspeaker playing Percy Sledge's "When a Man Loves a
Woman," as we see a carnival in the distance - with a Ferris
Wheel turning round and round.

A black man is by a stall. On his arm is an Irish girl with
blond hair. The black man is drunk, and is tossing rings
around a bowling pin.JODYAnd that's cricket, hon.

An attendant hands him the teddy bear. It looks ridiculous in
his huge hands. He gives it to the girl.JODYYou want it?GIRLSure.JODYDoesn't matter if you don't.

He puts his arm around her and drags her on.JODYJody won't be offended. Jody's never
            offended. What'd you say your name was?GIRLJude.JODYJude. Suits you, Jude.JUDEThe teddy bear?JODYNo, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And
            it's June. Jude in June.

He comes to a small canvas tent with a sign on it - TOILET.2.JODYGotta piss, Jude.

He holds her hand.JODYDon't run off, Jude.JUDEYou don't know me, do you?

Jody walks inside the canvas flap and vanishes from sight. We
can still see his hand, holding Jude's. She leans against the
canvas, looking bored.JODY(inside)
          What if I did?JUDEYou'd know I wouldn't run off.

She stands there, listening to the sound of him urinate. Her
eyes flick around the carnival. They settle on a tall dark-
haired man in a dark jacket. He nods.JODYNever pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.JUDEYou didn't?JODYAnd you know what?JUDETell me, Jody

He staggers out, buttoning up.JODYIt's nice.

He goes to kiss her. She turns her head away.JUDENot here.JODYWho gives a fuck.JUDEYou never know.3.She pulls him over toward the water.JODYI never know nothing.JUDEPeople. They could be looking.

Jody follows her, as she walks backward, drawing him on. He
moves his hips to a song as Jude leads him over the beach,
under a train trestle.JUDECome and get me, soldier --JODYWhatever you say, Jude...

He sinks down on his knees toward her. She wraps her arms
around his neck and kisses him. Jody writhes on top of her,
fumbling with his belt. Jude cocks one eye upward. A shadow
falls across them.

CLOSE ON JODY, kissing her. A gun is put to his head. He
turns around, drunkenly.JODYWhat the fuck --

The gun whacks him across the cheek and he falls sideways.

Jude scrambles to her feet and darts like an animal through a
field.

Jody feels his cheek. He can see her blond head vanishing
among the fields. He looks up and sees a group of men around
him. The tallest of them, Fergus, cocks the gun.INT. CAR - DAYA mini, driving down a country road. Two men in the front,
three in the back.

On the floor of the car Jody lies, with three pairs of feet
on top of him, a black bag over his head and the barrel of a
gun dangling close to his face. Fergus holds the gun. He is
smoking a cigarette. His movements are slow and somewhat
innocent.FERGUSSo what's your name, soldier?4.JODYFuck you.FERGUSYeah.EXT. SMALL FARMHOUSE - EVENING.INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.Jody pulled through and tied to a chair. Maguire, a small
lean man, talks to him through the hood.MAGUIREThe situation is simple. You're being
          held hostage by the Irish Republican
          Army. They've got one of our senior
          members under interrogation in
          Castleraigh. We've informed them that if
          they don't release him within three days,
          you'll be shot. You'll be treated as our
          guest until further developments. Have
          you anything to say?

Jody is motionless under the black hood.FERGUSGive him a cup of tea.MAGUIREDo you want a cup of tea?

He still says nothing.DISSOLVE.All the men are drinking tea. The blond woman comes in with a
plate and some food on it.FERGUSSee does he want some.JUDEDo you want some food?

Jody sits as still as a grave, saying nothing.DISSOLVE.Late at night -- it is dark. The men are sleeping. Fergus is
sitting by a chair, gun in his hand, watching the prisoner.
Jude comes in, with a flashlight.5.FERGUSHey -- what's he like?JUDEHorny bastard.FERGUSDid you give him it?JUDEThere are certain things I wouldn't do
          for my country.FERGUSHave a look at him.JUDECan't.FERGUSPoke him or something. See if he's still
          alive.JUDEHe's all right.FERGUSHasn't moved for twelve hours. Go on.
          Have a heart.

She moves over to him. She prods him in the legs with her
foot. He doesn't move. Then she lifts the hood ever so
slightly, to peer inside. Suddenly the man moves like
lightning, jerking his head down so the hood comes off,
throwing his body, tied to the chair, over Jude.JODYYou fucking bitch -- you fucking whore --

He pins her to the ground, his body bent with the chair. He
writhes on top of her in a grotesque parody of love. She is
screaming and the room is alive, each man awake, grabbing
guns, screaming.MAGUIRETurn the fucking thing off --EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.Fergus follows Jude out a back door, holding her by the arm.FERGUSYou all right?6.JUDEFucking animal.

She takes in huge gobs of air.FERGUSYou don't know that.JUDEFucking do. I had him all over me.

He touches her face.FERGUSTough work, that.JUDESomeone's got to do it.

She rubs her hand on his chest.JUDENah, it was a breeze. Just thought of
          you.

She sidles closer, coming on to him.JUDEAnd you know what, Fergus? One of you
          made me want it...

She puts her lips to his neck.FERGUSWhich one?

She doesn't answer. They embrace.EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING.A hot summer's day. There are tall hedges all around the
house. Fergus leads Jody, still bound and hooded, over toward
a greenhouse.INT. GREENHOUSE - DAYDusty tomato plants and vines everywhere. Broken glass. The
sun pouring through. Fergus leads Jody over to a wrought iron
chair and sits him in it. He sits opposite, gun on his lap.
Fergus takes some sandwiches out of a brown paper bag. He
holds one out toward him.7.FERGUSEat something, would you?JODYCan't.FERGUSWhat do you mean you can't?JODYCan't eat through a canvas bag.

Fergus walks over to him, lifts the hood up so his mouth is
revealed, and pushes the sandwich toward his lips. Jody eats,
slowly.JODYThis is a farce, man.FERGUSHow is it a farce?JODYI seen your fucking face.FERGUSSo, what do I look like?JODYYou're the one about five ten with the
           killer smile and the baby face.FERGUSAm I?JODYYeah. And the brown eyes.

Fergus pushes the last crumbs of the sandwich toward Jody's
mouth.JODYYou're the handsome one.

Jody eats the last bits.JODYThank you, handsome.FERGUSMy pleasure.8.EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAYJude makes her way from the door toward the greenhouse. She
is carrying a pot of tea and two cups.INT. GREENHOUSE - DAYIt is sweltering now in the greenhouse. CLOSE ON JODY'S
COWLED HEAD. The hood is drenched with sweat.JODYI can't fucking breathe, man. Be a
          Christian, will you?

Jude comes into view.JODYTell him to take the hood off, honey...

Jude says nothing. Lays the tea on the ground.FERGUSHow did you know it was her?JODYI can smell her perfume.

Jude pours out the tea.JUDESee, if we took the hood off, we'd have
          to shoot you. As it is, you've got a
          fifty-fifty chance.JODYThought you liked me, bitch.JUDEIt was fun while it lasted.JODYNice lady.

His breathing becomes labored.JODYPlease, man, I'm suffocating in here.FERGUSCan't we take it off?JUDEHave to check with himself.9.Fergus gives her the gun.FERGUSYou look after him.

Jody's head follows Fergus while he leaves.JODYDon't leave me with her, man. She's
          dangerous...

Jude smiles, holding the gun on her lap.INT. FARMHOUSE - DAYFergus enters. Maguire and the others. Maguire has a
newspaper, which has a headline regarding the kidnapping.MAGUIREMade the front page. They'll move now,
          the fuckers.FERGUSRequest permission to take the hood off,
          Tommy.MAGUIREWhy would you do that?FERGUSThe poor whore's suffocating in the heat.MAGUIRESo?FERGUSAnd anyway, he's seen our faces.MAGUIREYou sure?FERGUSHe described me down to a T. Knows what
          Jude looks like.

Maguire reads the paper.FERGUSTommy --10.MAGUIREYou're his keeper. If you don't mind him
          seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the
          only one he looks at.FERGUSThanks.MAGUIREIt's your decision.INT. GREENHOUSE - DAYJude, drinking tea, looking at Jody sweating. Fergus enters.
He puts his arm casually around her.FERGUSLeave us, Judie.JUDEMy pleasure.

She goes. Fergus walks to Jody and slowly takes the hood off.
Jody looks up at him, his face bathed in sweat. He breathes
in mighty gulps of air. He smiles.JODYThank you, soldier.

Fergus smiles.JODYNever thought fresh air would taste this
          good.

Fergus pours out a cup of tea and brings it to his lips.JODYNow, if you took the ropes off, I'd be
          able to feed myself.FERGUSNo fucking way.JODYOnly joking.

Fergus drinks.JODYYou know, I was wrong about one thing.11.FERGUSWhat's that?JODYFive ten. Brown eyes. But you're no
            pinup.FERGUSNo?JODYNope. Not handsome at all.FERGUSYou trying to hurt my feelings?JODYNo. It's the truth.FERGUSWell, I could say the same about you.JODYCould you?FERGUSBut I won't. We're more polite around
            these parts.JODYSo I've noticed.

Fergus looks at him. Jody isn't smiling anymore. Fergus goes
back to his seat and drinks his tea. He fingers the gun on
his lap.JODYHey --FERGUSWhat is it now?JODYYou're going to have to do it, aren't
            you?FERGUSDo what?JODYKill me.12.FERGUSWhat makes you think that?JODYThey're going to let that guy die. And
you're going to kill me.FERGUSThey won't let him die.JODYYou want to bet?FERGUSI'm not a gambling man.JODYAnd even if he doesn't die -- you can't
just let me loose.FERGUSWhy can't we?JODYNot in your nature.FERGUSWhat do you know about my nature?JODYI'm talking about your people, not you.FERGUSWhat the fuck do you know about my
people?JODYOnly that you're all tough undeluded
motherfuckers. And that it's not in your
nature to let me go.FERGUSShut the fuck up, would you?JODYAnd you know the funny thing?FERGUSNo, what's the funny thing?JODYI didn't even fancy her.13.FERGUSDidn't look like that to me...JODYShe's not my type.

He looks at Fergus.JODYC'mere.FERGUSNo.JODYAh, c'mere. I want to show you something.FERGUSWhat?JODYMy inside pocket.

Fergus holds the gun to his face. He fishes inside Jody's
inside pocket.JODYTake out the wallet.

Fergus's hand emerges with a wallet.JODYOpen it.

CLOSE ON THE WALLET. Credit cards, army identification
photograph.JODYInside. There's a picture.

Fergus takes out a picture. It is of Jody, in cricket whites,
smiling, holding a bat. Fergus smiles.JODYNo, not that one. There's another.

Fergus takes out another picture of Jody and of a beautiful
black woman, smiling.JODYNow she's my type.14.FERGUSShe'd be anyone's type.JODYDon't you think of it, fucker.FERGUSWhy not?JODYShe's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit
          you.FERGUSNo?JODYAbsolutely not.FERGUSShe your wife?JODYSuppose you could say that.

Jody chuckles.FERGUSYou make a nice couple.JODYDon't I know it.FERGUSSo what were you fucking around for,
          then?JODYYou fuckers set me up. That bitch --FERGUSShe's a friend of mineJODYOkay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar.
          I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here
          anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my
          hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't
          like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe
          I'll get to understand.FERGUSWhat?15.JODYWhat the fuck am I doing here.FERGUSWhat the fuck were you doing here?JODYI got sent.FERGUSYou could have said no.JODYCan't. Once I signed up.FERGUSWhy did you sign up?JODYIt was a job. So I get sent to the only
place in the world they call you nigger
to your face.FERGUSShouldn't take it personally.JODY(He imitates a Belfast accent)
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No
use telling them I came from Tottenham.FERGUSAnd you play cricket?.JODYBest game in the world.FERGUSEver see hurling?JODYThat game where a bunch of paddies whack
sticks at each other?FERGUSBest game in the world.JODYNever.FERGUSThe fastest.16.JODYWell, in Antigua cricket's the black
          man's game. The kids play it from the age
          of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies
          from the age of five. Then we moved to
          Tottenham and it was something different.FERGUSHow different?JODYToffs' game there. But not at home.     .

Fergus looks at him.JODYSo when you come to shoot me, Paddy,
          remember, you're getting rid of a shit-
          hot bowler.FERGUSI'll bear that in mind.

He keeps looking at him.FERGUSAnd by the way, it's not Paddy. It's
          Fergus.

Jody smiles.JODYNice to meet you, Fergus.FERGUSMy pleasure, JodyEXT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT.Fergus leads Jody outside, holding the gun against him.FERGUSTake it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by
          that tree.JODYTree.

He walks toward it, breathing heavily.JODYYou've got to loosen my hands.17.FERGUSCan't.JODYWell then, you're going to have to take
          my dick out for me, aren t you?

Fergus, in the dark, stands motionless, looking at him.JODYCome on, man, I'm going to wet my pants!

Fergus turns him around and unzips his fly.JODYTake the fucker out, man, I'm dying --

Fergus takes Jody's penis out.

Jody takes two steps toward the wall.JODYI gotta lean forward or I'll dribble all
          over myself. Will you hold my hands for
          me.

Fergus holds his hands from behind, so Jody can lean forward.
Jody now pisses with immense reliefJODYNow, that was worth waiting for.FERGUSHurry up, would you?JODYThese things take time, Fergus.

He shakes his body.JODYIt's amazing how these small details take
          on such importance...

He steps back.JODYNow put it back in.FERGUSGive us a break.18.JODYI can't do it! It's only a piece of meat.
             For fuck's sake, it's got no major
             diseases.

Fergus puts Jody's penis back in his pants and zips him up.JODYThank you. I had a case of the clap two
             years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in
             all it's served me well.FERGUSShut up, would you?JODYI'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend you,
             Fergus.

Fergus leads him hack toward the greenhouse.INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT.Fergus leads Jody back to his chair.JODYFergus?FERGUSYeah?JODYThanks. I know that wasn't easy for you.

He begins to laugh.FERGUSThe pleasure was all mine.

Fergus begins to laugh, without knowing why.EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.Maguire, walking out of the house, woken by the sound of
laughter.INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT.Jody, still laughing. Suddenly the hood is slammed back over
his head.

Maguire, standing there in the dark, looking at Fergus.19.MAGUIREWhat the fuck is this?FERGUSIt's nothing. He's just got a sense of
          humor, that's all.MAGUIREYou're on duty. Keep your fucking mouth
          shut. Go in and get some sleep.

Fergus gets up slowly, walks toward the door.JODYYeah. Get some sleep.EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.Fergus, walking toward the house. He looks back and sees the
figures of Maguire and Jody in the dark, in absolute silence.INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.Fergus sleeping.INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT.Jody sleeping. Maguire sitting with an Armalite in his hands,
watching him.EXT. FARMHOUSE AND FIELDS - DAYThe sun coming up over the low hills around the farmhouse.INT. GREENHOUSE - DAYFergus enters, with a tray and some breakfast. Maguire is
sitting where he sat before, stock-still.FERGUSDid he talk?

Maguire shakes his head.FERGUSDidn't make you laugh?

Maguire shakes his head.FERGUSHere. Have some breakfast.

He hands Maguire a plate. Jody stirs.20.JODYGood morning, Fergus?

Maguire looks hard at him.MAGUIRESo he knows your name?FERGUSI told him.MAGUIREAre you all there?

He rises, and drags Fergus out the door.FERGUSBack in a minute, JodyEXT. GREENHOUSE - DAYMAGUIREYou'll have minimal contact with the
          prisoner, do you hear me?FERGUSYes.MAGUIREAnd do you know why?FERGUSWhy?MAGUIREBecause tomorrow we might have to shoot
          him, that's why.

Maguire goes back to the house.INT. GREENHOUSE - DAYJody sitting with the hood on again. Fergus enters.JODYThey giving you trouble, Fergus?

Fergus says nothing. He takes a plate and brings it toward
Jody21.JODYIt happens. Y'see, there's two kinds of
             people. Those who give and those who
             take.

Fergus lifts up Jody's hood to expose his mouth and begins to
feed him.JODYAh, take the thing off, man.

Fergus says nothing and keeps feeding him.JODYIt's okay. I understand. Don't mind if I
             prattle on, do you?

Fergus shakes his head and says nothing.JODYI will take it by your silence that you
             don't.

He eats. Fergus feeds himself, then feeds more to Jody.JODYTwo types, Fergus. The scorpion and the
             frog. Ever heard of them?

Fergus says nothing.JODYScorpion wants to cross a river, but he
             can't swim. Goes to the frog, who can,
             and asks for a ride. Frog says, "If I
             give you a ride on my back, you'll go and
             sting me." Scorpion replies, "It would
             not be in my interest to sting you since
             as I'll be on your back we both would
             drown." Frog thinks about this logic for
             a while and accepts the deal. Takes the
             scorpion on his back. Braves the waters.
             Halfway over feels a burning spear in his
             side and realizes the scorpion has stung
             him after all. And as they both sink
             beneath the waves the frog cries out,
             "Why did you sting me, Mr. Scorpion, for
             now we both will drown?" Scorpion
             replies, "I can't help it, it's in my
             nature."

Jody chuckles under his hood.22.FERGUSSo what's that supposed to mean?JODYMeans what it says. The scorpion does
              what is in his nature. Take off the hood,
              man.FERGUSWhy?JODY'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.

Fergus walks toward him and pulls off the hood. Jody smiles
up at him.JODYSee? I was right about you.FERGUSDon't be so sure.JODYJody's always right.INT. GREENHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON.Both men dozing in the heat.JODYWhere would you most like to be now, man?FERGUSDoesn't matter where.JODYCome on, man. If this shit was all over.FERGUSHaving a pint in the Rock.JODYYou lack imagination, Fergus. Think of
              something more alluring.FERGUSLike what?JODYLike having a pint in the Metro --

Fergus laughs.23.FERGUSHaving two pints in the Rock.JODYHaving a pint in the Metro, and Dil's
having a margarita.FERGUSWho's Dil?JODYMy special friend.FERGUSOh, yeah.JODYWe got simple tastes, you and me.FERGUSThe best.JODYBut you fellas never get a break, do you?FERGUSDo you?JODYOh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're
finished. But you guys are never
finished, are you?FERGUSWe don't look on it like that.JODYI've often wondered how you do it.FERGUSDepends on what you believe in.JODYWhat do you believe in?FERGUSThat you guys shouldn't be here.JODYIt's as simple as that?FERGUSYes.24.Jude enters.JUDEPut that thing back on him, Fergus.FERGUSHe's hot.JUDEDoesn't matter if he's hot. Just cover
          the fucker up.JODYHave you no feelings, woman?JUDEYou shut your face --

She pulls the hood down over him.JUDEYou're heading for trouble, Fergus --JODYHe's a good soldier, Jude.

She whacks him with a pistol.JUDEI said shut the fuck up --JODYHe believes in the future --INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT.Jody, sitting in the hood. Fergus lifts it a bit; Jody's
mouth, with blood now in his lips.FERGUSIs it bad?JODYNo. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know
          that, Fergus?FERGUSI didn't.JODYSome kinds of women are...25.FERGUSShe can't help it.JODYDil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.FERGUSYou liked her?JODYPresent tense, please. Love her. Whatever
            she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus.
            Will you think of her too?FERGUSDon't know her.JODYWant you to do something, Fergus.FERGUSWhat?JODYIf they kill me --FERGUSDon't think that way.JODYBut they will. As sure as night follows
            day. They have to. I want you to find her
            out. Tell her I was thinking of her.

Fergus is moved. He can't reply.JODYSee if she's all right.FERGUSI don't know her.JODYTake her picture. C'mere.

Fergus walks toward him.JODYTake it. In the inside pocket.

Their faces, close to each other as Fergus searches out her
picture.26.JODYTake the whole lot. I won't need it.FERGUSI told you not to talk that way --JODYGo to Millie's Hair Salon in
          Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a
          margarita. Don't have to tell her who you
          are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --FERGUSStop it --

The door opens. Maguire is there, with another.MAGUIREVolunteer?

Fergus turns toward him.MAGUIREWe need you inside.

Fergus walks toward Maguire and the other man walks forward,
takes his seat. Fergus, unseen by Maguire, puts the wallet in
his pocket.INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.Maguire, Jude, Fergus, and the others.MAGUIREWe've had word. They've used every trick
          in the book on him. He's starting to
          talk. You're going to have to do it in
          the morning.

Maguire lights a cigarette. Fergus looks at him and nods.MAGUIREYou OK about that?FERGUSI'm a volunteer, am n't I?MAGUIREGood. I was beginning to have my doubts
          about you for the last few days.JUDENot the only one --27.MAGUIREShut up, Jude. You best get some sleep
              tonight, Fergus.FERGUSPeter.MAGUIREWhat?FERGUSRequest permission to guard the prisoner
              tonight --JUDEYou're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.MAGUIREShut the fuck up, Jude.

He turns back to Fergus. He puts his arm on Fergus's
shoulder.MAGUIREWhy do you want to do that for?FERGUSWould make me feel better about it.MAGUIREYou sure about that?FERGUSI'm sure.MAGUIREOkay. You're a good man, Fergus.

Fergus leaves.INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT.Fergus takes his place in the chair beside Jody.

Jody begins to laugh under the hood. It turns into the sound
of crying.FERGUSDon't.JODYI'm sorry.28.The crying stops.JODYHelp me.FERGUSHow can I?JODYI don't know. Just help me. Give me a
          cigarette.

Fergus takes out a cigarette, lights it, and lifts up Jody's
hood so he can smoke.JODYDon't even smoke, you know that? It just
          seemed the right thing to do.

Fergus watches him puff the cigarette, the hood just above
his lips. Jody coughs, but keeps the cigarette in his lips.
Fergus gently takes the cigarette from his mouth.FERGUSGo to sleep now.JODYI don't want to sleep. Tell me something.FERGUSWhat?JODYA story.FERGUSLike the one about the frog?JODYAnd the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.FERGUSWhen I was a child...JODYYeah?FERGUSI thought as a child. But when I became a
          man I put away childish things...JODYWhat does that mean?29.FERGUSNothing.JODYTell me something, anything.

Fergus is silent; his eyes wet.JODYNot a lot of use, are you, Fergus?FERGUSMe? No, I'm not good for much...EXT. FIELDS - MORNING.The farmhouse covered in mist. The sun coming through it.EXT. GREENHOUSE - MORNING.Maguire opens the door to the greenhouse and clicks the
chamber of his gun. Fergus has a gun in his hand. He checks
the chamber.

Fergus takes Jody, whose hands are still tied behind his
back, by the elbow.FERGUSStand up, now --

Jody rises. Fergus leads him through the door, past Maguire.MAGUIREI wish to say on behalf of the Irish
          Republican Army --

Fergus turns with sudden fierceness.FERGUSLeave him be --

He pulls Jody through the fields.EXT. TREES - MORNING.Fergus pushing Jody through a copse of trees, the gun at his
back.JODYTake the hood off, Fergus --FERGUSNo.30.JODYI want to see a bit. Please, please.
          Don't make me die like an animal.

Fergus pulls the hood off. Jody looks around him. He has a
cut lip where Jude struck him.

Fergus prods him on with the gun. Jody stumbles forward.
Fergus is all cold and businesslike.JODYI'm glad you're doing it, do you know
          that, Fergus?FERGUSWhy?JODYCause you're my friend. And I want you to
          go to the Metro --FERGUSStop that talk now --JODYHurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?FERGUSThe fastest.JODYFaster than cricket?FERGUSCricket's in the halfpenny place.JODYSo if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat
          you, is there?FERGUSYou won't run.JODYBut if I did... you wouldn't shoot a
          brother in the back --

Jody suddenly sprints, and, loosening the ties on his hands,
then freeing them, he is off like a hare. Fergus screams in
fury after him.FERGUSJODY!!!31.Fergus aims, then changes his mind and runs.FERGUSYou stupid bastard --JODYWhat you say, faster?FERGUSI said you bastard -- stop --JODYGot to catch me first --

Fergus gains on him -- stretches his arm out -- but Jody
sprints ahead again -- as if he has been playing with him. He
laughs in exhilaration. Fergus pants behind him, wheezing,
almost laughing.JODYUsed to run the mile, you know -- four
              times round the cricket pitch -- what was
              that game called?FERGUSHurling --JODYWhat?FERGUSHurling --

Jody runs, whipping through the trees -- always ahead of him.JODYCome on, Fergie -- you can do it -- a bit
              more wind --

Fergus grabs his shoulder and Jody shrugs it off, gaining on
him again.JODYBit of fun, Fergus, eh?

And suddenly the trees give way. Jody turns, laughing, to
Fergus.JODYTold you I was fast --

Fergus is panting, pointing the gun at Jody32.JODYDon't do it.

And suddenly a Saracen tank whips around the corner, hits
Jody with the full of its fender. His body flies in the air
and bounces forward as another tank tries to grind to a halt
and the huge wheels grind over him.

Fergus, screaming, "No-!" He almost moves forward, then sees
soldiers spilling from the tank around the body. Fergus turns
and runs.EXT. TREES - DAYFergus whipping through the trees, his body crouched low as
he runs.INT. GREENHOUSE - DAYTinker sitting in the greenhouse. A helicopter screams into
view through the panes and automatic fire comes from it,
shattering every pane in seconds and tearing Tinker to bits.INT. FARMHOUSE - DAYBullets whipping through every window, taking chunks from the
masonry, tearing the walls apart. Maguire, Jude, and the
others on the floor, scrambling for weapons.EXT. TREES - DAYFergus, hearing the gunfire, runs through overhanging
branches till eventually he is hidden from sight.EXT. CARNIVAL ON THE MONAGHAN BORDER - DAWN.A forlorn-looking building over nondescript fields.

An old man wheels a bicycle slowly toward it; a rusty car
appears; and Fergus gets out of it.TOMMYFergus!FERGUSYou're back in the pink, Tommy? How're
             you keeping?INT. CARAVAN - DAYThe old man pouring whiskey into a teacup.33.TOMMYYou'll notice I've asked you nothing.FERGUSThat's wise, Tommy.TOMMYAll right, then. I like to be wise.

He pours Fergus more whiskey.TOMMYSo what do you need, Fergus?FERGUSNeed to go across the water.TOMMYDo you now.FERGUSNeed to lose myself awhile.TOMMYAha.

He looks at Fergus and lights a cigarette.

He puffs.TOMMYThere's a man I know ships cattle to
             London.EXT. DUBLIN BAY - EVENING.The ferry, churning into the sunset.FADE TO BLACK.INT. BUILDING SITE - DAYFADE UP into an elegant, empty Georgian room, covered in
clouds of dust. A figure among the clouds of dust, hacking at
a wall with a sledgehammer. It is Fergus, dressed in
laborer's overalls, covered in dust. He is knocking the
bricks from an outer wall. He works furiously and
relentlessly, like a machine.

We see the wall, with the hammer striking it. One brick falls
away, then another. Daylight pours through the clouds of dust
and the growing hole.34.Fergus's face, as he works.

The hole. More bricks falling away. Through the clouds of
dust and the streams of daylight we now see a patch of green.

Fergus's face, working. His rhythm slows.

The hole. More bricks fall away. Then the hammer stops. The
dust begins to clear.

His face.

The jagged hole. The dust drifts across it, revealing a
cricket pitch, with tiny sticklike figures running on the
green.EXT. HOSTEL - DAYFergus, returning from work, crosses the street, and enters
through a white door.INT. HOSTEL - DAYFergus dressing. He puts on a cheap suit, like any country
boy in a big city. He takes Jody's wallet from the trousers
of his overalls. He flips it open, sees the picture of the
soldier and Dil. He puts it in the pocket of his suit.EXT. STREET - DAYFergus walking down a street looking for an address. Some
distance down the street is a sign -- MILLIE'S UNISEX HAIRSALON.EXT. STREET - DAYFergus, standing as the crowds go by him, looking in the
window. He has the picture in his hand. We see Dil from his
point of view, then Fergus walks inside.INT. HAIR SALON - DAYFergus enters. The door gives a loud ping.A GIRLWe're closing. I'll see you tomorrow, Dil

She leaves the salon.DILYou want something in particular?35.FERGUSJust a bit of a trim...

Dil checks her watch and stubs out a cigarette.DILCome on...

She gestures toward a chair. Fergus sits down. She comes
toward him and fiddles with his hair.

She pushes his head back into a basin behind him. She begins
to knead his hair in hot water and shampoo.DILSomeone recommend you?FERGUSIn a way.DILWho?FERGUSGuy I work with.DILWhat's his name?

Fergus can't think of an answer. The hands with the purple
nails run over his scalp.FERGUSDoesn't the water get to your nails?DILWhat's it to you?FERGUSNothing.

Fergus, sitting up. She begins to cut.DILYou American?FERGUSNo.DILNot English.36.FERGUSNo.DILScottish?FERGUSHow'd you guess?DILThe accent, I suppose.FERGUSAnd what's it like?DILLike treacle.

She imitates his accent saying it. Fergus laughs.DILNice laugh.

Dil raises Fergus's head up, with his new-cut hair and holds
a mirror up behind his head so he can see the back. He looks
like a young London stockbroker. The hair salon around them
is empty.DILThat should make her happy.FERGUSWho's she?DILDon't know. Who is she?EXT. HAIR SALON - EVENING.Fergus emerges from the shop. He takes one last look through
the window where Dil is taking off her smock, touching up her
hair, etc. It is as if she has forgotten all about him. He
walks off through the crowds and then ducks into a doorway.

The doorway of the shop. Dil comes out, dressed in a pair of
high heels, a very short skirt, different, more raunchy
clothes on her than we saw inside. She locks the glass door
and walks down the street, across the road, and into a pub
called the Metro. Fergus follows.37.INT. METRO - EVENING.Half full, with an after-work crowd. Dil makes her way
through it.BARMANHi, DilDILHiya, hon.

She sits down at the bar. Fergus comes toward the bar and
takes a seat.BARMANWhat'll it be?FERGUSA bottle of Guinness.

Dil, looking at Fergus.DILSee that, Col?COLSee what, Dil?DILHe gave me a look.COLDid he?

Fergus blushes. He buries himself in his drink.DILJust cut his hair, you know.COLYeah?DILWhat you think?COLNice.

Fergus throws his eyes toward her again. She has her face
turned away, but sees him in the mirror.DILThere, he did it again.38.COLSaw that one.DILWhat would you call it?COLNow, that was a look.

She eyes Fergus in the mirror.DILAsk him to ask me what I'm drinking.

The barman, with infinite weariness, approaches Fergus.COLShe wants to know do you want to know
              what she's drinking.

Fergus is about to talk when she pipes up.DILA margarita.

The barman mixes it. She stares at the mirror, staring at
Fergus, who is trying to avoid her eyes. The barman hands her
the drink.DILNow he can look.... Ask him does he like
              his hair, Col.COLShe wants to know, sir, do you like your
              hair.FERGUSTell her I'm very happy with it.DILHe's Scottish, Col.COLScottish?FERGUSYeah.DILWhat'd he say, Col?39.COLHe agreed that he was.DILWhat do you think his name is?COLI've no thoughts on the subject.FERGUSJimmy.DILJimmy?COLThat's what he said. Jimmy.DILHi, Jimmy.FERGUSHiya, Dil

A burly man sits down beside her. He puts his hand on her
knee.MANSing the song, Dil --

She slaps the hand away.DILFuck off, Dave.DAVEC'mon, babe! You know what I like...
           Easy!

She turns back to Fergus and finds his seat empty.EXT. METRO - NIGHT.Fergus, standing across the road from the pub. He is
sweating. Dil comes out of the pub. She looks this way and
that, as if searching for Fergus. Fergus stands back into a
shadow.

Dave, the burly man, comes out. He grabs her by the elbow.
She shrugs him off. She walks off. Dave follows, grabs her by
the elbow again. The sense of an old argument. Dave suddenly
strikes her across the face with his open palm.40.She leans her head against a wall. Dave then puts his arms
around her, consoles her.EXT. STREET - NIGHT.Dave walking, holding Dil by the arm. The street is
dilapidated, full of squats. They stop outside a door. Dil
opens the door with a key from her purse and they both walk
inside.

Fergus stands there, observing.

A light comes on in an upstairs room. Dil enters; we see her
shadow in silhouette behind the curtain and the shadow of
Dave coming in behind her. He begins to remove her blouse.
She stands absolutely still as he does so.

Fergus backs away, then walks off.INT. HOSTEL - NIGHT.Fergus, in bed. Fade to black as we see Jody as a bowler,
running in slow motion, toward the camera. He releases the
ball; we see Fergus in bed, breathing heavily.INT. SITE - NEXT DAYFergus takes a break and watches the batsman hit a ball. He
imitates the batsman's motion with his sledgehammer. Then a
voice interrupts him.DEVEROUXSo Pat's a cricket fan, eh?

Fergus turns. We see Tristram Deveroux, a young Sloane type
in a three-piece suit, whose house it is. Beside him is
Franknum, the cockney foreman.FERGUSIt's not Pat. It's Jim.DEVEROUXJim, Pat, Mick, what the fuck. Long as
           you remember you're not at Lords.

Fergus resumes work.INT. METRO - NIGHT.It is now crowded with people, black, white, punky and street
chic, a lot of leather All the women are heavily made-up.
Someone is singing from the tiny stage and rows of cheap
colored bulbs are flashing around it.41.From the way Fergus walks through, it is obvious he has never
been here at night. He seems most out of place in his cheap
suit, making his way through the crowd to the bar.AT THE BAR.Fergus looks through the odd crowd, but can't find Dil. Col,
the barman, sees him and smiles.COLSo can we consider you a regular, sir?FERGUSIs that good or bad?COLWell, you get to say, The usual, Col.
          Things like that.

Col pushes a colored cocktail with one of those Japanese
umbrellas toward him.COLSo let's call this the usual.FERGUSThanks.

Fergus reaches for his wallet to pay, but Col interrupts.COLNo, no. It's on me.

Fergus tries to pretend he's familiar with the drink, and by
implication, whatever are the norms of the place. He lifts
the glass to his mouth, but the umbrella keeps getting in the
way.COLTake it out, if you want.

Fergus takes out the umbrella. He holds it in one hand and
drinks with the other.COLYou came to see her, didn't you?

Fergus shrugs. He takes out a cigarette. A guy in leather to
his left smiles at him.COLSomething I should tell you. She's --42.FERGUSShe's what?

The barman looks up toward the stage.COLShe's on.THE JUKEBOX.A hand presses a button. The needle selects a disk. A song by
Dave Berry, "The Crying Game."AT THE BAR.Fergus looks up. Close-up of Dil's hand, as music begins,
making movements to the music. We see Dil, standing on a
stage, swaying slightly. She seems a little drunk. She mimes
to the song. She mouths the words so perfectly and the voice
on the song is so feminine that there is no way of knowing
who is doing the singing. She does all sorts of strange
movements, as if she is drawing moonbeams with her hands.

The crowd seems to know this act. They cheer, whether out of
approval or derision we can't be sure.

Fergus watching.

Dil singing, noticing him. She comes to the end of the song.
The crowd cheers.

Fergus, watching her make her way through the crowded bar,
toward him.DILHe's still looking, Col.COLPersistent.DILGood thing in a man.COLAn excellent quality.DILMaybe he wants something.COLI would expect he does.43.DILAsk him.COLAsk him yourself.

She looks at Fergus directly, sits down next to him.DILSo tell me.

Fergus says nothing. He shrugs.DILEverybody wants something.FERGUSNot me.DILNot you. How quaint. How old-fashioned
          and quaint. Isn't it, Col?

Col shrugs.DILYou old-fashioned?FERGUSMust be.

The burly man comes up to her.MANGot the money, Dil?DILFuck off, Dave.DAVEYou fucking promised.DILDid I?DAVEYou fucking did.

He suddenly jerks her roughly off the stool, spilling her
drink.DAVEDidn't you? Well, come on!44.He drags her through the crowd. In the mirror, Fergus watches
them go. The barman eyes him.COLIt takes all types.FERGUSSo who's he?COLHe's what she should run a mile from.FERGUSThen why doesn't she?COLWho knows the secrets of the human heart.

Fergus suddenly stands and makes his way to the door.EXT. PUB - NIGHT.Fergus comes out. A black bouncer is there, but there is no
sign of Dil. He walks a few yards and hears voices down an
alley. He looks up it.P0V - ALLEY.We see Dil pushing Dave away. He grabs her, turns her
roughly.DAVEDon't be like that --DILYou heard me --

She beats his arms away. Money falls on the ground. She
staggers away from him. He picks up the money, then runs
after her.DAVEGot very fucking grand, haven't we --

He tries to pull her back.DAVETalk to me, you stupid bitch --

They both bump into Fergus, who just stands there and doesn't
move an inch. She smiles.45.DILHi.FERGUSHi. You forgot your bag.

He holds it up to show her.DILThank you.DAVEWho the fuck is he?DILJimmy.DAVEIt's him, isn't it?DILMaybe.

Dave eyes Fergus. Fergus grabs his wrists and upends him on
the ground.DILSee, they get the wrong idea.DAVE(from the ground)
          Cunt.

Fergus puts his foot on Dave's neck.FERGUSWhat was that?DILThey all get the wrong idea.DAVECunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt.DILCharming.

Dave grabs for her ankle. She kicks his hand away. Fergus
presses down his foot. He looks to Dil.FERGUSWhat'll I do?46.DILBreak his neck.

Fergus presses his foot.DILNo, don't.

She bends low to Dave.DILHe's going to take his foot off slowly,
            David. Then you're to go home, like a
            good boy. You hear me?DAVECunt.

But his voice is softer. Fergus removes his foot. Dil grabs
his arm.DILCome on, honey.

She draws him away.EXT. METRO - NIGHT.They walk out of the alley.FERGUSYou all right?DILYes, thank you.FERGUSWhat was that all about?DILHe wants me to perform for him.FERGUSPerform?DILYou know.FERGUSYou on the game?DILGod no.

STAIRCASE OUTSIDE DIL'S FLATFergus and Dil climb slowly upstairs.DILYou want me to ask you in, right?FERGUSNo, I didn't --DILBut I'm not cheap, you know that? Loud,
          but never cheap.

There is a movement lower down the staircase. We see Dave,
holding his neck.DAVEFucking dumb dyke carrot cunt.

Dil leans close to Fergus.DILIf you kissed me, it would really get his
          goat.

She tilts up her face. Fergus kisses her, tenderly.DILNow, if you asked me to meet you
          tomorrow, it would really drive him
          insane.FERGUSWhere?DILHalf-five. At Millie's.

She goes in and closes the door. Fergus stands and looks down
at Dave, who turns to leave.EXT. HAIR SALON - DAYDil walks out of the salon, smiling, and walks toward Fergus.48.DILGive me that look again.FERGUSWhat look?DILThe one you gave me in the Metro.

Fergus takes a bunch of flowers from behind his back. She
holds them, with theatrical feeling.DILDarling, you shouldn't have.

She laughs and leans toward him and kisses him in a
classically old-fashioned way. The girls inside the salon
pull back a curtain, and they all clap.FERGUSWhat's that about?DILThey're jealous.FERGUSWhy?DILI wonder.

She takes his arm and walks off with him.INT. INDIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT.Fergus and Dil looking at their menus. A waiter places drinks
on their table, then leaves.DILNow's the time you're meant to do
          something, isn't it?FERGUSLike what?DILMake a pass or something. Isn't that the
          way it goes?FERGUSMust be.49.EXT. STREET - NIGHT.They are walking in an alleyway toward her house.DILYou got a special friend, Jimmy?FERGUSHow special?DILYou want one?

And suddenly a car drives very fast toward them, headlights
on. Fergus pulls her into a doorway to avoid it.FERGUSJesus Christ!DILJesus.

The car continues down the road, stops, and then screeches
off.FERGUSThat Dave?DILThe things a girl has to put up with.

She looks down toward where the car has pulled away.DILI'm frightened, Jimmy. That's not like
          him.EXT. DIL'S FLAT.A car pulls up behind Dil and Fergus.DILPiss off, Dave!FERGUSTough guy, huh? Are you going to be all
          right on your own?DILI'm not on my own, am I?

She touches his cheek.50.DILCome on up, would you?INT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT.Dil comes in in the darkness. Fergus stands like a shadow in
the doorway. The light comes on; she takes off her raincoat.DILWon't hurt you to come in.

Fergus enters slowly. He looks around the room; there is an
exaggerated femininity about everything in it.DILWould you like a drink?FERGUSYes, please.DILWhat'll it be?FERGUSWhiskey.

She goes into a small kitchen. Fergus looks at the
mantelpiece and sees a picture of Jody. The camera tracks
into the soldier's smiling face. Then into Fergus's face. His
reverie is broken by the sound of a voice outside -- Dave's.

She comes through with two drinks.FERGUSSomeone out there.DILJesus fucking Christ.

She opens the window door, and we see Dave on the street, in
a neck brace.DILHey, Stirling fucking Moss --DAVEIt's Dave.

She goes back into the room and begins taking things up.DAVETalk to me, Dil --51.DILSure, Dave --DAVEPlease, Dil --

She flings things down: men's clothes, leather trousers, a
suitcase, a teddy bear.DILTake your clothes.DAVEDon't throw my clothes out the window!DILFuck off back to Essex!DAVEFucking mad!

Fergus looks to the man down in the street, a parody of
rejection with his things in his arms.DAVEDon't chuck my clothes out!DILTake your fucking goldfish, too!

Dil grabs a large goldfish bowl and flings it down. The bowl
breaks to bits on the pavement. Goldfish thrash around in the
street.DAVEYou fucking bitch!

He tries to pick up the flapping fish in his hands.DAVEMurderer!

Upstairs, Dil closes the window shut.DILSorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a
           brace?FERGUSMust be in love to manage that.DILDoesn't know the meaning of the word.52.Fergus stands as Dil hands him a glass.FERGUSHe lived here with you?DILTried to. Sit down, will you?

Fergus walks past the photograph and sits down. He looks from
her to the picture.FERGUSWhat about him?

He nods toward the picture. She looks down into her drink.DILHe was different.FERGUSHow different?DILAs different as it's possible to be.FERGUSTell me about him.DILNo.FERGUSShouldn't I go?DILYes.

And they fall into one another's arms. She stretches up with
her whole body over him. They grow suddenly and violently
passionate.

They fall into the cushions of the couch onto the floor. The
photograph above them seems to smile. He draws up her dress
with his hands. She suddenly pulls away.DILNo --FERGUSDid you do that to him?

She comes up toward him once more. She puts her mouth close
to his ear.53.DILYou want to know how I kissed him?FERGUSYes...DILAre you jealous of him?FERGUSMaybe.DILThat's good...

She opens the buttons on his shirt and her mouth travels down
his chest. Fergus tries to draw her up toward him, but her
hand reaches up to his mouth and presses his head back while
her other hand undoes his pants. She kisses his stomach; her
mouth moves down his body. Fergus stares at the picture of
Jody. Jody's eyes seem to burn through him. Dil raises her
head and kisses his mouth. There are tears in his eyes.FERGUSWhat would he think?DILCan't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He
          was a soldier. Went there like a fool.

She sits in front of the mirror.FERGUSDo you miss him?DILWhat do you think?FERGUSI think you do.DIL(dreamily)
          You say that like a gentleman.FERGUSDo I?DILLike you're concerned.

Fergus gets up and stands behind her, gently pushes the hair
from her face.54.DILBut you can t stay, you know that?FERGUSDidn't think I could.DILA real gentleman...

She embraces him.FERGUSShouldn't you be in mourning?DILI am.

She sits back down in front of the mirror. Fergus leaves. She
reapplies her lipstick.INT. METRO - NIGHT.Singer in a blue dress. Dil and Fergus by the bar. Both
drinking drinks with umbrellas. Dave comes up behind them
with his neck brace.DAVELook, I'm sorry.DILFuck off, Dave.DAVENo, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm
          sorry, didn't I?DILYeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?

Fergus nods. He stands. Dave steps two feet back.FERGUSI was only going to ask her for a dance.

Fergus takes Dil's arm.FERGUSShall we?

The woman is singing.

As they circle, people begin to look at them admiringly. Dil
holds her cheek close to his.55.FERGUSDid he come here too?DILIs this an obsession of yours?FERGUSMaybe.DILHe did sometimes.FERGUSDid he dance with you?

Dil doesn't answer. Looks at him out of the corner of her
eye.DILSo what do you want with me, Jimmy?FERGUSWant to look after you.DILWhat does that mean?FERGUSSomething I heard someone say once.

She draws back and looks at him.DILYou mean that?FERGUSYeah.

She dances closer.DILWhy?FERGUSIf I told you, you wouldn't believe me.

In the bar, people singing along with the music. Col sings.
Dave sitting at the bar, sulking.DILYou're not having me on, are you? 'Cause
          Dil can't stand that.56.FERGUSNo.

She puts her cheek against his. Dave, at the bar, slams his
drink down.DILAnd she does get very upset...

Dave stands up to leave. On the stage the act finishes. Dil
draws Fergus back to the bar.AT THE BAR.Col, the barman, pours her drink.DILOne for him, too.

Col pours and smiles.DILDrink.FERGUSWhat is this?DILI'm superstitious. Drink.

He drinks. He grimaces. She throws it back in one.DILCan't leave me now.FERGUSAha.DILThe thing is, can you go the distance?FERGUSDepends what it is.DILNo, depends on nothing.

She takes the bottle herself and fills their glasses. She
slams it back. He sips.DILIn one.57.She tilts his glass back. He swallows it in one.INT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT.She enters; Fergus walks in slowly. He looks from the cricket
whites that are hanging up behind a curtain to the
photographs.DILWhat you thinking of, hon?FERGUSI'm thinking of your man.DILWhy?FERGUSI'm wondering why you keep his things.DILTold you, I'm superstitious.

She turns toward him and undoes her hair. It falls around her
shoulders.FERGUSDid he ever tell you you were beautiful?DILAll the time.

Fergus runs his hand down her throat.DILEven now.FERGUSNo...DILHe looks after me. He's a gentleman too.

She draws him behind a curtain toward the bed, pulls him
down. They kiss passionately.DILGive me one minute.

She walks into the bathroom. Fergus lies there, looking at
the picture, listening to the sound of running water. She
comes out then, dressed in a silk kimono. She looks
extraordinarily beautiful.58.He reaches out his hand and grasps hers. He draws her toward
him. He begins to kiss her face and neck.FERGUSWould he have minded?

She murmurs no. His hands slip the wrap down from her
shoulders.

CLOSE ON HIS HANDS, traveling down her neck, in the darkness.
Then the hands stop. The kimono falls to the floor gently,
with a whisper. The camera travels with it, and we see, in a
close-up, that she is a man.

Fergus sits there, frozen, staring at her.DILYou did know, didn't you?

Fergus says nothing.DILOh my God.

She gives a strange little laugh, then reaches out to touch
him. Fergus smacks the hand away.FERGUSJesus. I feel sick --

He gets up and runs to the bathroom. She grabs his feet.DILDon't go, Jimmy --

He kicks her away. He runs into the bathroom and vomits into
the tub.

She crouches on the floor.DILI'm sorry. I thought you knew.

He retches again.DILWhat were you doing in the bar if you
              didn't know -- I'm bleeding...

She lights a cigarette.

Fergus runs the taps. He washes his face, rinses his mouth.59.DILIt's all right, Jimmy. I can take it.
          Just not on the face.

Fergus slams the door shut. She is sitting on the couch, the
kimono round her once more, looking very much like a woman. A
trace of blood on her mouth.DILY'see, I'm not a young thing any
          longer.... Funny the way things go. Don't
          you find that, Jimmy? Never the way you
          expected.

Fergus comes out of the bathroom.FERGUSI'm sorry.

She looks up. Some hope in her face.DILYou mean that?

And he makes to go. She grabs him to stop him.DILDon't go like that. Say something...

He pulls away from her. She falls to the floor.DILJesus.

He drags himself away and runs down the stairs.INT. FERGUS'S FLATFergus in bed. Flash to shot of blackness, Jody grinning in
cricket whites, throwing the ball up and down in his hand.INT. METRO - NIGHT.The place is hopping. Fergus enters. He now sees it as he
should have seen it the first night -- as a transvestite bar.
He makes his way through the crowds. All the women too-
heavily made-up. Some beautifully sleek young things he looks
at he realizes are young men. He makes his way to the bar
where Dil is sitting, nursing a drink with an umbrella in it.
Her face is bruised. She is wearing dark glasses.

As he walks toward her she sees him in the mirror. She talks
to Col the barman.60.DILHe's back, ColCOLHi.DILDon't want any of those looks, Col. They
            don't mean much.COLStop it, Dil --DILNo. Tell him to go fuck himself.

Fergus sits. Col turns to him.COLShe wants me to tell you go fuck
            yourself.FERGUSI'm sorry.

There is a tear running down her cheek, under the dark
glasses.DILTell him to stop messing Dil around --FERGUSDil --DILTell him it hurt --FERGUSI have to talk to her, Col --COLSays he's got to talk to you --

Fergus touches her arm.FERGUSCome on, Dil --DILWhere?

She whips her arm away.61.DILTell him again, Col. Go fuck himself --

She walks into the crowd, toward the door.

Fergus leaves.EXT. STREET - NIGHT.Fergus, walking outside Dil's place. The blinds in her room
are down and the light is on inside. We see her outline,
pacing up and down behind the blinds, smoking a cigarette. We
hear the song "The Crying Game."

Fergus stands beneath her doorway, scribbles a note, and
sticks it in the letter box.EXT. CRICKET PITCH - DAYA man removes a large number six from a huge scoreboard with
a pole and replaces it with a number nine.

Below the scoreboard we can see Dil walking across a lawn
toward the building where Fergus is working.INT. SITE - DAYFergus, fitting a new window into the finished wall. On the
pitch we see the cricketers, distorted through the moving
glass of the window. Across the pitch Dil walks, with a lunch
basket in her hand, dressed in a very short skirt with high
heels. As she approaches the site a chorus of whistles breaks
out.

Fergus, hearing the whistling, stares out. He sees Dil moving
toward the site. He drops the window and the glass shatters.
As the whistles continue, we see Dil in the site's lift,
which rises up. We see Deveroux and Franknum climbing up a
ladder toward Fergus .DEVEROUXHow much did that frame cost, Mr.
          Franknum?FRANKNUMTwo hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.DEVEROUXYour Pat just cost me two hundred quid.FERGUSSorry.62.DEVEROUXSorry won't bring the bloody thing back,
          will it, Mr. Franknum?FRANKNUMNot in my experience.DEVEROUXOff his wages.FERGUSDo you mean that?DEVEROUXHe wants to know do I mean that.FRANKNUMI'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.DEVEROUXBloody right I do...

Through this conversation Fergus can hear the chorus of wolf
whistles increasing. He looks out the gap where the window
should be and sees Dil in the lift. The laborers whistle at
her, looking up her skirt, etc.

She passes by a gap in the wall and blows a kiss at him.DEVEROUXIs that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?FERGUSShe's not a tart.DEVEROUXNo, of course not, she's a lady.FERGUSShe's not that either.

Fergus walks out of the room.

Fergus walks round the scaffolding. Dil sees him and waves,
sits on some bricks and opens the hamper.DILDarling --

She is acting bright and businesslike, like any wife. She is
wearing dark glasses to cover the bruise on her face. She
pecks him on the cheek.63.DILNever let the sun go down on an argument,
          Jody used to say.FERGUSWhat you doing here?DILGot your note. So let's kiss and make up,
          hon.FERGUSDon't call me that.DILSorry, darling.FERGUSGive it over, Dil --DILApologies, my sweet.

Fergus smiles in spite of himself.DILThat's more like it, dear. Have a cuppa.

She takes out a thermos and pours him some tea.FERGUSYou're something else, Dil, you know
          that?DILNever said a truer word.

She hands him a neatly cut sandwich.DILSee, I was always best looking after
          someone. Must be something in the genes.FERGUSMust be.DILAnd the fact that you didn't know is
          basically the fault of yours truly. And
          even when you were throwing up, I could
          tell you cared.64.FERGUSYou could?DILDo you care, Jimmy?FERGUSSure I do.DILYou mean that?FERGUSYeah. I care, Dil.

She lowers her head.FERGUSYou crying, Dil?

He removes her glasses and looks at her moist eyes.DILI'm tired and emotional.

Then he hears a voice behind him.DEVEROUXDo it on your own time, Paddy.FERGUSWhat?DEVEROUXWhatever it is she does for you.

Fergus looks from Dil to Deveroux.FERGUSIf I was her I'd consider that an insult.DEVEROUXConsider it how you like. Just get that
          bloody tart out of here.

Fergus stands up suddenly. He speaks quietly.FERGUSDid you ever pick your teeth up with
          broken fingers?

Deveroux stares, suddenly chilled.65.DEVEROUXWhat's that supposed to mean?FERGUSIt's a simple question.

Deveroux says nothing. Fergus looks down to Dil.FERGUSCome on, dear.

He holds out his arm. Dil gathers up her things and takes it.
Her face is wreathed in a smile.DILHe didn't answer, honey --

Fergus walks her down the scaffolding ramp.FRANKNUMSorry about that, Mr. Deveroux.

Dil and Fergus descend from the site in the lift.DILMy, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.FERGUSShut up.DILMade me feel all funny inside.FERGUSI said stop it.DILAsk me to meet you again, Jimmy.FERGUSYou think that's wise?DILNothing's wise.

The lift stops with a thud.FERGUSI didn't mean to hit you.DILI know that.66.FERGUSKind of liked you as a girl.DILThat's a start.FERGUSSo I'm sorry.DILMake it up to me, then.FERGUSHow?DILAsk to meet me again.FERGUSWill you meet me again?DILWhen?FERGUSWhenever. Tonight.

She leans forward and kisses him. Fergus hears a wail of
catcalls behind him. He watches Dil go as the lift takes him
back up to the site.EXT. HAIR SALON - EVENING.Fergus, outside the hair salon. Dil, inside, is throwing off
her smock and walking toward him. All the girls are smiling.
Fergus looks from Dil to the girls as they approach.FERGUSDo they know?DILKnow what, honey?FERGUSKnow what I didn't know. And don't call
          me that.DILCan't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her
          feelings.FERGUSThing is, Dil, you're not a girl.67.DILDetails, baby, details.FERGUSSo they do know.DILAll right, they do.

She takes his arm as they walk off.FERGUSDon't.DILSorry.FERGUSI should have known, shouldn't I?DILProbably.FERGUSKind of wish I didn't.DILYou can always pretend.FERGUSThat's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't
          he?DILAbsolutely.FERGUSWon't be quite the same though, will it?DILAre you pretending yet?FERGUSI'm working on it.

Fergus hears a car following them, and turns around to look.FERGUSThere's Dave. He knew too.DILStop it, Jimmy.68.FERGUSAm I becoming repetitious?DILA little.FERGUSSorry.

They reach her door. The car stops.FERGUSDon't ask me in.DILPlease, Jimmy.FERGUSNo. Can't pretend that much.DILI miss you, Jimmy.FERGUSShould have stayed a girl.DILDon't be cruel.FERGUSOkay. Be a good girl and go inside.DILOnly if you kiss me.

Fergus kisses her. He looks at her open lips as if in
disbelief at himself.FERGUSHappy now?DILDelirious.

She goes inside.INT. HOSTEL - NIGHT.Fergus walks into the room and turns on a small desk-light.
Then he hears a voice.JUDEHello, stranger.69.He sees Jude sitting in the corner. Her hair is now dark
brown.JUDEYou vanished.

He stares at her, says nothing.JUDEWhat was it, Fergus? Did you blow the
          gaff on us or did you just fuck up?FERGUSLeave me alone, Jude.JUDENo. That's the last thing I'll do. You
          never asked what happened.FERGUSI heard.JUDEEddie and Tinker died.FERGUSI know.JUDEMaguire and me got out by the skin of our
          teeth. No thanks to you.... What you
          think of the hair?FERGUSSuits you.

She walks round the room.JUDEAye, I was sick of being blond. Needed a
          tougher look, if you know what I mean.

She lies down on the bed beside him, takes off a black
leather glove, and puts her hand on his crotch.JUDEFuck me, Fergus.

He takes her hand away.JUDEAm I to take it that's a no?70.He says nothing.JUDEWe had a court-martial in your absence.
          They wanted to put a bullet in your head.
          I pleaded for clemency. Said we should
          find out what happened first. So what did
          happen?FERGUSHe ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back.
          I tried to catch him. He made it to the
          road and got hit by a Saracen.JUDESo you did fuck up.FERGUSYes.JUDEBut you know what the thing is, Fergus?FERGUSNo, what is the thing?JUDEYou vanished quite effectively. Became
          Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how
          useful that could be.FERGUSWhat do you mean?JUDEWe've got some plans here. And we'll need
          a Mister Nobody to execute them.FERGUSNo way, Jude. I'm out.JUDEYou're never out, Fergus.

She looks at him hard. He looks away.JUDEMaybe you don't care whether you die or
          not. But consider the girl, Fergus. The
          wee black chick.

He leaps up from the bed.71.FERGUSLeave her out of this.JUDEJesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche.
          You know we won't leave her out of this.
          But I'm glad to see you care.

She brings her lips close to his so they touch.JUDEAnd I must admit I'm curious.

He grabs her hair and pulls her head back.FERGUSWhat the fuck do you know, Jude?

She pulls a gun and sticks it between his teeth.JUDEYou fucking tell me, boy --

Fergus stares at her. Then says quietly:FERGUSShe's nobody. She likes me.JUDESo I suppose a fuck is out of the
          question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No
          sudden moves. And not a whisper to her.
          You'll be hearing from us.

She kisses him briefly, with the gun at his temple.JUDEKeep the faith.

She goes. Fergus stands in the darkness.EXT. HAIR SALON - EVENING.Fergus, walking toward the hair salon, flowers in his hand.

He stands outside watching, the flowers behind his back. Then
the chair turns and we see it is Jude.

Fergus freezes. He sees Jude looking at him, smiling
brightly, then talking back to Dil72.INT. HAIR SALON - EVENING.JUDEHe your boyfriend?

Jude, turning in the chair.JUDELucky you.INT. INDIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT.DILCarnations.FERGUSWhat?DILHe'd bring me carnations.FERGUSSo I got it wrong, then.DILNot at all, honey.FERGUSDon't.DILOkay.

She smiles brightly at something behind Fergus. He turns and
sees Jude is there. Fergus stands, suddenly.

He throws some money on the table, grabs her arm, and frog-
marches her out.FERGUSCome on.DILWhy, honey --FERGUSCome on.DILYou gonna tell me why?FERGUSNo.73.As they pass Jude, she smiles.EXT. INDIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT.Outside the restaurant. Fergus marches Dil away.DILWhat's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong--FERGUSNot here.

They pass out of shot. In the background we see Jude rising.INT. METRO - NIGHT.Dil and Fergus making their way to their seats at the bar.DILYou gonna tell me what it is?

A figure sitting down at the bar. It is Jude.JUDEWhat was it?DILYou know her, Jimmy?JUDEJimmy, is it? Do you know me, Jimmy?FERGUSDil, this is Jude.DILYou following me?JUDEYeah. Just checking. He being nice to

          Jimmy?DILA girl has to have a bit of glamour.JUDEAbsolutely. Long as she can keep it.
          Isn't that right, James...

She leaves. Dil watches her go.DILIt's her, isn't it?FERGUSWhat's her?DILShe's the thing you had to tell me.FERGUSKind of.DILI'm sorry, you know that? I'm really
          sorry.

She looks at ColDILYou see that, Col?COLSaw it, Dil.DILFuck it, is what I say.COLYeah. Fuck it, Dil.DILFucking men, Col --75.COLFuck 'em.

There are tears in her eyes. She stands.DILAnd fuck you, Jimmy --

She staggers out of the pub. Fergus sits there. There is an
expression in Col's eyes that makes Fergus feel very, very
small.COLYou could always make it up to her.FERGUSHow?COLWhen a girl runs out like that, she
          generally wants to be followed.FERGUSShe's not a girl, Col --COLWhatever you say.

But Fergus rises and walks out.EXT. METRO - NIGHT.A figure standing down the alleyway, smoking. Fergus looks
toward it, but Jude is standing there, waiting.JUDEShe went that way --

Jude grabs his arm.JUDEBut you come with me.

She draws him down an alley where the same car is waiting.
They get inside.ANOTHER CAR - BY THE PUB.Dil, sitting inside a taxi watching Fergus and Jude getting
in the car.76.INT. CAR - NIGHT.In the moving car. Jude is driving, Maguire next to her.
Fergus sits in the back.FERGUSSo it was you all the time.MAGUIREWho'd you think it was?FERGUSI thought it was Dave.MAGUIREAnd who's Dave when he's at home?FERGUSHe's at home.MAGUIREShould blow you away, you know that?FERGUSI know that.

Maguire stubs his cigarette out on Fergus's hand, then whacks
him on the teeth with his closed fist.MAGUIREI'm getting emotional. And I don't want
          to get fucking emotional -- you
          understand, Hennessy?FERGUSI understand.MAGUIREFuck you, too --

Jude drives. Fergus looks through the back window at the
street outside.JUDELeave him alone, Peter. He's in love.MAGUIREThat true, Fergus? You in love?FERGUSAbsolutely.77.MAGUIREAnd what's she like between the sheets?FERGUSDefinitely unusual.MAGUIREAnd who is she?FERGUSJust a girl.MAGUIREAnd you know what'll happen if you fuck

down is the entrance to what looks like a sedate conservative
club.

In the car, Maguire turns off the engine. He nods toward the
building.MAGUIRESo what do you think that is, Hennessy?FERGUSA hotel?MAGUIREIt's a knocking-shop. Tres discreet, huh?
             He visits his ladies on Tuesday and
             Thursday nights and Saturday mornings.
             His security's in the car beyond.

He nods toward a car, a Daimler, parked some distance away.
Fergus looks from the window to the car.FERGUSWho is he?MAGUIREDoesn't matter who he is. He is what we
             would call a legitimate target.78.FERGUSThank God for that.MAGUIREYou being cynical, Hennessy?FERGUSHope not.MAGUIREGood. So what do you think?FERGUSWhoever hits him'll be hit, if those men
          are any good. And I presume you can't get
          in.MAGUIRERight.FERGUSSo it's on the street.MAGUIRERight.FERGUSKind of suicide, isn't it?

Jude turns around to look at him.FERGUSBut, then, I don't have a choice.JUDEOch, you do, Fergie.FERGUSOf course. I forgot.JUDECome on, Fergie. A rehearsal.

Jude and Fergus get out of the car. They walk down the
street, down from the brothel-cum-club, where there is a cafe-
bar with some tables outside.EXT. REGENCY SQUARE - NIGHT.Fergus and Jude, crossing the street.JUDEYou keep your mind on the job, boy --79.FERGUSAnd then you'll leave her out of it?JUDEAye. Then we'll leave her be.

They take their seats by the tables. We can see the brothel
down the way.JUDEHe's arthritic. Takes him two minutes to
          get to the door.

She checks her watch. Fergus is sweating.FERGUSAnd what if I say no?JUDEYou know what. Go.

Down by the brothel, the door swings open.

Fergus walks like any pedestrian down toward the brothel.
There is an old, portly gent in a City suit emerging from it.
The car by the pavement kicks into action and the door opens.

Fergus quickens his pace.

Jude, by the cafe, watches. Fergus, walking.

The gent makes his way, with gout-ridden slowness, across the
pavement, through the passersby, toward the car.

A burly security man emerging from the car, walking toward
the old gent.

Fergus reaches the car just before he does, and passes
between him and the open door. The old gent's stomach brushes
Fergus's elbow.GENTPardon me, young man --

Fergus walks on.

Jude, from the cafe, watches -- Fergus walking on, the old
man being eased with painstaking care inside the Daimler.
Then the door closing and the Daimler pulling off.

When the Daimler has passed Fergus, he turns around and walks
back.80.Jude smiles and leaps up as he approaches.JUDEYou were made for this.FERGUSWas I?JUDEPerfect.FERGUSAnd what happens then?JUDEWe'll be on the other side. We'll move
          when you do.FERGUSAnd what if you don't?JUDEFergus, I think you don't trust me.FERGUSYou may be right.JUDEStay late at your work tomorrow night and
          I'll bring you the gear.

Jude begins to walk away.FERGUSJude?JUDEYes?FERGUSWho's the old geezer?JUDESome judge...

She walks off, crosses the road to Maguire, in the car.
Fergus turns around to see Dil in front of the cafe. She goes
inside; he follows.FERGUSWhy'd you follow me, Dil?81.DILWas jealous, Jimmy.

She downs a drink and motions for another. She seems high.FERGUSShouldn't be, DilDILWhy shouldn't I be jealous?

There are tears streaming down her face. He takes his hand
and begins to wipe her face.DILDon't. My makeup.

She sits down; he joins her.DILShe own you, Jimmy?FERGUSYes.DILShe from Scotland too?FERGUSYou could say that.DILAnd you're not going to tell me more?FERGUSI can't.

He wipes the tears from her face with a tissue then dabs the
tissue in her drink and wipes some more.DILWhat you doing, Jimmy?FERGUSI'm not sure.DILDo you like me even a little bit?FERGUSMore than that.

Dil's face, staring at him.82.FERGUSCome on, let's go for a walk.

She allows herself to be led out.EXT. HAIR SALON - NIGHT.Dil and Fergus walking. Fergus stops her by the window.FERGUSYou do something for me, Dil?DILAnything.FERGUSYou'd do anything for me?DILAfraid so.FERGUSYou got the keys to the shop?

He sits her down in one of the chairs.FERGUSYou'd do anything for me?

Dil nods.DILAnything.

Fergus takes up a scissors to snip at her hair. Her head
leaps back.DILNo way --83.FERGUSYou said anything, DilDILA girl has to draw the line somewhere --FERGUSWant to change you to a man, Dil...

She stares at him.DILWhy?FERGUSIt's a secret.DILYou'd like me better that way, Jimmy?FERGUSYes.DILAnd you wouldn't leave me?FERGUSNo.DILYou promise?FERGUSI promise.

She takes a breath.DILGo on, then.

Fergus begins to cut.

CLOSE-UP ON DlL'S FACE as her hair is shorn. Tears stream
down her cheeks.DILYou're no good at this, Jimmy.FERGUSI'm sorry.

But he keeps cutting. He gives Dil a short, cropped military
cut like Jody's.84.DILYou want to make me look like him...FERGUSNo. Want to make you into something new.
          That nobody recognizes...

She looks in the mirror at it in the dark.DILDon't recognize myself, Jimmy.INT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT.Dil enters, with her new haircut. She goes to turn on the
light. He stops her hand.FERGUSNo.

She looks at her hand on his.FERGUSBetter in the dark.

Her fingers close around his.DILSo it's true, then?FERGUSWhat?DILYou like me better like this.FERGUSYes.

She brings her lips to his neck. He lets them stay there. His
hands travel up to her blouse. He begins to undo the buttons.DILOh, Jimmy --

Slowly the blouse slips down, exposing her male torso. She
falls down to her knees and tugs at his belt.FERGUSNo. No. Dil... get up...

He raises her to her feet and leads her toward the bed. She
stretches languorously down on it.85.He unzips her skirt slowly, and draws it off. She turns on
the bed sexily, her face to the mattress. She is wearing
suspender-belts underneath her skirt.DILBaby...

But Fergus stands and walks quietly over to the wardrobe
where the soldier's things are. Dil on the bed, slowly turns.DILWhat are you doing, honey...

We see Fergus from her point of view, coming toward her with
Jody's white cricket shirt, glowing eerily in the dark.FERGUSDon't call me that --DILSorry. What you doing?

Fergus draws her slowly up to a standing position.FERGUSTry this on, Dil

He wraps the shirt around her.DILWhy?FERGUSFor me.DILFor you...

She kisses him.EXT. SMALL HOTEL - NIGHT.Fergus leading Dil, dressed in Jody's cricket clothes, down
the street and inside.DILWhy are we going here, Jimmy?FERGUSLook on it like a honeymoon.86.INT. SMALL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT.From above, we see the figures of Fergus and Dil, sleeping on
a double bed, both fully clothed. Fergus smokes, then puts
out the cigarette.

Time lapse. The light gradually fills the room. Fergus wakes.
Looks at the bedside clock, and very gingerly rises, puts on
his coat, and walks out.EXT. SITE - EVENING.A car pulls up at the site. Jude gets out. She has a satchel
in her hand.INT. SITE - EVENING.Fergus looking down a ladder-staircase at Jude.JUDEYou a handyman, Fergie?FERGUSI take pride in my work.JUDEI sincerely hope so.

Fergus climbs down a ladder to Jude; she hands him something
from the bag.JUDETools of the trade.

She kisses him. Fergus looks at her expressionlessly.JUDEAnd forget about the girl.

Fergus opens what Jude has given him -- looking inside. There
is a gun wrapped in an oilcloth.INT. SMALL HOTEL - NIGHT.Fergus enters. The room is empty. He calls.FERGUSDil?

No reply. He runs outside.87.EXT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT.Fergus looks up at her building, but the lights are off in
her flat. The sound of feet behind him. He turns and sees Dil
walking toward him, a bottle in her hand. He runs toward her.FERGUSDil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing
          here?DILI'm going home!FERGUSTold you to stay in the hotel!DILThought you was fooling me. Thought you
          was leaving me.

They are tussling in the darkness of the park. She is very
drunk.FERGUSI had to go to work!DILStayed all day in that room thinking
          every noise was you. There's something
          you're not telling me, Jimmy.

He takes her arm.FERGUSCome on...DILNo! I'm going home...

Fergus and Dil, on the stairs up to Dil's flat.DILSo tell me.FERGUSI was trying to get out of something.DILNo! Tell me everything, Jimmy.

Fergus looks at her.88.FERGUSYou got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.DILYou mean that?FERGUSYes.

And she suddenly faints into his arms. As if on cue.FERGUSStop it, would you?

There is no response. He shakes her.FERGUSGive it over, Dil, for fuck's sake --

Still no response. He grows alarmed. He slaps her cheek. She
opens her eyes slowly.DILSorry. I get nervous. I got this blood
             condition. Just help me inside, Jimmy,
             then I'll be all right.INT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT.He walks in holding her. Leans her against the wall, then
goes to the window to check the street outside.

She takes a large slug from a bottle of whiskey.FERGUSYou heard what I said, Dil?DILMy pills...

She points weakly to a cabinet through the open door of the
bathroom.FERGUSWhat pills?DILPrescription. For my condition.FERGUSWhat condition?89.DILMy condition. Ennui.

He goes and gets the pills.

She takes a handful of pills. She drinks from the whiskey
bottle.FERGUSAre you supposed to take that many?DILOnly in times of extreme stress.

She walks around the room, drinking, then sits down.DILSee, they all say good-bye sometime.
           'Cept for him.

She looks at the picture of Jody. Then she looks at Fergus.FERGUSAre you all right, Dil?DILI will be.

She stares straight ahead, the bottle clutched in her hands
between her knees.DILGo on, then.

Fergus walks slowly toward the door.FERGUSGood-bye, DilDILJimmy?FERGUSWhat?DILDon't go like that.

She looks at him, standing up. Something incredibly
attractive about her.DILCan't help what I am.90.He walks slowly toward her. He kisses her, on the lips.

We see the photograph with the soldier's smiling face. Fergus
looks from it to her. She seems to be in a sweet narcotic
haze. She reaches out her hand and strokes his.DILKnew you had a heart...

Fergus sits down on the bed. Dil is lying back on it.FERGUSDil Can I tell you something? I knew your
          man.DILYou knew which man?FERGUSYour soldier.DILYou knew my Jody?

She still strokes his hand. Her voice is dreamily slurred,
her eyes far away.FERGUSLifted him from a carnival in Belfast.
          Held him hostage for three days.DILYou knew my Jody?FERGUSAre you listening?

Dil smiles woozily.DILYes.FERGUSI got the order to shoot him. Before I
          could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and
          died.DILDied...FERGUSDid you hear me?91.DILYou killed my Jody?FERGUSIn a manner of speaking.DILIt was you...

She is not rational. She is smiling, far away somewhere.FERGUSYou should scream. You should beat my
          head off.

She woozily tries to hit him round the face.DILYou killed my JodyFERGUSNo.DILYou didn't.FERGUSI suppose I tried.DILYou tried.FERGUSDon't you want to kill me?

Dil raises an unsteady hand and points it at him.DILBang...

He strokes her cheek. She says very slowly and sleepilyDILDon't leave me tonight. Might kill me,
          too.FERGUSOkay.

Her eyes close. She falls into a deep sleep. Fergus looks
down at her, almost fondly.92.INT. DIL'S FLAT - MORNING.They are lying on the bed together, fully clothed. Dil wakes.
She rises very quietly and goes to his coat, thrown across a
chair. She searches through the pockets and takes out the
gun.INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING.Jude in bed. An alarm sounds; she reaches to turn it off.INT. DIL'S FLAT.Dil takes several silk stockings out of a drawer and ties
them very securely to each corner of the brass bed. She ties
them round both of Fergus's feet, very gently, so as not to
wake him.INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING.Jude, in front of a mirror, getting ready.INT. DIL'S FLAT.She draws one of Fergus's hands up, very gingerly, and ties
that securely to the upright. She ties the other and is
drawing it upward when he wakes. She jerks the silk stocking
so it is secure.FERGUSWhat the fuck --

Dil speaks unnaturally quietly.DILSo tell me what you're doing, Jimmy.INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING.Jude, fully dressed. She takes a gun from under the bed and
slips it in her handbag.INT. DIL'S FLAT - MORNING.Dil crouching beside Fergus, his gun in her hand.DILDidn't really listen last night. I heard
             but I didn't listen.

Fergus, staring at her. He tries to pull on the bindings.93.DILThat won't do you no good. Dil knows how
          to tie a body.

She stands up, still pointing the gun at Fergus.DILWondered why you came on to me like that
          when you gave me the look.FERGUSHe asked me to see were you all right.EXT. STREET - DAYJude on the street. Maguire's car pulls up rapidly and she

          touched. Be nice to her and she'll be
          yours forever.

She looks at him, tears in her eyes.DILSee, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I
          can't do that. Yet.FERGUSLet me go, Dil

He drags at his bindings.DILWhy?FERGUSGot to be somewhere.DILTry and go, then.94.EXT. STREET BY BROTHEL - DAYThe figure of the judge in the window. Outline of a woman.
Jude and Maguire are in the car, parked across the street.

          they'll be hereDILLet them come then.IN THE CAR. OUTSIDE BROTHEL.JUDECan't stay here, Peter -- drive around

          longer...EXT. STREET BY BROTHEL - DAYMaguire's car driving round once more. No sign of Fergus.MAGUIREThat fucker's dead --JUDENo, we are.INT. DIL'S FLAT.Fergus strains and roars from the bed.FERGUSYou don't know what you're doing, Dil --95.DILNever did...

MAGUIRE'S POINT OF VIEW -- the brothel door opening. The
elderly judge comes out. The car with his security men guns
up.MAGUIREGive me the shooter, Jude --JUDEYou're crazy --MAGUIREGive me the fucking shooter!

He grabs it from her pocket. Throws open the door and runs
across the street. Jude dives into the driver's seat.INT. DIL'S FLAT.Fergus, pulling at his bindings.EXT. OUTSIDE THE BROTHEL.The judge walking toward the open door of the car, held open
by his goon. Maguire, running toward him, gun in hand. The
goon sees him. Maguire shoots as he runs. Once, twice, three
times, four. The judge falls. The goon, hit in the arm, pulls
an Uzi and returns fire. Maguire hit, still shooting. Other
goons tear from the car. Mayhem, screaming. Jude hits the
pedal on her car and screeches off. Maguire, dead.INT. DIL'S FLAT - DAYDil dressed in the soldier's cricket clothes. She looks like
a sweet little boy. She places a cassette in the tape deck --
"The Crying Game" song. She comes to the bed, and points the
gun at Fergus's head.DILYou like me now, Jimmy?FERGUSI like you, Dil --DILGive me a bit more, baby, a bit more.FERGUSMore what?96.DILMore endearments.FERGUSI like you, DIlDILLove me.FERGUSYes.DILTell me you love me.FERGUSWhatever you say, Dil.DILThen say it.FERGUSLove you, Dil.DILYou do?FERGUSYeah.DILWhat would you do for me?FERGUSAnything.

She begins to cry and lays the gun gently on his chest.DILSay it again.FERGUSI'd do anything for you, Dil.

She pulls on his bindings to release him.EXT. STREET.Two police cars, sirens wailing.97.INT. DIL'S FLAT.Dil's face, close to Fergus's, as the stockings that bound
his hands are nearly undone.DILAnd you'll never leave me?FERGUSNever.DILI know you're lying, Jimmy, but it's nice
          to hear it.

His arm is free. He strokes her hair.FERGUSI'm sorry, Dil.

She shudders with weeping. The music of the song plays in the
background.

Jude walking through the open door, arms extended, holding a
gun.JUDEYou stupid shit -- Once was bad enough.
          But twice.

Dil rises from the bed and points her gun at Jude.DILYou didn't knock, honey --

Dil fires, hits Jude. Jude falls and is writhing on the
floor.FERGUSDil!JUDEGet that thing off me, Fergus --

Dil walks closer, holding the gun and pointing it at Jude.DILWhat was that she called you, Jimmy?FERGUSFergus.98.DILWhat's Fergus?FERGUSIt's my name, Dil --DILWhat happened to Jimmy?JUDEI said get it off me, Fergus --

Jude, on the floor, reaches for her gun. Manages to grab it.DILWhat's she going to do, Jimmy? She going
          to blow you away?

Dil shoots again, like a child, playing with a toy. She hits
Jude in her gun shoulder. Jude spins one way, the gun the
other.DILWas she there too? When you got my Jody?

Fergus screamsFERGUSDil!!!DILI asked you a question, honey -- were you
          there too --JUDEYou sick bitch --

As she raises the gun, Dil shoots her repeatedly, saying:DILYou was there, wasn't you? You used those
          tits and that ass to get him, didn't you?

Fergus screams from the bed. He rips free his other arm. Dil
shoots Jude in the throat, and she falls dead, covered in
blood. Dil turns the gun on Fergus.DILShe was there, wasn't she?99.FERGUSShe was --DILAnd she used her tits and that cute
          little ass to get him, didn't she?FERGUSYes.DILTell me what she wore.FERGUSCan't remember...

Dil points the gun at him, squeezing on the trigger. Then she
stops.DILCan't do it, Jimmy. He won't let me.

She looks at the picture; walks over and sits down in front
of it.DILYou won't let me, Jody --

She raises the gun and places it in her mouth. Fergus takes
it gently from her mouth and places it on the table. He lifts
her up by the shoulders.FERGUSYou've got to go now, Dil --DILDo I?FERGUSYes. Now.DILAm I in trouble, Jimmy?FERGUSNot if you go.DILWill I see you again?FERGUSYou will, Dil100.DILPromise?FERGUSI promise.DILWhere am I to go, Jimmy?FERGUSThe Metro.DILMeet Col --FERGUSYes. Say hello to Col --

He leads her out the door. Fergus goes back into the room,
past Jude's body. Looks out the window to where he can see
Dil staggering down the street, through the crowds that have
gathered. The wail of police sirens coming closer. He watches
Dil run off, with her funny walk. Then looks down and sees
the cop cars pushing through the knot of people around the
house. He picks up the gun, wipes it with a rag to remove
Dil's fingerprints. He turns to the picture of the soldier;
talks to it.FERGUSYou should have stayed at home.

He sits in the chair by the window, waiting.FADE TO BLACK.INT. PRISON VISITING ROOM - DAYFADE UP to reveal a large interior, with light streaming in
the windows. Large barred doors open and a group of women
come through, with parcels, children in tow, etc. Among them
is Dil, looking resplendent. She walks past the rows of
convicts with their families, up to a glass cage, where
Fergus sits, waiting.DILGot you the multivitamins and the iron
          tablets, hon --FERGUSDon't call me that --101.DILSorry, love. Now, the white ones are
          magnesium supplement --FERGUSStop it, Dil --DILI've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm
          counting the days. Two thousand three
          hundred and thirty-four left.FERGUSThirty-five.DILI'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the
          leap year. What am I supposed to call you
          then, Jimmy?FERGUSFergus.DILFergus. Fergus my love, light of my life --FERGUSPlease, Dil --DILCan't help it. You're doing time for me.
          No greater love, as the man says. Wish
          you'd tell me why.FERGUSAs the man said, it's in my nature.DILWhat's that supposed to mean?

She shakes her head.FERGUSWell, there was this scorpion, you see.
          And he wants to go across the river. But
          he can't swim. So he goes to this frog,
          who can swim, and he says to him, "Excuse
          me, Mr. Froggy..."102.CAMERA PULLS BACK, and as Fergus tells the story of the
scorpion and the frog, the music comes up -- "Stand By Your
Man."FADE OUT.
