	When he turns we get our first view of DR. RICHARD KIMBLE, 
	a tall, athletic man, with a trim beard.

	He moves from the outer lobby into a fabulously decorated 
	ballroom where a fashion show is taking place as a medical
	fundraiser. Doctors and their spouses, hospital brass and 
	sponsors mingle. Women sit near the runway watching the 
	models. Men talk by the bar. The room is packed.

	A banner over the rostrum says: "CHILDREN'S RESEARCH ANDAID FOUNDATION"Kimble is handed a glass of champagne, which he promptly 
	sets on another waiter's passing tray.ROBERTS (V.O.)Richard...

		wanted to meet you...

	Just then Kimble spots an attractive WOMAN, late thirties, 
	wearing a drop-dead, simple black gown. She's surrounded by

	catch a look and hold it.NICHOLS (V.O.)Richard Kimble... Alex Lentz. Alex

	her with the details of their boring studies as CREDITSCONTINUE...INTERCUTTING WITH the fashion, catches of dialog and course 
	changes, Kimble and Helen demonstrate an oft-used exchange 
	of glances: Kimble, while gracious to his dinner partners, 
	catches Helen's eye and makes smiling, subtle movements to 
	his watch or a look to the door to indicate he's clearly 
	ready to leave. On the receiving end, Helen, the gatekeeper 
	of their social propriety, indicates with equal subtlety: 
	"not yet."

	As we MOVE AROUND the table we hear:

	"Where's your husband on staff?" "My husband's an orthopod 
	at Northwestern." "I'm working on a new technique..." 
	"That's fascinating..." "That's quite a marvelous dress 
	you're wearing." "Do you like it? My husband says it's a 
	'four-fracture number."' "Honey." (A look from her husband.)

	Kimble shares a look with Helen. He subtly motions to his 
	watch: time go to, and mouths the word: "now." She shakes 
	her head.NOW EAU WIFE(to table)
		I told my husband that he was going

	a look. Helen mouths the word: "Now."HELEN(to her dinner partners)
		I'm sorry, I have to get my husband

	he enters he sees a large form in the crack behind the door. 
	Adrenal surge.

	Kimble slams the door back on the figure knocking the gun 
	free. Before Kimble can move to it a forearm flattens him. 
	The attacker immediately goes for the gun. Kimble grabs a 
	leg and twists him down, the man's fingers hit the gun, 
	sending it skittering across the hardwood floor of the 
	landing and over the edge - three flights to the entry 
	hall below.

	SIRENS can be heard. Distant but APPROACHING.

	The man kicks free and tries to flee. This time Kimble 
	catches an arm and twists it at an unnatural angle. To his
	shock, the limb detaches between the shoulder and elbow.

	The train burrows to a stop.

	Kimble is suddenly five feet taller, standing on an upheaval

	about to happen.ANGLE - OLD GUARDSeated near a tree. A space blanket draped over his

	He slaps the file of fax-photos at Gerard on his way out. 
	Just as Biggs, spotless, eases ino the group with Kimble's 
	manacles. Behind Biggs we see Newman, covered in mud.

	Seeing the leg irons, the Sheriff and his deputies pile to
	a stop. Now Gerard takes his run at Old Guard.GERARDPlease, ladies and gentlemen, step

	Like an obedient dog the press backs off, they sense a
