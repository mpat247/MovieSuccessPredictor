                               Will Reiser7/2/08FADE IN:OPENING TITLE SEQUENCEEXT. SAN DIEGO - DAYIt's another picture perfect day in San Diego. The beaches,
          golf courses, and yacht clubs are packed with hundreds of
          rapturous citizens.EXT. BUS STOP - DAYA BUS pulls up and unloads it's passengers.
                         
          We follow ADAM SCHWARTZ(25), a kind faced, mild mannered,
          pragmatist - who despite his youth has the cynicism of an old
          man. He steps off the bus, crosses the street and approachesMOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL.INT. MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL - DAYAdam enters the Hospital. The mood is calm. All the chaos one
          would expect to find in a hospital of this size is tucked
          away behind the sterile and monochrome walls.
                         
          Adam walks to the reception counter. The RECEPTIONIST is
          engrossed with the latest edition of US Weekly. She ignores
          Adam who just stands there awkwardly, unsure of what to do.
                         
          Adam gives out a small cough to grab her attention. The
          Receptionist keeps her eyes fixed on her magazine.RECEPTIONISTCan I help you?ADAMI have an appointment.RECEPTIONISTName?ADAMAdam Schwartz.
                         
          The Receptionist says nothing. Adam stands silent, not
          knowing what to do. He coughs again.
                         
          Annoyed, the Receptionist looks up but says nothing.2.ADAM (CONT'D)(CONFUSED)Um, am I supposed to go somewhere?
                         
          With her eyes the Receptionist points to the waiting area.ADAM (CONT'D)Oh, should I go sit?
                         
          The Receptionist rolls her eyes and returns to her magazine.
                         
          Adam looks around the empty waiting room. He takes a seat and
          browses through a dozen outdated magazines: Highlights, Time,
          Life, Modern Maternity, etc. Only moments later, as though he
          hadn't just introduced himself, the Receptionist calls out:RECEPTIONISTAdam Schwartz.
                         
          Adam looks around the waiting room. There's no one else
          there. Again the receptionist calls out again -RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)Adam Schwartz.ADAMYeah, that's me.RECEPTIONISTFollow me.
                         
          The Receptionist leads Adam to a small changing room and
          hands him a hospital gown.RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)Put this on.ADAMDo I need to take off all my
           clothes?
                         
          The Receptionist stares blankly at Adam.ADAM (CONT'D)I'll figure it out.
                         
          The Receptionist leaves. Adam awkwardly undresses and slips
          on the hospital gown. Unsure which end of the gown is the
          front, Adam adjusts the garment a few times until he decides
          he has it right.
                         
          Adam pulls back the curtain of the changing room to find
          JOANNE, an overly cheery nurse.3.NURSE JOANNEHi Adam, my name is Joanne, so nice
           to meet you.
                         
          Adam scratches his chest, the hospital gown is beginning to
          irritate his skin.ADAMYou don't happen to have anything
           in a cotton blend?NURSE JOANNE(LAUGHS)Cotton. You're funny.
                         
          Joanne hands Adam a giant specimen cup marked with a thick
          yellow line.NURSE JOANNE (CONT'D)Now I'm going to need you to fill
           this cup with urine. You think you
           can do that?ADAMYou want me to fill this entire
           cup.JOANNEYup.
                         
          Adam looks down at the cup in total disbelief.ADAMIt's gonna take me at least a week
           to fill this. Can I take it home?JOANNE(LAUGHS)Take it home. You're so funny.
                         
          The CAMERA PANS to reveal a group of MEDICAL STUDENTS taking
          diligent notes in the background. WE PAN AGAIN this time to
          the next room:INT. HOSPITAL. BATHROOMAdam struggles to fill the cup. After a few beats, there's a
          knock on the door.JOANNE (O.S.)You okay in there Adam?4.ADAMJust another minute.
                         
          Adam looks down at the empty cup in frustration. The CAMERA
          PANS to the next room:INT. HOSPITAL. X-RAY ROOMAdam stands in front of an X-Ray machine. The APATHETIC
          TECHNICIAN has him stand in a dozen uncomfortable positions
          for long periods of time: sideways, one arm in the air, then
          the other arm, on one leg, then the other, one leg in the
          air, then the other, and so on.
                         
          Again we see the group of Medical Students taking notes. The
          CAMERA PANS to the next room:INT. HOSPITAL. EXAMINING ROOMJoanne pulls out a giant needle.JOANNEHere comes the choo-choo!
                         
          In the back we see the Med Students still taking notes. The
          CAMERA PANS to the next room:INT. HOSPITAL. MRI ROOMAdam is lying on the gurney of an MRI machine. He is slowly
          drawn into the enclosed body scanner.TECHNICIAN(AUTHORITATIVELY)Now make sure you lie completely
           still. Otherwise we'll have to do
           it all over again. Which we're not
           going to have to do, right?INT. HOSPITAL. MRI ROOM - LATERAdam lies perfectly still in the enclosed body scanner.ADAMHello? Is anybody out there?
                         
          There's no one there. He's been left unattended. The MRI
          Technician is watching the Laker game in the next room.5.ADAM (CONT'D)I have to pee.
                         
          The Med Students continue to take notes.END OPENING TITLE SEQUENCEEXT. SAN DIEGO - EVENINGThrough the window of the hospital the CAMERA PULLS OUT and
          PANS across the San Diego skyline. We watch as the Sun sets
          to night, then rises to morning...EXT. SAN DIEGO BEACH - MORNINGSUPER: JUNEIt's a gray morning as the thick spring fog slowly begins to
          lift. With no one in sight, the only sound that can be heard
          is that of the waves crashing onto the shoreline and then
          rolling back out to the Pacific Ocean.
                         
          About a mile inland, we come upon:EXT. GRAND VIEW GATED COMMUNITY - DAYRows of identical two and three bedroom town houses with
          lawns groomed to perfection fill the community. This is
          Southern California Suburbia.
                         
          The sound of the waves crashing gets increasingly louder and
          louder as we PUSH IN ON:INT. ADAM'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUSThe interior of Adam's house is spotless. Pictures on the
          walls: Adam and his dad sailing. Adam and his parents at his
          Bar Mitzvah. Adam and his best friend, Seth, at High School
          Graduation. A University of Berkeley hat. A National Academic
          Achievement Award in the Sciences.
                         
          Curled in a fetal position, Adam sleeps peacefully next to
          RACHEL (25), his loving girlfriend. Cute, charming, and
          artsy, Rachel is "Winnie Cooper" all grown up.
                         
          The sound of the waves crashing stops abruptly. A loud
          obnoxious alarm clock goes off. Startled, Adam jumps up.
          Drenched in sweat, and completely disoriented, he looks
          around in confusion.6.After a moment, Adam pulls an earplug out of each ear, and
          turns off the alarm. The sound of the crashing waves turns
          back on. Adam pushes a button on the alarm clock and the
          sound of the waves stops, but the loud obnoxious alarm
          returns. He pushes the clock again. The alarm turns off but
          now we hear the sound of crickets chirping. Again Adam pushes
          a button, this time we hear the sound of a loud thunder/rain
          storm, he pushes a button again, this time we hear the sound
          of loud clanging church bells. Rachel rolls over -RACHEL(asleep and incoherent)
           Make it stop.ADAM(WHISPERS)It won't turn off.
                         
          Frustrated, Adam tries pushing all the buttons. This only
          makes it worse. We hear ALL of the previous sounds
          simultaneously sound off. Rachel rolls over and moans as she
          puts a pillow over her head.ADAM (CONT'D)(WHISPERS)Sorry.
                         
          Adam reaches down and unplugs the alarm clock, bringing an
          end to the noise. He sits for a moment at the edge of the
          bed, collects himself.
                         
          Adam looks down at Rachel and begins kissing her neck.RACHELMmmmm.
                         
          Rachel gently strokes her fingers through Adam's hair.
          Something catches her attention - a single strand of hair.
          She holds it up.RACHEL (CONT'D)Oh my god.ADAMWhat?RACHELI think you have a gray hair.ADAMReally?RACHELI'm gonna pull it out.7.ADAMNo! Don't touch it.
                         
          Adam jumps from bed. He rushes into the bathroom. Rachel
          rolls back to sleep.INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUSAdam stands in front of the mirror and searches for the gray
          hair. Once he finds it, he holds it out for a closer look. It
          is in fact a gray hair. He smiles.INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATERAs Adam showers, he tries to squirt shampoo into his hand,
          but the bottle is empty. He looks over at Rachel's large
          assortment of shower products, finds one that smells
          pleasant, Fructis by L'Oreal, and squirts some into his hair.
          He then proceeds to lather his entire body in the product.INT. BEDROOM CLOSET - MOMENTS LATERAdam dresses in front of the bathroom mirror. His outfit is
          well put together, but not what you would expect of someone
          his age - more of a Mr. Rogers look. He pulls out a LINT
          BRUSH and meticulously combs his cardigan.EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - LATERSETH (25), pulls up in front of Adam's house in his white
          Neon and HONKS the horn. On the bumper is a sticker: "Let's
          put the Christ back in Christmas."
                         
          Overweight, well dressed, and wearing an air of confidence,
          Seth pulls out a massive joint, lights it and takes a hit.
                         
          Just then Seth looks over at 3 YOUNG SCHOOL CHILDREN and
          their MOTHER waiting for the school bus. The mother's jaw is
          on the ground in shock. Seth hides the joint and smiles in
          embarrassment.SETHHi kids. Beautiful day isn't it?
                         
          The mother quickly moves her kids out of sight.
                         
          Adam approaches Seth's car. He spots his neighbors ANDREW and
          MISSY DONNELLY (late 40's) getting into their car. They wave
          to Adam.8.ANDREWHey Adam.ADAM(SEEMS ANNOYED)Hey Andrew.ANDREWSorry about the noise last night.
                         
          Adam shrugs as if to say "what the fuck?" Andrew and Missy
          giggle as they get into their car.INT. SETH'S CAR - CONTINUOUSAdam gets into the car.SETHYo.ADAMYo.SETH...What's that smell?(SNIFFS ADAM)Are you wearing perfume?ADAMNo.SETHWell, you smell like the cast of
           Steel Magnolias.ADAM(SMELLS HIMSELF)I ran out of shampoo. I had to use
           Rachel's.SETHFor a second there I thought maybe
           you'd fucked Olympia Dukakis.
                         
          Adam tries to close his window. The child safety lock is on.ADAMCan you unlock my window? There's a
           lot of pollen in the air.
                         
          Seth ignores Adam and turns up the music.9.ADAM (CONT'D)(ANNOYED)Seriously, my allergies are flaring
           up. It feels like my nasal cavities
           are on fire.
                         
          Adam begins to clear his throat, Seth turns the music even
          louder.SETHSorry music's too loud, it's making
           it hard for me to hear your
           whining.INT. COFFEE SHOP - LATERWe see the morning bustle as BUSINESS MEN and WOMEN stand in
          line waiting for their morning coffee. Adam and Seth stand at
          the end of that line watching the YOUNG COUPLE in front of
          them who can't keep their hands off of each other.SETHI don't get it, that guy is clearly
           a total douchebag...He's wearing
           Capris!ADAMRachel and I used to be like that;
           like two wild animals in heat...(THINKS)I guess it is only natural though,
           as we get older, more mature,
           things begin to slow down.(BEAT)Sex every three weeks is normal?
           Right?SETH(IN SHOCK)You haven't had sex in three weeks?ADAM(SHRUGS)You think maybe she's mad cause I
           haven't asked her to move in?SETHWhat the fuck are you talking
           about? I don't think she's waiting
           for you to ask anything. You're
           using her shampoo. Next thing
           you'll be using her tampons.10.Seth laughs at his own joke.SETH (CONT'D)But seriously, let me get this
           straight - she has her own place,
           yet she spends every night with
           you, in your bed, but she won't
           sleep with you?ADAMIt's not that big a deal.SETHSo when does it become a big deal?
           Five weeks? Six weeks? A year? My
           cut off...4 days. That's when I
           begin to worry.ADAMDo you realize how lucky I am to be
           with Rachel?SETHLook around, there are like a
           million Rachel's in this city
           alone...well, she's kind of hot, so
           maybe half a million.ADAMBut they're not Rachel. I don't
           know how to explain it, but being
           with her just feels right. And I'm
           not going to overlook that just
           cause we're in a lull.SETHMy parents are in a lull, which is
           what happens after 35 years of
           marriage. You've only been dating
           her four months. At our age sex is
           all we have. Every time she refuses
           to sleep with you a small piece of
           every man's soul dies. She's
           killing us Adam...You're a semi-
           smart, semi-successful, semi-
           average looking dude. Just based on
           that you could get with at least
           one third of the female population.
                         
          Adam and Seth step up to the counter. They're greeted by the
          SUPER GAY BARISTA, who loves his job way too much.BARISTAMorning gentlemen.11.SETH(TO BARISTA)Would you sleep with my friend.BARISTALike, right now?SETHNo just in general.BARISTAYeah, I'd fuck him.
                         
          The Barista yells to DEMETRI, the other Barista.BARISTA (CONT'D)Hey Demetri,(RE: ADAM)Fuckable?
                         
          Demetri examines Adam. He's not impressed with what he sees.DEMETRII'd let you blow me.SETH(TO ADAM)See this is what I'm saying.
                         
          The Barista hands Seth and Adam two cups of coffee, they each
          leave a dollar.INT. SAN DIEGO MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY - LATERAdam and Seth enter the museum. They pass JENNY (30) at the
          information desk.SETH AND ADAMGood morning Jenny.
                         
          Jenny ignores them.SETH(UNDER BREATH)I love you.
                         
          PHIL (60), the museum's vivacious director approaches.PHILSalutations gentlemen.
                         
          Phil sniffs the air and looks at Adam.12.PHIL (CONT'D)Are you wearing perfume?ADAMIt's Rachel's shampoo.
                         
          Phil goes in for a closer sniff. Then an even closer sniff.
          Adam looks uncomfortable.PHIL(DECLARATIVE)Fructis by L'oreal.(IMPRESSED)My wife uses that.(TO SETH)What are you wearing?
                         
          Seth's eyes open wide as Phil goes in for a sniff.PHIL (CONT'D)What is that?SETHAh, mothballs?
                         
          Seth spots a GROUP OF SECOND GRADERS with their TEACHER
          assembled by the entrance.SETH (CONT'D)Looks like my group is here.
                         
          Seth slaps on a button that reads "DOCENT" and rushes off to
          greet the students.SETH (CONT'D)See you guys later.
                         
          Phil turns to Adam.PHILHow's the Origins exhibit coming
           along?ADAMWe're almost done with Upper
           Paleolithic.PHILI'm counting on you not to screw

          Phil stares into Adam's eyes for what feels like an eternity.
          It's incredibly awkward.ADAMPhil?PHILYeah?ADAMI should probably get to work.PHILThat's probably a good idea.
                         
          Phil looks at the clock - 10 a.m.PHIL (CONT'D)I think I'm gonna go to lunch.
                         
          Phil wanders off.INT. MUSEUM. ORIGINS OF MAN EXHIBIT - LATERAdam and GREG (45), Adam's slightly moronic co-worker, place
          the finishing touches on the CRO MAGNON exhibit - it's an
          elaborate life sized diorama depicting the life of a family
          of four Cro Magnons. Outside their hut it's snowing, but
          inside there's a large fire and decorative horse drawings on
          the walls. The MAN instructs his SON to paint as the WOMAN
          teaches her DAUGHTER to sew. We see Greg positioning the
          fossil of a VELOCIRAPTOR next to the mother and daughter. The
          dinosaur looks poised to pounce. Adam notices.ADAMGreg. What are you doing?GREGIt's a velociraptor.ADAMWhere did it come from?GREGThe dinosaur exhibit.
           (off Adam's look)
           Why can't we just say it was the
           first domesticated pet?...People
           love dinosaurs.14.Adam cringes in frustration.ADAMGreg you can't just...that's a 75
           million year old fossil...just
           please, put it away before someone
           sees it.
                         
          Greg reluctantly goes to put the dinosaur away. He flaps the
          dinosaur's arm in the air - waving goodbye to Adam.
                         
          Seth leads his tour of second graders. He speaks like a tour
          guide at Universal Studios.SETHComing up here on our left is the
           "Origins of Man" exhibit on loan
           from the Smithsonian Institute. It

           it's suspected that because
           Neanderthal was a nomadic huntsman,
           he roamed the land, only fending
           for himself - never learning to
           cohabitate with others. So as Cro
           Magnon families settled into
           Europe, they took over the land.
           One by one, Neanderthal was pushed
           out...and never seen, or heard from

          It's not like it's been a conscious

          make adjustments.ADAMSo how do we do that?KATIEThe first thing I want you to do is
          to stop looking at cancer as a
          burden. Cancer has come into your
          life to show you that your
          emotional and physical bodies are
          out of balance. This is your chance
          to correct that.ADAMYou're not in a cult are you?KATIENow, why do you say that?ADAMI don't know, it was a bad joke.37.KATIEBut there's a reason. You chose to

          doesn't mind, in a weird way, Adam is enjoying the attention.

           fucking painting. Her art sucks.
           You don't want to put that on your

           Vesuvius, Pompeii remained hidden
           and forgotten until 1748 when

           site. Here we see exquisitely

          Adam's exhibit is a highly morbid depiction of Pompeii's
          final hours. The scene is total chaos. Ash flies through the
          air. Hot molten lava engulfs the town. Miniature men, women,
          and children run through the streets in horror. People are
          sacrificing whatever they can for the Gods. There's a wild
          orgy in the streets. And a giant TYRANNOSAURS REX model
          devours a villager.ADAM (CONT'D)According to Pliny the Younger -
           "You could hear women lamenting,
           children crying, men shouting.
           There were some so afraid of death
           that they prayed for death. Many
           raised their hands to the gods, and
           even more believed that there were
           no gods any longer, and that this
           was one unending night for the
           world."

          Adam holds the phone away from his ear and cringes. A pang of
          regret runs through his body.ADAMHi mom.INT. HOSPITAL EXAMINATION ROOM - LATEREdith, Art and Adam sit in the exam room, each reading their
          respective magazines - minus Art who is lost somewhere in his
          own world. The tension is thick. Edith looks at her watch and
          shivers. There's a knock at the door. A CUTE NURSE enters.CUTE NURSEThe Doctor wanted me to apologize
           for running late, he's just in with
           another patient, but should be out
           in a few minutes. You guys holding
           up alright?EDITHIt's very cold in here. Is there
           anyway you can turn down the Air

          Adam's pissed that his mother has just involved him.ADAM(smiles to the Nurse)
           Don't worry about it.

           I'm fine.CUTE NURSEAre you sure? I could get you a
           blanket.92.ADAMNo, really, I'm okay. But thank

           We're fine.CUTE NURSEOkay, but you let me know if you
           need anything.
                         
          The Nurse smiles at Adam in sympathy, he smiles back. The
          Cute Nurse exits.EDITH(Re: the cute nurse)
           I don't like her.
                         
          Edith puts her hand on Adam's forehead. He looks at her hand
          and then picks up a magazine in an attempt to ignore her.EDITH (CONT'D)You feel warm.ADAMI'm fine.
                         
          Edith pulls some pills out her fanny pack.EDITHTake these.ADAM(ANNOYED)You're like some kind of deranged
           pusher.EDITHDo you know what it's like to fear
           losing your son? No. You don't.
           When you have children of your own
           we can discuss it. Now take the
           pills.
                         
          Adam puts the pills in his mouth and pretends to swallow.
          Edith gets up from her chair. As soon as his mother turns
          away, Adam spits the pills into his hand.
                         
          Edith paces around the room looking at the Doctor's various
          degrees on the wall.93.Adam looks on, annoyed at every step his mother takes. Edith
          closes in on one of the degrees and puts on her reading
          glasses for further examination.EDITH (CONT'D)(DISAPPROVING)Huh.ADAMWhat?EDITHOh nothing.ADAM(ANNOYED)What?EDITHIt's nothing, he went to a state
           college.ADAMYou're unbelievable.EDITHI just worry that you're not

          Adam can't take it anymore.ADAMWell who needs a doctor when
           they've got you and your fanny
           pack?EDITHYou can be a little shit sometimes,
           you know that? You think I don't
           know what's best for you? I birthed
           you. You came out of me. I am your
           mother, for better or for worse, so
           accept it.

           You don't like this, well I'm
           sorry. It's my own way of caring.ADAM(SNAPS)Well stop! You're driving me crazy.
           With the comments and the pills
           every five minutes. Just stop. I'm
           not dad. I can take care of myself.94.Edith turns away, Adam's words hurt.ADAM (CONT'D)I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
                         
          Edith blows her nose as tears rolls down her cheek.EDITHYes you did. I drive you crazy.
                         
          Adam gently puts his hand on Edith's shoulder.ADAMMom.
                         
          Edith turns to Adam helpless and scared.EDITHYou're all I've got. Look at your
           father.
                         
          We see Art sitting in the chair picking his nose.EDITH (CONT'D)I've lost him. My true love, gone.
           I'm never going see him again, at
           least not in this life.(BEAT)He spent his whole life priding
           himself on his independence, always
           too stubborn to ask for help and
           now look at the son of a bitch.(TO ART)You happy? You like shitting
           yourself?ADAMMom!EDITHHe was the greatest thing to ever
           happen to me. And then I had you,
           and that was even greater. So if I
           hover and threaten your
           independence, so what? You have a
           mother who loves you more than
           anything. Is that so awful?ADAMNo. It's not.
                         
          Adam and Edith share a moment...Dr. Ross storms in the room
          carrying a stack of MRI films. He seems rushed.95.DR. ROSSSorry to keep you folks waiting.
           It's been one of those days...car
           got towed. Wife double parked it.
                         
          Adam and Edith look at Dr Ross with blank stares.DR. ROSS (CONT'D)Anyway I'll cut to the chase. The
           cancer's not responding to the
           chemo.
                         
          Dr. Ross places the MRI into the light box.DR. ROSS (CONT'D)As you can see...The tumor is
           continuing to grow here, along the
           nerve.
                         
          Adam and Edith squint to see what Ross is talking about, but
          see nothing.ADAMSo what do we do?DR. ROSSWe need to operate. If we don't
           remove it soon we risk metastasis.ADAMBut you said surgery was too risky.DR. ROSSWe're out of options.
                         
          Tears roll down Edith's cheek. Adam grabs hold of her hand.EDITHBut he's going to be okay, right?
           You're going to fix it.
                         
          Dr. Ross sits, he knows this can't be easy for a mother.DR. ROSSThis surgery is no guarantee. The
           risks are tremendous. And, even if
           we're able to remove the tumor
           there's still the chance that Adam,
           you'll never be able to walk again.
                         
          Adam looks at his mother. He firmly grabs hold of her hand.96.ADAMDoes that mean...I can get handicap
           parking?
                         
          Adam's line breaks the tension forcing a slight smile across
          Edith's face.INT. ADAM'S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHTDistraught and emotionally worn, Adam enters to discover the

          a thousand pieces.
                         
          Suddenly Rachel's iPhone VIBRATES. She picks it up, and reads
