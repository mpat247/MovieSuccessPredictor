                     FINAL DRAFT 2nd Revision March 2, 1962FADE IN:FULL SHOT - GRANT STREET - SAN FRANCISCO - DAYIt is mid-afternoon, and there is a tempo and pace to the 
	people walking, the doorman HOOTING for taxicabs, the 
	policemen directing traffic.PAN SHOT - PEDESTRIANSwaiting at street corner for light to change.CLOSE SHOT - MANat the end of line of pedestrians. He is looking up at the 
	sky.TWO SHOT - MAN AND WOMAN NEXT TO HIMas she follows his gaze upward.LONG SHOT - THE SKYwith hundreds of gulls in it, wheeling.MED. SHOT - THE STREET CORNERas the light changes and people begin to cross. In the crowd 
	walking the other way, a man turns to look up at the wheeling 
	gulls in the sky overhead. The CAMERA LOCATES:MED. SHOT - MELANIE DANIELSin the crowd of pedestrians, approaching Davidson's Pet Shop.  
	She is a young woman in her mid-twenties, sleekly groomed, 
	exquisitely dressed, though hatless. She walks with the quick 
	sureness of the city dweller, a purposefulness in her stride, 
	a mischievous grin on her face. She continues toward the 
	front door of a pet shop and enters.INT. BIRD SHOP - MED. SHOTMelanie opens the door and comes through, still looking back 
	toward the street and skywards. The proprietor, a MRS.  
	MacGRUDER, comes toward her.MELANIEHello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever 
		seen so many gulls?MRS. MACGRUDERHello, Miss Daniels.MELANIEWhat do you suppose it is?MED. SHOTMrs. MacGruder takes a look out at the sky. A puppy is 
	BARKING, o.s.MRS. MACGRUDER(shaking her head)
		There must be a storm at sea. That 
		can drive them inland, you know.

	They are climbing the short flight of steps into the bird 
	department now. The BARKING of the dog SEGUES into the clamor 
	of innumerable birds, TWEETING, TWITTERING, CAWING as Melanie 
	and Mrs. MacGruder go to the counter at the far end.  There 
	is a circular cage in the center of the room, and the walls 
	are lined with wire-mesh cages and smaller wooden cages so 
	that the effect is one of being surrounded by birds, contained 
	birds to be sure. The birds are quite beautiful, mostly exotic 
	birds, small splashes of color behind the wire-mesh cages, 
	larger bursts of brilliant hue on the parrots and parakeets 
	in the bigger cages. As they walk:MRS. MACGRUDERI was hoping you'd be a little late, 
		Miss Daniels.
			(apologetically)
		You see, he hasn't arrived yet.MELANIEYou said three o'clock.MRS. MACGRUDERI know. Oh, I know.
			(she is more distressed 
			now)
		I've been calling all morning. Oh, 
		you have no idea. Miss Daniels, 
		they're so difficult to get, really 
		they are. We get them from India, 
		you know, when they're just little 
		chicks, and then we have to...MELANIEWell, this one won't be a chick, 
		will he?MRS. MACGRUDERCertainly not. Oh, no. Certainly 
		not. This will be a full grown myna 
		bird. Full grown.MELANIEAnd he'll talk?MRS. MACGRUDERWell, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. 
		You'll have to teach him to talk.MELANIEYes.MRS. MACGRUDERYes.
			(pause)
		Oh my, I suppose I should call them 
		again. They said three o'clock.
			(pause)
		Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call.  
		Would you mind waiting?MELANIE(judiciously)
		I think maybe you'd better deliver 
		him. Let me give you my address.
			(she begins taking 
			off her gloves)MRS. MACGRUDER(producing pencil and 
			pad)
		Oh. Oh, well, all right.

	As Melanie starts writing:MRS. MACGRUDERI'm sure they're on the way, though.  
		Could I just call?MELANIE(with a resigned sigh)
		Well, all right, but...

	She scurries out behind the counter and out of sight.  Melanie 
	finishes writing her address and stands impatiently by the 
	counter. She taps her teeth with the pencil.MRS. MACGRUDER (O.S.)Hello, this is Betty MacGruder at 
		Davidson's.
			(pause; accusingly)
		It's past three, you know.
			(pause)
		Well, how long do you think...? All 
		right, would you check it please?  
		Yes, I'll wait.

	Melanie sighs. Leaving her gloves and purse on the counter, 
	she begins wandering around the shop, still tapping her lips 
	with the pencil. There is no menace in the birds surrounding 
	her. They are active and beautiful as they dart behind the 
	bars and mesh of their cages. Off screen, the puppy begins 
	BARKING again as the front door opens. Melanie looks up.MED. SHOT - MITCH BRENNERas he closes the entrance door behind him and starts up the 
	steps to the bird department. He is a handsome man, about 
	twenty-nine or thirty, well-dressed, and carrying a felt 
	hat.CLOSE SHOT - MELANIEseeing him, and then turning away to bend before the cage of 
	strawberry finches. She pokes the pencil through the mesh.  
	The birds are startled into scarlet flight.TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCHas they pass each other in the aisle. He gives a polite little 
	nod, and she gives a polite little smile. But as he passes 
	her, and unknown to her, he turns for a second look -- and 
	then vanishes behind the circular cage as he turns he corner.MED. SHOT - MELANIElooking at her watch as she wanders around the other side of 
	the cage and then comes face to face with Mitch again.MITCHI wonder if you could help me.MELANIEWhat?MITCH(deliberately, and 
			with a touch of 
			hauteur)
		I said I wonder if you could help 
		me.CLOSE SHOT - MELANIEa trifle annoyed by his manner at first. She is about to 
	inform him, if you please, that she is not a shopgirl. But 
	then something rebellious flashes in her eyes and an idea 
	comes to her.MELANIE(solicitously)
		Yes, what was it you were looking 
		for, sir?TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCHMITCH(deadpan)
		Lovebirds.MELANIELovebirds, sir?MITCHYes. I understand there are different 
		varieties, it that true?MELANIEWell... yes, sir, there are.MITCHThese are for my sister... her 
		birthday you see. As she'll be eleven 
		and... well, frankly, I wouldn't 
		want a pair of birds that were too 
		demonstrative.MELANIEI understand completely, sir.MITCHAs the same time, I wouldn't want 
		birds that were aloof, either.MELANIE(leading him around 
			shop)
		No, of course not.MITCHDo you have a pair that are just 
		friendly?MELANIEI think so, sir.
			(she looks around)
		Now then, let me see.MITCH(at the finches)
		Aren't these lovebirds?MELANIENo, sir, those are... redbirds.MITCHThe sign says strawberry finches.MELANIE(airily)
		Yes, we call them that too.
			(she moves away)
		Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds...
			(and stops before a 
			cage of canaries)MITCHThose are canaries, Miss.
			(pause)
		Doesn't this make you feel awful?MELANIE(baffled)
		Doesn't what make me...?MITCHAll these innocent little creatures 
		caged up like this?MELANIEWell, we can't just let them fly 
		around the shop, you know.MITCHI suppose not. Is there an 
		ornithological reason for keeping 
		them in separate cages?MELANIEOh, certainly. It's to protect the 
		species.MITCHI imagine that's very important.  
		Especially during the moulting season.MELANIEYes, that's a particularly dangerous 
		time.MITCHAre they moulting now?MELANIESome of them are.MITCHHow can you tell?MELANIEWell... they get a sort of hangdog 
		expression.CLOSE SHOT - A CAGED BIRD - MITCH'S P.O.V.The bird is wearing a distinctly hangdog expression.MITCHYes, I see.
			(pause)
		About those lovebirds, Miss...MELANIEAre you sure you wouldn't like to 
		see a canary instead? We have some 
		very nice canaries this week.MITCHAll right.
			(he smiles)
		She smiles back.MITCH(he waits)
		All right, may I see one, please?CLOSE SHOT - MELANIEas she realizes she is expected to take one of the canaries 
	out of the cage. She smiles feebly, glances toward the counter 
	where she expects Mrs. MacGruder to reappear momentarily, 
	and then takes a deep breath. She opens the door to the canary 
	cage, and cautiously puts her hand into it.MELANIE(feebly)
		Here, birdie. Here, birdie, birdie.

	One of the canaries suddenly flutters out of the cage and 
	into the room. Melanie leaps back, startled.MELANIEOh!  Ohhhhh!FULL SHOT - THE BIRD DEPARTMENTas the canary flies frantically about the room, Melanie and 
	Mitch in pursuit. Mrs. MacGruder appears at the counter, 
	finally confronted with the chaos she's been expecting all 
	day.MRS. MACGRUDERWhat is it? Oh! Oh my, one of the 
		birds is loose!

	She joins in the chase around the room. The bird flutters up 
	to the ceiling, and then lands on the counter and watches 
	them suspiciously.MITCHShhh! Shhhh!

	He tiptoes up to the bird, hat in hand. Quickly, he covers 
	the bird with his hat, then reaches under to grab it.CLOSE SHOT - MITCHthe canary in his hand.MELANIEThere we are!MRS. MACGRUDEROh, good! Oh, wonderful.FULL SHOT - THE BIRD DEPARTMENTas Mitch carries the canary back to the cage. He opens the 
	door.MITCH(putting the canary 
			in)
		Back into your gilded cage, Melanie 
		Daniels.CLOSE SHOT - MELANIEstartled.MELANIEWhat did you say?TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCHMITCH(savoring this)
		I was merely drawing a parallel, 
		Miss Daniels.MELANIEBut how... how do you know my name?MITCH(secretly)
		A little birdie told me.
			(he smiles politely)
		Good day, Miss Daniels.
			(he bows to Mrs.  
			MacGruder)
		Madam.
			(he starts out)MELANIEHey, wait a minute!

	She goes after him. Mitch turns, stops, smiles, enjoying her 
	bafflement immensely. Melanie studies him. Then:MELANIEI don't know you.MITCHAhhh, but I know you.MELANIEHow?MITCHWe met in court.MELANIEWe never met in court or anyplace 
		else.MITCHThat's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw 
		you in court.MELANIEWhen?MITCHDo you remember one of your practical 
		jokes that resulted in the smashing 
		of a plate glass window?MELANIEI didn't break that window!MITCHNo, but your little prank did. The 
		judge should have put you behind 
		bars!MELANIEWhat are you? A policeman?MITCHI simply believe in the law, Miss 
		Daniels, and I'm not too keen on 
		practical jokers.MELANIEWhat do you call your lovebird story 
		if not a practical...MITCHAhhh, but I really do want those 
		birds.MELANIEYou knew I didn't work here. You 
		deliberately...MITCHRight. I recognized you when I came 
		in. I thought you might like to know 
		what it felt like to be on the other 
		end of a gag. What do you think of 
		that, Miss Daniels?MELANIEI think you're a louse.MITCHI am.
			(he tips his hat)
		Good day.
			(to Mrs. MacGruder)
		Madam.
			(and he goes down the 
			steps)MELANIEAnd I'm glad you didn't get your 
		lovebirds!MITCH(breezily, as he goes 
			out)
		I'll find something else.
			(he gives a slight 
			bow)
		See you in court some day.

	As Melanie begins writing:MRS. MACGRUDERThey said the myna bird would be 
		here later this afternoon. If you'd 
		care to come back...MELANIENo, you'd better send him. May I use 
		your phone?MRS. MACGRUDER(bewildered by 
			everything)
		Yes, certainly.

		Do you have any lovebirds?MRS. MACGRUDERNo, not in the shop. But I can order 
		them for you.MELANIEHow soon?MRS. MACGRUDERWell... well, how soon would you 
		want them?MELANIEImmediately.

		Is this the Daily News? Melanie 
		Daniels. Would you get me the city

		That would be just fine.

	waiting. Behind her, the inner door is BUZZING wildly with 
	answering BUZZES. Melanie and the man stand waiting for the

	elevator doors close.TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE MAN - IN THE ELEVATORThe birds are CHIRPING wildly in their cage. The man and 
	Melanie stand silently side by side. The man's eyes wander 
	down to the bird-cage. Melanie's eyes move toward him.  Self-

	He looks at Melanie.CLOSE SHOT - MELANIEsmiling at him feebly.FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDORThe man spread change and an assortment of junk on the palm

	And she steps into the elevator.DISSOLVEFULL SHOT - MELANIE'S OPEN CAR - (MATTE)on the coast highway. It is a spectacularly beautiful day, 
	with a cloudless blue sky. The montage of SHOTS that follow 
	should alternate between the winding, twisting road and the 
	ocean below, and CLOSEUPS of Melanie driving with the caged 
	birds on the seat beside her. The last shot should be a FULL 
	SHOT of the car rounding a particularly sharp curve.CLOSE SHOT - MELANIEShe turns wheel forcefully.CLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDSin the cage as the car rounds the bend. They lean to one

	him, then stops, turns and looks at her surprised, as if 
	he'd expected her to be right behind him. He stands stock 
	still, looking at her, saying nothing. She understands then 
	that he wants her to follow him, and she catches up, neither 
	speaking. They go to the front door. He opens it, looks at 
	her, then looks out across the town and the bay. He extends 
	his arm and points.CLERKSee where I'm pointing?MELANIEYes?FULL SHOT - THE BAY - THEIR P.O.V. - (MATTE)CLERK (O.S.)See them two big trees across there?MELANIE (O.S.)Yes?CLERK (O.S.)And the white house?MELANIE (O.S.)That's where the Brenners live.TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE CLERKMELANIEThe Brenners?

	two, tall, big-boned, with a strong beautiful face.  Her 
	hair is disarrayed at the moment, and she is dressed for the

	There is an awkward pause. Annie shrugs.ANNIELook, I see no reason for being coy

		I was seeing quite a lot of him in

		went through a lot with Lydia after 
		his father died. He didn't want to 
		risk going through it all over again.MELANIEI see.ANNIESo it ended. Not immediately, of

		Bay?ANNIEYou get straight to the point, don't 
		you?MELANIEI'm sorry. Forgive me.ANNIENo, that's all right, I don't mind.  
		I came up here for two reasons. To 
		begin with, I was bored with my job 
		in San Francisco. I was teaching at 
		a private school there... well, you 
		know, you probably went to one 
		yourself.MELANIEI did.ANNIEThen you know. Little girls in brown 
		beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. 
		I'll go into that classroom on Monday 
		morning, and I'll look out at twenty-
		five upturned little faces, and each 
		of them will be saying, 'Yes, please 
		give me what you have.'
			(pause)
		And I'll give them what I have. I 
		haven't got very much, but I'll give 
		them every ounce of it. To me, that's 
		very important. It makes me want to 
		stay alive for a long long time.
			(she sighs)
		That's the first reason.MELANIEAnd the second?ANNIE(simply)
		I wanted to be near Mitch.
			(pause)
		It was over, and I knew it, but I 
		wanted to be near him, anyway.
			(she smiles)
		You see, I still like him a hell of 
		a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't 
		want to lose his friendship... ever.

	to the wing chair in the foreground and stays on her 
	throughout following, recording her reactions as Melanie 
	talks to Mitch in the background.

	Annie is not devastated by this call, and yet there is a 
	wistfulness to her expression as she realizes she may finally 
	and irrevocably be losing Mitch to another girl.MELANIE(at phone; coolly)
		Hello? Yes, this is Melanie. Fine,

	She hangs up and looks at Annie in embarrassment.MELANIEHe wants me to go to Cathy's party

		I said I would.ANNIEI'll be going, too, to help out. It

	She smiles, takes out a flowered muumuu, holds it up to Annie.ANNIEPretty. Did you get that at

	Melanie nods and drapes the muumuu over her arm. She is silent

			(she walks to door)
		Who is it?

	clustered around a long folding table upon which are 
	sandwiches, ice cream and soft drinks. The parents are either 
	helping the children to more or telling them they are having 
	too much. There is a general SOUND of kid's CHATTER and 
	LAUGHTER. Coming up the sloping path, away from the party, 
	are Melanie and Mitch. The CAMERA PANS them UP the slope and 
	away from the party in background. As they turn the hairpin 
	bend of the slope, and come up toward the CAMERA, we see the 
	entrance of the harbor and the Pacific in the background. 
	The CAMERA PANS them as they come near to us and, once more, 
	the party is in the background. Mitch and Melanie pass the 
	CAMERA out to the left.CLOSER SHOT - THE TOP OF THE DUNESMelanie and Mitch come INTO the picture from the right and 
	stand against the sky. Mitch takes a martini shaker from one 
	of his pockets, and two glasses from the other. He hands one

	she is accounting for it, it sounds a little meaningless and 
	unimportant.MELANIEAnd on Tuesdays, I take a course in

	She leans over and whispers in his ear. They both burst out 
	LAUGHTER. But then suddenly, a very serious look comes into 
	Melanie's face.CLOSE SHOT - MELANIEserious, introspective.MELANIEThat's silly, isn't it?  Teaching a

	way of a short cut and are not on the zig-zag path. As they 
	reach the lawn they move along the side of it at the foot of 
	the dunes. They are absorbed in each other. The CAMERA PANS 
	OFF them and BRING INTO the picture Annie, surrounded by the 
	children. She is in the act of changing the blindfold from 
	Michele to Cathy. She hands Michele her glasses back.  During 
	this, and while she is putting the blindfold round the eyes 
	of Cathy, she is looking to her right and obviously is 
	watching Mitch and Melanie.MITCH AND MELANIE - ANNIE'S P.O.V.MED. SHOT - ANNIECAMERA MOVES A LITTLE to her left (CAMERA RIGHT). At this

	She says all this while still looking toward the couple. She 
	turns her head away from the couple with a new expression on 
	her face. She twists completely around to look at Lydia as 
	though she were wondering if Lydia sees what she sees.  
	Suddenly we HEAR a little boy's voice crying:LITTLE BOY (O.S.)Look! Look!

	His hand hesitates. Then his thumb and forefinger lift the 
	small catch on the cage door. His fingers open the door.  
	Cautiously, in TIGHT CLOSEUP, his hand goes into the cage.  
	The birds sit and watch. One of them tweets. He removes the 
	small feeding tray, puts the bird seed into it, replaces it 
	in the cage. The birds hesitate another moment. Then, 
	tweeting, they begin to eat.FULL SHOT - THE DINING ROOMas Mitch closes the door to the cage. Melanie is slumped 
	against the wall. He goes to her and takes her in his arms.

	There is something pathetically comic about her voice, like

	and steadily. The house is almost still. There is no longer

	doorknob, pulls it taut across the hallway, and ties it to 
	the bannister, sealing the door. He turns immediately to
