                    It would be way too easy to say
                    Stan preys on the weak because he's
                    simply a dick. No, Stan's more
                    complex than that. According to
                    leading psychiatrists Stan is a
                    bully for 1 of 3 reasons. 1, under
                    all that male bravado there's an
                    insecure little girl banging on the
                    closet door trying to get out. 2,
                    like a caveman, Stan's brain is
                    underdeveloped. Therefore Stan is
                    unable to use self-control so he
                    acts out aggressively. And the
                    third reason-Mike holds up his pinky then spins the ball on it.MIKE (CONT'D)I'd argue that Stan suffers from
                    all 3.The entire cafeteria LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY.Mike feigns whipping it back at Stan, who recoils, then
