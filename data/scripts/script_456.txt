                stick to it. It only takes 30 days

                second nature.OSCAR (O.S.)Really? Who told you that?SOPHINA (O.S.)... Oprah

      Oscar laughs hard at this.SOPHINA (CONT'D)What's yours.OSCARI'm gonna quit selling trees.                          

      The PHONE VIBRATES and RINGS "MARCUS CALLING" shows on the
      outer screen.

      Oscar's moves towards the cellphone.SOPHINA (O.S.)Osc.

      Sophina doesn't answer. The phone rings again. Oscar's hand
      quickly picks it up and flips it open. We follow the phone to
      his face and we see him for the first time, a 22 year old
      Black man with a warm smile.OSCAR (CONT'D)(into phone)
                Aye bruh it's bad tonight. I gotta
                catch you tomorrow.

      He closes it before the guy on the other end can respond. He
      takes the phone with him as he climbs back into bed with
      SOPHINA MESA, a curvy 24 year old Mexican American woman.OSCAR (CONT'D)Look, I'm not going out, you happy
                now?

      Sophina nods. Oscar moves closer to her and kisses her on her
      neck. She kisses him back a bit, then scoots away.                  

      Oscar kisses her again. Puts his hand in her hair.SOPHINAOsc. Osc, hold up.

      Oscar stops. Sophina scoots away even further.(CONTINUED)Pink (6/25/2012)                                              5.2      CONTINUED:                                                   2OSCARMan, wussup? I been home hella

      Sophina looks at him, searching for the truth in his eyes.SOPHINAWhat you mean, forever?OSCARLet me show you.

      Oscar kisses her, moves in. Sophina scoots away from him.

      Oscar jumps up and grabs the bag of weed off of the dresser
      and hides it in the closet.

      He rushes over and opens the door where we see TATIANA GRANT,
      a cute 4 year old girl, standing wearing footie pajamas.TATIANAI can't sleep...

      Before Tatiana can even finish, Oscar has her in his arms. He
      brings her over to the bed and places her next to Sophina.OSCARYou want to sleep in here with
                Mommy and Daddy?

      Tatiana nods.SOPHINAYou know better than that T.

      types the message, the words appear as graphics across the

      oiled machine. Sophina, wearing a WalMart uniform, makes two
      lunches. Oscar wipes milk from Tatiana's face and fixes her
      hair.TATIANAMommy can I have two of the fruit
                snacks today?SOPHINANo, T. You can take an extra apple
                if you want.TATIANABut mommy I-SOPHINADon't argue T.

                gas too.OSCARWe got enough to get yall there.

      Sophina and Tatiana leave. Oscar watches them go for a beat.
      He turns to the cabinet.5     OMITTED                                                       56     EXT. FIRST FRUIT LEARNING CENTER- DAY                         6Oscar and Tatiana walk to the downstairs entrance of a two
      story house. A picture of an apple tree is painted next to
      the door. Oscar squats down to her level and brushes down a
      frizz in her hair. He looks back at the car.

      We see that Sophina is adjusting her make up in the fold down
      mirror.

      Oscar turns to Tatiana. He then takes her hand, and places
      something inside of it.

      Tatiana looks down into her hand and we see that it is a
      small bag of fruit snacks. She looks up at Oscar with a
      bright eyed expression. But Oscar quickly places his finger
      over his lips.

      Tatiana nods in agreement, trying to hold back a huge smile.
      She gives him a swift kiss on the cheek. He stands up and
      knocks on the front door.

      the door.MRS. STACYGood morning Tatiana!(CONTINUED)Green (7/5/2012)                                           9.6      CONTINUED:                                                6TATIANAGood morning Mrs. Stacy.

      Tatiana heads into the house.

      Oscar smiles at Mrs. Stacey, and she nods back. He watches
      Tatiana run off into house.7     OMITTED                                                      78     INT. SOPHINA'S CAR- WALMART PARKING LOT- DAY                 8Oscar and Sophina look on at the WAL MART Entrance.OSCARSee? Told you we'd make it. The
                light aint even on yet.

      She looks at the dashboard where there is a PICTURE of Oscar
      holding Tatiana tucked in the glass. The fuel gage sits
      almost under E, but the light still isn't on.

      She stares at the store entrance.SOPHINAYou gonna go home and sleep, right?OSCARNaw, Imma go up to the job. Get
                some stuff for tonight.SOPHINAUgh. I'd rather die than come here

Sophina smiles at the idea of Frisco, for a beat.SOPHINA (CONT'D)Let me get in here.(CONTINUED)Pink (6/25/2012)                                             10.8       CONTINUED:                                                   8She quickly sits up. Oscar leans over to give her a kiss on
       the cheek, makes a farting sound on her neck instead.

       Sophina chuckles at this as she gets out of the car.SOPHINA (CONT'D)Bye.OSCAR(playfully)
                 Love you too.

       SLAM! Sophina shuts the door on him. Oscar laughs. His smile
       fades, as he watches her go inside.9      INT. SOPHINA'S CAR- DAY                                       9Oscar, now in the car by himself rides in the car listening
       to HIP HOP MUSIC. He comes to a red light.

       He looks at the car radio clock: 8:58 AM.

       He thinks to himself for a beat, he looks dissatisfied. He
       turns his music up for a beat and listens to it. He looks
       around, still not at ease. He turns off his music and pulls
       out his cellphone. He takes a quick look around to see what
       cars are around, before dialing numbers. CALLING MOM flashes
       on the screen. He holds the phone to his ear.INTERCUT WITH:10     EXT. UPS WAREHOUSE ENTRANCE- DAY                             10A beautiful Black woman in her late 40's wears a UPS
       manager's uniform, this is WANDA JOHNSON. She walks towards
       the entrance of her store, when her cellphone rings in her
       purse. She pulls it out, stressed. Answers it without
       looking.WANDAHello?OSCARLast shot right here, you sure you

       He pulls the car over.

       He looks around for his earpiece for beat- no luck. He takes
       his cellphone, and slides it into the elastic of his beanie-
       a poor man's Bluetooth. He pulls off.OSCAR (CONT'D)Hello?WANDAIt's on now?OSCARYeah Ma.WANDAOkay pick up a couple of packets of

        Wanda hangs up the phone. She looks at it for a beat. Then
        puts it back in her purse and heads into the warehouse.A11     EXT. FARMER JOE'S PARKING LOT- DAY- MOMENTS LATER         A11We see the entrance of Farmer Joe's, and shoppers coming in

        move about the aisles. Oscar walks over to the seafood
        section where Cato CALDWELL, a 22 year old charismatic Black       
        male stands behind the counter wearing a Deli apron.

        Cato sees Oscar and smiles brightly. He takes a pile of fish       
        off the scale, bags it, ands it to an older BLACK WOMAN. He
        takes off his clear glove and slaps hands with Oscar over the
        counter.CATOSup Osc, bruh?OSCARShit. What's good?CATOYou lookin for Emi?OSCARYeah. He here today?CATOHell yeah he is. He was just over

                 shit-

       Oscar sees something out of the corner of his eye. He motions
       his head for Cato to look. Cato turns and sees-                  

       KATIE, a White girl in her mid 20's, playing with her iPhone
       while waiting for help. Cato quickly makes his way over.CATOYou ready?KATIEUh, yeah... I want to get a pound

       down to her phone.KATIE (CONT'D)Okay but, I want to fry it. Like a
                 fish fry. Are these the ones you
