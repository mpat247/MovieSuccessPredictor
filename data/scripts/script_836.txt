Story by John C. RichardsShooting Script (FINAL)3/9/99FADE IN:1     INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY                                1A tense surgery in progress.  Meters flicker, instruments
            flash in the bright overhead light.  In the midst of it all
            stands DR. DAVID RAVELL, 35.  The master of his domain.
            Ravell leans forward so a NURSE can mop the sweat from his
            brow as he completes a last, delicate procedure.  His co
            workers sigh collectively with relief.DAVID(to Asst. Surgeon)
                      Close her up, will you?2     INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY                             2Dr. Ravell comes out of surgery, clearly exhausted.  Without
            his surgical mask he is ruggedly handsome.  TWO NURSES
            follow, attending him like a fighter fresh from the ring:
            CHLOE, 25, Raven-haired and striking, and JASMINE, 24, an
            exotic mix of African-American and Asian.

            BLAKE DANIELS, 58, the silver-haired Chief Surgeon, rushes up
            the corridor.  On his heels is DR. LONNIE WALSH, 33. Lonnie
            is also conspicuously handsome, but he'll always be second to
            David.  In everything.
            The look on Blake's face stops David in his tracks.BLAKEThere's been a train crash near Santa
                      Barbara. They're flying an aortal trauma
                      here now.  How can I ask you this,
                      David...

            David rubs his eyes.  Thinks about it.DAVIDI can do it, Blake.

            His bravery isn't lost on the two nurses, although Chloe
            exchanges a quick, covert glance with Lonnie.CHLOEIs he crazy, Jasmine?   He's been on his
                      feet for fourteen hours.JASMINEChloe, it's been this way since Leslie
                      died.  Losing himself in his work, poor
                      thing...2.YOUNGER MAN'SVOICE(O.S.)... I'll give you something to lose
                      yourself in...OLDER MAN'S VOICE(O.S.)Excuse me, miss?PULL BACK TO REVEAL: WE ARE LOOKING AT A TELEVISION SCREENBEHIND THE COUNTER OF A SMALL-TOWN DINER.INSERT:            FAIR OAKS, KANSAS3     INT. TIP TOP DINER - DAY                                 3Quaint, Midwestern eatery.  Knick-knacks and photos abound.
            The booths and counter are packed with LOCALS.  A family
            dining section off in one corner.

            TWO GUYS sitting at the counter in team jackets.  The older
            of the two holds up his empty coffee cup.  But his WAITRESS,
            standing a couple seats down from him, doesn't move. She's
            completely absorbed in watching the soap opera that plays on
            two battered, fuzzy TV sets.
            BETTY SIZEMORE, 30, has a wholesome attractiveness that
            competes with a bit too much makeup and a cheesy white
            waitress uniform. TWO OTHER WAITRESSES attend to customers
            behind her.
            The younger of the two guys is involved in the soap opera.
            But the older one, still wants coffee.  He gestures toward
            Betty.OLDER MANMiss?

            Betty leans forward, grabs the coffee pot and moves in front
            of him.  Without taking her eyes from the TV, she pours the
            java, which somehow lands in his cup without spilling a drop.OLDER MAN(cont'd)
                      Very impressive.  That is very...
                          (turning to others)
                      Did anybody see that?

            The LOCAL GUYS around him don't even bother to look up. Of
            course, they've seen it before.  Betty smiles.3.OLDER MAN(cont'd)
                      Thank you.  Could I bother you for a
                      little more...?

            Before he can even finish, Betty is topping him off with
            milk.BETTYSkim, right?
                          (tears open an Equal)
                      And half a pack, if I remember correct...

            The older gentleman's mouth works a bit but nothing comes
            out.  He is flabbergasted by her attention to detail.  She
            looks at the younger man, who is still following the show and
            gobbling down a huge bacon burger.

                                BETTY (cont'd)
                      You know, you're never too young to start
                      on a lean meat substitute...(BEAT)You wanna try some turkey bacon on that?YOUNGER MANYou want a tip when I'm through?BETTYIt's your body...

            Betty turns back to change pots.  The older man watches her
            intently as the younger of the two mumbles to himself.YOUNGER MAN(to himself)
                      That's right, so why don't you get up off

                      the suggestion.BETTYNo problem.

            Betty flashes the men a winning smile and moves off, one eye
            always on the TV as she approaches two local types.

            SHERIFF ELDEN BALLARD, 32, a short, tightly wound little man,
            sitting at his own booth.  Ballard is spit and polish all the
            way:  creases in his shirt, a glossy shine on his shoes.
            Badge proudly displayed.  He sits with4.ROY OSTREY, 31, a gangly, bookish local reporter.  Betty
            drops five ketchup packets and four mayonnaise packets on the
            table for him.  Another smile.ROYHi, Betty.  You're looking good...BETTYThanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar,
                      but sweet.  I liked your editorial this
                      morning...ROYOh, appreciate it.  I was trying to, ahh,
                      give a sense of history to...BALLARD(interrupting)
                      Yeah, it was great.  Really put the whole
                      idea of "church bake sales" in
                      perspective...ROYYou know, Elden, some people actually
                      read more than just the Classifieds...BALLARDWhy don't you go back to doing something
                      you're good at... like that Lonelyhearts
                      column?
                          (chuckles to himself)
                      I'll take a refill there, Betty...

            His cup is full before he can even finish the sentence.BETTYHey, Sheriff.  How's everything?BALLARDOh, you know, the usual... keeping the
                      world safe.BETTY... I meant your food.BALLARDOh, right... 's fine.  Thanks.ROYI thought you said the eggs weren't...BALLARDIt's fine.  Mind your own meal...5.ROYYou should get the order you want.BALLARDAnd you should keep your nose out of
                      another man's omelette...
                          (to Betty)
                      It's no big deal, Betty.BETTYThere's yolks in there, huh?  It's no
                      prob'... gotta keep you on track.

            Betty grabs Ballard's plate without another word, gives him a
            reassuring rub on the shoulders and moves off.  He smiles
            appreciatively after her, then turns on Roy.BALLARDWhy you always gotta embarrass me?  I
                      been eating lunch with you since grade
                      school and you always gotta embarrass me!ROYThey're just eggs, Elden, how
                      embarrassing can eggs be?BALLARD... plentyROYWho eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?BALLARDMind your own business.  You just said
                      that shit so you could look at her a
                      little longer, anyway...

            Still carrying Ballard's plate, she returns to the counter.BETTYCome on, guys, I told you it's egg whites
                      only for the Sheriff...
                          (quietly)
                      ... I put him in that 'zone' thing.COOK #1Well, it better be a pretty good size
                      zone if he's in it...

            Betty and the cooks share a quick laugh.  They move to change
            his order while Betty glances up at the TV.6.4     INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - RETURN TO TV SCREEN             4Lonnie catches up to Blake in the corridor.LONNIEBlake, I can handle that transplant!BLAKEWe need someone with the right kind of
                      experience, Lonnie.LONNIEEven if he's falling asleep on his feet?BLAKELonnie, it's a complex procedure.  Why
                      don't you observe?LONNIEI'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh
                      out of medical school, Blake.BLAKENo, you're not.  You're a good doctor,
                      Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell.
                      I've made my decision.  Now, if you'll
                      excuse me ...

            Blake exits.  The camera moves in to hold on a CLOSEUP of
            Lonnie's face as he simmers in anger.  Music soars.5     INT. TIP TOP DINER - DAY                                 5Plates of food are piling up on the shelf in front of the
            COOKS.  One of them turns the TV off by remote.BETTYHey!  We were watching that!COOK #1The other girls've got orders up... we're
                      not one 'a them goddamn Nelson families,
                      y'know.

            Betty snatches up several plates to help out.  Ballard's food
            appears with A CLATTER of porcelain.BETTYIt's "Nielson"...COOK #1Yeah, well, we ain't one 'a them,
                      neither.7.(BEAT)Go on now...DARLENEWhen you gonna get those things fixed,
                      anyhow?COOK #1When you all quit watching 'em for a
                      living...

            Frustrated, Betty delivers several plates and drops them at
            tables where the people know her by name.  She moves off
            toward FOUR LOCAL GUYS in a booth jangling their empty cups.
            Betty weaves her way over to them and pours refills.  When a
            hand strays around to touch her ass, she pushes it away with
            her foot and keeps right on pouring. Absently, Betty takes a
            look around the restaurant.  The other waitresses are gone
            and no one is behind the grill.  Alarmed, she pushes through
            the double doors into the kitchen.6     INT. TIP TOP DINER - KITCHEN - SAME TIME                 6THREE WAITRESSES, along with the DISHWASHER and TWO COOKS are
            standing in a row waiting for her.BETTY... alright, I get it, no more TV.
                      Sorry.

            No one moves, then DARLENE leads them in a huge SURPRISE!
            They produce a life-size cardboard cut-out of Dr. David
            Ravell, who looks dashing in his green hospital scrubs.
            Betty backs up in disbelief.

                                BETTY (cont'd)
                      Oh my gosh, this is so embarrassing!

                      know.WAITRESS #2C'mon, Betty!  Pose with him!

            Betty laughs and puts her arm around the cardboard man.  A
            flash photo is taken.  A cupcake with a single candle is
            placed in her hands.DARLENEOne candle... uh-oh, you're getting up
                      there!  Doesn't David like 'em young?BETTYI'm over the hill, what can I say?

            Darlene gives Betty an envelope with cash showing.WAITRESS #1A little something for those nursing
                      classes you've been wanting to take...DARLENE... but keep putting off thanks to a
                      certain husband we won't mention...BETTYOh, guys, you didn't have to do that!DARLENESo how you gonna celebrate?  Del takin'
                      you into Wichita for a big fancy dinner?

            The others laugh; they know better.  So does Betty.BETTYYeah, Dairy Queen, maybe...  Oh, I should
                      probably call him.  Thanks, you guys...COOK #1Alright, alright, come on... I'm not

            Smiling, Betty grabs a wall phone as the others mingle about.7     INT. SIZEMORE MOTORS - DEL'S OFFICE - DAY                7The trailer/office of a small-time car dealership. As the
            PHONE RINGS, the CAMERA PANS across pictures of DEL SIZEMORE,
            35, dressed as Napoleon, Caesar and Abe Lincoln, arms raised
            in a high-energy sales pitch.9.The PHONE RINGS again.  We see a framed certificate of
            achievement from General Motors, dated 1986.

            After the THIRD RING an ANSWERING MACHINE clicks on. It's
            loud.ANSWERING MACHINE(Del's voice)

            lounge, screwing his secretary, JOYCE.  But as he rocks the
            couch, he's listening to Betty's message.BETTY  (V.O.)I know you want the Oldsmobile back
                      tonight, so... I was wondering if I could
                      take one of the new Buicks.

            Del pulls out and lurches across the room.  He reaches for
            the desk phone but misses, spilling down onto the carpet.  He
            gathers himself and his pants up in disgust, pawing around
            the desktop until he finds the phone.BETTY  (V.O.)(CONT'D)So, call me when you--DELWhoa, whoa, whoa!  Hang on a second
                      there, baby.  Why do you need one of the
                      new Buicks?BETTY  (V.O.)Oh, you're there.  You sound out of
                      breath.DELI ran back in to get the phone.10.The answering machine is on, so their VOICES are BOOMING. The
            phone cord is stretched across the trailer as he tries to get
            back to Joyce.  He motions for her to join him but she
            remains where she is, fuming.BETTY  (V.O.)I don't need one, but it's kind of a
                      special night, and--DELWhat's so special about it?

            LONG PAUSE. Joyce looks at Del, incredulous. Then pissed off.
            He signals to hold on.BETTY  (V.O.)Sue Ann's taking me out and I thought it
                      might be fun to go in a nice car...

            Joyce wriggles to a sitting position and begins to pull up
            her panties.  Del shoots her a look that says 'I'm not
            finished yet!'  They pantomime frantically back and forth
            until Joyce throws him the finger and SLAMS out the door.BETTY (V.O)(CONT'D)What was that?DELNothing... it's, ahh, busy here.  Look,
                      you don't need a LeSabre to go out with
                      Sue Ann.  Take the blue Corsica.  I'll
                      see you when I get home.

            He throws the phone onto the cradle, then bangs on a window
            to get Joyce's attention as she fires up a smoke.DEL (CONT'D)(through the pane)
                      Shit!  Joyce, open the damn gate, will
                      you?!

            As Del zips up his pants Joyce trudges across the lot to
            bring in the "Closed For Lunch" sign and open the gate.  Del
            silently studies the much nicer car lot next door for a
            moment.  He takes in the banners, the signs, etc.

            up, irritated, and says something under her breath to the
            caller.JOYCEUhh, no, we haven't picked a date yet...
                      well, once he dumps her we will.

                      a livelier look" or something.

            Betty nods and swaps her car keys for a set Joyce gives her.

                      'S too bad about the LeSabres... they're
                      a really sweet ride.

            As Joyce prattles on, Betty notices the Buick LeSabre keys on
            a rack behind her.  She sidles around Joyce, deftly removes a

            She whispers, then laughs loudly as Betty leaves.10     EXT. SIZEMORE MOTORS - DAY                              10The cardboard doctor is standing next to Betty's Olds.  She
            thinks about leaving him, but picks him up and tosses him
            into a blue Corsica.  He lands with his face against the
            passenger window.

            She stands for a moment by the Corsica, dangling the LeSabre
            keys before her eyes.  Suddenly, she jumps inside the
            Chevrolet and slams the door.11     EXT. SIZEMORE MOTORS/TRAILER PARK - DAY                 11The blue Corsica leaves the parking lot and pulls onto the
            street.  The car makes an abrupt turn into a trailer park
            directly behind the car lot and glides to a halt behind a row
            of battered airstreams.

            Betty gets outs of the Chevy and looks back:  the handsome
            face of Doctor David Ravell is staring at her from the car.BETTYOh, Christ, what am I gonna do with you?

            She goes back to pick him up, then starts off.12     EXT. TRAILER PARK - SAME TIME                           12A row of cheap trailers on both sides of a crumbling
            driveway.  Betty appears with her cardboard man tucked under
            one arm and then disappears behind a pickup truck.13.13     EXT. SIZEMORE MOTORS - SAME TIME                        13She tosses the cardboard "David" over a concrete slab wall,
            climbs over herself and walks straight to the LeSabres.  Her
            key opens the last one - maroon. She puts the doctor on the
            passenger seat, gets in the car and inhales the new car
            smell.

            Joyce can be seen inside the trailer, still talking on the
            phone.  She misses the whole scene as she works on her nails.BETTYWe deserve this.14     INT. LESABRE - DRIVING - DAY                            14Betty has the car at 75 m.p.h., on the rural Kansas roads,
            wheat fields for miles on both sides of her.  The RADIO is
            blasting Bonnie Raitt and she's singing along.

            She sees her speed and punches the accelerator ... 80 m.p.h.
            ... 85 ... 90 m.p.h.  She turns the radio up louder.

            When she approaches a sign saying "You are leaving Kansas"
            Betty suddenly becomes self-conscious.  She eases up on the
            gas ... slows down ... does a U-turn and heads back toward
            Fair Oaks.  She glances wistfully in her rear view mirror at
            the billboard that quickly fades into the distance.15     EXT. BETTY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - LATER                       15Betty enters a modest residential neighborhood and pulls into
            a driveway.  She parks in a detached garage and looks over at
            the cardboard David.  There's no way he's going in the house.
            She puts him in the trunk and closes the garage door.16     EXT. SUE ANN'S HOUSE - SAME TIME                        16She walks several houses down.  On her way to the door we
            hear a DOG BARKING, CHILDREN and GENERAL COMMOTION from
            inside.  SUE ANN ROGERS answers Betty's knock.  Her hair is
            matted with sweat as she struggles with CHILDREN, ages 4, 3
            and 6 months.  Suddenly, Sue Ann is hit by an errant rubber
            ball.SUE ANNHey, darling... oww!  Sorry, got my own
                      little Gulf War going on here.

            Betty takes the baby as Sue Ann pulls a videotape from a
            shelf.  It's all one move; they do this every day.14.BETTYDid you watch it yet?SUE ANNSure did. I'll tell you, if that man was

                      a birthday, right?  I'll have another one
                      next year...

            Betty forces a smile, kisses the baby and hands it back to
            Sue Ann, who hands her the videotape.SUE ANNAahhh...(BEAT)So what color is it?15.BETTYWhat?SUE ANNThe LeSabre!BETTYMaroon.(BEAT)I stole it.SUE ANNWhat?BETTYHe wasn't going to let us use it, so I

            Betty throws her a look as Sue Ann closes the door.  Betty
            turns around, frustrated.  She starts yanking her apron off
            as she crosses the street.17     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DAY                                17A low-end ranch.  A worn-out sofa and loveseat form an 'L'
            that dominates the living room.  Romance novels line a small
            bookcase.  SIX CANARIES in cages chatter away in the kitchen.

            Del sits at the dining room table, agitated.  He is presently
            attacking a pork chop, baked beans and a loaf of Wonderbread.
            All we hear is A FORK CLICKING and BIRDS CHIRPING.  Betty
            stands at the breakfast counter, barefoot, still in her
            uniform and quietly eating a salad.BETTYSure you don't want any salad?DELNo, I do not want any goddamn... what was

                      real potential.

            Del BELCHES, smiles, then CLUCKS at the birds nearby.BETTY... like the water purifiers?DELWhat?BETTYOr the vitamins?  Or the...?

            Del almost comes out of his chair, pointing his finger at
            her.DELHey, the FDA screwed me on that when they
                      changed the law, and you know it!(BEAT)Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some

            Truce for a moment.  Del plucks a copy of Soap Opera Guide
            from Betty's purse while absently taking a bite from Betty's
            cupcake.  He narrowly misses the candle.

            She drops the dishes with a clatter, pours herself a glass of

            quick refrain of "Happy Birthday" to herself.18     INT. LONNIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (ON TV SCREEN)          18Standing wrapped only in a towel, Lonnie speaks into the

            Charlie is 63 years old.  He wears a dress shirt, slacks and
            docksiders.  The suburban father look.

            Off a look from Charlie, Wesley produces a pistol and gently
            nudges the barrel into Del's ear.DEL (CONT'D)Jesus Christ!WESLEYHe's waiting...DELOkay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.WESLEY"Injuns?"CHARLIEYou did not just say "Injuns," Del.DELThe Indians, Injuns, whatever.  They're

            Del slowly takes his shoes and socks off.  He's sweating,
            trembling.CHARLIEI'm gonna talk to you and when I'm
                      finished, you can answer.  But I don't

            Del does it.DELOh, Jesus, please...  Please, God.CHARLIE... and put them in your mouth.

            At a sharp look from Charlie, Del obediently stuffs the socks
            into his mouth and starts to cry.  Wesley produces a roll of
            duct tape and fastens Del's hands to the back of his chair.26     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DEN - NIGHT                        26Betty is glued to the TV, oblivious to the men.  Chloe and

            Del nods again.  Wesley collects Charlie's glass and mixes
            him another drink.  He gets a beer for himself and stands
            behind Del.  Charlie sips his drink slowly, savoring it.

                      mark right across the hairline.

            Wesley produces a long knife and traces a line across the
            very top of Del's forehead.  Trickles of blood wind their way
            down his brow.  Del is MOANING and PANTING through his socks.

            Wesley takes a jab at Del's forehead with his knife, leaving
            a small cut.

            Del starts twitching, rocking back and forth as Wesley grabs
            a fistful of his hair.

            long moment, there is only silence.  An eerie silence.

            Suddenly, Del SCREAMS into his socks and thrashes in his
            seat, blood pouring down his head on all sides.

            Somehow, he manages to get to his feet, the chair still taped
            to him, and begins smashing into whatever is near.  Blood

                      was telling the truth.CHARLIEI saw his soul Wesley.  He was face to
                      face with his God, and no one lies in

                      him whine.  And you didn't take him out,
                      you scalped him.  Christ, I almost puked,

            Ballard pushes Roy out the door. As he returns, Roy reappears
            behind him, leaning in to listen. Ballard doesn't see him.

            Ballard nods, sure he's got a clue here. He looks in at Betty
            again, just as she begins repacking her travel bag.  He
            frowns at this, his suspicions fueled all the more.42     EXT. SUE ANN'S HOUSE - NIGHT                            42A police car pulls up to Sue Ann's house.  Betty gets out,

            Sue Ann looks down at her friend, troubled.  She strokes
            Betty's hair gently and kisses her.  After she leaves, Betty

            "The South Will Rise Again" and a dozen country music tapes.

            Duane gets in the sleeper cab, where stacks of porno tapes

            A telltale piece of Confederate red fabric hangs out of his
            mouth.  There is a purplish bruise on his forehead.  He's
            quiet, but glowering at his captors.CHARLIE... So, at a rest stop outside Logansport
                      you noticed that two guys were slipping
                      something extra in one of your cars, and
                      you decided to see what it was.  Then you
                      figured you'd take this valuable

                      even though it didn't belong to you.  But
                      you needed a crackerjack salesman to move

            just a few spaces away from Betty's LeSabre.

            With a furious calm Wesley wipes his face, then takes out a

            Ellen walks to the end of the bar and starts rinsing glasses.
            After a beat, Betty gets up and moves down close to her.BETTYEllen, this is the biggest thing I've

            Ellen looks into Betty's eyes - sees the innocence, the hope
            and enthusiasm - and has to look away. Betty takes it as her
            cue to leave. She smiles, puts two dollars on the bar near
            the phone and leaves.  Ellen stands perfectly still, watching

            corridor walking away from her.  Betty gives chase.  She
            gains steadily on him, her heart racing.  As they near

            inside: food wrappers, empty bottles, pieces of clothing,
            filthy windows.  They've been living in it.

            Wesley's driving now. Charlie's almost unrecognizable: a six
            day beard, uncombed greasy hair, bloodshot eyes, rumpled
            clothes and an exhausted, faraway look.  The photo of Betty
            faces him, taped to the glove box.  He is reading from the
            diary, which he clutches like the Bible.
            They roar along a desert highway, passing a sign that says
            "Grand Canyon, This Exit.  74 Miles."  Charlie looks up,
            marking his place.CHARLIEWe should go.WESLEYWe don't have time to look at a hole in
                      the ground.  We can make Vegas in four

                      and no Betty.  So what the hell makes you
                      think she's in Vegas?  You think she's
                      waiting for us with tassles on her
                      titties?  Vegas is too crass for Betty.WESLEYI said, 'No.'  N-O.

            Charlie turns to a passage and reads aloud.CHARLIE"When I grow up I'm going to become a
                      nurse or a veterinarian.  I always want

                      Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl
                      to you?WESLEYDo you hear yourself right now...?  Like
                      a fucking madman...

            Wesley drives on stoically.  The Exit comes and goes.CHARLIEEvery American should see the Grand
                      Canyon.  Are you an American?WESLEYYes, I am and we're not going.  Act
                      professional.

            Charlie stares at him, hate rising from just below the
            surface.  He draws a nickel-plated pistol and points it at
            Wesley's head.  Wesley looks at it and keeps on driving.

            Charlie knows this isn't the way to handle it.  He lowers the
            pistol.CHARLIEIf you don't take the next turn for the
                      canyon, I'm blowing my goddamn brains all

            He puts the pistol in his mouth and cocks it.  Wesley looks
            over, not so sure this time.

            LONG SHOT of the black Town Car as the turn signal comes on,
            and it eases onto a lonely dirt road.  Their headlights pick
            out a sign that says: "Grand Canyon Fire Trail.  Forestry

            black Lincoln Town Car pulls up. Headlights glint on the
            chrome, hitting Betty in the eye. She freezes, and Rosa bumps
            into her.ROSASorry.

            Betty stares at the car, unable to remember what it should
            mean.  Then a MAN in a tuxedo gets out.  Betty moves on.111     INT. BEVERLY HILTON - LOBBY - EVENING                  111A sign on an easel reads "Save the Children."  Betty and Rosa
            present their tickets at the door to a ballroom.

            Several times there is a stir near the entrance and a
            scattering of flashbulbs.  Rosa scans the crowd.BETTYLooking for someone?ROSAYou never know who you'll see.

            Rosa keeps looking.  Finally, GEORGE McCORD - the actor who
            plays DAVID RAVELL - enters.

            He comes in with LYLA BRANCH, late 40's, and TWO OTHER MEN.
            Several women approach George, some starry-eyed, for quick,
            polite greetings.  He's doing his job of being a soap star.

            Rosa waits for an opening, then puts her hands on Betty's
            shoulders and points her at George.

                                ROSA (cont'd)
                      Look who's here!

            Betty's jaw drops.  She freezes.

                      You came fifteen hundred miles for this.

            Rosa prods her, then Betty makes her way unsteadily toward
            George.  When she's a few feet away he looks up.

            He can't help but notice her - she's beautiful.  She's also
            looking right into his eyes.  The conversation stops as he
            does a double take in Betty's direction.94.GEORGEDo I know you from...?

            evaporates.  They can handle a fanatical fan.GEORGEThat's very kind of you.BETTYThe day I left you I just drove and

                      and I would have drowned.  But Del jumped
                      in and grabbed me.  We fell out of touch

            Betty wipes her tears away as they flow freely now.  George
            doesn't like seeing her cry; he tries to say something but
            his friends interrupt.GEORGEHey, don't... come on, I was just...

            night.  Ellen drops two coasters in front of Charlie and
            Wesley as they sit down.ELLENWhat can I get you?WESLEYWe're Federal Marshals, ma'am.

            Ellen looks dubiously at their unshaven faces and rumpled
            clothes.CHARLIEWe're looking for this young lady.

            He slides the photo of Betty across the bar. Ellen's gaze
            drops to the picture for a second, and Charlie sees what he
            was looking for - a flicker of recognition.  He allows
            himself a satisfied grin.

            Wesley shows Ellen his badge as Merle checks out the photo.ELLENI haven't seen her.MERLESure you have!  That's ...ELLENShut up, Merle.

            Charlie continues to grin at Ellen ...WESLEYMa'am, if you've seen this woman--MERLEBetty!  That's her name - Betty.

            Charlie takes the photo and puts it back in his pocket.ELLENI never saw that woman before, and
                      neither has Merle.  He drinks too much.

            Wesley steps behind Merle, takes a handful of his hair and
            SLAMS his head into the popcorn machine on the bar.  Merle
            staggers away, stunned. Wesley removes the tin popcorn scoop
            from a nearby hook.

            Ellen reaches for something under the bar, but Charlie's
            faster.  He pins her arm with one hand.CHARLIEYou haven't been very forthcoming with
                      us.

            They watch Wesley follow Merle at a slow walk around the pool
            table, CLOBBERING him over the head about every five steps
            with the popcorn scoop.

            Merle wobbles with every shot, but won't go down.  They begin
            a torturous second lap around the table, punctuated by the
            CLANG of the scoop against Merle's head.CHARLIEWhat's your name, dear?ELLENEllen.CHARLIEThat's a nice name.

            After one more CLANGING shot Merle staggers, then falls.

            until one pantleg is above his cowboy boot. Rosa and Roy
            watch.
            He finally lifts the boot off.  It falls soundlessly onto his
            chest. A small pistol is revealed, holstered above his ankle.
            He works the holster open using the edge of the fishtank.136.Roy and Rosa COUGH LOUDLY at the same time to cover the
            noise. Wesley glares at them.

            Ballard gets the pistol free. But it falls into the fishtank.
            The air goes out of Roy's sails. Ballard has fucked up again.

            glass. Roy can't take it any more. He launches himself at the
            tank, grabs it by the rim and pulls it down on top of

            down upon him.

            Ballard paws through the muck, scattering fish and gravel
            everywhere.  He spots a glint of metal in the sand.

            Wesley struggles out from under Rosa. Just as he gets free,
            Ballard FIRES, hitting him TWICE into his chest. Wesley
            stares in disbelief at the blood rushing out of him.  Then at
            Ballard, as if trying to link the two.
