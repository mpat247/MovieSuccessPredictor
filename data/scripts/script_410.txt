                    "In summer 2001 Iraq sought to
                    purchase 60,000 high alloy 7075-T4
                    aluminum tubes manufactured in
                    China. The high spec of these tubes
                    led us to conclude they were
                    intended for the enrichment of
                    uranium. In August 2001 J.

                    Vienna, to meet with IAEA

                    this report, aspects of which
                    represents the CIA's present
                    position." I'm happy to take
                    questions.ANALYSTThe INR concluded late last year
                    that these tubes were probably for
                    artillery use, and the DOE agreed
                    they exactly matched those used by
                    Iraq for artillery rockets.PAULWhere are the tubes?TURNERWINPAC has them. We've examined
                    them. This is my point. None of you
                    guys has even seen the tubes.VALERIEI've seen them.

                    back samples and delivered them to

          A couple of the analysts try not to smile.TURNERSo I take it you're not a nuclear
                    expert. These tubes are an EXACT
                    match for those developed by German
                    scientist Gernot Zippe in the 50s.
          
          Valerie turns to her notes from her reading.VALERIEYou're right. I'm no nuclear
                    expert. But Dr. Houston Wood, at

                    also knows Dr Zippe, who's 89 and
                    lives in Austria, and he told him
                    that the wall thickness of the
                    Iraqi tubes was three or four times
                    the thickness of his design.PAULAnd the tubes are twice as long as
                    Zippe's design. In fact the only
                    similarity between his tubes and
                    the alumumium tubes is that they're
                    made of aluminium.VALERIEA metal that hasn't been used in

                      sheltering foreigners, Wilson

                      and Wilson evacuated several

                    third-rate CIA agent who had a
                    government salary, and she had sent
                    her husband to Niger, and he had
                    come back and didn't give the
                    report to the CIA, but he turned it
                    over in an op-ed to The New York
                    Times. So she was already in the
                    hot seat with the CIA, and so now
                    she's all about the money. Plus
