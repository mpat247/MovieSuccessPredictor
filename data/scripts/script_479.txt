          Evil came into your life was if you
          invited it. I'm not sure about that, at
          least not anymore. What I cLQ know is
          this: we are born alone, and we die
          alone, and what happens in between is all
          that matters. The choices we make, the
          people whose paths we cross -- these are
          the things that determine our fate.

          Blaze and the pickup are coming on an intercept course.
          Blaze reaches the train first, climbs the gravel incline to
          the tracks. Matches its speed, pulls up alongside a bolted
          container car. He reaches back, pulls the cutters from his
          saddles bags --
          -- and skillfully chops the lock with one hand. The heavy
          iron door slides open, pulled back by it's own inertia.
          Blaze throws the cutters inside, peels away --
          -- and comes back with a vengeance, throttled to the max. He
          jams the front brake on at the last possible moment --
           The bike cartwheels. Tail over head. Pulls a complete three-
          sixty up into the car --INSIDE THE CAR-- and lands perfectly, screeching to a halt. Blaze WHOOPS

          Jed and Murphy stack `em and rack `em. We get glimpses of

          The boxes keep coming, like baggage at the airport. Some
          boxes miss the mark, fall short, get mangled. A box bursts
          against Murphy's chest, engulfs him in an explosion of paper
          and polystyrene beads. The others howl with LAUGHTER, riding

          Jed bangs on the cab roof. Coop waves. Jed and Murphy
          salute. The pickup peels away. Blaze retrieves his bike.
          Stands it back up, kicks it alive, guns the throttle and --
          -- cold jumps straight out of the car. Seconds later he's
          powering away, ripping up a storm, chasing the pickup towards
          the horizon.

          beautiful, easygoing. She's also seven months pregnant.
          The Simpsons are simple, working-class folk. Judging by the
          strained atmosphere, it's evident that they don't care too
          much for Blaze.RITA(TO CHUCK)Hon, would you pass me the vegetables.

          She stomps to the bathroom. Blaze chuckles inwardly. Steals

          She comes around the other side, catches her breath. The
