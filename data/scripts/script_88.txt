    of related news photos.MANETTA (V.O.)1957 was a big year. The Russians
              put that Sputnik into outer space,
              the Dodgers played their last game
              at Ebbets Field, 'that guy' shot
              Frank Costello in the head, and
              missed, and the Gallo brothers
              whacked Albert Anastasia in that
              barber shop in the Park Sheraton
              Hotel. It was total chaos. With
              Anastasia gone, Vito Genovese
              figures he's king shit, but Carlo
              Gambino and 'Joe Bananas' both
              want to be boss of all bosses. So
              they call a meeting -- a big
              meeting.2   EXT. UPSTATE NEW YORK - DAY                                  2CREDITS CONTINUE. In FADED 16mm documentary-style, we
    see a country road winding through rolling hills. At the
    top of the hill, a black '57 Cadillac appears and sweeps
    through the peaceful landscape.MANETTA (V.O.)It was the first time the whole
              commission was ever gonna meet
              face to face. Bosses and wiseguys
              were comin' in from all over the
              country, and all the New York
              families, too -- maybe sixty
              bosses, the whole wiseguy world --
              all headin' toward this little
              town upstate to figure out what's
              what.3   EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY                                          3A sign reads, "Entering Apalachin - pop. 342." The black
    Cadillac speeds past the sign, then another black Caddy,

                 time. Anyway, I don't know what
                 anybody was thinking, but some
                 asshole thought it would be a good
                 idea to have this meeting at Joe
                 Babara's farm in the country where
                 nobody would notice.4   EXT. RURAL GAS STATION - DAY                                  4A local state police deputy is gassing up his motorcycle
    when the parade of shiny black cars rolls by. He looks
    up and scratches his head at the unusual sight.MANETTA (V.O.)Turns out the local cops were
                 watching Joe Babara like a hawk.
                 So now you got about fifty Caddies
                 and Lincolns pullin' into Apalachin
                 and some deputy sheriff with cow
                 shit on his shoes notices all the
                 traffic and calls the Feds.5   EXT. JOE BABARA'S ESTATE - DAY                                5The Caddies and Lincolns are all parked around a rambling

    greeting each other on the big front porch.

     Suddenly they see a John Deere harvester bearing down on
     them.MANETTA (V.O.)Then along comes this farmer who
               almost runs us over in a tractor,
               so your father hauls out his piece,

                  it capo de tutti capi, and that
                  was the last time the whole

                  were going to divide up the whole

                  how we're gonna survive. You got

                  Triads and these crazy Russians to
                  deal with. Everything's changing.
                  We need a leader. Someone with

                  1957, Paul?VITTIYeah, I remember.MANETTAWhen your father died, I promised

     table. Bodyguards follow them to the door. The waiters
     and the owner bow to them as they pass. They are almost
     out the door when Vitti hesitates.VITTIWait a second. I'm just gonna
                  grab a toothpick.

     The instant he steps back inside, Manetta and his
     bodyguard are struck by an incredible VOLLEY of GUNFIRE,
     which BLOWS OUT all the GLASS in the DOOR and WINDOWS.

     Vitti's bodyguard, JELLY, grabs him and throws him behind
     the counter, shielding him with his body.
