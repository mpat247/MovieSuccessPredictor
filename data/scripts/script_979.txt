          They sit on their heels under a sparsely elegant tent, small
          wooden desks with embedded screens in front of them. The
          tent is on a lawn surrounded by lush foliage. People walk
          about and vehicles glide quietly overhead. A utopian vista.GIRLNow that the war's over, our
          soldiers get to come home, yes?TEACHERSome of them. Some will be
          stationed on the rim planets as
          Peace Enforcers.BOYI don't understand. Why were the
          Independents even fighting us?
          Why wouldn't they look to be more
          civilized?TEACHERThat's a good question. Does
          anybody want to open on that?GIRLI hear they're cannibals.ANOTHER BOYThat's only Reavers.ANOTHER GIRLReavers aren't real.ANOTHER BOYFull well they are. They attack
          settlers from space, they kill
          them and wear their skins and rape
          them for hours and hours --TEACHER(in Chinese)(CALMER)It's true that there are...
          dangers on the outer planets. So
          let's follow up on Borodin's
          question. With all the social and
          medical advancements we can bring
          to the Independents, why would
          they fight so hard against us?43.RIVERWe meddle.TEACHERRiver? 
          RIVER is a dark, intense little girl, writing with one hand
          and "typing" with the other. (Typing consists of holding a
          long wooden stylus and tapping either end down different
          columns of chinese characters on her desktop screen.) She is
          a good two years younger than the other kids.RIVERPeople don't like to be meddled
          with. We tell them what to do,
          what to think, don't run don't
          walk we're in their homes and in
          their heads and we haven't the
          right. We're meddlesome.TEACHER(gently taking herSTYLUS)River, we're not telling people
          what to think. We're just trying
          to show them how.
          She violently PLUNGES the stylus into the girl's foreheadINT. LAB - NIGHTAnd we FLASH CUT to the actual present: a 16 year old RIVER
          sitting in a metal chair, needles stuck in her skull (one
          right where the teacher had stuck her) being adjusted by a
          technician. A second monitors her brain patterns.
          The lab is cold, blue, steel. Insidiously clean.2ND TECHNICIANShe's dreaming.FIRST TECHNICIANNightmare?2ND TECHNICIANOff the charts. Scary monsters.DOCTOR MATHIASLet's amp it up. Delcium, eight-
          drop.
          DOCTOR MATHIAS is not instantly likable -- nor gradually, for
          that matter. A cold man, and more than a little satisfied
          with himself.4.Behind him stands a GOVERNMENT INSPECTOR, observing. And
          making him a little nervous.
          The Inspector is in shadow, but his uniform indicates
          -- no
          substantial rank, as does the eagle-crested baton
          longer than a ruler -- that he clutches in one gloved hand.DOCTOR MATHIAS(CONTINUING)See, most of our best work is done
          when they're asleep. We can
          monitor and direct their
          subconscious, implant
          suggestions...
          River starts convulsing, mewing in misery. The Inspector
          starts forward, slowly.DOCTOR MATHIAS(CONTINUING)It's a little startling to see,
          but the results are spectacular.
          Especially in this case. River
          Tam is our star pupil.
          The Inspector steps into the light. He is rigid, cold,
          staring at the girl with no emotion at all. His name, as we
          will very soon learn, is SIMON.SIMONI've heard that.DOCTOR MATHIASShe's a genius. Her mental
          capacity is extraordinary, even
          with the side-effects.SIMONTell me about them.DOCTOR MATHIASWell, obviously, she's unstable...
          the neural stripping gives them
          heightened cognitive reception,
          but it also destabilizes their own
          reality matrix. It manifests as
          borderline schizophrenia... which
          at this point is the price for
          being truly psychic.SIMON(moves toward her)
          What use do we have for a psychic
          if she's insane?J5.DOCTOR MATHIASI don't have to tell you the
          security potential of someone who
          can read minds. And she has lucid
          periods -- we hope to improve upon
          the... I'm sorry, Sir, I have to
          ask if there's some reason for
          this inspection.SIMON(TURNING)Am I making you nervous?DOCTOR MATHIASKey members of Parliament have
          personally observed this subject.
          I was told their support for the
          project was unanimous. The
          demonstration of her power --SIMON(turns back to her)
          How is she physically?DOCTOR MATHIASLike nothing we've seen. All our
          subjects are conditioned for
          combat, but River... she's a
          creature of extraordinary grace.400SIMONYes. She always did love to dance.
          He drops to one knee, slamming his baton to the floor.ANGLE: THE BATONAs the top pops off like a bouncing betty (the grenade),
          flying up over Simon and River's heads and then bursting
          forth in a flat circle of blue energy that bisects the room,
          flowing through the staff's heads and knocking them out.
          Simon rushes to River, gently removes the probes from her
          head and swabs her, whispering:SIMON(CONTINUING)River. Wake up. Please, it's
          Simon. River. It's your brother.
          Wake up...
          She begins to stir as a noise moves him to the door, looking
          out and removing his uniform to reveal an orderly's tunic
          beneath.IWO6.River is suddenly next to him. He jumps a little.RIVERSimon.
          A beat, as they face each other, Simon fighting emotion.RIVER(CONTINUING)They know you've come.INT. GUARD STATION - CONTINUINGAs a guard looks at a monitor. He mostly resembles a secret
          service man -- more bureaucrat than thug. A second man rolls
          into frame on a chair behind him, also watching the screen.INT. RESEARCH CENTER CORRIDOR - CONTINUINGSimon walks River through the corridor. They approach a pair
          of double doors.SIMONWe can't make it to the surface
          from inside.
          Simon turns suddenly as he hears footsteps, people heading at
          them from the other side of the doors.

          But River has, impossibly, scampered up over some lab
          equipment to the dark top of the corridor, where she holds
          herself in a perfect split, feet against the walls and
          outstretched hand holding the sprinkler for support.
          The doors burst open and two doctors pass by, hardly noticing
          the lone orderly. Passing right under River.EXT. VENTILATION SHAFT - MOMENTS LATERIt's small, 15 feet by 15 feet. Goes a long way up and a
          long way down. One wide hinged window looks in on the hall
          inside. Simon and River approach with quiet haste.
          They slip through the window. Simon shuts it, wedges his
          baton into the handle as the SECURITY AGENTS APPROACH. They
          fire at the glass, but their lasers have no effect.
          Wind whips River's hair about as she looks up to see a small
          patch of daylight visible ten stories up. Sees the sky
          blotted out by a small ship that hovers above them.V07.ANGLE: THE SHIP is floating over the grass of rolling hills,
          the city gleaming far beyond. This facility is well hidden.
          A gurney-sized section of the ship's belly detaches and drops
          down ten stories, cables spooling it out of the ship. It
          comes to Simon and River and stops suddenly.SIMONGet on!
          He is standing by the window -- and the Security Agent is
          right behind him, PUNCHING the window with all his might.
          Simon helps River onto the gurney, then jumps on himself as
          the Security Agent cracks the glass. The two are whisked up
          in the gurney, River on her knees, Simon standing beside her
          holding one of the cables --THE OPERATIVE (O.S.)Stop.
          The action freezes.THE OPERATIVE (0.S.)(CONTINUING)Lovely. Lovely. Backtrack.
          The action REVERSES, taking us back to the moment of Simon
          and River on the gurney just before it rises.
          f t oTHE OPERATIVE (O.S.)(CONTINUING)Stop.
          There is a motionless beat, River frozen in that crouch, and
          he steps through what we now see is a hologram of the event.
          The Government's man. We'll just call him THE OPERATIVE.
          He is thoughtful, a little removed. Wire-rimmed glasses, a
          suit too nondescript to be a uniform, too neat to be casual
          wear. He is in:INT. INSTITUTE RECORDS ROOM - DAY-- which is long and bare but for drawers of holographic
          records, a set-up for watching recordings (where the image of
          Simon and River floats), and a table with computer and chair.
          The Operative crosses to the table, looks over some papers.THE OPERATIVEBiograph. Simon Tam.CLOSE ON: THE OPERATIVE'S GLASSESIWO8.As Simon's history files down in print and pictures --

          Doctor Mathias storms in, two security men (not the ones from
          the opening) and a nervous young female intern following.
          Mathias looks greyer and more gaunt than when we saw him last.DOCTOR MATHIASExcuse me! No one is allowed in
          the records room without my
          express permission.THE OPERATIVE(over this, quietly)

          Forgive me. I prefer to see the
          event alone, without bias.
          Mathias looks at the hologram -- realizes which one it is.DOCTOR MATHIASI need to see your clearance.THE OPERATIVEYou're right to insist. I know
          you've had security issues here.
          He places his hand on a screen as he says it. Mathias looks
          at the readout, and drops the bluster.DOCTOR MATHIASApologies. An Operative of the
          Parliament will of course have
          full cooperation.
          (looks at screen)
          I'm not sure what... I see no
          listing of rank, or name.THE OPERATIVEI have neither. Like this
          facility, I don't exist. The
          Parliament calls me in when...
          when they wish they didn't have
          to. Let's talk about the Tams.DOCTOR MATHIASI assume you've scanned the status

          beat the ap-scan, the retinal...
          There was no way I could --THE OPERATIVENo, no. Of course. The boy spent
          his fortune developing the
          contacts to infiltrate this place.DOCTOR MATHIASGave up a brilliant future in.

          deal more dangerous. Have you
          looked at this scan carefully? At
          his face?
          Mathias looks uncertain.THE OPERATIVE(CONTINUING)It's love, in point of fact. He
          loved his sister and he knew she
          was in pain. So he took her
          somewhere safe.DOCTOR MATHIASWhy are you here?THE OPERATIVEI'm here because the situation is
          even less simple than you think.
          (eyeing him)

          Doctor?J10.DOCTOR MATHIASI. I would be very careful about
          what you --THE OPERATIVE(SADLY)It's pride.
          He touches the computer screen and the hologramic image jumps
          to the Doctor and Simon in the lab, Mathias repeating:DOCTOR MATHIASKey members of Parliament have
          personally observed this subject.
          I was told their support --THE OPERATIVE(shutting it off)
          Key members of Parliament. Key.

          more.THE OPERATIVEIt's come to our attention that
          River became much more unstable,
          more... disturbed, after you
          showed her off to Parliament. Did
          she see something very terrible in
          those cards?DOCTOR MATHIASWhatever... secrets she might have
          accidentally gleaned... it's
          probable she doesn't even know she
          knows them. That they're buried
          beneath --THE OPERATIVEBut they are in her. Her mind is
          unquiet. It's the will of the
          Parliament that I kill her. And
          the brother. Because of your sin.J11.THE OPERATIVE(continuing; moving
          to his briefcase)
          You know, in certain older
          civilized cultures, when men
          failed as entirely as you have,
          they would throw themselves on
          their swords.DOCTOR MATHIAS(fed up)
          Well, unfortunately I forgot to
          bring a sword to --
          The air rings crisply as the Operative pulls out his sword.THE OPERATIVEThe Parliament has no further
          interest in psychics. They
          represent a threat to the harmony
          and stability of our Alliance.DOCTOR MATHIASI would put that down right now if
          I were you.THE OPERATIVEWould you be killed in your sleep,
          like an ailing pet? Whatever your
          failings, I believe you deserve
          better than that.
          The agents move. He slices the throat of the one behind him
          with true grace, thrusting at the second as he's pulling out
          his gun and pinning his hand. A moment, and the dying agent
          reflexively squeezes the trigger, shooting his own arm.
          The Operative pulls out the sword and the agent falls as
          quietly as the first.
          Mathias bolts but the Operative pins him to the wall. He
          bunches his fingers and jabs the side of the Doctor's spine.
          Mathias stiffens, suddenly, agonizingly immobile.
          The Operative steps back, observes the Doctor's rigid grimace
          for a moment. Almost ceremoniously, he drops to one knee and
          holds the blade out to one side, hilt to the floor and point
          tilted toward the doctor. The Doctor stares at it in horror
          as his paralyzed body begins to tip over toward it.
          The Operative turns toward the terrified intern at the door.V012.THE OPERATIVE(CONTINUING)Young miss, I'll need all the logs-
          on behavioral modification
          triggers. We'll have to reach out
          to River Tam, and help her to come
          back to us. No matter how far out
          Simon has taken her, we can --
          He's almost startled when the Doctor's body drops into frame,
          slowed suddenly by the sword. It squeaks down the blade, the
          Doctor unable to cry out, as the Operative whispers to him:THE OPERATIVE(CONTINUING)This is a good death. There's no
          shame in this, in a man's death.
          A man who's done fine works.
          We're making a better world. All
          of them, better worlds.
          Mathias is dead. The Operative pulls the sword out as the
          body rolls over. As he wipes the sword down:THE OPERATIVE(CONTINUING)Young miss, I need you to get to
          work now. I think I may have a
          long way to travel.40She goes. He approaches River, very close, staring...THE OPERATIVE(CONTINUING)Where are you hiding,,little girl?

          the same in Chinese behind it.EXT. SPACE, ORBITING THE MOON "LILAC" - DAYWe move away from the ship. The name is on the nose, under
          the bridge. It sticks out from the body of the ship like a
          craning neck. The body is bulbous, with propulsion engines
          on either side and a giant glowing back. There are two small
          shuttles tucked in over the 'wings' of the engines. It's not
          the sleekest ship in the 'verse, to be sure.
          As it hits atmo, the propulsion engines take over and she
          starts to rock a bit, noise filling our ears. Camera comes
          around the front, at the windows and into the bridge, to see
          the Captain, MALCOLM 'MAL' REYNOLDS, standing and watching.
          At that moment, a small piece of the nose breaks off and goes
          flying past the window.INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING[Note: the following sequence will take us through the ship
          in one extended STEADICAM shot.]
          The bridge is small: two pilot seats on either side, and a
          tangle of wires and machinery all about.
          Mal wears the knee-length brown coat and boots of an old
          Independent. Gun at his hip. He's not unlike the ship --
          he's seen a bit of the world and it left him, emotionally at

          much new in design.
          The other tries to tackle Jayne, which is not necessarily a
          great idea. Jayne clotheslines him so hard he spins right

          River looks up at Zoe, alarmed, and silently points to the
          young man. He is slowly reaching for the weapon in his belt.

          He drops his weapon, slides it across the floor.

          off his holster and drops it over a chair. Kicks the toilet
          closed and sits on his bunk.
          The place resembles a submarine cabin, with charts and
          clutter, ancient maps on the walls.J35.Mal moves a bunch of papers off his bunk and a picture slides

          Inara shoots an uncertain look at the camera -- and the
          picture freezes, goes back to the beginning.
          During all this, Mal has picked it up. He looks at it a
          moment, tosses it aside. Looks around at nothing much.JAYNE (V.0.)I do not get it. How's a guy get
          so wrong?INT. CARGO BAY - LATERWe see the doors in the floor slide open, a second set below.
          Pan to see, for a moment, the dead Reaver's face.
          Kaylee is opening the doors with a keypad on a cable. Jayne
          drags the corpse closer to the doors as he continues:R36.JAYNEAin't logical. Cuttin' on his own

          half closed in passion. She settles on a cluster of brocaded
          pillows, and we see another head lowering in for a kiss...
          Come around to see it's another lovely young woman -- and
          that there is a group of ten others watching intently, all in
          saris, on their knees. Two handsome young men with shaved
          heads in the back, also on their knees.
          Inara stops before the kiss, smiling and coming back up. She
          speaks to the girls (We hear only soft music) as she
          repositions the one she's with, lowering again; showing her

          twelve. Years of discipline and

          And the last and these worlds are
          not like the Central Planets.
          There is barbarism dressed up in
          the most civil weeds. Men of the
          highest rank who don't know the
          difference between a Companion and
          a common whore. It's unsafe.SHEYDRAAll the more reason the girls look
          to you. You came out here alone,
          before the Alliance ever thought
          to establish a House this remote.

          affair with a pirate.

          love in a burning temple. I think
          that's my favorite.INARA(SITTING)This is unbearable. Captain
          Reynolds is no pirate; he's a
          petty thief. And he never laid a
          finger on me. All he ever did was
          rent me a shuttle and be very

          blinking light behind it, come THROUGH the wiring of the back
          to look out at the bar, with the word "recording" in the
          corner. Every screen is a camera, even down here.40We pick up Mal and Kaylee heading down into the bar. Cutting
          away from the camera's view, we can looks two stories
          straight down as they go, to a close group of dark tables and
          booths and a second screen playing in the corner.MALIt's not my fault the Doc's got no
          stomach for Rim living --KAYLEEIt is entirely and for all your

          They have reached the guncheck, where Jayne and Wash have
          already checked their guns. It works like a lunch automat:
          Mal sticks his gun in a drawer, pulls out a chit -- the
          q0 drawer closes and rotates, revealing another empty one. A
          large bouncer with a shockrod watches impassively.KAYLEE(as they continueDOWN)Don't you dare joke! You know how

          her and she wrests his shockrod from him, uses it on him, on
          Fanty and Mingo -- the fan-dancer is bolting and River hurls
          the rod at her head, knocks her cold...
          She's everywhere. On tables, chairs, under your legs, using
          the room itself to take out every single person there. One
          man hides behind a wall -- impossibly, she swings her leg
          around the corner and nails his face.
          Jayne grabs her from behind --JAYNE(CONTINUING)Gorrammit, girl, it's me!

          Somebody pulls a gun and she snaps his elbow, causing him to
          scream out even before he shoots himself in the gut --
          Mal frantically wrests a gun from the vending locker as River
          knocks the other guy's gun in the air, kicks someone else and
          then catches it, whips it around just as Mal comes up with

          few incense sticks.
          The room is sparsely lush -- not as opulent as the shuttle
          where she entertained men, but still beautifully furnished
          and draped. A lace curtain hangs in front of the light,
          casting its pattern in shadow over everything. Including the
          rather large figure in a red shawl who kneels beside Inara.MALDear Buddha, please send me a

          Yes, I've read a poem. Try not to

          The Operative moves further into the room. Whenever he
          moves, Mal counters.THE OPERATIVEI've seen your war record. I know
          how you must feel about the

          think you're really just a
          harmless bureaucrat come to help
          me out. You move like a killer.
          The Operative is stopped by this. Unhappily, he continues:THE OPERATIVEI have a warship in deep orbit,
          Captain. We locked on to
          Serenity's pulse beacon the moment
          you hit atmo. I can speak a word
          and send a missile to that exact
          location inside of three minutes.
          Mal pulls a small device, clipped wires sticking out all
          around it, and tosses it to the Operative.MALYou do that, best make peace with
          your dear and fluffy lord.THE OPERATIVEPulse beacon.MALAdvice from an old tracker: you

          you so that you don't waste your
          time: You can't make me angry.INARAOh please. Spend an hour with him.
          Mal smiles -- then glares at Inara, mouthing "Hey!"70.THE OPERATIVEI need her, Captain. River is...
          my purpose and I will gather her
          to me. The brother as well.
          Whatever else happens is
          incidental. In the greater scheme.MALWhy is it that the greater scheme
          always makes everything not that
          great?THE OPERATIVEI want to resolve this like
          civilized men. I'm not
          threatening you. I'm unarmed.MALGreat!
          He draws and shoots the Operative in the chest. The
          Operative goes down as Mal grabs Inara, moves for the-doorway.
          The Operative is on him in a second, choke-hold from behind.THE OPERATIVEI am of course wearing full body
          armor. I'm not a moron.
          He tosses Mal hard against a wall, spinning and blocking a
          blow from Inara -- she is clearly trained in martial arts,
          but he flat-heels her to the ground within seconds.
          Mal is going for his gun again, turning, and the Operative
          kicks him in the face, sends him back, gun flying. Mal gets
          to his feet and they square off. Mal breathing hard, nose
          dripping blood. The Operative perfectly poised, waiting.MALNo back up? We're making an awful
          ruckus...THE OPERATIVEThey'll come when they're needed.MALI'd start whistling.THE OPERATIVECaptain, what do you think is
          going to happen here?
          They come at each other. The Operative is the much better
          trained -- he's fluid, his blows sparse and deadly.4071.Mal is more bluster and determination, and the operative's
          precision is wearing Mal down.
          Mal punches wild -- the Operative counters with a spin-kick
          V0 to the head that sends Mal to the ground not far from Inara,
          breathing hard. He tries to rise again, painfully, but Inara
          places her hand on his arm.
          The Operative goes to his briefcase by the door, pulls out
          his sword. His face has taken on that remote kind of
          fascination as he looks at it.THE OPERATIVE(CONTINUING)Nothing here is what it seems.INARAI know.THE OPERATIVEHe's not the plucky hero. The
          Alliance isn't some evil empire.
          This isn't the grand arena.INARAAnd that's not incense.
          He turns to look: the incense stick burns away -- rather like
          a fuse -- and FLASHES in an explosion of light and sound.40It's a flash-bomb: The Operative sails back as everything
          goes smoky white and the sound dies to a tiny buzz.
          The Operative tries to get his bearings -- and four armored
          soldiers are in his face, asking him for orders... Mal and
          Inara are gone. He motions for the men to follow them.THE OPERATIVEJust a flash bomb. Go! Go!INT. COMPANION TRAINING HOUSE - CONTINUINGInara leads Mal (who is reholstering his gun) down some steps

          I think that I was winning!472.EXT. SIDE OF MOUNTAIN, BY MAL'S SHUTTLE - DAYMal and Inara move quickly down the mountain. They look to
          see that Mal's shuttle has four Alliance guards waiting by
          V0 it. Mal ducks back out of sight, pulls a fancy-looking
          grenade out of his pocket. Pops the top and hurls it over at
          the foursome.
          CLOSE ON: THE GRENADE, as a series of bars of light go out
          one by one, counting down --ALLIANCE SOLDIERGrenade!
          Everybody dives for cover. The moment they do, Mal and Inara
          race into the shuttle, Mal sweeping up the grenade just as
          the last light goes out and nothing happens.

          the solar system, glowing lines connecting all the stars and
          planets. She becomes wide-eyed, breathing hard as it pushes
          in to one system, one planet...

          it too. 'Cause they need to.THE OPERATIVEYou really believe that?MALI do.4112.THE OPERATIVEYou willing to die for that belief?MALV0I am.
          The Operative raises his gun -- but Mal is the quickdraw
          master, shoots the gun out of the Operative's hand and gets
          two hits to the chest (armored) before he makes it to cover.MAL(CONTINUING)Of course, that ain't exactly planA..He drops out his cartridge and slams another in.
          The Operative hides behind some machinery. Tries to peek out
          at Mal -- and more shots send him scrambling back to cover.
          Mal holsters his gun and jumps for the rung above him, starts
          going hand over hand to the island, moving as fast as he can.
          The Operative sees his moment, dives for his gun -- but it's
          been ruined by Mal's shot. He looks over at Mal with death
          in his eyes. He runs at the railing, vaults off it, and
          grabs a chain -- it snaps and he swings, grabbing another.
          He reaches Mal and double kicks him from behind -- Mal flies
          4 off the rung but grabs a chain -- he tries to kick at the
          Operative, but the guy is frikkin' Tarzan, he climbs up and
          pulls a lever releasing one end of Mal's chain -- Mal goes
          swinging, smacks into the wall six feet below the platform.
          He scrambles up just as the Operative swings himself toward
          the platform from above.INT. BLACK ROOM/INNER CORRIDOR - CONTINUINGJayne is still firing continuously as he drags Zoe back to
          the barricades. Simon moves to help -- Kaylee firing now,
          squinting with effort -- and pulls open the cut back of Zoe's
          shirt, checks the wound.SIMONSpine's intact --ZOEJust gimme a bandage.
          Simon pulls a spraycan from his bag, sprays the wound with a
          foam that hardens instantly into an elastic covering.40113.There are a few gun shots (as well as nail-balls and blades)
           from the Reavers. Jayne switches weapons, tossing another to
          Zoe and opening fire --A0JAYNEOh, now you're likin' guns, huh?
          Cheaters!
          He takes a hit in the shoulder, grimaces and keeps firing.
          River watches, the gun limp in her hand. Kaylee grabs it and
          starts another round -- but she's peppered with dart-like
          projectiles. She screams and drops the weapon, pulling the
          projectiles from her -- Inara helps her up, pulls her back as
          Zoe shouts:ZOEEverybody fall back! Fall back!
          Everyone stumbles or is dragged into the inner corridor.
          Inara hits the controls and the doors start to close, from
          each side and above and below. Then, when the hole is maybe
          four by four, they stop.ZOE(CONTINUING)Jayne! Grenade!JAYNEVery last one...
          He tosses it through the hole. Zoe doesn't even flinch from
          the blast as she thinks.ZOEThey're gonna get in --KAYLEECan close it... from outside...ZOENo one's coming back from that...
          She tries to stand, fails.ZOE(CONTINUING)How much ammo do we have?JAYNEWe got three full cartridges and

          He stands, looking around him. His bag is over by Zoe.SIMON(CONTINUING)My bag.
          and SHKOWW!, the bullet takes him in the belly -- everything
          suddenly moving very slowly as he spins slightly, one foot
          lifted, a confused expression on his face -- then speeding
          right back up as he slams down on his back, gasping for air.
          River's mouth opens in a scream she doesn't make.
          Blood spreads from Simon's belly. Inara rushes to him, grabs
          cloth and puts pressure on the wound, puts Simon's hand on it.INARAKeep pressure here...SIMONMy bag. Need... adrenaline... and
          a shot of calaphar for Kaylee...
          I can't... River...?
          She is by his side, takes his hand. She has a kind of
          serenity to her, like she understands something now.SIMON(CONTINUING)River... I'm sorry...RIVERNo. No.
          The lights go out. Everyone looks about them. Jayne fires
          again, but all the sound has bled out save these two.4115.SIMONI hate to... leave...RIVERYou won't. You take care of me,
          Simon. You've always taken care
          of me.
          She stands as the emergency lights come on, giving her face
          an unearthly glow as she looks down at him.RIVER(CONTINUING)My turn.
          She's running so fast, nobody has time to react til she DIVES
          through the hole in the doors, then Simon SCREAMS her name,
          the scream following us back into the Black Room where River
          lands in a perfect roll, comes up in a room full of Reavers.
          Without a moment's hesitation she makes it to the panel, gets
          the doors closing. She dodges a blade, but a blow to,the
          back of the head shakes her. She weaves around a couple of
          Reavers to get to the closing doors, but at the last second
          her ankle is grabbed and pulled out from under her.
          The last thing we see is her being dragged back as they swarm
          over her.
          ANGLE: THE BLAST DOORS, as they shut with a shuddering RLUNG.INT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUINGMal gets up the chain to the platform. The Operative is on
          Mal before he gets his footing, tackles him as Mal's gun goes
          skittering over the edge into oblivion. There is a railing
          here or Mal would go over as well -- but he comes back with
          a couple of hammer blows, gets the Operative off him.
          They square off, Mal stumbling back into a tool chest,
          knocking over tools and computer parts.
          The Operative reaches behind him and pulls his sword
          gracefully from the holster under his jacket.
          Mal produces his weapon: a tiny screwdriver.
          He hurls a toolbox at the Operative and rushes him, gets
          inside sword range and tries for the neck with the
          screwdriver -- the Operative blocks it and works the sword
          point against the edge of Mal's stomach. Starts pushing
          slowly, despite Mal's resistance, and breaks skin.MO116.Mal looks at the Operative a moment -- and the sword slides
          all the way through Mal's belly. Mal's eyes go wide.THE OPERATIVEYou know what your sin is, Malcolm?MAL(shaky smile)
          Aw hell, I'm a fan of all seven.
          He headbutts the Operative viciously, then punches him so
          hard he staggers back, losing his grip on the sword. The
          Operative responds with a spin kick -- Mal holds up the
          screwdriver and the Operative swings his foot right into it,
          gasping as Mal pulls the screwdriver -- and leg it's stuck
          in -- back as he rockets his fist into the Operative's chin.
          The Operative goes down hard, dazed, as Mal grabs the sword
          still in his belly.MAL(CONTINUING)But right now...
          He pulls the sword out, grimacing. Holds it over the
          Operative. The smile gone.MAL(CONTINUING)vao I'm gonna have to go with Wrath.
          He stabs down at his foe's face -- but the Operative rolls
          out of the way, kicks Mal from the ground and is up in a
          second, grabbing Mal's sword hand -- the sword drops -- and
          punching him repeatedly in his stomach wound.INT. INNER HALL - CONTINUINGThe gang is subdued -- because they are all of them injured
          and Simon is slipping away. Jayne looks at Zoe.JAYNEYou suppose he got through? Think
          Mal got the word out?ZOE(almost convincingly)
          He got through. I know he got
          through.VO117.INT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUINGMal goes down hard, spitting up blood. He sees the sword,
          moves -- but the Operative kicks him in the face. Picks him
          lod up, Mal too tired to throw a decent punch.THE OPERATIVEI'm sorry.
          The Operative spins him and DIGS his bunched fingers right
          into the same nerve cluster that he paralyzed Doctor Mathias
          with. Mal goes rigid, his face a rictus of pain.
          The Operative goes near the railing and retrieves his sword.
          Mal trembles, trying to move -- but nothing happens.THE OPERATIVE(CONTINUING)You should know there's no shame
          in this. You've done remarkable
          things. But you're fighting a war
          you've already lost.
          He lunges -- and Mal twists gracefully out of the way,
          grabbing the Operative's swordhand and pulling it forward --
          while driving his elbow into the Operative's neck with
          staggering force.MALIwo Well, I'm known for that.
          The Operative drops the blade, mouth open, stumbling back,
          unable to make a sound.
          Mal spins him, grabbing both his arms and working his own
          through them in a twisted full nelson -- then bringing his
          arms up suddenly, the Operative's mouth going wider as we
          hear his arms crack.
          Mal drops him sitting against the railing, picks up his
          sword, saying:MAL(CONTINUING)Piece a shrapnel tore up that
          nerve cluster my first tour. Had
          it moved.
          He squats down, looks the Operative in the face.VO118.MAL(CONTINUING)Sorry 'bout the throat. Expect
          you'd wanna say your famous last
          MW words now. Just one trouble.
          He reaches over the railing, pulls the back of the
          Operative's jacket through and shoves the sword through the
          fabric, pinning the Operative in his sitting position.MAL(CONTINUING)I ain't gonna kill you.
          He moves to the console, starts prepping it.MAL(CONTINUING)Hell, I'm gonna grant your
          greatest wish.
          He inserts the cylinder, turns it slightly. It hums to life.MAL(CONTINUING)I'm gonna show you a world without
          sin.
          He hits "send all". The cylinder lights up and the broadcast
          V0 begins. Here it is projected as a two-dimensional image on
           the clear plastic partition, right in front of the Operative.
           There are images first of the city -- of bodies, on the
           street, in homes and offices... image after image, jus.t as
           we saw on the research vessel -- and in River's mind.CARON (V.0.)These are some of the first sites
          we scouted on Miranda. There is
          no one living on this planet.

          Mal hits the controls and a ramp extends towards the other
          side. He begins to cross. Never even looks back.

          fury, he is swinging his blade in a frenzy of hate.

          the Reaver clearing frame to reveal:4119.River.

          she uses their own blades against them, throws them, does
          everything in her power to stay one step ahead of -- or
          above -- the mob.
          She slams backwards into a wall opposite the blast doors --
          and a grappling hook punches through it, just missing her.INT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUINGThe Operative watches the end of the broadcast. We are on
          his face through the clear plastic, so the images projected
          on it blur right before him: the Reaver, Dr. Caron -- and her
          screaming doesn't stop til something is shoved in her mouth.INT. INNER HALL - CONTINUINGThe gang is still trying to patch themselves together when
          the elevator doors open. Mal staggers out, holding his
          bleeding side.ZOESir?140 MALIt's done. Report?
          Zoe looks at the badly wounded Simon, is about to give a
          report -- and the doors start to open behind her.
          Everyone turns to look, those who can feebly raising weapons,
          as the square iris of the opening blast doors widens to
          reveal River, standing alone. She is holding two Reaver
          blades, is bloody but unbowed. And the only one alive.
          We hold on her a moment, then the wall behind her is ripped
          completely away.
          Behind it, grappling hooks chained to a huge tractor pull the
          wall away as through the smoke come some fifteen Alliance
          soldiers, who line up, rifles trained on our gang...SOLDIERDrop your weapons! Drop 'em now!ANOTHER SOLDIERDo we engage? Do we engage?4120.Mal and the others tense up. River turns slowly to face the

          a bell than a headstone. It is topped by a jar built'into
          the stone. The jar is weathered tin at top and bottom, but
          glass in the middle. Inside the glass we can see one of
          those slightly moving photos. It is of Mr Universe and his
          lovebot, and the name Mr Universe is carved roughly in the
          stone beneath.
          The camera moves to the right and we see another such stone,
          40 this one bearing the image and inscription: Shepherd Derrial
          Book.
          The third is Hoban Washburne. Wash.
          The camera continues moving right, but the next stone houses
          a small home-made rocket with pieces of paper taped to it
          instead of a picture-jar. And fixing another slip of paper
          to it is River.
          She moves away from the stone as Mal does likewise. They're
          flanked by the crew: Jayne, Inara (to whom Mal moves),
          Simon, who stands holding River before him and hand in hand
          with Kaylee. He has a crutch supporting his other side.
          There is a moment, then they all move aside, saying nothing.
          Between them walks Zoe, in a simple white funeral gown,
          holding a burning taper.
          She stands at the stones a moment, then holds the taper to
          the rocket fuse. Stands back with the others.
          The rocket shoots up into the darkening sky. They all watch
          its sputtering tail a moment, then it it explodes in a series
          of fireworks.40121.WIDE ON the group, as the fireworks go off over their heads.
