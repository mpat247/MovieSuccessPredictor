                                Travis MilloyDEEP SPACEA darkness like no other, a silence that is unsettling.
          Sharp pinholes of light show a sea of distant stars across
          the void of outer space. Our own motion is only realized as
          an enormous object slowly moves towards us, taking shape.
          A SPACE SHIP of unimaginable size, a tubular freighter easily
          ten times larger then any aircraft carrier. At first glance
          it appears lifeless and adrift, but slowly the small glow of
          cockpit windows come into view as we move closer.
          Moonlight cuts across the hull, displaying the name; EDEN.BOWER (V.0.)Where were you... when Eden was lost?
          Like every other kid on my block, I was
          in the middle of a dream, envious of
          those who were chosen to be part of
          mankind's greatest quest. Dreaming of
          the unknown and trying to imagine what
          only the lucky few would encounter.
           We PUSH IN towards the cockpit windows and...DISSOLVE THRU:INT. COCKPIT (EDEN) - CONT.Inside the flight deck it's ghostly vacant, rows of empty
          flight chairs and numerous guidance computers gently
          blinking. With half filled coffee-cups and jackets hung over
          the seat backs... it appears the control deck has been
          suddenly evacuated.
          Muffled SCREAMS are heard somewhere deeper inside the ship.BOWER.(V.0.)As the entire world watched in wonder,
          there were only a few, skeptical of the
          journey's success.(BEAT)Only a few... who would be right.
          The further we move into the ship... signs of violence
          appear, smears of dark blood sharply standing out on the
          bright white paneling and several broken computer screens.
          The muffled SCREAMS grow louder and clearer... an argument
          between men, panicked rage over-lapping.(CONTINUED)2.CONTINUED:CAMERA slowly moves past a corner to see the middle-of a
          violent confrontation. One OFFICER is locked inside a sleep
          chamber, banging on the glass and pleading with panic.
          Another OFFICER is on the floor, mortally wounded, his body
          still twitching with his head bashed in. The INSANE OFFICER,
          a young corporal is moving from terminal to terminal, typing
          in commands with a casual and emotionless nature.
          Blood streams have run down his face from both ears and nose
          as he continues to type commands into the flight computer...
          heightening the trapped OFFICER'S muffled,. screams.TRAPPED OFFICER(IN FRENCH)STOP IT! STOP FOR GOD'S SAKES! PLEASE!GOD NO!The INSANE OFFICER hits the final command key and warning
          buzzers ignite with flashing lights. He closes his eyes,
          taking a breath of relief.TRAPPED OFFCIER(IN FRENCH)STOP IT! YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS WILLDO TO- YOU'RE NOT- STOP! YOU'RE GOINGTO FUCKING KILL US ALL!The trapped OFFICER begins pounding on the glass with a
          crazed panic as the INSANE OFFICER calmly goes to his own
          sleep-pod and climbs inside, sealing the hatch.TRAPPED OFFCIER (CONT-D)(IN FRENCH)PLEASE GOD! NO! NO GOD DAMMIT!Control panels flash and hydraulics ignite. Like a row of
          tumbling dominos, each of the sleep-chamber pods shift
          positions with a SHUSH of hydraulics and then... they are
          launched with a ROAR of micro-jets.CUT TO:EXT. SHIP "EDEN" - CONT.We're suddenly back into the unsettling silence as... like a
          bee hive that's exploded, thousands of coffin-sized sleep
          pods are ejected from the ship in unison. They are sent
          tumbling into open space in every direction as the ship
          slowly continues its unaffected course.(CONTINUED)3.CONTINUED:The trapped OFFICER is seen SCREAMING in silence inside his
          own pod.DISSOLVE TO:EXT. OUTER SPACEWe slowly float towards an astroid field. As we grow closer
          it's the sea of sleep pods slowly floating through space.BOWER (P.O.)Where was I... when I heard we'd lost
          Eden? Just like every other kid on my
          block... I was dreaming... of being one
          who would be chosen to follow.
          As we move closer to the asteroid field of sleep pods, it's
          obvious that time has passed, a single skeleton inside each
          of the pods, hands in a clawing position towards the glass.
          We PUSH IN towards one pod, moving towards the SKULL, still
          locked in a SCREAMING position, wide mouthed and...CUT TO:M. HYPER-SLEEP CHAMBERA RUMBLE passes... EYELIDS TWITCH... A GASP.
          Inside a coffin-size chamber, a dim glow of light seeps
          through a small glass porthole. A MAN is asleep, a mask
          attached to his face, tubes of liquid feeding into his arms.
          CORPORAL BOWER, military physique, chiseled features. His
          chest lightly expanding, blood pulsating through his veins.
          Lights FLICKER PAST and his body comes to life, muscles
          flinching, breath quickening. He squirms with discomfort,
          ripping away the mask. He gasps, trying to SCREAM.CUT TO:INT. SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT - CONT.His scream is muffled under three inches of glass. The hatch
          door is hit with a THUD and white gases erupt from the edges.
          THUD, THUD... THUD! The door bursts open and BOWER scampers
          out, struggling to rip away the feeding tubes. He HITS the
          floor, naked and gasping. His pores ignite, dripping sweat.
          He tries to get to his feet, but his legs wobble underneath
          him, collapsing. He yells at the floor.(CONTINUED)4.CONTINUED:BOWERBurns are red! Bruises... blue-
          His voice echoes into the dark, alone in a cavernous room as
          he pauses, struggling for orientation. He gets to his feet,
          muscles twitching. His short-cropped hair is... pure white.BOWER (CONT'D)Hey...? HEY!!? Someone?
          A constant low RUMBLE is present, joined by the occasional
          MOAN and CREAK of a large ship. A SHUDDER travels through
          the room with a random FLICKER of LIGHTS to reveal...
          A massive steel compartment, tangled with technology. It's
          cold and institutional. High-tech computer terminals slope
          out of the floor. The FLICKER passes, taking us into black.
          We hear him: fumbling through the room, switches are thrown
          with no result and compartments are pulled opened and...
          SNAP! A glow stick comes to life.
          He squints at his darkened surroundings with confusion. A
          drip of liquid catches his eye and he staggers back to his
          sleep pod. He grabs the dangling tubes that were ripped from
          his arm and he sucks on the tube, pulling as much liquid into
          his mouth as possible.
          After a few heavy gulps, he suddenly heaves towards the
          floor. He painfully forces himself to drink, gasping.
          He looks up to notice two sleep chambers next to his own. He
          leans closer with the glow stick to see the first one, the
          name plate reading; 2nd Lt. Cooper. It's EMPTY.
          The third pod's name plate reads; LT. PAYTON. Deep inside
          there is the figure of a man, asleep under a mask.BOWER (CONT'D)Payton? Lieutenant... Payton?
          He turns back to his own pod, seeing the name plate that
          reads; CORPORAL BOWER. Even this name doesn't seem familiar.BOWER (CONT'D)Bower? Bower...?
          The loss of memory heightens his fear even more as a shiver
          travels through his body while he staggers towards a nearby
          computer terminal. He taps the keys on a computer terminal.
          Nothing. He frowns, leaning closer.(CONTINUED)5.CONTINUED: (2)As he taps the keyboard, powder blooms out from under his
          fingers. He wipes the surface of the panel to see a thick
          layer of dust. Under the smear is...
          Elysium - Flight Systems - Operation Terminal #87153-D.
          He pulls focus to see... his FINGERS are trembling
          uncontrollably, an odd vibration of nerves. He slowly makes
          a fist with concern.CUT TO:INT. STORAGE LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATERBOWER walks along a row of storage lockers reading each name
          plate. He stops at the locker labelled; Corp. Bower. He
          pauses, mumbling the name once again with no recognition.BOWERBower.
          He opens the locker to see an assortment of personalized
          belongings, uniform and gear, none of it seeming familiar.
          He uses a towel to wipe off the layer of sweat and oily
          substance coating his body, pausing to see an identification
          tattoo on his forearm that reads: FLT>>005Â»015.
          He pulls on a black flight suit, emblems and military
          markings of rank on the chest. He pulls on shoes and a tool
          belt with a high powered pen-lamp.
          On the inside of the locker is a emergency manual card with
          block figures displaying breathing and stretching exercises,
          labelled; Hyper-Sleep Disorientation Recovery Procedures.BOWER (CONT'D)(reading to himself)
          .in the event of mild memory loss...
          resulting from extended-
          He freezes on... A PHOTO tucked inside the door. EVALON, a
          beautiful young woman smiling towards camera. He stares at
          the-photo, his frown deepening with confusion. He checks the
          back for a name, but nothing. He tucks the photo into a
          pocket and exits.DISSOLVE THRU BLACK:6.INT. SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT - LATERBOWER waves his hand over a sensor... no power. He steps in
          front of a heavy set of steel doors, flipping several
          switches and... nothing.CUT TO:BOWER breaks open a storage bin, pulling out beverage packets
          and a cup, taking a seat at the control desk. With Evalon's
          photograph leaned against the console, he becomes lost in a
          gaze as he gulps down nutrient pills and stirs an instant
          coffee as we...PUSH INThere is a conflict in his eyes, memories trying to return.FLASH CUTAn image FLASHES past, EVALON smiling as BOWER kneels next to
          her, gripping her hands.
          BOWER'S gaze remains hollow, frown deepening as he sips the
          cup and... winces with disgust.BOWERFaa-uck!
          Distant THUMPS. He pans the pen-lamp across the ceiling and
          toward the sounds... PAYTON'S sleep chamber.
          THUMP, THUMP, THUMP: Muffled and desperate. CRACK! Bower
          jumps back as someone kicks their way out from inside, the
          hatch bursting open. Out climbs...
          PAYTON, a man in his forties, but the rugged physique of a
          man half his age, lean and agile. His military-style hair
          cut is also pure white. Gasping for breath, he hits the
          floor as BOWER tries to help him. PAYTON jerks with shock.BOWER (CONT'D)Whoa! Hey... easy! Lt. Payton? You're-
          Sir... whoa!
          PAYTON chokes and gasps, then glances up, giving Bower a once
          over with a frown and a sobering tone.PAYTONWho are you?BOWERBower. Corporal... Bower, sir. I'm the-(CONTINUED)7.CONTINUED :PAYTON(NOT FAMILIAR)Bower?BOWERThat's right. You're waking fromEXTENDED HYPER-SLEEP-PAYTONCorporal?BOWERYes, sir. This is disorientation from-PAYTONcorporal... Bower.BOWERYes. That's right, I'm-PAYTONWanna get that fucking light out of my
          eyes, pal?BOWERSorry... sir.
          PAYTON rubs his face with a frown.PAYTONWhere... are we?BOWERWe're aboard the Elysium. From what I'veGATHERED-PAYTON(NOT FAMILIAR)Elysium...? Where are we?BOWERI don't... really know. There's no power
          in the com and I can't even-PAYTONWhere's the... rest of the crew? It's
          our shift? Our rotation-BOWERI believe so.(CONTINUED)B.CONTINUED: (2)PAYTONAren't they suppose to be here... to wake
          us?BOWERSir... I don't know where anyone is.
          PAYTON takes breaths, trying to regain his senses, glancing
          around at their darkened surroundings.PAYTONHit the lights, will ya?BOWERAh... we're having some power problems-PAYTONWho woke you up?BOWERUmm, not sure. It had to have been the
          flight computer. There's no one here...
          (off his look)
          .except us.PAYTONCold in here.
          BOWER grabs him a towel and water container, turning back to
          see PAYTON doesn't waste any time, stretching his limbs.BOWERThere's no power coming off the main
          grid. Can't fire any of the...
          (searching for word)
          Dynos. Can't even open the doors.
          PAYTON glances to the other empty sleep-chamber with a frown.BOWER (CONT'D)(off his look)
          Our 2nd Lieutenant? I don't know where
          he is. It was empty when I woke up.
          None of the systems are on-line.
          Mainframe is down, so I don't know how or
          why it engaged independently-PAYTONBower .BOWERYeah?(CONTINUED)9.CONTINUED: (3)PAYTONUntil I have two coffees you're just
          gonna have to repeat all this shit, so
          let's just idle here for a bit.BOWERSorry. I just- Just glad to see you
          awake. i was... a little concerned. I
          didn't know what to do if-
          PAYTON gets to his feet, stumbling. BOWER catches him under
          the arm as they stagger into the wall.BOWER (CONT`D)Easy... Lieutenant. Easy.PAYTONCoffee?BOWERI'm on it.PAYTONGood man.
          BOWER helps him to the locker room as LIGHTS FLICKER past.CUT TO:INT. STORAGE LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATERPAYTON staggers along the row of storage lockers as BOWER
          helps guide him with the flashlight beam. PAYTON pauses with
          a frown as he glances across the name-plates, none of them
          seeming familiar. BOWER gestures toward the locker, the name-
          plate reads: LT. PAYTON.BOWERThis is you, sir.PAYTONHow do you know that?BOWER1 It's... the name on your sleep pod, sir.
          PAYTON opens the door to see his belongings inside, a photo
          of WIFE (MARIANNE) inside the door. He stares at it with
          utter confusion. BOWER takes this in, looking to the memory
          recovery card inside the locker.(CONTINUED)10.CONTINUED:BOWER (CONT'D)it says that the memory loss is only
          suppose to be a momentary loss that's-PAYTONVery reassuring. I guess when you gamma
          the brain into extended REM, sometimes it
          can take a while to get it back.
          PAYTON pulls on his flight uniform and squeezes his feet into
          his shoes. BOWER notices the identification tattoo on his
          forearm, partially obscured from view;
          FLT>>00... (obscured by grime, hair and angle). Unlike his
          own, PAYTON'S tattoo is faded with age.BOWERI've been awake for at least an hour and
          I still can't remember my... anything.PAYTONListen, the last time I crawled out of a
          hyper bunk, it took me... quite a while
          to get it all back.
          BOWER holds his frown as PAYTON squeezes his finger into a
          wedding ring.BOWERWhat was... your last flight, sir?PAYTON(BEAT)Don't recall. The Kuiper Belt odyssey?
          Don't worry, it'll come back, eventually.
          PAYTON kisses the photo of his wife.PAYTON (CONT'D)I've gone through this before. I just
          can't remember why I would agree to do it
          again.
          PAYTON goes to close his locker and BOWER motions with a
          serious tone.BOWERSir? I know this is going to sound
          strange, but do you even know where we're
          going? I can remember the training,
          but... not the mission. Know the
          procedures, not the... destination.(CONTINUED)11.CONTINUED: (2)PAYTONI figured you'd tell me.BOWERDidn't even know the ship's name until I
          saw it-on the console. For all I know
          this was another damn training exercise-PAYTONTrust me, it's not. if this is a
          simulation...
          PAYTON notices both of their reflections off the mirrored
          panel inside the locker... revealing their WHITE HAIR.PAYTON (CONT'D)Someone is taking the joke a little far.
          He shuts the locker and they exit, the flashlight's beam
          panning away, taking us into darkness.CUT TO:INT. SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT/CONTROL DESK - LATERBOWER and PAYTON are standing at the control console, the
          screens flickering with distortion. BOWER hands him a coffee
          and PAYTON takes a sip... with a wince of disgust.BOWERNone of the activators are working.PAYTONFigures. We can ride two hundred
          thousand tons of space freighter across
          the galaxy without a dent in the hood,
          but can't get one good cup of coffee.
          PAYTON flips a few switches with no result of power.BOWERWithout the mainframe, we can't connect.
          I don't know how we'll ever be able to-
          PAYTON is in his element at the control desk, flipping open
          an emergency auxiliary-power panel. He snaps open a handle
          and he forcefully gives it several rotations with a MOAN of
          whirling magnetos. The hand-crank allows a dim glow of
          electricity to the light panels.BOWER (CONT'D)Oh, I- didn't even think of that.(CONTINUED)12.CONTINUED:PAYTON gives him a look with a grin and flips a switch.PAYTONPayton on the con. Respond? This is Lt.
          Payton of flight Team...? Shit-BOWERFive.PAYTONFive? How do you know that?
          BOWER pulls up his sleeve, exposing his tattoo ID. PAYTON
          nods, "good thinking."PAYTON (CONT-D)Lt. Payton of Flight Team Five. Does
          anyone copy? Anyone... respond? Anyone
          awake up there?
          Dead static.BOWERTeam Four suppose to be here for the
          shift rotation. Where could they be?PAYTONFucking teamsters. Maybe they couldn't
          get to us.
          BOWER eyes the third empty sleep-chamber.BOWERWhere could he have gone?
          PAYTON gazes off blankly. A RUMBLE of FLICKERING LIGHTS pass
          and the computer screens slowly fade, going black.PAYTONThe power systems must be free-floating
          off blown circuits or something. The
          over-ride grid won't even lock in.BOWERWhatta ya think?PAYTONI think we need to find a deck of cards
          and call the union.
          Distant THUMPS are heard overhead and they freeze... watching
          the ceiling with uncertainty.(CONTINUED)13.CONTINUED: (2)BOWERSomebody... is up there.PAYTONHmm. Ventilation... maybe. Systems keep
          re-booting after each surge. That could
          be anything.
          THUMPS fade as the ship eerily MOANS and CREAKS.PAYTON (CONT'D)I say we get out of here. I'd rather be
          up and out then stuck in the trunk.
          The room is blocked by the two heavy steel doors on either
          end, security doors ten feet wide. PAYTON leads the way
          towards one end, gesturing towards the doors.PAYTON (CONT'D)We're not far from the bridge but without
          the circuits locked in... I don't know
          how we could ever get this thing open.
          As they approach, their flashlight beams pan across the door
          to see jagged chips and scratches all along the edges. Tools
          are scattered on the floor, the control panel ripped open.BOWERJesus. Somebody was trying to get out.PAYTONIronic. I think it was built to protect
          us.BOWER(gesturing to the third pod)
          Well, he got out... some how.
          A RUMBLE approaches... another SHUDDER that FLICKERS the
          lights. They watch the ceiling as BOWER counts in his head
          as it fades.BOWER (CONT'D)Cycle is broken.IPAYTONWhat?BOWERIt's not circuitry. Reactor timing is
          off-set in the core. Seems sporadic, but
          it's not. Each revolution decreasing
          before starting over from the beginning.(MORE)(CONTINUED)14.CONTINUED: (3)BOWER (CONT'D)It's trying to reconnect, but it won't
          until it's reset.PAYTONHow the hell do you know that?BOWERI dunno. I can't remember my own- but I
          know everything there is to know about
          that damn reactor.PAYTONThe training stuck.BOWERAnd I know that...
          Another SHUDDER approaches.BOWER (CONT'D)That's twelve revolutions, before
          recycling. And this one will only last-
          As they watch the ceiling, their flashlight beams stop on a
          small ventilation shaft that's been ripped open. They
          exchange a look and...CUT TO:INT. VENTILATION SHAFT - MOMENTS LATERTheir lights spill inside an endless steel shaft only a foot
          and a half in diameter, leading into darkness.PAYTONNow if we only had a monkey and a rope.
          PAYTON climbs down as BOWER rotates his jaw with eagerness.BOWEROur 2nd Lieutenant must have gone this
          way. Don't you think?PAYTONMust have.BOWERIt's the only way out.PAYTONI think we're better off... waiting here-BOWERFor what? If the mainframe is off-line-(CONTINUED)15.CONTINUED :PAYTONWe're not going to be able to get to the
          bridge or even be able to open that door
          from the other side-BOWERBut we can at least find out what'sHAPPENED-PAYTONDo you remember just how big this ship
          is, kid? We don't know where that will
          come out, if at all-BOWERBut, we can at least try to-PAYTON(SOBERLY)I can't do that.BOWERCan't do... Sir?PAYTONListen, I have to take a handful of
          Doxitol just to get in the hyper-bunk.BOWERYou're... claustrophobic?PAYTONI can take a lot, that's not one of 'em.BOWER(BOLDLY)I can take it.PAYTON(SIGH)Real boy scout, is that it? You get lost

          toward HEFLIN, completely unaffected by the threat. He
          squeezes the trigger and...

          Another lever is turned and... F00000SH! A stream of vapor
          shoots out of several vents along the wall. The colorless

          escape, but TANAKA runs up the wall, diving and grabbing onto

          erupts with a horrific SCREECH, HISSING at them before
          turning and leaping back up and over the rafters,

          of black water, sent tumbling.CUT TO:123.INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK - CONT.The tremendous ROAR of rushing water rolls them down the
          stairwell and into the sleep chamber compartment in a raging
          torrent, a tidal wave slams into the wall.
          BOWER grabs onto NADIA and they claw themselves along the
          wall as computer terminals SPARK and LIGHTS go black. He
          pulls her to a sleep-chamber and he jumps inside the open
          hatch, pulling her with.NADIANO!? Are you crazy-BOWERGET IN!He pulls her inside and turns to the control panel. He hits
          the keypad to read: >>> DETACHMENT INITIATED >>>
          BOWER struggles to close the hatch as water rushes in,
          SLAMMING it shut on top of them.
          GALLO struggles to keep his head above water as the fast
          moving current SLAMS him into the edge of the doorway. His
          I fingers claw at the manual lever for the door, tugging and
          tugging with no effect as the water rises above his head.CUT TO:INT. SLEEP CHAMBERBOWER and NADIA are squeezed together inside the pod as water
          quickly rises above the porthole.NADIA(GASPING)Not like this! I can't- like this!BOWERHold on!
          Under the roar of the rushing water, hydraulics ignite.
          Micro-jets FIRE and WHOOSH! The pod launches, shooting down
          a tunnel until they're HIT with a tremendous JOLT.
          They are sent spinning into a wild tumble as bubbles and gas
          erupt across the outer surface. BOWER and NADIA slam into
          one another as the chamber turns end over end.
          Its roll seems to slow for a brief moment and BOWER squints
          toward the porthole to see...(CONTINUED)124.CONTINUED:POVThey are pulling away from the side of the ship. The
          exterior hull of the massive space ship slides past at a high
          rate of speed with a swirl of ocean water and bubbles.
          BAM! The pod SLAMS into something as SPARKS fly and seals
          are ruptured as WATER sprays in with a blinding BLAST. The
          chamber is sent into another violent roll as NADIA and BOWER
          tumble head over feet, as if caught within a washing machine.
          The chamber finally steadies as water washes across the
          control panel, one last burst of sparks knocks out the
          lights, taking them into BLACK.
          Only their gasps are heard as they squirm towards the upper
          corner... only a foot of air remaining.
          He grabs the mask connected to tubes in the side and pulls
          the straps over her head.NADIAI What are you doing!?BOWER1 Put it on!NADIANo! I can't- Not like this! I'm not
          going to wake up and drowned-BOWERPUT IT ON!He pulls it over her face as the water rises with only
          several inches of air inside the chamber. BOWER gasps
          desperately into the corner.
          NADIA gasps the air through the mask, making her eye-lids
          droop, slowly going unconscious. BOWER gasps one last breath
          and the water rises over his head.
          BOWER watches her body go limp and squirms for air as... a
          warm GLOW of WHITE LIGHT grows brighter through the porthole.
          As sunlight dances through the porthole, he kicks at the
          hatch and...CUT TO:125.EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - DAYBOWER kicks open the hatch, gasping for breath. A gentle
          breeze ripples across the water with a sunlight flickering
          across the surface of an ocean.
          He pulls NADIA out of the chamber, ripping the mask off her
          face. Her eye-lids slowly begin to flicker back to
          consciousness.BOWERHey...? Hey?
          She chokes on the air and struggles to orientate herself,
          looking up to see him gazing down at her, coated with bright
          sunlight.NADIA(GASPING)Where are we? What happened?BOWER(GRIN)It's all right. It's safe to wake up

          within the ocean waves. They're just off shore from a
          stretch of mountainous tropical islands with waves crashing
          against the beaches. The unusual shape of the islands and
          their geography are nothing like we've ever seen on Earth.
          Several moons dot the sky and the sun is rising with a
          brilliant glow on the horizon.FADE TO BLACK:INT. COMMAND DECKPitch black. A low CHURNING is heard, a motor that is
          pumping as the water lowers, allowing us to see across the
          dishevelled command platform, the walls dripping with water.
          The water is being drained through the grates in the floor as

          from the ordeal. He examines the empty tank where BOWER'S
          sleep chamber once sat. He eyes the other sleep-chambers,
          deeply contemplating.
          He goes back to the control console, scanning across the
          numerous surveillance monitors that reveal...
          PASSENGERS and HUNTERS engaged in a variety of activities all
          across the ship. Some are seen fighting, some searching for
          food, some searching for a way out, some alone weeping. A
          kingdom, for the taking.
          He pulls out a coffee packet and slowly begins mixing himself
          a cup, deeply contemplating as he looks across the screens.
          He glances over to see... YOUNG GALLO, the younger version of
          himself, who is seated nearby, watching with a grin. The
          blood is gone from his face, appearing clean-cut, clean
