   figure money, tall, Northern Italian women and minor German
   princesses with Swiss educations, no bimbos and no questions
   about asset origins.  The exception is "Born to Win's"
   sponsor, a blonde, dreadlocked, bearded 6'4" SWITEK.  He

   no one's found them yet.)  Meanwhile...CUT TO:INT. ALONZO STEVENS' HOUSE - A KITCHEN - NIGHTA couple-hundred-thousand-dollars worth of granite and steel.
