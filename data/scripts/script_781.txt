     somewhere in Harlem.                                                

     A man runs for his life in the deserted space. He's an African      
     American male in his forties wearing a security guard uniform.      

     He turns into an empty corridor, climbs a set of stairs towards     
     the exit, but- The gates are down and the station is closed.        

     Desperate and out of breath, he is forced to trace his way back,    
     searching for an exit or a place to hide. He sees a door to the     
     public restroom and runs inside.1B   INT. NIGHT - SUBWAY PUBLIC RESTROOM                            1BThe place is deserted as well. One of the mirrors is smashed        
     while the others are covered by graffiti and dirt -                 

     The neon lights are flickering, bringing the place in and out of    
     the dark.                                                           

     The man checks each stall one at a time.                            

     His face lights up as he looks inside the last one-A SMALL WINDOW ABOVE THE TOILET IS JUST BIG ENOUGH FOR HIM TOCRAWL THROUGH.He steps onto the toilet seat but the window is shut too tight.     
     After a brief struggle, he swings it open, only to discover-        

     A wall of bricks.                                                   

     Panic returns to his eyes. He slowly opens the stall door,          
     fearful of what could be waiting outside.                           

     A FAINT SOUND OF SHATTERING GLASS is heard.                         

     He quickly shuts the door, holding his breath. Frozen.              

     Silence.                                                            

     His heart racing, he exits the stall in the direction of the        
     sound. The place is empty.                                          

     The room is revealed by flashes of flickering neon lights.          

     He moves closer to the sinks and the spiderweb cracked mirror.      
     His image is fragmented and deformed. It resembles a Cubist         
     portrait.(CONTINUED)2.1B   CONTINUED:                                                       1BMANI'm sorry... I... I... I wasn't trying

     He approaches and starts crying like a child. His head resting        
     against the mirror, he pleads for his life. Then, seeing the          
     dirt and grime on the mirror, his behaving shifts to another          
     extreme. He starts cleaning it frantically with his hands. Too        
     frantically-                                                          

     A piece of the spiderweb cracked mirror falls on the ground.          

     Immediately, he bends down to pick it up but-HIS REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR REMAINS STANDING IN SILENCE,WATCHING HIM.Looking up, the man realizes his reflection has become                
     independent. A separate being...                                      

     Terrified, he slowly stands staring at his stationary double.         

     The pointy and sharp piece of broken mirror in his hand reflects      
     the neon lights just like a knife blade.

     It's 8 a.m. The blinking digital numbers of the alarm clock
     reflect off the wooden floor of the apartment.                        

     The sunlight is diffused through the drawn curtains of the

     Seen in the reflection of the TV-set, a man is sleeping on the

     The shower turns off. A hand reaches out to wipe away the mist        
     on the mirror above the sink, revealing-                              

     The face of BEN CARSON, 41 years old. His eyes reflect the

     to shut down-

     The damage from the fire is still noticeable on the facade of
     the building-

     The fire appears to have started on the ground floor and seems
     to have spread all the way up to the top. Some of the windows
     are shattered, while others are boarded up. What was once an
     impressive ornate building, a fine example of 1920's
     architecture standing on one of Manhattan's most dynamic
     streets, now gives off a feeling of devastation and desolation.

     What is left of it is a mere ruin, a sort of neglected ghost
     ship, abandoned in the heart of the city.9.14   INT. DAY - MAYFLOWER                                          14The last beams of daylight shine through the broken windowpanes.

     Inside the department store, everything has remained the same
     since the fire, as if time stood still. The display cases, the
     departments, the mannequins, and even the clothes are all burnt
     or blackened by the fire. A thick coat of soot covers the floor
     and rainwater drips down all over the place.MAN (O.S.)It's been five years and they're still

                is impossible...                                        

     In his dark brown uniform, the daytime security guard, LORENZO     
     SAPELLI, 60's, seems pleased to guide Ben through what was once
     a temple of beauty and vanity.LORENZOYou know, the Meredith family acquired                  
                this building after St. John's                          
                Hospital closed in 1952. It was the                     
                very first Mayflower to open on the

     On the cracked walls, THE HUGE 1920 MIRRORS that have survived     
     the flames reflect merely the remnants of the past. The
     customers are long gone and have been replaced by pigeons flying
     in and out of the gaps in the roof.LORENZO (CONT'D)The company wants us to patrol the                      
                premises every couple of hours, but I

     Ben follows Lorenzo through the burnt display counters. He         
     listens but his mind has drifted elsewhere. This place makes him
     uncomfortable. It's not only the lingering smell of a fire, but
     also a sense of death that hangs over it.                          

     The whistling of the wind through the store's old ventilation

                  the mirrors in their house. Some say
                  that it's just to renounce all vanity
                  during the mourning period, but others
                  say something else... They say it's to
                  keep the soul of the dead from being
                  trapped in the mirrors... Believe it

     facing his reflection in the mirror.

     He fixes his collar and looks at himself in his new clothes- Not
     quite an NYPD uniform...

     mirror and leans forward-A HANDPRINT, BARELY VISIBLE, ON THE ICE COLD SURFACE.He touches it with the tip of his fingers and tries to rub it
     off, unsuccessfully. He picks up a rag from the ground, spits on
     the mirror, and rubs the mark fervently. The print remains. This
     confirms his hunch-THE HANDPRINT IS INSIDE THE MIRROR...By angling the flashlight, another handprint is revealed.

     his reflection reaching for the handle of an invisible door!

     Slightly annoyed, the little boy places the eyes on the snowman.

     of her father's car approaching-DAISYDaddy!

     Michael turns around and sees Ben exiting his 1986 Oldsmobile,           
     with a big wrapped package in his arms.

He finds
     some instant coffee next to the bottle of Jack Daniels. He
     briefly hesitates between the coffee and the whisky...              

     He grabs a cup and pours the boiling water into the instant

     for his rounds.45   INT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER CENTRAL HALL                            45Through the shattered panes of the central dome, we see Ben
     walking through the store.

     Since the mysterious occurrences of the night before, his
     attitude has changed. He avoids, as much as possible, looking
     into the mirrors. He is on guard, fearing another supernatural
     manifestation.

     The shadows, the mannequins, and the shapes in the mirrors are
     all disturbing and unsettling.

     Even what remains of the sculptures on the top of the marble        
     columns seems alive in the dark.                                    

     As he crosses the entrance hall, a glint of light catches his
     attention. Despite himself, he stops and gazes into the mirror-AT THE FAR END OF THE STORE, ONE OF THE DEPARTMENTS IS IN FULLSWING AND BATHED IN DAYLIGHT! EVERYTHING IS SPOTLESS, AS IF THEFIRE HAD NEVER TAKEN PLACE. CUSTOMERS COME AND GO AS IF NOTHINGHAPPENED.How is this possible? Ben turns around to see the same spot in
     the real world- ONLY IT'S IN RUINS...                               

     Ben glances back at the reflection in the mirror-

     The vision of the past prevails. Unable to ignore it, Ben
     decides to check it out for himself...

     Ben wanders off towards the far end of the store, a landscape of
     dust and desolation. HIS REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR, ON THE OTHERHAND, HEADS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE "FLASHBACK"-We follow him in the mirror-

     Ben has left the night behind and enters the "daytime"
     department. Everything is in perfect order and unspoiled.

     Ben continues his journey into the past.(CONTINUED)24.45   CONTINUED:                                                       45The customers jostle one another while shopping during a big

     Ben stops dead in his tracks when he notices, around his shoes,
     a transparent liquid spilling out on the floor-

     He bends down and dips his fingertips into the liquid- GASOLINE.
     Gallons of flowing gasoline gradually spreading over the floor
     of the department store.

     Ben turns around and sees, under the shelving, A HAND LIGHTING AZIPPO-The lighter falls to the floor in slow motion.

     The liquid bursts into flame instantly. THE CHEERFUL VISION OF ADAY IN THE DEPARTMENT STORE QUICKLY TURNS INTO A NIGHTMARE-EVERYTHING IS ENGULFED IN FLAMES. THE CLOTHES, THE MANNEQUINSAND LAST BUT NOT LEAST, THE CROWD! THE AGONIZING SHRIEKS OF PAINAND PANIC ARE DEAFENING.Frightened, Ben steps back-

     rushed to escape death-HORRIFIC VISIONS OF PEOPLE BURNING ALIVE... INCINERATED FLESH.FACES DISTORTED BY THE PAIN, SKIN MELTING TO THE BONE.In the midst of the flames through the heat waves, Ben spots the      
     face of the firestarter- IS IT HIS OWN?                               

     Ben has no time to react. In a split second, his uniform catches
     fire.

     Ben catches his breath, trying to come to his senses. What's
     happening to him? What he just experienced certainly felt real.

     During his panic, the flashlight rolled under one of the
     counters.

     Ben bends down to pick it up. The beam illuminates the ground
     and throws light on an object a bit further away- A LEATHERWALLET.(CONTINUED)25.45    CONTINUED: (2)                                                   45He stretches out his hand to pick it up. The leather is worn-out
      but the absence of dust establishes that the wallet has landed
      there recently. Ben examines the object with the experienced
      touch of a professional accustomed to handling evidence.

      Between the collection of cards and scraps of paper, Ben finds a
      driver's license belonging to- GARY LEWIS, 55 years old, a
      sturdily built African American man. WE RECOGNIZE THE MAN

      the shoulder-AGAIN THE SAME NAME: GARY LEWIS, BEN'S PREDECESSOR, THE MISSINGNIGHT WATCHMAN.The wallet rests on the table and piques Ben's curiosity. He
      cannot hold back his police instincts.

     In the basement, the water level continues to rise.

     With a flashlight in hand, and his feet submerged in the water,
     Ben moves deeper into the tunnel.

     He is searching for the source of the leak. The beam of light
     sweeps across the walls and the piping.

     Ben crosses an intersection. In the corner, on the tiled wall,
     he barely discerns an old inscription ingrained with decades of
     dust and dirt. He sinks his hand into the water and wipes it
     off, revealing an arrow pointing to, ST JOHN'S DEPARTMENT OFPSYCHIATRY.He continues his exploration of the subterranean passageways.

     Suddenly, he notices a darker area on the wall. He comes closer
     and discovers a brownish damp-spot, covered with mold. The
     humidity has pearled into droplets.

     He has found the source of the leak.

     His hand brushes the wall, causing it to crumble instantly. Ben
     digs into the plaster as if it were butter, bringing a cracked
     water pipe to light. The leakage has damaged the wall in which
     the tubing was embedded.

     Ben hears the echoing sound of streaming water, as if there were
     another room on the other side of the wall.

     He pushes against the saturated wall, and pierces through it

     gaping black hole that he has just left behind.

     Ben peeks through the hole with his flashlight, but he cannot
     make out what is on the other side.

     He makes the hole bigger, until the passage is large enough for

     guard's uniform.

     From where he stands, Ben can only see the back of the man's

     embroidered on the man's shoulder-IT'S GARY LEWIS, THE FORMER NIGHT WATCHMAN!BENGary?

     Ben's Oldsmobile pulls over in the street- He has decided to
     pass by Gary Lewis' old house before his nightshift.

     He presses the doorbell next to Gary Lewis' name. An old lady
     answers-BENMrs. Lewis... Sorry to bother you... My
                name is Ben Carson. I worked with

     thick glasses. She lives alone in the small apartment that she
     used to share with her grandson.

     We sense that she is distraught by Gary's death.MRS. LEWIS...My Gary hadn't slept at home for
                three weeks. At first I figured he had
                found himself a girlfriend, so I
                didn't worry much about it... It's
                terrible. The policeman told me that
                he was living in the streets... They                     
                found his body in the subway. Why? He
                had everything he needed here. Every

                  anymore. Before, we'd sit up and watch

     She sets down the picture frame.BENMay I see his room?MRS. LEWISYes, of course. Come, follow me, it's
                down the hallway, the door at the very
                end.

     Ben follows Mrs. Lewis to her grandson's room-

     It looks nothing like the room of a fifty-year-old man, but
     rather like that of an old teenager. From what we can see, Gary
     grew up in here, and each object recalls a stage in his life.
     Everything is clean and in its proper place, it is perfectly
     tidy.BENDo you mind if I stay in here for a
                moment?

     Mrs. Lewis smiles at him. She too, likes to gather her thoughts
     in Gary's room.

     Ben scrutinizes the room in search of a clue, a hint that might
     help him on the Esseker lead. He opens the drawers and looks
     through the papers-

     Nothing is of any help to him. The only place left that he
     hasn't searched is the walk-in closet, whose half-open doors
     seem to invite him to enter...

     What Ben discovers inside is beyond anything he could ever have
     imagined- The closet has been emptied out completely, andMIRRORS COVER EACH AND EVERY WALL, FROM THE FLOOR TO THECEILING! - It's a miniature replica of the hidden room that Ben

      We move down each floor to the entrance hall. The basement door
      is open and, in the darkness, we see the gleam of the
      flashlight. Ben must be down there.

      ALL OF A SUDDEN, A LOUD SHRIEK TEARS THROUGH THE SILENCE. There
      is a woman, somewhere in the store.

      Ben runs up to the entrance hall at full speed. The shrieks
      resound through the department store again. They seem to come
      from one of the floors above.

      Without hesitation, Ben dashes up the stairs-

      He arrives on the second floor and searches through all the
      departments. Impossible to tell where the cries originate from.

      He climbs up to the third floor. The beam of the flashlight
      sweeps past each nook and dark corner-

      Somewhere in the store, the woman continues to scream and wail
      to death.BEN(shouting)WHERE ARE YOU?!!No answer. Ben goes up to the fourth floor. The shrieks are
      heard again, but this time, coming from one of the floors below.

      Short of breath, Ben inspects the dressing rooms with his
      flashlight.

      The woman seems to have vanished.BEN (CONT'D)Ma'am? I'm right he...

      ANOTHER SHRIEK IS EMITTED, RIGHT NEXT TO HIM. He turns around-

      No one there.

      About to leave the dressing rooms, Ben catches sight of a
      mirror. In the reflection he sees the row of empty rooms-A BLOODY HAND BURSTS OUT FROM THE LAST ONE, ACCOMPANIED BYANOTHER PIERCING SCREECH OF PAIN!Ben runs to it, but finds it empty. IN THE REFLECTION OF THEMIRROR, HOWEVER, THE HAND IS STILL STRETCHED OUT TOWARDS HIM!Ben stops to think- If he can somehow move the mirror to have it
      face the last booth, he might be able to see what truly happened
      inside.

      Ben unhooks the mirror.

      It is way too heavy and bulky to carry. He lets it slide down
      the wall.

      Inch by inch, Ben hauls the mirror across the floor.

      He reaches the last dressing room-

      Through the reflection in the mirror, he examines the interior
      of the cubicle.

      In the dark he catches sight of BARE FEET STAMPING AGAINST THE
      TILED FLOOR. The torn, half-burnt curtains conceal the rest of
      the body...

      With his eyes fixed on the mirror, Ben walks backward towards
      the dressing room. He is scared of what he is about to discover.

     Not a single shard of glass, not even a scratch, the mirrors

     On the wall, he is assembling all the newspaper clippings,
     articles and photographs that Gary sent him.

     Ben hangs up the phone and remains in front of the wall covered
     with clippings for a moment. Now he can have a clear overview of
     Gary's investigative research.

     All the articles date back approximately to the same period and
     are all related to the fire that ravaged Mayflower five years
     ago.

     But not a hint of Esseker.

     Ben studies the newspaper clippings, trying to piece the story
     together-

     death of his wife and three daughters. "

     Ben observes Terrence Berry's face in one of the archive
     photographs. He looks like a perfectly normal guy, rather kind,
     surely he was a good father... Ben can't help but empathize with

      His shoes sink into the mud. He walks up the steps of the porch

      At the last minute, she turns her head to gasp for air.

      The remaining water swirls down the drain. The bathtub is now       
      empty and the invisible force seems to have vanished.

      Amy collapses to the ground, spitting and coughing. She comes to
      her senses, gets back to her feet and dashes out of the
      bathroom.AMYMichael?! Michael?

      As she runs past the bedroom, she notices that the door is open-AMY (CONT'D)Daisy !?

      Daisy is no longer there.AMY (CONT'D)Daisy !

      Panicked, Amy crosses the corridor and barges into the
      children's room. Inside she discovers-115   INT. NIGHT - CHILDREN'S ROOM                                  115SUSPENDED IN THE AIR, A FEW INCHES OFF THE GROUND, DAISYSTRUGGLES TO BREAK FREE.In the mirror, Amy sees her own reflection bringing the sharp
      blade of the scissors to her daughter's throat. The blade glides    
      over her skin.

      In reality, A TRICKLE OF BLOOD APPEARS ON DAISY'S THROAT.

      Instinctively, Amy throws herself against Daisy, tearing her
      away from the grip of her own reflection. They land on the floor    
      and crawl to the corner of the room, safe from the danger of the
      reflections.

      Amy tears off a piece of her clothing, which she presses against
      Daisy's throat in order to stop the bleeding.AMYOh my god, don't move baby, don't

      Fortunately, Daisy's wound is not deep. The blade did not reach
      the main artery. Amy saved her life at the very last minute.

      Daisy is half conscious from the loss of blood. She struggles to
      speak-DAISYWhy did you do this, Mom?AMY(in tears)

      A bit further away, in the scraped section of the mirror, we
      can see Amy's reflection, on its knees above Daisy who lies on     
      the floor-

      As she passes the bureau, she grabs the first-aid-kit from one
      of the drawers. She sets her daughter down in the walk-in           
      closet, away from the mirrors. The little girl has trouble
      moving.

      Amy examines the cut on Daisy's throat. Quickly, with a
      professional touch, she disinfects and bandages the wound.AMYListen to me carefully Daisy... I want
                 you to stay in here and be quiet.

      Daisy is terrified and with her remaining strength, she holds on

      seems to provide her an intense pleasure...

      "Anna" froths at the mouth. Her speech has become a deep,
      animalistic, incomprehensible gurgle.

      In an effortless movement, "Anna" pushes him away.

      Her demonic strength is ten times his. Ben is merely a puppet, a
      rag doll that she sends flying into the air, only to crash
      violently against the brick walls...

      Blood squirts onto the surface of the water.

      Ben smashes into the wall separating the mirror room from the
      underground passageways.

      On the other side, he lands on the ground, in the dark. He         
      strives to regain consciousness...

      Ben takes advantage of the brief respite to pull out his gun but- 

      "Anna" appears from the dark and, in a flash, she strikes a
      backhanded blow that sends the gun off into the air.

      She lifts Ben up and throws him across the room. He rams into
      the wall.

      With the absence of light in the basement, Ben is defenseless.     
      He cannot see his assailant...

      Ben is caught by the leg and dragged backwards. His hand           
      struggles to catch on to anything that could hold him back.

      Suddenly, under the water, his hand lands on the gun. He grabs
      it, turns onto his back, and fires point-blank at "Anna".

      The bullets go flying through her body, but they don't stop her.(CONTINUED)100.129   CONTINUED: (2)                                               129Ben is being dragged. He manages to grab hold of one pipe after       
      the other, trying to hold on, but the pipe gives way and breaks
      off from the wall, LETTING OUT A POWERFUL JET OF GAS.

      Once again, Ben is sent flying down the tunnel.

      He struggles to get back on his feet-                                 

      Apart from the sound of the flowing gas, a disturbing silence
      surrounds the subterranean passageways.

      Ben makes out "Anna's" silhouette, hiding behind the leaking gas      
      pipe.                                                                 

      With his bloodied face, Ben is no longer the same man anymore-        
      Something in his eyes has shifted. Rage and violence have             
      replaced the terror and dread. He is determined to put an end to      
      the creature, no matter what happens.                                 

      He slides the weapon in his belt and steps, with his bare hands,      
      towards what once was "Anna"...                                       

      Crouched over in the water, the demon looks up, ready to charge.      
      Ben takes another step forward with the same determination. The       
      creature thrusts itself against him-                                  

      THE CLASH IS EXTREMELY VIOLENT. Ben uses all his strength to          
      keep his assailant's jaw at a distance.                               

      In a swift movement, Ben turns around AND IMPALES "ANNA" ON THEBROKEN GAS PIPE!IN A GUSH OF BLOOD THE SHARP METAL TIP PIERCES THROUGH HERSTOMACH BUT-Despite being momentarily immobilised, the demon seems                
      unaffected by the near total destruction of its outer shell. On       
      the contrary, it struggles more violently to escape from the          
      trap.                                                                 

      Ben moves away, keeping an eye on "Anna". He takes his gun and        
      aims it at her. Ben is exhausted. With his arm outstretched, he       
      is ready to shoot, waiting for the right moment.                      

      The silhouette suddenly emerges from the dark.                        

      Ben stands by-

      Totally burnt, flesh charred, "Anna" is enraged by her prey's
      resistance. The blazing demon runs after Ben.

      Behind them, one after the other, sections of the walls
      collapse.

      Ben runs as fast as he can.
