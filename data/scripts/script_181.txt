                           Tom Butterworth and Jez ButterworthFADE IN:In a Russian summer meadow, a young girl spins around and 
               around. A simple guitar theme plays as the low sun catches 
               her hair. Around her neck is a pair of field binoculars, and 
               she runs through the meadow with them pressed to her face, 
               spying butterflies, birds, rabbits. She reaches the top of a 
               hillock, and jumps into the air, and flies up into the sky. 
               We float up and up with her as she aims the binoculars up, 
               up, into the sun.FADE THROUGH SUN TO:An aerial shot of the rolling English countryside. Nothing 
               but fields and trees for miles. The shot describes a panorama 
               before looking directly down, at the earth, and we begin to 
               move.

               We fly low over a field, a ditch and straight out over six 
               lanes of motorway. Cars and lorries tear below at a hundred 
               miles an hour. We fly over the hard shoulder to another field 
               beyond.

               We descend on two young boys in the field. A pornographic 
               magazine is spread out of the flattened grass. One of the 
               boys puts a match to the centre page and as the flames lick 
               up, we begin to move again, across the field, over a path 
               and into a suburban garden.

               We fly over five or six gardens, over a barbecue, over 
               children splashing in a pool, over a woman sunbathing, a man 
               mowing his lawn, a young boy bouncing up and down on a garden 
               trampoline, to arrive on the patio of John Buckingham. He 
               walks out onto the patio, where he sits in a chair, facing 
               his house, setting down a mug of tea.CUT TO:A blurred face sharpening into focus, John Buckingham, about 
               thirty-two, sitting on his patio, his garden behind, fields 
               beyond.JOHNHello.

               His hand adjusts a microphone on his lapel.JOHNHello, hello. Hello...

               He shifts in his chair. Coughs. He looks straight at us.JOHNI don't believe in perfect love. You 
                         know, love that comes out of the sky 
                         like a thunderbolt and uh... This is 
                         ridiculous.

               He removes the microphone. He sits there, thinking very hard.JOHNNo. No no no. Nope.

               He stands, turns and stretches.BLACKOUT:FADE UP:He is sitting as before, looking at us.JOHNRunning. Reading. Going out. Staying 
                         in. The countryside. Films, if they're 
                         good.BLACKOUT:FADE UP:JOHNThoughtful. Outgoing. Ambitious. 
                         Well-read. Reasonably popular.

                         Pretty I suppose. But its not

               from the back of a van.JOHN (V.O.)Someone with a sense of humour. 
                         Someone you can communicate with on 
                         the same level. Someone you can really 
                         talk to. I think communication is 
                         key.INT. BEDROOM - DAYJohn's hands smooth a crisp white sheet over the double 
               mattress. An ant runs across the sheet. John squashes it and 
               picks it carefully off.JOHN (V.O.)I think that by the time most people 
                         turn thirty they know where they're 
                         going.CUT TO:EXT. GARDEN - DAYJohn encircles his house, leaving a thick trail of yellow 
               powder behind him.JOHN (V.O.)And where they've been. I suppose 
                         they have some baggage stroke history.EXT. THE GARDEN RECORDING - DAYWe see that John is talking to his PC. It has a small digital 
               camera on the side.JOHNWe all have someone in our past who 
                         uh... one skeleton, if you like. 
                         We've all got at least one person, 
                         as it were, under the patio. Not 
                         literally of course. I suppose I 
                         only say this because I always thought 
                         people who did this sort of thing 
                         were... I had an image that they 
                         were losers. Not losers. A bit sad. 
                         But I think this is the modern world. 
                         And I think really it's quite a brave 
                         move. Quite a brave, reasonable thing 
                         to do.

               He smiles.JOHNSorry can we start again?SINGLE CARD ON BLACK:BIRTHDAY GIRLJohn's fingers in close-up, type JOHN BUCKINGHAM, and his 
               AMEX number into his PC. Finished, he stops, and rests his 
               face on his hands.

               He hits SEND. That instant, a worry of black crows bursts up 
               in the field behind him and takes to the swirling air.

               Blackout. Music. Titles.

               The titles pop and slide over footage of Russian women, on 
               computer video, advertising themselves. They mostly speak in 
               Russian, some of which is subtitled, some speak in English. 
               The women slide on and off the screen, overlap and collide, 
               as the titles appear. Close-ups on mouths and eyes, tight 
               and pixellated. It becomes a wall of image and sound.CUT TO:EXT. SKY - DAYThe GIGANTIC UNDERSIDE of a Boeing 747 TEARS down the screen.INT. AIRPORT TRAVELATOR - DAYJohn slides across the screen, motionless, towards Arrivals.INT. AIRPORT - DAY.Last calls for flights leaving for the other side of the

               the mirror. He looks okay, a little white.INT. ARRIVALS GATE - DAYThe Arrivals gate slides open and passengers flood through. 
               John stands among the chauffeurs and cab drivers, as the 
               passengers trundle by.

               We follow one young woman long enough to think this must be 
               her, but it's a false alarm, she's lifted up and spun around 
               by someone else.

               They've all passed. That's that. She wasn't on the flight.

               John wanders away from the gate. He stands about in the swirl 
               in the middle of the airport. People bustle by. Everyone 
               going somewhere.

               Gradually, we get the sense we are being watched. A woman 
               stands nearby. She is about twenty, very beautiful, tired 
               and laden with luggage.JOHNNadia?

               She nods.JOHNI'm John.

               They shake hands.JOHNWelcome.

                         Well. Look I didn't have a speech 
                         but...

               A distorted passenger announcement breaks above us. It's too 
               loud to talk. It ends and they stand there in silence. He 
               points to her luggage.JOHNIs that everything?NADIAYes.JOHNRight. Okay. Good.

               They stand there.INT. AIRPORT LIFT - DAYNadia and John stand side by side in a huge lift.JOHNWe can talk in the car.

               A deafening roll of thunder.EXT. AIRPORT CAR PARK - DAYIt's pouring with rain as they cross the car park towards a 
               patched up yellow Rover. John stows the suitcase in the boot 
               and opens the passenger door for her.INT. / EXT. JOHN'S CAR (MOVING) - DAYJohn turns the key in the ignition. The MG wheezes and coughs. 
               He tries again. Nothing. The third time it just catches and 
               he coaxes it to life. The colour's drained from his cheeks.

               They head for the motorway. The silence in the car lasts 
               just long enough for John to feel he is breaking it.JOHNIt's about forty miles from here. I 
                         don't know if you've looked at a 
                         map, it's close to London but it's a 
                         city in itself. A Roman city. It's a 
                         nice house. I'm having a problem 
                         with ants. I uh... It's the warmer 
                         weather. I can't seem to find the 
                         nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"?NADIAYes.JOHNI just can't find a nest. The root 
                         of the problem. I've looked 
                         everywhere. What's the Russian for 
                         ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. 
                         This is strange isn't it.NADIAYes.JOHNI'm pretty nervous. Are you?NADIAYes.JOHNI mean... "Ants." "I've got a problem 
                         with ants."

               He shakes his head.JOHNI had this...

               He pulls a sign from his jacket which says "Nadia!"JOHNAs a joke but uh...

               He tosses it onto the back seat.

               They drive. He sees Nadia looking at England.JOHNSo. Is it different to how you 
                         imagined it?NADIAYes.JOHNI bet.
                              (pause)
                         What about me? Am I how you imagined?NADIAYes.

               He double-takes, changes lanes.JOHNAnd how was the flight. Sorry, am I 
                         speaking too fast for you?NADIAYes.

               John looks across.JOHNDo uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? 
                         Do you understand what I'm saying?NADIAYes.JOHNGood. Or should I speak slower?NADIAYes.JOHNDo you follow or should I speak 
                         slower?NADIAYes.

               He looks across. Back at the road. He changes gear.JOHNUh... Are you a giraffe?NADIAYes.

               John turns to face the road ahead.JOHN(to himself)
                         Oh Jesus.

               He drives in silence.JOHNOh Jesus.

               Suddenly she winds the window down and vomits out of the 
               speeding car. John panics and swerves onto the hard shoulder 
               amidst loud horn blasts.EXT. HARD SHOULDER - DAYJohn navigates his way round the Rover in the rain to find 
               her kneeling on the verge, throwing up. He puts a hand on 
               her shoulder, but she stands up quickly, maintaining an icy 
               dignity considering what has just happened.EXT. JOHN'S CLOSE - DAYIt has stopped raining and a group of young boys are playing 
               cricket in the road. They clear as a Yellow Rover pulls into 
               the Close, and into the drive of the little house at the 
               end.

               As John climbs out of his car he eyes the boys. The boys eye 
               him, and his new friend.INT. JOHN'S HOUSE - DAYThe front door closes behind them. John and Nadia stand in 
               the silence of his hallway. There is a small banner hanging 
               there: "Welcome Nadia". They study the banner together, 
               gravely.

               Eventually he opens a door.JOHN(quietly)
                         Lounge.

               She peers round him and looks inside. He leads her down 
               towards the kitchen.JOHNKitchen.

               She glances around it. Then back at John. He nods to himself, 
               looking tense and pale.INT. JOHN'S UPSTAIRS LANDING - DAYHe puts her suitcase down on the landing, and opens a door. 
               Without looking inside:JOHNBathroom.

               He closes it.INT. MAIN BEDROOM - DAYStanding in the doorway of John's bedroom.JOHNBedroom.

               There it is. The Double Bed. John frowns gravely.

               Without warning, he marches out. She comes out onto the 
               landing to catch John plus suitcase kicking open another 
               door and vanishing inside.INT. SPARE BEDROOM - DAYNadia peers around the door to find John standing next to a 
               narrow monk-like single bed.JOHNThe uh... the other bedroom...

               She looks at it, then up at John. She turns and walks out.

               Now she's back, with her camouflaged hold-all, dumps it onto 
               the floor, heaves the suitcase onto the bed and smoking no-
               hands, starts unpacking. John plugs in the lamp by the bed. 
               To show Nadia how it works he switches it on, off, on, off, 
               and then feels stupid.JOHNI'll get an ashtray.

               With John gone, Nadia stops unpacking. She walks to the window 
               and stares out over the rooftops of the estate.CUT TO:INT. LOUNGE - DAYJohn on the phone.ANSWER MACHINEYou have reached From Russia with

                         urgently. There's a critical problem. 
                         It's... Call me back as soon as 
                         possible. It's critical.INT. STAIRS / LANDING - DAYJohn climbs the stairs holding a saucer for an ashtray. He 
               knocks lightly on the spare room door.INT. SPARE ROOM / LANDING - DAYNadia is lying asleep on the bed in only her black underwear. 
               We duck straight back out.

               John composes himself. He puts his head back round the door 
               as if there's a real chance it will be shot off. She's facing 
               away, arms folded, still holding the cigarette. It has burnt 
               out, leaving a long curl of ash on her bare hip.

               He approaches the bed with immense trepidation, eases the 
               cigarette from between her fingers and drops it in the bin. 
               He stares at her bare hip, with the ash on it. Holding the 
               saucer under the ash, he blows on it gently. It takes three 
               careful breaths before it drops in the saucer. Unseen by 
               John, her eyes are wide open as he steals out onto the 
               landing. We stay with her a moment.CUT TO:A pot of stew, bubbling on the hob.INT. KITCHEN - DAYJohn is stirring a pot on the hob. By his expression he might 
               be defusing a bomb.

               His head cocks, he stiffens. Nadia walks right into the 
               kitchen. She's changed, jeans and a tee shirt. Nadia takes 
               the spoon from him, says something in Russian, gestures for 
               him to sit.

               She tastes the stew. Now she stirs the pot. He watches her.CUT TO:INT. KITCHEN - DAYJohn and Nadia sit opposite each other. She takes a mouthful. 
               They catch one another's eye. And again.

               On the wall across, six ants careen in crazy circles. John 
               can see them, but doesn't move.

               He puts his fork down.JOHNI don't know what to say. Your letters 
                         were in English. Good English. You 
                         said you'd studied English.

               Nadia reaches down into her bag and pulls out a small box 
               wrapped in brown paper. She places it in front of him.

               He warily unwraps a little wooden box. He opens the lid and 
               fishes out a simple gold ring. He holds it in his palm.JOHNI can't take this.

               He puts it back in the box, hoping it will disappear.

               She fishes it out again and holds it on her palm for him to 
               take.JOHNI can't take it. I'm not really a 
                         ring guy.

               She takes his hand. He automatically yanks it away like he's 
               been burned. She takes his hand again and to stop it becoming 
               unbearable, he allows Nadia to push the ring onto his ring 
               finger. It goes on easily.JOHNOkay. No big deal. Thank you. Yes 
                         thanks. Thank you.INT. LOUNGE - NIGHTJohn and Nadia sit next to each other on the couch watching 
               T.V. John's gaze seems to go through the T.V. and a thousand 
               yards beyond. Nadia is knitting a half-finished jumper, blood 
               red.

               John stands and disappears out of shot.JOHN (O.S.)If anyone gets this message please 
                         call as soon as possible. It's an 
                         emergency.

               John sits back down. He steals side-glances at her. Her mouth. 
               Her red-painted fingers knitting fast.

               John flips through the channels --

               Eventually he offers Nadia the remote control. She takes, 
               aims it at the T.V. but doesn't press it. Just as it seems 
               she won't, she does: University Challenge.

               They watch University Challenge with Nadia still aiming the

               ask him if he's staying for another.

               A knitting needle is drawn from a row of red stitches on the 
               nearly-finished jumper.

               She studies her book. Looks up.NADIAToday is bath day.

               He shakes his head.JOHNBath day?

               She lights a cigarette from the butt of her last. Blows smoke. 
               She holds the jumper up to John, as if to try it for size, 
               and the theme returns.INT. KITCHEN - DAYJohn is on the telephone.JOHN...It might just be a twenty-four

               passing trees.

               The roof is down. We glide up the windscreen, up Nadia's 
               body, in the passenger seat. Her face is upturned slightly, 
               she's wearing sunglasses, which reflect the passing trees.INT. JOHN'S LOUNGE - NIGHTNadia sits alone at the dining room table. Suddenly the lights 
               go out. John enters, carrying a small birthday cake glowing 
               with candles.

               The light throws huge shadows on the walls and flickers across 
               their faces.

               He sets the cake down on the table and sits down opposite 
               NadiaJOHNHappy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday 
                         to you. Happy Birthday dear Nadia...

               The front doorbell rings. A loud long burst. Nadia's face 
               transforms into a big grin. She hurries out into the hall, 
               leaving John alone with the cake. Nadia whooping and shouting 
               excitedly. Other voices. Shouting. Shouting in Russian.

               A man bursts in carrying Nadia in his arms. He spins her 
               round in the candlelight, kisses her, puts her down and goes 
               to the table where he blows out the candles. They are plunged 
               into darkness.

               Lots of whooping and laughing. A Zippo flares up and 
               illuminates some faces, all laughing.CUT TO:John's hand groping along the wall. It finds the light switch.

               There are two men here. One small and wiry, one big and dark, 
               like Rasputin. They each carry rucksacks and a guitar case.YURIYou must be John. You seem very nice. 
                         Excuse me.

               In Russian, the first man introduces Nadia to the other man, 
               who is relighting the candles with a Zippo. It seems they 
               haven't met before.

               The first man, Yuri, pulls out a bottle of vodka and hands 
               it to John.YURIHow's that? We can't drink our piss

               Yuri stops.YURISorry. You've lost me...JOHNI'm asking what you're here for.YURIWhat?

               Yuri speaks to Nadia in fast Russian.YURI(to John)

                         This explains your cold eyes.

               Nadia begins gabbling to Yuri in Russian. Yuri says the 
               English word -- "Friends".NADIA(to John)

               Nadia talks fast to Yuri.YURIShe says she wanted to tell you but

               Alexei turns off the light again. Nadia blows out her candles. 
               They are plunged back into darkness. John turns the light on 
               again. Yuri is already sitting down.JOHNI need to know who you are first 
                         please.YURIOh.

                         Russia can I cut a long story short. 
                         Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. 
                         Except she's not. But we say cousin.

               He hands John another bottle of vodka.JOHNHold on.YURIToast first then we talk seriously, 
                         I can see you are serious about us.

               Vodka is splashed into their glasses. Yuri raises his glass 
               and shouts a toast in Russian: "Vashe Zdarovye!". They down 
               their vodka, John sips at his, then realises he must finish 
               it. Yuri makes as if to throw his in the fireplace.YURIJust kidding.

               Sausages, cheese, bread and pickle bottles rain onto the

                         Chicken and the birthday here we 
                         are.

               Yuri speaks to Nadia in Russian, she replies looking at John.JOHNWhat was that?YURII asked her if you were happy to see 
                         us. I find it hard to tell with you.JOHNYes it's okay. Thank you for the 
                         food.

               Nadia lights a cigarette. John notices that on both wrists 
               she has bold red marks from the ties. He freezes.YURIShe says you are a little shy. I 
                         think I know this.

               John is thrown, panicking that one of them will notice the 
               marks.JOHNSo how long will you be in England?YURIPlans are for the architects,

               Yuri laughs, translates for Alexei and they both get a big 
               laugh out of this. Yuri gets his passport out and makes a 
               big show of presenting it to John. But John keeps glancing 
               at the marks on Nadia's wrists. We see a close up of her 
               neck. There is the tiniest blood mark. John sees it and starts 
               to sweat.YURIWe are all Europeans here. Europe, 
                         Tony Blair and Maggie Thatcher!

               Yuri raises his glass and they all drink to Tony Blair and 
               Margaret Thatcher. John drinks his vodka in two hot gulps.YURISo. You have nothing to say to your 
                         Fiancee? Maybe to wife of forty years 
                         it's understandable. Come on. You 
                         speak and I will translate.

               John looks glazed. The room falls silent.JOHNHello.

               Yuri translates -- She replies.YURIShe says 'Hello' to you. Go for it

               They all wait. Yuri nods encouragingly.JOHNI can't think of anything. Hang on.

               Nadia speaks in Russian to Yuri.YURIShe says she has a secret to tell.JOHNWhat?

               Nadia speaks. John waits uncomfortably. Silence.YURIShe says she watched you at the

                         would take a picture.

               With the binoculars pressed to her face, she spies 
               butterflies, birds, a rabbit. She stops running and aims the 
               binoculars up, up, into the sunINT. JOHN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHTYuri translates.YURIThe day before I left Russia my father 
                         gave me the old binoculars. He said

               Nadia looks at the table.YURIShe says she took a picture.

               John watches Nadia looking at the table. She glances up once 
               and catches his eye.

               Alexei suddenly slams his hand down on the table. He raises 
               his palm. There is an ant squashed there. He shows Yuri.ALEXEINasyekski.EXT. JOHN'S GARDEN - NIGHTThe small party has moved outside to the patio, where they

               beautifully on his guitar.

               Yuri offers John the glass. He looks at Nadia, takes it and 
               swigs it down in one. He looks across at Nadia, wiping his 
               mouth, his eyes watering. She looks back at him.

               Alexei begins softly singing a song. As he sings:YURIThis is a love song, a soldier's 
                         song to his beloved -- Alexei, he's 
                         Afghanstya, a veteran of Afghanistan. 
                         He saw terrible things.

               They listen to the beautiful, sad voice. For the second verse 
               Yuri joins in, a slow stirring lament. For the end Nadia 
               joins in too and the three of them begin harmonising 
               beautifully. John watches in the candlelight.

               John, Nadia and Alexei pose with the cake. Nadia puts her 
               arm round John and Alexei. With a FLASH! Yuri takes a 
               Polaroid.

               The guitar theme returns as we see the Polaroid on the table 
               in close up, developing speeded up. John comes into focus,

               together, in the moonlight. Nadia whispers something in her 
               sleep, in Russian. Fast asleep John mutters something in 
               English. Their sleeping, unintelligible conversation, drifts 
               on in the night.INT. BANK - DAYJohn sits at his desk in the open plan office. He looks 
               nervous.

               This is because he is wearing Nadia's ring. People pass his 
               desk, a couple say hello, but they don't notice. He rubs his 
               chin. Nobody notices.

               before...INT. KITCHEN - DAYHe opens the fridge and pours himself a glass of orange. He 
               stops -- There on the draining board lies the bloody skin of 
               a rabbit. John jumps out of his skin.

               Next to the rabbit skin is a hand-drawn map. A dotted line 
               winds around the map and ends with an X in a small wood.

               He looks at the rabbit skin, with its eyeless sockets.EXT. FOREST - DAYJohn follows a path through a big silent wood, the low sun 
               flaring and catching his white work shirt.P.O.V. OF JOHNthrough binoculars, a long way off and squinting into the 
               sun.

               Nadia lowers the binoculars and looks past us.CUT TO:John spots some figures lying on the grass in the distance. 
               He heads towards them, and watches them for a moment from 
               thirty yards away.

               Alexei, Yuri and Nadia sit in a small clearing. A blanket, 
               cushions, bread and vodka are scattered around. Yuri is 
               strumming a guitar. Alexei and Nadia are laughing and 
               chatting. He removes a small twig from her hair and flattens 
               it under his big hand. John watches the gesture. It's so 
               intimate they could be lovers.YURI(calls)
                         John. We can see you hiding.

               John steps out of his hiding place and approaches the group. 
               Alexei has Nadia falling about laughing about something. He 
               smiles at her then nods to John.

               Pieces of cooked rabbit lie in tin foil. Alexei feeds a piece 
               to Nadia with a big hunting knife. Nadia smiles at John, and 
               starts knitting.YURIHow is bank?JOHNFine. I thought you were leaving 
                         today.YURITo be indoors on such a day. It's 
                         crime.

               Nadia stops knitting and takes her shirt off and stretches 
               back to sunbathe in her black bra. Alexei takes the knife he 
               has just finished cleaning and holds the cold wide blade 
               flat above Nadia's bare stomach. Just before pressing it 
               down he looks across at John. Nadia yelps and sits up. They 
               laugh, and Yuri joins in. John laughs uneasily.

               Alexei notices marks on Nadia's midriff. He asks her about 
               them in Russian.

               John goes white, unable to understand Nadia's explanation. 
               He has no idea what she told him.EXT. LAKE IN FOREST - DAYAt sunset, the four run towards a lake in their underwear. 
               They jump and dive in, and begin splashing each other.

               John duck-dives under the water and swims through the sunlit 
               streaked green water. We see him under the water, swimming 
               towards us, caught by the sun's rays.

               John surfaces, and wipes the water from his eyes. He spots 
               Alexei and Nadia playing in the water. Alexei grabs her and 
               throws her in the air and she comes down with a splash.

               John treads water nearby. He watches them both hold their 
               noses and disappear under the surface.

               They've both vanished. John ducks under the water.

               John's underwater P.O.V.: It's too murky to see anything.

               The two surface, breathing hard, laughing. John watches them.

               Alexei holds Nadia tight and looks like he might even kiss 
               her. But instead he ducks her and holds her under the water.

               John treads water nearby. She's been under a long time.JOHNHey.

               John begins to swim toward Alexei. Just as he gets near, 
               Alexei lets Nadia surface, coughing and spluttering -- she 
               shouts at Alexei in Russian, angry.

               Alexei makes for her again but she pushes him away, twice, 
               almost slapping him. She is very uncomfortable. She swims 
               away.

               Yuri admonishes his friend in Russian. Alexei stares at John, 
               then swims off powerfully back towards the shore.YURIHe's just having fun. He's maybe too 
                         strong you know...

               John watches Nadia walk out of the lake towards her clothes.INT. BEDROOM - NIGHTJohn walks into his bedroom. Nadia is on the bed with a

               is already asleep. John lies back in the moonlight, and stares 
               at the ceiling.EXT. GARDEN - DAYA light summer rain. Drips fall from rose petals.INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - DAYJohn opens his eyes. He rolls over towards Nadia, but she's 
               already up and about.

               Alone in his bedroom, John holds the now-finished jumper up 
               to himself. He tries it on. It's a good four sizes too big, 
               the arms are too long and it hangs down to mid-thigh. He 
               looks at himself in the mirror and smiles.CUT TO:INT. STAIRS / HALL / KITCHEN - DAYHe pads downstairs in his pants, picks up his mail from the 
               doormat and peers into the living room. The sleeping bags 
               and guitar cases have gone. About to peruse his mail, his 
               eye is caught by something else.

               There is a small wild deer standing in the living room. 
               Looking at him. John stares back at it transfixed, when he 
               hears a scream. The deer starts and bolts out of the patio 
               doors. John is thrown. It was a woman's scream. He goes back 
               out and looks down the hall.

               Twenty feet away, down the hall, is Yuri, sitting on the 
               kitchen floor, his back to the cooker. He's crying.YURIJohn. You must call the Police.

               Suddenly Alexei steps between them in the doorway. As he 
               moves out of view, we see he is holding his hunting knife. 
               John hears Nadia cry out, from inside the kitchen. He drops 
               his mail and rushes forward.INT. KITCHEN - DAYNadia is tied to a chair. Alexei pulls a gag tight around 
               her mouth and holds the knife to her throat.JOHNWhat are you doing?

               Alexei shouts at Yuri in Russian.YURIJohn, I'm sorry. It's my fault.

               Alexei shouts again. Nadia is frozen with terror.JOHNWhat's he doing? What the fuck are 
                         you doing? Leave her alone.

               Alexei addresses John.YURIHe says sit down. Or he'll cut her.

               Alexei and Yuri shout at each other. Nadia begins crying.YURISit down please.

               John sits across the table from Nadia.JOHNTell him to stop and let her go, and 
                         we'll talk.

               The kettle boils. Alexei takes the kettle and holds it over 
               Nadia's head.

               John springs up.JOHNPut the fucking kettle down.YURIJohn.JOHNPut the fucking kettle down. Tell,

               Yuri translates -- Alexei replies.YURIHe says you scare him so much he 
                         must go to the toilet in his trousers.

                         that you must pay someone to have 
                         sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a

                         I'll give him money.

               Yuri translates this for Alexei. Alexei has a reply.YURIHe wants a lot of money.JOHNI'll give him money. Tell him to put

                         you can not.JOHNOh Jesus. Of course I can't.

               Alexei doesn't need the translation he tilts the kettle, and 
               a small amount of boiling water trickles onto Nadia's hair. 
               She screams through the gag.

               John tries to reach across to her but Alexei draws the knife 
               and holds it to his face.JOHNJust leave her alone.YURII'm so sorry.JOHNLeave her alone.

               John spots them in the mirror and nearly crashes the car.

               He looks desperately across at Yuri. Yuri is now pointing 
               the big knife at John's ribs. The Russian shrugs almost 
               apologetically.

               In the back seat Nadia has freed herself and is beginning to 
               pull at Alexei's clothes. They begin making out passionately.

               Nadia appears from the kitchenette area. They all seem more 
               relaxed, more themselves, as if what we've seen before was

               Yuri goes into the bathroom, leaving Nadia and Alexei alone 
               on the bed.

               Alexei runs his hand across Nadia's cheek.ALEXEI(softly)

                         make all this easier I think.

               From his back pocket, Yuri takes out an old envelope. He 
               opens it and removes a dozen or so Polaroids.

               John looks down at the first Polaroid. Nadia, Alexei and a 
               man John doesn't recognise at a birthday party. There is a 
               cake with candles and everyone is smiling. The next picture 
               is the same. And the next.

               Sometimes Germany, sometimes France, but otherwise the 
               pictures are the same, each 'fiancee' beaming with his arm 
               round Nadia, Alexei looking on.

               John studies the faces of his fellow dupes and at last comes 
               to his own picture. Despite himself tears come to his eyes.YURINot all these bastards were like 
                         you, believe me. You should not too 
                         feel bad.

               Yuri takes John's left hand and pulls off Nadia's ring. He 
               puts it in his pocket.INT. MOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHTAlexei smokes on the bed. Nadia is lying the other way. She 
               holds her hand out for his cigarette and he passes it. They 
               have the relaxed air of longtime lovers.

               Subtitles again.NADIAIt's enough isn't it?ALEXEIWhat do you mean?NADIAYou know what I mean babe, It's 
                         enough. We can stop.ALEXEIDo you want to stop?NADIAYes.ALEXEIWe'll stop then.

               They kiss. He takes her hand, and notices the tie marks on 
               her wrists.ALEXEIWhat's this?NADIAIt's nothing. I burnt myself.ALEXEIThat's not a burn.NADIAIt is. I did it cooking.

               They sit there looking at each other.ALEXEIOn both wrists?

               Nadia looks back at him. The seconds pass.NADIAWhat? I did it cooking.

               Alexei studies her face. She pulls a face. He keeps staring.NADIAWhat?

               They sit there in silence. Alexei is so big, and she is so 
               small.NADIAListen, I made you something.

               Nadia leans over the bed, and searches in her bag. Alexei 
               watches her closely. She comes back up with the jumper she 
               has knitted.NADIAPut it on.

               He looks at the jumper, then back at her.NADIAIt's taken me weeks. I want to see 
                         you in it.

               She starts pulling at his shirt. Eventually he pulls the 
               jumper on. It fits perfectly.NADIADo you like it?ALEXEIYeah.

               He is still staring at her.NADIASay thank you.ALEXEIThank you.

               She takes his hands. He is still looking at her. He strokes 
               his hair. He places his big hand around her throat and holds 
               it there, holding her at arms length. She doesn't react, but 
               just looks levelly back at him. They sit like this for about 
               ten seconds, looking at each other.NADIAWe're going to have a baby.

               Alexei seems not to relax. He keeps his hand there.ALEXEIWhat?NADIAYou heard what I said. I'm pregnant. 
                         I've been throwing up for weeks.

               Alexei removes his hand. Now he seems shocked. He lights a 
               cigarette.NADIAWe're having a baby.

               Pause.ALEXEIA baby? What are we supposed to do 
                         with a baby?NADIAName it.

               She comes to him and holds him. He is still absorbing the 
               news.

               We see Alexei's face over her shoulder, behind her back, 
               unreadable. Behind his back she rubs her wrists.INT. BATHROOM - NIGHTSome hours later, it's dark outside. John still tied to the 
               bidet. The door opens a crack and somebody slips inside. We 
               hear the toilet seat go down. As his eyes adjust he can dimly 
               see Nadia sitting on the toilet. She doesn't look at him. As 
               she finishes she finally turns and holds his eye. She stands 
               and slips out the door, leaving him alone.EXT. DUAL CARRIAGEWAY - NIGHTCars crawl by on the road outside, their tail-lights 
               stretching over the hill.

               The early morning commuters now use the carriageway.INT. BATHROOM - DAYBright sunlight pours through a high window. John is still 
               on the toilet. He begins to try to struggle free.

               After a great deal of fierce deadpan shimmying and pulling, 
               he succeeds in loosening his bindings. Freeing an arm, he 
               yanks the duct tape from his mouth and sits there panting.

               The first thing he does is take a pee, then he drinks handfuls 
               of water. He catches his reflection but can't look at himself.INT. MAIN ROOM - DAYJohn collapses in an armchair, rubbing his eyes. He looks 
               shattered.

               hit him.INT. MOTEL MAIN SUITE - DAYJohn dries himself in silence. He pulls on his trousers, 
               sits down to do his socks. One sock on, he walks to the 
               smaller bedroom. He opens the door and peers inside.INT. SMALLER MOTEL BEDROOM - DAYTied to the radiator, gagged with duct tape, is Nadia.

               John looks down at her. She looks away as her eyes fill with 
               tears.

               He sits on the bed facing her. They stay like that for a 
               long moment before he reaches over and starts untying her 
               knots. He peels the tape off her mouth. Suddenly he slaps 
               her across the face.

               Her head hits the radiator. Nadia gasps hard from the shock 
               of the blow. Without warning she slaps his face, equally 
               hard.

               This starts a long silent fight; kicking, hitting, biting, a 
               real struggle.

               Its intensity is almost sexual, but has the edge of real 
               violence. They end up on opposite sides of the room, both 
               panting, hurt and beaten.NADIA(in English)
                         Great. You've split my fuckin, lip.

               John lies there on the floor, panting, and he hears the 
               English words.

               Exhausted, John stands, wipes his mouth, and rushes her anew. 
               Nadia dodges out the way and cuffs him painfully on the ear. 
               The whole fight starts again and ends only when neither has 
               the strength to go on. Nadia staggers into the bathroom where 
               she shuts the door and begins to sob uncontrollably. John 
               lies on the bed listening to her cry.EXT. DUAL CARRIAGEWAY - DAYThe mid morning traffic flows by on the dual carriageway.INT. HAPPY EATER - DAYNadia and John sit in silence in the half empty diner. Nadia 
               has a cut lip and a graze on her chin. John has a Thousand 
               Yard Stare and a lesion over his left cheekbone.

               The Waitress comes over.WAITRESSGood morning. What can I get you?NADIAI'll have an espresso, with a small 
                         pastry, a croissant or something.WAITRESSWe only do a croissant with the

               John doesn't answer.NADIAHe'll have a coffee.

               The waitress leaves them. Nadia lights a cigarette and they 
               sit in tense silence, the pain of betrayal, and recent 
               violence, thick in the air.JOHNYou can't smoke in here.

               Nadia ignores him. John bellowsJOHNYOU CAN'T SMOKE IN HERE!The diner falls silent, people stare. She takes a last drag 
               and crushes the butt on the floor. A waitress comes over and 
               puts down two coffees.NADIAI don't expect you to understand.

               It seems as if John has no intention of replying. He sips 
               his coffee, and puts it down. He begins speaking very calmly.JOHNOh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy 
                         Assistant of New Business at the 
                         bank would have to listen to the 
                         problems of a great many individuals. 
                         This took a lot of understanding and 
                         sympathy, to try to work out solutions 
                         to their problems. But, you see, I'm 
                         not in that line of work anymore. 
                         Nowadays I'm a bank robber.NADIAYou don't understand anything.JOHNI think that about covers it. I think 
                         I have grasped the part about you 
                         being dumped though. That's got to

                         Famously.

               He sips his coffee.JOHNUnless. Unless this is part of the 
                         routine. You get tied up, stick

                         to the men, they fall faster. It's

                         miffed.NADIAHe will come back.JOHNExcuse me?NADIAHe left me my passport and ticket. 
                         It's pretty clear he wants to see me 
                         again.JOHNYeah. I tend to tie up and abandon 
                         women I really want to see again 
                         too.NADIANo. But you tend to tie them up.

               John freezes. He looks across. Nadia gives nothing back.JOHNFuck off.

               Nadia is just looking at him.JOHNFuck off. You started it.

               She is just looking at him.JOHNI don't want to talk about it.NADIAWhy not?JOHNShut up. I'm not listening.NADIAYou don't want to talk about it.JOHNNo.NADIAOkay we won't talk about it.

               Nadia looks out the window.NADIAWe'll pretend it never happened.JOHNSo. What's it like having to fuck 
                         men you hate?NADIAI don't hate you.JOHNOkay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have 
                         had sex with people you don't like 
                         haven't you? For money. To make money.NADIAAnd? What are you saying?JOHNAnd. It's wrong.NADIAAnd who says what is wrong.JOHNAnd that would be Morals. That would 
                         be one's own moral sense of decency.NADIAWhat's a moral orgasm John? Tell me 
                         how it feels exactly.JOHNSo. What then? You just detach sex 
                         from everything..NADIAWhereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional 
                         journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's 
                         pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.JOHNListen. I didn't go rooting around 
                         in your private stuff.

               John remembers he did. Nadia looks across knowingly.NADIAFunny. Usually it's the first thing 
                         they do.

               Pause.JOHNSo what? Do you just switch off in 
                         your head or do you imagine you're 
                         with him, or what?NADIASometimes.JOHNSometimes which?NADIASometimes neither.JOHNSome... What does that mean?NADIAThere's nothing wrong in liking sex, 
                         John.JOHNI don't like sex. I don't think I'll 
                         be having sex ever again.NADIAWhy?JOHNWell, it's just that the thought 
                         trying to charm up an erection in 
                         front of a woman, or alone for that 
                         matter, makes me want to die.NADIASo now you hate all women?JOHNI think it's my safest bet, don't 
                         you?NADIAOh. I think you will recover okay. I 
                         think you got what you paid for.

               John looks across.JOHNWhat?NADIAYou...JOHNI got what I paid for.NADIAYou didn't mind too much.

               Pause.JOHN(quietly)
                         It wasn't what I wanted.NADIASo what did you want? I think we 
                         understand each other, no?JOHN(quietly)
                         You don't understand me.NADIAYou don't understand you either.

               John turns to her.NADIAIt's no big thing. You are the same 
                         as most men. You are a man so you 
                         are a savage. Not a monster, but 
                         half animal. You put on a tie and 
                         you go to the bank, but really you 
                         are a beast. But also you are from 
                         woman so you have a soul. Half beast, 
                         half soul. But you hide your beast 
                         in the bottom of the wardrobe. It's 
                         not so healthy. It's fucked you up, 
                         no?

               John stops the car.JOHNGet out.

               She sits there.NADIAExcuse me?JOHNGet outNADIAYou are throwing me out.JOHNGet out.

               She collects her bag from the back seat, her cigarettes, 
               gathers up her belongings, clicks open the door and gets 
               out, leaving the shot. John sits there staring ahead. We 
               hear her voice offscreen.NADIA (O.S.)You prefer your women mute.

               John turns the key in the ignition. The engine bellows and 
               screams. Silence.

               He tries again. The engine shrieks and wails like a soul in 
               torment. A terrible, mournful grinding noise. Silence.NADIA (O.S.)Car trouble?

               John tries to start it. It lets out a whimper, a crying, a 
               few juddering moving sobs, and dies.

               John sits in his dead car. He shakes his head. He rubs his 
               face. He sits there.EXT. ROADSIDE VERGE - DUSKThe two of them on a verge ten feet apart. John stares into 
               the distance.

               Nadia studies the map.NADIAIt's another twenty miles. It's going 
                         dark.

               She gets her holdall from inside the car and stuffs the map 
               inside.NADIAWhat now?

               Nadia scans the horizon with her binoculars. John watches 
               her.JOHNJesus. You weren't even on the plane.

               Nadia lowers her binoculars and looks at John.FLASHBACK - INT. AIRPORT - DAYJohn watches the passengers stream out of the arrivals gate. 
               A woman is greeted and spun around.

               Across the airport, Nadia lowers her binoculars. We pull 
               back to see she is standing next to Alexei.

               They say goodbye in Russian. Even though we don't see 
               subtitles, it's a telling exchange. She kisses him, and he 
               watches her leave him and walk across the floor.

               Alexei watches Nadia approach John, and see him shake her 
               hand.

               They walk away together.FLASHBACK - EXT. JOHN'S STREET - NIGHTAlexei, dressed in a suit, stands outside John's house, 
               looking up. Nadia is in the window, her lipstick smeared. 
               They gaze at each other.EXT. DIFFERENT FOREST - NIGHTIn a clearing, John watches Nadia carry a pile of sticks to 
               a fire she is building. She lights it with her gun cigarette 
               lighter, and teases the flames to life.EXT. FOREST - NIGHTJohn and Nadia sit by the fire. She sits wrapped up to her 
               neck in a blanket.NADIAYou know, in Russia, there's no work 
                         for women. It's a different world.JOHN(interrupting on 
                              "different")

                         So how old were you when you met 
                         him?

               Pause.NADIAFifteen. You don't know him. He was 
                         very kind and strong.JOHNYeah. He's a smashing bloke.NADIAThe rest of the world, John, it's 
                         not all like St. Albans.JOHNThank Christ for that.NADIAYou are pretty naive if you think it 
                         is.JOHNI'm pretty naive? Look at you. You 
                         have to do all this, and what have 
                         you got to show for it? Nothing.NADIAI don't have nothing.JOHNWell what have you got?

               Pause.NADIAI have my baby.

               They sit there in the lapping firelight.JOHNDo you know if it's a boy or a girl?NADIANo.JOHNHave you had any before?NADIANo.JOHNAre you scared?NADIANot really. Maybe a little.

               A fox cries out in the night.NADIAListen. I think it's a fox.

               She listens. It cries out again. She gets out her binoculars.NADIAIt sounds close.

               She looks through them and searches the brush. John watches 
               Nadia with her binoculars. He looks suddenly very sad.NADIAI can't see anything. It's too dark.

               She puts them back in her bag. John watches her. He sees her 
               wrist again. She lights a cigarette, and blows the smoke 
               into the air.NADIAWhat happened between you and the 
                         blonde?JOHNWhat?NADIAThe thin... the girl with small eyes. 
                         The one in your cupboard.JOHNIt's none of your business. She didn't 
                         have small eyes.NADIADid she leave you? Come on. It's 
                         nothing to be ashamed of. Who did 
                         she leave you for? Your best friend? 
                         Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you 
                         for a woman, John?JOHNShe's dead.

               Pause.NADIAI'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt 
                         you. I'm sorry. That's awful. Forgive 
                         me.

               Pause.NADIAI'm sorry.JOHNI don't know why I said that. She's 
                         not dead at all.

               Nadia looks at John.NADIAWhat?JOHNI don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.NADIAShe's alive?

               Nadia starts to laugh. Long and loud. We have never seen her 
               laugh before.NADIAShe's alive!! She is not dead?JOHNLaugh it up.

               She starts to cough. She gets on her hands and knees and 
               coughs like fury.JOHNYou should stop smoking. You're 
                         pregnant. You smoke like a fucking 
                         lab dog.NADIAI'm trying to quit.JOHNI've got news for you. It's not 
                         working.NADIAI smoke more these days. I smoke 
                         more when I'm unhappy.JOHNNobody's that unhappy.NADIAMaybe I want to die. Don't you want 
                         me to die?JOHNI don't want anyone to die.NADIAExcept for Small Eyes.JOHNExcept for Small Eyes.

               She laughs again.NADIASo why did it end?

               John thinks. It looks as if he's going to tell the whole 
               story. In the end he shrugs.JOHNI don't know.NADIAWhat was her name?JOHNWhat's your name?

               The fox cries out again.NADIAListen. It's definitely a fox. Now 
                         I'm scared.

               They listen to the fox crying in the night.NADIAYou know you can come under the 
                         blanket.JOHNIt's alright.

               The scene from bird's eye view. John lies back and stares at 
               the stars. Nadia curls up on the other side of the fire, and 
               hugs herself.

               We push down closer and closer until we are on John's face. 
               The theme returns.

               The cricket boys from John's Close stand in a line in the 
               middle of the street, bathed in flashing blue light. We pan 
               round and end on John's house.

               It is surrounded with Police.

               Police cars, Police Vans, plastic police tape "POLICE LINE.DO NOT CROSS."John's neighbours press against the tape as officers come 
               and go.

               Inside the house is full of police, ransacking his possessions 
               and dusting fingerprints. A policeman is standing reading 
               The English-Russian Dictionary.

               We push on upstairs and along the landing to the spare room.

               An officer dumps a pile of porno magazines and videos on the 
               bed. He then spots the belts tied to the bedstead and points 
               them out to a detective. They exchange a knowing grin. A 
               photographer steps up and snaps the paraphernalia in a 
               blinding flash.

               The birthday cake is there, half eaten. A Policewoman puts 
               it in a baggy.

               We pan across the bed, across the magazines and underwear in 
               plastic bags, down below the bed, where we find the photograph 
               of Nadia with the binoculars.

               The young girl smiles hopefully out at us from the past.

               Early dawn. A woodpigeon coos. John wakes up next to the 
               dead fire. Nadia is gone.EXT. FOREST SLOPE / STREAM - DAYJohn slides down a rocky slope. He scans the forest, but 
               there's no-one around. He hurries through high bracken then 
               stops suddenly by a large oak.EXT. STREAM - DAYIn a pool in a stream below, Nadia is washing herself. She 
               has her back to us.

               John watches her for a moment, before his eyes avert, and 
               his head bows.EXT. FIELD - DAYA shimmering sun. A giant combine harvester cuts a wide swathe 
               through a field of high corn. As it passes we find John and 
               Nadia coming towards us through the heat haze.

               They aren't speaking and both look tired. As they pass we 
               crane up out of the corn to catch an enormous 757 Jumbo Jet 
               just above us, coming into land. We pan round to see, half a 
               mile away, the massive airport beyond.

               They walk towards it, two tiny figures.CUT TO:Aeroflot 1311. Boarding Gate 12.INT. AIRPORT - NIGHTAn attendant pushes a train of trolleys past. Businessmen 
               talk into mobile phones.NADIAI've got an hour. Can I buy you a 
                         coffee?JOHNNo. I think I better just go.NADIAOkay. Thank you.JOHNWhatever.

               Nadia hesitates. There's just a touch of regret in this 
               goodbye.NADIAJohn. These are for you.

               She hands him the binoculars case.JOHNYeah. No thanks.NADIAPlease. Why not?JOHNBecause it was a lie.

               She smiles.NADIANo it wasn't.

               John shrugs. He takes them.NADIAGoodbye.

               John nods and turns. Nadia watches him walk away.INT. / EXT. AIRPORT EXIT - NIGHTOn the other side of the airport, John stands in front of 
               the exit to the taxi ranks. He's got nowhere to go. Passengers 
               swirl around him.

               He looks at the binocular in his hands. He removes the 
               binoculars and looks at them. Suddenly he stops. In the case 
               is a folded note marked John. John holds it in his hands -- 
               Slowly, deliberately, he screws it up, and drops it in the 
               case like a bin.P.O.V. OF JOHNThrough the binoculars. Passengers criss-cross, but we find 
               Nadia sitting alone, waiting for her call.

               John lowers the binoculars and gazes across the airport. He 
               raises them for one last look.

               Nadia, glimpsed through the crowd. We spy someone standing 
               about twenty feet behind her. It is Alexei.

               We watch Alexei approach her. She looks up and is completely 
               thrown.

               Yuri stands about ten feet away, in shades.

               John lowers the binoculars, horrified. He looks again.

               Nadia pulls her arm away. Alexei crouches down in front of 
               her and puts a hand on her knee, coaxing her.

               Alexei takes her by the arm and leads her away.EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHTJohn hurries out of the exit to catch the trio leaving a 
               different exit fifty yards away, where they get into a taxi.EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHTJohn runs across a car park and over a low fence.EXT. SLIP ROAD TO AIRPORT - NIGHTHe chases down a slip road, as the taxi rounds the corner 
               behind us. He takes cover behind a van as they drive past, 
               and away.EXT. GRASS VERGE - NIGHTJohn runs across a grass verge and another car park. He sees 
               the taxi rounding the corner and head down the road in front 
               of him.

               John runs as fast as he can up this road, but the taxi is 
               getting away. Eventually he gives up, and he drives away.EXT. ROUNDABOUT - NIGHTAt the roundabout it turns round and starts coming back up 
               the road. John hides behind a car, and watches the taxi pull 
               up outside a small hotel about fifty yards away. He watches 
               the trio head into the hotel.EXT. HOTEL PERIMETER - NIGHTJohn skirts around the edge of the hotel. He peers in through 
               one of the windows. It's the foyer. He heads around the back.EXT. BACK OF HOTEL - NIGHTAt the back of the hotel he looks through another couple of 
               windows. Suddenly he drops like he's been shot, and sits on 
               the grass.

               Warily he looks again.EXT. / INT. THE VIEW THROUGH THE WINDOWAlexei stands smoking in the middle of the room. Nadia is 
               sitting in a chair crying.

               Alexei kneels again and appeals to her. Nadia is resisting 
               and yells back, but something Alexei says seems to melt her 
               resolve.

               He holds her face, and kisses it. She turns her face. He 
               tries again, and this time she accepts the kiss. Slowly she 
               kisses him back.EXT. OUTSIDE ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHTJohn stares through the window at the scene.INT. INSIDE ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHTIn the room, Yuri pops his head round the door and says 
               something to Alexei.

               Alexei says he's coming. He kisses Nadia again and leaves.

               Nadia is alone. She looks very sad and confused. She moves 
               towards the window and stares out into the blackness.EXT. OUTSIDE ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHTJohn's face at the window. Almost cheek to cheek with Nadia.INT.

               drawers. She goes over to the bed and looks under the pillow. 
               There she finds what she is looking for. Alexei's hunting 
               knife.

               John ducks down, panting, swallowing hard. At once he springs 
               up and skirts the building again. He finds a window to the 
               next suite.

               He tries to force it open. Suddenly Yuri's face appears in 
               the window, cupped by his hands peering out into the 
               blackness. John drops down holds his breath.

               John scrambles back to the previous window. With real effort 
               he presses it open. He pulls himself up and drops inside.INT. ALEXEI'S BEDROOM - NIGHTNadia still stands by the window, one hand behind her back. 
               Alexei sits on the bed. The scene is subtitled.ALEXEII love you. I don't need to tell you 
                         that.

               Nadia looks at the floor.ALEXEII wouldn't leave my child would I?

               end of a corridor from the bedroom. He can hear Alexei's 
               voice.

               Breathing hard, he tiptoes out and stands in the corridor, 
               his back pressed hard against the wall. He takes one step 
               down the hall. The floor creaks loudly.INT. ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHTALEXEIIt wasn't easy for me. You know what 
                         I'm like. I needed to know what I

               are the two guitar cases full of money. Next to them is 
               Nadia's bag. Crouching, John opens the bag and searches 
               inside. He finds what he is looking for; the Silver Cigarette 
               Lighter-Pistol.

               We hear the Russian lovers' voices next door. John is 
               absolutely terrified, breathing hard and shaking, holding 
               the little gun.INT. ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHTALEXEIYou still love me? Eh? Of course you

                         for a while. Come on babe.

               He takes his shirt off -- Nadia glances up -- With horror, 
               she sees John in the doorway.

               Alexei turns to see John stand by the door, holding a little 
               silver gun.NADIAWhat are you doing here?

               John and Nadia look at each other.ALEXEIWhat the fuck is he doing here?

               Alexei stands. John takes a step back. Alexei walks calmly 
               towards John and throws a punch. It catches John right on 
               the chin and he hits the wall and goes down very fast.NADIAStop.

               He looks at Nadia, the girl he came back for, angrily pointing 
               the knife at him. He suddenly looks completely punctured. 
               John has struggled up again and stands behind him. They are 
               both looking at Nadia.ALEXEIWhat. You're what? You're with this

                         away.

               Nadia stares back at him. The seconds pass. She speaks in a 
               whisper.NADIAI'll kill you if you try.

               In the impasse, John picks up a lamp and hurls it at Alexei's 
               head. It is going to hit him, but reaches the length of its 
               cord and stops six inches short. In the confusion. Alexei 
               grabs Nadia's wrist and forces her to the ground. He grabs 
               the knife, just as John brains him with one of the guitars. 
               It emits a fruity final chord.INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR / ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHTWhistling, Yuri comes out of his suite, knocks briskly on 
               the door of Alexei's and enters. We walk with him down the 
               hallway into the bedroom to find Alexei, heartbroken, tied 
               and bound to a desk chair.

               Yuri murmurs something in Russian.SUBTITLEFuck a duck.CUT TO:INT. ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHTNadia stands at the window and stares at her reflection, or

               sky.

               He takes Alexei's passport from his pocket, but Alexei is 
               only watching Nadia.ALEXEIDon't do this.

               She carefully places tape across his mouth.

               Almost as if having second thoughts she bends down to kiss 
               his cheek. The 'kiss' suddenly makes Alexei's eyes widen in 
               pain. As she stands her lips are bloody. She's bitten him on 
               the cheek. A single streak of blood runs from the gash.NADIA(to John)

               She leans forward and kisses him. As they kiss, John puts a 
               guitar case in her hand. Nadia looks down at the case.NADIAIt's not mine.JOHNIt's not mine either.NADIAIt's what you came back for.

               She's gone.

               CLOSE UP: John's fingers uncrumple the note from the 
               binoculars case. He smooths it on the table, then opens it.

               Inside is written a short phrase in Russian:

               John looks at the note. He folds it closed and surveys the

               Nadia blows out smoke, and speaks to the policeman. John 
               watches her. He smiles.

               Suddenly she turns and points straight at John. The Policeman 
               look straight at him. As they head towards him, Nadia picks 
               up the cases and walks away.

               Both look forward, straight-faced, as it both are thinking 
               about what it is that they are actually doing. John looks 
               back once, but he keeps walking. He looks across at Nadia, 
               but she doesn't look back.
