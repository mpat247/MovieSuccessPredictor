                                     Melchior LengyelSHOOTING DRAFT1939FADE IN ON:AN ESTABLISHING SHOT OF PARIS IN THE MONTH OF APRILDISSOLVE TO:THE LUXURIOUS LOBBY OF THE HOTEL CLARENCECAMERA MOVES to a CLOSE SHOT of the desk. In the background 
               is a revolving door leading to the street. Through the 
               revolving door comes a strangely dressed individual, obviously 
               one who doesn't belong in such surroundings. It is Comrade 
               Buljanoff, a member of the Russian Board of Trade. Despite 
               the spring climate of Paris, he still wears his typical 
               Russian clothes, consisting of a coat with a fur collar, a 
               fur cap, and heavy boots.

               Buljanoff glances around the lobby, obviously over-whelmed 
               by its magnificence. The Manager, puzzled by Buljanoff's 
               strange appearance, approaches him.MANAGER(politely)
                         Is there anything I can do for you, 
                         monsieur?BULJANOFFNo, no.

               He exits toward the street. The Manager returns to his 
               customary duties, when suddenly a second Russian, similarly 
               dressed, pushes his way through the door and gazes around. 
               It is Comrade Iranoff.

               The Manager, definitely mystified by now, approaches him.MANAGERYes, monsieur?IRANOFFJust looking around.

               Iranoff exits. Again the Manager returns to his duties, when 
               suddenly he sees that a third man, dressed in the same 
               fashion, has appeared in the revolving door. It is Comrade 
               Kopalski.

               Kopalski doesn't leave the revolving door at all but as it 
               turns, drinks in the whole spectacle of the lobby. The Manager 
               is by now dumfounded.STREET IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL CLARENCEA taxi stands at the curb. Buljanoff and Iranoff are waiting 
               beside it, Iranoff holding a suitcase. Kopalski, returning 
               from the hotel, joins the group.KOPALSKIComrades, why should we lie to each 
                         other? It's wonderful.IRANOFFLet's be honest. Have we anything 
                         like it in Russia?ALL THREE(agreeing with him)
                         No, no, no.IRANOFFCan you imagine what the beds would 
                         be in a hotel like that?KOPALSKIThey tell me when you ring once the 
                         valet comes in; when you ring twice 
                         you get the waiter; and do you know 
                         what happens when you ring three 
                         times? A maid comes in -- a French 
                         maid.IRANOFF(with a gleam in his 
                              eye)
                         Comrades, if we ring nine times... 
                         let's go in.BULJANOFF(stopping him)
                         Just a minute -- just a minute -- I 
                         have nothing against the idea but I 
                         still say let's go back to the Hotel 
                         Terminus. Moscow made our reservations 
                         there, we are on an official mission, 
                         and we have no right to change the 
                         orders of our superior.IRANOFFWhere is your courage, Comrade 
                         Buljanoff?KOPALSKIAre you the Buljanoff who fought on 
                         the barricades? And now you are afraid 
                         to take a room with a bath?BULJANOFF(stepping back into 
                              the taxi)
                         I don't want to go to Siberia.

               Iranoff and Kopalski follow him reluctantly.IRANOFFI don't want to go to the Hotel 
                         Terminus.KOPALSKIIf Lenin were alive he would say, 
                         "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in 
                         your life you're in Paris. Don't be 
                         a fool. Go in there and ring three 
                         times."IRANOFFHe wouldn't say that. What he would 
                         say is "Buljanoff, you can't afford 
                         to live in a cheap hotel. Doesn't 
                         the prestige of the Bolsheviks mean 
                         anything to you? Do you want to live 
                         in a hotel where you press for the 
                         hot water and cold water comes and 
                         when you press for the cold water 
                         nothing comes out at all? Phooey, 
                         Buljanoff!"BULJANOFF(weakening)
                         I still say our place is with the 
                         common people, but who am I to 
                         contradict Lenin? Let's go in.

               All three start to leave the taxi, as weDISSOLVE TO:LOBBY -- HOTEL CLARENCE -- AT THE DESKBuljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski are approaching the Manager, 
               their only suitcase carried by two of them.KOPALSKIAre you the manager?MANAGER(eyeing the three

                              them)
                         Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates 
                         are rather high.BULJANOFFWhy should you be afraid?

               The other two nod their agreement. The Manager has noted the 
               single suitcase.MANAGER(haughtily)
                         I might be able to accommodate you. 
                         Is there some more luggage?IRANOFFOh, yes, but have you a safe here 
                         big enough to hold this?MANAGERI'm afraid we have no boxes of that 
                         size in our vault, but there is one 
                         suite with a private safe...IRANOFFThat's even better.MANAGERBut, gentlemen, I am afraid...BULJANOFFHe's always afraid.

               The other two exchange a look of agreement again.MANAGER(a little annoyed)
                         I just wanted to explain. The 
                         apartment may suit your convenience 
                         but I doubt that it will fit your 
                         convictions. It's the Royal Suite.

               The mention of the Royal Suite startles the three.BULJANOFFRoyal Suite!
                              (To the manager)
                         Just a minute.

               The Three Russians take a step away from the manager and go 
               into a huddle.BULJANOFF(in a low voice)
                         Now Comrades, I warn you... if it 
                         gets out in Moscow that we stay in 
                         the Royal Suite we will get into 
                         terrible trouble.IRANOFF(defending his right 
                              to a good time)
                         We'll just say we had to take it on 
                         account of the safe. That's a perfect 
                         excuse. There was no other safe big 
                         enough.

               The other two welcome the suggestion with relish.BULJANOFF AND IRANOFFThat's right. Good, very good.

               Suddenly Buljanoff grows skeptical again.BULJANOFFOf course, we could take out the 
                         pieces and distribute them in three 
                         or four boxes in the vault and take 
                         a small room. That's an idea, isn't 
                         it?

               For a moment all three see their bright plans crumble. Then 
               Iranoff comes to the rescue.IRANOFFYes, it's an idea, but who says we 
                         have to have an idea?

               Buljanoff and Kopalski see the logic of this and their faces 
               light up.BOTHThat's right... that's right.BULJANOFF(turning to the Manager)
                         Give us the Royal Suite.

               The Manager leads the three toward the elevator. The CAMERA 
               FOLLOWS THEM and NARROWS DOWN to the suitcase carried by two 
               of the Russians.DISSOLVE TO:DARK INTERIOR OF SAFE -- ROYAL SUITEWe hear from the outside the turning of a key, the opening 
               of a door, then the turning of the dial, and then we see the 
               safe door open. Through the open door we now see the Royal 
               Suite. The Three Russians are standing in front of the safe. 
               One of them puts the suitcase into it.MEDIUM SHOT -- ROYAL SUITE OF THE HOTEL CLARENCEShooting from the interior of the room toward the safe. The 
               Three Russians are standing around it. As Buljanoff and 
               Iranoff close the safe door, Kopalski walks out of the shot. 
               The CAMERA STAYS for a few seconds on Buljanoff and Iranoff, 
               then PANS OVER to the center of the room, where a waiter is 
               setting a breakfast table. He is the former Count Rakonin, a 
               Russian exile employed by the Hotel Clarence. Rakonin is 
               looking with great interest toward the safe, and as he does 
               so we hear Kopalski's voice talking into the telephone.KOPALSKI'S VOICEWill you connect me with Mercier... 
                         yes, the jeweler...

               Rakonin pricks up his ears and looks toward the telephone.CLOSE SHOT -- KOPALSKI -- AT TELEPHONEKOPALSKII want to speak with Monsieur Mercier 
                         personally... Hello, Monsieur Mercier? 
                         This is Kopalski of the Russian Board 
                         of Trade. We arrived this morning... 
                         Thank you.CLOSE SHOT -- RAKONINAs he sets the breakfast table, his interest in the telephone 
               conversation increases.KOPALSKI'S VOICEYes, everything is here. The necklace 
                         too. All fourteen pieces... What? 
                         No, Monsieur Mercier, the court jewels 
                         of the Duchess Swana consisted of 
                         fourteen pieces. Why don't you check 
                         on that? Naturally, we have all the

               A terrific roar of laughter arises; the whole restaurant is 
               rocking with laughter.

               For a split second Ninotchka makes an effort to control the 
               irresistible impulse to laugh but loses the battle and herself 
               roars with laughter.LEON(indignantly)
                         What's funny about this?

               Ninotchka's laughter is uncontrollable.

               After a moment Leon gets up and sits next to her. As he dries 
               himself with his napkin he sees the humor of the situation 
               and starts to howl with laughter too. The ice is broken at

               The Russians stammer a negative answer.

               she goes into the bedroom. She proceeds to the door leading

               takes a little key from her handbag, goes to the bureau and 
               unlocks the drawer, opens it, and, just as she is about to 
               take out something, her eye falls on the night table, where 
               she sees the picture of Lenin which she brought with her 
               from Moscow. She walks over to it and turns its face against 
               the wall, then goes back to the bureau and takes from the 
               drawer the very hat which twice aroused her disapproval when 
               it was displayed in the millinery shop in the lobby.

               She moves over to the large mirror, puts the hat on her head, 
               is uncertain whether it is right side to fore, and changes 
               it. She looks at herself, aghast at seeing a complete 
               stranger. She sits down, still staring in the mirror, then 
               leans forward and rests her chin on her hand. As she sits

                         it...

               They kiss again. As the kiss ends they look at each other 
               for a second.

               Ninotchka gets up and goes toward the desk, sits in the desk 
               chair, opens her handbag, which lies there, and takes from 
               it a little mirror and a lipstick. Before she uses it she 
               looks at Leon with guilty happiness. Leon looks at her with 
               great tenderness and walks over to the desk and stands looking 
               at her as she makes up her lips.LEONWhat a gesture for a sergeant.

               As soon as she is finished, Ninotchka slips the mirror and 
               lipstick back into her handbag and, as she does so, glances 
               at the top of the desk.NINOTCHKALeon, I would like to ask you

                         a waste of silver. That's all that 
                         interested me then. Now I would like 
                         to know... what happened to the woman?

               Leon too is completely serious by now. For answer he quietly 
               opens the drawer of the desk. Ninotchka looks in and takes 
               from the drawer the photograph. As she looks at it she rises.NINOTCHKAThe Duchess.

               her.SWANAI know how you feel, my dear. The

                         to your condition. I remember once 
                         in Petrograd when I felt exactly as 
                         you do. I had to bow from a balcony

               practicing on her cello. Apparently Ninotchka has not adjusted

               the table in the center of the floor for a party of four. 
               Out of her cupboard she takes very primitive-looking dishes,

                         wedding present.

               Anna is for a moment speechless over this generous gift. She 
               embraces and kisses Ninotchka.ANNANinotchka! Ninotchka!

               She kisses her again, takes her cello, and starts to leave.ANNAAm I going to play that cadenza 
                         tonight!

               Anna exits, closing the door. Ninotchka is left alone. Her 
               thoughts are still in the other world, obviously with Leon. 
               Mechanically she looks over the table to see if everything 
               is all right, then she walks over to the radio (a primitive 
               little machine). As she turns the knob she smiles again 
               reminiscently. As she does, the blare of a Russian speech 
               brings her back to reality.VOICE ON RADIOIndividuals? Yes, as atoms in the

               Quickly she turns the knob and again there is a burst of 
               Russian oratory.SECOND VOICE ON RADIO...From the Exploiters for the Toilers. We are going full

               Ninotchka turns off the radio. She closes her eyes for a 
               moment and with a sad smile murmurs to herself.NINOTCHKANo music.

               and the Three Russians.ALL THREE RUSSIANSNinotchka! Ninotchka!

               A moment of silence follows. The four look at each other as

               There is a dead silence. All are again aware of the reality 
               which surrounds. They concentrate quietly on the frying pan.DISSOLVE TO:INSERT OF THE FRYING PANThe eggs are gradually taking the shape of an omelet.DISSOLVE TO:INSERT OF A PLATE ON THE TABLEOnly the last scraps of the omelet are on it. Buljanoff's

               sitting around the table, in the center of which is a samovar. 
               In front of each of them is a glass of tea. One of the 
               Russians is playing a balalaika and all are singing gaily, 
               "Paris."

               Ninotchka is enjoying their companionship. After a little 
               while the door to the corridor opens and Ninotchka's other 
               roommate, the street-car conductor, strides in. She is a 
               squareset, unfriendly woman in uniform.

               At sight of her one of the Russians nudges Ninotchka, makes 
               the gesture of ringing up a fare, and accompanies it with an 
               inquiring look. Ninotchka nods. The Russians change their 
               tune quickly to the "Volga Boatman" in order not to awaken 
               animosity.

               The street-car conductor goes to her bed and starts to take 
               off her shoes and her coat, then draws the curtain. During 
               the following scene we hear the splash of water and the sound 
               of gargling.

               Again Gurganov crosses the room, this time accompanied by 
               his little son.

               Ninotchka sits in the chair nearest the lamp. All three are 
               looking over her shoulder. Ninotchka hesitates to open the 
               letter, obviously wanting to read it all by herself. Realizing 
               her feelings, the Three Russians walk to the far end of the 
               room and sit down on a little bench, looking toward Ninotchka 
               with childlike expectancy. In great anticipation Ninotchka 
               opens the letter. She starts to read it. Suddenly her 
               expression changes to one of terrific disappointment. She 
               turns the letter over, glances at the second page, then puts
