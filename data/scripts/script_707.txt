                                       Tom DiCilloSHOOTING DRAFT1995A battered 35mm movie camera stands alone on a wooden tripod 
               surrounded by blackness. Opening credits begin. An almost 
               imperceptible DOLLY in toward the movie camera. The dolly 
               forward continues throughout the credits ending in an EXTREME 
               CU of the camera's lens, filling the frame like a giant, 
               glass full moon. Fade to BLACK.

               Suddenly a door opens directly in front of the camera, wiping 
               the lens and revealing the following scene in Black and White.EXT. STREET. NYC. NIGHTA quiet, deserted industrial street. It is over an hour before 
               dawn and the street is still cloaked in the heavy stillness 
               of night.

               In the weak light filtering out of their battered van, BERT 
               and CYBIL -- the Craft Service Managers, finish setting out 
               breakfast supplies on a 6' table. They work in almost complete 
               silence, both nearly paralyzed with sleep. A cheap walkie-
               talkie, lying beside a paper plate of soggy Oreos, sputters 
               and buzzes occasionally. Other items on the table include a 
               mangled banana, seven grapes, and a box of chocolate covered 
               donuts.BERTWhat time is it?CYBILFour. Why?BERTThis milk is bad.CYBIL(sniffs)
                         When did you buy it?BERTTuesday? I don't know. What's today?CYBILMonday.

                         Is it that bad?CYBILI don't know. You're the one who 
                         said it was bad.

               At that moment a large truck grinds around the corner and 
               shudders to a stop in front of the building. Bert replaces 
               the carton of milk neatly beside the orange juice.EXT. STREET. NYC. NIGHT. B/WAmid low, one-word greetings, the CREW tumbles out of the 
               trucks and stands in a groggy cluster around the Craft Service 
               table. WOLF -- the Cameraman, assumes a place of prominence. 
               He wears a black leather coat, a black beret, and black 
               leather half-fingered gloves.WOLFThis is the worst fucking coffee

               wagon. She glances out at the empty city moving past her 
               window and lets out a deep sigh.

               Camera pans up to reveal CORA, a small woman in her early 
               60s, pacing beneath the awning of her residential hotel. She 
               appears to be rehearsing dialogue with herself.CORAEllen, I have no memory of this

               Cora immediately lights a cigarette. Nicole instinctively 
               wrinkles her nose and turns away. Cora notices this and makes 
               an exaggerated effort to keep the smoke away from Nicole by 
               blowing it hard out the side of her mouth. Jeff glances back 
               at the two women in the rearview mirror. No one speaks.INT. SET. DAWN. B/WNICK -- the Director, WOLF -- the Cameraman and WANDA -- the 
               AD, stand in a loose triangle on the darkened set. All are 
               holding coffee cups. The Gaffer can be seen in the background

                         the taste.

               Suddenly the Gaffer turns on the 5K, flooding the room with 
               harsh, blinding light.NICKJesus!WOLFWhat the fuck?!WANDAFlame on, asshole!!

               The screen goes completely WHITE.INT. SET APT. DAY. B/WScreen is still white. Gradually it shifts back to proper 
               exposure revealing NICOLE in Medium CU. Her eyes are riveting; 
               it is obvious she is emotionally primed for the scene. A 
               light meter is thrust in front of her face. She barely 
               registers it.

               WS, the entire Living Room set. Nicole sits on a sofa facing 
               Cora seated opposite in an overstuffed chair. Two flats have 
               been joined at right angles to create the Living Room corner. 
               A table lamp and assorted framed photographs complete the 
               rather scrawny looking set.

               Most of the movie crew is seen, including Wolf looking through 
               the camera.WANDAOK, picture's up. Quiet. Stop the 
                         work. Lock it up. Going for picture.

               Nick approaches Nicole and Cora.NICKOK, nice and easy. Cora you're doing 
                         fine. Remember, really listen and

               Nick moves behind the camera and looks through the eyepiece. 
               Another CU of Nicole fills the frame. The image is visually 
               and emotionally breathtaking.WOLFI pushed in a foot. She's incredible. 
                         It's coming right through the lens.

               to the shot the set camera is filming. The shot is fluid, 
               graceful and in richly, beautiful COLOR. Nicole's performance 
               is very strong; flawed only slightly by her nervousness.NICOLEDad hit me first and knocked me down. 
                         It didn't hurt that much but I started 
                         crying anyway, hoping he would leave

               The film is in COLOR now. The room is in heavy darkness except 
               for the light on Nick's face. Nick reaches over and shuts 
               off his clock radio. The digital dial shows 4:00 A.M. The 
               beeping finally stops.

               revealing WOLF sitting on the edge of the rumpled bed. He is 
               dressed exactly the same as when we last saw him, complete

                         going on here. These two people have

                         like a dam bursting. Does that make 
                         sense? Nicole?NICOLEIt makes perfect sense. I just haven't 
                         found it yet. I'll get it though.NICKWhat about you, Chad?PALOMINOI'm there, man. I got the dam going,

                         that little change in the blocking

               Palomino saunters over and sprawls on the bed, forcing Nicole 
               to turn her head completely away from the camera.PALOMINOAdmired? That sounds rather

               Nicole remains seated on the bed, lowering her head and 
               closing her eyes as she attempts to generate some emotion 
               for the scene. Everyone watches her in complete silence.INT. NEAR THE CAMERA. DAYPalomino tiptoes over to the camera where Wanda and the 
               Scriptgirl are standing side by side. As he leans between 
               them, checking his lines on the Scriptgirl's script, he

               Thinking he means her, Wanda's lips flutter in a brief, 
               involuntary smile. Meanwhile, the Scriptgirl turns away, 
               blushing furiously.INT. THE SET. DAYPalomino tiptoes again back to his spot. Nicole raises her 
               head and nods once to Nick. She seems to have aroused some

               Scriptgirl approaches carrying a donut in one hand and a cup 
               of coffee in the other. Palomino notices her and moves quietly 
               to her side. Without a word he picks up the milk and pours 
               some in her coffee. Nicole stands nearby and watches the

               Wolf walks off. The Gaffer slips the AC a shrewd wink then 
               walks over and stands next to Palomino, giving him a big,

               Palomino takes the Gaffer's script and holds it up to his

                         slapping a little water on my face.

               The two stand in embarrassed silence for a moment. Nick looks 
               like he's gathering the nerve to ask her out.NICKSo, it's going pretty good, huh?NICOLEIs it? Something feels off.NICKYeah, you seem a little tense.NICOLEDo I?NICKBut don't worry about it. Just take

               Right on his cue, Palomino walks to the bed. As the camera 
               moves into the 2-shot he begins stroking Nicole's hair with

               Under the onslaught of escalating hair-stroking, Nicole

               The Sound man gives Nicole his headphones and rewinds the

               Palomino suddenly punches Nick in the stomach, leaving him 
               bent over and gasping for breath. Nicole instantly leaps on 
               Palomino's back and begins pounding her fist on the top of

               Nicole rolls free as Nick and Palomino wrestle on the bed.

               Palomino's eyes are starting to bug out from the pressure of
