          ANDREW LARGEMAN (LARGE), 25, is the only passenger who
          remains unfazed. Even as the flames from the wing echo fiery
          reflections on his cheeks, even as the young mother seated
          next to him clutches her newborn and wails towards God, even
          as bags fall from the overhead compartment at half-speed and
          the beverage cart slides down the aisle, Andrew Largeman sits
          peacefully; unaffected.

          He calmly reaches up and turns his air vent so it blows
          directly on him. He looks up toTHE FASTEN SEAT BELT SIGNit BINGS as the light flashes on and off. The BINGING
          continues more and more frequently; at first in rhythm with
          the prayer and then it dissolves into the RING of anELECTRONIC TELEPHONE.DISSOLVE TO:INT. BEDROOM -- MORNINGWhiteness. Morning sun streams through a palatial picture
          window. THE PHONE continues to RING. A ceiling fan spins
          above stacks of scripts, a cell phone charging, bare walls
          and a small human figure dwarfed by the enormous white bed in
          which he sleeps.

          HIS BYES bounce back and forth under their lids as he dreams
          like they're chasing each other in a game of tag.
          THE PHONE is finally answered by the machine. Large's eyes
          stop moving.2VOICE ON MACHINE (0.S.)Andrew... This is your father.

          They elide slowly left, then back right as if scanning in

          is there, but his mind seems absent. He reaches to the middle
          of the frame, almost at us, and pulls open both doors of the
          mirror he's been staring into.

          His face and chest are immediately replaced with the two
          dozen orange prescription drug canisters that immaculately
          line the shelves of his medicine cabinet.

          gym where a man on a Stairmaster is walking alongside him.
          Large registers something: he isn't going anywhere.

          THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal he's been walking up on the
          down side. He stands still and lets it bring him all the way
          down, where he moves to the "Up" one and rises towards the
          next level. His expression never changes.INT. CASTING OFFICE -- DAYA casting assistant sits behind stacks of headshots and

          A slow 360 degree pan around the room reveals ten other
          actors identical to Large aggressively rehearsing their lines
          to themselves.

          car.
          THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL: a gasoline pump nozzle
          sitting in his gas tank with a foot of tattered hose ripped
          off at the end. He stares at it, trying to remember the last
          time he bought gas. He looks both ways and covertly pulls the
          nozzle from his tank.
          He walks towards the back door of the restaurant and throws

          of the stress. He rounds a corner to a time card machine and
          swipes his card. The machine BEEPS and displays the word,
          "LATE" in red. He crosses to a locker and quickly changes
          into a black tunic and pants.
          He moves through the kitchen which is whirling with over
          thirty people in white: chopping, frying, sauteing, YELLING.
          The Vietnamese chef wears a headset and BARKS ORDERS down the

          During all this, Large remains calm and unphased. He takes a

          his eyes to appear Asian. (As do all the white, good-looking,

          A moment later he picks up his bag and heads down the line of

          Large eases past all the shelves; trinkets, nothing seems to
          mean anything and thenA PICTURESeveral people are seated amongst dozens of presents
          laughing. A. seven year old Large stands with his arm around
          a seven year old Cynthia. They both wear enormous "chicken-

          Large's POV: zooms into the face of the only person in the

          I had kind of planned on my whole

          money. But now that I've got more

          This guy has one idea and he's a

          ideas, but I gotta sit around and
          wait for all my relatives to die.
          They join the group. Mark blows coke off a large golf book.
          Dave has a young girl on his lap. Large begins to notice that
          the girls in the room, although quite attractive, are pretty
          young; 17-19.
          As he pans the room, he lock eyes with a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG
          GIRL. They play chicken briefly to see who will break the
          stare first. Large does and looks to his right where someone
          has just passed him a joint- He hits it and passes it on.MARKHere, bro.
          He passes Large the golf book.LARGEOh no thanks, man.MARKReally? But you're like a movie

          importantly, how old are they?
          Jesse passes Large the joint.JESSEThey're all legal. I think.
          He smiles a toothy grin. KELLY, a young hot girl with a raspy
          voice takes control.KELLYWell we just ate all this fuckin'

          He snaps his attention to the game. The bottle is pointed
          directly at him.JESSELargeman, this is Dana.
          Large looks over to the sexy young girl whom he locked eyes

          couch. She smiles nervously. Large stares at her. we see in
          his eyes he's feeling more fucked up every instant. She
          stands above him at the couch, then straddles him with her
          knees on either side of his legs; sitting on his lap.
          The MUSIC PLAYS.
          Everyone is speechless. she slowly leans in. Eye contact.

          and gets up. Everyone reacts and some clap.JESSEThis is gonna be a good night.
          Everything SPEEDS-UP and SLOWS DOWN. A barrage of images:
          people hooking up, girls kissing girls, guys feeling girls
          up, joints being passed, one girl crying, Mark showing off
          his golf swing, Large trying to take deep breaths, Jesse and

          streams through a window revealing Large's face, full frame,
          eyes still closed. Across his forehead in thick black marker
          the word "BALLS" is written.

          sunlight pries past the beach towels covering the windows to
          highlight the duet in the air.
          A NOISE in the kitchen pops Large' s eyes open. He has no idea
          where he is.
          Large's POV into the kitchen reveals limited glimpses of a
          person walking around; like a hunter's amateur video of his
          Bigfoot sighting.
          He can only make out pieces: a sword, boots, then a cereal
          box.
          Then quickly the figure turns into perfect view: a medieval
          Knight in full regalia. They make eye contact for a second
          and Large slams his eyes shut. When he opens them again the
          knight is gone.INT. KITCHEN -- LATERLarge and Mark sit with CAROL, mark's mother and TIN PAYTON,

          How long have you been on the

          Celexa, Depakote; did any of that
          ever help you?LARGENo. I mean I don't know. It's
          recently occurred to me that I
          might not even have a problem. only
          I'd never know it, because as far
          back as I can remember I've been
          medicated. I grew up on it. I left
          them in LA. This is the first time
          I haven't had it in my body since I
          can remember.DOCTORWell it'll leave your body pretty

          prescription.LARGEActually I. was thinking about

          psychiatrist about that?LARGEE)h well, my psychiatrist is my Dad.
          So uh... he... I think he'd prefer
          me to stay on it. He likes to think
          it makes me happy. And I let him
          think that because he's sort of
          consumed by the idea of making
          everyone happy.DOCTORWell look, I'll examine you and
          give you a Catscan just so you
          won't worry that it's anything
          serious. But to be honest, I think
          the headaches are something else.
          Our bodies do very funny things
          when they're consumed with stress
          and anxiety. Things you'd never
          expect. I found my ex-best friend's
          cuff links in my wife's puree and I
          couldn't get an erection for a year
          and a half.(BEAT)For example.LARGEBut that doesn't really feel like
          it. I mean I don't feel stressed or
          really anxious at all.DOCTORWell with all the Lithium he's had
          you on it's amazing you can even
          hear me right now_LARGEOh, right.DOCTORFirst of all, I do think you need
          to find a psychiatrist that isn't
          your father. That just's something
          that should have been remedied
          years ago. He knows better.
          Secondly, I'm not in a position to
          comment on whether or not you
          should stay on the meds or not; I
          don't know your story. But my
          opinion, since you're paying for
          it, is that those drugs may help as
          a means to an end. But if you're
          not In any sort of therapy, sooner
          or later what's ever going on in
          your mind will find a way to peek

          Large looks to Sam.LARGEYeah. "Albert's Abyss".ALBERTWho knows? Maybe. But I used to
          think that was all that mattered.
          No matter what it was, as long as I
          could put my name on it. Like it
          would somehow justify the fact that
          I lived; that I was here. "I did
          that. That's mine. I got this plate
          on my travels." But you know what?
          That's all ego; none of that stuff
          really matters. If at the end of
          the day I get to be with her, if I
          get to be with this person right
          here and the baby we created, then
          that's all I need. Just having

          know I've lived.
