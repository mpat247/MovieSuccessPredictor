       ANGLES of a group of men hard at work erecting a large
       striped "big-top" style canvas tent, INCLUDING: The long
       steel stakes being sledge-hammered into the lawn,
       practiced hands rapidly rigging the lines, the tall
       center poles being leveraged upright, the heavy rolled-up
       sections of canvas being maneuvered into position, and
       ENDING WITH the canvas being hoisted up the poles as the
       tent assumes its full and finished form.NEW ANGLE - TENT-- on the front yard of the Abbott mansion. The
       residence is on Main Street, four blocks from where the
       commercial district begins. The mature, over-arching
       trees makes this street of prosperous houses a grand
       promenade.2EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET - DAY                                   2JACEY HOLT and DOUG HOLT walk along the sidewalk on their
       way to school. Jacey is seventeen; he's as handsome and
       seemingly self-confident as his younger brother is
       rumpled and impulsive. Doug is fifteen, a popular
       culture chameleon who takes on the colors and
       affectations of whomever his "hero" is at the moment
       (which presently happens to be Elvis Presley).

       Jacey stops and stares with open-faced misery at the tent
       on the Abbott's front yard (the installation of the tent
       indicates that the Abbott's are having yet another of the
       many parties they throw every year).DOUGDidn't get invited, huh?JACEYGo to hell.DOUGWho cares? I'm not going and I
                   got invited.JACEYWho invited you?(CONTINUED)INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96                     2.2CONTINUED:                                                                2DOUGPam, I guess. I don't know.
                 Didn't open the envelope. I mean,
                 come on, every time an Abbott girl
                 gets her period they have some
                 party.JACEYOh, shut up.DOUGKotex parties, Kotex party hats,
                 pin the Kotex on the...JACEYShut up!

       Jacey swats Doug's school books out from under his arm --
       Doug charges his brother to retaliate but they are rudely
       interrupted by a CAR HORN. They scurry out of the way as
       LLOYD ABBOTT pulls his 1957 Cadillac out of the driveway
       and cruises down the street. Lloyd is a well-dressed-
       and-fed man in his mid-forties. A Midwestern burgher, he
       exudes the status he enjoys as one of the preeminent
       pillars of this community. Doug is embarrassed by
       Lloyd's passing, but Jacey evidently experiences a deeper
       humiliation -- he gives Doug a glance of betrayal, turns
       and walks down the block.3      OMITTED                                                         34INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY (SHORT TIME LATER)                      4ELEANOR ABBOTT gathers some books from her locker.
       Eleanor is sixteen, outgoing, sarcastic, and very
       popular. She is the middle of the three Abbott
       daughters. Eleanor closes her locker, turns and
       discovers Jacey standing behind her. He follows her down
       the busy hall.JACEYI tried to call you last night but
                 the line was busy.ELEANORNo it wasn't.(CONTINUED)INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96                    3.4CONTINUED:                                                               4JACEYIt was busy all night.ELEANORMaybe you had the wrong number?JACEYAre you mad at me?ELEANORNo.   Are you mad at me?JACEYNo.   Who said I was?ELEANORI did.JACEYI just wanted to talk to you last

                 mad at me you don't have to come.

       She gives him a sultry smile, turns and glides into a
       classroom as the BELL RINGS. The corridor is quickly
       vacated by all but Jacey -- he savors the aftertaste of
       Eleanor's smile.5      EXT. HOLT HOME - EVENING (MAGIC HOUR)                          5ESTABLISHING ANGLE of the modest two-story clapboard
       house in a working class neighborhood. A home-made ping-
       pong table takes up so much room in the detached garage
       that it forced the eviction of the family car, a 1950
       Plymouth coupe, which is parked nearby on the driveway.
       The garage doors are open and the garage light is on.

       We hear (V.O.) DOUG SINGING bits and pieces of
       "Heartbreak Hotel" in his best Elvis fashion.INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96                  3A/4.6   INT. HOLT HOME - BATHROOM - EVENING (MAGIC HOUR)             6Doug stands in front of the bathroom mirror (wearing a
    coat and tie) still singing "Heartbreak Hotel" while he
    carefully draws sideburns on his face with a wide-nib pen
    and a bottle of India ink. Jacey's reflection appears in
    the mirror behind Doug -- he's wearing a coat and tie too.
    Jacey does a pained take on Doug's handiwork:JACEYOh, Christ!7   INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING (MAGIC HOURMINUTES LATER)         7HELEN HOLT is seated at the dining table. She was
    grading a stack of spelling tests with a red pencil when
    Jacey and Doug came in to ask her to adjudicate the
    matter at hand. She is an attractive but unostentatious
    woman without interest in appearing to be anything other
    than what she is: a forty-one-year-old widow raising two
    teenage sons on a school teacher's salary. (She teaches
    second grade at Haley Elementary School.)JACEYHe has to wash it off, Mother.
              You cannot let him go to the party
              unless he washes it off.DOUGIt'll look worse if I wash it.
              It's India ink, it'll turn gray,
              it'll look like dirt.JACEYHe looks like such a clown and he
              doesn't even know it! He doesn't
              get how things work in this town.
              I thought you weren't even going
              to the party?DOUGChanged my mind.HELENDoug, you do understand that you
              may be the only person at this
              party with artificial sideburns?DOUGYeah.HELENYou do understand that your
              sideburns don't look real?

    Doug was hoping they didn't look that phony, but he
    conceals his disappointment and nods:(CONTINUED)INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96                    5.7CONTINUED:                                                           7DOUGYeah.HELENThat they look, really, as though
                 you'd drawn them on?DOUG(swallows, then
                          shrugs)
                 Yeah.

       She looks hard at Doug for a beat, then turns to Jacey.HELENWell, darling, it seems he does
                 understand. Why don't you just go
                 on to the party and ignore Doug.
                 Just have a good time and pretend
                 you don't even...


       Jacey curses under his breath and storms out the front
       door before his mother can finish her sermon.8EXT. ABBOTT HOME/TENT - STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT                    8The curb is lined with parked cars. We hear a dance band
       playing "QUE SERA" and the sounds of the party as Doug
       lopes up the sidewalk sporting his India ink sideburns
       and smoking a cigarette. He flicks the cigarette into
       the street with well-rehearsed ease as he turns and walks
       up the long driveway towards the glowing "big-top" tent.
       Doug trails his hand over Lloyd Abbott's Cadillac,
       caressing it from hood-to-trunk as he ambles by.9INT. ABBOTT HOME/TENT - NIGHT                                        9Doug enters the tent and surveys the gathering -- a
       tuxedoed ten-piece band plays on the bandstand.

       Despite his mother's advice, a nauseated grimace falls
       over Jacey's face when he sees that his younger brother
       has arrived. He is dancing with Eleanor.(CONTINUED)6.9CONTINUED:                                                           9They dance past a group of young men on the sidelines
       (Jacey's senior classmates), they are all edgy with envy,
       waiting like predators for their chance to dance with
       Eleanor.ELEANORI'm going out to the lake
                 tomorrow. Sandy wants to show-off
                 her dad's new boat. Why don't you
                 come?JACEYI have to work.ELEANORWell, I guess you'll just have to
                 write me a letter.JACEYWhat do you mean?ELEANORYou said you wanted to talk to me
                 in private.JACEYI meant... just... we never get a
                 chance to be together, alone, you
                 know?

       STEVE (one of the envious classmates) makes his move and
       cuts in on Jacey and dances away with Eleanor. Jacey
       handles it with aplomb but his true irritation at being
       separated from the object of his desire reveals itself as
       he observes Eleanor flirting with her new dance partner.10       INT. ABBOTT HOME/TENT - BUFFET TABLE - DOUG                  10-- sampling the hors d'oeuvres. He places the ones he
       doesn't like back onto the platter. PAMELA ABBOTT steps
       over to Doug. She is his age (fifteen), the youngest of
       the Abbott girls, and the least stuck-up.PAMELAHi.

                 u                DOUG
                 Hi.

     finger up across the tip of his nose. Doug scowls and
     points at her bust.DOUGCan I borrow a Kleenex?PAMELAGreaser.DOUG(mouth full of
                       food)
               Got any smokes around here?11   INT. ABBOTT HOME - BACK YARD - NIGHT                          11Doug and Pam smoke their cigarettes in the back yard.
     The tent can be seen in the b.g. The band is playing"MONA LISA."DOUGSo, is this Peter guy Alice is
               gonna marry rich?PAMELAOf course. He's one of the Atlas
               Steel Vanlaninghams. Pittsburgh.
               He's a bully.DOUGSo how come Alice's marrying him?PAMELABecause my parents want her to and
               Alice is afraid of my parents.
               It's practically an arranged
               marriage. They think Alice has
               peanut shells for brains or
               something, so they sort of
               suggested that maybe it was time
               to tie the old knot and they sort
               of suggested that Peter was the
               one to do it with.DOUGJeez, no one can be that much of a
               pushover.(CONTINUED)INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96                    8.11     CONTINUED:                                                   11PAMELALook, Alice is the good daughter,
               Eleanor is the bad one, and I'm
               the one who sort of gets off the
               hook. That's just the way it
               works. Which one are you?DOUGYou mean, which kind of brother am
               I? You got me? The little
               brother, I guess.12     INT. ABBOTT HOME/TENT - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER)             12The band improvises a FANFARE as Lloyd Abbott and his
     wife, JOAN ABBOTT, step up onto the bandstand. Joan has
     the practiced poise of a former beauty queen (as if her
     smile had been surgically sewn onto her face). She has a
     tendency to smoke and drink a bit too much and eat and
     sleep a bit too little.LLOYDLadies and Gentlemen -- I'd like
               to propose a toast in honor of our
               cause for celebration tonight --
               the engagement of our daughter,
               Alice, to Mister Peter
               Vanlaningham.

     He gestures to ALICE ABBOTT and her fiance PETER
     VANLANINGHAM. Alice is nineteen, the eldest and the
     prettiest and seemingly most conventional of the three
     sisters. Peter is the scion of a wealthy Pittsburgh
     family. He and his bride-to-be smile and acknowledge the
     applause and AD-LIBBED toasts.

     The band strikes up "I Got the World on a String" and
     Joan whispers something to Alice -- Alice goes over to
     Lloyd and (despite his mock-protest) pulls him out onto
     the dance floor.(CONTINUED)9.12       CONTINUED:                                                    12The guests applaud their uninspired box-step; neither
       father nor daughter appear comfortable at such close
       quarters.13       EXT. ABBOTT HOME - DRIVEWAY & TENT - NIGHT                    13The party is going full swing as Doug wanders out of the
       tent and walks down the driveway. He's had enough of
       high society for tonight.14       EXT. SIDEWALK (HALEY) - NIGHT                                 14Doug strolls along the sidewalk (in a residential
       neighborhood) softly singing "You Ain't Nothin' but a
       Hound Dog." He pauses beside a rubbish can on the curb,
       strikes a wooden match, and sets the trash on fire. As
       he nonchalantly continues down the sidewalk we see
       several trash cans on fire in the near distance.15       EXT. ABBOTT HOME - BACK YARD - NIGHT                          15Eleanor necks with Steve (Jacey's rival) on the glider in
       the gazebo in the distant corner of the yard. The sounds
       of the PARTY can be heard in the b.g. (the band is
       playing "In Old Monterey"). Jacey stands in the shadows
       of the shrubbery spying on them with pure heartache.16       EXT. STREET (HALEY) - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER)                16Jacey walks home with his eyes brimming with bitter tears
       -- past the smoldering rubbish cans along the curb.17       EXT. HOLT HOME - SIDEWALK & GARAGE - NIGHT                    17(MINUTES LATER)As Jacey turns up the driveway, a light snaps on in the
       garage. The garage doors are open, Doug sits on the edge
       of the ping-pong table smoking a cigarette with his hand
       still on the light fixture pull chain.DOUGThree out of five?JACEYTwo out of three. You serve.

       Jacey and Doug pick up their paddles and begin a game of
       ping-pong. They are expert players and fierce
       competitors.INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96                   10.18     EXT. TEXACO GAS STATION (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - NEXT DAY          18Lloyd Abbott pulls his (1957) Cadillac up to the pumps.
     The DING-DING of the BELL HOSE summons Jacey. He wears a
     Texaco uniform complete with bow tie and cap.JACEY'Morning.LLOYDFill 'er up.   Hi-test.

     Jacey sets the pump nozzle on automatic and cleans the
     windshield. Lloyd slips the ashtray out of the dash,
     climbs out of the car, and empties the ashtray in the
     trash can.JACEYThat was a nice party last night.LLOYDYou were there?JACEYYes, sir.   Eleanor invited me.LLOYDDid she? Didn't see you.
                      (slight beat)
               You going to be an engineer like
               your dad was?JACEYI want to be an architect.LLOYDHmmm... I guess some people care
               more about having ideas that they
               do about making money.JACEYI care about making money.

     Lloyd idly examines the mechanism on the ashtray that
     enables it to slide in-and-out of the dash.LLOYDThat full suspension file drawer
               your dad invented is still in
               production, did you know that?
               We'll ship thirty-maybe-forty
               thousand of those file cabinets
               this year. Hell, that drawer put
               Midwest Steel Desk on the map.JACEYYes, sir.   I know.(CONTINUED)11.18      CONTINUED:                                                     18LLOYDAn architect, huh?

      The GAS NOZZLE CLICKS OFF, Jacey hangs up the nozzle, and
      replaces the gas cap. Lloyd pulls out his wallet.LLOYDYou want some free advice?JACEYSure.LLOYDDon't waste your life making other
                people rich. Keep the change.

      He hands Jacey a five-spot and gets into his car. Lloyd
      drives away in his Cadillac. Jacey crumbles the five
      dollar bill into a ball. As he returns to the office he
      catches his reflection in the mirror of the cigarette
      machine. He frowns and pulls off his cap and bow tie.A19     INT. BOATHOUSE (LAKE) - LATER THAT DAY                         A19The abandoned boathouse is a dilapidated structure
      situated on an isolated shore of the large lake. Doug
      strikes a wooden match, shepherds the flame, leans over,
      holds the match to his ass and lights a fart. The
      amorphous blue flame flares and almost instantly
      disappears as the gas is consumed. VICTOR, Doug's
      partner in crime and best friend, is impressed. (Victor
      is fifteen, too.)VICTORJeez Louise!   How'd you do that?DOUGIntestinal gas -- produced by
                bacterial metabolism of food
                residues in the colon. A mixture
                of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon
                dioxide, and methane. That's the
                secret ingredient.VICTORWhat's so secret about it?DOUGNot everyone can produce methane.
                It's genetic, that means it's
                inherited. There's a lot of

      male water skier. (Another young man is    driving the boat

     takes a hard bounce, loses hold of the tow-rope, and goes
     tumbling over the apex of the ramp into the water.20     INT. HOLT HOME - BATHROOM - THAT NIGHT                        20Jacey is soaking in the bathtub.   Doug enters without

     probing eyes.

     He ducks under the table to retrieve his pencil and his
     ruse is revealed as he stares up Eleanor's skirt at the
     soft triangle that her white panties cover between her
     parted legs. Eleanor's hand lowers a piece of notebook
     paper beneath the table, on it she has written: "Hi
     Doug!"

     the bottom of the table, and then, as his head rebounds
     from the blow, he accidentally impales himself in his
     chin with the sharp pencil. Doug scrambles up from under
     the table with the pencil dangling from his chin,
     knocking over his chair in the process. The tranquility
     of the library is destroyed by the flabbergasted
     reactions of the students. Eleanor is momentarily
     concerned about his welfare, but she cannot help but
     laugh, too.23.39     EXT. STREETS OF HALEY - LATER THAT DAY                        39Doug morosely slouches along the sidewalk on his way home

     Doug exhales with bewilderment, stubs out his cigarette,
     then awkwardly slides down the sofa to Pamela. She holds
     perfectly still as Doug slowly moves his mouth to hers
     and kisses her. Then he concludes the kiss to check her
     reaction; she timidly smiles. He kisses her again with
     greater fervor. Doug creeps his hand up her blouse and
     massages her breast. Pamela struggles to suppress her
     surprise, which he mistakes as a sign of her approval.
     Emboldened by her lack of resistance, he slips his hand
     under her bra. Pam is shocked by the pleasure of the
     sensation, then alarmed by the pace of their passion.PAMELADoug...

         He kisses her with such ardor that she   interprets his

         silence her. He pulls his hand out of    her blouse and

     it up and cleans it off with her apron. As she turns to
     go back to the house, she finds Doug standing on the

     Helen sits on the porch steps and now the true toll that
     Joan's visit has taken on Helen becomes apparent -- a
     bone-weary sadness falls over her. Her "tranquility" is
     not borne of happiness, it is only a means of coping with

     The band plays "Fly Me To The Moon." Doug stands apart
     from the others. He's ill-at-ease. His conversation
     with Jacey resonates within him. As he looks over the
     gathering, he's pained to discover how easy it is to see
     things the way Jacey does: Lloyd holding court with a
     group of men in tuxedos... Joan Abbott propelling a
     reluctant Alice towards a group of guests Alice's age
     (Alice and Peter have separated)... and, finally, Pamela
     dancing with a handsome young man (TED). She is the
     belle of the ball, radiant and suddenly mature in her
     beautiful gown. She smiles as she sees Doug, excuses
     herself, and comes over to him.PAMELAHow long have you been here?DOUGA while.PAMELAAre you okay?DOUGI'm fine.    Having fun?PAMELAYes, I am.    Come on, dance with
               me.

     She pulls him towards the dance floor.DOUGYou didn't tell me I had to dance.PAMELAJust one dance and we'll be even.

               For crying out loud. Forget it.PAMELAI accept your apology.   Let's
               dance.

     Doug allows Pam to pull him out onto the dance floor. He
     feels like a dolt, but she arranges his hands on her and
     they begin to dance. She gazes into his eyes and smiles:PAMELAHi.DOUGHi.

     Pam is in love with Doug, she has been since they were
     children. Doug is mellowed by his tender feelings for
     her. For a golden minute they are in pleasurable bubble
     of true affinity. But their bubble begins to deflate as
     Doug sees Joan Abbott staring at them. Her disapproval
     is unmistakable. Doug steers Pam around the dance floor
     to avoid Joan's eyes, but then he sees Lloyd Abbott.
     Lloyd's stare is even more discomforting. Pamela senses
     the change in Doug's mood, but she is unaware of the
     cause.PAMELAIs Jacey home for the summer or is
               he just here for a visit?

     The mention of his brother's name at this exact moment

               Jacey working summers, my mom had

               where the money'll come from for
               me to go to college.

     dance with Pamela. Doug's bitterness swells.DOUGI hear Alice and Peter are getting
               a divorce.PAMELAThey're just separated.DOUGWhat's the difference?PAMELAI don't know, you'll have to ask

     Ted steps over and taps Doug on the shoulder.DOUGFuck off.

     Ted is taken aback.   Pamela's eyes fill with tears.PAMELAWhy do you hate me so much?TEDExcuse me, asshole, but...

     Doug spins and slugs Ted in the jaw -- sending him
     reeling into the other dancers. Everyone pulls away from
     Doug and Pam. Doug massages his fist and looks
     helplessly at Pamela:DOUGI don't hate you.70     INT. HOLT HOME - DOUG'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT            70The hall light is on but the bedroom is dark. Doug lies

       Jacey skillfully manipulates the volley and wins the game
       with a savage return that Doug is unable to counter.
       Jacey smiles, puts his paddle down, and walks out of the
       garage. Doug quickly picks up a ping-pong ball and hits
       it into the back of Jacey's head. Jacey turns and shoots

       forgets the cold as he sees Pam and three of her girl
       friends come out of the drugstore across the street. The
       girls are in high spirits as they get into Pam's car.

       Two well-dressed townswomen (MURIEL and DORIS) encounter
       Helen on their way into the apparel shop as she steps out
       onto the sidewalk.HELENHello, Muriel... Doris.

       The women pass by Helen with obvious reserve. Helen is

     Pamela rises from her seat and takes her diploma.

     Lloyd and Joan Abbott applaud their daughter. Joan
     stands to take a snapshot. Alice is occupied with her
     restless and fussy eighteen-month-old daughter, Susan.

     Doug watches Pam return to her seat; she avoids his eyes.

     Helen is all smiles, this is a very special day for her.
     The chair next to her is empty. She glances behind her
     and sees Jacey standing in the back of the gym.

     Jacey idly surveys the gathering with irritable boredom.
     He is only there at his mother's insistence. His eyes
     settle on... Alice Abbott.

     Alice tries to quiet her CRYING eighteen-month-old
     daughter (SUSAN). Lloyd makes a reprimanding aside to
     Alice and she rises and carries Susan up the aisle.

     Jacey's eyes follow Alice -- she notices his stare as she
     passes by with Susan in her arms.77     EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - LATER THAT DAY                77Commencement is over -- the parking lot is a sea of cars

     ambushed by three (second grade) students of hers. She

     They pass each other and head their separate ways.   Their
     chance meeting has not gone unobserved:

     Joan Abbott has been watching them from the front seat of
     Lloyd's brand-new 1959 Cadillac. She pretends to repair
     her lipstick with her compact mirror as Lloyd slips
     behind the wheel.

     And Helen finds Jacey frowning at her. He opens the door
     so that she can get into the Plymouth (Doug is already in
     the back seat). Jacey glares at Lloyd as he walks around
     the car and gets in behind the wheel.

     Lloyd flips down his sun visor (to block Jacey's glare)
     and pulls out of his parking spot.78     INT. IRON SKILLET RESTAURANT - THAT NIGHT                     78A waitress walks across the busy diner to Helen, Jacey,

     banner on the tent proclaims). The street is lined with
     parked cars and busy with late-coming guests.

     She sails into combat with her broom swinging. But Doug

     finally separated by a strong blast of water. They
     sputter for breath and discover that Helen is holding the

     picks up a ping-pong paddle and bounces the ball on it,
     trying to see how long he can keep it bouncing. Jacey
     finishes cleaning up, picks up a paddle, and then,
     without a word, Doug serves the ball and they begin to
     volley.53.87     EXT. ROAD (COUNTRYSIDE) - DAY                                  87The Plymouth drives along the two-lane blacktop past the
     fields of tall, green corn. Doug is driving, Helen sits
     beside him. She reacts to something in the distance:HELENIsn't that Pamela Abbott?

     In the distance Pamela struggles with a jack as she tries
     to remove a flat tire on her convertible.

     Doug grimaces as he recognizes her.HELENIt is Pam.    Pull over.

     Doug reluctantly pulls over beside Pam's car. She's no
     more pleased to see Doug than he is to see her.HELENHi, Pam.   Do you need some help?PAMELAHi, Mrs. Holt. It's so darn hot

              Then you were born. And Jacey
              just got lost in there. I didn't
              have anything for him. Mother
              took him over. He'd cry or call

              started dropping by on his way
              home from work. He felt so bad
              about that bet Charlie made with
              him at the lake. That foolish,
              idiotic bet. Poor Lloyd -- I felt
              sorry for him. He'd have a cup of
              coffee with Mother and me. If a
              doorknob had come off he'd fix it.
              He'd carry the garbage cans to the
              curb. Someone dies, people try to
              be helpful. But he was by here so
              often that people started to talk.
              It was fairly obvious that he
              wanted something more from me than
              just a cup of coffee. I suggested
              that he didn't need to stop by
              here so often, but... then one
              afternoon I was at Woolworth's,
              having lunch at the counter. All
              of sudden Joan Abbott was standing

      the ENGINE but doesn't get out of the car. Then he
      STARTS the CAR again and backs out of the driveway.172     INT. ABBOTT HOME - TENT - DAY (SHORT TIME LATER)                172Despite it being a birthday party for a three-year-old,

                to show you how stupid this town
                is -- that they'd believe she
                slept with me. That'd make
                Charlie laugh. Your old man was

                I mean... for Christ's sake, she
                never blamed me for what happened
