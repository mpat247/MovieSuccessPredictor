                                Lorenzo Semple Jr.FADE IN:EXT. WIDE AFRICAN LANDSCAPE - MORNINGAt first only darkness, then the rising sun paints in an
          endless savanna from horizon to horizon. We hear savage drums
          beating in the distance coming from some unknown place.
                         
          The sun clears the horizon. Suddenly it changes amazingly:
          the white disc goes through a rapid series of color
          transitions, from yellow to green to purple to an incredible
          BLOOD RED. From it shoots a RED LIGHTNING BOLT.
                         
          The sky echoes with THUNDER.
                         
          We hear a HOWLING ethereal wind, but not a twig of the brush
          stirs as bolt after bolt of RED LIGHTNING rips the sky, with
          each one a TITLE or CREDIT appearing.
                         
          Under FINAL CREDIT snow is beginning to fall on the burning
          blood-red savanna.EXT. PLANE IN FLIGHT - DAYI's a Twin Otter with the logo of some commuter airline. It
          buzzes along over pleasant countryside, through a sky that's
          almost unnaturally serene and filled with fleecy white clouds.INT. PLANE IN FLIGHT - DAYThere are just two passengers in the cabin. One is DALE ARDEN,
          a great looking dark-haired girl sitting by herself and
          reading a book entitled "KARATE FOR THE SINGLE GIRL.... A
          Guide to Survival In The City." A few rows forward, near the
          open door into the pilots' compartment, is FLASH GORDON.
          He's studying a football play-sheet, one of those diagrammed
          things with X's and 0's for the players and dotted-line arrows
          indicating the directions of movement.
                         
          Suddenly the plane makes a violent bump. It almost knocks
          the book from DALE'S hand. She looks out the window with
          sudden fright, tossing hair out of her eyes, in a gesture
          that's habitual to her in moments of stress.
                         
          There's nothing to see outside but the pretty clouds. She
          looks forward again and watches FLASH standing up easily,
          leaning in t..e cockpit doorway to speak to the PILOTS.INT. PLANE/ COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS(CO-P:ILOT, DALE, FLASH, PILOT)FLASHWhat was that, fellas?2.PILOTClear-air turbulence, is all. NothingSERIOUSCO-PILOTBut nothing you'd want to toss a

           Mr. Gordon?FLASHSure -- my pleasure.
                         
          As FLASH takes a bit of paper from the CO-PILOT, the plane
          takes another jolt, even more violent than the first.PILOTWow. Call Westchester Approach, see
           what they've got.FLASHI sure hope we don't have to turn
           back. I mean this is first day of
           training camp, I wouldn't want to beLATE --PILOTSeat-belt time.
                         
          FLASH starts back to his seat. The plane jumps again, shudders
          violently. He holds on, calls up front:FLASHMaybe it'd be smoother if you wentHIGHER --DALEWill you SHUT UP?
           (as FLASH's headSWIVELS)Look, Mister Flash Gordon, they have
           their hands full -- just let 'em
           drive.INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS(DALE, FLASH)The plane buffets. FLASH is sent reeling, catches hold of
          the rack above DALE, lowers himself into the seat next to
          her. He buckles fast, takes out a candy bar and offers it
          to her.3.FLASHWhen you're nervous, it can help to
           chew on somethingDALEThanks a lot -- I look dumb enough
           to take candy from a stranger?FLASHI'm not a stranger exactly -- You
           know my name.DALEWho doesn't. Number one draft pick,

           it's crazy of me to hate flying --
           I'm a travel agent, you see? -- I've
           just been checking out a little hotel
           in Vermont -- can I still have that
           candy bar?
           (and in the same breath)
           Are we going backward?FLASHBackwards?DALE (GASP)Holy cow! Look at the clouds!EXT. SKY - POV FROM PLANE WINDOW - DAYThe pretty white clouds are changing above and beginning to
          surround the airplane. Over the engines we HEAR that same
          ethereal wind rising which we heard in the opening. Slowly
          and terrifyingly, the sun starts turning BLOOD RED. The clouds
          race faster, faster, until they are actually streaming past
          the plane from behind.INT. PLANE - DAYFLASH and DALE -- faces bathed in the eerie light. Speechless-
          DALE grasps the football player's hand with all her strength.EXT. A FANTASTIC GREENHOUSE - DAYIt is a huge and rambling, antique, standing in semiruinous
          isolation in a pretty country landscape. The sun has turned4.the SAME BLOOD RED we saw from the airplane, and clouds race
          across it with unnatural velocity.
                         
          In the center of the greenhouse rises a glass-paned tower
          through which we glimpse something MIRROR BRIGHT. Floating
          high in the air above the structure are several silvery helium-
          filled balloons, secured by wires. As we move closer, we
          discern a MAN moving about actively on a platform inside the
          central tower, about half-way up:INT. GREENHOUSE TOWER - DAY(MUNSON, TV NEWSMAN, ZARKOV)The man is DR. HANS ZARKOV: big, bearded, feverish looking
          and seemingly half mad with exhaustion. In striking contrast
          to the antique greenhouse exterior, here there are all kinds
          of computers and displays connected together in a slapdash
          fashion. Quantities of neglected plants, most brown and
          dead or dying, hide the works in here from outside view. As
          Zarkov runs around throwing switches and eyeing displays, a
          grim-voiced TV. NEWSMAN is appearing and speaking from a
          good-sized television screen above the main control console:TV NEWSMANThe extraordinary weather disturbances
           reported from Africa this morning
           are now crossing the Atlantic, and
           are expected to reach the East Coast
           of the United States by noon.
           According to scientists at NASA, the
           Earth is being struck by an immense
           stream of cosmic energy, apparently
           the result of some catastrophic
           stellar accident beyond the reachesOF --ZARKOV whirls, slams the TV SOUND OFF and yells at the
          silently mouthing NEWSMAN on the screen.ZARKOVFools! Can't you understand? This
           is no accident-- it's an ATTACK! An
           attack planned by a MIND! This isATTACK!MUNSON, a scared looking assistant, comes running up the
          stairs with a computer print-out sheet.MUNSONDr. Zarkov! Look at the report from
           the last balloon!
                         
          ZARKOV grabs it, eyes it.5.ZARKOVI predicted it, didn't I?MUNSONYes, sir -- you sure did. And this
           funny sun too ---ZARKOVOzone layer starting to crack up.
           By tonight Carbon dioxide will be
           combining with free nitrogen to form --
           (breaks off, crumplingTHE SHEET)Well, this is it.MUNSONSir, the President is on the TV behindYOU --ZARKOVWhat the hell do I care? I tried to
           warn him -- he called me mad, like
           all the others.
                         
          BOOM! The TV screen EXPLODES in a fine shower of glass.ZARKOV (CONT'D)Time for us to go, Munson. Get your
           toothbrush and whatever.MUNSONGo where?ZARKOVUp. Up and at him.
                         
          Stunned, MUNSON turns his head and glances at something big
          and MIRROR BRIGHT gleaming behind foliage in center of tower.MUNSONYou're crazy!
                         
          Perfectly calm except for the maniacal glint in his eyes,
          ZARKOV pulls out a revolver and points it at MUNSON.ZARKOVI can't handle the capsule alone get
           your toothbrush.INT. COCKPIT TO SKY - POV(CO-PILOT, PILOT)The PILOTS watch these clouds also, transfixed with disbelief.
          They speak with that incredible calmness characteristic of
          professional airmen in a moment of impending catastrophe.6.PILOTWhat's ,e word from Westchester
           Approach, Bill?CO-PILOTZip. All chanels dead.

           Say, get a load of the VOR's....
                         
          The directional needles are going crazy. All the instruments
          are going crazy. Displays flash impossible symbols. The
          PILOT gapes at them a moment, then returns his gaze to the
          sky and swallows.PILOTOn the left, about six o'clock
           high......
                         
          The racing stream of clouds is parting open like in some
          surreal painting. From the cortex LASER-like bolts of RED
          LIGHTNING shoot out. Like a missile, one zaps right over the
          plane's nose with a horrible crackling NOISE.PILOT (CONT'D)Hold on tight, let's put baby down
           right here......
                         
          The CO-PILOT reaches up and hits the flap control. There is
          a whooshing crackling ZAP! The whole cockpit FLARES OUT
          with an intolerable blinding flash of RED LIGHT.INT. PASSENGER CABIN - CONTINUOUSThe cockpit door flys off its hinges, admitting a gale of
          wind that scatters FLASH'S play sheets like autumn leaves.
          FLASH unsnaps his belt, leaps up and races forward.INT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS(DALE, FLASH)The TWO PILOTS are gone, vanished without trace. Wind from
          the shattered windows assaults FLASH as he charges in. He
          stumbles forward as the plane noses into a dive. Recovering
          he scrambles into the left-hand seat, grabs hold of the
          bucking wheel yoke, pulls back and kicks at the rudder pedals.
          DALE lurches in against the tornado.DALECan you fly it?FLASHI can fly all right -- I've had a
           couple of lessons! -- just don't if
           I can land!(MORE)7.FLASH (CONT'D)(FIGHTING CONTROLS)Grab that other wheel! Help me pull
           her up!
                         
          DALE staggers into the co-pilot's seat, pulls back on the
          wheel in front of her.DALEOh boy! Ever hear about the man who
           fell ninety stories from a window
           and didn't break a bone?FLASHNo but I'd sure like to! How'd The
           man fall ninety stories didn't break
           a bone?DALEThe window was ninety-one stories
           up!SHOOTING FORWARD - THROUGH THE BROKEN WINDSHIELDThe Earth is approaching fast, wheeling and tilting. We get
          a glimpse of a strange greenhouse structure at the end of a
          flat area.
                         
          Another barrage of crackling RED LIGHTNING BOLTS shoot all
          around the plane but just miss it.INT. COCKPIT(FLASH)FLASHBrace yourself I'm aiming at that
           field up ahead!EXT. ZARKOV'S GREENHOUSE - DAY(ZARKOV'S VOICE)Its thousands of panes reflect the RED SUN and the RED BOLTS
          which rain down in intermittent bursts. One strikes an end
          of a gallery, exploding glass and foliage. From inside, we
          HEAR a furious echoing VOICE:ZARKOV'S VOICEI see you, Munson! Come out or I
           shoot!8.INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY(MUNSON, ZARKOV)ZARKOV is on the lower stairs of the tower, aiming his
          revolver. MUNSON emerges from some dry brown bush where he
          was hiding.MUNSONSo what's it matter if I'm shot or
           go up in that thing? I'm a goner
           either way, right?ZARKOVOf course -- I admit that! But this
           way you'll be giving your life for a
           chance of saving Earth! Haven't you
           any spirit at all??MUNSONGoodbye, Doctor -- they were all
           right about you. Have a nice trip.
                         
          MUNSON starts walking away, toward the door at the end of
          the long side wing.ZARKOVI tell you I can't take it off alone!
           If you won't come, who will I find?
                         
          If you woo't come, who will I find:
                         
          MUNSON ignores him totally, keeps walking away. ZARKOV lifts
          his revolver and draws a bead on the man's back. Just as he
          is about to shoot, he reacts to something outside.EXT. GREENHOUSEAmazingly, a Twin Otter is gliding in to a horribly rough
          landing in the field outside. The plane hits on one wheel,
          bounces into the air, comes down again and keeps right on
          rolling toward the greenhouse.AS ABOVE - FEATURE MUNSONSEEING the onrushing plane, freezing an instant then starting
          to run. He hardly gets five yards before the Twin Otter comes
          SLAMMING IN through the greenhouse wall, burying MUNSON
          totally under the wreckage.INT. COCKPIT - DAY(DALE, FLASH)Crazily angled, filled with dust and smoke. Dazed, blood on
          his forehead, FLASH struggles from his seat.9.FLASHDale! Are you all right?DALEI'm terrific.(WEAK SMILE)Flash Gordon, you have just made me
           a Giant fan for life.FLASHCome on -- let's get out before she
           blows!
                         
          FLASH helps her from the wrecked seat, wheels and kicks out
          the emergency exit in the cockpit area.INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY(DALE, FLASH, ZARKOV)FLASH lowers DALE to the ground, jumps down after her. ZARKOV
          is there, smiling at them in a strange way.FLASHHello. i'm Flash Gordon, this is
           Miss Dale Arden --ZARKOV(MEANS IT)Delighted to see you.FLASHThis crazy storm knocked us down
           could we use a phone?ZARKOVCertainly. Just follow me -- up those
           stairs.FLASHSome weather huh?ZARKOVIt will get worse.
                         
          ZARKOV turns and smiles at them again as they start up the
          tower stairs. SUddenly DALE stops short, staring at ZARKOV
          with a funny expression.DALEYou're Dr. Hans Zarkov!
                         
          ZARKOV hesitates just an instant, the nods.ZARKOVHow did you know?10.DALEI saw you in PEOPLE mag. After you
           left NASA, remember? It said you
           were utterly ---
                         
          DALE breaks off, almost biting her tongue.ZARKOVInsane? Off my rocker?DALEI forget what it said:(TURNING HASTILY)Flash, let's find some other phone,
           okay? I'm sure Dr. Zarkov is very
           busy.......
                         
          FLASH is baffled, but he gets her urgent look.FLASHWell, all right -- but it seems to
           me we ought to --
                         
          Now it's FLASH'S turn to break off. ZARKOV is pointing a
          gun at him.ZARKOVUp the stairs to the tower! Ahead
           of me -- quick! --
           (as they gape at him,FROZEN)Quick I said: We haven't much time --
           Earth is being attacked! -- there's
           only one slim chance of saving it!FLASHMister, you are insane!
                         
          HOWL of ether-wind increases. Storm of RED LASER BOLTS. Glass
          showers them as parts of the green house EXPLODE and dry
          foliage bursts into FLAME.ZARKOVUp the stairs -- RUN!
                         
          ZARKOV jabs the revolver into DALE'S back. RED BOLTS zap
          around. FLASH whispers to her as they start running up ahead
          of ZARKOV.FLASHGo with the flow -- wait for a chance!
                         
          Below them, bottom of staircase disintergrates in a RED FLASH.11.INT. TOP LEVEL OF GREENHOUSE TOWER(DALE, FLASH, ZARKOV)ZARKOV rips away a screen of foliage, revealing a MIRROR
          BRIGHT capsule, seamless but for one door. He yanks that
          open.
                         
          On every side things are blowing up and burning under the
          merciless rain of bolts. One strikes the capsule head on,
          but does not even leave a mark.ZARKOVI need your help to take off! Get
           in or I shot you dead!
                         
          DALE gasps and shrinks back.FLASHTake off for where?ZARKOVGod only knows -- whatever black
           corner of space this is coming from --
           wherever HE is!. -- we'll plunge
           into the devil's heart and destroy

           tours -- never.
                         
          FLASH is poised to jump, but ZARKOV suddenly pushes DALE off-
          balance, INTO the capsule. FLASH leaps after her.INT. CAPSULE(DALE, ZARKOV)It is curiously transparent from the inside, mirrored only
          on the exterior. There are some controls and displays, but
          in general the interior is severely ascetic: as far removed
          from conventional spacecraft as ZARKOV's solitary genius is
          from everyday science.
                         
          Immediately starting to set switches in a frenzy of activity,
          ZARKOV waves the gun at FLASH.ZARKOVSit down there! Foot on the red pedal!DALEFlash! Sack him!12.ZARKOV wheels and pulls the door shut. FLASH jumps him. He
          punches ZARKOV in the gut. ZARKOV slams him back with the
          well-known strength of a madman. FLASH clobbers him again.
          Falling, ZARKOV dives sidewards and hits a switch.
                         
          The capsule WHINES SOFTLY and begins to WHIRL. Looking out
          through the transparent wall, it is as if the capsule itself
          was motionless and the scene outside is whirling. What's
          left of the greenhouse is under a constant rain of those
          LASER BOLTS, flashing fire that makes us dizzy.
                         
          FLASH staggers to his feet and finds DALE, folds his arms
          around her protectively. The centrifugal force is rapidly
          increasing now, throws them both against the wall. Faster
          and faster, whirling, the force presses DALE'S body back
          against FLASH'S until they are almost one flesh.
                         
          We move over and find ZARKOV plastered against another part
          of the whirling capsule, his face drained white and distorted
          by the terrific G-Force operating here now, his lips moving
          as he speaks with enormous effort:ZARKOV,Friendship...Built this to send to
           them in...Friendship...The end
           now...End of the world....Unless we����(every sound an effortNOW)Unless...We...Three...Can...
                         
          ZARKOV'S eyes close. He loses consciousness.EXT. GREENHOUSE - LONG SHOT (MINIATURE)Totally ablaze within now, one huge fantastic jewel of fire.
          The whole central tower explodes outward. From the inferno a
          MIRROR-BRIGhT capsule slowly rises, hovers, begins picking
          up speed again as it ascends.EXT. CAPSULE IN FLIGHTWhirling, whirling, invincibly unharmed by the LASER BOLTS
          which glance off it again and again, accelerating up into
          space.EXT. CAPSULE IN FLIGHT - POVThe EARTH recedes below into a ball, RED-HUED' under the
          fantastic sun. A fast approaching light FLARES up against
          the mirrored surface and is recognised as our MOON. It flashes
