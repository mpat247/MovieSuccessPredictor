               The screen remains dark for a moment.

               In the darkness WE HEAR the film's THEME MUSIC - a gentle 
               whirring purring noise. Nothing to be alarmed about. It 
               might be a small contented motor.FADE IN:EXT. A DESERTED STREET - NIGHTLONG SHOT of the solitary figure of a WOMAN standing 
               professionally alone at the end of the street.

               It is a bright, still night. We can HEAR the Woman whistling 
               'Stardust' merrily to herself.

               CAMERA TRACKS around her. A Man's footsteps are overlaid.

               We HEAR the Man start to whistle 'Stardust' under his breath - 
               haltingly at first, then in time with the Woman.

               As we approach, she glances at us over her shoulder - then 
               turns round for a better look.

               Her whistling stops - so, at the same moment, does the 
               man's.

               CLOSE SHOT of DORA - a plump, attractive brunette - still 
               young enough to need two glances at the customers.

               She smiles at us - and is pleased with the reception. She 
               hesitates for a long moment, weighing us up carefully... 
               and then - half defiantly, half expecting to be laughed 
               at.DORAIt'll be two quid...

               Evidently we have two quid.  

               She beams with relief - throws her fur over her shoulders, 
               jerks her head towards the right - and sets off.

               CAMERA TRACKS after her.  Overlaid is the sound of the 
               man's footsteps.

               She changes her tune to 'Goodnight Sweetheart'... and so - 
               under his breath - does the Man who is following her.  

               A woman with hair like a two-toned car comes down the 
               stairs, winks at Dora - looks at us for a moment with great 
               curiosity... winks... then passes out of camera.

               CAMERA HOLDS ON Dora - she is staring at something with 
               great curiosity.

               It turns quickly to bewilderment - and the bewilderment to 
               fear. She steps back from CAMERA - but CAMERA won't have 
               it.

               Dora is now staring at something in horror - she opens her 
               mouth to scream - a shadow falls across her face.

               We can SEE the back of a Man's head as he bends intently 
               over a projector. He is watching Dora on the screen. He is 
               breathing quickly.

               We see Dora's hips waggling their way home.

               The Man raises his head, so that we cannot see the screen.

               When he lowers it again, we see the Woman with the two-
               toned hair winking at Dora... then we see Dora throwing 
               her fur onto a chair - and turning towards us.

               WE SEE her staring at something in bewilderment... then 
               backing away from CAMERA in fear.

               WE HEAR the Man breathing as if at the end of a very long 
               race.

               shaft of light is trained onto them.

               Overlaid is a gentle, whirring sound.

               CAMERA PANS quickly to a nearby tree.

               Through the half-open door we catch a glimpse of a second 
               Girl (LORRAINE). She is staring out of a window, her back

               CLOSE SHOT of Milly. She is on a couch, lying on her stomach 
               at a slightly oblique angle. All that WE CAN SEE are her

               CLOSE SHOT of Lorraine. We watch her in profile as she 
               stares out of the window - clutching her shawl. She has 
               outstandingly beautiful features. 

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He is standing by the side of the 
               camera, studying us thoughtfully. He is holding a remote-
               control switch panel in his hand. He clicks off several 
               lights and then switches several others on... then he ducks 
               back under the hood.MILLYThere he goes again! What have you 
                         got under there? A girlfriend?

               We join Mark under the hood.  

               WE SEE a small INVERTED IMAGE of Milly on the ground-glass. 
               Her shoulders are now white and glistening, her spine 
               caressed by shadows. She is staring into the camera.MILLYI suppose you have a girlfriend?

               He adjusts the focus. We can see more clearly the contempt 
               on Milly's face.MARKNo, Milly.MILLYHear that, Lorraine? He's available.

               From Milly's POV WE SEE Mark come round to the front of 
               the camera, and insert a dark slide.MARKRaise your head, please - and look

                         isn't it?MARKYes, Milly.

               He inserts another slide.MILLYWell, what do you do for a living?MARKTake pictures.

               He presses the bulb - the shutters click.MILLYThis sort?MARKNo, Milly.

               He inserts another slide.MILLYDon't you like this sort?MARKNo, Milly.

               He presses the bulb - the shutters click.MILLYWell what sort do you like?

               Mark looks at her thoughtfully for a long moment.MARKI may show you - one day.MILLYThat'll be a treat, I'm sure.

               Mark smiles at her shyly.MARKThat's all, Milly.MILLYOh no, sonny! Now take one I can 
                         show my mother.

               Mark inserts another slide.MARKThink of her then.

               There is a gentle KNOCK at the door, and Mr. Peters enters.

               Lorraine turns round.  

               The left side of her face is classical in its beauty. She 
               has a hare lip, which twists and distorts the whole of the 
               right side. Her eyes are large - and beautiful - and 
               defiant.

               her face. Over her shoulder we watch a party in progress. 
               A group of Young people have surrounded someone to whom 
               they are singing:YOUNG PEOPLE(singing)

               CLOSE SHOT of the glass by Mrs. Stephens' side. It is half 
               empty. An elderly lady leans across to her. She is Mrs.

                         daughter, Mrs. Stephens.

               Mrs. Stephens grunts. Someone switches on a gramophone and 
               the young couples start dancing at once. Tony hurries up 
               to Helen.TONYMay I?

               Helen goes towards him. A YOUNG MAN calls out sharply:YOUNG MANLook!

               He is pointing at something out of camera. All heads - 
               except Mrs. Stephens' - follow the direction of his gaze.  
               Mrs. Stephens continues to sit motionless in the high-backed 
               chair.

               From his POV WE SEE Helen's eyes looking at him - the key 
               of the door in them - looking at him, not staring. Suddenly 
               the rest comes into focus - Tony's arm around Helen's 
               shoulder... the high-backed chair in the foreground with 
               the back of that motionless head... a young couple giggling 
               as they stare at him. Mark steps away, and the CAMERA PULLS 
               BACK with him.

               We catch a glimpse of the house - large, sprawling, but 
               with a touch of quality about it, in a quiet, unpretentious 
               street.

               WE FOLLOW Mark (and his camera) along a small passage which

               Mark starts to whistle it under his breath.INT. HALL - NIGHTOver his shoulder we see a staircase, and beyond it the 
               door of Helen's sitting room. The sound of Helen's party 
               fills the hall.

               Mark reaches the staircase. There is the sound of a door 
               opening. Helen's voice is overlaid:HELEN (O.S.)Excuse me!

               Mark hesitates, then turns round.

                         least to say hello to you! So hello!

               Her directness is natural, consistent and very hard to

               Mark leans forward, watching the screen intently... 
               Perspiration trickles down his forehead. He is breathing 
               very quickly. The sounds of the party seep up from 
               downstairs - music, laughter, and a Girl's yelp.

               There is a knock on the door. Mark does not hear it.

               in darkness. A dark-room darkness.INT. THE INNER ROOM - NIGHTWe can HEAR - faintly ï¿½ the dance music from downstairs.  
               There is a click - and the walls are suddenly bathed in 
               diffused light, throwing the room into delicate shadow. 

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking round in amazement.

               As certain events of possible interest are to take place 
               in this room, here, in detail, is what amazes Helen.

               The room is the product of three rooms which have been 
               knocked into one. It is very large and extremely well 
               constructed (as we are soon to learn, it was originally a 
               laboratory). One half of the room is used for processing, 
               and the other half for filming - and for trade shows. The 
               two halves are lined by long shelves upon which are perched 
               all shapes and sizes of cameras, their spectacles glinting 
               in the light.

               In the processing half two benches (a 'dry' bench and a 
               'wet' bench) face each other against opposite walls. There 
               are three sinks above the 'wet' bench and an outburst of 
               equipment above the 'dry'.

               This part of the room is lit by two dark-room lamps frowning 
               in the ceiling above the benches.

               The other part of the room has a window at the far end of 
               it. Heavy drapes are putted across it.

               Mark's projector rests on a small table in front of the 
               16mm screen.  Two banks of floods and a variety of spots 
               light this part of the room. There is a small control panel 
               on the wall.  

               Some of the equipment is ancient - but none of it is old. 
               All of it glistens with the affection of its owner.

               There is absolutely nothing in the room to alarm anyone 
               except an adult... the kind who starts to wonder who paid 
               for it all.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He stands by the lighting panel, 
               watching Helen.

               From his POV WE SEE her brushing the hair out of her eyes 
               as she looks slowly round. He brushes the hair out of his. 
               For a moment she turns her back to him. He presses a switch 
               on the wall. A gentle light ripples through the back of 
               Helen's hair.

               SHOT of Helen. She turns to him. She is very nearly at a 
               loss for words.HELENThis is so... well - so many 
                         things... but above all - it's 
                         so...

               She takes a final look round.HELEN...completely unexpected! 

               She looks at him searchingly.HELENIs all of it yours?MARKYes.HELENI mean... is it designed by you?

               He crosses to the corner cupboard - opens the door.

               CLOSE SHOT of the cupboard.  WE SEE Mark's hand reach for

               REVERSE ANGLE SHOT of Mark. He closes the cupboard, and 
               turns round... there is a spool of film in his hand.

               He walks slowly towards his projector... he seems ï¿½ for 
               the moment ï¿½ to have forgotten she is there.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen - watching him thread the film into

               down.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He looks at her intently for a moment - 
               then turns off the lights. Over Helen's shoulder We can 
               just make out the empty screen. Mark switches on the 
               projector.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark staring at Helen's face.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen. WE SEE her expression of surprise. 
               Over Mark's shoulder WE SEE the surprise growing. Over 
               Helen's shoulder we see the screen. We are looking at a 
               small boy. He is lying in his bed asleep. Although the 
               print is old, we can see that he is a remarkably handsome 
               boy.HELENMark, what a beautiful child.

               The boy turns restlessly in his sleep... one of his pillows

               She is so perpetually drunk as almost to be sober. The few 
               movements she makes are slow - deliberate - and give nothing 
               away. The voice articulates so carefully that the slur

               The fact that she is blind almost helps to conceal the

               Over Helen's shoulder WE SEE the lizard reach the 
               counterpane. It stretches itself out on the floral design - 
               its body is pointed towards the child's hand.

               WE HEAR a click - and suddenly a spotlight falls onto 
               Helen's face.

               there is no sign of the lizard.

               A handkerchief is thrown onto the boy's bed. He continues 
               crying - looking up into someone's face.

               Mark puts the cine-camera and the black cloth bag on the 
               dolly, slowly mounts the platform, closes the blimp - and 
               swings the camera.

               We watch him from the top of the studio, from the door of 
               the studio, from the Director's chair. And finally WE WATCH 
               HIM from Vivian's POV. She stops dancing but the music 
               continues.MARKYou belong there...  

               He stares ahead of him, his mind far, far away... then 
               bends and looks into the finder.  

               There is a single harsh chord of music - and the screen 
               goes dark. It remains dark for a moment.

               Suddenly the darkness parts like curtains - and in the 
               centre WE SEE Vivian's face in the finder of the studio

               Mark hooks a filler-light below the camera and switches it 
               on. He adjusts the finder until he has made of Vivian's 
               delicate features a radiant miniature.

               The miniature smiles shyly at him. She has stopped dancing 
               and is looking directly at the camera. Music continues.VIVIANI do feel alone in front of it...

               gradually Vivian, too, becomes aware of it.VIVIANWell? What is it?

               Just for a moment Mark's arm moves. His back hides what he

               Vivian raises her hands to push something away from her.  

               Suddenly the screen is filled with her eyes. WE SEE them

               There is a scream in the darkness.

               The door of the small room opens, and the Crew-member comes 
               out.CREW-MEMBERYou, Mark?MARKThanks...

               He rises slowly... the cine-camera is over his shoulder.CLAPPER BOYMark, hadn't you better leave that

               He walks slowly towards the door.

               starts to read it.INT. SMALL OFFICE - DAYThe Inspector is seated at a desk, reading some notes. The 
               Sergeant is seated by the side of the desk, a pile of papers 
               in front of him.

               From his POV WE SEE a young man with a camera over his 
               shoulder advancing shyly towards him.INSPECTORMr. Lewis?MARKYes, sir...INSPECTORI'm Chief Inspector Gregg and this 
                         is Sergeant Miller. Grab a chair.

                         you want to take the film away.

               He holds out his camera.  The Sergeant glances enquiringly 
               at the Inspector.INSPECTORThat's all right, Mr. Lewis - as 
                         long as we don't appear at the

               From the Sergeant's POV WE SEE Mark turn to go into the 
               passage.

               The Sergeant stares at the camera on his shoulder... then 
               the door closes.

               The Sergeant makes a note on a piece of paper.INT. PASSAGE - DAYThe Inspector and Mark walk side by side along the passage. 
               The Clapper Boy comes into view - still reading Sight and 
               Sound.

               The Clapper Boy glances up - just in time to see the 
               Inspector and Mark walk side by side to the end of the 
               corridor.CLAPPER BOY(staring after them)

               barring the entrance.INSPECTORI think I can find my way now...

               Mark smiles.INSPECTOR...thanks for the escort

               The Inspector hurries towards the door of the set. 

               The Constable opens it - and the Inspector goes inside. 

               The Constable closes the door - and stands in front of it. 

               Mark turns away quickly.DISSOLVE TO:EXT. COURTYARD - DAYThe carpark is jammed with cars - but there is hardly anyone 
               in sight. Mark hurries towards the large sliding doors of 
               Stage E - they are a few feet apart. He looks round 
               carefully, then slips inside.INT. STAGE E. - DAYFacing Mark is the darkened set of an hotel bedroom. Beyond 
               this is another set - also in darkness - and beyond this 
               yet another. Only in the far comer of the studio - in the 
               furthermost set - is there a light burning. Voices can 
               faintly be heard coming from this set. 

               Mark walks quietly towards a long ladder which leads up to 
               the gantry. Carefully - rung by rung - he starts to climb 
               the ladder. At the top of the ladder is a gallery. Mark 
               moves along the maze of bridges until he is nearly above 
               the Policemen.

               Mark raises his head cautiously - and looks down.

               Far below WE CAN SEE the Inspector standing next to the 
               Doctor - a tall, silver haired man - who is peering into 
               an open trunk. Detectives are photographing the set. Mark 
               raises his cine-camera... its gentle purring seems to echo 
               round the studio.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark's jacket pocket. A row of pencils is 
               sticking out. As he leans forward the pencils tilt. 

               Through the finder-matte of Mark's camera WE SEE the 
               Inspector - very far away - peering into the trunk and 
               nodding.

               A faint echo of conversation is overlaid.DOCTOR (O.S.)No doubt at all... wounds were 
                         caused by the same instrument...

               Mark changes lens (and alters the finder to a 75mm lens). 
               The Doctor's face - thin and impersonal - appears in the 
               finder over the lid of the trunk.DOCTOR (O.S.)... both women... subjected to the 
                         most violent shock...INSPECTOR (O.S.)What sort of shock?DOCTOR...still cannot determine - but 
                         look!

               He points to something in the trunk - out of the camera's 
               eye-line.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.

               He balances carefully - then raises the camera above his 
               head. As he leans forward, the pencils fall. WE SEE them 
               shooting like small torpedoes into the darkness below. 
               They make three separate landings.

               CLOSE SHOT of the Inspector. Looking up.

               From his POV WE SEE tiers of scaffolding deep in shadow...INSPECTORQuiet, everyone.  Please...

               The Detectives make as much noise to become quiet as the 
               normal occupants of the studio - and then there is complete 
               silence.

               Complete, except for the Doctor's asthmatic breathing... 
               And then - so gently that it might almost be in our own 
               minds - WE HEAR a purring sound from the shadows above. 
               The Inspector listens intently.DETECTIVEI thought I heard a putty cat!

               There is a burst of laughter - the Inspector frowns.INSPECTORI don't want to spoil anyone's 
                         fun, but we do have a maniac on 
                         our hands, and if we don't get him 
                         quickly there'll be a third unsolved 
                         murder to report to the 
                         Commissioner. So let's hurry things 
                         up, shall we?DETECTIVESorry, Chief!

               The 'putty cat' Detective raises his flashlamp towards the 
               trunk counter. In the brilliant flash of light that ensues, 
               we glimpse a shadowy figure moving towards a ladder high 
               in the scaffolding... But then we are looking for it - no 
               one else is. The flashlight dies away.  

               The scene fades with it.

               He looks slowly round the room, stares for a moment at the 
               bed in the comer, but he won't cross the threshold. He

               Suddenly Mark stands motionless. He is staring at something 
               off camera.

               Especially when -

               Her voice trails away... she is staring at Mark staring at

               In the shadows, at the mouth of an alley, a young couple 
               are kissing.

               Mark stands motionless, staring at them. Automatically his 
               hand reaches for his camera. Helen starts to speak - then 
               looks at him in silence. The man glances round. Mark hurries 
               away and Helen stares after him.

               He turns back - waiting for Helen.

               From his POV WE SEE Helen come slowly towards him. She 
               looks at him searchingly for a long moment.

               Mark glances at the blind - then looks away quickly.

               He stares ahead of him... and continues to stare ahead of 
               him.

               Suddenly Helen tucks her arm through his, and smiles up at 
               him... they walk on in silence.DISSOLVE TO:INT. HALL OF MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHTHelen and Mark come in quietly, and close the door.

               He stands motionless as she goes into her room... 

               From his POV WE SEE the half-opened door - and the bed in 
               the comer.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark forcing himself to look away.

               Helen reappears on the threshold - the camera in her hand. 
               He looks down at it - then slowly stretches out his hand.HELENwonder how this sees grown-ups?
                              (she turns the camera

               The door at the end of the passage opens and Tony emerges 
               in his dressing-gown, carrying a towel. He avoids looking 
               at them - goes into the bathroom opposite, and slams the 
               door.HELENHe'll wake Mother!

               There is the sound of running water.HELEN... thank you, again, for my

               He looks down at the face which he has found for himself. 
               She raises her head slowly.MARK...faces which - are faces which...

               She kisses him very gently on the mouth. The bathroom begins 
               to sound like a small waterfall.HELENGood night, Mark...

               He watches her as she goes into the room, and doses the 
               door. A light goes on beneath the door.

               He stands very still for a moment... then turns the camera 
               round and points the lens towards his lips.

               Then he turns abruptly, and hurries up the stairs.

               The waterfall cascades on.  The screen grows dark - and 
               the dark-room grows out of it.INT. DARK-ROOM - NIGHTThe big drying drum is turning, feeding the dry print into 
               a box. A small motor drives it.  CLOSE SHOT of the box. 
               Mark is spooling up the film as it comes off the drier. 
               Once or twice he can't help glancing at an image.

               CLOSE UP of Vivian's face, in the image.

               Mark stops the motor and the drum, loosens the end of the 
               film, spools up with a snap, slides the spool off and 
               hurries out with it.

               Mark hurries to his projector, threads the film and starts 
               the projector. He flicks it on, as if it were a gramophone, 
               then looks eagerly at the 16mm screen.  

               Behind him something moves in the shadows 

               REVERSE SHOT of Mark.  

               Over the shoulder of someone who is standing deep in the 
               shadows WE SEE Mark. His head obscures what he is watching 
               on the screen.HE TURNS ROUND SUDDENLY -From Mark's POV WE SEE the processing sinks deep in shadow. 
               He starts to move towards them, then suddenly stares at

               Silence - except for the whirring of the 16mm projector.

               turns round... he is as astonished at what he sees as he 
               can be.

               CAMERA PANS in its own good time to the back of the room.  

               Mrs. Stephens is standing in the shadows... a heavy hand 
               rests on a heavy stick... the sightless eyes stare

               He stands motionless, staring at her standing motionless. 
               Above her head an ancient, half-blind camera also stares 
               at her. The only movement in the room is her smile.MRS. STEPHENSThis is one room I expected to

               CLOSE SHOT of the stick. It is a shooting stick - with a 
               sharp spike on the end of it, similar to the tripod on 
               Mark's camera.

               Mark stares at the stick, fascinated.

               In Mrs. Stephens' own dark-room we hear the hum of Mark's

               faintly, the sounds of Tony bathing himself.MRS. STEPHENSEvery night you switch on that

               He takes her arm gently and guides her towards us.

               Both of them stare at the 16mm screen... She leans forward - 
               her face only inches from the screen - the light from the 
               projector flickering on to her.

               out her hands and touches the screen.MRS. STEPHENSWhat am I seeing, Mark?

               He looks at her thoughtfully, then presses a light switch. 
               A spotlight falls blindingly on to her eyes. He presses 
               another switch, and then another, until the whole of her 
               face is shining with light.MRS. STEPHENSWhy are you putting those lights

               He walks towards her. She starts to back away.

               The shadow of Mark's head appears on the 16mm screen. WE 
               SEE him raise his camera - then pull down the tripod.  

               Black out into the grey darkness of Mrs. Stephens' world.  

               WE HEAR the purring of Mark's camera - more clearly than 
               we have yet heard it. (There is the faint rasp of a cog 
               which needs oiling.) The sound of footsteps approaching...

               The purring is on top of her. There is a sudden thud.FADE IN:Mrs. Stephens is leaning against the wall... she has dropped 
               her heavy stick. It lies on the floor a few feet away from 
               her. Mark is kneeling in front of her - the tripod firmly 
               on the floor. The cine-camera is pointing upwards into her 
               face. He peers excitedly into the viewfinder.MARKPlease let me finish! It's for 
                         Helen!

               She edges towards her stick. He hurries forward and picks 
               it up. He looks at the spike on the end of it - then 
               carefully gives it to her by the handle. She grasps it 
               tightly.MRS. STEPHENSWhat do you mean? It's for Helen?MARKShe wants to see something I've

               On Mark's focusing screen WE SEE the fear on her face. Her 
               hand trembles as she wipes away the perspiration.MARK (O.S.)Please... don't be frightened.MRS. STEPHENSNot frightened! Hot!

               But it is fear that we are looking at.MRS. STEPHENSSo put that camera away...

               On the focusing screen we see her moisten her lips 
               nervously.MARKYes!

               He switches off the camera abruptly, and folds up the 
               tripod. He turns away without looking at her - and hurries 
               to the door.

               Inspector.

               From his POV WE SEE Mark and the Doctor talking. The Doctor 
               is fidgeting with his watch chain. Mark fidgets with his 
               jacket button. The Inspector then glances towards the Hat

               From the Sergeant's POV WE SEE the Doctor hand Mark a card, 
               and pat him jovially on the shoulder. The Sergeant edges

               curiously at the projector.  

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen - hesitating. Like a small girl in 
               front of her mother's make-up box, she touches the projector 
               tentatively, hesitates again, then presses a switch. A 
               beam of light shoots out. We watch Helen's face as she 
               looks at the screen. Nothing seems wrong for a few seconds - 
               then something starts to happen to the comers of her 
               mouth... and then her eyes become locked... and cannot 
               stop watching. Some kind of sound comes from the back of 
               her throat. Her hands dig into the table and she tries to 
               stand up. She cannot manage it the first time - and keeps 
               on watching, then, like a child waking from a nightmare, 
               she jerks herself away from the table, and stumbles towards 
               the door.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen staring at him... again we hear that

               From her POV WE SEE him standing in front of the door,

               The room is suddenly filled with the terrified screaming 
               of a small boy. Helen wheels round. The screaming seems to 
               be coming from the walls. Mark's hand is on a switch - one 
               of a number on a panel.MARK... aged five...

               He presses another switch. There is a click, and the 
               screaming stops, to be replaced by a low sobbing.MARK... aged seven... 

               He presses another switch. There is a moment's silence.MARKAll the rooms were wired for

               from her.HELENLook at me, Mark!MARKNot if you're frightened...HELENLook at me!

               Slowly he faces her.HELENWhat did you do... to those girls?MARKNo.HELENWhat did you do, Mark...?

               He tries to turn away - but she follows him.HELENIf you want to torment me... for

               He turns to his cine-camera, and picks it up. He releases 
               the tripod.

               CAMERA HOLDS on Helen. She stands very still against the 
               wall. Mark's voice is overlaid.MARK (O.S.)Do you know... what the most 
                         frightening thing in the world 
                         is?...

               She is looking at something, puzzled.MARKIt's fear.

               The sound of his footsteps approaching...MARKSo I did something... very simple...

               WE SEE a look of fear spring into her eyes.MARKVery simple.

               WE SEE the spike approaching her throat... but she is 
               looking at something else.MARKWhen they felt the spike... touching 
                         their throats... and knew I was

               The spike is touching her throat.MARK... I made them - watch their own 
                         deaths!

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen's face several times its natural size. 
               She is looking at herself in a large circular magnifying 
               mirror which has been fitted over the camera's face. The 
               mirror entirely obscures both Mark and the camera. There 
               is a small hole in the mirror through which the lens of 
               the camera winks. As Helen looks at her terrified distorted 
               face this small hole gives her an extra eye in the middle 
               of her forehead.MARKMade them see their own terror as 
                         the spike went in... and if death 
                         has a face, they saw that too!

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark - crouching behind the mirror, sweat 
               pouring down his forehead... his finger on the trigger of 
               the camera.MARKNot you! Not you! I'll never 
                         photograph you! I promised - I 
                         promised - Not you!  

               Helen's eyes are closed. The spike is still touching her 
               throat.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark ï¿½ his face turned away from the 
               viewfinder.HELEN... frightened ... for you...

               There's the sound of a car pulling up. He hurries to the 
               other room.EXT. HOUSE - NIGHTThe Police arrive: three cars.  Mark appears at an upstairs 
               window with his camera.SERGEANTLook out!

               He thinks Mark has a gun. They all duck. Mark raises his 
               camera and photographs them. The Police recover and charge 
               for the house. Mark disappears.INT. DARK-ROOM - NIGHTMark hurries back into the room carrying his camera. He 
               knows exactly what he has to do.HELENMark! Mark! Give yourself up!MARKI've been ready for this... for 
                         such a long time...

               Rapidly he fixes his camera on to a hook on the wall. Then 
               he adjusts the tripod so that the spikes protrude towards 
               him...HELENWhat are you...MARKIt'll be all right.

               He makes chalk marks on the floor in front of the camera, 
               then switches on all the floodlights. WE CAN HEAR the 
               Policemen pounding on the door.MARKI can beat that!

               He crosses to a switch - presses it.  The room is filled 
               with a small boy's screaming.HELENGive yourself up... Mark!

               He stands next to her, and looks at his long array of 
               cameras. WE SEE that each one of them has been fitted with 
               a small metal disc (a delayed release), and that some of 
               the older cameras have flashlights attached.MARKWatch them, Helen... Watch them 
                         say goodbye - one by one -
                              (he presses a master 
                              switch on the wait)
                         I've timed this... so often...

               Slowly he walks past his cameras. As he does, the metallic 
               disc on each one explodes with a little plop - and the eye 
               of each camera winks once as if in salute. Some go off 
               with flashlights on either side of the room. The sound of 
               footsteps hurrying up the stairs.

               Ahead of Mark - coming steadily closer ï¿½ are the spikes of 
               the tripod. The mirror on the cine-camera reflects the 
               approach - and Helen's terrified face.HELENNo - No!

               The child's screaming reaches its peak as Mark approaches 
               the spikes... Ahead of him, on the small table where his 
               projector stands, is Helen's book The Magic Camera.MARKI wish... I could have found your 
                         faces for you... 

               The Policemen are now rattling on the dark-room door.MARKHelen - I'm afraid!

               We see his face, terrified, in the magnifying mirror. The 
               spikes are against his throat. The eye of the camera is 
               winking rapidly.MARKI'm glad I'm afraid!

               Heavy shoulders are pressing against the dark-room door... 
               as it breaks in, Mark lunges forward against the spikes. 
               The cine-camera is wrenched away from the wall as he falls 
               back. He crashes against the small table, which falls over. 
               He is not parted from his camera - it is fixed to him by 
               the tripod, and falls back with him, covering his face 
               like a canopy. WE SEE his face in the lens of the cine-
               camera. and WE SEE his hand - lying limp on the cover of 
               The Magic Camera.

               The Policemen hurry into the room. They stare motionless 
               at what they see.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen - her face buried in her hands.

               The child's screaming stops suddenly... and in the absolute 
               silence which follows WE HEAR the voice of Mark's father:FATHER'S VOICE (O.S.)Don't be a silly boy... there's 
                         nothing to be afraid of...

               And a small voice answers.CHILD'S VOICE (O.S.)Good night, Daddy...

               The spotlights begin to dim... The dazzling white of the 
               16mm screen fades slowly into greyness...

               The room is filled with the gentle breathing of a small 
               child.FADE OUT:THE END
