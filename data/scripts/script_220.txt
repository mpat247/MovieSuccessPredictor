grass staring up at the clouds. In the distance, the school
door opens and Mason's MOM, Olivia, walks toward him.MOMHey, love bug. You ready?

He is quickly on his feet and they are walking toward the
car.MASONYeah.     Hey, guess what, Mom?MOMWhat?MASONI figured out where wasps come from.MOMOh, yeah?    Where?MASONWell, I think it must be if you flick
             a rock into the air just right, it'll
             turn into a wasp.MOMDang...MASONYep.MOMThat's cool.INT. CAR - DAYDriving...MOMSo how was your day at school?MASONFine.MOMHey, I had a good meeting with Miss

          turning in your homework assignments.
          And I told her, "I know he does them,
          'cause I check them every night."
          She said she found a big chunk of
          them crumpled up at the bottom of
          your backpack.MASONShe didn't ask for 'em.MOMWell, baby, she doesn't have to.
          You're supposed to turn them in.
          And she said you're still staring
          out the window all day.MASONNot all day.MOMAnd she said that you destroyed her
          pencil sharpener.MASONNot on purpose.MOMWait, she said that you crammed a
          bunch of rocks in it.MASONI thought if it could sharpen pencils,
          maybe we could sharpen rocks.MOM(stifling laugh)
          Well, what were you gonna do with a
          bunch of sharpened rocks?MASONI was trying to make arrowheads for
          my rock collection.MOMHm.

          don't know what that's like.INT. KID'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNINGMason is comfortably asleep. Samantha slowly pulls the pillow
out from underneath his head and smacks him with it.SAMANTHA(singing)
          "Oops, I did it again... I played
          with your heart. Got lost in the
          game. Oh baby, baby..."

Mason throws a stuffed animal at her that she deflects.SAMANTHA (CONT'D)"Oops, you think I'm in love. I'm
          sent from above. I'm not that
          innocent."

Another stuffed animal.    She continues to sing.MASON (O.S.)Stop! Quit it!SAMANTHA"You see my problem is this. I'm
          dreaming away. Wishing that heroes

          ways..."MASONQuit!   Mom!SAMANTHA"But to lose all my senses-- that
          is..."

He tries to drown out this last bit with a sustained scream.
Soon the door flies open and Mom enters, angry.MOMWhat the hell is going on in here?!

Samantha has instantaneously shifted from singing to crying.MOM (O.S.) (CONT'D)Do you guys know what time it is?8.SAMANTHA(through tears/sobs)

           to stay together.MASONWhat if after we move he's trying to
           find us and he can't?MOMOh, that won't be a problem. He can

During the last bit of this conversation, Mason slowly paints
over the "growth chart" lines on the bedroom door jamb.12.EXT. OUTSIDE FRONT DOOR - DAYCarrying their final belongings from inside the house, they
slowly exit the front door and head over to the car.MOMOkay, let's go, 'cause I wanna get

Just before he gets in the car, Mason is looking out at the
neighborhood.MASONGoodbye old lady who listens to rock
          music and rides a motorcycle.

Soon the car is pulling away. As they drive off, Mason
notices out his side of the car, Tommy approaching on a bike
in the distance, gesturing toward the car. Mason watches
him out the window, but says nothing as Tommy recedes into
the distance.INT. CAR - DAYMason and Samantha are restless     and energetic, letting their
childish energy get the best of     them as they wrestle, hit,
and squeal at each other in the     back seat of the car. It is
all well-intentioned though, as     the two share a laugh after
Mom tells them to quiet down.SAMANTHAEeeee!   Don't!MOMHey! Hey, what's happening back
          there? Stop, put the barrier up.SAMANTHAAhh!   Stop!    No!13.Mason punches the pillow barrier between himself and Samantha,

          up, but we've kinda grown apart.
          She sorta got all emo. She thinks
          I'm a prep. But, I still consider
          her a friend! Anyway, she cut one
          of her wrists. I don't know how
          bad, but I think I should go visit.

Jill glances down at the book in Mason's hand.JILL (CONT'D)So what are you reading?MASONOh, it's uh, "Breakfast of Champions".
          Kurt Vonnegut.JILLI think my older brother likes him.
          I'm reading "To Kill a Mockingbird"
          for the third time. My friends make
          fun of me. I think I'm the only

          like the "Twilight" books. Have you

tell Chase to make sure you're there.MASONOkay.JILLBut don't tell LeeAnn I told you

observe from the back, while she lectures.MOM (O.S.)His cognitive series, his interviews
          with orphans, Ethology theorists'
          work... And then he in turn was
          supported strongly by Harry Harlow's
          rhesus monkey study. Now you guys,
          you gotta think, this is the 1950's,
          this was radical! This flew in the
          face of traditional learning theory,
          of B.F. Skinner's classical and
          instrumental conditioning. Now,
          Bowlby is going to argue that human
          survival depends on us falling in
          love. It depends on me falling in
          love with my mother, and my mother
          falling in love with me. And if
          that doesn't happen, we're pretty
          much doomed. Now think about it. A
          tiger chases our tribe out of a cave.
          Now an ideal mother goes, "Huh! My
          baby! I love you! I'll protect
          you!" Or... "Well you, why am I
          going to pick you up? You're going
          to slow me down. You... are... tiger
          kibble!"

          to rig up our iPods to the external
          speakers on the ASV. So every time
          we come rolling into town, you knew
          the 456 was there, 'cause we were
          bumping House of Pain. It was like,
          "Jump around, Jump around." And the
          whole family's coming outside, and
          you got the kids and the mom and the
          dad, and they're all bouncing up and
          down. We're throwing out candies
          for the kids, and soccer balls, and
          Beanie Babies, and Frisbees... Um,
          like, smokes for the adults. And
          they loved, they absolutely loved,
          Gatorade. But for some reason, you
          know, they hated the lemon-lime
          flavor. I don't know what it was.
          Yeah. Couldn't give it away.102.The group laughs.MOMHow long were you over there?JIMUhh... I did two tours in Iraq and
          one in Bosnia.MOMWow.MASONDid you enlist?JIMMm-hmm. Yeah. I was, um, Army
          National Guard. And, uh, you know
          coming straight out of high school.
          Needed money for college. Seemed
          like a decent paying job. And, uh,
          did my tour. And whenever I got
          done, I told them if there's, you
          know, a world-changing event, I'll
          come back. And, uh, 3 months later
          9/11 happened. And I was back 9/12.

          whole time we were there, we never
          lost a guy. Not one casualty.MOMBut is that odd?    Is that unusual?JIMYeah. Almost impossible. Like the
          guys that came along after us and
          replaced us, they didn't listen to
          any of our advice. They, you know,
          did basically the polar opposite of
          what we did, and they lost seven
          guys in the first month.MOMWow. What did you guys do
          differently?JIMWell, I'd like to think it's just a
          matter of mutual respect, you know.
          I mean, all the time we spent over
          there building trust, I mean these

           Yeah. Right?

Mason walks outside, carrying a duffel bag.DAD (CONT'D)Hey bud!     Hey, Happy Birthday!

The mini-van catches Mason's attention.109.MASONWhat's that?DADWhat's that?     That's our new car!
          Get in it.

Dad gives Mason a hug.    Jim shakes Mason's hand.JIMAlright, have a good weekend.

Mom arrives at the front yard and greets Dad with a hug.MOMHi.DADHey, how you doing?      Good to see

           night.MOMBye, honey.     I'm so glad you were

Dad, Annie, and the kids drive off for Houston. Mom and Jim
are left standing in the front yard, as they watch the van
drive away.INT.   MINI-VAN - DAYMASONSo, this is like Annie's car and...
           and you drive the GTO? I guess you
           can't really put a baby seat in that
           thing.DADYeah, no...     But I had to sell that
           anyway.MASONYou what?DADYeah, I had to sell that.MASONSo... so it's gone?DADYeah, some sucker collector from
           California paid twenty-two grand for
           it, which is great 'cause I basically
           got to pay for this in cash. I only
           paid eighty-five hundred for that
           thing way back when. I mean, you
           know, cars are generally a terrible
           investment. You know? Soon as you
           drive them off the lot you got a used
           car on your hands, and the value's
           only dropping from there.(MORE)111.DAD (CONT'D)But... if you take care of it, you
          know, and you get lucky and it's a
          classic, you know, the value starts
          going up again. I mean shit, you got
          guys paying hundreds of thousands of
          dollars for some Shelby Cobra.

After a long silence, Dad notices Mason is unusually quiet.DAD (CONT'D)What?MASONYou don't remember?DADRemember what?MASONReally? You said that was going to
          be my car when I turned sixteen.DAD(laughs)
          What? No, I didn't.       I never said
          that.MASONI remember. I was in third grade
          and you were taking me over to Anthony
          Nagar's house for his birthday...
          and we were there early, so we gave
          him a ride around the block. And he
          was talking about how much he loved
          your car and so you were all like
          "Oh. This is going to be Mason's
          when he turns 16."DADWhat are you..? Alright, first off,
          I have no memory of that, alright?
          Second of all, I would never say
          that. Never.MASONYeah.   You did though.DADWhat? Mason. Come on, what about
          your sister? I'm just gonna forget
          about her? Come on, how's that fair?
          Huh? Anthony Nagar, what the?(MORE)112.DAD (CONT'D)(laughs)
          Are you...? Oh, come on! I mean,
          you're not... Ughh.
          Look, you can sit there like there's
          a death in the family, alright, but
          bottom line is that was my car.
          Alright? I paid for it, I took care
          of it, and I can do whatever I want
          with it. Alright? I'm sorry if you
          had other ideas about it but when
          you get older you can save up and
          buy a car of your own. And be cool
          like I used to be. Or... you can
          get a mini-van.

Annie and Samantha watch a Lady Gaga music video on Samantha's
cell phone in the back seat.ANNIEDoes your mom actually let you watch
          this?SAMANTHAYeah.     She likes it too.ANNIE(laughing)
          Oh, my god... Okay, well.SAMANTHAYeah.ANNIEHave you ever seen her in concert?SAMANTHANo. But she's coming to Houston in
          April.ANNIEShe's coming to Houston?SAMANTHAMm-hmm.ANNIEOh you know, your dad and I could
          get you tickets, and you could stay
          with us.SAMANTHAThat'd be great.113.ANNIEYeah.DADHey, hey, Annie? Will you get me
          the, the little birthday present for
          Mason?ANNIEYeah, babe.

Annie hands a small wrapped present to Dad.   Mason unwraps
the gift to reveal a CD set.DADAlright. This one, this one needs a
          little explanation, okay? Open it
          up. I call that "The Beatles' Black
          Album". Alright, what it is, is the
          best of John, Paul, George, and Ringo
          solo, post-break up.MASONThanks.DADYeah, basically, I put the band back
          together for you.

Annie Laughs.DAD (CONT'D)You know, whenever you listen to too
          much of the solo stuff, it kind of
          becomes a drag, you know? But you
          put 'em next to each other, alright,
          and they start to elevate each
          other... and then you can hear it.
          Huh! It's The Beatles. You know?MASONI don't know. I think I always just
          liked Paul the best.DADIt doesn't matter, you know, you're
          missing the point. There is no
          favorite Beatle! That's what I'm
          saying. It's in the balance. That's
          what made them the greatest fucking
          rock band in the world. Okay? You
          know, and there's this decade of
          music out there that's been scattered.
          Alright?(MORE)114.DAD (CONT'D)And now it has been carefully found,
          arranged, and ordered for you, by
          your loving father.ANNIEVery arranged and very organized,
          over and over again by your loving
          father.DADYes, yes, yes. So, I mean, look at
          that-- look at that, uh, top of Volume
          II, first four tracks... You've got
          "Band on the Run" into "My Sweet
          Lord", into "Jealous Guy", into
          "Photograph". I mean, come on.
          It's like the perfect segue. You
          got Paul, who takes you to the party,
          George who talks to you about God,
          John who says no, it's about love
          and pain, and then Ringo who just
          says hey, can't we enjoy what we
          have while we have it? It's a good
          record. I shit you not.MASONCool.EXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAYThe mini-van drives along a dirt road lined with trees and

          was a little younger than you, and

          If you go home, you're rolling the

          Poof! About that time, here comes
          Jesus, standing right next to him.
          Okay? And he turns to Thomas. Don't
          you know Thomas felt some shame?
          And he turns to Thomas and says,
          "Thomas, here, stick your finger in

          the flesh. We haven't felt him in

          technically, you don't ever have to
          be in here these days, and certainly
          not until you've completed your
          assignments. That's the deal.125.MASONSorry.TURLINGTONI'm worried about you, Mason.MASONWhy is that?TURLINGTONI'll tell you why. The images you're
          turning in, they're cool. You're
          looking at things in a really unique
          way. Got a lot of natural talent.MASONThanks.TURLINGTONYeah, but, that and fifty cents will
          just get you a cup of coffee in this
          old world. I've met a lot of talented
          people over the years. How many of
          them made it professionally without
          discipline, commitment, and a really
          good work ethic?

Mason shrugs and shakes his head, unsure.TURLINGTON (CONT'D)I can tell you. I can count it on

          actually build cyborgs and robots...
          I mean, the costs of that were

          pathetically desperate for attention.
          Or to be different, or something.MASONThat's just 'cause they did that
          lame story about it in the school
          paper.SHEENAAnd then he had to make a big
          announcement about it when he came
          back a month later.MASONThat's the thing though, I'm not
          doing it for attention. I just want
          to try and not live my life through
          a screen. I want, like, some kind
          of actual interaction. A real person,

          are you really doing? You don't
          care what your friends are up to on

          Am I, uh, am I your only ex at this
          party?MOMYes, but I'm not your only wife here,
          though.DADYeah.MOMCan you believe they're both out of
          high school?DADNo.  No, I can't.
              (a beat)
          You did a great job with both of
          them, by the way.MOMThanks for saying that. I never
          thought I'd hear you say that.DADWell, it's true.    Thank you.MOMAnd you're doing it all over again,
          huh?DADI know, I know, right? It's gonna be
          uh, fifteen years till I have an
          empty nest. But hey, I'd love to
          pitch in, help with this, if I could.(MORE)165.DAD (CONT'D)I mean, it's so great that you did
          this. I was just going to give you
          a little. I'd appreciate it if I
          could.

He pulls out his wallet.MOMSure.   Yeah.DADYeah. But I don't have any cash.
          It's in Annie's purse. I'll be right
          back.INT. ANTONE'S - EVENINGMason and Dad are wandering through the green room area while
the band is doing a sound check.DAD...So it sucks. I mean, the guy's a
          college lacrosse player. I mean,
          what are you gonna do?MASONShe didn't even like sports.

An iced-down bucket of drinks beckons.DADYou want a beer?MASONNo, that's alright.DADYou can have one.MASONIt's okay.

They continue their conversation out of the green room to a
little area overlooking the stage.DADYeah, well, for what it's worth,
          we've all been through the exact
          same thing, at one point or another.MASONIt's not the same, though.     I mean,
          you never got to know her.166.DADNo, I know, I know.    It's not the
          same.MASONI just don't know what I did wrong.

At this point Dad yells down to Jimmy, his roommate from
years before, briefly interrupting the sound check.DADHey, Jimmy.    Hey, man.   Hey --JIMMYHey, Mason.DADWe're up here raiding the green room.
          Hope that's okay.JIMMYThat's totally cool.DADAlright.JIMMYWow!   Is that M.J.?DADUh-huh.    Right?JIMMYUnbelievable.DADWell, we just decided to come a little
          early, check you out.JIMMYThat's cool man, let me finish up,
          I'll be up in a minute.DADAlright, alright.

He and Mason slowly start to drift around the venue.DAD (CONT'D)(back to Mason)
          I guarantee you, you didn't do
          anything wrong. These high school
          love things, they never work out.
          Here, come here.(MORE)167.DAD (CONT'D)I mean, everyone's just changing so
much. The odds of two young people
staying on the same wavelength are...MASONYeah, but still --DADLook, and I also guarantee you that
every day of your life that you spend
crying over some silly girl is a
complete waste of time.MASONShe wasn't a silly girl, though.   I
mean, she's a serious person. I
really thought we were --DADWhat?MASONI don't know.DADHere's the truth. Women are never
satisfied. Ok? They're always
looking to potentially trade up and
that's, I'm sorry to say, what I
think has happened to you my fine
feathered friend.MASONWhat does that even mean?DADIt means don't hand over the controls
to your self-esteem to Sheila.MASONSheena.DADAlright. It means you are responsible
for you, not your girlfriend, not
your mom, not me. You. And if you
truly take care of you, you will be
amazed at how much girls like Sheena
start lining up at your front door.MASONGreat.168.DADYeah, you know, you just gotta
separate yourself from the pack in
some way. Excel at something, you
know, and then you have your pick of
the litter when them front-running
hussies start sniffing around.MASONSo what you're saying is, I should
take up lacrosse.DADExactly. Or you could, you know,
start a band. Worked for me a long
time ago. I think it's still working
for Jimmy. Or you just keep taking
pictures.MASONShe hated the pictures I took of
her.DADAlright. I'm sick to death of her,
okay? I only met her a few times
and yes she was cute, alright. But,
truth be told I always thought she
was a little bit, you know, a little
bit too square for you. Y'know, not
quite the same vibe.MASONYou really thought that?DADOn some subtle, lower level. I mean,
uh, I wasn't surprised when it turned
out she was interested in some
knucklehead lacrosse player, okay?
I mean, bottom line is, it's all
timing with these things. Y'know.
I mean, uh, take your mom and me.
Y'know I think I probably turned
into the boring castrated guy she
wanted me to be fifteen or twenty
years ago, y'know? And man I'm not
saying she was wrong to be pissed.
I'm not, I'm just saying that, y'know,
she could have been a little more
patient... a little more forgiving.MASONWould've saved me that parade of
drunken assholes.169.Dad gestures zipping his lip, saying nothing.MASON (CONT'D)So what's the point?DADOf what?MASONI don't know, any of this.
          Everything.DADEverything? What's the point? I
          mean I sure as shit don't know. I
          mean, but, neither does anybody else.
          Okay, we're all just winging it, you
          know? I mean the good news is you're
          feeling stuff. You know? And you
          got to hold onto that. You do. I
          mean you get older and you don't
          feel as much. You're skin gets
          tougher. The point is those pictures
          you took. Thousands of submissions
          from all over the state and you won.MASONWell, I got silver.   And nine other
          people did, too.DADI'm gonna kill you. I'm tryin' to
          tell you that I believe in you,
          Mason. I think you're really special,
          and if some girl doesn't see that,
          then fuck her, y'know?

Jimmy's at the mic.JIMMY (O.S.)Hey, this next one goes out to a

          boy, now he's all graduated from
          high school, making me feel old.

great.170.INT. CAFE - DAYMom, Mason and Samantha sit down at a table.     A waitress
places menus.MOMThank you. Okay guys, let's be clear.
          I'm going to break this into four
          categories. One. Anything you wanna
          keep from your childhood and your
          taking with you. Two. Throwing
          away. Three. Donating. Four.
          Whatever you wanna try to sell at
          the garage sell next weekend, whatever
          we don't sell, we're donating.MASONDoesn't the apartment have like an
          attic, or storage or something?MOMNo. You're missing the point. We're
          not going to drag a bunch of crap to
          mom's tiny apartment.SAMANTHACan't believe we're moving again.MOMNo, I'm moving! You moved two years
          ago. You have an apartment in Austin.
          Mason is moving the fall. I'm done.
          This will be great for me. I'll
          have all these options. I could
          take a sabbatical. I could get some
          writing done and try to get published.MASONWhat about Christmas, though?   What
          are we gonna do?SAMANTHAI'm not sharing a room with him.MOMOne of you will sleep on the couch,
          and we'll use that blow-up mattress.SAMANTHAHow am I supposed to do my laundry?MOMSam, I'm gently pushing you out of
          the nest.(MORE)171.MOM (CONT'D)And on your way down you may magically

          need to take some responsibility!

Mom puts her glasses on.MASONI'm gonna get the veggie burger.SAMANTHAI'm not having anything, not hungry.

Mom takes her glasses off.MOMWhat's wrong with you?SAMANTHAI'm sick.MOMWhat is it, your head?   Do you have
          a fever?MASONShe's pregnant.SAMANTHA(weak laugh)
          No. To be honest, I drank way too
          much last night.MOMYou weren't driving, were you?SAMANTHANo. No. Carrie's back home, too,

          so easy.MOMNo, no. Hey - that's not an excuse.

          people want to move in as soon as
          possible.

The assistant restaurant manager, who'll we'll come to know
as ERNESTO, approaches the table.172.ERNESTOHi guys. I'm Ernesto, how are you?
              (to Mom)
          Uh, you probably don't remember me,
          but I worked on your septic line
          years ago.MOMOh, yeah.ERNESTOBelieve it or not, you changed my
          life. Yeah, you told me that day
          that I was smart and that I should
          go to school. I took your advice!
          I signed up for English classes and
          then a year later I went to community
          college and I got my associates
          degree. And I'm working on my
          bachelors now at Texas State. And
          I'm also one of the managers here.MOMThat's great.ERNESTOUh, it's good to see you. Because I
          really wanted a chance to thank you
          for that. Gracias. It really meant
          a lot to me. Don't worry about lunch.
          It's on me. It's the least I can
          do.MOMThanks.ERNESTOYou guys should listen to her.   She's
          a smart lady.MOMThank you.

Ernesto walks back toward the kitchen, leaving the three
seated at the table.EXT. APARTMENT - MORNINGMason, now with a scruffy beard, is wedging a duffel bag and
bin into the bed of his truck. He walks back toward Mom's
new apartment.173.INT. APARTMENT - MORNINGMason is packing a box, in mid-conversation with Mom, who is
seated in another room.MASON...Isn't that kind of crazy though,
          that a computer knows who you are
          from just twenty questions off a
          form? I guess there are really only
          like eight types of people in the
          world.

Mom goes to the kitchen and pours coffee into a mug.MASON (CONT'D)I mean there are subsets, like male
          and female, but apparently we're not
          as unique as we want to think we
          are.MOMHave you even talked to this guy
          yet?MASONNo, but we've been trading emails.
          He seems pretty cool. He's studying
          literature, and uh, anthropology,
          and he's way into Bright Eyes... so
          that's not so bad. But anyways, he
          was telling me about how the system
          they use for assigning roommates is
          kind of spooky. Like, the Freshmen
          satisfaction rate for new roommates
          used to be like 60%, and now it's
          100%. Just cause of the computer.MOMWell. Sounds like he'll be a good
          roommate, then.MASONYeah. But we've pretty much decided
          that soon they won't even need a
          questionnaire. Because they'll just
          let the NSA scan your digital ghost,
          and they'll tell you who your roommate
          is, based on everything you've ever
          said, written, or clicked.

Mason walks back into the living room, carrying a box.   He
holds up a framed picture.174.MASON (CONT'D)Did you -- Did you put this in here
          again?

Mom laughs.MASON (CONT'D)I don't want it.MOMCome on, it's the first picture you
          ever took.MASONWell, I mean, all the more reason to
          leave it behind, right?

Mason goes to put the picture back in his room, while Mom
suddenly breaks into quiet sobs.

He comes back out, wearing a backpack, and notices Mom crying.MASON (CONT'D)What?MOM(crying)
          Nothing.MASONNo, what is it?MOMNothing!MASONMom...MOMThis is the worst day of my life.MASONWhat are you talking about?MOMI knew this day was coming. I just --
          I didn't know you were gonna be so
          fuckin' happy to be leaving.MASONI mean, it's not that I'm that happy.
          What do you, what do you expect?175.MOMYou know what I'm realizing? My
          life is just gonna go, like that!
          This series of milestones. Getting
          married, having kids, getting
          divorced, the time that we thought
          you were dyslexic, when I taught you
          how to ride a bike, getting divorced
