          but powerful looking black man, bald with a gray fringe.
          His baldness makes his head look muscular; he is a tough
          man whose life has been shaped by the violence of the docks.
          His name is EDDIE BLACK.
          In the distance a foghorn moans.
          We are pulling back.BLACKYeah. .'Cause he's an asshole. Tell
          him no... Tell him no too... Him, tell
          fuck you... Yeah... Uh huh...
          The continuing pull back shows that we are inside a huge
          empty pier building. Black is leaning against the roof of
          his car, which is parked in the middle of the vast empty
          space.
          The room is lit by bare bulbs, its farthest reaches
          falling into darkness.BLACKNo, I'll be a few minutes here. Guy
          comin' up, thinks he's gonna muscle me
          outs my property... Does it matter?
          Just another tough guy...Yeah, okay...
          Another hard-looking man is approaching.CONTINUED2.1 CONTINUEDMANThey're drivin' up.

          for those fuckers.22 EXT WHARF - DAYWe are tracking towards a chain link fence which is
          swinging open to admit two midnight blue Lincoln
          Continentals.
          The cars stop in the foreground and eight men get out,
          eerily backlit in the mist of the riverfront.33 SLOW TRACKING - ROBERT G. DURANTis a well-dressed and immaculately groomed man of forty.44 SLOW TRACKING - RUDY GUZMANwears a powder blue, polyester leisure suit. His nose has
          been broken several times from his years in the Mexican
          boxing league. He was almost a contender.55 SLOW TRACKING - SKIP NATICKwalks with a pronounced limp.66 SLOW TRACKING - TRUMAYNE JOHNSON MC SAMis a large black man with a quiet, studied cool.77 SLOW TRACKING - RICKis a wiry twenty-year old who looks about in short, jerky
          motions. He huddles in behind the others. He is
          stylishly dressed, with slicked back, black hair. His
          protruding Adams apple bobs as he swallows.3.B SLOW TRACKING - SMILEY 8wears a permanent psychotic smile.9 SLOW TRACKING - PAULY 9is middle-aged and balding. His spare tire hangs over the
          edge of his suit pants. He subdues a belch. He raises a
          bottle of Maalox and slugs down fifty cents worth. A ring
          of white chalky fluid coats his lips.10 SLOW TRACKING - CORKY CORCORAN 10has a thatch of blond hair, he spits out tobacco juice
          between his wide spaced front teeth.
          11 They are approached by a group of fifteen dock workers, 11
          Black's men, with massive shoulders and grain-sack bellies.
          Looks like they just got off their shift and now they're
          ready to kick some ass.DOCK WORKEROkay, against the car, ladies. You're
          c gonna stand for a search.
          12 The eight visitors assume the position, placing their 12
          hands on the roof of their car. The dock workers pat them
          down and haul off iron -- lots of it.DOCK WORKER #2Bunch a cuties.DOCK WORKER #3Put skirts on 'em, I'd marry one.
          From the other Dock Workers, hearty male laughter. The

          the arhythmic echoing scuffle of Skip's one shoe, as he
          continues to hop in place for balance.
          Smiley, after a watchful pause to make sure everyone is
          dead, sticks out his left arm at waist level.
          Skip grabs the arm for support, stops hopping, and there
          is now...total silence.ROBERT G. DURANTthe elegantly suited leader, takes out a cigar and a
          gold-plated cigar trimmer. SNIP--he trims the and of
          the cigar, and sticks it in his mouth.

          He is feeding the prints into the input slot of a
          computer.22P ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN: 22PThe nose is broken down into thousands of points. As each
          point of the nose is removed from the screen, a number is
          assigned.23 PEYTON 23PEYTONWe've finally got the Imager working

          He glances to...26 THE BIO-PRESS 26As it hums to life. It is a box containing linear rows of
          densely packed pins. Tiny servo-motors beneath the pins
          allow each pin to rise or fall individually, per computer
          command. A smooth synthetic substance is being sprayed
          evenly atop the surface of the pins. The sprays halts; the
          wet substance glistens. The densely packed pins rise to
          programmed heights, molding the solidifying synthetic
          substance into an exact replica of Yakatito's nose.9.27YAKITITO27No more bunching. Looks perfect.PEYTONI don't know about perfect, but it
          looks like your nose. Down to the

          breaks the surface of the fluid.107 WIDER 107A patient is lifted from a hydro tank, the complex water
          vessel in which burn patients are treated. He lies

          side effects to this operation. When
          the body ceases to feel, when so much
          sensory input is lost, the patient
          becomes alienated. The mind, cut off
          from its regular diet of input, has a
          never-satisfied thirst; alienation
          gives rise to loneliness, anger;
          uncontrolled rage is not uncommon.
          And the rage problem is exacerbated by
          the chemical effect of severing the
          nerve. Now, surges of adrenaline flow
          unchecked through body and brain--
          giving him the strength of dozen men.
