    day: nannies push strollers, joggers jog, mailmen deliver,
    dogs are walked, kids shoot hoop in wide open driveways.

    On a quiet, tree-lined street we pick up two young athletic-
    looking boys riding bikes. LASER ALLGOOD (15) and his
    friend, CLAY (15).

    Like bats out of hell they pass block after block of
    charming, evenly spaced houses until they round a corner and
    drop their bikes in front of a large ranch house.INT. CLAY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER2                                                                  2They walk inside.   We HEAR a baseball game on TV in another

    powder. Laser watches.LASERI don't know, dude.

    Clay cuts the powder into lines with a school ID card.CLAYB minus in geometry, yo!   This
              shits the bomb!

    Clay rolls up a dollar bill and takes a snort.   Then hands
    the rolled up bill to Laser.CLAY (CONT'D)Add it up, son.
    Laser takes the bill, bends over and snorts a line.INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - GIRL'S BEDROOM - DAY4                                                                  4Part Oxford reading room, part teenage girl's lair. Leaning
    against the bed we see JONI ALLGOOD (18). It's her room.
    She pours over a game of Scrabble.

    Sitting next to Joni is her best girl friend, SASHA, (18).
    Sasha's checking out Joni's FACEBOOK PAGE.2.Joni's best guy friend, JAI (18) sits across from her,
    calculating his next Scrabble move.SASHAOh my God, Joni, there are so many
              hotties in your class. You are so
              gonna hook up the first week.JAIJust cause you're a 24 hour drive-
              thru doesn't mean everyone else has
              to be...SASHAHey, she worked her ass off! She
              deserves some hot jock sausage!

              Whatever. Why don't you guys just
              do it and get it over with?

    Joni and Jai blush. They're both too scared to admit their
    crush on each other.SASHA (CONT'D)What? I'm just asking.JAIUh, maybe because we're friends...SASHAOh, really...?
    Sasha turns to Joni like an agent provocateur.INT. CLAY'S HOUSE - TV ROOM - LATER5                                                                 5Laser and Clay wrestle on the floor while Clay's DAD watches
    a baseball game on TV. They bump into the couch. Clay's dad
    looks back, menacing.CLAY'S FATHERHey, ladies! Take it down a notch.

    The boys keep wrestling, wired from the pills. Again, they
    knock into the couch. Clay's dad spins around, pissed.CLAY'S FATHER (CONT'D)What did I just say?!3.The Dad grabs Clay, pulls him off of Laser and over the
     couch. He gets his son in a headlock, forcing the boy's face
     into his big fat sweaty armpit. Both Dad and Clay enjoy the
     brutal play. Clay laughs manically.CLAYLet me go!CLAY'S FATHERDon't do the crime if you can't do
                the time.CLAYDad, your pits smell like burnt
                ass! Get off me!

     we note a trace of longing on his face.OMITTED.6                                                                  6OMITTED.7                                                                  7INT.

The women settle back.   Nic sees Jules feels bad.NIC (CONT'D)Look, I'm sorry. It's good you
          bought the truck. Its proactive.

Nic caresses Jules' arm, wanting to make it better.NIC (CONT'D)Hey...

Jules doesn't look at Nic.   She keeps her eyes on the T.V.NIC (CONT'D)Wanna watch a movie?

     mom's bedroom. She heads for the desk and stealthy opens a
     drawer. She rummages though with clear intention.

     Jules wrangles the blankets, trying to cover her partner.
