            cycles, dark helmets, faded blue jeans jackets embroidered
            with elaborate stitching of their club's insignia, cigarettes
            dangling from their hirsute mouths, baleful-looking
            countenances, revving their engines loudly, tauntingly.NEW ANGLE -From across the street, Marian, appearing like an apparition
            in her nightgown, surreally walks toward them, a beseeching
            look on her face.MARIANExcuse me.  Could you please turn your

            GO TO SLOW MOTION as the BIKERS, some ten in number, slowly
            approach the frail-looking Marian.  Gently, they pick her up
            off the ground and raise her aloft.  Then, like some moving
            human bier, they carry her through the forbidding black door
            into their clubhouse.INT. CLUBHOUSE - NIGHTWe follow Marian down a dark corridor leading into the bowels

                      and I was so worried about her ...
                      so, I went over and introduced myself. 
                      And they were the nicest people.

            Paula and Mr. Palmer exchange disquieting glances.MR. PALMER(playing along)
                      Well, that's a very unusual New York

            fantastical anecdote.CUT TO:INT. CO-OP - NIGHTPaula is sitting at the dining table with a plate piled with
            roast chicken, potatoes, and broccoli in front of her.  She
            has a worried look etched on her face.

            Marian is in the kitchen in the background, feeling light and
            happy, a singsong quality to her voice.  She brings a plate
            of food for herself to the table.MARIANAnd they were so friendly those young
                      men.  Though I do think they should shave
                      their beards and ... and get some nicer
                      clothes.

            Marian sits down at the table and takes a sip of her wine,
            picks up her utensils and gets ready to dig in.  She turns to
            Paula who isn't touching her food, her head in her hands. 
            Marian, seemingly oblivious of her daughter's feelings,
            prattles on.MARIANWhat do you say ... we take a subway
                      uptown and see a play tonight?

            Marian finally notices that Paula isn't listening.MARIANWhat's wrong?PAULAMom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine
                      such a thing, but ... how many of those
                      pills have you been taking?MARIAN(stung, taken aback)
                      Oh, that has nothing to do with it.PAULANo, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing
                      you too hard to do things on your own.

            Marian retreats into herself, sips her wine - as if she,
            herself, now wonders if she's lost her mind - and her buoyant
            mood deflates almost at once.PAULAThe, um, other night, I got up to get a
                      glass of water and you were standing by
                      the window talking to daddy.  I called
                      out to you, but you didn't answer.  You
                      remember?

            Marian doesn't remember, and her daughter's words pierce her. 
            She's afraid to object.PAULANew York is a ... it's a strange place in
                      the summertime.  The noise, the warm air,
                      it's ... easy to imagine things.

            Paula lays a reassuring hand on Marian's arm, talks to her
            condescendingly, as if she were a child.PAULANow, you know you didn't go into the
                      clubhouse, did you?

            Marian doesn't bother to argue, fearing anything she might
            say would compromise her.PAULA (CONT'D)It's okay.  Dad's dying put a lot of
                      stress on you.  But you're going to be
                      all right.  We're all going to be all
                      right.  Where did you get this vivid
                      imagination, huh?

            Paula grips Marian's arm a little tighter and shakes it
            gently as if snapping her back to reality.  Marian returns
            her a tight-lipped smile.FADE OUT.INT. CO-OP - NIGHTMarian, lying supine on the convertible sofa bed by the open

            five.  The Disciple mounts his Harley and is about to kick
            start it to life, when the Disciple Prospect rises from his
            stool.DISCIPLE PROSPECTYo, man!

            The Disciple Prospect raises two fingers to his lips in a
            kind of warning, then gestures up to Paula's co-op where
            Marian is sleeping.

            The Disciple, remembering the new rule, nods assent with a
            slightly annoyed expression.

            Then, he puts his Harley into neutral, dismounts, and starts
            slowly walking it down the quiet, ill-lit street.INT. CO-OP - NIGHTThe room is cast in soft ambient light from the street.

            Then, he helps Marian onto the back of the Harley she's going
            to be riding to the airport.  Gently, he places a helmet -
