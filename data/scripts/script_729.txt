                      What? What do I do?  Then What?DR. LANDONWell that's what Hospice will take care of
                      for you.  They will send a nurse, someone 
                      who can take care of all of that for you --LINDAHe has Phil right now.DR. LANDONPhil's one of the nurses from the service?LINDAYeah.DR. LANDONIf you're happy with Phil taking care
                      of him and helping you, that's fine, 
                      but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --LINDA-- you don't understand: it's more pain 
                      than before and the fucking morphine pills
                      aren't working, he's -- past two days it's 
                      like he can't really swallow them and I don't 
                      know if they're going down -- I can't see inside
                      his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring
                      at him and I don't think the pills are going
                      down and he moans and he hurts --DR. LANDONWe can fix that, because I can give
                      you -- are you listening?LINDAI'm listening.  I'm getting better.DR. LANDONDo you wanna sit down?LINDAI need to sit down.DR. LANDONOk. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it.
                      He's dying. He is.  He is dying very,
                      very rapidly -- 

     She breaks a bit more.DR. LANDONNow the thing here is making that experience 
                      as painless and easy as possible for him, 
                      you understand?  Now you need to get in touch 
                      with Hospice care because they can take care of
                      all those practical things that you're asking 
                      me about -- they are who you call when he dies. 

     He writes a number on his bussiness card, hands it over as they speak;DR. LANDONThis is the number for Hospice.
                      Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go,
                      there is something else to consider that
                      can take the pain away that he is in,
                      there is a very strong and very potent solution
                      of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle,
                      with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in
                      his mouth and drop on his tounge and 
                      it will certainly diminish the pain that
                      he is in but you have to realize that
                      once you give it to him; there really 
                      is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly
                      cure his pain, but he will float in and 
                      out of consciousness, even worse than he
                      is now, Linda.  I mean, any sign of the 
                      recognizable Earl will pretty much go away --LINDA-- how the fuck can I say anything 
                      to that -- I don't know what to say to that --DR. LANDONThe job here is to make him as comfortable 
                      as possible -- right now -- our job is to just
                      try and make it as painless as possible.
