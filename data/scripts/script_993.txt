                     Sir Arthur Conan DoyleSeptember 29, 20081.FADE IN:1   EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - NIGHT                                1Autumnal streets seen through the sooty glass of a STREET
    LAMP. Shadows within shadows. Fog in the air. Full
    moon.WATSON (V.O.)The year was 1891. London was the
               capital of the world -- the height
               of modernity, with the hiss of
               steam and smell of coal in the
               air. It was also the great
               cesspool into which all the
               sinners and criminals of the
               empire drained.

    Gas hisses audibly, the street lamp ignites, and casts a
    POOL OF LIGHT onto the street, silhouetting a MAN making
    his way through the fog and dark shadows with a lantern.WATSON (V.O.)I had come to London, ten years
               prior, to find a life after the
               Afghan war. I had hoped to start
               a medical practice and settle into
               a nice, steady existence. The
               life I found was anything but nice
               and steady.

    We can see that the MAN wears a cape. The distinctive
    silhouette of his deerstalker hat is unmistakable. A
    FURIOUS CLATTER OF HOOVES APPROACHES in the distance.
    The MAN tugs on a pipe and turns towards the growing
    stampede.WATSON (V.O.)And that had everything to do with
               one man. My friend, my partner,
               my burden...

    The MAN exhales a plume of smoke calmly, giving us the
    impression that he knows something that we don't.WATSON (V.O.)... Sherlock Holmes.

    WHAM! The MAN in the deerstalker hat is KNOCKED FLAT by
    A RUNNING MAN who has vaulted over a wall, sending him,
    his pipe, and hat flying across the cobbles.(CONTINUED)2.1   CONTINUED:                                                       1The RUNNING MAN leans down as if to assist, but instead
    just picks up the smoker's broken umbrella and studies
    it. The MAN in the deerstalker hat's eyes widen as he
    recognizes his famous assailant.MANSherlock Holmes?!

    SHERLOCK HOLMES offers the handle of the umbrella to the
    MAN, hauls him to his feet and hands back his broken
    umbrella.HOLMESMy apologies. Send the bill to
              John Watson, 221B Baker Street.

    Sherlock Holmes sprints off down an alleyway.   The MAN
    takes a step into the road to watch him go --

    -- and is nearly flattened for good by the first of a
    number of POLICE CARRIAGES, hurtling by on a serious
    pursuit, Victorian-style.2                                                                    2INT. CARRIAGE - CLOSEUP ON THE OFFICERS - NIGHTinside. Big, uniformed guys assemble their weaponry -- a
    19th century SWAT team. One man stands out as a leader,
    older than the rest, INSPECTOR LESTRADE.

    A man in plainclothes sits to one side of the officers:
    DR. JOHN WATSON, physically as tough as anyone else in
    the carriage, but with a more pensive air about him. A
    thinking man of action.3   EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - NIGHT                                   3Almost tipping over, the carriage turns onto the
    Embankment and hurtles through the writhing fog along the
    river.

    As the carriage banks, we see Holmes cut across the
    carriage path again, taking a line the horses cannot
    follow.CUT TO:ANOTHER ANGLEHolmes bursts out of an alley, sprints round a corner and
    runs across a courtyard to a side door.

    WE PULL BACK to see the FACADE OF ST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL.3.4   OMITTED                                                      45   INT. CATHEDRAL CRYPTS - ENTRANCE - NIGHT                     5Holmes enters through the door and stands at the top of a
    stairwell. He takes a moment to recover; he's fit, but
    not as fit as he used to be.

    Holmes descends the stairwell to a door and a spiral
    staircase beyond it. He stops at the doorway and peers
    round the corner.

    A lantern glow ascends the spiral stairway towards
    Holmes. Holmes withdraws into the shadows behind the
    door. A BOWLER-HATTED MAN ascends the stairs, carrying
    the lantern and a gun.

    He peers behind the door and holds the lantern up to the
    shadows, but does not see Holmes, who has pulled his
    black jacket up to conceal his face. The man swings the
    lantern away again. He peers about, confused.

    We see Holmes' eyes from the shadows, as he lowers his
    jacket and thinks through his plan of attack.HOLMES (V.O.)Head cocked to the left, partial
              deafness in right ear. First
              point of attack.PRE-VISUALIZATION IN VARI-SPEEDFOCUS ON the spot behind the man's right ear, just at the
    top of the jaw -- the most vulnerable point. Holmes
    launches a hammer blow, and we ramp from 24 fps to 400
    fps (ULTRA SLOW MOTION) as he makes contact. The man's
    head is thrown back as he spins round.HOLMES (V.O.)Then throat, paralyze vocal
              chords, stop screaming.

    BACK TO 24 fps. The man's mouth opens to cry out. We
    RAMP BACK UP TO 400 fps as his Adam's Apple is struck
    with a precision karate chop, strangling his scream.HOLMES (V.O.)Stink of alcohol, heavy drinker --
              knuckles to liver.

    BACK TO 24 fps, RAMPING TO 400 fps as a devastating
    knuckle-punch to the liver doubles up the bowler-hatted
    thug and crumples him to his knees.(CONTINUED)4.5   CONTINUED:                                                       5SECOND-TIME ACTION - SUPER FAST REPEAT OF ABOVEHolmes flashes out of the shadows, moving so fast that we
    can barely see what he's doing.

    THWACK! Hammer blow to ear.
    CRACK! Karate chop to throat.
    WHAP! Knuckle punch to liver.

    BACK TO NORMAL MOTION as the man crumples to the ground,
    Holmes takes his bowler hat from his head and flips it
    onto his own in one super fast move.

    Holmes drags the battered man into the shadows, lifts his
    lantern and proceeds down the spiral staircase.POV - BOTTOM OF THE SPIRAL STAIRCASEAnother bowler-hatted THUG approaches the bottom of the
    staircase. He has seen the lantern light. He draws his
    gun and approaches. Holmes places the lantern on the
    post at the bottom of the bannister, ducks down into the
    shadows.THUGWhat's goin' on, John?

    When he gets no answer, the THUG points his gun to where
    we saw Holmes hide.

    But Holmes appears from the shadows behind the THUG,
    reaches around him, grabs his gun hand and pistol-whips
    him twice with his own gun, dropping him.

    Holmes extracts a cigar from the Thug's top pocket and
    sniffs it appreciatively.HOLMESHhhmm, good cigar. Who do you
              work for?

    He jams the cigar in his own top pocket, picks up the
    man's bowler and proceeds on, further down into the
    crypts.6                                                                    6OMITTED7   INT.

              Is that your blood or theirs?HOLMESI don't know.    It's an old shirt.WATSONYou left this behind.

    Watson hands him his pistol.    Holmes looks at it with
    distaste, doesn't take it.HOLMESKnew I'd forgotten something.
              Thought I'd left the stove on.WATSONYou did.HOLMESRight.    Shall we?

He is more of a brawler,
     using headbutts, knees, and elbows. Less artful, but no
     less effective.8    OMITTED                                                      89    INT. CATHEDRAL CRYPTS - BALCONY - NIGHT                      9Thugs dispatched, Holmes and Watson look down and see a
     chilling sight.A WOMAN IN WHITE LIES INSIDE A CRUDELY-PAINTED PENTACLE(five-sided figure), lit with candles at each corner.
     Her eyes roll back in her head, trance-like. A sword has
     been placed at her feet.

     A HOODED FIGURE KNEELS INSIDE A DOUBLE CIRCLE next to the
     pentacle. This is LORD BLACKWOOD. We do not yet see his
     face.

     ANOTHER HOODED FIGURE stands on the edge of the ceremony,
     shrouded in shadow. We do not see his face.

     Suddenly, the woman rises up like a broken puppet, as if
     pulled to her feet by invisible hands.

     Some kind of ritual is about to climax.

     Holmes and Watson head down, fast, not caring if they
     make a noise or not. Their footsteps echo.9A                                                                9AINT. CATHEDRAL CRYPTSThe second hooded figure moves back and melts into the
     shadows.

     Still kneeling, still hooded, Blackwood chants softly,
     Latin incantation repeating and repeating.

     ON THE WOMAN as her lips start to move in time with the
     incantation. This is spooky, real, powerful stuff.

     Holmes and Watson leap from the stairs to Blackwood's
     level.

     Blackwood simply ignores them.   The Latin incantation
     never stops.

     Holmes is closer to the girl, Watson closer to Blackwood.WATSONThe girl.(CONTINUED)7.9A   CONTINUED:                                                     9AThe girl bends with alarming and mechanical suddenness,
     picks up the sword and turns it on herself, ready to
     plunge the point into her heart.

     Holmes lunges, grabs the woman's arm, disarms her and
     pulls her out of the pentacle. She collapses.

     Simultaneously and eerily the candles extinguish and a
     rush of air departs the tunnel.

     Blackwood throws back his hood. We finally see his face.
     His eyes are intense, he is tapped into something dark
     and cruel.

     Holmes and Watson are shocked at his identity.WATSONLord Blackwood?!
     Blackwood applauds softly, strangely.BLACKWOODWell done, Holmes. And Watson as
               well.

     Watson raises his gun, trains it on Blackwood.WATSONStay right there.

     Blackwood raises his hands in front of him, almost
     mockingly.BLACKWOODTell me, doctor, as a medical man,
               how did you like my work?
                    (beat)
               The fifth one was so scrawny, it
               was over before I'd finished the
               first incision.

     That's more than Watson can take.   He moves in to pistol-
     whip Blackwood --

     -- is stopped suddenly by Holmes' hand grabbing his
     collar.HOLMESNo.

     Watson struggles forward against Holmes' grip.HOLMESLook.(CONTINUED)8.9A   CONTINUED: (2)                                                9AHolmes seems to be pointing at Blackwood.   Watson looks,
     sees nothing.HOLMESLook.

     Watson looks, and sees it and his eyes flare wide.

     INCHES FROM WATSON'S RIGHT EYE is the needle-pointed end
     of a QUIVERING PIECE OF HIGH-TENSILE WIRE, almost
     invisible --

     -- the other end held between Blackwood's hands.    A
     really nasty concealed weapon.

     One more step and Watson gets impaled in the eye.BLACKWOODWhat a shame.    That would've been
               fun.

     We hear heavy boots on the balcony, as Lestrade and his
     men finally appear.

     POLICEMEN flood the area.HOLMESImpeccable timing, Lestrade.LESTRADE(vis Blackwood)
               Is that -- ?WATSONIt is.HOLMES(re: girl)

               corpse and chasing a rumor.
               Besides, the girl's parents hired
               me, not the Yard.
                    (a wry smile)

      Blackwood out of his double circle, put chains on him,
      while others carry the girl away on a stretcher. She's
      still mouthing the incantation.

      Lestrade eyes the double circle, the pentacle, shakes his
      head, not understanding them.

       floods back into the room.

       McMurdo senses his opponent's lapse in concentration and
       steps on Holmes' foot, tramping him and --

       He knocks Holmes down with a thunderous right.

       Holmes rolls over, stands, shakes his head to clear the
       cobwebs. He looks for the woman. She's gone. He turns
       back to McMurdo, smiles.HOLMESWell done.   Thank you.

       Holmes begins walking away.

       SPITS CONTEMPTUOUSLY at Holmes, catching him on the back
       of the head. The crowd falls silent.

       Holmes stops.     Feels the back of his head, smells his
       hand.HOLMESHm.   Plymouth gin.

       He turns.   Steps back into the ring.

       The crowd applauds, working into a fever pitch, but from
       Holmes' POV, all is calm. His eyes tick slowly, scanning
       McMurdo, locking onto the big man's knee:

       A little scar-tissue, nearly invisible.    As McMurdo
       braces for combat --

       Instantly Holmes unleashes a series of superfast moves,
       incorporating exotic martial arts. The blinding
       combination culminates with a spinning kick to the big
       man's knee, which buckles altogether wrong.

       McMurdo falls, over and out. Holmes is already turning
       away before the giant hits the canvas.

       He sees the crowd fall silent, they're not sure if they
       like it, there really isn't any sport. He doesn't care.

       Passing fellow fighters and flirty barmaids, Holmes
       strides out of the bar, battered on the outside, soothed
       inside. He grabs a bottle in his hand. Taking a huge
       swig, he climbs the stairs towards the upstairs rooms.18A                                                                   18AINT. PENTONVILLE PRISON - CORRIDOR - NIGHTA candle shivers, casting jagged shadows. A row of stone

     knee, keeps coughing.

     Finally the Captain COUGHS SOMETHING UP, spits it out
     onto the stone floor. He looks down, horrified:

     It's a small CATHOLIC CROSS on a chain.

     Prisoners start SHOUTING.   The RAVEN at Blackwood's

     look of resignation, he opens the door to see Holmes
     sitting alone in the sterile, barely furnished room.

     Holmes faces the corner, playing scales on his VIOLIN.
     On the table next to him, an upside down BEER STEIN and
     an assortment of prescription medicine bottles.

     Watson approaches, sees Holmes has bloodshot eyes from
     lack of sleep.

     Watson picks one of the medicine bottles which is open.WATSONYou know this is for eye surgery?HOLMESI find that it lifts my spirits.WATSONIt's a pathological amorbic
               process, it increases tissue

     landmarks as the city comes to life. They sit in
     silence, tension hanging between them. Finally Holmes
     grabs Watson's bag, rummages around and pulls out a clean
     white shirt.

     Watson looks out the window, frustrated. He sees THE
     HALF-CONSTRUCTED MASS OF TOWER BRIDGE. Near ground
     level, workers take down a large BLACKWOOD STEEL sign.HOLMESLook at that structure. What has
                 it been? Five years' work

                 the first combination of bascule
                 and suspension bridge. Very
                 innovative.

                silence, Watson. It makes you
                quite invaluable as a companion.

     Suddenly, Blackwood is right at the bars, close to
     Holmes.BLACKWOODSo now you're curious as to

     flicking around the room.

     He's in a grand office where a man in his late 60s, SIR
     THOMAS, rises from a pile of papers.SIR THOMASMr. Holmes, apologies for
                summoning you like this. I'm sure
                it's quite a mystery as to where
                you are, and who I am.HOLMESAs to where I am -- I was,
                admittedly, lost for a moment
                between Charing Cross and Holborn.
                But I was saved by the bread shop
                on Saffron Hill, the only bakers
                to use a certain French glaze on
                their loaves. After that, the

                every ounce of my not-

               procedure, I suppose.

     Holmes shakes his head; what a massive lack of judgement
     on their part.STANDISH (O.S.)I think we have the right man.

     Holmes turns to see JOHN STANDISH and LORD COWARD
     standing behind him. Standish is an American in his
     sixties. Coward is a hard, ambitious man in his 30s.(CONTINUED)57.72   CONTINUED: (2)                                               72SIR THOMASSherlock Holmes, Ambassador

     isn't impressed by rank.LORD COWARDI suppose you already have some

               our secret systems have steered
               the world towards the greater good
               for centuries. The danger is that

     Stunned, the men consult silently, come to some sort of
     conclusion. They turn back to Holmes. Sir Thomas seems
     especially shaken.SIR THOMASVery few people are privy to that
               information, and we want to keep
               it that way.

     Sir Thomas opens a bureau, digs for something.SIR THOMASHe was conceived during one of our

     pauses glancing briefly around the room before sitting at
     a mirrored dressing table. There's a decanter on the
     table next to her from which she pours herself a glass of
     wine.

     Then she begins removing an impressive assortment of
     WEAPONS hidden on her person: she pulls a stiletto from
     her garter, a Derringer from her waistband (which she
     puts down next to the wine glass). She pulls long thin
     needles from her hair, lets her hair down. As she
     continues...

     corner. He looks on silently until:IRENEIf you're going to watch me take

     Unbuttoning done, Holmes steps out to confront Irene.HOLMESI can't help wondering if your
               employer will be as content with
               these results? You were
               uncharacteristically ill at ease
               in his presence. Your hand was
               trembling, your gaze was averted.

               spotted chalk on his lapel. A

     Irene steps out, now wearing an array of Victorian
     undergarments. Unfairly gorgeous. The huge DIAMOND
     still around her neck. She moves back to the dressing
     table.

     case vehemently.HOLMESWhen a man you ask me to find ends

               highest levels of the British
               government. They will certainly
               consider your reticence to be an
               obstruction of justice. Which in

      Constable Clark continues in, Holmes swivels away --CONSTABLE CLARKWe've checked everything. No sign
                of a break-in. The Butler didn't
                hear anything. The body was in
                the tub, eyes wide open --

      back at the doorway, in full virtuoso detective mode.
      Right now, right here is where Holmes is at his very best
      -- this is, in fact, why he exists.

      Holmes is satisfied by what he sees or finds, continues
      into the bathroom, where a POLICE OFFICER stands over the
      tub and Sir Thomas' body (covered with a blanket).

      The tub has been drained. The kind of crime scene
      violation that Holmes cannot get them to stop doing.(CONTINUED)65A.78C   CONTINUED:                                                78CHOLMESWhy did you drain the water?POLICE OFFICEROut of common decency.HOLMES(incensed)
                Crime is common, logic is rare.
                The decent thing to do is catch
                the killer, not provide comfort to
                the corpse.

      Neither the officer nor Clark have a response. Holmes
      swivels, sees a JAR OF BATH SALTS on the table next to
      the chair Blackwood sat in, leans over, scoops it up,
      opens it, sniffs it.HOLMESHmm...

      Holmes thrusts the open jar under the Officer's nose.HOLMESWhat is that?POLICE OFFICER(smelling)
                Uhhhh... jasmine?HOLMESSuperb. I suspect this comes from
                a larger cannister. It'll either
                be in the pantry, high up where
                it's warm and dry, or in a linen

      Both cops hesitate -- Holmes is not their boss.HOLMESData, data, data! I cannot make
                bricks without clay!

      The cops hurry away. Now Holmes can really get down to
      work. This may mean he gets on his belly for a floor's-
      eye-view, it may mean he looks down from a window sill.
      Sometimes he hums or sings to himself.

     mud. Holmes doesn't seem bothered. Watson does.

     They look up and see a jetty that heads out into the
     river. Two shadowy THUGS guard the dock, while more
     THUGS are loading the boat with something.

     Holmes and Watson scuttle forward, towards the entrance,
     where two more THUGS patrol. Watson pulls out Holmes'GUN.HOLMESWhat are you doing with my gun?WATSONOh, please.HOLMESIt was an honest mistake --WATSONThere was nothing honest about it.

     Watson has already left. He simply walks up to the door
     and whacks the larger man in the face with the gun --
     before dispatching the other with a backhand pistol-whip.

     Holmes follows, notices that both men have hip flasks.
     He picks one up, takes a whiff, and pockets it as he
     follows Watson. He slows, sensing something behind him.
     He turns, looks at shadows. Nothing. And he enters --87                                                                 87OMITTED88   INT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - TUNNEL                      88Holmes walks towards Watson who stands in the doorway,

     plaintive wail. The twisted blades of slaughterhouse
     instruments glimmer in the darkness. A few RATS lay
     dead. A truly creepy scene. Holmes and Watson move
     through it.

     As they go, Holmes notices rows of empty tables. He runs
     his finger through a layer of dust, inspecting it.
     Quiet:HOLMESThey cleared something out of
               here, not minutes ago...

     Holmes slows, picks up one of the dead rats. He inspects
     it, sees something on its skin, some kind of dark spore.WATSON (O.S.)Holmes.   You need to see this.

     doors.(CONTINUED)76.89   CONTINUED:                                                     89Holmes pulls out a CIGAR-CUTTER, CLIPS off the rat's

     gears and blades and saws, lifeless and silent for now.
     An automated butchery on a grand scale. This is the
     killing floor. Huge hooks hang from chain belts on an I-
     beam, the ceiling, swaying softly, whispering in the
     wind.

     On the high walls, a huge number has been scrawled:     118.WATSONOne-eighteen.    It's a date, a
               time?

     Holmes shakes his head, his eyes narrow, ticking.HOLMESIt's chapter and verse.
               Revelation 1:18. `I am He that
               liveth, and was dead.'

     Another voice completes the passage, echoing from above:BLACKWOOD (O.S.)`And behold, I am alive
               forevermore, and have the keys of
               hell and of death. Amen.'

     Holmes and Watson follow the voice to see: BLACKWOOD in
     the rafters. Shadows hang heavy around him. Holmes and
     Watson react: this is the first time they've seen him in
     the flesh.BLACKWOODI cautioned you to accept that
                this is beyond your control. Now
                you see the truth for yourself.

     The hooks in the ceiling are shivering softly, strangely.
     Holmes tightens. Blackwood continues, his voice echoes,
     as the hooks move through the air, gliding on a track.BLACKWOODI want you to bear witness. At
               noon tomorrow, the world as you
               know it ends.

     the trigger. Click. Misfire.(CONTINUED)77.90    CONTINUED:                                                   90BLACKWOODAnd because I appreciate your

      Suddenly the whole machine starts up. Industrial-
      strength loud, movement everywhere, empty hooks jerking
      towards the processing line. Blades and gears and
      grinders churn.

      Watson's eyes go from Blackwood to --

      A pig carcass as it comes swinging out of the killing
      area, towards the SCORCHER (which scorches the carcasses
      with live flame).

      Then next carcass emerges --

      -- not a carcass, Irene. She is alive, for now. She
      hangs from two hooks on a track-line, her wrists shackled
      above her, her mouth gagged.

      Her eyes show terror until she sees them, then immense
      relief for a moment, then determination.

      Watson sprints ahead, looking for a shut-off switch.

      Holmes unties Irene's gag.HOLMESIt's your turn in shackles this
                time.

      Ahead of them, the pig carcass is scorched in an
      overwhelming burst of flame. Holmes and Irene are next.(CONTINUED)78.90A   CONTINUED:                                                  90AIRENEBut this time no key,

      Holmes notes that Irene's hands are shackled to separate
      hooks. It's going to take two actions to free her.

      The flame machine gurgles ominously, gearing up for the
      next blast.

      Watson sees a LEVER (PLEASE NOTE, NEW PROP!) that looks
      promising, turns to head for it -- then his eyes focus on
      a big canvas splatter cloth.HOLMESI've been meaning to ask you
                something --IRENEWell, I'm a captive audience.

      Watson rips down the splatter cloth, sprints to Holmes
      and Irene, tosses the cloth across the conveyor belt to
      Holmes --

      -- who wraps them up in the thick cloth just before the
      flames hit them.

      The heat is excruciating -- but the cloth protects them.

      Watson watches anxiously as the scorched cloth drops
      away, revealing that Holmes and Irene made it -- just.

      Relieved, Watson heads for the lever until "Oh Shit!" he
      looks ahead --

      -- sees the scorched pig carcass being dragged into a
      long, conveyor-belt-wide SCALDING TANK OF BOILING WATER.

      Decision time for Watson -- help Holmes and Irene, or try
      the lever? He goes for the lever, reaches it, pushes it
      all the way over --

      -- and the belt speeds up with a jerk.

      Watson hauls back on the lever, gets the belt back to the
      original speed, looks around for another possible off
      switch.

      Just as they reach the scalding tank, Holmes jumps off
      the belt (still opposite side to Watson), grabs Irene's
      legs and pulls her horizontal just before she's dragged
      into the boiling water.(CONTINUED)79.90A   CONTINUED: (2)                                              90AShe's suspended just above the boiling water, with Holmes

      nods. Irene sees it, too.

      beam. She hooks her feet over it, and is suspended
      upside down by her shackles and her feet --

      facing the other way just in time to avoid the gush of
      boiling water.

      As Watson holds Irene, he spots a small, but significant-
      looking SWITCH on the wall, painted red. (PLEASE NOTE,NEW PROP!)Watson helps Irene back onto the conveyor belt, leaves
      her for Holmes to deal with, sprints for the switch.

      Irene rides the belt upwards.   Holmes clambers the
      equipment, following her.

      Up ahead, the scorched, scalded pig carcass precedes
      them.

      Holmes darts through a trimming station, with CLEAVERS
      HANGING FROM CHAINS, grabs one, jumps onto the belt,
      catches up to Irene --

      -- just as they both see the pig carcass CUT IN HALFLENGTHWAYS BY A GIANT BANDSAW.Holmes wastes no time, swings the meat cleaver at the
      lock shackling Irene's left hand. Sparks fly as metal
      kisses metal, but that's all. She's still shackled.

      Then both of them see that Watson has reached the SWITCH.
      Whew!

      Watson looks at them with relief -- close one -- and
      pulls the switch down with a really satisfying CLUNK!

      her. They plummet downwards OUT OF FRAME.

       We PUSH IN ALL THE WAY, so that we CAN SEE that the
       Doctor is actually Holmes.

       There is something grotesque about his face, he hasn't
       completely removed his disguise. Parts of it hang down,
       obscuring him --

       -- but not obscuring the light of instability in his
       eyes. They begin to overflow with tears. He brushes
       them away then looks at his wet hand, horrified.94B-94E OMITTED                                                 94B-94E95     INT. PUNCH BOWL PUB - ATTIC                                   95Holmes enters, disturbed, pained.   Emotions swirling.

       He pulls out a newspaper with the story of Standish's
       death, the pages and strange sacrificial offerings (bone,
       hair, feather, fang) from Sir Thomas' house.

       Gathering himself, Holmes stands in the middle of the
       bare room and starts to lay out the clues he has on the
       floor. The Ox bone directly in front of him (at 12
       o'clock). The eagle feather to his right (at 3 o'clock).
       The human hair behind him (at 6 o'clock) and the Lion's
       fang to his left (at 9 o'clock).

       Then with a piece of charcoal Holmes draws a circle
       around each image and a circle directly in the center of
       the four other circles. He then draws lines which join
       the circles together in the shape of a cross.

       In the center circle he draws a pentagram (using wax from
       a burning candle?). Then he pours a ring of salt around
       that circle.

       He lights four candles (one at each point of the cross)
       then stands in the center of the circle.

       He pulls a pocket knife from his coat, opens the blade,
       cuts his thumb and allows the drops of blood to drip onto
       the ground just outside the circle.(CONTINUED)85A.95   CONTINUED:                                                    95Then he begins to chant. The words are eerily
     reminiscent of Blackwood's chanting.

     Suddenly one of the drops of blood bursts into flame in
     mid-air -- as it hits the ground, the circle around
     Holmes ignites, followed by a larger circle beyond that.BLACKWOOD (O.S.)And now it dawns on you, you begin

      American flag, then to Standish with his eagle-topped
      cane. Next to the feather he writes America.

      to Reordon's red hair. Next to it Holmes writes Man.

                comfortably, I shall begin. My
                initial approach was far too
                narrow. When Blackwood invited me
                to Pentonville prison, he
                suggested I widen my gaze and, at
                minimum, I have done just that.
                In fact, I may well have
                reconciled thousands of years of
                theological disparity. But that's
                for another time. Blackwood's
                method is based on a ritualistic
                mystical system that has been
                employed by The Temple of the Four
                Orders for centuries. To fully
                understand this system, to get
                inside it, I re-enacted the
                ceremony we interrupted in the

      log from the fire, it starts to smolder and fill the room
      with smoke.HOLMESFortunately, there is nothing more
                stimulating than a case where

      Smoke fills the room so that Holmes is concealed. Coward
      pulls a gun from the desk and moves to the window. He
      opens it to try and clear the smoke.HOLMESNo, but I don't care much what you
                think. I simply wanted to know

      Watson stands on the rear deck, pulling Holmes in on the
      rope. Irene is also present.

      When Holmes is level, Watson leans over and clips off his
      cuffs using bolt cutters. Clearly the whole escape has

      A black glass cylinder is housed in a metal cradle with

       -- and pinches tighter. A large-diameter water pipe
       angles down the tunnel wall, forcing Irene to turn
       sideways to continue.

       The sound of Holmes' footsteps drives her forward.

       And then the tunnel ends. The water pipe breaks off
       jaggedly in mid-air, next to Irene's head.
       The continuation of the pipe passes through solid brick
       at the end of the tunnel -- a dark, claustrophobic
       gamble. Irene hesitates for a moment, then slithers into

       breath the only point of reference.

       claustrophobic as it gets.

       rope hanging from the scaffolding above and swings off             
       the bridge. Blackwood steps to the edge with his sword

       Holmes swings back onto the bridge a few feet away from            
       Blackwood. He lands, whips off his scarf and twirls it             
       around Blackwood's arm, binding them together. They

       Holmes cast off towards the end of the bridge.                     

       Blackwood smiles. He grabs Holmes' gun (which Blackwood

       head. A black liquid (tar) begins to pour out in a
