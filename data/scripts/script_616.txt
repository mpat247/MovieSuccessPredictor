          Will (13), his older brother,   sits up in bed propped against
          a pile of pillows, surrounded   by tissues and sheets of

          sifts through junk as fast as he can: SHOE-POLISH, RAGS, a
          dusty bag of colored BALLOONS, a broken FLASHLIGHT, two
          mostly empty bottles of WINDEX, and an old can of TURTLE WAX.
                         
          George stops and gazes upon the CARTOON TURTLE with hypnotic
          wonder. CUT TO POV of something lurking in recesses of the
          basement, watching GEORGE framed in the light of the doorway.4.Sensing this, George snaps out of it, grabs the BOX OF
          PARAFFIN near the back of the shelf, and hurries back up the

          They both grin, the cozy room full of cheerful brotherly
          love. George kisses Will on the cheek, startling him.GEORGEThanks, Willy.
                         
          He goes. Will looks to the rain-lashed window, piano still
          playing. He's suddenly filled with a sense of foreboding.WILLBe careful out there!5.EXT. WITCHAM STREET - DAYA DEAD TRAFFIC LIGHT sways overhead, its dripping black
          lenses gazing back at A BOY IN A YELLOW SLICKER AND REDGALOSHES.Georgie races down the street past dark houses after his
          PAPER BOAT, which sluices along a gutter swollen with rushing
          rainwater.
                         
          Rain taps on George's hood sounding to his ears like rain on
          a shed roof, a comforting almost cozy sound. The buckles of
          his galoshes make a merry jingle as he goes.
                         
          The boat whistles past a blockade of sawhorses marked DEPT OF
          DERRY PUBLIC WORKS, where a gouge in the blacktop sends it
          sweeping diagonally across toward a STORM DRAIN.
                         
          George races after, trying to grab the boat before it's
          swallowed up with all the rainwater. He SLIPS AND SPILLS to
          the blacktop, crying out in pain.
                         
          The PAPER BOAT surfs up to the drain, circles around twice,
          and goes in. George look ready to cry.GEORGEWilly's gonna kill me.
                         
          He walks over to the drain and peers in, water falling into
          darkness. A dank hollow sound comes from within. Suddenly
                         
          EYES PEER BACK AT HIM -- from THE GREASY WHITE FACE OF A
          CLOWN. Not Bozo, or Ronald McDonald, but something more old
          world, freakish, like that of a 19th-century acrobat -- bald,
          lithe, almost child-like. Meet PENNYWISE aka BOB GRAY.
                         
          George recoils back, shocked by Pennywise's presence. A
          VOICE, a perfectly pleasant and reasonable voice, rises up.PENNYWISE (O.C.)Hello, Georgie.
                         
          George looks around him.
                         
          An OLD WOMAN watches him from the kitchen window of a house
          just behind the drain.
                         
          CUT TO: POV from the OLD WOMAN's house. She turns her
          attention back to her cat, scraping out the wet innards of a
          can of tuna into a plate on the window sill.PENNYWISE (O.C.) (CONT'D)Lost something?6.George expression mellows from fear to child-like wonder,
          like he's seeing a circus bear balanced on a ball .GEORGEHow did you get down there?PENNYWISEMe? Why the storm of course. Just
                    bleeeew me away. It blew the whole
                    circus away. How'd you like to join
                    the circus, Georgie?
                         
          The faint, off-key sound of CALLIOPE MUSIC can be heard.
          George inches closer to the storm drain.GEORGEIs there cotton candy?PENNYWISECotton candy? Oh yes. Cotton candy
                    and bearded women and elephant shit
                    and all the balloons a little boy
                    could want. You like balloons,
                    don't you Georgie?GEORGEI sure do. Do they float?
                         
          George takes one last fatal step forward.PENNYWISEFloat? Oh indeed they do, Georgie.
                    Indeed they do. Everything down
                    here floats. And when you're down
                    here with us...
                         
          The clown's sing-songy voice curdles into something horrible,
          primal even, as George's arm is seized by Pennywise's
          unusually LONG arm and CLAW-like hand.PENNYWISE (CONT'D)YOU'LL FLOAT TOO!George's SCREEEEEAAAAAM rings through the sewers as we...

          MAINE, settled on a crosscut of the Penobscot River and
          Kenduskaeg stream. It's a sturdy, picturesque Northeastern

          SEVERAL multi-acre, manure filled sheep pens stand empty.
          One has 50 sheep ready for slaughter, a path leading from the
          pen grows narrower as it feeds into an industrial complex
          designed for slaughter.EXT. HANLON ABATTOIR, OUTDOOR PEN - DAYLEROY HANLON (50s) works to move the sheep into line while

          He hands it to Mike, expectantly. Mike dispassionately takes
          the mechanism and approaches a sheep.MIKEBecause I want to be in boring

                    draw pictures in text books and

          himself to pull the trigger.

          Heroux pulls the ax out of his gut like you would a softwood

          another drink, kicks it away.
                         
          In back, Heroux turns to the last man cowering in the corner:
          Stugley Grenier. He takes a swing and Stugley ducks it, ax
          splintering the floor.
                         
          Stugley scrambles into the OUTHOUSE and closes the door
          behind. Heroux, now totally slicked with blood, stalks over
          and begins chopping his way in.
                         
          He finds the windowless room empty. A sound comes from deep

          Heroux steps out of the outhouse into the carnage of the back
          room. Exhausted and bloody from tip to toe, he takes a seat
          at the card table, props his ax next to him, and starts

          almost skin like. Underneath, thousands of spiders swim, nest

          Ben freezes, the spiders knowing he's there and gathering
          under his butt. Bev, Stan, Eddie and Mike look on from solid
          ground on the other side of the membrane.BEVERLYTake off your shoes. You'll be
                    fine. Just move real real slow.
                         
          Ben, Mike and Will take off their sneaks and crawl across the
          membrane with great care. SPIDERS GATHER wherever they press
          a knee or hand, the whole thing sloshing like a water bed.118.INT. BLACK HOLE - DAYTravis and Victor get to the corkscrew pass. There's no way

          He puts the knife into Victor's hand and points to keep
          going. For a split second Victor thinks about stabbing him,
          but he's too scared. He squeezes his rangy frame through the

          He freaks, spiders jumping on him, his motion only ripping
          the membrane more. It finally tears and Victor plunges
          beneath the membrane, spiders devouring him, Victor screaming
          in agony as they fill his mouth.

          Suddenly spiders start spilling out from behind the roots of

          In the center of the floor is a massive OCULUS, open to what
          appears to be the edge of INFINITE SPACE. The water from the

          with a CRYPT TYPE STRUCTURE.

          Will sees Beverly over by one of the waterfalls.BEVERLYGuess I'm going first again?WILLBeverly, wait-!
                         
          She jumps into the waterfall and it sweeps her up up up to
          the ceiling.
                         
          Will and the boys swap holy shit looks.   Ben jumps in after
          her, then Will, Mike, and Stan.
                         
          Richie looks to Eddie, who has the same terrified look as at
          the quarry. He holds out his hand.RICHIEYou still afraid of a little grey
                    water?EDDIEYou still wear diapers at night?
                         
          Eddie grabs Richie's hand and they jump into the waterfall
          together. They are swept up up up into...121.INT. THE REFLECTING POOL ON THE CEILING - CONTINUOUSPlunging into the pool with the others. For a moment they
          all flap and kick under water, unsure which way is up, then
          Bev grabs them both and pulls them to the surface.
                         
          They're upside down now, the oculus opening to space below

          The camera flips around and THE WORLD RIGHTS ITSELF, the
          oculus now above. The pool, which seemed small before, is
          now enormous -- like a dark, brooding lake -- the crypt
          island very far from them.MIKEThis is nothing like what it looked

          They splash toward the crypt island. Ben is the first to
          feel something brush past his leg. A replay of the quarry.BENNot funny, Richie.

          to his left.RICHIEWhat?
                         
          Ben suddenly realizes.   Bev also feels something on her foot.BEVERLYThe water. There's something in
                    the water with us.122.Suddenly a WORMY TENTACLE extends from the water behind Mike.

          The kids hustle it freestyle across the pool for the island.
                         
          WE PULL BACK WIDE TO SEE a monstrously big, faintly outlined
          starfish-like creature with an orange glowing eye, lurking in
          the depths of the reflecting pool.
                         
          Will, then Bev, then Richie dodge a tentacle and all get to
          the island. Stan is not far behind, with Mike, Eddie and Ben
          taking the rear, swatting back more tentacles.
                         
          From under Stan the ORANGE EYE APPEARS, the dark water around
          him suddenly aglow. He looks down into it and it becomes
          clear the eye is really a mouth, and the orange is coming
          from deep inside its bowels -- THE DEADLIGHTS.
                         
          Stan looks directly into them and is mesmerized, so much so
          that he stops swimming.WILL (CONT'D)Stan what are you doing!
                         
          Paralyzed, Stan starts to sink toward the deadlights when
          Mike, shielding his eyes, grabs Stan and swims him back to
          the surface.
                         
          All the kids give cover with their weapons -- shooting
          flares, swinging the sledgehammer, impaling with the stake,
          using the hubcap as a shield -- so that Mike, helped by Ben
          and Eddie, can drag Stan onto the island.EDDIE                             BEVERLYStan? Stan, are you okay?       Stan!

          Another tentacle squirms out of the water toward them. Ben
          shoots it with a crossbow. It goes slithering back in.BENGuys. I don't think this is the
                    best place to hang out right now.EDDIEStanley, snap out of it.123.Stan blinks conscious.   He looks at them all.STANWhere am I?RICHIEThe worst and only bar mitzvah

          for the monster.MIKEGuys, the water thing.    IT's gone.
                         
          Indeed, the reflecting pool is placid as ice.

          They all nod and follow Will onto the structure, starry deep
          space through the oculus visible over their shoulders. They
          come to a child-sized TRAP DOOR with an ancient, cosmic
          marking. The only way in or out.WILL PUTS HIS HAND ON THE LATCHWILL (CONT'D)Ready?124.The kids steal themselves, weapons ready. Mike hammers a

          flare, illuminating the chamber in a blood red pall. The
          walls inside are rough, like the surface of a meteor.
                         
          Directly under the trapdoor is a fountain like hole in the
          floor open to the reflecting pool. Floating on the water isGEORGIE'S PAPER BOATPennywise emerges from the shadows behind Will, clinging to

          see anything.
                         
          There's scuffling all around him. Close. Will dives into
          the water for the flare. Rises. Sweeps it around.NOTHING.WILLI'm not afraid of you, clown.PENNYWISEYour brother wasn't afraid either.

          Will drops his bag of flares and scrambles off, tripping over
          the hole in the floor, leg sloshing in the pool.
                         
          Glimpses of Pennywise scuffling in the dark like a spider.
                         
          Will finds a corner, the flare running out of spark. He
          waves it this way and that, illuminating the dark in front of
          him. Swinging his baseball bat wildly at shadows.WILL (CONT'D)Come out from the dark then. Come

          Will looks at the last light of his flare, waiting for the

          into...A BOY'S SEVERED ARMHe throws it away into the darkness.   The flare goes out.PITCH BLACKPENNYWISEOoooh I'd love to, Will. I'd just

          Will's eyes fall to the baseball bat half-way between them.

          Pennywise goes for a bite and...THWACKAn arrow shoots through it's face. The injured clown recoils

          Suddenly the GRAVITY SPELL WEARS OFF and the kids all fall to
          the ceiling of the stone crypt. Bev almost falls out into
          space, caught by Ben just in time.
                         
          The water from the waterfalls and from the reflecting pool
          all collapse back toward the floor, along with some of the
          stones in the crypt around them, which begins to crumble.
                         
          At first the losers hang on, afraid to fall, but eventually
          they lose grip and fall toward the oculus, which has begun to
          fill up with the water from the falls and reflecting pool.
                         
          They all plunge safely into the new pool below, Will's foot
          kicking out the bottom of it into outer space before being
          pulled back by Stan.WILLWe've got to get out of here.129.INT. DERRY SEWERS - DAYThe losers hurry their way out of the sewers, storm water
