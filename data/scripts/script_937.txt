          EYES. Expressive, alive. Human?
           No. They belong to a FEMALE CHIMPANZEE: BRIGHT EYES.EXT. GROVE OF TREES -- DAYShe sits in a tree with ALPHA, her mate - large and muscular,
          a PROMINENT WHITE BIRTHMARK ACROSS HIS SHOULDER, LIKE ASHOOTING STAR.Around them, under the TREE CANOPY, a COMMUNITY OF
          CHIMPANZEES naps, eats, plays.EXT. WEST AFRICAN JUNGLE - DAYA DOZEN POACHERS on horseback slog through the jungle.
          They're working towards the GROVE, visible in the distance.
          As they near it, the LEADER points, sending the MEN moving
          quietly, NETS and RIFLES ready.EXT. CANOPY - DAYAlpha sits up, sensing something. BIRDS take sudden flight.
          He stands on the branch and YELLS OUT A WARNING. FEAR
          ignites the community - but too late.
          POACHERS BURST INTO THE CLEARING, horses' hooves kicking up
          dirt. CHIMPS SCATTER.
          Bright Eyes wants to stay by Alpha's side, but he bares his
          teeth and sends her off.
          Then he drops, landing firmly on the clearing floor. All
          around him, POACHERS pursue terrified apes, nets swinging.
          MALE CHIMPANZEES jump up and down, SHOUTING AND SCREECHING -
          an aggressive show. A futile attempt to protect the tribe.
          Alpha zeroes in on a POACHER attempting to scoop up a YOUNG
          CHIMP. He streaks across the clearing, KNOCKS THE POACHERFROM HIS MOUNT.Alpha POUNDS his CHEST, letting out a BATTLE CRY -- trying to
          rally a counter-attack.
          But the other chimps pay no heed. There's no organization to
          the defense. It's chaos.
          SHOTS RING OUT. The Chimps mauling the Poacher drop, one by
          one. Others take off.2.Alpha spots Bright Eyes across the clearing, dragged off in a
          net. He RUSHES to save her, leaps in the air...A SHOT RINGS OUT.BRIGHT EYES WATCHES - HORRIFIED - AS ALPHA CRUMPLES IN THEAIR AND FALLS TO THE GROUND. LIKE A STONE.FADE TO WHITETWO FACES wearing SURGICAL MASKS lean in and peer down at us.

          Will looks from the monitor to Caroline. His look is
          intense, tough to read. She blushes slightly at the heat of
          his gaze.CAROLINE (INTERCOM) (CONT'D)She's an ape. Chimpanzees,

          sometimes.
          He's oblivious to this, instead intent on getting the scan
          right. The green liquid moves through the chimp's neck...TECHIEHere we go.

          Caroline holds up a picture of a tree for Bright Eyes, who
          sits at a table in front of a LEXIGRAM, a lit-up board with
          colorful symbols.

          ago. This was yesterday.

          Both on the frontal lobe and the
          neocortex.
          She's purposely standing close in order to point this out.
          He notices but doesn't respond - there's history between them
          and he's regretting that - gets in the way.6.WILLI see that. But I don't understand
          the primate behavioral norms. She
          knows an acorn's a seed. Wouldn't
          any monkey know that?CAROLINENo - it's conceptual. Acorn gives
          us a tree, which gives us an acorn.WILLAbstract thought...CAROLINEIn a chimpanzee. Unheard of.
          Will turns the possibilities over in his mind. Caroline
          moves away from him. He barely notices her now.CAROLINE (CONT'D)You're calling her a monkey just to
          piss me off, aren't you?WILLStart the other's on the 112.(BEAT)And double this one's dose.EXT. GEN-SYS LABORATORIES - DUSKWill climbs into his truck. Alone, he allows his excitement
          to show. Abstract thought!

          of an old military base.EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DUSK (AERIAL)Will drives over the majestic Golden Gate Bridge.EXT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHTWill pulls up in front of his house.
          Set in a hillside neighborhood, it's neat, nondescript. The
          home of a bachelor who hasn't given it much thought.
          As Will pulls into the driveway, WE HEAR C SHARP PLAYED OVERAND OVER ON A PIANO.7.INT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHTWALTER RODMAN, 60, sits at the piano dressed in a robe,
          stabbing at the key with his finger.
          Will enters, his posture almost visually changing with the
          emotional weight of this man, his father.WILLHey Dad.
          Walter looks up, whispers...WALTERJohn... is that you?WILLIt's me. Will.WALTERAs thou dost, Anthony.
          (staring at the keys)
          .he hears no music. No music...VOICE(heavy Russian accent)
          He's been doing that all day.
          A Home Aide enters, grabs her coat. This is IRENA.IRENAHe found an old book of his.
          She pulls a worn paperback of Julius Caesar from Walter's
          pocket. He snatches it from her, puts it back.IRENA (CONT'D)(shrugging on coat)
          I had no idea you liked Shakespeare
          so much, Mr. Walter.WILLMy mother was the one. She liked
          Shakespeare...IRENA(KISSES HIM)Good night, Walter, hone-ee.
          She heads out. Will gently takes his father's arm.I WILLCome on, Dad.8.INT. WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHTWill helps his father change into pajamas.WILLRemember I told you we were using
          Basic Fibroblast Growth Factors on
          the apes? Well the therapy seems
          to be working. We've seen definite
          signs of adult brain neurogenesis.
           Walter holds up his arms for Will to slide on the pajama top.WILL (CONT'D)Board of Directors is coming in a
           couple weeks to talk about Phase 2 -
          that's clinical trials.
          Walter gives no hint he's even listening, much less
          understanding what Will's saying.WILL (CONT'D)Human trials, Dad. Soon.WALTERI rather tell that what is to be
          feared than what I fear: for
          always... I am Caesar...
          There's no way to reach him tonight. Still Will tries..WILLI'm going to make you better - I
          swear it.
          His father looks at him. A moment of recognition?WALTERJohn... ?WILL(DISAPPOINTED)No, Dad, it's me. Will.
          Will helps the old man under the bedcovers.WILL (CONT'D)John's gone.
           He moves to the door, pausing to take in the diplomas on the
          walls - Walter's name on all of them. (Physics, Astronomy.)9.Will looks at his father lying there on his back, staring up
          at the ceiling. The once brilliant man now slipping away.INT. WILL'S STUDY - LATE NIGHTIt's late. Signs of a half-eaten frozen dinner on the desk
          beside numerous papers, charts, and Will's computer.
          He looks exhausted, gulps from a cup of coffee as he works.INT. PRIMATE LAB - DAYFranklin moves from cage to cage, greeting the apes.FRANKLINGood morning, Felix. Bam Bam.

          cage.FRANKLIN (CONT'D)You okay back there?CAROLINESomething wrong with Bright Eyes?FRANKLINI'll check on her when we're done.
          Franklin unlocks a cage and leads a CHIMP - LUCKY - into the
          next room, where Caroline waits beside the CT scanner.
          Lucky's head is shaved, exposing a long, curving scar on his
          cranium.
          From Bright Eyes' vantage point she can see through the open
          door as Lucky's strapped down.EXT. GEN-SYS GROUNDS - SAMEWill - dressed in an ill-fitting suit off the rack, hair
          brushed in an attempt at neatness - meets STEVEN JACOBS as he
          steps from a beautiful BLACK JAGUAR.JACOBSYou could at least try to look
          excited.010.Will's too nervous to look excited. He eyes the FOUR SUITS
          disembarking from nearby TOWN CARS.WILLI'm not good with this stuff.
          Jacobs puts a hand on Will's back, leads him inside.JACOBSYou'll do fine. Just speak
          English. Keep the science simple.INT. LAB - SAMEFrom the back of her cage, Bright Eyes watches through the
          open door as the ape on the table convulses.CAROLINEOkay. Back it out...DONNIEYour turn.

          Franklin looks over - he's still dealing with Lucky on the
          table...FRANKLINBe right over -
          Donnie looks closely at Bright Eyes. There's something
          different in her face today. Rage? Force of will?DONNIEWhat's the matter with you?INT. BOARDROOM - SAMEWill stands at the head of a table. A BIG PLASMA SCREEN
          behind him shows a BLOW UP OF A BRAIN SCAN. As Will speaks,

          to open the cage, once more she yanks it shut.
          Again he tries... and is taken by surprise when SHE GRABS HISHAND AND PULLS IT THROUGH THE BARS.DONNIEHey!!!
          Now Donnie's smashed up against the bars. Hard. The other
          apes begin to SCREECH.
          Donnie hasn't panicked quite yet, but he's about to.DONNIE (CONT'D)Someone get her off of me!CAROLINEHang on -
          Franklin struggles to hold onto Lucky as Caroline hurries
          over. He eyes the chimps in their cages - GOING CRAZY.INT. BOARDROOM - DAYWill continues his presentation. Stevens looks around at the
          board members - they're lost.WILLIn the past, it's been impossible
          to target specific areas, both

          Jacobs stands, interrupting Will.JACOBSWhat Dr. Rodman has done is to
          invent a virus that can, for the

          Franklin ignores him, steps inside Bright Eyes' cage. He
          moves to the very back and pulls aside a blanket.

          He shoves a PLASTIC 'PLAY REFRIGERATOR' across the cage

          Dodge and another animal wrangler, RODNEY, move from cage to
          cage, SHOVELING PRIMATE CHOW INTO TROUGHS. Rodney tosses in
          an occasional rotted vegetable.
          The APES enthusiastically receive the food. Dodge shovels
          food into Caesar's trough. Caesar stares down at the wet-
          looking dog food.DODGE (CONT'D)Mmmm mmm. Grade A primate chow.
          Bet you don't get none of that in
          the suburbs.
          Caesar reaches into the disgusting goop and THROWS A HANDFUL

          looks away so Dodge doesn't see him laughing too.49.DODGE (CONT'D)Think that's funny? That funny to

          back as a shield.
          The water BLAST is relentless.

          Make it happen.53.INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/CAESAR'S CAGE - MORNINGEarly morning sun through the tiny window of Caesar's cage.
          He wakes shivering with cold. Notices that the other cages
          are empty - that his cage door is open.
          Tentatively, he makes his way into the common area.INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/COMMON AREA - MORNINGCaesar looks around. No chimps. The hose lies on the wet
          floor, along with the detritus of feeding time.
          He can HEAR the APES in the distance.
          Caesar tries the GATE/DOOR to the outside. LOCKED. He
          pauses, then makes his way toward the BRIDGE.EXT. ATRIUM/BRIDGE - MORNINGCaesar walks across the bridge. To his left, (connecting to
          the bridge) he sees TWO MORE APE HOUSES CONNECTING TO THEBRIDGE:THE ORANGUTAN HOUSE - which is empty.
          And THE GORILLA HOUSE, which houses only one lone gorilla,
          BUCK, who stares out at Caesar. Caesar registers THE FACT
          THAT BUCK'S NOT OUT WITH THE OTHER APES. Then he moves on
          toward the atrium.
          The APES are visible inside. CAESAR GETS HIS FIRST GOOD LOOK.
          Over two dozen CHIMPANZEES and three ORANGUTANS roam around
          the atrium. The groups don't mix - chimps hang with chimps,
          orangutans with orangutans.
          They haven't noticed him yet.EXT. ATRIUM - DAYCaesar enters, heads for the tree. One by one, the apes take

          Should he continue to the tree? Go back to the cage?54.He spots a BALL across the way. Moves to it - the eyes
          follow him. He picks it up. The eyes wait.
           Caesar rolls the ball to a nearby chimp. It receives the
          ball, gives Caesar nothing - no smile, no connection - then
          tosses it to Rocket.
          Eyes on Caesar, Rocket discards the ball like a piece of
          trash. His look is insolent, an unmistakable challenge.AFRAID, CAESAR TURNS, HEADS BACK TOWARD HIS CAGE. ROCKETSWINGS OVER A COUPLE OF BARS AND LANDS IN FRONT OF HIM.Caesar tries to walk around. Rocket blocks his path, reaches
          out and pulls at Caesar's sleeve, as if to examine the
          material. Caesar jerks his arm away.
          Rocket bares his teeth, raises his arms.
          Caesar considers the options - should he run? Before he can
          make a move, Rocket GRUNTS, grabs his shirt at the chest.
          Caesar tries to push Rocket away, but the larger chimp throws
          Caesar to the ground, pinning him.
          Caesar struggles to get away, accidentally SLAPPING Rocket
          across the face.
          OUTRAGED, Rocket SLAMS his hand on Caesar's chest and starts
          POUNDING him. Caesar tries to block the blows, but they're
          coming hard and fast: his head, his stomach, his chest.
          Apes SHRIEK, jump up and down, egging Rocket on.
          Caesar manages to break loose, crawling away. Rocket grabs
          at his shirt, drags Caesar closer.
          He opens his mouth wide, moving sharp teeth toward Caesar's
          face. Caesar struggles, barely holds him off - and....ROCKET BITES HIS ARM. BLOOD SPURTS.BAM! A SHOT RINGS OUT. Chimps scatter.
          Stunned, Rocket spins around - HIS MOUTH FULL OF CAESAR'S
          BLOOD - AND SEES DODGE OUTSIDE THE CAGE, RIFLE IN HAND. He
          pulls a TRANQUILIZING DART from his shoulder.
          Caesar starts to move off -BAM! DODGE SHOOTS A TRANQUILIZER DART INTO THE SIDE OFCAESAR'S NECK - HE GRABS AT THIS THROAT AND FALLS.BAM! DODGE SHOOTS ROCKET AGAIN.55.Caesar rolls over to look up... as Rocket topples onto him.

          his toe.
          There's a GRUNT and a WHIRL OF BLACK FURRY MOVEMENT. Caesar
          finds himself staring into the huge, angry gorilla face.
          Caesar - nervous - beckons toward the open door.
           Buck understands but can't believe it. For a moment he
           doesn't move. Caesar makes the gesture again -- "Come on,

          Then he begins to run. He runs as fast as he can, all the

          Maurice glances over the bridge railing. The Bay churns and
          swirls hundreds of feet below.
          Caesar BARKS at Maurice, who then climbs over the railing,
          taking the orangutans and a handful of chimps with him.
          Caesar BARKS a command at BUCK - who waits by the last car
          with a PACK OF GORILLAS and some chimps.
          Then Caesar starts to climb. Shimmying up a cable and into

          BULLETS can be heard RICOCHETING off cables.
          Another chimp falls to its death.
          Then a heavy patch of fog rolls in, engulfing the middle part
