          Henry closes the window, watches the car disappear. He
          downs the last of his coffee, looks back out at the

          His wife, DEBBIE, is in the kitchen. She's wearing a
          NURSES uniform. Henry notices the dining room table set
          for one for breakfast. Eggs, bacon, sausage. He's a

          She looks at him.DEBBIEBecause I know you did once.
          A very long pause. Henry doesn't do anything now.

          UNIFORMS. One of them is puking. Behind them TWO more
          GUYS sit in the back of the car.
          Henry recognizes the smiling, pock-marked face of EDDIE
          VIBES. Two parts charm, one part menace. His puking
          friend is JOE.EDDIEHenry Torne.HENRYEddie Vibes.EDDIESo how you doin', man?HENRYI'm okay.

          He starts to retch.JOE(holding it in)
           I'm sorry.DEBBIEYou better come with me.
          Eddie glances at Henry as Debbie leads him expertly
          toward the bathroom.EDDIEGoddamn sausage at Pinwheels.HENRYYeah.EDDIESo we're in a little bind, Henry. Got
           league playoffs in a half-hour and Joe's

           game-ready as you can see...HENRYYeah.

           shape.HENRYOh.
          Beat.EDDIESo what do you say?
          Henry looks around the room. For a moment he watches
          Debbie with Joe in the bathroom, the door half open.
          She's tending to him, caring for him...
          Debbie looks up. Sees Henry staring at her.EDDIE (CONT'D)Henry?INT. IMPALA - LATERHenry drives. He wears Joe's too small softball uniform.
          Eddie rides shotgun, the other two in the back. They

          Eddie and the guys get out. Henry notes this is strange.7.After a moment Henry realizes something stinks. He sniffs
          his sleeve.BEHIND HIMIn the rearview, Henry doesn't notice Eddie and the two
          guys slipping on SKI MASKS...HENRY'S POVA PET STORE OWNER rolls up the security gates of his
          store and enters. He says good morning to all the
          animals. It's a strange one man show.LOUD ALARMS BLARE --Henry startles, looks back to where the sound's comingFROM :THREE GUYS IN SKI MASKSFly out of the bank on the corner and scatter in various
          directions. They're all wearing softball uniforms. A BANK
          GUARD chases them.
          ON HENRY, confused.
          A second bank guard FRANK (50s, African-American) is
          crossing the street toward the bank with two coffees. He
          sees what's going on, drops the coffees, and pulls his gun :FRANK (O.S.)You!
          Henry turns forward again.A GUNIs pointing at him through the windshield.FRANK (CONT'D)Freeze!
          Henry slowly raises his hands off the wheel.
          Frank sucks his teeth, his gun trained on Henry as the
          distant sound of BLARING SIRENS grows louder.
          Holding on Henry's stunned expression...INT. POLICE STATION, INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHTHenry sits at a small table as a DETECTIVE, whose face we
          never see, paces back and forth.DETECTIVEHenry, we know this wasn't your deal.8.Henry just listens.DETECTIVE (CONT'D)All you have to do is give me those
           names. And you can go home. It's that
           simple.
          Henry's still silent.DETECTIVE (CONT'D)Come on. Why are you sticking up for
           these people? They're not your friends.
           You've got a wife. You've got a job...
           don't you care?(THEN)All you have to do is say something.
          Henry looks up at him, making eye contact for the first
          time.JUDGE (V.O.)...in light of the fact that this is a
           first offence...INT. BUFFALO COURTROOM - DAYHenry stands in a suit, flanked by his state-appointed
          ATTORNEY. Debbie sits in the gallery.
          A JUDGE stares at Henry.JUDGE...the court sentences Henry Torne to
           four years in prison for the crime of
           Felony 1st Degree Armed Robbery.WHACK!The gavel goes down.
          Henry blinks. He looks at his lawyer who is pleased with
          the sentence. He pats Henry, well done.
          Henry looks back at Debbie. She's just staring at him...CLANK!A CELL DOOR is SLAMMED SHUT...INT. PRISON CELL - DAYHenry, wearing a prison jumpsuit, watches as the guard
          locks the door in front of him.MAX (O.S.)So. What're you in for?9.Henry turns.HENRYHuh.MAXI said what are you in for?
          A beat.HENRYBank robbery.
          MAX (60s) pulls up his pants, flushes the TOILET.MAXGood. Clean. Simple. I like it.
          Henry just watches.HENRYBut I didn't do it.
          Max smiles. Goes to the sink. Washes his hands.MAXAh. Mistaken identity. A perennial
           favorite. Identities are just constructs,
           anyway. They're mistaken all the time.
          He dries his hands. Presents one of them to Henry.MAX (CONT'D)I'm Max.HENRYHenry.MAXGo on. Make yourself at home.
          Henry sits down on his bed.HENRYSo...what are you in for?MAXLife.
          A beat. It's starting to hit Henry...MAX (CONT'D)Don't worry, you'll get used to it.10.INT. PRISON CELL - MORNINGAll the cell doors SLAM open. Henry startles awake. Max

          A GUARD, seeing Henry still in his bunk, bangs his baton
          against the bars of the cell.INT. DINING ROOM - DAYMax and Henry move along a line of convicts waiting for
          their food.MAX`Monday is whole wheat bun-day.'
          Henry's lost in thought...MAX (CONT'D)What are you thinking about?HENRYNothing.MAXYou're thinking something. Let me guess.
           You're thinking, `How did I get here?'
          Henry puts out his tray.MAX (CONT'D)How do you think any of us got here?HENRYI'm not sure.MAXI'll tell you how. Because we committed
           crimes. But we committed to the wrong
           thing. You see that was our mistake. We
           didn't fulfill our potential, we got
           angry and we took it out on other people.
          A bald, TATTOOED GANG-BANGER walks right past them to a table.MAX (CONT'D)See him?11.Henry nods.MAX (CONT'D)Hector. He wanted to be a doctor. He
           could've been, but he chose not to fulfil
           his potential, he chose not to commit to
           his dream. And now look at him.(THEN)Bad choices, see.
          Henry does.MAX (CONT'D)By the way, I recommend the potatoes.INT. DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATERMax and Henry sit down at one of the long tables.MAXThat's the real crime, Henry. Not
           committing to your dream.
          They begin to eat.MAX (CONT'D)So what's yours?HENRYMy what?MAXYour dream.HENRYNot sure I ever had one.MAXNever had a dream? What kind of a life is
           that?HENRYI don't know. A pretty good one?MAXHenry, you're in jail.
          Henry thinks about that. Puts a piece of potato in his mouth.EXT. YARD - DAYMax and Henry walk through the crowded prison yard.MAXBut here's the good news. We got all this
           time to do. And time is a medium of
           exchange. You can buy things with it.(MORE)12.MAX (CONT'D)Knowledge. Self respect. Forgiveness. And
           in your case, you can figure out what
           your dream is.
          Max takes his arm :MAX (CONT'D)Your dream is your truth is your destiny.
          Henry looks at him.HENRYI told you. I'm here by mistake.
          Max shoots a look back at him.MAXThere are no mistakes.
          Max suddenly glimpses some activity over Henry's shoulder.HENRYWhat?
          Several convicts are making their way towards them...
          He pulls Henry close, his tone suddenly intense :MAXBut you're going to have to fight for
           that dream, Henry.HENRYI am.MAXYou're at a crossroads now. There are
           going to be tests!HENRYWhat tests?CRAACK!Henry's punched in the side of the head. The inmates grab
          him, throw him to the ground next to Max.MAXThis is your moment. Whatever you do now
           defines you. Go get em!
          Henry gets up : CHARGES the inmates, arms swinging,
          taking several down. He gives it everything he's got.
          They pile into him, pummeling him. Henry just keeps
          fighting...but it's hopeless.
          GUARDS rush in. Max watches.13.INT. MAX AND HENRY'S CELL - NIGHTHenry lies on his bunk, his face battered and bruised.MAXYou did good, Henry.HENRYI don't feel good.MAXYou're doing better than you feel.
          Henry touches his swollen eye. It stings.MAX (CONT'D)Go to sleep, Henry.(BEAT)Sleep is for the blessed.INT. PRISON TIER - NIGHTOne by one we see lights blinking off across the vast
          string of cells.FADE OUT :INT. VISITING AREA - DAYHenry's wife Debbie sits at one of the metal visiting
          tables. She's dressed up. She's really made an effort.
          A door opens, Henry appears. He looks different. Some
          time has passed. He smiles, walks over. Then sits.DEBBIEHi.HENRYHi. You look beautiful.DEBBIEThank you. How are you doing?HENRYI'm okay. How about you?DEBBIEI'm good.
          A beat.DEBBIE (CONT'D)Listen, Henry. I have something I need to
           talk to you about.14.HENRYOkay.DEBBIEI fell in love.
          Henry takes that in.HENRYOh.

          He thinks.HENRYNo.
          He looks at her.HENRY (CONT'D)I want you to be happy.DEBBIEYou too, Henry.
          No one moves.EXT. PRISON YARD - LATER THAT DAYHenry sits on a bench alone, processing what just
          happened. He looks up at the sky. Gray and empty.
          Max arrives, sits down next to Henry, carefully puts a
          hand around his shoulder.MAXI ever tell you I was married?
          Henry turns to him.15.MAX (CONT'D)I mean nearly. I had a lovely
           correspondence going with Jocelyn
           Steinberg in Utica. Problem was when she
           finally came on visitor's day she said I
           was too short.
          Henry thinks.HENRYBooks and covers.MAXRight. Books and covers.CUT TO:TWO YEARS LATERINT. MAX AND HENRY'S CELL - DAYThere's music on a radio. Pull back to reveal Henry
          sitting on his bunk. He's grown a beard.
          Their cell has temporarily been converted into a
          makeshift BARBERSHOP.
          CONVICTS of various races wait to get their hair cut by
          Max the Barber.
          Max holds up a mirror to his customer, FINK.MAXClean as a whistle.FINK(checking himself out)
           Max, I think you missed your calling.MAXThank you.(THEN)Who do we got next, Henry?
          Henry checks the schedule by his side, calls out a name.HENRYHector. You're up.
          Standing just outside, A GUARD watches the make-shift
          barbershop carefully.
          Hector takes his seat. Max wraps a sheet around his neck.HECTORHey, Max. When are you up for parole?16.MAXOctober.HECTORShow us what you did for the board last
           time.MAXI'm working.
          The other INMATES egg him on.OTHER INMATESShow us!MAXLeave me alone.INMATESCome on! Show us.
          Max finally puts his clippers down.MAXAll right, so I'm sitting there, and the
           head of the board asks me what I'm going
           to do if they let me out this time. And,
           so...
          Max's face starts to shudder...his shoulders jerking back
          a little bit...MAX (CONT'D)I get this twitch! and then I give him my
           answer: "I'm gonna break in your house, set
           your dog on fire, eat all your food, go on
           a naked rampage through your garden, dance
           in the streets of your l'il hometown like a
           crazed harpee, hurl myself headlong flaming
           through the ethereal sky like God's blackest
           angel and explode like a goddamn heavenly
           fireball!
          Eyes ablaze and face beetroot red and twitching like a
          mad man...MAX (CONT'D)Oh, yeah. You don't want ME. You don't
           want THIS. Not out THERE.
          The inmates look slightly scared. Max casually picks up
          his clippers and smiles :MAX (CONT'D)Believe me, I'm not going anywhere.
          They crack up. A beat.17.HECTORHey, White Shadow. When's your review
           coming up?HENRYNext month.HECTORYou gonna do the twitch like your cellie?HENRYNope.HECTORWhat, you don't like it around here?MAXEveryone knows Henry's innocent.

           crime.HENRYI didn't do the crime.HECTORHey, but you got the time...so you may as
           well have done it.
          Everyone laughs.MAXI like it! `You got the time, so you may
           as well have done the crime!'

           dream was, Max.18.MAXI'm living it.HENRYReally?MAXSure! It's easier to live in here. You
           don't have to do anything. You just show
           up. In fact they even do that for you.
           I'm living the life.HENRYThis place is horrible, Max.
          Max thinks, lathering his hair...MAXSo why didn't you just say something?HENRYWhen?MAXBack then. When you had the chance. When
           you were still innocent.HENRYI thought maybe this was my way out.MAXAnd was it?HENRYYeah.MAXSee. There are no mistakes.INT. MAX AND HENRY'S CELL - MORNINGIt's early morning. Henry's clean shaven, dressed in
          street clothes. He packs the last of his things into a
          sports bag, zips it up.
          Looks over at Max whose eyes are closed. Max looks
          vulnerable, like a child, the coverlet pulled right up to
          his neck.MAXYou got everything, kid?HENRYYeah.
          Henry, silent for a moment.19.HENRY (CONT'D)Maybe you should think about getting out
           of here sometime. I'll buy you a cup of
           coffee on the outside.MAXThe only thing I've ever missed in twenty
           three years is a hot bath. And that ain't
           worth walking out of here for.
          The cell door slides open.PRISON GUARD (O.S.)Torne! Let's go!
          Henry starts to leave.MAXDon't forget. Your dream is your myth is
           your truth.

           my destiny.MAXJust testing.
          Henry continues...stops at the door.HENRYI'm going to miss you.MAXYeah, well. I hope I never see you again.
          Henry smiles.HENRYI'm still gonna miss you.MAXGet out of here, Henry.EXT. PRISON - DAYIt's cloudy. Henry walks through the front GATE of the
          prison. He takes a long deep breath of free air. It's

          look like they were done by a kid -- Debbie appears with
