            He scoops up the newspaper and glances towards the door -DENIS (CONT'D)Watch out. She's on the prowl.
            MARGARET looks beyond DENIS to a a sense of growing
            commotion. A concerned POLICE GUARD coming up the stairs
            meeting JUNE [early 60's] MARGARET's carer, along a
            distant corridor, steady on the approach.MARGARET(to DENIS)

                      important -

            MARGARET looks out of the kitchen. Her POV down the
            corridor of JUNE and the POLICEMAN and a CLEANER.3JUNE (CONT'D)Please just make it really clear.
                      Who's on after you?POLICE GUARDDixon.

            MARGARET's eyes move back along the rail in front of her,
            her fingers touch hanger after hanger of brown tweed and
            grey twill.

            JUNE goes over to the curtains, pulling them back,
            letting in the sunlight-JUNEBeautiful day. Oh, you've made a
                      start. Carol's coming soon, I'll
                      get some bags. Anything you want
                      to go to Mark, I'll bring up a
                      suitcase for it.

            The smell of smoke lingering. Suddenly DENIS' hand
            reaches across, wavering between jackets of brown tweed
            and grey twill-

            He reaches for a suit.MARGARETNo no no no. The grey.DENIS (O.S)You sure?

            The swipe of a clothes brush, briefly seen, drawn across
            one sleeve-MARGARETYes.

            Distant footsteps-MARGARET (CONT'D)...Definitely the grey.

            JUNE returns, oblivious-4DENIS (O.S)Righty ho. Boss knows best.

            JUNE spies the newspaper, sees the photos of twisted
            carnage on the front page.DENIS (CONT'D)Don't let her take my paper away.

            JUNE reaches one hand out to scoop it up in passing-MARGARETOh, I haven't had a chance to look
                      at that yet, dear.JUNESorry.

            JUNE hesitates, leaves the newspaper resting on the bed
            as she heads off with the suit on a hanger.DENISAtta-girl.

            DENIS smiles as he stands in the bathroom doorway,
            soaping his face with shaving cream-

            He hums to himself as he resumes shaving until-DENIS (O.S) (CONT'D)Damn.

            MARGARET looks up, DENIS has nicked his chin-MARGARETBlot it...Blot it..

            She turns, sees JUNE, through the ajar door, standing in
            the corridor, looking back at herJUNESorry ?INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.A comfortable drawing room, filled with the photographs

            MARGARET stands by the window, half a dozen of DENIS'
            ties in her hand. Pulling back the net curtain, MARGARET
            peers out-

            Two POLICEMAN stand down below next to a Police BMW car.
            They are lost in conversation, pointing to the door,
            clearly concerned.5One POLICE MAN nods to the other, a sense of the changing
            of the guard as he drives off in the BMW.

            SUDDENLY from behind-DENISNow look what you've done. Are
                      they to keep the loonies out or
                      you in?

            MARGARET eyes DENIS, looking at her with wry smile -DENIS (CONT'D)I'll be off then.MARGARETWear your scarf. There's a chill
                      out there.

            Suddenly looming over her and grinning down as if at the
            top of a tunnel SUSIE, MARGARET's personal secretary
            carrying a cardboard box.SUSIEGood morning Lady Thatcher. Are
                      you alright ?

                      bombings.MARGARETYes. Frightful.

            SUSIE's mobile goes off.    She fumbles in her bag to
            switch it off.SUSIESorry.SUSIE (CONT'D)These are the books for you to
                      sign. I brought as many as I could
                      find. Shall we go through your
                      appointments?

            MARGARET looks at her still nonplussed.SUSIE (CONT'D)We said we'd go through them
                      today.6MARGARET nods-MARGARETYes, of course, dear. Today.SUSIEThe invitation has come from
                       Downing Street for the unveiling
                       of your portrait. I'll put it on
                       the mantelpiece, and there's an
                       invitation from Lord Armstrong for
                       lunch on the first Friday of next
                       month.

            The murmur of SUSIE's voice, a kind of white noise-SUSIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)I said no because you've got a
                       concert that afternoon but if
                       you'd like to..?SILENCE-SUSIE(O.S) (CONT'D)....It looks like a very
                       interesting programme.

            MARGARET's listens, oddly distracted-MARGARETWhat are they playing?

            SUSIE looks at her momentarily at a loss then scrabbles
            back through the diary-SUSIEI think they said Rogers and

            below. He looks up, smiles,MARGARET (CONT'D)He hasn't got his scarf on.

            MARGARET throws DENIS a half wave. In return, he twirls
            his umbrella and does a couple of steps of a Chaplin walk
            for her benefit before passing the Postman who is
            shuffling through his letters as he approaches the front
            step, below.

            She passes the photographs of her predecessors and stops
            to receive a gift, opening it-MARGARET (CONT'D)What's this then? A radio... How
                      useful.

            She moves down the receiving line of staff. The floor is
            carpeted with roses. Men's wet eyes. The door ahead. She
            is crying.91Finally reaching the door, MARGARET stands bracing
            herself. Denis's hand on her shoulder standing behind.DENISSteady, MT.

            MARGARET nods, bracing herself. A hand on the door

            DENIS's clothes are all over the room and the main
            cupboard is open and empty apart from shoes. There are
            several bin liners already filled with clothes.MARGARET (CONT'D)Don't they know if you take the

                      you out with the rubbish!

            MARGARET turns away from this thought and opens a last
            big chest of drawers.MARGARET V/O(seizing shirts and
                            jerseys and putting

            She sits at the end of her bed and opens a box she has
            found in Denis's cupboard. There is a programme from `The
            King and I' and a faded blue rosette from some long
            forgotten election campaign. A small flyer `Margaret
            Roberts. Conservative Candidate for Dartford' and some
            childrens cards "to the world's greatest Daddy love Mark
            and Carol."MARGARET V/OAll I wanted was for my children
                      to grow up well and be happy -
                      happier than I was certainly. And
                      I wanted you to be happy of
                      course. Were you happy, Denis?
                      Tell me the truth.

            There is no response. MARGARET is momentarily lost in the
            room.

            Then, seized by some compulsion, she begins to pull out
            the rest of his clothes, shoving them into black bags.

            As shirts and trousers go in, quick flashes of Denis -93His youthful face, smiling at her at the opera.

            Laughing on the beach in Cornwall.

            At the door of Number 10, smiling at her.

            Sharing her bed.

            MARGARET looks up. Denis's suitcase is on the bed. His
            coat and hat lying beside it. She folds his dressing gown
            - the one from the bathroom hook - tenderly and puts it
            on the top of the case.MARGARETDenis? Denis?

            And there he is by her side.MARGARET V/OHere's your bag. You're all
                      packed, sorted.

            She walks him to the bedroom door and gives him a gentle
            kiss. DENIS starts to walk away.MARGARET(seeing he is walking away in his
                      socks)

            The SQUEAK of her wet cloth, working on a stubborn tea
