                             Deborah Moggach1 INT. NETHERFIELD - HERTFORDSHIRE - DAY. IA vast mansion is coming to life. Maids pull dustsheets
          off furniture; servants open shutters. Sunshine spills
          into the great rooms of Netherfield. outside, a glimpse
          of rolling parkland.TITLE:"It is a truth universally
          acknowledged...

          Its a whirlwind of activity. Servants bustle around,
          sweeping and polishing, readying the house for its new
          occupants. The shutters of a room are opened onto the
          imposing gardens. A coach pulls up and, through the
          window, we see a young man get out.

          "that a single man in possession of a
          good fortune, must be in want of a wife"

          A white sheet is pulled from a spinet and obscures our
          vision.CUT TO:2 EXT. LONGBOURN HOUSE - DAY. 2Elizabeth Bennet, 20, good humoured, attractive, clearly
          nobody's fool, walks through a field of tall meadow
          grass. She is reading a novel entitled 'First
          Impressions'. She approaches Longbourn, a fairly run down
          17th Century house with a small moat around it. Elizabeth
          jumps up onto a wall and crosses the moat by walking a
          wooden plank duck board, a reckless trick learnt in early
          childhood. She walks passed the back of the house where,
          through an open window to the library, we see her mother
          and father, Mr and Mrs Bennet.MRS BENNETMy dear Mr Bennet, have you heard that
          Netherfield Park is let at last?
          We follow Elizabeth into the house, but still overhear
          her parents' conversation.MRS BENNET (CONT'D)Do you not want to know who has taken it?MR BENNETAs you wish to tell me, I doubt I have
          any choice in the matter...2.3 INT. LONGBOURN - CONTINUOUS.As Elizabeth walks through the hallway, we hear the sound
          of piano scales plodding through the afternoon. She walks
          down the entrance hall past the room where Mary, 18, the
          bluestocking of the family, is practising, and finds
          Kitty, 16, the second youngest, and Lydia, 15, the
          precocious baby of the family, are listening at the door
          to the library.LYDIA(TO ELIZABETH)Have you heard? A Mr Bingley, a young man
          from the North of England, has come down
          on Monday in a chaise and four.KITTYWith five thousand a year!
          Jane, (the eldest, most beautiful and most charmingly
          naive of the girls), joins them at the door.JANEGoodness!LYDIA- and he's single to be sure!INT. LIBRARY - LONGBOURN - CONTINUOUS.Mr Bennet is trying to ignore Mrs Bennet.MRS BENNETWhat a fine thing for our girls!MR BENNETBow can it affect them?MRS BENNETMy dear Mr Bennet, how can you be so
          tiresome! You know that he must marry one
          of them.MR BENNETOh, so that is his design in settling
          here?
          Mr Bennet takes a book from his table and walks out of
          the library into the corridor where the girls are
          gathered, Mrs Bennet following.4 INT. CORRIDOR - LONGBOURN - THE SAME.Mr Bennet walks through the girls to the drawing room
          pursued by Mrs Bennet.3.MRS BENNET- So you must go and visit him at once.5 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 5Mr Bennet walks to the bookshelf to replace the book he
          is carrying. Mary is there practising the piano. The
          girls come in to listen.LYDIAOh, yes, Papa.KITTYPlease, Papa!MR BENNETThere is no need, for I already have.
          The piano stops. A frozen silence. They all stare.MRS BENNETYou have?JANEwhen?MRS BENNET• How can you tease me, Mr Bennet. You have
          no compassion for my poor nerves?MR BENNETYou mistake me, my dear. I have a high
          respect for them; they are my constant
          companions these twenty years.MRS BENNETIs he amiable?KITTYIs he handsome?LYDIAHe's sure to be handsome.ELIZABETH(IRONICALLY)With five thousand a year, it would not
          matter if he had a big pink face.MR BENNETI will give my hearty consent to his
          marrying whichever of the girls he
          chooses.LYDIASo will he come to the ball tomorrow?4.MR BENNETI believe so.
          Lydia and Kitty shriek with excitement.KITTY(TO JANE)I have to have your spotted muslin,
          please!LYDIAI need it!KITTY- if you do, I'll lend you my green
          slippers.
          Mr Bennet winks at Elizabeth and turns to Mary, a
          serious, somewhat pedantic young woman.MR BENNETAnd what do you say, Mary? Are you not
          excited by the prospect of a ball?MARYSociety has claims on us all, Papa. As
          long as I have my mornings to myself, I
          consider an interval of recreation and
          • amusement as quite desirable.
          Elizabeth laughs.6 INT. ASSEMBLY ROOMS -- MERYTON VILLAGE - NIGHT.The local subscription dance is in full swing. It's a
          rough-and-ready, though enthusiastic affair...yeoman
          farmers, small-time squires with their ruddy-cheeked
          daughters.
          Lydia and Kitty, with their mother, are fussing over
          their clothes - straightening their dresses, tidying
          their hair and so on.LYDIA(fussing over her dress)
          I literally can't breathe its so tight.KITTYMy toes hurt.
          Elizabeth and Jane are a little apart from their family.
          Jane looks breathtaking.05.ELIZABETH• Well, if every man in this room does not
          end the evening completely in love with
          you then I am no judge of beauty.JANEOr men.ELIZABETHOh, they are far too easy to judge.JANEThey are not all bad.ELIZABETHHumourless poppycocks, in my limited
          experience.JANEOne of these days, Lizzie, someone will
          catch your eye and then you'll have to
          watch your tongue.ELIZABETHAnd eat my hat.
          She stops speaking. And stares. A dazzling group enters
           the room: George Bingley, 25, a good hearted soul but
          • prone to bumbling embarrassment when his enthusiasms get
          the better of him, his sister Caroline, 23, a victim of
          every latest fashion, counting herself superior to most
          company she encounters, and finally, Mr Fitzwilliam
          Darcy, 27, dashing, brooding with an introversion which
          could be misconstrued as hauteur. They are dressed in the
          highest fashion. Darcy surveys the hall. He catches
          Elizabeth's eye. She stares, with a kind of surprised
          shock. Jane notices and looks at Darcy. He turns away.JANELuckily, you are not wearing a hat.
          A hush falls as the local people turn to stare. The
          newcomers - creatures from another world - make quite a
          stir.CUT TO:Caroline Bingley, standing next to Darcy, gazes at the
          somewhat provincial gathering with distaste.CAROLINE BINGLEYWe are a long way from Grosvenor Square,
          are we not, Mr Darcy?
          He does indeed look superior to the assembled company. On
          the dance floor a young couple, staring at the newcomers,
          trip over each other, stumble and burst out laughing.6.Mr Bingley spots Jane Bennet. For a moment he forgets
          himself and openly looks at her.MR BINGLEYI find it very charming.CAROLINE BINGLEY(TO DARCY)My brother is so easily pleased, is he
          not?
          Darcy does not answer.CUT TO:Elizabeth has found her great friend Charlotte Lucas - an
          intelligent, sensible woman in her late twenties. They
          spy through the crowd.ELIZABETHSo which of the painted peacocks is our
          Mr Bingley?CHARLOTTEHe is on the right, and on the left is
          his sister.ELIZABETHAnd the person with the disagreeable
          expression?CHARLOTTEThat is his good friend, Mr Darcy.ELIZABETHPoor soul.CHARLOTTEOn the contrary, he has ten thousand a
          year and owns half of Derbyshire.CUT TO:Sir William Lucas, 53 a hale but unsophisticated member
          of the self-made gentry, takes it upon himself to
          introduce Mr Bingley and Mr Darcy to his daughter
          Charlotte and the Bennet family.SIR WILLIAM(to Mr Bingley)
          My eldest daughter you know, Mrs
          Bennet ...miss Jane Bennet, Elizabeth and
          Miss Mary Bennet.MRS BENNETIt is a pleasure. I have two others but40they are already dancing.7.MR BINGLEYDelighted to make your acquaintance.�SIR WILLIAMAnd may I introduce Mr Darcy.(SIGNIFICANT LOOK)-- of Pemberley, in Derbyshire!
          A stiff bow from Darcy, Elizabeth smiles, Darcy does not.CUT TO:Moments later. Elizabeth is standing in a small group
          with Jane, Bingley, Miss Bingley and Darcy. Bingley can't
          keep his eyes off Jane, but is frightfully at a loss in
          disguising his instant ardour.ELIZABETHHow do you like it here in Hertfordshire,
          Mr Bingley?MR BINGLEY(smiling at Jane shyly)
          Very much.ELIZABETHThe library at Netherfield, I've heard,
          is one of the finest in the country.�MR BINGLEYYes, it fills me with guilt.
          He looks at Jane a little blush starts around his collar.BINGLEYNot a good reader, you see. I like being
          out of doors. I mean, I can read, ofCOURSE -His sister steps in. as the blush threatens to engulf his
          ears.MISS BINGLEY(TO DARCY)Your library at Pemberly, Mr Darcy, is
          astonishingly good.DARCYThank you. It is the work of many
          generations.MISS BINGLEYAnd then you have added so much to it
          yourself.08.JANEI wish I read more, but there always
          seems so many other things to do.BINGLEYThat's exactly what I meant.
          He beams at Jane.CUT TO:Mr and Mrs Bennet stand a little apart from Elizabeth and
          the other young people. Lydia and Kitty bound up to them
          in a state of high excitement.LYDIAMama! The regiment is arriving next week!KITTYAnd will be here for the whole winter!
          Mrs Forster told us!LYDIAThey're going to be stationed in the
          village!CUT TO:Mr Bingley'turns to Jane.MR BINGLEYMay I have the honour?
          They leave, to dance.ELIZABETHDo you dance Mr Darcy?DARCYNot if I can help it.
          Elizabeth, Darcy and Miss Bingley stand in silence as
          they over hear the following...CUT TO:LYDIAofficers! Lots of officers!KITTYHow will we meet them?LYDIAIt's easy. You just walk up and down in
          front of them and drop something.
          Lydia pantomimes the actions for Kitty.9.LYDIA• They pick it up. You say 'oh thank you
          sir' and blush prettily and then you're
          introduced!MR BENNETI have long suspected that we have two of
          the silliest girls in the county.MRS BENNETOh Mr Bennet! I remember the time when I
          liked a red coat myself, and if a smart
          young colonel with six thousand a year
          should want one of my girls I shall not
          say nay to him.
          Mr Darcy overhears this. Profoundly embarrassed, Lizzie
          moves away.CUT TO:The dance floor. Mr Bingley is dancing with Jane. His
          ears blushing with thrilled embarrassment. Mrs Bennet,
          with a group of other mothers, watches the young couple
          with rather too obvious satisfaction.MRS BENNET7 That dress becomes her, does it not. 7
          • Though of course my Jane needs little
          help from couturiers.
          Elizabeth wanders through the throng. She looks at
          Bingley and Jane ending the dance - she is coy and
          demure, he clearly smitten -CUT TO:Darcy is joined by Bingley exhilarated by the dance.BINGLEYCome Darcy, I must have you dance. I hate
          to see you standing by yourself in this
          stupid manner.MR DARCY(shakes his head)
          You know how I detest it.MR BINGLEYUpon my word, I've never seen so many
          pretty girls in my life.DARCYYou are dancing with the only handsome
          girl in the room.�10.BINGLEYOh, she is the most beautiful creature I
          ever beheld, but her sister Elizabeth is
          very agreeable.
          They have stopped at the edge of the dance floor and have
          not seen Elizabeth and charlotte who are standing close
          behind them. Elizabeth smirks as she overhears their
          conversation.DARCYPerfectly tolerable, I dare say, but not
          handsome enough to tempt me.
          Elizabeth's smile drops.DARCY (CONT'D)You had better return to your partner and
          enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting
          your time with me.
          Bingley goes off.CUT TO:Elizabeth and Charlotte, who have overheard Darcy and
          Bingley's exchange.CHARLOTTEIgnore him, Lizzie, he is such a
          disagreeable man it would be a misfortune
          to be liked by him.ELIZABETHDon't worry. I would not dance with him
          for half of Derbyshire.CUT TO:Later. Bingley politely dancing with Charlotte. As he
          does so, he catches sight of Jane dancing with somebody
          else. A look of pure longing, but he cannot dance every
          dance with her. Lizzie too is dancing and clocks this.
          Lydia and Kitty are exuberantly dancing too, laughing and
          chatting. Darcy stands watching, a look of infinitely
          superior boredom on his fine features.CUT TO:Bingley is standing with Jane, Elizabeth, Mrs Bennet and
          Darcy.BINGLEY(TO LIZZIE)Your friend Miss Lucas is a most amusing
          young woman.11.ELIZABETH• Yes! I adore her.MRS BENNETIt is a pity she is not more handsome.ELIZABETHMama!MRS BENNETBut Lizzie will never admit she is plain.(TO BINGLEY)Of course it's my Jane who's considered
          the beauty of the county.JANEOh, Mama, please!MRS BENNETWhen she was only fifteen there was a
          gentleman so much in love with her that I
          was sure he would make her an offer.
          However, he did write her some very
          pretty verses.ELIZABETH(IMPATIENTLY)And so ended their affection. I wonder
          • who first discovered the power of poetry
          in driving away love?DARCYI thought that poetry was the food of
          love.ELIZABETHOf a fine, stout love it may. Everything
          nourishes what is strong already. But if
          it is only a thin, slight sort of
          inclination, I'm convinced that one good
          sonnet will starve it away entirely.
          Darcy looks at Elizabeth with surprise. A glimmering of
          interest.DARCYSo what do you recommend, to encourage
          affection?ELIZABETHOh dancing, of course. Even if ones
          partner is barely tolerable.
          She gives him a dazzling smile. Darcy looks startled. He
          has no idea she heard him. He blushes.�CUT TO:12.Elizabeth is dancing happily in a round, Jane and Bingley
          • are also in the same dance. At the edge of the dance
          floor Darcy is watching.7 INT. BEDROOM -- LONGBOURN - NIGHT. 7Elizabeth and Jane are both tucked up in the same bed,
          but are too excited to sleep.JANEMr Bingley is just what a young man ought
          to be. Sensible, good humoured -ELIZABETH(completing the list)
          Handsome, conveniently rich -JANEYou know perfectly well I do not believe
          marriage should be driven by thoughts of
          money.ELIZABETHI agree entirely, only the deepest love
          will persuade me into matrimony, which is
          why I will end up an old maid.JANEDo you really believe he liked me,
          Lizzie?ELIZABETHJane, he danced with you most of the
          night.JANEI was flattered, I must admit. I did not
          expect such a compliment.ELIZABETHThat is one great difference between us.
          Compliments always take you by surprise.
          Well, Mr Bingley is certainly very
          amiable, and I give you leave to like
          him. You've liked many a stupider person.JANELizzie!ELIZABETHYou're a great deal too apt to like
          people in general, you know. All the
          world is good and agreeable in your eyes.013.� JANENot his friend. I still cannot believe
          what he said about you.ELIZABETHMr Darcy? I could more easily forgive
          his vanity had he not wounded mine. But
          no matter. I doubt we shall ever speak
          again.
          She blows out the candle.8 INT. BREAKFAST ROOM - LONGBOURN - DAY. 8Mrs Bennet presides over breakfast with an endless
          description of the ball. Mary is doing some needle work,
          whilst Lydia, Kitty and Jane blearily eat.MRS BENNETAnd then he danced the third with Miss
          Lucas. Poor thing, it is a shame she is
          not more handsome. The fourth with a Miss
          King of little standing. And the fifth
          again with Jane.MR BENNET• If he'd had any compassion for me he
          would have sprained his ankle in the
          first dance.MRS BENNETOh, Mr Bennet! Anybody would think the
          girls looked forward to a grand
          inheritance.
          Elizabeth rolls her eyes at Mr Bennet, they've heard this
          speech many times before.MR BENNET(NOT LISTENING)Kitty, be so kind as to pass the butter.MRS BENNETAs you well know, Mr Bennet, when you
          die, which may in fact be very soon, our
          girls will be left without a roof over
          their head nor a penny to their name.ELIZABETHOh Mother, please! It's ten in the
          morning.
          Mrs Hill enters the room and interrupts Mrs Bennet's
          • babbling.14.MRS HILL• A letter addressed to Miss Bennet, Ma'arn.
          From Netherfield Hall.MRS BENNETPraise the Lord! We are saved.
          Mrs Hill gives the letter to Jane.MRS BENNET (CONT'D)Make haste, Jane, make haste. 0 happy
          day!JANEIt is from Miss Bingley.
          Mrs Bennet is stopped in her tracks.JANE (CONT'D)She has invited me to dine with her.(PAUSE)Her brother will be dining out.MRS BENNETThis is most unfortunate.LYDIAI didn't think he was so good looking
          anyway.JANECan I take the carriage?MRS BENNETCertainly not my dear, you will go to
          Netherfield on horse back.JANEHorseback?!
          Mrs Bennet leaves with a secret smile on her lips.9 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY. 9Jane rides through the countryside, A distant rumble of
          thunder. She looks up...10 EXT. FIELD - DAY. 10An open book. Plop plop! Raindrops fall on it. Drawing
          back, we see Lizzie walking through a field, reading. She
          looks up to the sky...015.011 EXT. LONGBOURN - DAY. 11Mrs Bennet stands at the kitchen door. A boy is
          delivering meat. It starts to rain. She puts out her
          hand, to check.MRS BENNET(smiles, satisfied)
          Ah, good...
          The housekeeper, Mrs Hill, who is with her, looks bemused
          at her mistress's reaction.12 EXT. GARDEN - DAY. 12A louder rumble of thunder. A washerwoman hastily pulls
          clothes from a line...it's bucketing down heavily now...13 EXT. MERYTON VILLAGE - DAY. 13In the local.village people run for cover; shopkeepers
          cover up their wares...• 14 EXT. LONGBOURN - DAY. 14Mr and Mrs Bennet look out at the pouring rain.MRS BENNETExcellent. Now she will have to stay the
          night. Exactly as I predicted.MR BENNETGood grief, woman. Your skills in the art
          of match-making are without question.ELIZABETHThough I don't think, mama, you can
          reasonably take credit for making it
          rain. Let's hope she hasn't caught her
          death before she gets there.15 INT. NETHERFIELD - DAY. 15A footman opens the great doors to find Jane standing
           there soaked. she sneezes.16 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - DAY. 16• Elizabeth reads a letter.16.ELIZABETH• "And my kind friends will not hear of me
          returning home until I am better -- but do
          not be alarmed excepting a sore throat, a.
          fever, and a headache there is nothing
          wrong with me." This is ridiculous.MR BENNETWell, my dear, if your daughter does die
          it will be a comfort to know it was all
          in pursuit of Mr Bingley.MRS BENNETPeople do not die of colds.ELIZABETHThough she might well perish with the
          shame of having such a mother.
          Mr Bennet laughs.ELIZABETHI am going to Netherfield at once.MRS BENNETNonsense, the horse is with Jane. And the
          girls took the carriage to town.ELIZABETHThen I will walk there. We should not
          leave Jane alone in her condition.MRS BENNETWalk! You will not be fit to be seen by
          the time you get there.MR BENNETWhy the devil not. We could have them all
          laid up at Netherfield Hall.ELIZABETHI will be fit for Jane which is all I
          care about.17 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY. 17Elizabeth strides across vast muddy fields, slipping as
          she goes. Netherfield is in view on the horizon. She
          stops to take it in, then carries on down an even more
          muddy track.18 INT. NETHERFIELD -- BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY.�In the large grand dining room Caroline Bingley and Darcy
          are eating breakfast.17.Its very formal, in fact frigid, compared to the
          volatile Bennet household. Darcy is reading the
          • newspaper; Caroline Bingley is reading a letter.CAROLINE BINGLEY(puts down the letter)
          Apparently, Lady Bathurst is redecorating
          her ballroom in the French style. A
          little unpatriotic, don't you think?
          Mr Darcy is about to answer when the door opens. A
          footman appears, his face rigid with disapproval.FOOTMANMiss Elizabeth Bennet.
          Lizzie comes in, her face flushed, her skirt covered in
          mud. She looks ravishing. Darcy stares at her, then
          quickly rises to his feet. Caroline Bingley, astonished,
          looks her up and down.CAROLINE BINGLEYGood Lord, Miss Bennet. Have you walked
          here?ELIZABETHI'm so sorry. How is my sister?DARCY(MORE KINDLY)She's upstairs.(TO FOOTMAN)Show Miss Bennet the way, Alfred.
          Lizzie leaves. A beat.CAROLINE BINGLEYGoodness, did you see her petticoat? Six
          inches deep in mud!
          No response.CAROLINE BINGLEYAnd her hair, so blowsy and untidy!DARCYI think her concern for her sister does
          her credit.
          A little pause, Caroline recovers.CAROLINE BINGLEYOh yes, its shocking to have a bad cold.
          I dislike excessively being ill myself.018.• 19 INT. NETHERFIELD LANDING - DAY. IElizabeth is taken upstairs. Bingley, looking tense,
          waits outside her sister's room. His face lights up when
          he sees her.BINGLEYMiss Elizabeth! Oh I'm so glad to see you
          A doctor comes out of Jane's room.ELIZABETH AND BINGLEY(TOGETHER)How is she?DOCTORA violent cold, but we shall get the
          better of it.20 INT. NETHERFIELD - JANE'S BEDROOM - DAY. 20Elizabeth goes into the bedroom where Jane lies in bed,
          feverish and ill.ELIZABETHJane!
          Jane's face lights up. Elizabeth kisses her.JANELizzie! Oh, your face is so cold. They're
          being so kind to me, I feel such a
          terrible imposition.ELIZABETHDon't worry. I don't know who is more
          pleased at your being here, Mama or Mr
          Bingley.
          Bingley comes in having attended to the doctor.ELIZABETH (CONT'D)Thank you for tending to my sister so
          diligently, it seems she is in better
          comfort here than she would be at home.BINGLEYIt is a pleasure, I mean not to see her
          so sick, of course, that's terrible. I
          will have a room made up for you. You
          must be our guest here until Jane
          recovers.�19.�21 INT. DRAWING ROOM - NETHERFIELD -- DAY. 21Darcy is quietly reading as Bingley paces about
          anxiously. Caroline berates him from the sofa.CAROLINE BINGLEYStay!? She is a perfectly sweet girl but
          save being an excellent walker, there is
          very little to recommend her.BINGLEYI thought she showed remarkable spirit
          coming all this way.CAROLINE BINGLEYThe eldest Miss Bennet, as you know, I
          hold in excessive regard and I wish her
          well settled. Though I do fear with her
          families low connections there is little
          chance of it. Their uncle is in trade,
          you know, in Cheapside.BINGLEYIf they had uncles enough to fill all
          Cheapside it would not make them one jot
          less agreeable.22 EXT. GARDEN -- LONGBOURN - DAY. 22Mr Bennet is overseeing the gardener who is pruning the
          hedge. Mrs Bennet bustles up. She looks very pleased with
          herself.MRS BENNETWell, my dear, its all going according
          to plan. He's half in love with her
          already!MR BENNET(a touch disingenuously)
          Who, my sweetest?MRS BENNETMr Bingley! And he doesn't mind that she
          hasn't a penny, for he has enough for the
          two of them.
          Suddenly a distant trumpet sounds, dogs bark. The militia
          are arriving. Lydia and Kitty rush past. They are dressed
          up to the nines to greet the officers. Mrs Bennet's face
          lights up.• MRS BENNETWait for me!20.And she's gone. Mr Bennet gazes at their departing
          • figures.23 EXT. MERYTON VILLAGE - DAY. 23Mrs Bennet and her two daughters rush down the street
          into the village. Dogs bark, children run alongside as a
          regiment of soldiers march through the street. Geese
          scatter; shopkeepers stand in their doorways. The two
          Bennet girls simper at the handsome young soldiers. Mrs
          Bennet, flushed and excited, runs panting behind them.
          Lydia deliberately drops her hankerchief. One of the
          soldiers stands on it. She is appalled.24 INT. DRAWING ROOM - NETHERFIELD - EVENING. 24Elizabeth is reading a book. Darcy is writing a letter.
          Bingley is sat nervously. Caroline, obviously bored,
          wanders the room looking for distraction. She looks over
          Darcy's shoulder.CAROLINE BINGLEYYou write uncommonly fast, Mr Darcy.MR DARCY(without looking up)
          • You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.
          Caroline Bingley lingers, annoyingly.CAROLINE BINGLEYHow many letters you must have occasion
          to write, Mr Darcy. Letters of business
          too. How odious I should think them!DARCYIt is fortunate, then, that they fall to
          my lot instead of yours.CAROLINE BINGLEYPlease tell your sister that I long to
          see her.DARCYI have already told her once, by your
          desire.
          Lizzie looks across from her book.CAROLINE BINGLEYI do dote on her, I was quite in raptures
          at her beautiful little design for a
          table.�21.DARCY�Perhaps you will give me leave to defer
          your raptures till I write again. At
          present I have not enough room to do them
          justice.
          Mr Bingley now pacing anxiously around the room.MR BINGLEYIts amazing, how young ladies have the
          patience to be so accomplished.CAROLINE BINGLEYWhat do you mean, Charles?MR BINGLEYThey all paint tables, and embroider
          cushions and play the piano. I never
          heard of a young lady, but people say she
          is accomplished.DARCYThe word is indeed applied too liberally.
          I cannot boast of knowing more than half
          a dozen women, in all my acquaintance,
          that are truely accomplished.• CAROLINE BINGLEYNor I, to be sure!ELIZABETHGoodness! You must comprehend a great
          deal in the idea.DARCYI do.CAROLINE BINGLEYAbsolutely. She must have a thorough
          knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
          dancing and the modern languages, to
          deserve the word. And something in her
          air and manner of walking.DARCYAnd of course she must improve her mind
          by extensive reading.
          Elizabeth closes her book.ELIZABETHi am no longer surprised at your knowing
          only six accomplished women. I rather
          wonder now at your knowing any.�DARCYAre you so severe on your own sex?22.ELIZABETH• I never saw such a woman. She would
          certainly be a fearsome thing to behold.
          Pause. Darcy goes back to his letter. Caroline Bingley
          picks up a book. Pauses. Puts it down. she walks over toLIZZIE_CAROLINE BINGLEYMiss Bennet, let us take a turn about the
          room.
          Lizzie, surprised, gets up. Caroline Bingley links her
          arm and they start walking up and down.CAROLINE BINGLEY (CONT'D)It's refreshing, is it not, after sitting
          so long in one attitude?ELIZABETHAnd it's a small kind of accomplishment,
          I suppose.
          Darcy meets Lizzie's eye, briefly. He goes back to his
          letter-writing. More walking up and down. Caroline
          Bingley turns to Darcy.CAROLINE BINGLEYMr Darcy, will you join us?DARCY(shakes his head)
          You can only have two motives, Miss
          Bingley, and I would interfere with
          either.CAROLINE BINGLEY(to Lizzie, archly)
          What can he mean?ELIZABETHOur surest way of disappointing him will
          be to ask nothing about it.CAROLINE BINGLEY(TO DARCY)Please tell us!DARCYEither you are in each other's confidence
          and have secret affairs to discuss, or
          you are conscious that your figures
          appear to the greatest advantage by
          walking. If the first, I should get in
          your way. If the second, I can admire you
          • much better from here.23.• CAROLINE BINGLEYOh, shocking! How shall we punish him for
          such a speech?ELIZABETHWe could always tease him.CAROLINE BINGLEYOh no, Mr Darcy is not to be laughed at!ELIZABETHAre you too proud, Mr Darcy? And would
          you consider that a fault?DARCYThat I couldn't say.ELIZABETHFor we're trying to find a fault in you.DARCYMaybe it's that I find it hard to forgive
          the follies and vices of others, or their
          offences against myself. My good opinion,
          once lost, is lost forever.ELIZABETH• Oh dear, I cannot tease you about that.
          What a shame, for I dearly love to laugh.CAROLINE BINGLEY(SMALL SMILE)A family trait I think.
          Elizabeth smiles, sweetly. Miss Bingley glances at Darcy.25 TNT. BEDROOM -- NETHERFIELD - MORNING. 25Elizabeth wakes up next to Jane.26 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY. 26Darcy gallops through the countryside.27 EXT. STABLE YARD - NETHERFIELD - DAY. 27Darcy, exhausted, rides into the stable yard. In the
          corner is a trough and pump. He strides up to the pump,
          puts his head under it and douses himself with cold
          water.024.• 28 INT/EXT. BEDROOM/STABLE YARD -- NETHERFIELD - THE SAME. 21From a window Elizabeth looks out at Darcy.
          Darcy looks up and for a second catches Elizabeth looking
          down at him. She turns from the window. Jane is waking
          up.ELIZABETHJane, do you think you might feel well
          enough to leave today?29 INT. DRAWING ROOM - NETHERFIELD - DAY. 29The doors open. The Butler as before:BUTLERA Mrs Bennet, a Miss Bennet, a Miss
          Bennet and a Miss Bennet, sir.CAROLINE BINGLEYAre we to receive every Bennet in the
          country?
          Mrs Bennet, Lydia, Mary and Kitty are introduced to
          Caroline, Bingley and Darcy. Elizabeth holds her breath
          as her mother launches into untold gaucheries.MRS BENNETWhat an excellent room you have sir. Such
          expensive furnishings. I hope you intend
          to stay here, Mr Bingley.BINGLEYAbsolutely I find the country very
          diverting. Don't you agree, Darcy?DARCYI find it perfectly adequate even if
          society is a little less varied than in
          town.MRS BENNETBut I assure you there is quite as much
          going on in the country as there is in
          the town.ELIZABETHIndeed Mania, I think Mr Darcy merely
          meant there were not such a variety of
          people to be met in the country as there
          are in town, which you must acknowledge
          to be true.�25.• MRS BENNETNonsense, we dine with four and twenty
          families. Sir William Lucas for instance
          is a very agreeable man. So very genteel
          and easy.
          Elizabeth cringes.LYDIAMr Bingley, is it true that you have
          promised to hold a ball here at
          Netherfield?BINGLEYWell...LYDIAIt would be an excellent way to meet new
          friends. You could invite the militia.KITTYOh do hold a ball.ELIZABETH(trying to stop Bingley beingBAMBOOZLED)Kitty...BINGLEYWhen your sister has recovered you shall
          name the day.MARYI think a Ball is a perfectly irrational
          way to gain new acquaintance. It would be
          better if conversation instead of dancing
          were the order of the day.CAROLINE BINGLEYIndeed much more rational but rather less
          like a ball.ELIZABETHThank you, Mary.BINGLEY(to Mrs Bennet)
          Please let me show you to Jane, you will
          find her quite recovered.CUT TO:026.30 EXT. DRIVE -- NETHERFIELD - DAY.The Bennet's carriage awaits. The Bingley's are gathered
          to see the Bennet's off. Jane is radiant - in the peak of
          health.JANE(to the Bingley's)
          Really, I don't know how to thank you.
          Bingley beams bashfully. He can't take his eyes off her.BINGLEYReally, you're welcome anytime you feel
          the least bit poorly.ELIZABETH(TO CAROLINE)Thank you for such stimulating company.
          It has been most instructive.CAROLINE BINGLEYNot at all. The pleasure is all mine.
          Elizabeth looks at Darcy, who does not say anything. She
          gets in the carriage.ELIZABETHMr Darcy.DARCYMiss Bennet.
          They share a look as Elizabeth joins the rest of the
          Bennets in the carriage. The driver takes off. Bingley
          waves enthusiastically to Jane.BINGLEYGoodbye. Goodbye.31 INT. CARRIAGE - LEAVING NETHERFIELD - THE SAME. 31The family are all squeezed in rather too tightly.MRS BENNETWhat a high and mighty man that Mr Darcy
          is, quite eaten up with pride.32 EXT. MERYTON - DAY. 3The Bennet's carriage is stopped in its tracks by the
          Militia who are marching en masse through town.27.• 33 INT. CARRIAGE - MERYTON - DAY. 33Lydia cannot believe her eyes as row after row of
          soldiers pass by the carriage with not a few of the men
          looking in at the Bennet girls with some interest.LYDIAI can't believe it, there must be a
          thousand of them.
          Leading the one troupe of Militia is Wickham a very
          handsome blonde officer, Lydia spots him and swoons.ELIZABETH(to the coachman)
          Please, drive on.34 INT. LONGBOURN - HERTFORDSHIRE - DAY. 34As the Bennet girls come into the house, Lydia eulogizing
          the Militia, they meet Mr Bennet.MR BENNETI hope, my dear, that you have ordered a
          good dinner today, because I have reason
          to expect an addition to our family�party.
          Mr Bennet holds up the letter.35 INT. CARRIAGE - COMING THROUGH MERYTON - DAY. 35Collins, late twenties, an overweening sychophant,
          nervous and unctuous in equal measure. He sits in his
          black garb, hunched uncomfortably as he comes through
          town.COLLINS (V.O.)"Dear sir, the disagreement subsisting
          between yourself and my late father over
          the entail to me of the Longbourn estate,
          has long been a subject of much torment
          which I have frequently wished to heal.
          Having received ordination this Easter
          and being so fortunately distinguished by
          the patronage of the Right Honorable Lady
          Catherine de Bourgh..."
          Collins' voice fades out as his carriage wipes through
          frame revealing Elizabeth and Charlotte on their way to
          the butchers.028.LIZZIE• His name is Mr Collins. He's the dreaded
          cousin.CHARLOTTEWho's to inherit?LIZZIEIndeed. Everything, apparently. He may
          leave us our stays, but even my piano
          stool belongs to Mr Collins.CHARLOTTEWhen?LIZZIEHe can turn us out of the house as soon
          as he pleases.CHARLOTTEBut why?LIZZIEBecause the estate is entailed to him and
          not to us poor females.
          A cart passes, crammed with sheep going to slaughter.36 INT. HALLWAY - LONGBOURN -- DAY. 36Mr Collins is ushered in by the manservant, Perkins. He
          looks around his future home with interest.
          Mr and Mrs Bennet greet him.MR COLLINS(DEEP BOW )Mr Collins, at your service.(LOOKS AROUND)What a charming house! So convenient for
          the local village.
          (looks at the furniture)
          And some very fine pieces, if I'm not
          mistaken.

          Jane, Lizzie and Mary enter.MR COLLINSAh, these are your daughters, are they
          not?29.MR BENNETWe have some more somewhere.MR COLLINSI must congratulate you. I have heard
          much of their beauty, but in this
          instance fame has fallen short of the
          truth.
          A very low bow. The girls are somewhat taken aback.37 INT. DINING ROOM -- NETHERFIELD - EVENING. 37The Bennets and Collins are seated formally for supper.
          Mr Collins is served some food.COLLINSWhat a superbly featured room and what
          excellent boiled potatoes. It is many
          years since I had such an exemplary
          vegetable. To which of my fair cousins
          should I compliment the excellence of the
          cooking?MRS BENNETMr Collins, we are perfectly able to keep
          a cook.�COLLINSExcellent. I am very pleased the estate
          affords such a living. I am honoured to
          have, as my patroness, Lady Catherine de

          Mrs Bennet shakes her head.MR COLLINSMy small rectory abuts her estate,
          Rosings Park, and she often condescends
          to drive by my humble abode in her little
          phaeton and ponies.
          A pause. Lizzie catches her father's eye.MRS BENNETDoes she have any family?MR COLLINSOne daughter, the heiress of Rosings and
          very extensive property. I have often
          observed to Lady Catherine, that her
          daughter seemed born to be a duchess for
          she has all the superior graces of
          • elevated rank.(LITTLE COUGH)(MORE)30.MR COLLINS (cont'd)

          compliments that are always acceptable to
          1�1 ladies, and which I conceive myself
          particularly bound to pay.MR BENNET(GRAVELY)How happy for you, Mr Collins, to possess
          the talent for flattering with delicacy.
          Mr Collins nods with satisfaction.ELIZABETHDo these pleasing attentions proceed from
          the impulse of the moment or are they the
          result of previous study?
          Jane kicks Elizabeth under the table. Elizabeth tries not
          to laugh at Mr Collins' answer.MR COLLINSThey arise chiefly from what is passing
          at the time, and though I sometimes amuse
          myself with arranging such little elegant
          compliments, I always wish to give them
          as unstudied an air as possible.ELIZABETHBelieve me, no one would suspect your
          manners to be practised.
          The girls look at one another.COLLINSAfter dinner I thought I might read to
          you all an hour or two. I have with me

          on this point.(TO JANE)Do you know Fordyce's sermons Miss
          Bennet?38 INT. CORRIDOR -- LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 38Later; we can see the girls and Mr Bennet gathered by the
          fire through the doorway. Mr Collins leaves the room and
          takes Mrs Bennet aside to a very discrete conference, out
          of hearing of anyone else.COLLINSMrs Bennet. You do know I have been

          through the house and out the front.
          Mr Collins doubles back and follows them into the house.

          is broken by Lydia coming up.LYDIALizzie, please lend me some money!ELIZABETH�You already owe me a considerable sum,
          Liddy.MR WICKHAMAllow me to oblige.ELIZABETHNo! Please - Mr Wickham! -
          Wickham gives Elizabeth a smile and moves away to the
          counter.42 EXT. MILLINER'S SHOP - DAY. 42The girls emerge from the shop with Wickham.ELIZABETHYou're too generous.WICKHAMI know. Fivepence halfpenny!ELIZABETHIt all adds up.� LYDIAI'll pay him back.34.WICKHAMOh yes. I'll make sure of that.�They laugh. Elizabeth is really rather taken with him.
          They walk down the street.ELIZABETHWill you be stationed here all winter, Mr
          Wickham?WICKHAMThat depends on what the French have in
          mind. Of course I look forward to
          action...
          (smiles at her)
          But on the other handJANELizzie - look!
          They stop. Jane's face lights up.JANEMr Bingley !
          It is indeed Bingley, riding towards them. He is
          accompanied by Darcy.
          • Bingley jumps off his horse and hurries over to Jane. His
          open, friendly face is filled with delight.BINGLEYI was on my way to your house.LYDIA -Please Mr Bingley, when are you going to
          give a ball?JANELydia!BINGLEYI was just waiting until your sister was
          quite well.-LYDIAShe is!
          Elizabeth pays no attention to the following
          conversation, instead she is looking at Darcy who, in
          turn, is staring at Wickham. They both obviously
          recognize each other and look very uncomfortable.KITTY- when, then?35.MR BINGLEY�As soon as they have made the white soup.LYDIABe sure to invite Mr Wickham.
          Darcy turns and rides off without a word.JANELydia, you can't just say that -MR BINGLEYWill you excuse me ladies? Mr Wickham.
          Enjoy the day.
          Elizabeth looks at Wickham, puzzled.43 INT. DRAWING ROOM - THE LUCAS' HOUSE - DAY. 43A small cards party is underway. Three tables have been
          set up. Elizabeth, Wickham, Jane, Lydia, Kitty, Charlotte
          and Sir William and Lady Lucas are present. A small
          number of officers and other ladies are also present. We
          move around the tables. Kitty is sat with Sir William and
          Charlotte and Mary. Jane sits at a table with Mr Collins
          and Lady Lucas. Lizzie sits with Lydia and two other
          officers. Lydia flirts outrageously.�LYDIA.We have asked mama if we might have new
          dresses for the Netherfield ball.KITTYYes, white, they must be white.LYDIAWhite is the only colour to be worn this
          season.SIR WILLIAMSo I believe.
          Mr Collins is at a table with Lady Lucas, he glances over
          at Elizabeth, as he talks.COLLINS- of course, when you understand that
          Lady Catherine de Bourgh is its
          proprietor you will realise what an
          immense compliment that is. Lady
          Catherine spent eight hundred pounds on a
          chimney-piece alone.
          • Wickham who has been talking to some of the other
          officers comes and sits beside Elizabeth, passing by Mr
          collins on the way.36.WICKHAM(aside to Elizabeth)
          Your cousin is blessed with an uncommon
          capacity for charm.
          Elizabeth laughs and plays a hand.LYDIAWill you be attending the Netherfield
          ball, Mr Wickham?WICKHAMI hope to.(TO ELIZABETH)How long has Mr Darcy been a guest a
          Netherfield?
          Elizabeth pounces on this reference to Mr Darcy and takes
          her chance.ELIZABETHAbout a month. Are you acquainted with,
          Mr Darcy?WICKHAMIndeed, my fate has been very intimate
          with that gentleman. I have been
          connected with his family since infancy.
          Elizabeth is genuinely surprised, there is a pause while
          she is forced to play her hand.WICKHAM (CONT'D)You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet,
          especially given the cold manner of our
          intimacy this afternoon. Are you well
          acquainted with that gentleman?ELIZABETHAs much as I could ever wish to be. I
          have spent four days in the same house as
          him, and I think him very disagreeable.WICKHAMI cannot pretend to be sorry.
          Elizabeth blushes.WICKHAMBut really I speak out of turn.
          Collins voice breaks the moment.COLLINSMiss Elizabeth, I was just saying to Sir
          William what appalling weather we've been
          having.37.Elizabeth cannot believe her misfortune in Mr Collins,
          • but she smiles politely.ELIZABETHI think I shall take a little air.
          She rises and walks through the room towards a balcony.
          As she passes the other tables we follow and witness
          snippets of their conversations.CHARLOTTE(TO MARY)It seems Mr Wickham has met with
          universal approval. Though Lizzie looks
          singularly pleased with him.MARYAt the moment she has more suitors than
          sense.
          Charlotte looks over at Mr Collins. Elizabeth passes Sir
          William's side of the table.SIR WILLIAMNow any one for a round of bridge?
          Elizabeth?ELIZABETH�Really I need to take some air.
          Mr Collins makes his way to join Elizabeth.SIR WILLIAMMr Collins?COLLINSOh, I am not so familiar with the game,
          Sir William.SIR WILLIAMAbsolute nonsense. I insist that you join
          us.CHARLOTTEPlease, Mr Collins, I'd be happy if you'dPARTNER ME_Collins resigns himself to his fate. Elizabeth smiles and
          slips out into the night air.44 EXT. BALCONY - THE LUCASES HOUSE - MERYTON - NIGHT. 44Elizabeth breathes in the cold night air. She senses
          someone join her. She looks round to see Wickham has
          followed her as she had hoped.38.ELIZABETH• I hope your plans in favor of Meryton
          will not be affected by your difficult
          relations with the gentleman we were just
          speaking of.WICKHAMOh no - it is not for me to be driven
          away. If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he
          must go not I.
          Pause.ELIZABETHI must ask you Mr Wickham, what is the
          manner of your disapproval of Mr Darcy?WICKHAMDo you really want to hear?
          Lizzie nods.WICKHAMHe ruined me.
          She stares at him.ELIZABETHHow so?WICKHAMMy father managed his estate. We grew up
          together, Darcy and I. His father treated
          me like a second son. Oh he was the
          kindest of men and bequeathed me the best
          living in his gift, for I had my heart
          set on joining the church. But when he
          died Darcy ignored his wishes and gave
          the living to another man.LIZZIEWhy did he do that?WICKHAMOut of jealousy, for his father loved me
          more than he loved him.LIZZIEHow cruel! Are you sure?WICKHAM(NODS)And out of pride, for he considered me
          too lowly to be worth his consideration.�Pause. Lizzie gazes at him with horror and sympathy.39.• 45 INT. BEDROOMS - LONGBOURNE - THE SAME. 45We pan through the bedrooms as the Bennet girls prepare
          for the Netherfield ball. Kitty is helping Lydia into her
          dress, they are both wearing white.LYDIAAggghh!KITTYBreathe in!
          We move to the quieter preparations of Jane and
          Elizabeth. This conversation has been going on for some
          time.JANE(HORRIFIED)- I still think there must have been a
          misunderstanding.LIZZIE(EXASPERATED LAUGH)Oh Jane, do you never think ill of
          anybody?JANE0 How could Mr Darcy do such a thing? I
          will discover the truth from Mr Bingley
          at the ball this evening.ELIZABETHIf it is not true let Mr Darcy contradict
          it himself. But until he does, I hope
          never to encounter him.JANEPoor, unfortunate Mr Wickham.ELIZABETHOn the contrary, he is twice the man
          Darcy is.JANEAnd lets hope for you a rather more
          willing dancer.
          Jane leaves Elizabeth, at the mirror, taking very
          particular care of her makeup. she smil6s to herself.46 INT. NETHERFIELD - HERTFORDSHIRE - NIGHT. 46• The great doors of Netherfield open to reveal the ball in
          full swing. Compared to the somewhat clod-hopping
          Assembly, its a dazzling affair.40.There are hundreds of guests. All the women, roughly two
          hundred, are dressed in white. The men are either in red
          • officer uniform or dressed in black and white. There are
          a number of rooms each occupied by a different activity,
          cards, buffet, women's closet. The final and grandest
          room is the ball room, a swirl of elegant dance.
          The Bennet's enter the first reception room, the girls,
          including Mrs Bennet, are all dressed in white. Mr
          Collins is slightly detained as people pass. Mr Bingley
          bounds up to Jane.BINGLEYYou're here! I'm so pleased.JANEAnd so am I.BINGLEYHow are you, Miss Elizabeth?
          Elizabeth is not paying attention, instead she is
          searching over Mr Bingleys' shoulder for a sight of
          Wickham.BINGLEYAre you, looking for someone?ELIZABETH• No, no not at all. Admiring the splendor
          of the ball.JANEIt is lovely, Mr Bingley.
          Bingley and Jane move off leaving Elizabeth with Mrs
          Bennet and others. While Mrs Bennet talks we focus on
          Elizabeth searching the sea of red coats.MRS BENNET(refering to Jane andBINGLEY)I dare say I have never met a more
          pleasant gentleman in all my years. Look
          how he dotes on her! Still Jane has
          always done what is best for her family.
          Elizabeth takes this opportunity to slip away into the
          next room. Elizabeth looks around but cannot see Mr
          Wickham. Suddenly she thinks she sees him, so starts to
           a r, move over. The man turns round, it is not Wickham but
           someone else.
           Elizabeth walks nonchanantly into the next room, again
           looking for Mr Wickham. She cranes around trying to see
          • him then she is suddenly surprised by Charlotte Lucas.41.ELIZABETH�Have you seen Mr Wickham.
          She shakes her head.CHARLOTTEPerhaps he is in the ballroom.
          They both walk into the ball room. We pull back to reveal
          a sea of dancers. Wickham is nowhere to be seen. Jane
          appears and catches Elizabeths arm.JANEHe's not here. Apparently otherwise
          detained.
          The disappointment is palpable on Elizabeth's face.ELIZABETHDetained?
          Mr Collins arrives, breathless. He smiles eagerly at
          Elizabeth.COLLINSThere you are.� ELIZABETHMr Collins. What a pleasant surprise.MR COLLINSPerhaps you will do me the honour, Miss
          Elizabeth?ELIZABETHOh. I didn't think you danced, Mr
          Collins.MR COLLINSI do not consider it incompatible with
          the office of a clergyman to indulge in
          such an innocent diversion.
          Elizabeth tries to smile, politely.MR COLLINS (CONT'D)In fact several people, her ladyship
           included, have complimented me on my
           lightness of foot.
           Elizabeth's face is a matey rictus.CUT TO:• They dance, the style of which is not unlike English
          Country dancing.42.COLLINS• To be sure, dancing is of little
          consequence to me, but it does afford the
          opportunity to lavish'ones partner with
          delicate attentions which is my primary
          object of the evening.
          Elizabeth turns as part of the dance and for a moment she
          dances beside Jane.JANEApparently Your Mr Wickham has been
          called on some business to town, though
          my informer told me he would have been
          less inclined to be engaged had it not
          been for the presence at Netherfield of a
          certain gentleman.
          Jane indicates towards where Darcy stands watching them.ELIZABETHThat gentleman barely warrants the name.
          The dance leads Elizabeth back to Mr Collins.COLLINS (CONT`D)It is my intention, if I may be so bold
          to remain close to you throughout the
          evening.CUT TO:Couples are preparing for the next dance. Elizabeth and
          Charlotte are standing to one side when Mr Darcy
          approaches.DARCYMay I have the next dance, Miss
          Elizabeth.
          Elizabeth is stunned.ELIZABETHYou may.
          Darcy walks away.ELIZABETHWhat was I thinking? Have I no presence
          of mind?lCHARLOTTEI dare say you will find him very
          agreeable, Lizzie.043.� ELIZABETHHeaven forbid! That would be the greatest
          misfortune of all - to find a man
          agreeable whom one is determined to hate!CUT TO:Elizabeth dances face to face with Darcy. Neither can
          speak. They dance for a moment in silence.ELIZABETHI do love a Sarabande.DARCYIndeed. Most invigorating.
          They continue, for a moment, in silence.ELIZABETHIt is your turn to say something, Mr
          Darcy - I talked about the dance, now you
          ought to remark on the size of the room
          or the number of couples.DARCYI am perfectly happy to oblige, please
          advise me of what you would like most to
          • hear.ELIZABETHThat reply will do for the present.
          Perhaps by and bye I may observe that
          private balls are much pleasanter than
          public ones. But for now we may be
          silent.DARCYDo you talk as a rule while dancing?ELIZABETHWe are each of an unsocial, taciturn
          disposition, unwilling to speak, unless
          we expect to say something that will -
          amaze the whole room, and be handed down
          to posterity with all the eclat of a
          proverb. So a little lubrication to avoid
          embarrassment might be advantageous.DARCYI see no striking resemblance of your own
          character in this, how near it is to mine
          I cannot say. (beat) Tell me do you and
          your sisters very often walk to Meryton?�They are suddenly parted by the choreography of the
          dance.44.We stay with Elizabeth who is whisked round the floor by
          an elderly man who smiles at her toothlessly, Elizabeth
          • looks back at Darcy who is dancing with Lydia. He stare
          at Elizabeth as he dances. Elizabeth smiles at her
          current partner in embarrassment.ELIZABETHVery mild weather we've been having.DANCING PARTNER(deaf as a post)
          Sorry.
          The dance spins again and she is back with Darcy.ELIZABETHYes, we often walk to Meryton - it is a
          great opportunity to meet new people. In
          fact when you met us we had just had the
          pleasure of forming a new acquaintance.DARCYI will admit your Mr Wickham is blessed
          with such happy manners as may ensure his
          making friends - whether he is capable of
          retaining them is less certain.ELIZABETHHe has been so unlucky as to lose your
          friendship. I remember hearing you once
          say that your resentment once created was
          unappeasable. You are very cautious, I
          suppose, as to its being created?DARCYI am. May I ask to what these questions
          tend.ELIZABETHTo make out your character, Mr Darcy.DARCYAnd what have you discovered?ELIZABETHvery little.
          The dancefinishes.ELIZABETH (CONT'D)I hear such different accounts of you as
          puzzle me exceedingly.DARCYI hope to afford you more clarity in the
          • future.45.• They bow to each other and Elizabeth moves quickly away
          from Darcy.CUT TO:Elizabeth is at the buffet watching Kitty quaff a huge
          glass of wine and having the glass immediately refilled.
          She is joined by Caroline Bingley who also looks at Kitty
          disapprovingly.CAROLINE BINGLEYMiss Elizabeth. Let me recommend you as a
          friend not to give too much confidence to
          all of the assertions your friend Mr
          Wickham might make. He is indeed a
          charming man, but one should never forget
          from where he is descended.ELIZABETHHis lack of trustworthiness and descent
          appear by your account to be the same
          thing,CAROLINE BINGLEYPlease excuse my interterence, it was
          kindly meant.
          • A breathless Mr Collins appears.COLLINSIs that Mr Darcy, of Pemberley in
          Derbyshire?ELIZABETHI believe so.COLLINSBut I must make myself known to him
          immediately!ELIZABETHBut sir -COLLINSHe is the nephew of my esteemed
          patroness, Lady Catherine.ELIZABETH(SURPRISED)He is?
          Mr Collins starts making his way determinedly towards
          Darcy.� ELIZABETHPlease, Mr Collins! He'll consider it anIMPERTINENCE --46.Elizabeth watches from a distance, with acute
          embarrassment, as Collins interrupts Darcy. Darcy does
          not notice him so Collins raises his voice.COLLINS (CONT'D)Mr Darcy!
          The room around him stops. Darcy is surprised and turns
          round. In dumbshow we see Darcy is horrified by Collins'
          obsequiousness, during the conversation Collins points
          Elizabeth out to Darcy.CAROLINE BINGLEYWhat interesting relatives you have, Miss
          Bennet.
          Elizabeth walks away into another room.CUT TO:The other room, where Mary is singing badly at the piano.
          Elizabeth is horrified. She turns to leave only to see Mr
          Bennet looking on. He winces as Mary misses a high note.
          Mary finishes the song with an off key flourish. Polite
          applause. Mary smiles and prepares for another song.ELIZABETHAren't you going to do something?�Mr Bennet walks over to the piano.MR BENNETMary dear, you've delighted us long
          enough.MARYBut they asked for another song.
          Mr Bennet shuts the lid.MR BENNETLet the other young ladies have a turn.CUT TO:Later. Charlotte and Lizzie are sat together.ELIZABETHPerhaps my family have made a competition
          to see who can expose themselves to the
          most ridicule.CHARLOTTEWell, at least Bingley has not noticed.�They look over and see Jane and Bingley dancing. Bingley
          clearly besotted by Jane.47.ELIZABETH• Yes. I think he likes her very much.CHARLOTTEBut does she like him? There are few of
          us who are secure enough to be really in
          love without proper encouragement.
          Bingley likes her enormously but might
          not do more if she does not help him on.ELIZABETHShe is just shy and modest. If he does
          not perceive her regard he is a fool.CHARLOTTEWe are all fools in love. He does not
          know her character as we do. She should
          move fast. Snap him up. There is plenty
          of time for us to get to know them after
          we're married -
          Elizabeth looks over the dancefloor to see Lydia dancing
          with a soldier. she's a little drunk, and very
          flirtatious. He says something; she shrieks with
          laughter.CUT TO;47 MONTAGE OF THE BALL 47Elizabeth sits at the side of the dance-floor. She looks
          at Mrs Bennet dancing in outrageous fashion. Cut to
          later: Lydia is getting more and more leery with a group
          of soldiers, Elizabeth walks away in embarrasment only to
          see Mr Collins smiling at her from across the room. Cut
          to: Elizabeth dancing joylessly with the excruciating Mr
          Collins, as she turns in the dance she sees Darcy look on
          with obvious disdain. Cut to: much later, the band are
          exhausted, guests are leaving. The staff are asleep on
          their feet. Elizabeth almost alone watching her parents
          dancing almost the only people left on the dance floor,
          Kitty is asleep over Elizabeth's lap. This is a never-
          ending nightmare.48 INT. ENTRANCE HALL-- NETHERFIELD - THE WEE HOURS 48Day light creeps through the curtains. Mrs Bennet is
          sprawled on a sofa. Lydia completely drunk. Kitty asleep.
          Jane sitting demurely. Collins looking longingly at
          Elizabeth. Mrs Bennet is holding court, whilst the
          footmen behind are literally ready to drop. Bingley is
          standing, the perfect host, but obviously willing the
          • Bennets to leave.48.MRS BENNETI have never had such a good time in my
          life. Mr Bingley you must have such a
          ball once a month at least.
          Caroline who is standing with her brother, yawns
          ostentatiously.ELIZABETHMother. I really think it is time to go.MRS BENNETDon't be impertinent. our hosts are
          perfectly happy with our company, are you
          not, Mr Bingley? I hope I can entice you
          to Longbourn to sample our hospitality.
          We would make sure you had 3 or 4 courses
          at least.
          She holds out her glass for a top up and carries on.MRS BENNET (CONT'D)So tell me Mr Bingley. Whom did you like
          least of all your guests this evening?ELIZABETHReally. This is enough.
          Darcy looking down at Elizabeth from a staircase. He
          turns and walks away.49 INT. CARRIAGE - HERTFORDSHIRE - MORNING. 49The Bennet's are squeezed into their carriage. It is
          light outside. Only Mrs Bennet is awake but the lack of
          an audience does not stop her from talking.MRS BENNETAllowing for new carriages, dresses
          etcetera, etcetera. We will be having a

          she is hungover. Mr Collins comes in in a state of
          agitation. They look at him. He sits, hesitates, thenASKS:049.is MR COLLINS
          Mrs Bennet I was hoping, if it would
          not trouble you, that I might solicit a
          private audience with Miss Elizabeth in
          the course of the morning.
          Elizabeth is open mouthed.MRS BENNETOh! Yes. Certainly - Lizzy would be very
          happy indeed. Please -- go ahead. No time
          like the present. Everyone. Out. Mr
          Collins would like a private audience
          with your sister.
          Everyone looks in amazement.ELIZABETHWait. I beg you. Mr Collins can have
          nothing to say to me.that anybody need
          not hear.MRS BENNETNo. Nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you-will
          stay where you are. Everyone else, to the
          drawing room. Mr Bennet.• MR BENNETBut...MRS BENNETNow!
          Mrs Bennet makes sure everyone leaves, winks at Mr
          Collins then shuts the door before Elizabeth has time to
          do anything. Elizabeth looks at Mr Collins who looks at
          her in earnest. There is a horrible pause of intense
          embarrassment.MR COLLINSDear Miss Elizabeth, you can hardly doubt
          the purpose of my discourse. My
          attentions have been too marked to be
          mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the
          house I singled you out as the companion
          of my future life.
          Elizabeth stares at him, astonished.MR COLLINSBut before I am run away with my feelings
          perhaps I may state my reasons for
          marrying. Firstly, that it is the duty of
          a clergyman to set the example of
          matrimony in his parish.(MORE)S0.MR COLLINS (cont'd)
          Secondly, that I am convinced it will add
          greatly to my happiness, and, thirdly,
          • that it is at the urging of my esteemed
          patroness Lady Catherine that I select a
          wife.
          We here a kick and Kitty screach from behind the door.MRS BENNET (V.0.)sshhh.MR COLLINSMy object in coming to Longbourn was to
          choose such a one from amongst Mr
          Bennet's daughters, for as you know I am
          next in the entail of the estate and such
          an alliance will surely make amends for
          this.
          (drops to his knee)
          And now nothing remains for me but to
          assure you in the most animated language
          of the violence of my affections.ELIZABETHMr Collins -MR COLLINSAnd that no reproach on the subject of
          fortune will cross my lips once we are
          • married.ELIZABETHYou are too hasty, sir! You forget that I
          have made no answer.MR COLLINS(UNPERTURBED)I must add, that Lady Catherine will
          thoroughly approve, when I speak to her
          of your modesty, economy and other
          amiable qualities.ELIZABETHSir, I am honoured by your proposal, but
          regret I must decline it.MR COLLINS(momentarily taken aback, butRECOVERING)I know ladies have their pretty little
          ways, and don't seek to seem too eager -ELIZABETH(in some desperation)
          Mr Collins, I am perfectly serious. You
          could not make me happy and I'm convinced
          I'm the last woman in the world who could
          make you happy.51.• MR COLLINS(PAUSE)I 'flatter myself, cousin, that your
          refusal is merely a natural delicacy.
          Besides, you should take into account
          that despite your manifold attractions it
          is by no means certain that another offer
          of marriage may ever be made to you -ELIZABETH(rising, deeply affronted)
          Mr Collins -MR COLLINSSo I must conclude that you simply seek
          to increase my love by suspense,
          according to the usual practice of
          elegant females.ELIZABETHSir! I am not the sort of female to
          torment a respectable man. Please
          understand me - I cannot accept you!
          Elizabeth storms out of the room and out of the house.
          Mrs Bennet crashes in through another door, hot on the
          tail of Elizabeth.�MRS BENNETDeclined indeed! The headstrong, foolishCHILD-COLLINSThank you, but... Head strong?MRS BENNET- we shall have this little hiccup dealt
          with immediately, Mr Collins.
          Mrs Bennet goes chases after Elizabeth. Mr Collins
          watches through a window as Elizabeth is chased by her
          mother.51 INT. LIBRARY - LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 51Mrs Bennet marches into the library. Mr Bennet looks up
          in shock.MRS BENNETOh Mr Bennet. We are all in a uproar. You
          must come and make Lizzy marry Mr
          Collins, for she vows she will not have
          him.�Mr Bennet starter at Mrs Bennet blankley.52.MRS BENNETMr Collins, Mr Collins has proposed to
          Lizzie. But Lizzy declares she will not
          have him, and now the danger is Mr
          Collins may not have Lizzy.MR BENNETAnd what am I to do?
          Mrs Bennet drags Mr Bennet to his feet.MRS BENNETSpeak to Lizzy.
          They march to find Elizabeth.52 INT. HALLWAY - LONGBOURN -- THE SAME. 52Mr Bennet and Mrs Bennet confront Elizabeth, who has been
          waiting in the hallway. Perhaps the other girls form an
          audience from the stairs, Mr Collins looks on sheepishly
          from the breakfast room.MRS BENNETTell her that you insist upon them
          marrying.� LIZZIEPapa, please - '.MRS BENNETYou will have this house!LIZZIEI can't marry him!MRS BENNETYou'll save your sisters from
          destitution!LIZZIEI can't! -MRS BENNETGo back now and say you've changed your
          mind!LIZZIENo!0MRS BENNETThink of your family!LIZZIEYou can't make me!53.MRS BENNETMr Bennet, say something!MR BENNET(TO LIZZIE)So, your mother insists on you marrying
          Mr Collins.-MRS BENNETYes, or I shall never see her again?MR BENNETWell, Lizzie. From this day on you must
          be a stranger to one of your parents -MRS BENNET(TO LIZZIE)- who will maintain you when your father
          is dead?MR BENNETYour mother will never see you again if
          you do not marry Mr Collins, and I will
          never see you again if you do.MRS BENNETMR BENNET'ELIZABETHThank you, papa.
          Elizabeth turns around and walks into the drawing room.53 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - THE SAME 53Elizabeth enters the drawing room. In the drawing room,
          Mary is trying to read, through the family din. Jane sits
          very still. Her face is white. There's a letter in her
          hand. Mrs Bennet charges in, Lydia and Kitty in tow, and
          speaks to anyone who will listen.MRS BENNETOh, ungrateful child! I shall never speak
          to her again! Not that I have much
          pleasure in talking to anybody. People
          who suffer as I do from nervous
          complaints can have no inclination for
          talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer...
          She jabbers on but her voice fades. We're with Jane, re-
          reading the letter.ELIZABETHWhat's wrong, Jane?
          Close on Jane's pale face. She's staring at the letter.54.MRS BENNET(DISTANT)But it is always so. Those who complain
          are never pitied...54 EXT. NETHERFIELD - DAY. 54Bingley, Caroline and Darcy sit grimly in a carriage
          which drives off.55 INT. CARRIAGE -- LEAVING NETHERFIELD - THE SAME. 55Darcy looks severe and stern, Caroline can't help a
          little smirk on her face. Bingley looks back longingly.56 INT. BEDROOM -- LONGBOURNE - NIGHT. 56Elizabeth and Jane in bed.ELIZABETHI don't understand. What would take him
          from Netherfield? Why would he not know
          when he was to return?JANE• I have no reserves from you.
          Jane passes Elizabeth the letter.ELIZABETH"Mr Darcy is impatient to see his sister
          and we are scarcely less eager to meet
          her again. I really do not think Georgina
          Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance
          and accomplishments, so much so I must
          hope to hereafter call her my sister. It
          is my duty to indulge you in no hope in
          this respect for your own self."JANEIs that not clear enough?ELIZABETHMiss Bingley sees that her brother is in
          love with you and is gone with him to
          persuade him otherwise.JANEBut I know her to be incapable of
          wilfully deceiving anyone.ELIZABETH• He loves you, Jane. Do not give up. Go to
          our aunt and uncle's in London.(MORE)55.ELIZABETH (CONT'D)Let it be known you are there and I am
          sure he will come to you.�57 EXT. LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 57Jane is in a carriage. Mrs Bennet kisses her goodbye
          through the window as all the Bennets look on.MRS BENNETGive my love to my sister. And try not to
          be so much of a burden, dear.
          Jane's carriage moves away and the family wave. Mr Bennet
          talks to Elizabeth.MR BENNETPoor Jane. However, a girl likes to be
          crossed in love now and then. It gives
          her something to think of, and a sort of
          distinction among her companions.ELIZABETH(DRYLY)I'm sure that will cheer her up,Papa.MR BENNETIt's your turn now, Lizzie. Since you've
          turned down Mr Collins you're free to go
          off and be jilted yourself. What about Mr
          Wickham? He is a pleasant fellow and
          would do the job credibly.ELIZABETHThank you, but a less agreeable man would
          satisfy me. We must not all expect Jane's
          good fortune.MR KENNETStill, it's a comfort to know that
          whatever might befall you, you have an
          affectionate mother who will be sure to
          make the most of it.
          A small smile from Elizabeth.58 INT. BEDROOM - LONGBOURN - DAY 58Elizabeth is making the bed and tidying Jane's
          belongings. There is a knock at the door and Charlotte
          enters.CHARLOTTEMy dear Elizabeth, I've come here to tell
          you the news.56.ELIZABETH• What news?CHARLOTTE(DEFIANTLY)Mr Collins and I are engaged to be
          married.
          A stunned pause.ELIZABETHEngaged?CHARLOTTE(TIMIDLY)You don't mind, do you?ELIZABETHNo, no...
          (tries to recover)
          Of course not.CHARLOTTEHe asked for my hand this morning .and
          I accepted him.
          Elizabeth looks quite faint. Charlotte sits on the bed.
          Elizabeth, after a pause, sits down beside her.CHARLOTTEI can see you're surprised - coming so
          soon after his wishing to marry you...ELIZABETH(WEAKLY)No...CHARLOTTEI'm not a romantic, you know. I ask only
          a comfortable home, and considering Mr
          Collin's character, and situation in
          life, I am convinced that my chance of
          happiness with him is as fair as most
          people can hope for.ELIZABETHAnd that's all you expect?CHARLOTTEFor women in our situation, what choice
          is there?ELIZABETH(PASSIONATELY)Don't speak like that, Charlotte!57.CHARLOTTE• - to become an old maid, at best
          tolerated, at worst a burden, dependent
          on the kindness of others? Or to seek the
          protection of marriage.ELIZABETHAnd we only have two choices?CHARLOTTEYes.
          An appalled silence. Elizabeth gazes at her closest
          friend. Charlotte has recovered herself. she now looks
          cool and composed - unnervingly so.ELIZABETHYou can still change your mind,
          Charlotte.CHARLOTTE(shakes her head)
          I'm twenty-seven years old.
          We hear the sound of the militia drums...59 EXT. MERYTON - DAY. 590The militia are leaving Meryton. Hundreds of soldiers and
          officers in the red coats marching out of the village to
          the sound of pipes and drums. The villagers are out to
          bid them farewell. Lydia and Kitty run through the crowds
          very distraught. They find Elizabeth coming in the other
          direction.LYDIAIt's too dreadful! They're leaving for
          Brighton.ELIZABETHAll of them?KITTYThey got the call this morning.LYDIANot a word of warning!
          Lydia wails. Elizabeth searches the red coats for
          Wickham. She spots him, he glances across at her, she
          gives a pathetic wave and he's gone. Lydia and Kitty
          chase the last of the officers, leaving Elizabeth alone.
          She walks into the post office.�58.C 60 INT. VILLAGE POST OFFICE - THE SAME. 6The Postmaster hands a letter to Elizabeth. Elizabeth
          opens it and reads it.POSTMASTERBad news, Miss?ELIZABETHIt could not be worse. I have been
          invited to possibly the very last place
          on earth I would like to go.61 EXT. MERYTON - DAY. 61Elizabeth comes out of the post office to reveal...
          Time has passed, the now deserted village is covered in a
          thick blanket of snow. A lonely Elizabeth walks away
          totally despondent.62 EXT. HUNSFORD PARSONAGE - KENT - DAY. 6<Charlotte's new home is a smallish but charming rectory
          in Kent. Charlotte greets Elizabeth, kissing her warmly.
          • Mr Collins bows as he ushers her in.MR COLLINSWelcome to our humble abode...63 EXT. HUNSFORD PARSONAGE- DAY. 63There is a coop containing hens of various
          descriptions ...a.pig-stye...a vegetable patch...a rose
          bower. Charlotte and Mr Collins are showing Elizabeth
          round the place.MR COLLINS(POINTING)And from here we have a good view of
          Rosings Park, where we are honoured to
          dine at least twice a week. Her
          ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered
          for us. I should say, one of her
          ladyship's carriages, for she has
          several.CHARLOTTEMy dear, I think our guest is tired after
          her journey. Come on, Lizzie, let's get
          some tea.T59.MR COLLINS• My wife encourages me to spend as much
          time in the garden as possible, for the
          sake of my health.
          A beat. Lizzie glances at Charlotte, who remains
          impassive.MR COLLINSI plan many improvements, of course.
          (points to house)
          I intend. to throw out a bow there, and
          plant a lime walk.
          (sharp look at Lizzie)
          Oh yes, I flatter myself that any young
          lady would be happy to be the mistress of
          such a house.
          A tiny nod from Elizabeth. She understands perfectly.64 INT. CHARLOTTE'S PARLOUR - HUNSFORD - DAY. 64Lizzie and Charlotte are at last alone. They sit down,
          with a certain relief, in a charming little parlour that
          faces the front of the house. Charlotte pours out tea.CHARLOTTE• We shall not be disturbed here, for this
          parlour is for my own particular use.(A BEAT)Oh Lizzie, it's such a pleasure, to run
          my own home!
          A flash of understanding between them.MR COLLINS (OOV)Charlotte! Come here!
          Charlotte jumps up and rushes to the window.ELIZABETH(ALARMED)What's happened?MR COLLINS (OOV)Charlotte!ELIZABETH(JUMPS UP)Has the pig escaped?
          Lizzie joins her at the window. outside in the lane, Mr
          Collins stands, bowing, at a carriage.�CHARLOTTEIts all right. Its just Lady Catherine.60.They both burst out laughing. Just for a moment, the
          • atmosphere is eased.CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)Tell me, how are things concerning Mr
          Wickham?
          Elizabeth's face changes.ELIZABETHI have not heard from Mr Wickham since
          the regiment left for Brighton, but I am
          informed by Lydia who keeps a breast of
          all matters military that he does very
          well.CHARLOTTEOh Lizzie.
           we hear Mr Collins rushing back into the house, and
           running up the stairs.COLLINS (O.S.)Great news! Great news!
           He comes into the room, breathlessly excited.COLLINS (CONT'D)• We have an invitation to visit Rosings
          this evening from Lady Catherine de
          Bourgh.
          Elizabeth is not overcome with enthusiasm.COLLINS (CONT'D)Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear
          cousin, about your apparel. Just put on
          that which is best among your clothes and
          Lady Catherine will not think the worse
          of you.65 EXT. GROUNDS OF ROSINGS - EVENING. 65Elizabeth, Charlotte and Mr Collins walk hurriedly across
          the lawns towards the great house. Beyond the toparied
          hedges the grey building looms ominously above them. It
          is grand without being elegant.COLLINSOne of the most extraordinary sights in
          all Europe, is it not. The glazing alone
          cost upwards of twenty thousand pounds.061.�66 INT. STAIRWAY -- ROSINGS - THE SAME. 66Mr Collins, Charlotte and Elizabeth are led up a vast
          stairway which is painted with visions of hell. Elizabeth
          stops in front of a painting of a devil. She stares at
          it, It seem to speak, but she realizes the voice is
          Collins chiding her.COLLINS(as the devil)
          This way!67 TNT. SALON - ROSINGS - DUSK. 67The salon at Rosings is spectacularly grand; hideously
          so. Heavy furniture, rows of servants. The three guests
          are shown in by the footman. Again Mr Collins scrapes
          the floor with his bow.MR COLLINSYour Ladyship.
          (to the daughter)
          Miss de Bourg.
          Lady Catherine is a haughty, bossy woman. Pretty
          • unspeakable, really. Her daughter is a sickly, irritable-
          looking creature.LADY CATHERINESo you are Elizabeth Bennet.ELIZABETHI am, your ladyship.LADY CATHERINE(looking her up and down)
          Hmm.
          (indicates her daughter)
          This is my daughter.CHARLOTTE(EAGERLY)It's very kind of you to ask us to dine,
          Lady Catherine.
          Lady Catherine ignores her.MR COLLINS(whispers to Lizzie)
          The chimneypiece alone cost £400.
          But Lizzie doesn't hear. Darcy walks into the room.
          Lizzie freezes. When he sees Lizzie he, too, falters, and
          recovers himself. Another man (Fitzwilliam) is with him.62.ELIZABETH• Mr Darcy! What are you doing here?MR COLLINSMr Darcy!
          (another deep bow)
          I had no idea we would have the honour...
          A stiff bow from Darcy, who looks at Mr Collins as if
          he's something brought in by the dog. He turns to Lizzie,
          trying to collect himself.DARCY(BOWS)Miss Bennet...I'm staying here.LADY CATHERINE(SURPRISED)You know my nephew?ELIZABETHYes, madam, I had the pleasure of meeting
          him in Hertfordshire.
          Darcy's friend Fitzwilliam, a much more easy-going chap,
          introduces himself.FITZWILLIAM• Colonel Fitzwilliam. How do you do?
          He bows. Lizzie returns his smile gratefully. They move
          towards the dining room. Mr Collins leans towards
          Lizzie.MR COLLINS(WHISPERING)You know Mr Darcy is as good as engaged
          to Miss de Bourg?ELIZABETHReally? Miss Bingley will be disappointed
          to hear that.
          (looks at the girl, and
          whispers to charlotte)
          What a sickly, cross little thing! Oh
          yes, they should suit each other very
          well.
          Charlotte smiles back, a little fearfully. She's more
          intimidated by Rosings than Elizabeth is, and indeed has
          more at stake.
           68 INT. DINING ROOM - ROSINGS - NIGHT. f
          9 The dining room is laid for a very grand dinner -- footmen
          waiting, thousands of candles.63.Lady Catherine seats herself at the head of the table.
          The guests wait for their orders.�LADY CATHERINEYou sit there and you sit there. Mr
          Collins! You can't sit next to your wife!
          After some awkward shuffling around they all sit down.
          Lizzie, much to her discomfort, finds herself sitting
          next to Darcy. There is a pause.MR DARCYI trust your family is in good health,
          Miss Bennet?ELIZABETHThey are, thank you.(PAUSE)My eldest sister is currently in London,
          perhaps you happened to see her there?MR DARCY(AWKWARD PAUSE)I haven't been fortunate enough, no.
          Lizzie looks at him. He colours slightly. Lady Catherine
          addresses Lizzie in a loud voice, from the head of the
          table.�LADY CATHERINEDo you play the pianoforte, Miss Bennet?ELIZABETHA little, ma'am, and very poorly.LADY CATHERINEOh. Do you draw?ELIZABETHNo, not at all.LADY CATHERINEYour sisters, do they draw?ELIZABETHNot one.LADY CATHERINEThat is very strange. But I suppose you
          had no opportunity. Your mother should
          have taken you to town every spring for
          the benefit of the masters.ELIZABETHMy mother would have no objection but my
          father hates London.64.LADY CATHERINE• Has your governess left you?ELIZABETHWe never had a governess.
          Mr Collins squirms in embarrassment. Darcy watches
          Elizabeth, keenly.LADY CATHERINENo governess? Five daughters brought up
          at home without a governess, I never
          heard such a thing! Your mother must have
          been quite a slave to your education.ELIZABETH(can't help smiling at this)
          Not at all, Lady Catherine.LADY CATHERINEMmmm. Are any of your younger sisters
          out?ELIZABETHYes, ma'am. All.LADY CATHERINEAll! What, five out at once? Very odd!
          • And you only the second - the younger
          ones out before the elders are married!
          Your youngest sisters must be very young.ELIZABETHYes, my youngest is not sixteen. But I
          think it would be very hard on younger
          sisters, not to have their share of
          amusement because the elder is still
          unmarried. And to be kept back on such a
          motive! It would hardly encourage
          sisterly affection.LADY CATHERINEUpon my word, you give your opinion very
          decidedly for so young a person. Pray,
          what is your age?ELIZABETH(SMILES)With three younger sisters grown up, your
          Ladyship can hardly expect me to own toP Cit.
          Lady Catherine looks astonished. Mr Collins shifts in
          his seat. Mr Darcy glances sharply - in fact, admiringly
          - at Lizzie. She's enjoying herself.65.69 INT. DRAWING ROOM - ROSINGS -- NIGHT. 69Dinner is over and they are drinking coffee. Darcy moves
          towards Elizabeth but Lady Catherine interrupts, by
          shouting from her seat.LADY CATHERINECome, Miss Bennet, and play for us!ELIZABETHNo, I beg you -LADY CATHERINEFor music is my delight. In fact there
          are few people in England who have more
          true enjoyment of music than myself, or
          better natural taste. If I had ever
          learnt, I should have been a great
          proficient.(INDICATES DAUGHTER)So would Anne, if her health would have
          allowed her.ELIZABETHPlease, I told you I play poorly -• MR COLLINS(HISSES)Come come, Elizabeth, her ladyship
          demands it!
          Lizzie reluctantly sits down at the piano and starts to
          play. Lady Catherine takes no notice and talks loudly
          over the music.LADY CATHERINEHow does Georgina get along, Darcy?DARCYShe plays very well.LADY CATHERINEI hope she practises. No excellence can
          be acquired without constant practice. I
          have told Mrs Collins this.

          Though you have no instrument of your own
          you are very welcome to come to Rosings
          and play on the piano in the

          in that part of the house.
          Darcy flinches at her bad manners. He moves away to the
          piano where Lizzie is playing - not that terribly well,
          it must be said. A moment passes.ELIZABETHYou mean to frighten me, Mr Darcy, by
          coming in all your state to hear me, but
          I won't be alarmed even though your
          sister does play so well.DARCYI am well enough acquainted with you,
          Miss Bennet, to know I cannot alarm you
          even should I wish it.
          A beat. They eye each other warily. Colonel Fitzwilliam
          joins them.FITZWILLIAM(INDICATING DARCY)What was my friend like, in
          Hertfordshire?ELIZABETH• You really care to know?
          The colonel nods.ELIZABETHPrepare yourself for something very
          dreadful.(STOPS PLAYING)The first time I saw him, at the
          Assembly, he danced with nobody at all -
          even though gentlemen were scarce and
          there was more than one young lady who
          was sitting down without a partner.DARCY(COLOURING )I knew nobody beyond my own party.ELIZABETH(SMILES SWEETLY)True, and nobody can be introduced in a
          ballroom.LADY CATHERINEFitzwilliam! Come here and talk to us!
          0 Fitzwilliam moves away. Darcy and Elizabeth are alone.67.DARCYI do not have the talent of conversing
          easily with people I have never met
          before.ELIZABETHMaybe you should take your aunt's advice
          and practice.
          Ouch! Darcy flinches. Lizzie turns away from him and
          carries on playing. Darcy gazes at the curve of her neck.
          She plays a false note, stumbles, and grimly carries on.70 INT. DRAWING ROOM - HUNSFORD - DAY. 70Elizabeth is writing a letter in the drawing room. She
          starts "Dear Jane..:" The doorbell rings in the
          background, she thinks nothing of it and continues. The
          maid opens the door to the drawing room and Mr Darcy
          enters.ELIZABETH(ASTONISHED)Mr Darcy!
          An awkward pause.ELIZABETHPlease, do be seated.(PAUSE)I'm afraid Mr and Mrs Collins are gone on
          business to the village.
          A pause. What on earth does Mr Darcy want? He paces up
          and down.DARCYThis is a charming house. I believe my
          aunt did a great deal to it when Mr
          Collins first arrived.ELIZABETHI believe so -- and she could not have
          bestowed her kindness on a more gratefulSUBJECT-Another pause.DARCYMr Collins seems very fortunate in his
          choice of wife.�68.ELIZABETHHe is indeed lucky to have found one of
          the few sensible women who would have
          accepted him.
          Darcy sits down.ELIZABETHShall I call for some tea?DARCYNo. Thankyou.
          The sound of the front door, and voices. Darcy jumps up.DARCYGood day, Miss Bennet. It's been a
          pleasure.
          He bows to her and leaves. Elizabeth sits there, bemused
          and intrigued.CUT TO:Charlotte, in the hallway, taking off her bonnet. Darcy
          hurries past her, with a swift bow, and leaves abruptly.
          Charlotte gazes after him in surprise.

          Elizabeth sitting, bemused.CHARLOTTEWhat on earth have you done to poor Mr
          Darcy?ELIZABETH.I have no idea.
          73 She truly doesn't. Charlotte gives Elizabeth a look 7371 EXT. HUNSFORD CHURCH - DAY. 71Sunday service is over and worshippers are leaving the "
          church. Mr Collins, in his vestments, obeises himself to
          Lady Catherine, who is sweeping out with her miserable-
          looking daughter and downtrodden governess. Elizabeth
          joins Colonel Fitzwilliam. They walk down the path
          together.ELIZABETHHow long do you plan to stay in Kent,
          Colonel?FITZWILLIAMAs long as Darcy chooses. I am at his
          disposal.69.ELIZABETHI do imagine your cousin brought you down
          with him chiefly to have someone to order
          around. I wonder he does not marry and
          secure a lasting convenience of that
          kind.FITZWILLIAMShe would be a lucky woman.ELIZABETHReally?FITZWILLIAMDarcy is a most loyal companion. From
          what I heard, on our journey here, he
          recently came to the rescue of one of his
          friends just in time.
          Darcy, waylaid by various people, comes out of the
          church. His eyes search for Elizabeth. He sees her with
          Fitzwilliam and hesitates. Too late! Mr Collins steps up
          to him and engages him in conversation. Elizabeth stops,
          at the churchyard gate.ELIZABETHWhat happened?�FITZWILLIAMHe saved the man from an imprudent
          marriage.ELIZABETH(FALTERING SLIGHTLY)Who was the man?FITZWILLIAMHis closest friend. Mr Bingley.
          A silence.ELIZABETHDid Mr Darcy give you his reasons for
          this interference?FITZWILLIAMThere were apparently strong objections
          to the lady.ELIZABETHWhat kind of objections? Her lack of
          fortune?FITZWILLIAMI think it was her family that was
          considered unsuitable.70.ELIZABETHSo he separated them?FITZWILLIAMI believe so. I know nothing else.
          Elizabeth grows pale. She turns to look at Darcy who is
          joined by his aunt.ELIZABETHI wish Mr Darcy and all his friends well
          in finding partners suitable to their
          very high standards. Good morning, Col.
          Fitzwilliam.
          76 Elizabeth see that Collinses are still busy with their 76
          parishioners and slips away. Darcy sees her from a
          distance.72 EXT. ROSINGS PARK - DAY. 72Lizzie walks across the park - anywhere, she hardly
          cares. She is in a turmoil of misery and fury. How could
          Darcy do such a terrible thing! It starts to rain.CUT TO:• A Grecian summer house by the lake. The rain is now
          bucketing down. Lizzie hurries into the summer house and
          sits down, heavily, on a bench.
          Her poor sister; Lizzie gazes in despair at the rain-
          lashed landscape.
          A man approaches, across the park. He draws nearer.
          It's Darcy. Elizabeth stiffens. He's hurrying towards
          her. Sodden, breathless, he comes into the. summer house.
          He is in a state of agitation - far too agitated to
          notice her upset face.DARCYMiss Bennet, I have struggled in vain but
          I can bear it no longer ... . The past
          months have been a torment...
          He pauses, unable to speak. Elizabeth stares at him in
          astonishment. He struggles on.DARCYI came to Rosings with the single object
          of seeing you...I had to see you...ELIZABETH• Me?71.DARCY• I've fought against my better judgement,
          my family's expectation...(PAUSE)The inferiority of your birth.. .my rank
          and circumstance...(STUMBLINGLY)all those things.. .but I'm willing to put
          them aside... and ask you to end my
          agony...ELIZABETHI don't understand...DARCY(WITH PASSION)I love you. Most ardently.
          Elizabeth stares at him.DARCYPlease do me the honour of accepting my
          hand.
          A silence. Elizabeth struggles with the most painful
          confusion of feeling. Finally she recovers.ELIZABETH(VOICE SHAKING)Sir, I appreciate the struggle you have
          been through, and I am very sorry to have
          caused you pain. Believe me, it was
          unconsciously done.
          A silence. Gathering her shawl, she gets to her feet.DARCY(STARES)Is this your reply?ELIZABETHYes, sir.DARCYAre you laughing at me?ELIZABETHNo?DARCYAre you rejecting me?ELIZABETH(PAUSE)I'm sure that the feelings which, as
          you've told me, have hindered your
          regard, will help you in overcoming it.72.A terrible silence, as this sinks in. Neither of them can
          • move. At last, Darcy speaks. He is very pale.DARCYMight I ask why, with so little endeavour
          at civility, I am thus repulsed?ELIZABETH(trembling with emotion)
          I might as well enquire why, with so.
          evident a design of insulting me, you
          chose to tell me that you liked me
          against your better judgement. If I was
          uncivil, that was some excuse -DARCYBelieve me, I didn't mean -ELIZABETHBut I have other reasons, you know I
          have!DARCYWhat reasons?ELIZABETHDo you think that anything might tempt me
          to accept the man who has ruined, perhaps
          for ever, the happiness of a most beloved
          sister?
          Silence. Darcy looks as if he's been struck across the
          face.ELIZABETHDo you deny it, Mr Darcy? That you
          separated a young couple who loved each
          other, exposing your friend to the
          censure of the world for caprice, and my
          sister to its derision for disappointed
          hopes, and involving them both in misery
          of the acutest kind?DARCYI do not deny it.ELIZABETH(BLURTS OUT)How could you do it?DARCYBecause I believed your sister
          indifferent to him.ELIZABETH• Indifferent?73.DARCY• I watched them most carefully, and
          realized his attachment was much deeper
          than hers.ELIZABETHThat's because she's shy!DARCYBingley too is modest, and was persuaded
          that she didn't feel strongly for him.ELIZABETHBecause you suggested it!DARCYI did it for his own good.ELIZABETHMy sister hardly shows her true feelings
          to me!
          (pause, takes a breath)
          I suppose you suspect that his fortune
          had some bearing on the matter?DARCY(SHARPLY)No! I wouldn't do your sister the�dishonour. Though it was suggested -(STOPS)ELIZABETHWhat was?DARCYIt was made perfectly clear that-an
          advantageous marriage...(STOPS)ELIZABETHDid my sister give that impression?DARCY -No!
          An awkward pause.DARCYThere was, however, I have to admit...
          the matter of your family -ELIZABETHOur want of connection? Mr Bingley didn't
          vex himself about that!�DARCYNo, it was more than that.74.ELIZABETHHow, sir?DARCY(pause, very uncomfortable)
          It pains me to say this, but it was the
          lack of propriety shown by your mother,
          your three younger sisters - even, on
          occasion, your father. Forgive me.
          Lizzie blushes. He has hit home. Darcy paces up and down.DARCYYou and your sister -- I must exclude from
          this...
          Darcy stops and gazes at her. He is in turmoil. Elizabeth
          glares at him, in a blaze of fury and misery.ELIZABETHAnd what about Mr Wickham?DARCYMr Wickham?ELIZABETHWhat excuse can you give for your
          behavior to him?�DARCYYou take an eager interest in that
          gentleman's concerns!ELIZABETHHe told me of his misfortunes.DARCYOh yes, his misfortunes have been very
          great indeed!ELIZABETHYou have ruined his chances, and yet
          treat him with sarcasm?DARCYSo this is your opinion of me! Thank you
          for explaining so fully. Perhaps these
          offences might have been overlooked, if
          your pride had not been hurt -ELIZABETHMy pride?DARCY- by my honesty in admitting scruples
          about our relationship.(MORE)75.DARCY (CONT'D)Could you expect me to rejoice in the
           inferiority of your circumstances?�ELIZABETHAnd those are the words of a gentleman?
          From the first moment I met you, your
          arrogance and conceit, your selfish
          distain of the feelings of others, made
          me realize that you were the last man in
          the world I could ever be prevailed upon
          to marry.
          Darcy recoils, as if slapped. A terrible silence.DARCYForgive me, madam, for taking up so much
          of your time.
          He leaves, abruptly.
          Elizabeth watches him stride away, through the rain. What
          has she done? She bitterly bursts into tears.73 INT. HUNSFORD - DAY. 73Elizabeth comes in soaked to the skin. Charlotte runs to

          the table. It is Fordyce's Sermons. She puts it down and
          walks to the mirror and stares at herself. After a moment
          suddenly Darcy's face appears. She freezes. They stare at
          each other without speaking. Finally...DARCYI came to leave you this.
          He places a letter on the table behind her. Elizabeth
          does not turn but watches him through the mirror.DARCY (CONT'D)I'm not going to renew the sentiments
          which were so disgusting to you, but to
          address the two offenses you have laid
          against me. I had not long been in
          Hertfordshire before I saw that Bingley�preferred your eldest sister. I observed
          my friend's behaviour attentively and I
          could perceive that his partiality for
          Miss Bennet was beyond what I have ever
          witnessed in him.
          Elizabeth cannot bring herself to look at Darcy. She
          stares at her own reflection as he speaks.DARCY (CONT'D)Yet when I observed your sister .1
          detected no symptom of peculiar regard,
          and witnessed only the families coarse
          appetite for having their daughters
          married favorably. And so in London,
          perhaps erroneously, I persuaded him of
          the unfitness of the match citing your
          sisters coolness towards him.
          We zoom in on Elizabeth's reflection.DARCY (CONT'D)It was unknowingly done and though the
          motives which governed me may to you
          appear naturally insufficient, they were
          done to protect a friend. As to the other

          voice carries.DARCY (V.0.) (CONT'D)"My father provided for Mr Wickham a
          valuable living.

          reads the letter, as Darcy's voice carries on.DARCY (V.0.) (CONT'D)"But upon his death, however, Mr Wickham
          told me that he had no intention of

          town and study the law.

          doubts about his character. These were

          everything.81 INT. THE GARDINERS' HOUSE - DAY. 81Elizabeth has found a quiet corner with her father.ELIZABETHPlease Papa, don't let her go!MR BENNETLydia will never be easy till she has
          exposed herself in some public place or
          other, and we can never expect her to do
          it with so little inconvenience as under
          the present circumstances.ELIZABETH(with great emotion)
          If you, dear father, will not take the
          trouble to check her, she will be fixed
          forever as the silliest and most
          determined flirt who ever made her family
          ridiculous. And Kitty will follow, as she
          always does.MR KENNETWe shall have no peace until she goes.ELIZABETH(really angry now)
          Peace! Is that all you care about?MR BENNETColonel Forster is a sensible man and
          will keep her out of any real mischief,
          and she is far too poor to be an object
          of prey to anyone.81.ELIZABETHFather, its dangerous! -MR BENNETI'm sure the officers will find women
          better worth their while. Let us hope, in
          fact, that her stay in Brighton will
          teach her her own insignificance. At any
          rate she can hardly grow any worse,
          without authorizing us to lock her up for
          the rest of her life.
          Elizabeth gazes at her father - will nothing touch him?
          He gave up on his daughter long ago. For this, just now,
          she hates him.ELIZABETHNo wonder our family is treated with
          contempt.
          She leaves, tears stinging her eyes. Her father looks
          puzzled at her outburst.82 INT. DRAWING ROOM - CHEAPSIDE - THE SAME. 82Mr Bennet follows Elizabeth in.MR BENNETWell, at least the house will be quieter.ELIZABETHI don't wish to be stuck with such a
          foolish family any longer, with your
          constant talk of men and marriages.
          Surely there is more to life.MRS GARDINERLizzie dear, you would be very welcome to
          accompany us?MR GARDINEROh yes. We plan to journey through the
          Peak District. You'd be most welcome.MARYOh, the glories of nature! What are men,
          compared to rocks and mountains?ELIZABETHBelieve me, men are either eaten up with
          arrogance or stupidity. And if they're
          amiable they're so easily led that they
          have no minds of their own whatsoever.82.MRS GARDINERTake care, my love, that savours strongly
          of bitterness.ELIZABETHNo, they bring nothing but heartache.83 INT. BEDROOM - CHEAPSIDE - NIGHT. 83As usual Elizabeth and Jane share a bed. They lie next to
          each other in the darknessELIZABETHI saw Mr Darcy when I was in Rosings.JANEWhy did you not tell me. Did he mention
          Mr Bingley.
          Pause.ELIZABETHNo. He did not.
          Elizabeth has never felt more alone in the company of her
          sister.�84 EXT. DERBYSHIRE - DAY. 84A ravishing landscape of savage and romantic beauty -
          scudding clouds, mountains, wild rocky outcrops.
          Elizabeth is walking freely, the wind in her hair. As she
          nears the peak of a promontory, Mr and Mrs Gardiner are
          below making their way towards her. They smile at her.
          She strides off determined to reach the very top. When
          she gets there she stands with her arms outstretched, her
          head back laughing into the wind. The view is
          magnificent. She breathes deeply.85 EXT. LAMBTON - DUSK. 85An establishing shot of Lambton, a charming market town.
          Through the window of an inn we see Elizabeth and Mr and
          Mrs Gardiner at a table.86 INT. INN - LAMBTON - NIGHT. 86OIn the inn, the Gardiner's and Elizabeth are eating
          supper. An air of high spirits. At the next table,
          another amiable tourist couple are also tucking into
          their food.�83.WOMAN• (indicating her husband)
          He's been taking the waters at Buxton.(LAUGHS)Hasn't done him a jot of good.HER HUSBANDBut we've had a fine time, haven't we
          dear?WOMANWe've visited Chatsworth, Dovedale,PEMBERLEY -MRS GARDINERPemberley?WOMANJust two miles from here.
          close, very close, on Lizzie's face.HER HUSBANDOne of the best houses in the country.MR GARDINER(TO ELIZABETH)Aren't you acquainted with the owner, Mr
          • Darcy?MRS GARDINERWell, we shall go there tomorrow, Lizzie.ELIZABETHI would rather stay here.MRS GARDINERStay here?ELIZABETH(VERY UNCOMFORTABLE)I must own that I'm tired of great
          houses. All those carpets and curtains.MRS GARDINERBut you liked Chatsworth.ELIZABETHIf it is anything like Mr Darcy, I am
          sure I will not be able to bear it.MRS GARDINERCome, come, Lizzie.WOMAN�The grounds alone are worth a visit.84.MR GARDINERLet us not make a fuss. If the girl does
          not want to go there is little point in
          persuading her.87 INT. BEDROOM -- INN - NIGHT. 87Elizabeth is preparing for bed. The chambermaid fills her
          washbowl and starts to leave.ELIZABETHI hear that Pemberley is not far from
          here.MAIDYes, madam.ELIZABETHYou see something of the owner, do you,
          in town?MAIDNot for some months, madam, for he's
          still in London, I believe.
          A pause. Close on Elizabeth's face.�88 EXT. PEMBERLEY - DAY. 8n
          The carriage enters the gates of Pemberley.MRS GARDINERI'm so glad you changed your mind.
          Elizabeth is alert, her eyes bright with curiosity. The
          parkland is wild and rocky. Deer graze; rooks wheel in
          the sky. A sense of freedom and liberation. As the
          carriage drives over the top of a hill, close on
          Elizabeth's face. She gasps. The Gardiners gasp.
          A huge, wide shot of Pemberley House. It's vast,
          breathtakingly beautiful, set in great boulder-strewn
          park lands. A mansion built of golden stone, glowing in
          the sunlight.89 EXT. PARK - PEMBERLY - THE SAME. 89Elizabeth walks through the magnificent grounds.MRS GARDINERImagine being mistress of all this. It is
          as big as all Cheapside.
          Elizabeth is lost in admiration.85.90 INT. PEMBERLY - DAY. 90Elizabeth and the Gardiners are being taken on the tour
          by the housekeeper, Mrs Reynolds, who witters on in the
          background with descriptions of each room. Elizabeth is
          apart and we witness the exquisite house from her point
          of view. A book lies open, on a reading desk, Elizabeth
          turns it over to read the title.MRS GARDINER(TO ELIZABETH)Keep up.
          They walk through room after amazing room: a breath-
          taking library, an unbelievable staircase.91 INT. PICTURE GALLERY - PEMBERLY -- DAY. 91The huge picture gallery. Elizabeth is apart from the
          rest looking at the pictures she stops by a painting of
          Darcy. She looks at it thoughtfully but is interrupted by
          Mrs Reynolds and the Gardiners who are following her.MRS REYNOLDSThis is my master - Mr Darcy.MRS GARDINERA handsome face. Lizzie, is it a true
          likeness of him?MRS REYNOLDSDoes this young lady know Mr Darcy?ELIZABETHOnly a little.MRS REYNOLDSAnd do you not think him a handsome man,
          Miss?ELISABETH(THOUGHTFULLY)Yes, yes I suppose he is.
          Mrs Reynolds moves the Gardiners on to another painting,
          but Elizabeth stays, staring at Darcy's image.MRS REYNOLDSAnd this is his sister, Miss Georgians.
          She plays and sings all day long.
          We realize that in the distance we have heard music.
          Elizabeth is still gazing at the portrait of Darcy, then
          suddenly snaps out of her reverie, as she processes MrsREYNOLDS SPEECH:86.ELIZABETH• They are at home?!MRS REYNOLDSMiss Darcy is always down for the summer.
          Mr Darcy is due here tomorrow.MR GARDINERIs your master much at Pemberley?MRS REYNOLDSNot as much as I would wish, sir, or he --
          for he dearly loves it here.
          Relaxed again Elizabeth wanders off as the Gardiners talk
          to Mrs Reynolds.MRS GARDINERIf he should marry, you might see more of
          him.MRS REYNOLDSYes madam, but I do not know when that
          will be. I do not know a lady who is good
          enough for him.MRS GARDINERWhat do you mean?�MRS REYNOLDSI've known Mr Darcy since he was a boy.
          He was always a kind and generous person
          even then. Not everyone can see it,
          because he does not make a meal of it
          like a lot of young men nowadays. But he
          is the most sweet-tempered and kind-
          hearted man I have ever known.CUT TO:As the Gardiners look at more paintings, Elizabeth drifts
          out through the open doors and onto a terrace. In the
          bright sunlight the view of the gardens and valley beyond
          is exquisite. Outside the music we heard before is
          louder.92 EXT. TERRACE - PEMBERLY - THE SAME. 92Elizabeth wanders aimlessly across the terrace, being
          unconsciously drawn by the music. Suddenly Elizabeth
          recognizes the tune (perhaps it is one she has played
          earlier - but this time it is played exquisitely). She
          follows the music round a corner, intrigued as she gets
          • closer and closer to its source. She finally realizes she
          is outside the room where the music is being played.87.She steals herself a moment, but her curiosity gets the
          better of her and she discretely peeps in.�Through the window she sees Georgina Darcy, a beautiful
          fifteen year old playing the piano with great passion and
          fluency. She is moved by the music and listens. After
          sometime, then someone steps into her view but is mostly
          hidden by shadows in the room. He is directly behind
          Georgina and gently puts his hands over her eyes.
          Georgina stops playing and laughs uproariougly. She
          stands and kisses the figure, the sunlight hits his face.
          It is Darcy.
          Georgina and Darcy kiss. Elizabeth is stunned to see him
          there. Darcy glances up and sees Elizabeth watching him.
          For a moment they both stare at each other frozen with
          surprise. Georgina starts in fright at the figure,
          Elizabeth turns and runs. Darcy comes out after her.DARCYMiss Bennet!
          Elizabeth stops, appallingly embarrassed. Darcy catches
          up with her. They both blush, deeply.ELIZABETHI thought you were in London.DARCY(STUPIDLY)No... I'm not.ELIZABETHNo.
          Another ghastly silence. Then they both speak at once.DARCY ELIZABETHI came here a day early - We wouldn't have come -DARCY ELIZABETH-- some business with my I'm so terribly sorry -STEWARD -They stop. He gazes at her with great emotion.ELIZABETHI'm visiting Derbyshire with my uncle and
          aunt.DARCY(trying to recover)
          And are you having a pleasant trip?ELIZABETHVery pleasant. Tomorrow we go to Matlock.88.DARCY• Tomorrow?(DISAPPOINTED)Are you staying at Larnbton?ELIZABETHYes. At the Rose and Crown.
          Another pause. She extends her hand.ELIZABETHI'm so sorry to intrude. They said the
          house was open for visitors. I had no
          idea...
          She shakes his hand and starts to walk away.DARCYMay I see you to the village?ELIZABETHOh no! I'm very fond of walking.DARCYYes.ELIZABETHGoodbye, Mr Darcy.�She hurries away. He gazes after her.CUT TO:A wood. Now she is out of sight Lizzie collapses on a
          log. She is utterly undone. Around her, the birds sing.93 INT. INN -- NIGHT. 93It's that night. Lizzie comes downstairs, for supper. And
          stops. Through a gap in the door to the restaurant she
          sees Mr Darcy talking to her aunt and uncle.DARCY- I shall send my carriage at noon
          After a moment Darcy leaves and Elizabeth approaches the
          table.0 MRS GARDINERLizzie, I've just met Mr Darcy! Why
          didn't you tell us you had seen him? He's
          asked us to dine with him tomorrow - He
          was very civil, was he not?�MR GARDINERVery civil.89.MRS GARDINER• Not at all like you painted him.ELIZABETH(STARES)To dine with him?MRS GARDINER- there is something pleasing about his
          mouth, when he speaks.MR GARDINERYou don't mind delaying our journey for
          another day?
          Elizabeth shakes her head, dumbly.MRS GARDINERHe particularly wishes you to meet his
          sister.ELIZABETHHis sister?94 INT. LIBRARY AND DRAWING ROOM -- PEMBERLEY - DAY. 94A footman escorts Elizabeth and the Gardiner's through
          the stupendous library. From the drawing room, the sound
          of a piano playing.. It's the same music Elizabeth played
          at Rosings, but this time played very beautifully.
          Elizabeth is filled with trepidation; we can almost feel
          her heart racing.
          The footman opens the double doors to reveal the
          magnificent drawing room. Darcy is there. So is the
          dreaded Miss Bingley. Seeing her, Elizabeth's polite
          smile falters. Darcy's sister Georgiana plays the piano.
          She jumps up and hurries over.DARCYMy sister, Miss Darcy...
          They smile and bob. Georgiana is a friendly, sweet girl.GEORGIANAMiss Elizabeth, my brother has told me so
          much about you. I feel as if we are
          friends already.ELIZABETHWhat a beautiful instrument.GEORGIANAMy brother gave it to me.
          (smiles at him)
          He shouldn't have.90.DARCY• Yes I should.GEORGIANAOh very well then.DARCYShe's easily persuaded, is she not?
          They gaze at each other with affection. Miss Bingley
          approaches.MISS BINGLEY(SMALL SMILE)What a surprise, Miss Bennet, to see you
          in Derbyshire.ELIZABETH(SMALL NOD)Your brother is well, I trust?MISS BINGLEYVery well. He hopes to come here soon.
          (significant glance atGEORGIANA)Pemberley has a special attraction for
          him.� ELIZABETH(SWEETLY)Yes, the library is particularly
          splendid, is it not?
          A small silence. Darcy, uneasy at their conversation,
          approaches.MISS BINGLEYAnd how is your family, Miss Bennet?
          Someone told me the militia are removed
          from Meryton.(SIGNIFICANT SMILE)They must be a great loss for some of you
          Darcy comes to the rescue.DARCYYour uncle is fond of fishing, I hear.ELIZABETHYes, very.DARCY(drawing her away)
          Can you persuade him to borrow a rod this
          afternoon?(MORE)91.DARCY (CONT'D)For the lake here is very well stocked
          and its occupants left in peace for far
          • too long.
          Elizabeth smiles, surprised and delighted. And grateful
          to be rescued. What does Mr Darcy mean by this?
          She moves away, to speak to her uncle. Miss Bingley moves
          closer to Darcy.MISS BINGLEYIn six months I have never seen anyone so
          altered. How brown and coarse she has
          become!DARCYI perceive no alteration' except she is
          rather tanned. Hardly a miraculous
          consequence of travelling in the summer.MISS BINGLEYI remember, when we first knew her in
          Hertfordshire, you said "she a beauty? I
          would have as soon called her mother a
          wit!"DARCYYou must have mis-heard, Caroline. Even
          had I thought it, I would have couched it�with a little more finesse.
          Elizabeth looks across at Darcy - they smile at each
          other.95 EXT. DERBYSHIRE - DUSK 95Darcy is driving Elizabeth and the Gardiner's back to
          Lampton. The rugged landscape looks even more beautiful
          and dramatic in the dusk light. Elizabeth sits up with
          Darcy who holds the reins, while Mr and Mrs Gardiner sit
          comfortably in the carriage. Mr Gardiner smiles broadly
          at two large fish that lie beside him.ELIZABETHIt is so beautiful up here. I will be
          sorry to leave.
          Darcy smiles at her.ELIZABETHYou have been a most gracious host. I'm
          sure my aunt and uncle will talk of
          nothing else for days.� DARCYI have recently thought a great deal
          about how I appear and act to others.92.She smiles softly at Darcy.�ELIZABETHIt does you credit, sir.96 INT. INN -- LAMBTON - NIGHT. 96The party arrive back at the inn.MR GARDINER(quietly to Elizabeth)
          What a capital fellow.MRS GARDINERThank you so much Mr Darcy.
          Darcy is about to take his leave when a servant brings
          Elizabeth a letter.SERVANT(TO LIZZIE)For you, madam.ELIZABETH(DELIGHTED)107 Its from Jane. 10
          • she rips open the letter.97 INT. PARLOUR - INN - LAMBTON - THE SAME. 97Elizabeth is crying with the open letter in her hand.
          Darcy and Mr and Mrs Gardiner stand dumb, not quite
          knowing what to do. Elizabeth tries to speak but bursts
          into tears again. She cries for a long time.DARCYMiss Elizabeth.
          She cries on.DARCY (CONT'D)Miss Elizabeth.
          She eventually gathers herself.ELIZABETHIt is the most dreadful news. Lydia has
          run away - with Mr Wickham. They are gone
          together from Brighton to Lord knows
          where. She has no money, no connections,
          I fear she is lost forever.093.DARCY• (quietly to Elizabeth)
          This is my fault - if only I had exposed
          Wickham when I should.ELIZABETHNo, this is my fault. I might have
          prevented all of it by merely being open
          with my sisters rather than too proud
          with my knowledge.
          Mr and Mrs Gardiner look at each other perplexed.MRS GARDINERHas anything been done to recover her?ELIZABETHFather has gone to London. But I know
          very well that nothing can be done. We
          have not the smallest hope.DARCYWould to heaven that anything could be
          said or done on my part that could offer
          consolation to such distress.ELIZABETHSir, it think it is too late.�MR GARDINERI am afraid we must go at once - I will
          join Mr Bennet and find Lydia before she
          ruins the family forever.DARCYI am so very sorry. This is grave indeed.
          I will leave you. Goodbye.
          Darcy pauses at the door, looks back at Elizabeth and
          then is gone.98 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT. 98The Gardiner's carriage racing through the night.99 INT. LONGBOURN - MRS BENNET'S BEDROOM - DAY. 99Elizabeth, Jane, Mary and Kitty are gathered around Mrs
          Bennet who has taken to her bed.MRS BENNETWhy did the Foresters let her out of
          their sight? I always said they were
          unfit to have charge of her.94.MARY(SMUGLY)And now she is ruined.MRS BENNETYou are all ruined. Who will take you now
          with a fallen sister? Poor Mr Bennet will
          now have to fight the perfidious Wickham
          and then be killed...ELIZABETHHe hasn't found him yet, Mama.MRS BENNET- and The Collins' will turn us out
          before he is cold in his grave -JANEDo not be alarmed, mama. Our uncle is
          helping in the search.MRS BENNETLydia must know what this will do to my
          nerves, such flutterings and spasms all
          over me...100 EXT. LONDON - DAY. 10�Were looking directly down onto a London street. Mr
          Bennet stands still against the passing pedestrian
          traffic. He tries to address a passer by.MR BENNETExcuse me.
          They ignore him. He tries againMR BENNET (CONT'D)Excuse me, I'm looking for...
          Mr Bennet takes out a piece of paper.101 INT. MESS HALL - BARRACKS - NIGHT. 101Mr Bennet walks timidly into the mess hall. It is smoky,
          drunken, noisy, boisterous and extremely threatening. Mr
          Bennet stops at the threshold, gulps, then the whole room
          turns round to look at him and a sudden silence descends.
          Mr Bennet is terrified.MR BENNETI am...(his voice breaks up - he clears
           his throat) I am looking for a Mr
          • Wickham.95.�102 INT. UPSTAIRS AT LONGBOURNE - DAY. 102Elizabeth and Jane are outside Mrs Bennet's room. From
          inside we hear a moan.MRS BENNET (OFF)We are ruined. Ruined.ELIZABETHHow long is this going to go on for?JANEDon't be too harsh. This is hard for all
          of us.
          They walk downstairs.103 INT. DOWNSTAIRS - LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 103Elizabeth and Jane walk into the drawing room. Kitty and
          Mary are busying themselves.ELIZABETHI can't bear not hearing anything.� KITTYLook. It's Papa!104 INT. LIBRARY - LONGBOURN - DAY. CONTINUOUS. 104The girls rush into the library. Mr Bennet slumps at his
          desk.KITTY- who is to fight Wickham and make him
          marry Lydia, now you've come home?MR BENNETFor God's sake let me be!(TO LIZZIE)Lizzie, help me with my boots.
          Elizabeth pulls off his boots for him.JANEYou suppose them to be still in London?MR BENNET(NODS)Where else could they be so well
          concealed?�ELIZABETHOh father, I'm so sorry.96.MR BENNET• It's been my own doing.ELIZABETHYou mustn't be too severe on yourself.MR BENNETNo Lizzie. Let me once in my life feel
          how much I have been to blame.(WAN SMILE)I am not afraid of being overpowered by
          the experience. It will pass away soon
          enough.105 EXT/INT. BOARDING HOUSE - LONDON - DAY. 105We're looking through a window to the stairwell of a
          seedy looking boarding house. An anonymas pair of mens
          boots appear climbing up the stairs. We move across the
          exterior wall of the building to find an open window
          through which Lydia and Wickham can be seen.
          Lydia and Wickham sit, snuggled close beside the fire in
          their room in a humble lodging house. They're eating a

          A knock at the door. They freeze, like naughty children.�106 EXT. GARDEN - LONGBOURN - DAY. 106The girls have a letter. Kitty grabs it from Jane, Mary

          Jane grabs it from Mary.JANEIt's to Daddy. It's in uncle's writing.
          Mr Bennet snatches the letter.MR BENNETAs it is addressed to me...
          He tears it open and begins to read, squinting because he
          has forgotten his glasses.MR BENNET (CONT'D)He's found them.KITTYAre they married?MR BENNET(squinting at the letter)

          Wickham's condition.KITTYA hundred pounds!ELIZABETHYou will agree to this, father?
          The letter is passed around the other girls.MR BENNETOf course I will agree. But how much your
          uncle has laid on this wretched man
          already is anybody's guess.KITTYWhat do you mean, Father?�MR BENNETNo man in his senses would marry Lydia on

          The other Bennet's are assembled.ELIZABETHWe should thank our uncle, Mama.MRS BENNETAnd so he should help! He's much richer

          have her ten miles from me -MR BENNETBefore you take any of these houses, Mrs
          Bennet, let us be clear. Into one house
          she will never be welcome.
          Mrs Bennet stares at him.999.• 108 INT. HALLWAY - LONGBOURN - DAY. 108Lydia's triumphant face. The cat that's got the cream.
          She comes into the house with Wickham. Her mother kisses
          her, effusively. Mr Bennet coldly bows.LYDIA- and then we passed Sarah Sims in her
          carriage so I took off my glove and let
          my hand just rest on the window frame, so
          she might see the ring, and then 1 bowed
          and smiled like anything!
          Kitty shrieks with envy. Lizzie moves away; she cannot
          bear it. Wickham catches her eye, but she ignores him.109 INT. DINING ROOM - LONGBOURN - DAY. 109They are taking their seats for dinner. Lydia moves to
          the head of the table.LYDIAJane, I take your place now, and you must
          go lower, for I am the married woman.
          She sits down and giggles at her sisters. The maid brings
          • in the food. Lydia holds up her hand, to display her ring
          to the maid.LYDIAYou must all go to Brighton, for that is
          the place to get husbands! I hope you
          have half my good luck.ELIZABETH(FURIOUS)Lydia!CUT TO:Wickham looking uncomfortable. He's talking to the stony-

          such a fuss -ELIZABETHI don't want to hear -LYDIA- there was my aunt, preaching and
          talking away just as if she was reading a
          sermon, she was horrid unpleasant -ELIZABETHCan't you understand why?LYDIA- but I didn't hear a word because I was
          thinking of my dear Wickham. I longed to
          • know whether he would be married in his
          blue coat...CUT TO:Mary turning to Wickham.MARYThe north of England, I believe, boasts
          some spectacular scenery...CUT TO:Lydia burbling on, to a stony-faced Lizzie.LYDIA- and then my uncle was called away from
          the church on business and I thought -
          who is to be our best man if he doesn't
          come back? Lucky he did come back or I
          would have had to ask Mr Darcy -ELIZABETH(STARES)Mr Darcy?LYDIA(claps her hand to her mouth)

          Lizzie stares at her. Darcy at her wedding? Lydia turns
          away, to talk to the others.110 EXT. GARDEN - LONGBOURN - DAY. 110Lydia, croquet mallet in hand, drags her new husband
          across the lawn. Kitty follows.LYDIACome on, Wickham! You've got to play.KITTYYes, come on!
          Wickham looks slightly abashed - a trapped man. What has
          he let himself in for?
          Lizzie comes into the garden, looking for her younger
          sister. Wickham detaches himself and comes over to her. A
          rueful smile.WICKHAMI hope we can be even better friends, now
          we're brother and sister.
          An attempt at a twinkling smile, but Elizabeth is now
          immune to his charm. She nods, briefly.WICKHAMI hear you visited Pemberley. My dear old
          home.ELIZABETH(NODS)I met Mr Darcy's sister.WICKHAM(A BEAT)Did you like her?ELIZABETHVery much.
          (looks at him)
          We found a great deal to talk about.102.A beat. Wickham looks deeply uneasy. He bows and leaves.
          Lizzie watches him pick up a mallet and take his turn.
          She can't bear it; she hurries up to Lydia and draws her
          aside.ELIZABETH(LOW VOICE)Why was Mr Darcy there?LYDIAI'm not supposed to tell.
          Lizzie abandons her pride. She takes Lydia's hand.ELIZABETHPlease, Lydia!LYDIABecause he paid for it.ELIZABETH(STARES)For what?LYDIA(CARELESSLY)The wedding, Wickham's commission.
          Everything.�ELIZABETHEverything?KITTY(CALLS)Lydia! It's your turn!
          Lydia moves to go.LYDIAPeople kept saying Wickham owed them
          money, it was so tedious. So Darcy
          settled his debts but I don't really like
          him, do you?
          Lizzie pulls her back.ELIZABETHBut why did he do it?LYDIA(SHRUGS)I don't know, do I? Anyway you're not to
          tell because it's supposed to be our
          uncle who paid, and he wouldn't have
          • minded paying, either, because I'm his
          favorite.103.• She leaves. Giggles and shrieks from the croquet lawn.
          Elizabeth looks blank with shock.111 EXT. BINGLEY'S HOUSE - MAYFAIR -- DAY. 111Close on Darcy's grimly determined face. Drawing back, we
          see that he is walking down a street in Mayfair. He
          arrives at a house, pauses, and rings the bell. The door
          is opened.BUTLERMr Darcy.DARCYI have some business with Mr Bingley.
          Darcy goes inside and the door shuts. The camera cranes
          slowly upstairs until we can see through the first floor
          window and into the drawing room. Mr Darcy enters and
          bows to Mr Bingley. He starts to talk in earnest. Bingley
          looks stunned by what Darcy is relaying to him. We
          witness the dumbshow of Darcy confessing that he has
          wronged Jane Bennet.112 EXT. LONGBOURN - DAY. 112ISLydia and Wickham are leaving. Mr Bennet stands at a
          distance. Mrs Bennet sobs as Lydia climbs onto the
          carriage.MRS BENNETWrite to me often, my dear'.
          Wickham takes his leave of Elizabeth.WICKHAMPlease relay my affections to the Darcy's
          on your next acquaintance. I am sure he
          will be pleased to hear things have
          worked out so well.
          He joins Lydia.LYDIA(through the window)
          Married women never have much time for
          writing. My sisters may write to me!
          They'll have nothing else to do.
          The Mrs Bennet and the girls watch as the carriage drives
          away.0104.MRS BENNET�Oh there is nothing so bad as parting
          with ones children! One seems so forlorn
          without them.ELIZABETHThat is the consequence of marrying a
          daughter. It must make you better
          satisfied that your other four are
          single.113 EXT. MERYTON VILLAGE - DAY. 113Elizabeth and Jane are out shopping with their mother and
          sisters. Their housekeeper, Mrs Hill, comes out of the
          butchers shop.MRS HILLDid you hear the news, madam? Mr Bingley
          is returning to Netherfield.
          A stunned silence. Lizzie glances at Jane. She blushes.MRS BENNETMr Bingley?
          Mrs Hill indicates a woman in the butcher's shop.MRS HILLMrs Nichols is ordering a haunch Of pork,
          for she expects him tomorrow.MRS BENNETTomorrow?(RECOVERING)Not that I care about it. Mr Bingley is
          nothing to us and I'm sure I never want
          to see him again.(MOVES AWAY)No, we shall not mention a word about it.
          (comes back to Mrs Hill)
          Is it quite certain he is coming?MRS HILLYes, madam. I believe he is alone; his
          sister remains in town.MRS BENNETHuh! Come along, girls.
          Their mother goes into the draper's shop. Jane pauses at
          the threshold.0105.JANE�It's all right, Lizzie. I'm just glad
          that he comes alone, because then we
          shall see less of him.(BLUSHING)Not that I'm afraid of myself, but I
          dread other people's remarks.
          A brave smile. Lizzie, of course, is not convinced in the
          slightest. They go into the shop.114 EXT. LONGBOURN -- DAY. 114Mr Bingley rides towards Longbourn, a look of slight
          trepidation in his eyes. Darcy now comes into view riding
          along side him. They cross the moat bridge.115 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN -- DAY. 115Mary is practising her scales. Jane and Elizabeth are
          sitting at their work, with their mother. Kitty rushes
          in.KITTYHe is here! He is here, he's at the door!�MRS BENNETOh my goodness! Everybody act naturally.
          Jane completely freezes. Everybody else goes into a
          fluster.MRS BENNET (CONT'D)Whatever you do, do not appear
          overbearing.
          Kitty looks out through a window.KITTYLook. There's someone with him. Mr whats
          his name. The pompous one from before.
          Elizabeth looks through the window at Darcy, her heart
          leaps to her mouth.MRS BENNETMr Darcy indeed! The very insolence of
          0 0 it. What does he think of coming here?
          Elizabeth returns to her seat and sits down, heavily. Mrs
          Bennet hurries over to Jane and pinches her cheeks.� JANEMama!106.MRS BENNET• (to Mary - who is stillPLAYING)Stop that and sit down! Find yourself
          some work! Oh Lord.
          They sit there, frozen, pretending to sew. The drawing
          room door opens and Mrs Hill shows in the two men. They
          bow. Bingley smiles warmly at Jane, who blushes.
          Elizabeth glances at Darcy. His face is strained. Mrs
          Bennet is all smiles for Bingley. She ignores Darcy.MRS BENNET (CONT'D)How very glad we are to see you, Mr
          Bingley! There are a great many changes
          since you went away. Miss Lucas is
          married and settled. And one of my own
          daughters too, you will have seen it in
          the papers though it was not put in as it
          ought to have been. Very short, nothing
          about her family.BINGLEY(SMILES)I did hear of it, and offer my
          congratulations.MRS BENNET- but it's very hard to have my Lydia
          taken away from me. Mr Wickham has been
          transferred to Newcastle, where ever that
          is. Thank heaven he has some friends.
          Mrs Bennet shoots a frosty glance at Mr Darcy. This is
          more than Elizabeth can bare.ELIZABETHDo you hope to stay long in the country,
          Mr Bingley?BINGLEYJust a few weeks. For the shooting.MRS BENNETWhen you have killed all your own birds,
          Mr Bingley, I beg you will come here and
          shoot as many as you please.MR BINGLEYThank you -MRS BENNET- Mr Bennet will be vastly happy to
          oblige you, and will save all the best of
          • the covies for you.107,MR BINGLEY�Excellent.ELIZABETHAre you well, Mr Darcy?DARCYQuite well, thank you.ELIZABETHWell, I hope the weather stays fine, for
          your sport.DARCYI return to town tomorrow.ELIZABETH(A PAUSE)So soon?MRS BENNETMy Jane looks well, does she not?
          Mr-Bingley stands up abruptly.BINGLEYShe does indeed. Well, I must be going, I
          suppose. Darcy -
          Darcy cannot quite believe it. He gives Bingley a harsh
          stare, Bingley has not completed his task.BINGLEY (CONT`D)It was very pleasant to see you all
          again. Elizabeth, Miss Jane..
          Bingley can almost not bear to look Jane in the eye as he
          acknowledges them all very briefly and bolts for the
          door. Mrs Bennet fusses around him.MRS BENNETYou must come again. For when you were in
          town last winter you promised to take a
          family dinner with us. I have not forgot
          you see. At least three courses.
          Bingley and Darcy take their leave, leaving the Bennets
          sitting in silence all looking at once another. Kitty is
          fit to burst out laughing, Elizabeth and Jane horrified
          by the awkward visit.116 EXT. THE LANE - NEAR LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 116• Bingley is pacing backwards and forwards in despair
          muttering to himself. Darcy looks at him in extreme
          frustration.108.BINGLEYOh damn, damn, buggery, damn.DARCYWhat were you thinking of?
          It's as if Bingley has not heard. He keeps pacing up and
          down.BINGLEYDamn and blast, oh buggery, damn.117 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - DAY. 117The girls are now spread around the room. Jane in.

          meet as indifferent acquaintances.ELIZABETH(LAUGHING)Oh yes? Jane, take care.JANEYou cannot think me so weak as to be in�danger now.ELIZABETHI think you are in great danger of making
          him as much in love with you as ever.JANEI'm sorry, though, that he came with Mr
          Darcy.ELIZABETH(BLURTS OUT)Oh Jane, I have acted so stupidly. Had I
          been in love, I could not have been more

          The door bell rings.KITTY(at the window)
          It is him. He's back. He's come again.
          • A stunned reaction.CUT TO:109.Everyone has regained their decorous positions. They hear�Bingley's voice at the door and he comes in very
          awkwardly. He smiles. His face is crimson with
          embarrassment.BINGLEYI, erm, I know this is all very
          embarrassing, but I would like to request
          the privilege of speaking to Miss Jane -

          Immediately. Oh, Mr Bingley. It is so
          good to see you again so soon.
          She ushers everyone out, not before squeezing Jane's
          hand. Now Jane and Bingley are alone, facing each other
          with extreme embarrassment.BINGLEYMiss Bennet, you have been the victim of
          a huge misunderstanding. Suffice to say,
          I have been an unmitigated and
          comprehensive ass. And therefore, I would

          inside.MARYSsssshhh!
          Elizabeth is apart from her family. She cannot bear to be
          there. She walks down the corridor and out of the house
          into the garden. Through a window she sees Bingley on one
          knee, her eyes fill with tears as she walks away from the
          house.- CUT TO:119 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 119• Bingley looks at Jane, desperately worried. A pause.JANE• Yes. A hundred times - yes.
          Mrs Bennet and the girls throw open the double doors to
          the drawing room and come crashing in. Bingley and Jane
          beam at them.MRS BENNETThank the Lord for that. I thought it
          would never happen.120 EXT. GARDEN -- LONGBOURN -- THE SAME. 120Elizabeth is sat under a tree crying.121 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - OVER LOOKING LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 121Darcy looks down at Longbourn.122 INT. BEDROOM - LONGBOURN - NIGHT. 122Mr Bennet and Mrs Bennet are in bed.MR BENNETI am sure they will do well together,�their tempers are much alike. They will
          be cheated assiduously by their servants,

          beautiful for nothing.

          What is that?
          More noise, it sounds like a carriage, then a loud
          banging on the door downstairs. The girls look at each
          other.124 INT. DOWNSTAIRS -- LONGBOURN - NIGHT. 12.4-Mr Bennet, Mrs Bennet and the girls lit by only candles

          report exists.LADY CATHERINEIf? Do you then pretend to be ignorant of
          it? Has it not been industriously
          circulated by yourself?ELIZABETHI have never heard of it.LADY CATHERINEAnd can you declare there is no
          foundation for it?ELIZABETHI do not pretend to possess equal
          frankness with your ladyship. You may ask
          the questions, which I may not choose to
          answer.LADY CATHERINEThis is not to be borne. Has my nephew
          made you an offer of marriage?ISELIZABETHYour Ladyship declared it to be
          impossible.LADY CATHERINELet me be understood. Mr Darcy is engaged
          to my daughter. Now what have you to say?ELIZABETHOnly this - if that is the case you can
          have no reason to suppose he will make an
          offer to me.LADY CATHERINEOh obstinate girl! This union has been
          planned since their infancy. Do you think
          it can be prevented by a young woman of
          inferior birth, of no importance in the
          world and wholly unallied to his family?
          Whose own sister's elopement resulted in
          the scandalously patched-up marriage,
          only achieved at the expense of your
          uncle? Heaven and earth, are the shades
          of Pemberly to be thus polluted? Now tell
          me once and for all, are you engaged to
          him?�ELIZABETHI am not.114.LADY CATHERINEAnd will you promise never to enter into
          such an engagement?ELIZABETHI will not. And I certainly never shall.
          Allow me to say, the arguments which you
          have supported this extraordinary
          application have been as frivolous as the
          application was ill-judged. You have,
          insulted me in every possible method and
          can now have nothing further to say. I
          must ask you to leave immediately. Good
          night.
          Elizabeth throws open.the door, revealing the family
          outside.LADY CATHERINEI have never been thus treated in my
          entire life.
          Lady Catherine storms past the family and out into the
          night. Elizabeth is standing shaking with the excitement
          of having stood so firmly up for herself.MR BENNETLizzie, what on earth is going on?�ELIZABETHJust a small misunderstanding.
          She walks past them to bed.MRS BENNETLizzie!ELIZABETHFor once in your life. Just leave me
          alone.
          Everyone looks aghast at Elizabeth's reaction.126 INT. BEDROOM - LONGBOURN - NIGHT. 126Jane is fast asleep. Elizabeth unable to sleep. She
          quietly climbs out of bed and creeps out of the room.127 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN -- THE SAME. 127Elizabeth sits alone downstairs, thinking. Outside we see
          dawn is breaking.115.�128 EXT. LONGBOURN - DAWN. 128Elizabeth creeps out into the garden and wanders around
          through the early morning mist, as the sun starts to
          rise.129 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE OVERLOOKING LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 129Elizabeth walks out into the open countryside. The mists
          are starting to evaporate. From out of the mist in the
          distance a figure emerges. Her heart misses a beat. She
          is alone, vulnerable. Then she sees it is Darcy.ELIZABETHMr Darcy!DARCYWhat are you doing out here so early?ELIZABETHI could not sleep.DARCYMe neither. I have been up.most of the
          night.�Elizabeth hardly knows how to react at this unexpected
          meeting. Rather politely she thanks Mr Darcy.ELIZABETHMr Darcy, I must thank you for your
          unexampled generosity to both my sisters.
          I know what kindnesses you have done for
          poor Lydia and suspect your hand in the
          happy resolution for Jane also.DARCYI am alarmed that you know of what I have
          been so in earnest to keep silent. But
          you must know that your happiness was one
          of my prime inducements.
          Elizabeth looks at Darcy.DARCY (CONT`D)I know you are too generous to trifle
          with me. I believe you spoke with my Aunt
          last night, and it has taught me to hope
          as I had scarcely allowed myself before.
          If your feelings are still what they were
          last April, tell me so at once. My
          affections and wishes are unchanged, but�one word from you will silence me
          forever.116.Elizabeth is silent.0DARCY (CONT'D)If, however, your feelings have
          changed...
          Elizabeth gazes at him.DARCY (CONT'D)I would have to tell you, you have
          bewitched me body and soul and I love and
          love and love you. And never wish to be
          parted from you from this day on.
          Elizabeth looks at him. She does not say a word. Darcy is
          staring at her for a reply. A tear rolls down Elizabeth's
          cheek.ELIZABETHI am very happy to inform you that not
          only have my sentiments changed there are
          no other words which could give me
          greater pleasure.
          Darcy stares at her. They both start to cry. Darcy very,
          very slowly and gently touches her face. She closes her
          eyes. They kiss. She touches his face with her hand, the
          kiss becomes passionate.130 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - DUSK. 130The place is in an uproar. Bingley, Jane, Mary, Kitty, Mr
          and Mrs Bennet are all gathered, fretting terribly about
          Elizabeth's whereabouts. Through a window we see
          Elizabeth lead Darcy along the duck board plank across
          the moat. Elizabeth enters the house, everybody starts.MRS BENNETLizzie, where have you been. We thought
          something had happened to you.
          Darcy follows Elizabeth in.MRS BENNET (CONT'D)Mr Darcy! What on earth are you doing
          here?
          Elizabeth takes Mr Darcy's hand.ELIZABETHMr Darcy has come to speak with Papa.
          Everyone is stunned.0CUT TO117.• 131 INT. HALLWAY/LIBRARY - LONGBOURN - DAY. 131Elizabeth paces outside the door of the library, waiting.
          After a while Darcy emerges, he gives Elizabeth the
          briefest of smiles and leaves the door open. Elizabeth
          walks in. Her father is in a state of shock.MR BENNETLizzie, are you out of your senses? I
          thought you hated the man.ELIZABETHNo, Papa.MR BENNETHe is rich, to be sure, and you will have
          more fine carriages than Jane. But will
          that make you happy?ELIZABETH(UNCOMFORTABLE)Have you no other objection than your
          belief in my indifference?MR BENNETNone at all. We all know him to be a
          proud, unpleasant sort of fellow, but
          this would be nothing if you really liked
          him.ELIZABETH(tears in her eyes)
          I do like him!(WITH PASSION)I love him! He's not proud. It's I who's
          been prejudiced, who didn't realize ...
          You don't know him, Papa...if I told you
          what he's really like. What he's done.MR BENNETWhat has he done?CUT TO:132 EXT. GARDEN -- LONGBOURN - DAY. 132Darcy, in an agony, paces up and down the lawn. He looks
          at the library window.CUT BACK TO:• 133 INT. LIBRARY - LONGBOURN - DAY. 133Mr Bennet stares at his daughter.118.MR BENNETGood Lord. I must pay him back.ELIZABETH(shakes her head)
          No, you mustn't tell anyone! He wouldn't
          want it.(PAUSE)We misjudged him, me more than anyone. In
          every way,not just in this matter. I've
          been so blind. He's been so blind! About
          Jane, about so many things. Then so haveI...(BREATHLESS PAUSE)You see, he and I are so similiar...we're
          both so stubborn...(SHAKY LAUGH)Oh Papa...
          Mr Bennet gazes at his daughter-. He still can't quite
          take it in.MR BENNETYou do love him, don't you?
          Elizabeth nods.ELIZABETH• Very much.
          He looks at her earnestly, searching her face. He loves
          his daughter very deeply. What he sees leaves him in no
          doubt.MR BENNETI cannot believe that anyone can deserve
          you, but it seems I am over-ruled. So I
          heartily give my consent.
          Elizabeth jumps up and puts her arms around him.MR BENNETI could not have parted with you, my
          Lizzie, to any one less worthy.ELIZABETHOh thank you!
          She starts to rush out.MR BENNET(calls out after her)
          And if any young men come for Mary or
          Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at
          • leisure.119.• 134 EXT. PEMBERLY - NIGHT. 134We move through a vast wedding party, following Elizabeth
          and Darcy. We meet all our characters. Lydia and Wickham
          are missing. Let everyone have an end.
          Darcy and Elizabeth kiss, then Darcy pulls Elizabeth off
          into the shadows. We see them disappear into the park.
          Coming close, we see them in the moonlight. It's Darcy
          and Elizabeth. Deer turn to gaze at them. The music fades
          as they walk further from the house, up the hill, past
          the outcrops of rocks. An owl hoots. Darcy turns to
          Elizabeth and smiles.DARCYAllow me, Mrs Darcy.
          He puts out his hand. She takes it. He helps her up the
          rocks. When they get to the top they sit there, side by
          side, and gaze at the distant lights of Pemberley.ELIZABETHHow did it begin?DARCYI cannot fix the hour, or the spot, or�the look. It was too long ago and I was
          in the middle before I knew it had begun.ELIZABETHNow be sincere, did you admire me for my
          impertinenc?DARCYFor the liveliness of your mind, I did.ELIZABETHYou may as well call it impertinence,
          though make a virtue of it by all means.
          My good qualities are under your
          protection, and you are to exaggerate -
          them as much as possible. And, in return,
          it belongs to me to find occasions for
          teasing and quarrelling with you as often
          as maybe... and I shall begin directly...
          We draw back-their figures diminish, smaller and
          smaller under the immense, star-spangled sky. . .Fainter
          and fainter, the sound of music and laughter...135 FADE TO BLACK... 135�THE END.
