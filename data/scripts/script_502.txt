                                  Nick SchenkFADE IN:INT. CHURCHWe're at the funeral of Dorothy Kowalski. In attendance
          are mostly old folks, their offspring and several bored
          teenagers.
          WALT KOWALSKI stands towards the front of the church. He
          speaks to an older MAN in a bulky, out-of-date suit.OLDER MANI'm real sorry about Dorothy,
          Walt. She was a real peach.WALTThanks for coming, Al.
          Walt Kowalski looks young for his age. He has slate blue
          eyes, physically fit and has had the same buzz cut
          hairstyle since getting out of the military in 1953.
          Walt is also a perfectionist. Nothing escapes his
          hawklike eyes, eyes that pierce and judge.
          Walt looks around at how the young people have dressed at
          his wife's funeral. His eyes narrow at his
          GRANDDAUGHTER's belly button ring.WALTJesus Christ.
          Walt's two sons, MITCH and STEVE, watch their father from
          across the pews.MITCHLook at the Old Man glaring at
          Ashley. He can't even tone it
          down at Mom's funeral?STEVEWhat do you expect? Dad's still
          living in the �50s. He expects
          his granddaughter to dress a
          little more modestly.MITCHYeah, well your kid's wearing a
          Timberwolves jersey. I'm sure Dad
          appreciates that.STEVEMy point is that there's nothing
          anyone can do that won't
          disappoint the Old Man.(MORE)(CONTINUED)PAGE 3It's inevitable. That's why we
          stopped doing Thanksgivings; the
          deal with the boat motor, the
          broken bird bath, it's always
          something.MITCHWhat are we going to do with him?
          Don't you think he'll get in
          trouble by himself over in the old
          neighborhood?STEVEWhy don't you have him move in
          with you?MITCHHa ha.INT. CHURCH - LATERThe choir sings the Beatitudes.
          Walt looks around disgustedly at the people gathered as
          one woman looks through her day planner, an old guy dozes
          and his Granddaughter Ashley applies nail polish.
          FATHER JANOVICH, the very young parish priest, steps up
          to the altar and delivers the eulogy for Walt's wife.
          Walt sits ramrod straight and listens to the thin, weak,
          unconvincing words of Father Janovich.FATHER JANOVICHDeath... is often a bittersweet
          occasion to us Catholics. Bitter
          in the pain it causes the deceased
          ... and their families. Sweet to
          those who know the salvation that
          awaits them. And some may ask,
          what is death. Is it the end? Or
          is it the beginning? And what is
          life? What is this thing we call
          life?WALTJesus.
          Walt coughs. He takes a handkerchief and wipes his lips.
          He looks down and notices a speck of BLOOD on the white
          cloth.CONTINUED:INT. WALT'S HOUSE - SAME TIMEThe house is crammed with people following the service.
          Walt doesn't know what to do with himself. He has to
          keep busy. Steve steps over to his father.STEVEA lot of people showed up after
          the service.WALTYeah, well, I s'pose they knew
          there'd be plenty of ham. I think
          I'll go downstairs and get some
          more chairs.STEVEI'll do it, Dad.WALTNaw, we need them now, not next
          week.INT. CELLAR - SAME TIMEGrandsons JOSH, DANIEL and DAVID look through boxes in
          the cellar. A box of old Korea War photos are pawed
          through.

          Josh holds up a black-and-white PHOTO -- a young WALT
          looks utterly exhausted, behind him six bodies are
          sprawled dead on the ground.DAVIDIs that Dad?DANIELNo, it's Grandpa Walt.
          Josh turns the photo over and reads it...JOSH�Third Platoon, E company, March
          second, 1952, Korea.'DANIELWhere's Korea?JOSHHell if I know?
          David holds up a MEDAL.3.(CONTINUED)PAGE 5DAVIDCool, I found a medal.
          They hear someone coming downstairs. By the time Walt
          descends the staircase, the boys sit on the couch,
          pretending to be doing nothing.
          Walt gives them a hard look as he grabs some chairs.UPSTAIRS55People eat and chat. Ashley marches over to her parents,
          KAREN and Mitch.ASHLEY (GRANDDAUGHTER)How long do we have to stay, this
          ghetto is a dead zone for my cell
          and I'm bored.
          Walt stands behind them with an armful of folding chairs,
          he overheard his Granddaughter. Mitch and Karen are
          embarrassed.MITCHAshley, honey. Why don't you help
          Grandpa Walt with the chairs?ASHLEYMe?KARENYes you.ASHLEYGrandpa Walt, can I help you with
          the chairs.WALTI'll take care of it, you just
          painted your nails.
          Walt opens the folding chairs and looks out the window.
          It's snowing. Walt puts on his coat, he almost looks
          relieved to get out of the house.WALTI'd better salt the sidewalk
          before someone falls and breaks a
          hip.
          Walt taps the floor with his boot and DAISY, his very,
          very, very old DOG follows him outside.4.CONTINUED:44PAGE 6EXT. WALT'S HOUSE - EVENING66Walt carefully shovels his sidewalk. He deliberately
          stops at the boundary of his property.
          The reason for this is that Walt's neighbors are now
          mostly Asians who moved into the house that once belonged
          to Polish families.
          Next door to Walt's house some sort of party is going on.
          Walt can see through the window that the living room is
          jammed with at least forty people, all Asians, all Hmong.
          And this is a problem for Walt, because Walt is a full-
          blown, unrepentant racist.
          Walt lights a cigarette and speaks to his dog, Daisy.WALTJesus Christ, how many swamp rats
          can they cram into a living room?
          Walt spits in the snow and walks back to the garage.INT. GARAGE - SAME TIME77Walt steps inside and catches Ashley sneaking a
          cigarette. She has pulled back the canvas tarp that
          covers his pride and joy, his beloved 1972 GRAN TORINO.
          The Gran Torino is in mint condition. It has been babied
          since the day it rolled off the line.
          Ashley tosses her cigarette when she sees Grandpa Walt.ASHLEYWow, Grandpa, when'd you get the
          vintage car?
          Walt looks at her for a second, then steps on her still
          burning cigarette before answering.WALT1972.ASHLEYI never knew you had a cool old
          car.WALTIt's only been in here since
          before you were born.5.(CONTINUED)PAGE 7ASHLEYSo, what are you like going to do
          with it like, when... you die?
          Walt lights up a smoke --WALTJesus, Joseph and Mary.
          Walt pulls the cover back over the Gran Torino.ASHLEYThen what about that super cool
          retro couch in the den, I'm going
          to State next year and I don't
          have, like, any furniture?
          Walt walks out without commenting.BACK IN WALT'S HOUSE88The doorbell rings and Walt opens the door. Standing
          there is TAO, a sixteen-year-old HMONG boy. Walt scowls.
          TAO is slight, he has long hair, long lashes, but is very
          good-looking -- like an Asian Johnny Depp.WALTWho the hell are you?TAO(very quietly)
          I'm Tao, I live next door.WALTWhat?! Speak up, boy, get the
          shit out of your mouth. What do
          you want?TAODo you have jumper cables? My
          uncle's car is old and...WALTNo. And have some goddamned
          respect, zipper head, we're
          mourning over here.
          Walt slams the door in Tao's face.
          Walt turns and is suddenly cornered by Father Janovich.
          Walt hates situations like this.6.CONTINUED:77(CONTINUED)PAGE 8FATHER JANOVICHHow you holding up, Walt?WALTMr. Kowalski.FATHER JANOVICHHuh?WALTIt's Mr. Kowalski, not Walt.FATHER JANOVICHRight, Mr. Kowalski. Your wife
          and I became quite close these
          last few months. She asked that I
          watch over you when she passed on.
          I told her I watch out for my
          entire flock, but she made me
          promise I'd keep an extra sharp
          eye on you.WALTI appreciate your kindness to my
          wife and now that you've spoken
          your piece, why don't you move on
          to the next sheep?
          Walt starts to step away, but Father Janovich blocks him.FATHER JANOVICHDorothy mentioned specifically
          that it was her wish for you to go
          to confession. She said she
          couldn't remember the last time
          you went.WALTIs that so?FATHER JANOVICHIt is.
          Walt drains his lowball glass.WALTWell, I confess I never much liked
          church and only went because of
          the wife. And I confess I have no
          desire to confess to a boy who is
          fresh out of the seminary.7.CONTINUED:88PAGE 9EXT. WALT'S HOUSE - LATER99People are leaving Walt's house. A mass of shuffling,
          stiff-jointed old Pollacks.
          Right next door -- walking the opposite direction are
          more Hmong going up the sidewalk. They laugh and chatter
          and carry big dishes of food and fruit. They are a happy
          bunch compared to the dour crowd exiting Walt's home.
          The Hmong are going to a birth ceremony. A three-day-old
          baby is named and three souls are located for the
          newborn.CUT TO:ANOTHER ANGLEWalt leans over a car that contains two shivering old
          ladies from the funeral. He hooks up the jumper cables
          to their dead battery.
          Mitch, Karen, Ashley and Josh pull up next to Walt in a
          brand new Toyota Land Cruiser. Mitch opens the window.MITCHI'd really like to help, Dad, but
          we have to get the kids home,
          they're getting restless.
          Walt just looks at the TOYOTA EMBLEM on the Land Cruiser
          and then gives Mitch a disgusted glance.WALTFine. Go.MITCHI'll call in a few, see how you're
          doing.
          Walt nods and lights a cigarette as they drive off.WALTKill you to buy American.INT. LAND CRUISER - SAME TIME1010MITCHDid you see him look at the truck?
          It's always Rice-Burner this or
          Jap-Buggy that. Even at Mom's
          funeral, he can't let it go.8.(CONTINUED)PAGE 10KARENAt least he didn't say anything
          this time.MITCHHe didn't have to.KARENWell, what do you expect? The man
          worked at a Ford plant for twenty-
          eight years.MITCHAnd I suppose that's my goddamned
          fault?BACK ON WALT1111Walt gets his guests' engine running.
          As they drive off, Walt hears faint SINGING. Walt looks
          into his neighbor's backyard and can't believe his eyes.
          The Hmong all sing and chant as three CHICKENS have their
          heads sliced off, right there in the yard.
          The chickens are held up and everyone chants louder.
          It's a sacrifice. Walt spits in the snow and says to
          Daisy.WALTBarbarians. Goddamned barbarians.INT. HMONG HOUSE NEXT DOOR - SAME TIME1212The house is a buzz of activity. The older Hmong speak
          their native language, the younger generation speaks both
          English and Hmong.
          (NOTE: Hmong is subtitled when necessary.)
          Tao's Grandmother (PHONG) complains to a MAN.PHONG(SUBTITLED)There's no man in this house,
          that's why my daughter should
          remarry. Being a second wife is
          better than having a woman be the
          head of the household. It's not
          our way.9.CONTINUED:1010(CONTINUED)PAGE 11MAN(SUBTITLED)What about Tao?PHONG(SUBTITLED)What about him?MAN(SUBTITLED)He's the man in the house.PHONG(SUBTITLED)Tao's not a man.(GESTURES)Look at him in the kitchen,
          washing dishes like a woman. Even
          his sister gives him orders and he
          obeys.
          The CAMERA PANS TO the kitchen where TAO washes a pile of
          dishes. An older relative drops dishes in the sink,
          without acknowledging Tao's presence. It's clearly an
          insult.
          In the LIVING ROOM the Hmong �Soul Calling� ceremony
          starts its next phase. An elder, the family SHAMAN, is
          present and begins the ritual.
          As the entire Hmong family gathers to watch. Tao slips
          on his coat and goes out the back door.EXT. TAO'S HOUSE - SAME TIME1313Tao wobbles as he pedals his bike through the snow.
          Tao passes Walt's garage and is startled as Walt appears
          from a shadow, JUMPER CABLES in his hands. They make eye
          contact as Tao passes.
          Walt spits in the snow and looks down at Daisy.WALTI thought these zips were supposed
          to be such hard workers. Christ,
          I had my own car when I was his
          age.EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT1414Tao exits the store, gets on his bike and rides off.10.CONTINUED:1212(CONTINUED)PAGE 12A few blocks away, Tao rides past a snowbank when --
          WHAM! A HOCKEY STICK is thrown through the spokes of his
          front wheel. Tao flies over the handlebars into the
          snow.
          A chorus of laughter is heard. Three LATINOS stand
          around the stunned, prone Tao.HEAD LATINOWhatta you gonna do, gook? You
          gonna �Kung Fu' us?
          Tao just lies there as Latino #2 picks up his bike.LATINO #2Surprised it ain't a girl's bike.
          The Latinos laugh. Tao remains on the ground.HEAD LATINOYou gonna get up or what?
          Tao doesn't move.HEAD LATINOTell you what, I'll let you take
          the first swing. You drop me and
          you can have your bike back.
          Tao smiles, he can't help it.HEAD LATINOWhat the fuck you smiling at,
          gook? Something funny?
          He grabs Tao by the jacket and pulls him to his feet.HEAD LATINOYou better get the fuck outta
          here, bitch.
          He pushes Tao backwards. Tao falls back into the snow.
          This time Tao crab-walks back away from the Latinos.
          The Latinos stroll away with Tao's bike.EXT. WALT'S HOUSE - SUNNY SPRING MORNING1515SUPERIMPOSE: THREE MONTHS LATERWalt is going about the chores of spring cleaning.11.CONTINUED:1414(CONTINUED)PAGE 13Walt looks around with disdain at his neighbors' houses.
          Walt's property is perfectly kept, whereas his neighbors'
          houses are rundown.
          Walt's eyes linger on every defect, gutter hangs, ripped
          screen doors, peeling paint. One neighbor has installed
          a chicken coop.
          Walt looks down at Daisy --WALTDamn chinks let their yards go to
          hell. Polarski would turn over in
          his grave if he could see what
          they did to his lawn.
          Tao walks past. Walt watches him pass.WALTI don't know why these goddamned
          slopes had to move to my block.
          This used to be a nice
          neighborhood.EXT. TAO'S HOUSE - SAME TIME1616Tao nods to an older woman rocking in a broken rocking
          chair. PHONG nods back to Tao, then turns her evil eye
          back on Walt, whom she's been seething at all morning.PHONG(SUBTITLED)Why doesn't that stupid, hairy
          white man move? He must be too
          dumb to realize he's not welcome
          here. All the Mee-Khah left in
          the neighborhood should just move
          away. Look at him strut like a
          rooster.
          She sees Walt glance at her and spit. Phong glares back
          and spits beetle juice, which has turned her teeth black.INT. WALT'S HOUSE - DAY1717Daisy snoozes next to the front door. The doorbell
          rings; Daisy doesn't even move. Walt walks to the front
          door holding a roll of duct tape. The doorbell rings
          again.
          Walt looks down at Daisy --12.CONTINUED:1515(CONTINUED)PAGE 14WALTJesus Christ, dog, have you gone
          totally deaf?
          Walt opens the door. Standing on his front step is
          Father Janovich.FATHER JANOVICHHi there, Walt.WALTListen, son, you're not my barber,

          me, Mr. Kowalski?WALTYou don't want to know.FATHER JANOVICHNo, I do.WALTThe problem is I think you're an
          overeducated, 27-year-old virgin
          who holds the hands of
          superstitious old women and
          promises them eternity.13.CONTINUED:1717(CONTINUED)PAGE 15Walt shuts the front door in Father Janovich's face.EXT. STREET - DAY1818Tao walks down the street, his head in a book. He
          finally realizes there's a blue Chevy following slowly
          behind him.
          The blue Chevy is now parallel with Tao and keeps pace
          with his step. Tao looks over to the occupants of the
          Chevy.
          It's two LATINOS. Tao quickens his pace, but the Chevy
          easily keeps up with Tao.LATINO DRIVERIs you a boy or a girl, I can't
          tell?LATINO #2What you reading, gook, Jackass
          And The Rice Stalk?
          Tao laughs, but keeps walking.LATINO DRIVERThat's right, you keep walking.
          Fucking slopes everywhere you
          look, man. Why gooks come up in
          here and fuck up our neighborhood?
          Down the street -- is a suped-up HONDA CIVIC with a big
          SPOILER on the back. Inside are five Hmong gangbangers.
          The Hmong gangbangers notice Tao being followed by the
          Latinos. SPIDER, the driver, squints and then points at
          Tao.SPIDERDude, that's my little cousin,
          Tao.SMOKIEYou sure about that, Spider?SPIDERI'm sure. Do we do something...
          or what?
          Smokie is the gang leader. He looks at Tao for a second.SMOKIEYour cousin tight with anyone?14.CONTINUED: (2)1717(CONTINUED)PAGE 16SPIDERNo, he flies solo, Smokie.SMOKIEOkay. Let's go help out our
          little cousin.
          Smokie nods to Spider, they roar up and stop right across
          from Tao and the Latinos' car.SMOKIEYou better not be giving my bro
          here a hard time or you're gonna
          wish you never been born.LATINO DRIVEROh goody, more Rice Niggers.
          The Latino Driver smiles and flashes a PISTOL.
          A Hmong kid in the back seat opens the door and displays
          a sub-machine gun. The Latinos are way out-gunned.LATINO #2Fucking Viet Cong swamp rats. Go
          back to your fucking rice paddy.
          The Latinos screech their tires and are gone. The Hmongs
          in the car smile and congratulate themselves.
          Tao simply keeps walking down the street!SMOKIEWhere the fuck does he think he's
          going? Turn us around and go
          after that cousin of yours.
          They swing a U-turn and pull up to Tao, keeping pace with
          him as he walks.SPIDERHey, cuz, slow down, where you
          going? You should really think
          about hanging with us, man. If we
          all stick together, shit like that
          won't happen, with those Spicks.
          Tao nods as he walks, but doesn't answer.SPIDERYou can't be such a little girl.
          You join up with us, we'll keep
          you out of trouble, cuz.15.CONTINUED:1818(CONTINUED)PAGE 17Tao looks at the sub-machine gun cradled by the Hmong

          about?
          A PAUSE. Smokie watches Tao carefully, offers him a
          cigarette. Tao shakes his head �no� and looks at the
          ground.SMOKIEThat's exactly the point, Tao.

          need a little guidance.

          be kind of a quiet little punk

          The dog sleeps in her bed in the corner. Walt looks at

          Walt pulls on his robe, opens the closet and pulls out
          the big, 30-06 M1 Garand Rifle he took home from Korea.

          Walt is silent, he has one eye closed so he can better
          aim at Tao's forehead -- which is nine inches away. Tao
          drops the tool he was holding, it bounces with a loud
          metallic clang.
          Tao backs away, his eyes wide with terror. As Tao backs
          up, Walt advances, step for step.
          Tao trips over a garden hose, which causes Walt to trip.
          They both start to fall. The lightbulb is bumped with
          the rifle barrel and swings back and forth.
          As Walt hits the garage floor, he accidentally FIRES THE
          RIFLE. The bullet goes through a big, metal Hamm's Beer
          sign on the wall.
          Tao scrambles to his feet and jumps like a deer over
          Walt. Tao runs out of the garage and into the night.
          Walt lies on the floor for a second, stunned. Sweat runs
          down his forehead. He coughs up blood. The lightbulb
          still swings, casting odd shadows in the garage.WALTShit.EXT. ALLEY - SAME TIME2424Tao scrambles down the alley. Parked off to the side is

          chair and walks stiffly back into the garage.
          Walt flips on the outdoor light, highlighting the Gran
          Torino still sitting at an angle in the driveway. The
          whole scene looks like a mid-sixties car ad in Popular
          Mechanics.
          Walt goes in the back door and a moment later the kitchen
          light comes on. The Gran Torino remains in the driveway.

          gangbangers keep Mom, Grandma and Sue at bay.
          A middle-aged Hmong Man from across the street comes into
          the yard. All the gangbangers overreact and pull their
          pistols. The middle-aged Hmong Man gets in Spider's face
          and is cracked across the jaw with a pistol barrel.
          Tao back-pedals away from Spider and Smokie. It becomes

          Walt says nothing.FATHER JANOVICHI've been thinking about our
          discussion on life and death.
          About what you said. About how
          you carry around the horrible
          things you were forced to do.
          Horrible things that won't leave
          you. It seems that it would do
          you good to unload some of that
          burden. Things done during war
          are terrible, being ordered to
          kill, killing to save others,
          killing to save yourself. You're
          right, those are things I don't
          know anything about. But I do
          know about forgiveness. And I've
          seen a lot of men who have
          confessed their sins, admitted
          their guilt and left their burdens
          behind them. Stronger men than
          you. Men at war who were ordered
          to do appalling things and are now
          at peace.

          the three black guys who block their path.
          One black guy flips Trey's VISOR onto the ground. The
          Tall Guy makes �kissy faces� at Sue as he touches his
          crotch.

          solves every situation by being aggressive.

          relative. Walt notices an Old Hmong Man staring at him.
          Walt interrupts Sue.WALTHey, Sue.SUEWhat?WALTYou said you guys don't look you
          in the eye, but that guy keeps
          staring at me.
          Sue laughs and gestures to the Old Hmong Man. The Old
          Hmong Man steps over and nods to Walt.48.CONTINUED:4444(CONTINUED)PAGE 50SUEThis is Kor Khue. He's the Lor
          family shaman.WALTWitch doctor?

          hold their clan Shaman in very
          high regards.WALTBoo-ga, boo-ga.
          Kor Khue says something to Sue in Hmong. She turns and
          translates to Walt.SUEKor Khue is interested in you, he
          heard what you did. He says he
          would like to read you.WALTHuh?SUEHe wants to read you. Tell you

          away.
          Sue speaks Hmong to the Shaman. The Shaman responds and
          sits down across from Walt. He looks at Walt for a long
          time.
          Walt stares straight back at him. The Shaman mumbles to
          himself.
          Finally the Shaman turns to Sue and speaks very rapidly.
          As Sue translates, the Shaman watches Walt's reaction.SUEKor Khue says that you think
          you've been disrespected. You do
          not live your life. Your food has
          no flavor. You are scared of your

          Walt looks like he's been hit by a truck. The Shaman
          watches Walt closely, he knows he hit the nail on the
          head.
          Walt looks pale. He's been spooked good. He wipes sweat
          from his forehead.WALTExcuse me.
          Walt gets up and steps into the kitchen. He takes
          several deep breaths. He's pretty shook up.WALTJe -- zuz -- Christ.
          Walt looks around at all the Hmongs eating and carrying
          on.
          Walt sees a young man give up his seat to an Elder.
          Walt sees a young woman go to each of the older folks and
          offer tea and cookies from a tray.
          Walt sees a child help an old man out of the bathroom.
          Walt coughs hard. He wipes blood from his lips. Sue
          comes in and looks at Walt.SUEAre you okay?

          lived in 50 years, he hasn't relaxed or exhaled or let

          Walt smiles disarmingly.WALTI just bit my tongue. I'm fine.

          delight in feeding him different Hmong dishes which he's
          obviously never tasted before.
          Walt reacts with great enthusiasm to the food,
          occasionally making jokes like he's choking, etc. This
          corny stuff goes over like gangbusters with the Hmong
          ladies.

          his element down with all the Hmong teenagers.
          And the first person he sees across the room is Tao.WALTOh great.SUEWell, look who's over there.WALTWhat's-his-name who tried to steal
          my Gran Torino.SUEMy brother Tao.WALTYeah, Toad.
          Tao is in the corner, he avoids Walt's gaze. Sue walks
          over to a group of boys, leaving Walt alone.
          Walt doesn't know what to do with himself. He leans
          against the DRYER. The DRYER wobbles.
          Walt gets on his hands and knees. He looks under the
          dryer. He adjusts the short leg to balance out the
          machine.
          He just can't help it.
          All the Hmong kids watch Walt, trying not to laugh at
          this strange white man on his hands and knees fixing a
          dryer during a party. Walt looks up -- deer in the
          headlights.WALTIt was wobbly, but I fixed it.
          It's fine now, shouldn't wobble
          anymore.
          The Hmong kids look away, covering their mouths with
          their hands.
          Walt glares at Tao, who immediately wipes the smile from
          his face. Sue walks over and hands Walt a drink.WALTWhat's this?52.(CONTINUED)PAGE 54SUERice liquor. Try it.WALTAlright.
          Sue walks off. Walt sips his rice liquor and watches the
          interaction between the boys and girls.
          One particularly gorgeous young willow-wisp of a GIRL
          stares across the room at Tao. Tao looks back at her,
          but then looks away.
          The Girl keeps looking at Tao, smiling and twisting her
          hair.
          Tao doesn't approach her, but three other young men do.
          They do their best to charm her. She's polite, but not
          interested, she keeps looking at Tao.
          Walt laughs at Tao's ineptitude, shakes his head at this
          wasted opportunity. Suddenly the Girl steps over to
          Walt.
          She smiles --WA XAM (GIRL)My friends and I were just

          She laughs at Walt butchering her name and goes upstairs.
          The three young suitors follow her up. Tao watches her.

          Tao looks like he wants to run away.WALTI wouldn't say anything either, if

          Walt looks at a pale, blue pamphlet. Mitch looks at his
          housekeeping bill.WALTNo. Nope.
          Another pause.WALTOkay then.MITCHOkay. Yeah, so it's not a good

          Walt hangs up. He lies down on his bed.65.CONTINUED:6464PAGE 67EXT. WALT'S FRONT YARD - DAY6565While Walt fills a bird feeder, he notices Tao next door.
          Tao stands, tiptoed on the top of a six-foot ladder,
          trying to cut a high branch with a pole saw.
          Walt shakes his head and walks over to Tao.WALTHey, moron.
          Tao is startled and almost falls off the ladder.TAOWhat?WALTI appreciate you're doing
          something on your own, but you're
          the only person I know dumb enough
          to get himself killed trimming
          tree branches.TAOWhat now?WALTYou don't stand on the top step of
          a ladder and if you cut through
          that branch you're hacking away
          at, you'll end up kaput.
          Tao looks and sure enough -- a thick, black POWER LINE is
          five feet below the branch he's almost severed.WALTGo grab the extension ladder from
          my garage and I'll show you how to
          do it right, zipper head.CUT TO:EXT. TAO'S YARD - LATER6666Tao ties up bundles of branches and twigs. Walt lights a

          when you're done raking up the
          leaves.TAOI know. I will.
          Walt walks back over to his porch, grabs a Pabst from the
          cooler and watches Tao rake.
          A white Honda turns the corner and drives slowly past
          Tao.
          Smokie and Spider smile menacingly at Tao as they pass.WALTThis kid doesn't have a chance.
          The Honda now slowly passes Walt's house. Walt just
          stands there, sipping his beer.
          The Honda slows to a stop and the gangbangers glare at
          Walt.
          The REAR WINDOW of the Honda opens.
          Walt holds out his RIGHT HAND like a GUN. He closes one
          eye to better �aim� his imaginary gun and moves his thumb
          several times as if firing. Bang -- bang -- bang.
          The Honda takes off. Walt watches it drive off and
          lights another cigarette.

          interaction from his yard.INT. WALT'S ENTRYWAY - MORNING6767The doorbell rings.

          here, turn on the fan.
          Tao flips the switch on the CEILING FAN, the fan wobbles
          and shakes, it looks like it's about to fly off.
          Walt stares up at the fan and shakes his head.INT. WALT'S GARAGE6969The CEILING FAN and FAUCET are taken apart on the
          workbench. Walt reinstalls the diverter valve. Tao

          stuff?WALTWhat are you talking about?TAOAll the tools and stuff.WALTWhere the hell do you think I got
          them, Toad? This may come as a
          shock to a thief, but I actually
          bought the things I have with
          money I earned.TAOYeah, yeah, yeah, that's not what

          he's too uncomfortable to speak up --WALTWhat?TAOI can't afford to buy all this
          stuff.WALTI didn't buy all this stuff at
          once, blockhead. I've lived here
          for fifty years. A man stays in
          one place long enough he tends to
          attract a decent set of tools.TAOYeah, but...WALTLook, kid, I think I know where
          you're going with this. You don't
          need everything to maintain a

          tape, can of WD-40 and a pair of
          vise-grips. Any man who's worth a

          That's not good, you should see a

          Tao holds up the MEDAL. He looks at it closely.

          and authority which startles Tao.WALTYou want to know how it feels to
          kill a man? It feels goddamned

          in Hmong as Walt walks straight up to her.WALTAw, pipe down, you hag.PHONG(SUBTITLED)You're an evil man. I've seen

          Walt holds the leash closer. Phong folds her arms in
          defiance. Walt exhales loudly.
          Walt lifts up one of the LEGS OF HER LAWNCHAIR and slips
          the loop of the leash underneath it so Daisy can't follow
          him.WALTHer name is Daisy.

          scratches her belly.WALTYou take it easy, old gal. You
