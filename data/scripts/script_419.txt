FEAR & LOATHING IN LAS VEGASFEAR & LOATHING IN LAS VEGASby

              Terry Gilliam & Toy GrisoniBLACK SCREENA desert wind moans sadly.  From somewhere within the wind
comes the tinkly, syrupy-sweet sounds of the Lennon Sisters
singing "My Favorite Things." A series of sepia images of
anti-war protests from the mid-sixties appear one after
another on the screen.

In the violently scrawled style of Ralph Steadman, the title
FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS splashes onto the screen.  A
beat, and then it runs down and off revealing:

TITLE: "He who makes a beast of himself
       Gets rid of the pain
       Of being a man."
       Dr. Johnson

The VOICE OF HUNTER S. THOMPSON -- a.k.a. RAOUL DUKE:DUKE (V/O)We were somewhere around Barstow on
            the edge of the desert when the
            drugs began to take hold.AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!A red Chevy convertible -- THE RED SHARK -- wipes the black
screen.EXT. ON THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAYAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!THE RED SHARK races down the desert highway at a hundred
miles an hour.  THE STONES' "Sympathy For the Devil" blares.AT THE WHEELSTRANGELY STILL AND TENSE, RAOUL DUKE DRIVES -- SKELETAL,BEER IN HAND -- STARES STRAIGHT AHEAD.BESIDE HIM, FACE TURNED TO THE SUN, EYES CLOSED BEHINDWRAPAROUND SPANISH SUNGLASSES, IS HIS SWARTHY AND UNNERVINGLYUNPREDICTABLE ATTORNEY, DR. GONZO.The music pounds DUKE stares straight ahead.  GONZO froths
up a can of beer - uses it as shaving foam.DUKE (V/O)I remember saying something like:
            "I feel a bit lightheaded.  Maybe
            you should drive..."

GONZO starts shaving.2.DUKE (V/O)Suddenly there was a terrible roar
            all around us and the sky was full
            of what looked like huge bats, all
            swooping and screeching and diving
            around the car...

Close on DUKE -- shadows flutter across his face.  The
reflections of bats swirl within his eyes.  We push in close
to one eye ball -- SCREECHING SWIRLING BAT-LIKE SHAPES!AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!DUKE (V/O)... and a voice was screaming: Holy
            Jesus!  What are these goddamn
            animals?CUT TO WIDE SHOT OF CAR -DUKE, eyes rigid, flails at the air.  No bats anywhere.
GONZO casually looks over...GONZOWhat are you yelling about?

DUCK SCREECHES to the side of the road.  The sudden wrench
makes GONZO nick his face with his razor.DUKENever mind.  It's your turn to drive.DUKE (V/O)No point mentioning these bats.  I
            thought.  The poor bastard will see
            them soon enough.

DUKE hops out of the car, keeping an eye out for bats,
frantically opens the trunk to reveal what looks like A
MOBILE POLICE NARCOTICS LAB.  DUKE desperately rifles
through the impressive stash.DUKE (V/O)We had two bags of grass, seventy-
            five pellets of mescaline, five
            sheets of high powered blotter
            acid, a salt shaker half full of
            cocaine, a whole galaxy of multi-
            colored uppers, downers, screamers,
            laughers... Also a quart of tequila,
            a quart of rum, a case of beer, a
            pint of raw ether and two dozen
            amyls.3.DUKE, eyes darting madly as he hears what sounds like the
SHRIEKS OF BATS returning, grabs an assortment along with
another six-pack of beer - slams the trunk shut and dives
back into the car.DUKE (V/O)Not that we needed all that for the
            trip, but once you get locked into
            a serious drug collection, the
            tendency is to push it as far as
            you can.

THE RED SHARK RACES INTO THE DISTANCE... on the ground,
weakly flapping is a SEMI-SQUASHED, SLOWLY DYING ANIMAL... ABAT?EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAYIN THE RED SHARKGONZO grips the wheel - stares maniacally down the road - a
lousy driver.DUKE (V/O)The only thing that really worried
            me was the ether.  There is nothing
            in the world more helpless and
            irresponsible and depraved than a
            man in the depths of an ether binge.
            And I knew we'd get into that
            rotten stuff pretty soon.

The radio news wars with "SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL" on a tape
recorder.RADIO NEWSAn overdose of heroin was listed as
            the official cause of death for
            pretty 19 year old Diane Hanby
            whose body was found stuffed in a
            refrigerator last week...

GONZO changes the station - "ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE, SWEET
JESUS, ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE" vies with "SYMPATHY"... He
sings along - washes a couple of pills back with a new beer.
The RED SHARK fishtails.GONZO"One toke over the line, sweet
            Jesus."4.DUKE(muttering to himself)
            One toke.  You poor fool.  Wait
            till you see those goddamn bats.UP AHEAD - AT THE SIDE OF THE DESERTED ROADA LONE HITCHHIKER spots them, jumps up and sticks out a
thumb.  The RED SHARK roars past.  Then, fifty yards down
the road...GONZOLet's give that boy a lift.

GONZO wrenches the wheel - THE RED SHARK swerves to the side
of the road.DUKEWe can't stop here - this is bat
            country!

GONZO JAMS THE CAR INTO REVERSE AND ROCKETS BACKWARDS.  The
HITCHHIKER races to the car.  A poor OKIE KID with a big grin.HITCHHIKERHot damn!  I never rode in a
            convertible before!

Then the big grin freezes on the OKIE KID's face at the
sight of: DUKE and GONZO looking out at him with HYPER-
NORMAL, shit-eating SMILES.DUKEIs that right?  Well, I guess
            you're about ready, eh?

The HITCHHIKER hesitates.GONZOWe're your friends.  We're not like
            the others.DUKE(hissing sharply)
            No more of that talk or I'll put
            the leeches on you.

DUKE turns back to the HITCHHIKER - smiles reassuringly.EXT. EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAYThe HITCHHIKER sits nervously in the back seat as the RED
SHARK screams down the road.5.GONZO sings along to the tape player.

The HITCHHIKER's eyes go to the door - considers jumping out
and taking his chances.

DUKE, sweating bullets, STARES AT THE HITCHHIKER in the rear
view mirror.DUKE (V/O)How long could we maintain, I
            wondered.  How long before one of
            us starts raving and jabbering at
            this boy?  What will he think then?
            This same lonely desert was the
            last known home of the Manson family.

The HITCHHIKER's eyes notice a thin line of blood trickling
down GONZO's neck.DUKE (V/O)Would he make that grim connection
            when my attorney starts screaming
            about bats and huge manta rays
            coming down on the car?

DUKE's mouth moves intermittently - sometimes in sync with
the words, sometimes not.DUKE (V/O)If so - well, we'll just have to
            cut his head off and bury him
            somewhere.  Because it goes without
            saying that we can't turn him loose.
            He'd report us at once to some kind
            of outback Nazi law enforcement
            agency, and they'll run us down
            like dogs...DUKE(out loud to himself)
            Jesus!  Did I say that?DUKE (V/O)Or just think it?  Was I talking?
            Did they hear me?GONZO(reassuringly to HITCHHIKER)
            It's okay.  He's admiring the shape
            of your skull.

DUKE gives the HITCHHIKER a FINE BIG GRIN and the HITCHHIKER
giggles nervously.6.DUKE (V/O)Maybe I better have a chat with
            this boy I thought.  Perhaps if I
            explain things, he'll rest easy...DUKE(roaring over the
                   road noise)THERE'S ONE THING YOU SHOULDPROBABLY UNDERSTAND --The HITCHHIKER stares at him, not blinking.DUKE(yells)CAN YOU HEAR ME?The HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- terrified.  DUKE climbs
into the back seat.DUKEThat's good.  Because I want you to
            have all the background.  This is a
            very ominous assignment -- with
            overtones of extreme personal
            danger.  I'm a Doctor of Journalism!
            This is important, goddamnit!  This
            is a true story!...
                   (WHACKS the BACK OFTHE DRIVER'S SEATwith his fist)


The CAR SWERVES SICKENINGLY, then straightens out.GONZO(screams)
            Keep your hands off my fucking neck!

The HITCHHIKER makes a sudden lunge for freedom.  DUKE GRABSHIM BACK DOWN.DUKE (V/O)Our vibrations were getting nasty --
            but why?  Was there no communication
            in this car?  Had we deteriorated
            to the level of dumb beasts?

The HITCHHIKER STRUGGLES IN PANIC.7.DUKE(to HITCHHIKER)
            I want you to understand that this
            man at the wheel is my attorney!
            He's not just some dingbat I found
            on the Strip.  He's a foreigner.  I
            think he's probably Samoan.  But it
            doesn't matter, does it?  Are you
            prejudiced?HITCHHIKERHell, no!DUKEI didn't think so.  Because in
            spite of his race, this man is
            extremely valuable to me.  Hell, I
            forgot all about this beer.  You
            want one?
                   (HITCHHIKER shakes
                   his head)
            How about some ether?HITCHHIKERWhat?DUKENever mind.  Let's get right to the
            heart of this thing.  Twenty-four
            hours ago we were sitting in the
            Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills
            Hotel...INT. THE BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL POGO LOUNGE 1971 - DAYA uniformed DWARF, carries a shockingly PINK TELEPHONE
through the glittering, tranquil POGO LOUNGE CROWD.  They
are the ELOI.  HENDRIX AFROS and DROOPING MUSTACHES and BELL
BOTTOMS and LOVE BEADS and BELLS.  ACTRESSES sip Singapore
Slings and PROMOTERS sip ACTRESSES in this MONIED, SANITISEDVERSION OF THE GREAT REVOLUTION YEARS.DUKE (V/O)... in the patio section, of
            course, drinking Singapore Slings
            with mescal on the side, hiding
            from the brutish realities of this
            foul year of Our Lord, 1971.

The DWARF reaches DUKE -- T-shirt, levis, sneakers and
shades.  GONZO -- white rayon bellbottoms and a khaki tank
top undershirt.  They are in the middle of a serious
conversation.8.DUKEI'm telling you, the Salazar story
            is getting too complicated.  The
            weasels have started closing in.

The DWARF sneers.DWARFPerhaps this is the call you've
            been waiting for all this time,
            sir...

DUKE lifts the receiver -- listens...DUKEUh-huh... Uh-huh... Uh-huh...

DUKE hangs up the PHONE with the DEAD-PAN EXPRESSION OF AMOVIE SPY.DWARFThat was headquarters.  They want
            me to go to Las Vegas at once and
            make contact with a Portuguese
            photographer named Lacerda.  He'll
            have the details.  All I have to do
            is check into my sound proof suite
            and he'll seek me out.

GONZO, says nothing for a moment, then POUNDS the table!GONZOGod hell!  I think I see the
            pattern!  This one sounds like real
            trouble!  You're going to need
            plenty of legal advice before this
            thing is over.  As your attorney I
            must advise you that you'll need a
            very fast car with no top and after
            that, the cocaine.  And then the
            tape recorder, for special music,
            and some Acapulco shirts...

                   khaki undershirt into

            This blows my weekend, because
            naturally I'll have to go with
            you -- and we'll have to arm
            ourselves.9.DUKEWhy not?  If a thing's worth doing,
            it's worth doing right.

DUKE and GONZO are up and off.  The DWARF chases after them
with the (very large) check in his hand.

They sweep out through the Lounge door, unaware of it
swinging back into the face of the pursuing DWARF.DUKEI tell you, my man.  This is the
            American Dream in action!  We'd be
            fools not to ride this strange
            torpedo all the way to the end.GONZOIndeed.  We must do it.  What kind
            of story is this?EXT. BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL - FRONT ENTRANCE - DAYDUKE and GONZO emerge.DUKEThe Mint 400!  The richest off-road

up against the bathroom doorknob and puts the mace can next

collapses onto the sofa and lights up his lightbulb as pipe.DUKE (V/O)Ignore the nightmare in the bathroom.

            of peak that never comes again.
            San Francisco in the middle sixties
            was a very special time and place
            to be a part of.  But no
            explanation, no mix of words or
            music or memories can touch that
            sense of knowing that you were

            subconsciously waiting for the

            running somewhere between $29 and

            would play that song -- right now,
            at this moment?

DUKE opens his eyes and the hotel suite rushes in.  He lies,
awkwardly twisted -- unable to move.  He could have been
there days -- months.DUKE (V/O)When I came to the general back
            alley ambiance of the suite was so
            rotten, so incredibly foul.  How
            long had I been lying there?  Hours?
            Days?  Months?  All these signs of
            violence.  What had happened?

DUKE moves his eyes -- taking in his surroundings: Like THE
SIGHT OF SOME DISASTROUS ZOOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT involving
whisky and gorillas.  Blue and red Christmas tree lights
replace lightbulbs, used towels hanging everywhere,
pornographic pictures ripped out of a magazine are plastered
on a shattered mirror.DUKE (V/O)There was evidence in this room of
            excessive consumption of almost
            every type of drug known to
            civilized man since 1544 AD.

DUKE manages to move -- stiffly gets to his bare feet --
HOBBLES ROUND THE TRASHED ROOM like a newly risen ape.DUKE (V/O)But what kind of addict would need
            all these coconut husks and crushed
            honeydew rinds?  Would the presence
            of junkies account for all these
            uneaten french fries?  These
            puddles of glazed ketchup on the
            bureau?  Maybe so, but then why all
            this booze?  And these crude

DUKE looks into the room.  He sees GONZO's ass sticking out
of the closet.  He opens his mouth to speak when, IN THESMASHED MIRROR HE SEES THE FRAGMENTED REFLECTION OF HIMSELF...sleeping on the sofa.

The ominous SOUND OF A KEY TURNING in the room lock.

A hellish scream wakes up the SLEEPING DUKE.  He sees GONZO
grappling naked with the maid -- gun to her head.  GONZO is
muffling her screams with an ice bag.MAIDPlease... please... I'm only the

GONZO hustles the MAID to the door.MAIDYou'd pay me for that?DUKEYou're damn right.  But the first

She repeats the password several times while they listen to
make sure she has it right.GONZOOh, and don't bother to make up the

DUKE and GONZO burst out of the supermarket riding a shopping
basket loaded with COCONUTS, GRAPEFRUIT and TEQUILA.  They
send DEFEATED SHOPPERS sprawling.

The trolley collides into the WHITE WHALE.  SHOPPERS gather
at the supermarket entrance to watch -- baskets loaded with
junk, SCREAMING KIDS and EMPTY WALLETS.

DUKE switches on the music: JUMPING JACK FLASH.  He selects
a coconut -- ceremonially balances it on the hood.  GONZO
pulls out a silver claw-hammer.  A sly look at the gathering
CROWD... then he smashes the hammer down on the coconut!

A GASP from the surly SHOPPERS.

DUKE HITS THE BRAKES and wrenches the wheel -- takes the
WHALE down into the grassy freeway divider.  WHEELS CHURNING,
HE MAKES IT UP THE OPPOSITE BANK, nose of the car straight
up, then BOUNCES ONTO THE FREEWAY and keeps going right OVER
A FENCE, dragging it through a cactus field and onto theRUNWAY.GONZO is FROZEN WITH FEAR -- GRIPPING THE DASHBOARD.  He
throws a worried look at DUKE.DUKEI'll drop you right next to the
            plane.

They SPEED UNDER A PARKED AIRPLANE, SHOUTING ABOVE THE JETENGINE SCREAM.GONZONo!  I can't get out!  They'll
            crucify me.  I'll have to take the
            blame!106.DUKE(irritatedly)
            Ridiculous!  Just say you were
            hitchhiking to the airport and I
            picked you up.  You never saw me
            before.  Shit, this town is full of
            white Cadillac convertibles.  I
            plan to go through there so fast
            that nobody will even glimpse the
            goddamn license plate.  You ready?GONZOWhy not?  But for Christ's sake,
            just do it fast!EXT. AT THE AIRPLANE - DAYDUKE SCREECHES UP in front of the DESERT AIR 727.  GONZOJUMPS OUT -- HEADS FOR THE PLANE.DUKE watches him go -- RELENTS.DUKEHey!

GONZO stops -- turns.DUKEDon't take any guff from those
            swine.  Remember, if you have any
            trouble you can always send a
            telegram to the Right People.GONZOYeah... Explaining my Position.
            Some asshole wrote a poem about
            that once...

GONZO pauses.GONZOProbably good advice, if you have
            shit for brains.

GONZO turns and RACES TOWARDS THE STEPS JUST AS HE IS ABOUTTO ENTER THE PLANE HE PAUSES AND LOOKS BACK...SMILES...ANDLEANS FORWARD AND VOMITS.DUKE (V/O)There he goes -- one of God's own
            prototypes -- a high powered mutant
            of some kind never even considered
            for mass production.  Too weird to
            live and too rare to die.107.DUKE watches for a second then ROARS AWAY.  PULL BACK WITHTHE WHITE SHARK -- LEAVING THE AIRPLANE FAR BEHIND.INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE/APOCALYPSE - NIGHTOn the TV an airplane soars thru the sky.  Pull back to find
DUKE barricaded in GONZO'S BEDROOM.  He is typing on his
typewriter.DUKEWe are all wired into a survival
            trip now.  No more of the speed
            that fueled that 60's.  That was
            the fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip.
            He crashed around America selling
            "consciousness expansion" without
            ever giving a thought to the grim
            meat-hook realities that were lying
            in wait for all the people who took
            him seriously...

DUKE records like A WAR CORRESPONDENT.  The CAMERA slowly
rises -- DUKE alone in the room with the TV SPEWING OUTIMAGES OF WARS AND CIVIL UNREST OF THE 90'S.DUKEAll those pathetically eager acid
            freaks who thought they could buy
            Peace and Understanding for three
            bucks a hit.  But their loss and
            failure is ours too.  What Leary
            took down with him was the central
            illusion of a whole life-style that
            he helped create...RISING HIGHER -- THE WALLS OF THE ROOM APPEAR TO BY 20 TO 30FEET HIGH.  DUKE SEEMS TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF A WELL... THECAMERA RISES UP THROUGH BROKEN TIMBERS...DUKE... a generation of permanent
            cripples, failed seekers, who never
            understood the essential old-mystic
            fallacy of the Acid Culture: the
            desperate assumption that somebody...
            or at least some force -- is
            tending the light at the end of the
            tunnel.HIGHER STILL -- DUKE ALONE IN THE ROOM -- AN ISOLATED BOXSURROUNDED BY THE TWISTED METAL AND RUBBLE AND SMASHED NEONSIGNS OF THE DEAD CITY -- A BLASTED LANDSCAPE WITHOUTLIGHT -- SHARDS OF A CIVILIZATION.108.EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAYA BURNING FLARED-OUT SUN.  The camera pans down to DUKE
DRIVING THE WRECKED WHALE.  A piece of the fence flies out
of the back seat as he takes a bump.DUKE (V/O)There was only one road back to L.A.
            US Interstate 15, just a flat-out
            high speed burn through Baker and
            Barstow and Berdoo, then on to the
            Hollywood Freeway straight into
            frantic oblivion: safety, obscurity,
            just another freak in the Freak
            Kingdom.

DUKE sees THE HARDWARE BARN, A RUSTIC OLD FARM BUILDING
facing the road with a single gas pump outside and a neon
sign that flashes beer.DUKEAhhh.  Wonderful.

DUKE PULLS OFF THE ROAD and parks.  Gets out and walks in.INT. HARDWARE BARN - BAKER, CALIFORNIA - DAYDUKE enters the DARK, CLUTTERED INTERIOR.  Scattered all
about the store are BITS OF AMERICANA... OLD BARRELS, WAGONWHEELS, WOODEN YOKES.  A STUFFED HORSE HANGS FROM THERAFTERS.  The sunlight shafts through high windows.  AN OLD
MAN is repairing an iron pot-bellied stove near the wooden
bar.  A NORMAN ROCKWELL PAINTING... ONLY REAL.PROPRIETORWhat'll you have?

DUKE can't quite believe this place -- too good to be true.DUKE(doubtfully)
            Ballantine Ale...?

THE PROPRIETOR serves the ale up ice cold.  DUKE SMILES ANDRELAXES.DUKEHard to find it served like this
            anymore.

As he drinks, DUKE toys with a rack of key chains -- LITTLEAMERICAN ICONS... A REMINGTON COWBOY, A BUGS BUNNY, A TWEETYPIE, BETTY BOOP, A BASEBALL PLAYER.  The logo on the rack
reads: AMERICAN DREAM KEY RINGS.109.PROPRIETORWhere ya comin' from, young man?DUKELas Vegas.PROPRIETORA great town, that Vegas.  I bet
            you had good luck there.  You're
            the type.DUKEI know.  I'm a triple Scorpio.PROPRIETOR(trustingly)
            That's a fine combination.  You
            can't lose.

A LOVELY GIRL appears.  Seeing DUKE, she smiles.  CAN THIS
REALLY BE HIS LUCKY DAY?  She approaches him... and...KISSES THE PROPRIETOR.DUKE(caught off guard... muttering)
            Oh, my God!...PROPRIETOR(not understanding)
            This is my granddaughter...DUKE(recovering)
            Don't worry...
                   (leans forward in confidence)
            ... and I'm actually the District
            Attorney from Ignoto County.
                   (winks)
            Just another good American like
            yourself.A MOMENT.  THE PROPRIETOR'S SMILE DISAPPEARS.Wordlessly the PROPRIETOR and his GRANDDAUGHTER go to the
back of the store -- GET ON WITH THEIR WORK -- IGNORING DUKE.WHO FEELS ASHAMED.DUKE puts some money down on the bar and SLOWLY LEAVES.EXT. HARDWARE BARN - DAYA CHASTENED DUKE approaches the vomit streaked WHITE WHALE.
Gets in -- sits there -- deflated -- miserable...110.A state bus draws up across from the Hardware Barn.

Somberly, DUKE watches as TWO YOUNG MARINES with duffel bags
step off -- chatting like TRUE BROTHERS...

DUKE switches on the ignition.  Something rolls off the
trembling dash... DUKE catches it...ONE SINGLE BEAUTIFUL AMYL CAPSULE...DUKE CRACKS THE AMYL -- INHALES.  THE RUSH MAKES HIM GASP --TEETH BARED LIKE A MADMAN.DUKEHOLY SHIT!!!DUKE GUNS THE ENGINE with a laugh -- leans out -- YELLS ATTHE MARINES.DUKEGOD'S MERCY ON YOU SWINE!DUKE ROARS AWAY.  AN AMERICAN FLAG FLIES UP FROM THE DEBRISIN THE BACK SEAT, MADLY UNFURLING ITSELF AS IT SNAGS ON THECONVERTIBLE-TOP FRAME OF THE TRASHED WHITE WHALE!AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!The TWO MARINES look after him CONFUSED.EXT. DESERT HIGHWAYDUKE drives fast -- TEETH GRITTED IN FROZEN ECSTASY!!DUKE CRANKS UP THE TAPE RECORDER.DUKE (V/O)My heart was filled with joy.  I
            felt like a monster reincarnation
            of Horatio Alger... a man on the
            move... and just sick enough to be
            totally confident.
