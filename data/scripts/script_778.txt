                              Nick GutheCLOSE ON:The face of MINERVA "MINI" DROGUES, 18, watching something.
          She looks extremely bored by the television images flickering
          across her eyes. She has a pretty face: Large eyes, and pouty
          mouth. Her knowing look is incongruous with a face clearly
          still that of a girl.-                    MINI (V.O.)I know what you're thinking. Don't
                    bullshit me, because I do... You're
          -         thinking, oh dear lord in heaven,
                    please, I'm begging you. I'll gouge
          -         out my eyes with the straw in my
                    drink right now. I'll jam every
                    last kernel of popcorn into my
          -         mouth until I suffocate, just not
                    another fucking teenage coming-of-
                    age story.We pull back to reveal her body, which is moving out of that
          awkward stage between adolescence and womanhood. Though tall
          and thin, her hips haven't quite rounded. She's wearing a
          "FUCT" T-shirt and jean shorts.MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)Well, relax...no prom night
                    highjinks, no nerds becoming
                    popular and no Shakespeare set in
                    high school...I promise.

          CLOSE ON: THE TV SCREEN. "When Animals Attack" is on. In a
          series of quick cuts:A zoo keeper is mauled by an elephant.A sport fisherman is attacked on the deck of a boat by a
          shark he and his buddies thought was dead.

           A pit bull clamps down on his owner's arm.An alligator hunter stupidly puts his head in the mouth of a
          just-captured alligator, only to have it chomp down on his
          skull.MINI (V.O.)Since it happened, everyone's
                    asked me how it all started.2.Mini's face registers no reaction to the gruesome images. We
          now see she is sitting in the living room of a well-appointed
          Studio City hillside home.INT. THE LIVING ROOM- EVENING- A PARTY.TEENAGERS OF PRIVILEGE and their UPTIGHT PARENTS are milling
          around, dancing and chatting as A DEEJAY spins tunes.MINI (V.O.)I suppose the obvious answer is my
                    eighteenth birthday...Mini dances with a few friends in a very short mini-skirt and
          halter top. She clearly understands how to the drive the boys
          crazy and this is not lost on her mother, DIANE, 42, who
          stands off to the side, nursing a drink with some other HYPER-AEROBICIZED MOTHERS.MINI (V.O.)See, I was blessed with a terrific
                    mom. Not only is she a lush, but
                    she also hates me.Diane is beautiful, but there is an essential hardness to her
          that comes from a life spent trading on her looks. The
          blouse and mini-skirt she wears are inappropriately revealing
          for the occasion of her daughter's birthday.MINI (V.O.)A few days before the party, I
                    overhear her on the phone ordering
                    me a male stripper. Nothing says "I
                    love you" like ten inches of man
                    meat in your face.Diane and the other mothers are talking about Mini's dancing.MINI (V.O.)And knowing dear old ma, she'll try
                    and nail him after the party...in
                    my bed.Mini's friend KAYLA, a little rounder, but also brash, comes
          dancing over. She's swaying her hips provocatively at Mini,
          almost challenging her.MIKE RUDELL, a tanned and trim man of 55, watches their
          display, clearly enjoying the way it's jump-starting his
          imagination.(CONTINUED)3.CONTINUED:MINI (V.O.)That guy? Our neighbor Mike Rudell,
                       big shot TV producer and the guy my
                       mom screws whenever the batteries
                       run out.Kayla and Mini begin dancing together in a very explicit way,
          clearly trying to make the adults uncomfortable.MINIYo, bee-ach!KAYLAYo, birthday bee-ach!MINIIs it on?KAYLAOh, it's on!MINIThat's my girl!Mini grabs Kayla and dips her low.INT. THE KITCHEN - LATER.Kayla instructs some CATERERS to start wheeling a giant
          birthday cake into the living room. The caterers look
          confused, but Kayla is insistent and the young men obey,
          starting to wheel the cake down the long hall.INT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUSThe cake emerges from the hallway. The caterers begin singing
          "Happy Birthday", as Diane turns to see it and her eyes flash
          rage. As Diane comes storming over, we switch to SLOW MOTION.MINI (V.O.)See, to understand me, you need to
                       understand that life, in my
                       opinion, is all about new
                       experiences. "Firsts" is what I
                       call them.As she strides across the room, the look of vitriolic rage on
          Diane's face grows stronger with every step.(CONTINUED)4.CONTINUED:MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)Somewhere around fourteen, when I
                       had my first...rhymes with duck, I
                       realized that the goal of life, any
                       life, should be to cram as many
                       "firsts" into it as possible.We switch back to real time.DIANEWhat the hell are you doing? I said
                       wait until-
                           (looking around)
                       She's not even here, you morons!A YOUNG CATERER'S face turns white.CATERERBut, but her friend said--POP! Suddenly the lid to the cake flies off and from behind
          we see A NUDE MINI rises out of it like Venus on the half
          shell.MINISURPRISE!MINI'S POV:A collection of reactions from the party goers: The mothers
          are numb, the fathers pretend to be disturbed, while copping
          looks, and her friends are in stitches. Some are even waving
          dollar bills.        MMINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)That was definitely a first, but
                       more importantly, it was the first
                       time I really understood my
                       potential...And that's when it all
                       started.Mini leans over and gives her STUNNED mom a big hug.MINI (CONT'D)(doing her best Donna
                             Reed)
                       Oh, Mom, this is the best birthday
                       ever!5.INT. MINI'S BATHROOM - NIGHTMini stands in a bathrobe with a towel around her head,
          having just taken a shower. She removes the towel to reveal
          she's just changed her hair color to FLAMING RED.MINI (V.O.)That little stunt got me grounded
                    for a week, but it was worth it.CUT TO:Mini blow drying her hair.MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)See, I just don't understand people
                    who live their lives as one big
                    routine.CUT TO:Mini evenly spreading the base to her make-up.MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)They're basically saying "I'm not
                    worthy of a unique experience on
                    this earth."...Well, sorry, but I
                    am.CUT TO:Mini applying blush to her cheeks.MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)The law of firsts has served me
                    well, because it's liberated me
                    from the usual pathetic, repetitive
                    concerns of high school.CUT TO:Mini applying eye liner.MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)I simply don't care if I'm popular,
                    because if I did, then I'd be
                    constantly stressing about whether
                    my clothes are cool enough, or if
                    Troy, the "gay but he doesn't know
                    it yet" quarterback, is gonna call.6.INT. THE HALLWAY OF MINI'S HIGH SCHOOL - DAYMini and Kayla walk down the crowded halls attracting lustful
          looks from some of the more aggressive boys.They approach a group of FOOTBALL PLAYERS.KAYLA(whispering, worried)

                    him.TROY, a cocky, chiseled, all-around nightmare, sticks his
          tongue in his cheek, simulating a blow job.TROYYo, Kayla, I got some more of what
                    you were looking for Saturday
                    night.MINI (V.O.)Ahh...The joys of the American
                    educational system.Kayla puts her head down, her face turning red, as Mini stops
          to address Troy and his posse.MINI (CONT'D)(suddenly brightening)
                    Actually, Troy, I think you
                    confused her with that senile,
                    toothless grandmother of yours."Ooohs" and "Aaahs" erupt from the onlookers as Troy looks
          concerned his ambush has backfired.TROYYo, Mini, why don't you use that
                    mouth for something useful and suck
                    my dick?More students start to gather, overhearing them.MINIActually, now that you mention it,
                    I can't think of anything I'd
                    rather do than suck your dick.(CONTINUED)7.CONTINUED:Troy looks around, surprised and emboldened by her
          declaration.TROYWell, it's all for you, babe.Mini moves closer, looking him right in the eye.MINIReally?TROY(daring her)
                       If you can fit it all in.The crowd has now swelled to a few dozen, as everyone is
          riveted by the exchange. Suddenly, Mini starts unzipping his
          fly.TROY (CONT'D)Hey, what the?!MINI(grabbing his belt buckle)
                       I'm going to suck your dick, Troy,
                       you said I could.Troy tries to push her away, but she's got a grip on his
          belt. Everyone watching is almost speechless at first, but
          then giggles start to erupt.TROYYo, this ain't funny!MININo, Troy, I want to suck your dick
                       right now!TROYJesus, Mini, come on, get off!MINI(screaming)

                       come on!She gets down on her knees, struggling to get a hand in his
          pants. The crowd howls with approval, as they almost can't
          believe their eyes.(CONTINUED)8.CONTINUED: (2)MINILet's see it! Come on, I want to

                    when she was twenty to become an
                    actress. Even though she was a
                    total flatliner, somehow she
                    managed to land a few bit parts on
                    soaps...without screwing anyone.INT. A HALLWAY OF THE HOUSE - LATER.Mini walks along the corridor in a pair of "fuck me" pumps,
          as the doorbell is heard ringing.MINI (V.O.)When she gets really sauced, she'll
                    pop the tapes in and make me watch,
                    then I'll threaten to call the
                    suicide hotline.She continues through the living room towards the door,
          hiking her mini skirt up a little.MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)After a few years, she got
                    desperate and spread 'em for this
                    fat, ugly producer when he promised
                    to give her a role in some bullshit
                    cable series that was basically
                    softcore porn. She got knocked up
                    with me and he told her she
                    couldn't be on the show, unless she

          on to the counter.MINI (V.O.)She was gonna do it, too, at least
                    that what's she told me when she
                    was feeling particularly loving.
                    But then she heard rumors the show
                    wasn't gonna fly and realized
                    eighteen years of child support
                    beat thirteen weeks on "Skin
                    Tight", so I got to stick around.
                    ...Bad choice.Mini opens one case, takes out a bottle and heads out of the
          kitchen.INT. THE WET BAR - LATER.Mini mixes herself a large Sapphire martini.MINI (V.O.)Anyway, what Mom didn't count on
                    was the prick having a heart attack
                    and croaking a year after I was
                    born.She pours it into a martini glass and drops an olive in.MINI (V.O.)When she tried to collect on his
                    estate, she found out he'd owed the
                    government two point five in back
                    taxes.EXT. A RUN DOWN STUCCO APARTMENT BUILDING IN THE VALLEY-CIRCA 1993.Diane walks down the steps to a waiting Porsche, with a

                       would've set her sights a little
                       lower and gone after a guy who
                       would've worshipped the ground she
                       walked on and wouldn't care that
                       she already had a kid...CUT TO:Diane getting into the car. She turns to the driver and gives
          him a flirty smile. IT'S NOW A DIFFERENT, but just as SLEAZY
          GUY smiling back at her.MINI (V.O.)But not mom, she was gonna bag

          #3's brains out waft through the thin walls.13.INT. THE KITCHEN OF DIANE'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING.Mini sits at the kitchen table eating cereal as THE FOURTH
          SLEAZY GUY emerges from Diane's bedroom, he's tucking his
          shirt in. He looks a little startled to see her up.SLEAZY GUY #4Oh...Uh, hi, uh, tell your mom I, uh, had a good time.MINIOh, I will...Like some coffee for

          him.INT. DIANE'S APARTMENT - LATER.Diane emerges from her bedroom in her bathrobe, looking
          disheveled. She glares at Mini, who sits at the kitchen

                    hole your whole life?Mini just stares at her.DIANEThen stay in your fucking room
                    until they leave. Got it?Mini says nothing. Suddenly, Diane picks up a SMALL PIECE OF
          POTTERY from the coffee table and throws it at Mini's head.
          Mini ducks as it SMASHES behind her on the wall.14.CUT BACK TO: 18 YEAR OLD MINI MIXING HER MARTINI IN THE WETBAR.MINI (V.O.)So it pretty much went on like that
                    until...MALE VOICE (O.S.)Mini? Diane? I'm home.MINI (V.O.)Five years ago, when she met

          looks back, as it runs after her, grabbing her by the

          VOLANT, an impeccably dressed operator with a mane of thick,
          heavily gelled hair. Garson sits across from them.GARSONThere's a small discrepancy that I
                    can't quite figure out and I was
                    hoping you might be able to explain
                    it.MARTINI suppose I can try.(CONTINUED)102.CONTINUED:GARSONThe final toxicology report came
                       back and your wife definitely
                       didn't die from the pills. She
                       wasn't conscious past 9:30, but it
                       was the fumes that killed her.MARTINWell, hallelujah, thanks for the
                       update-VOLANTMartin, easy.MARTINI'm sorry, but this is harassment.GARSONSee, here's what I needed to ask
                       you. The gas tank in the Jag was
                       almost full, just a gallon had been
                       used.MARTINAnd?GARSONWell, if she was unconscious by
                       9:30, that means the car must have
                       been running for at least two hours
                       when you found her. An unconscious
                       person can't turn on a car, right?VOLANTDetective, with all due respect,
                       could you get to the point?GARSONWell, here's where I get confused,
                       see, that particular model idling
                       for two hours will burn at least
                       four gallons of gas.Martin tries to remain calm, as the panic starts to settle in
          for a long stay.GARSONSo, there's really no way the tank
                       could be almost full if it was
                       running for two hours. Is there?He looks at Martin, waiting for an answer.(CONTINUED)103.CONTINUED: (2)GARSONSo, I guess what I'm asking is,
                    whose idea was it to put her in the
                    car?VOLANTMartin, don't say anything.GARSONNow, Mr. Tannen, you clearly had
                    the most to gain from her death,
                    but I've learned from a number of
                    your wife's friends that she and
                    Mini had a strained relationship.VOLANTAgain, Detective, my client won't
                    be answering anything, so let's
                    just cut the cat and mouse.GARSONI'd like Mr. Tannen to know that if
                    he's trying to be a protective
                    father by covering up something
                    Mini did, I'd be careful. The
                    district attorney is viewing this
                    case as an opportunity to show the
                    public that the rich don't get away
                    with murder in this town.Martin whispers something in Volant's ear and he in turn,Vwhispers back.OLANTDoes this mean he's offering Mr.
                    Tannen immunity if he says he was
                    protecting his daughter?Garson takes a sip of water, as Martin anxiously waits for
          his answer.GARSONIt's a strong possibility. But he
                    wants Mr. Tannen to know he will go
                    for the maximum sentence if he
                    doesn't. No manslaughter, no plea
                    bargains, nothing.Martin's eyes shift slightly.104.INT. ANOTHER INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUSGarson, now finished with Martin, sits across from Mini and
          her lawyer, HERB PELHAM, who doesn't look nearly as confident
          as Martin's lawyer.MINIIt was Colonel Mustard in the
                    library with the candlestick.Garson smiles at Mini, admiring her resolve.PELHAM(nervously)

          roll down her chin.MINI...my tongue.Even Garson appears a little intimidated by the overt
          flirtation.GARSONLook, the fact that the marriage
                    was unhappy and there was no pre-
                    nup gives all the motive to Martin.MINISo you want me to say it was his
                    idea?GARSONIf it was his idea, give me one
                    reason you should take the fall?MINI (V.O.)At that moment I knew we had him.
                    If he was trying to get me to rat
                    on Martin, he didn't have enough to
                    charge either one of us.(CONTINUED)105.CONTINUED:MINISo if I tell the jury it was his

          Mini stares into Garson's eyes, unflinching. She looks around
          the room, weighing her options. Pelham attempts to whisper
          something in her ear. She waves him off.MINISorry, sport, but I'll take my
