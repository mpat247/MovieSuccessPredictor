          A BEDSIDE LAMP is turned on.INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHTNORMA LEWIS ( 31) sits up in bed. The soft glow of the lamp
           casts her in silhouette. Her husband, ARTHUR LEWIS (30), lies
          next to her.NORMADid you hear something?ARTHURThe doorbell.NORMAAre you sure that was the doorbell?
          From down below... the DOORBELL rings again.ARTHURYep.
          Norma retrieves her WATCH from the bedside table.ARTHUR (CONT'D)What time is it?NORMAQuarter 'til five.
          Norma gets out of bed and throws on her bathrobe.
          Arthur sits up, hair sticking up in every direction. He has
          sideburns that run down the side of his face like daggers.INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FOYER -- NEXTNorma comes down the stairs and approaches the front door.
          She looks through the PEEPHOLE.
          Through the PEEPHOLE... she glimpses a BLACK SEDAN idling in
          the street. It quickly drives off.
          Norma unlatches the DEAD BOLT and opens the door. She notices
          something at her feet.2.Someone has left a CARDBOARD BOX on the front step. It's
          dimensions are 1' x 1' x 1'
          She leans down and picks up the box, noticing that it has
          been meticulously sealed with clear tape. There are no
          markings on it whatsoever.
          Norma looks down the quiet, empty street. She quickly closes
          the door and turns inside and away from the cold air.
          Arthur arrives at the bottom of the stairs.ARTHURWhat is it?NORMASomeone left a box.ARTHURWho?NORMAI don't know. There was a car
          waiting... but they drove off.
          Norma hands the box to Arthur. He examines it.MALE VOICE (O.S.)Is that one of my Christmas
          presents?
          Their young son, WALTER LEWIS ( 9), is standing at the top of
          the stairs. He is dressed in his pajamas.
          His parents just stare back at him in silence.INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATERThe Lewis family has now moved into the kitchen. WRAPPING
          PAPER and CHRISTMAS ORNAMENTS are scattered across the table.
          Norma is pouring COFFEE. Arthur is cutting through the tape
          that seals the box with a knife while Walter looks on
          eagerly.WALTERShould I close my eyes?ARTHURMaybe... it's up to you.
          Arthur opens the lid and sees that there are FOAM PEANUTS
          inside. He digs down and retrieves a WOODEN BOX. Its
          dimensions are 8" x 8" x 8".3.The box is made of WHITE OAK with a clear varnish. Mounted on
          top is a CLEAR GLASS DOME attached to a lid with a HINGE
          MOUNT. Inside of the dome is a CYLINDRICAL METAL BUTTON.NORMAIs there a note?
          Arthur reaches inside the box and retrieves a small WHITE
          ENVELOPE. Printed on the envelope in CALLIGRAPHY is the name:MRS. LEWISARTHURIt's for you, Norma.
          Norma opens the envelope and removes a folded piece of white
          stationary.
          Printed in elegant calligraphy is a single sentence:MR. STEWARD WILL CALL UPON YOU AT 5:00 PM.NORMAMr. Steward will call upon you at 5PM.(TO HERSELF)Do I know a Mr. Steward?
          Arthur yawns.ARTHURI dunno. You tell us.INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- LATER THAT MORNINGArthur is now showered and shaven, dressed for work. He and
          Walter sit at the kitchen table, waiting for Norma to deliver
          breakfast.
          The box sits on the table between them.

          She hands him his LUNCH BOX and a WINTER HAT. SNOW has begun
          to fall from the sky.WALTERLast day of school and now it
          starts to snow?!NORMAPut on your hat...
          A young girl, DANA ( 13) is waiting at the end of the
           sidewalk. She is wrapped head-to-toe in warm clothes...
          EARMUFFS and SCARF around her neck.DANA(muffled through scarf)
          Hi Mrs. Lewis.NORMAGood morning, Dana.(SHIVERING)And please call me Norma. You're
          making me feel old.WALTERYou are old!NORMAI'm thirty-one!WALTERTo us that's old! You're a geezer!NORMAWell you'll be a geezer one day
          too, smarty-pants.5.Norma closes her eyes, taking in a breath of cold air.
          Snowflakes land in her face and hair.
          Walter sighs... looking at his watch.WALTERWhy does the bus stop have to be at
          the end of our driveway?NORMA(HIGH-PITCHED)So I can watch my little Walter get
          on his bus... safe in one piece!
          Down the street, A SCHOOL BUS begins to crest the hill...
          fast approaching...WALTERPlease. Go. Inside. You're
          embarrassing me.NORMAMy love embarrasses you?WALTERYes. Yes it does.
          She begins to walk down the sidewalk... taunting him as the
          bus approaches.NORMAWhat if I give little Walter a
          little kiss in front of all his
          friends on the school bus?
          Dana's eyes widen. A MISCHIEVOUS GRIN emerges from behind the
          scarf that covers the lower part of her face.DANADo it!
          The bus is fast approaching... brakes squealing as it slows
          to a stop.WALTERDon't come any closer!
          Norma gives him a big HUG and a KISS right as the bus doors
          open. A bunch of OLDER KIDS stare out the window... scowling
          at him.
          Walter pushes away from her and stomps up onto the bus...
          mortified. Dana follows him.6.NORMADana... you're baby-sitting for us
          tonight, right?DANAEight o'clock?NORMAEight o'clock.DANAOkay.
          Dana gets on the bus. BUD WALL (30s), the bus driver, smiles
          at Norma. He is an enormous giant of a man with a shaved
          head.NORMABus-Driver Bud! Merry Christmas...BUDOur last day!NORMALI know!BUDIt'll all be over soon, Norma.
          He stares at her for a moment that is almost too long... then
          shuts the doors to the bus.INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATERArthur sits at the table... reading the morning paper.
          The CAMERA zooms into the COMICS SECTION... revealing the

          She grabs the ball in mid bounce... annoyed with him.NORMANot in the house!ARTHURHow's your foot?NORMAIt's fine.
          She pushes him toward into the FAMILY ROOM... opening the
          door that leads out to the garage.
          They exit the house and the CAMERA drifts back toward the
          kitchen table... moving in toward the box.EXT. LEWIS HOUSE -- DRIVEWAY -- MOMENTS LATERThe GARAGE DOOR opens and both of the LEWIS FAMILY CARS back
           out at the same time, almost choreographed in perfect unison.
           Arthur drives a SILVER 1975 PONTIAC TRANS-AM. Norma drives a
          WHITE 1976 OLDSMOBILE STATION WAGON with WOOD WALLS.
          They pull out onto MONUMENT AVENUE, cars pointing in opposite
          directions. Arthur rolls down his window.ARTHURIt's your Christmas present.NORMAFrom you?B.ARTHURFrom your secret lover.(BEAT)Mr. Steward.

          almost finished.
          He smiles... then peels off down Monument Ave.
          From Norma's REAR VIEW MIRROR... Arthur's car disappears down
          the road. She reaches up to re-adjust... her eyes appear in
          the mirror's reflection.

          She WINKS at someone... then turns a corner and the CAMERA
          whips around to reveal WALTER standing at his locker. He
           closes the door, revealing Dana and another friend named
          CHARLES ( 12) standing there.DANAWhy does your mom limp?CHARLESYeah... is something wrong with her
          foot?WALTERThat's none of your business.CHARLESDana saw her take her shoe off in

          Norma moves toward a stack of METAL TRAYS on her desk. Inside
          of each tray is a BALL OF BLACK MUSH.NORMA (CONT-D)Today is the day many of you have
          been eagerly awaiting. You get to
          dissect owl pellets.
          A MALE STUDENT ( 13) pumps his fist...MALE STUDENT #1Yes!
          Norma sets an OWL PELLET down in front of a FEMALE STUDENT
          ( 12). She looks at the owl pellet in disgust.FEMALE STUDENT #1This is so gross.
          Norma sets a tray down in front of Charles.12.CHARLESWhy do they call it an owl pellet?
          A MALE STUDENT ( 12) next to him takes his tray from Norma.MALE STUDENT #2Because they shit out of their
          mouths.NORMAHey... watch the language. You say

          The classroom gasps in disgust... others laugh.NORMA (CONT-D)Grey forest owls feed upon field
          mice, squirrels and small birds.
          The owl will then regurgitate the
          bones and waste matter in a ball of
          black mucous. Inside this mucous
          you will likely find the entire
          skeleton of its prey.
          Norma goes to the front of the room and lowers a SCREEN.NORMA (CONT-D)I'm going to show you a film about
          the digestive process of the owl,
          and how the owl pellet is formed.
          The classroom whispers with excitement.EXT. NASA LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER -- ENTRANCE GATE -- MORNINGArthur pulls through the ENTRANCE GATE at the NASA LANGLEY
          RESEARCH CENTER. He retrieves his BADGE from the dashboard
          and shows it to the guard.13.EXT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- MAIN STREET -- MOMENTS LATERArthur's car drives down MAIN STREET on the campus of the
          research center. The buildings are predominately drab,
          functional, one story brick structures.. surrounded by
          various GLOBE STRUCTURES and PIPE NETWORKS on manicured green
          lawns.INT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- CORRIDOR -- MOMENTS LATERThe CAMERA tracks with Arthur as he moves through the crowded
          corridor of one of the research buildings. He says hello to
          various colleagues along the way.
          All of the men at the facility are dressed the same... with
          white shirts and TIES and POCKET PROTECTOR BADGES. The place
          resembles an all-male community college for young scientists.INT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- MEDIA ROOM -- MOMENTS LATERArthur eases his way into the small, crowded AUDITORIUM that
          serves as a MEDIA ROOM. A PRESS CONFERENCE is underway.
          NORM CAHILL ( 40s), the VIKING PROJECT COORDINATOR, is
           standing at the podium. Next to him is an OVERHEAD PROJECTOR
          with maps and various schematics projected from it onto aLARGE SCREEN.REPORTER #1It's been five months since the
          Viking lander touched down on the
          surface of Mars. We've seen dozens
          of photographs of the rock covered
          surface... what can you now tell us
          about the tests you've been
          conducting? Is there any sign of
          life on the red planet?
          Arthur takes a seat in the back of the auditorium.CAHILLWell... there are three separate
          tests that we've been conducting...
          Pyrolytic Release, Labeled Release
          and Gas Exchange. The first two
          tests, based on soil samples about
          22 centimeters deep, came back
          negative... and the third is...
          still pending.
          Cahill smiles. Laughter erupts from various parts of the
          auditorium.14.REPORTER #1Can you elaborate on test number
          three?
          Cahill places a transparent MAP of the mars surface on the
          overhead projector and begins to draw on it with a WAXPENCIL.CAHILLThe gas exchange experiment
          measures the production or uptake
          of C02, nitrogen, methane,
          hydrogen, and oxygen during the
          incubation of the martian soil
          sample.REPORTER #2Are you showing us all of the
          photos? Are there little green men
          up there?
          Laughter from the press.CAHILLWell... there is a possibility that
          the planet abounds with chemical
          compounds produced by living
          systems. Their chemical nature,
          distribution and structural
          uniqueness could be used to argue
          the presence of microscopic living
          organisms on Mars.
          As Cahill moves on to the next question... Arthur taps the
          reporter on the shoulder.ARTHURIt all comes down to water.
          Arthur points to an OVERHEAD SATELLITE PHOTO of Utopia
          Planitia, a raised level of martian terrain in the vicinity
          of the site where VIKING II landed.
          There are dry river-bed formations in the soil.ARTHUR (CONT-D)If we find water beneath the
          surface... and the topographic maps
          of Utopia Planitia indicate that
          there were once rivers on the
          surface of the planet, it's
          possible that we'll eventually find
          evidence of life.15.INT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- SCIENCE LAB -- MOMENTS LATERThe OWL PELLET FILM is underway. Norma sits in the back of
          the class next to the projector. She crosses her legs...
          reaching for her foot... massaging it gently. She cringes...
          clearly in intense pain.
          Charles looks back at her... noticing this. They make eye
          contact... and Charles turns back to the screen.INT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- CAHILL'S OFFICE -- MORNINGArthur now sits across from Cahill in his office. Behind him
          is a window that overlooks a huge laboratory.CAHILLI'm sorry Arthur, but they've
          denied your application to be
          admitted into the astronaut
          program.
          Arthur looks crushed.ARTHURI see.(BEAT)Can I ask why?CAHILLI'm sorry, son... but they don't
          tell us why.INT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- LABORATORY -- LATER ONThe CAMERA tracks through a LARGE LABORATORY in the heart of
          one of the main buildings on the Langley campus.
          Work tables assembled with LABORATORY EQUIPMENT and MACHINERY
          extend out into infinity as DOZENS OF YOUNG MEN, all dressed
          in similar white shirts with NASA ID BADGES move throughout,
          engaged in various tasks.
          Arthur is standing at a LABORATORY TABLE with a WHITE MASK
          on. He is wearing a LAB COAT and GLASSES.
          He pours PINK LIQUID onto the surface of a METAL PAN...
          filling it to the edges.
          A colleague named WENDELL JAMES ( 29) walks over to see what
          he is doing.16.ARTHURAre they really with-holding some
          of the Mars photos?WENDELLI don't know, man. Jesus... what's
          that smell?ARTHURIt's a salinic compound.WENDELLWhat are you making?ARTHURChristmas present for Norma.
          Arthur retrieves a WHITE CERAMIC MOLD. The mold has an
          extrusion that is shaped like a WOMAN'S FOOT... only the end
          of the foot is round and missing its toes, save for the PINKYTOE.WENDELLA new prosthesis for her foot?ARTHURYep.
          Arthur carefully impresses the MOLD of his wife's foot into
          the pink goop... sealing the mold at the edges into the tray.WENDELLWhat did you change up this time?ARTHURThe compound they're developing for

          Her eyes light up, as she remembers the name and the box.
          Arlington then rotates his body... revealing the RIGHT SIDE
          of his face. Norma's eyes widen in horror at what she sees.
          Nearly all of the right side of his face from his cheekbone
          to his lower jaw has been burned away. His rear MOLARS and
          GUMS are exposed beneath the absence of tissue that is
          supposed to conceal them.
          Norma immediately feels a strange connection... a deep
          sympathy for him and the pain he must have endured.ARLINGTON (CONT-D)I assume you received the box that
          I left on your doorstep.
          His speech has a slight impediment from the burn that extends
          to the right side of his mouth.NORMAOh, yes. Yes we did.ARLINGTONAnd you retrieved the button unit
          inside of the box.
          Norma smiles. He smiles back at her.23.NORMAThe button unit. That's what you
          call it?ARLINGTONIndeed. May I come in?NORMASure.

          offer to make.NORMAYeah? What are you selling?ARLINGTONA financial opportunity.
          Arlington gestures toward the table with his briefcase.ARLINGTON (CONT'D)May I?
          She nods. He places the briefcase down on the table.
          He takes the button unit from her and sets it down on the
          kitchen table. They both sit down.
          He then withdraws a SMALL YELLOW ENVELOPE from his suit
          jacket pocket.ARLINGTON (CONT'D)inside of this envelope is a key.
          Arlington opens the envelope and withdraws a small METAL KEY.ARLINGTON (CONT'D)This is the key that opens the
          glass dome of the button unit.
          Arlington then inserts the key into a small HORIZONTAL SLOT
          at the top edge. He turns the key, and the LID that houses
          the GLASS DOME pops lose.
          The METAL BUTTON is now exposed.24.ARLINGTON (CONT'D)If you push the button, one of two

          two-hundred thousand dollars... tax
          free.
          Arlington opens the briefcase. Inside are neatly stacked rows
          of ONE-HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.ARLINGTON (CONT'D)The money will be delivered to you
          in cash.
          Norma covers her mouth... shocked at the sight of so much
          money.NORMAAre you for real?
          Arlington smiles back at her.ARLINGTONMrs. Lewis, I can assure you that
          the offer is real.NORMAWho do you work for?ARLINGTONThe guarantee of payment has
          several restrictions. One... I am

          will not receive the money in
          return for having pushed the
          button.(BEAT)Three... you have twenty four
          hours.
          Arlington glances at his watch.25.ARLINGTON (CONT'D)You have until five o'clock
          tomorrow evening to make your
          decision whether or not to push the
          button. At that time, I will return

          you. It will be re-programmed and
          the offer will be made to someone
          else.
          Arlington places the key back into the envelope, seals it
          with crisp precision, and hands it over to her.
          He then closes the briefcase and stands up to leave.ARLINGTON (CONT'D)Until then... a good day to you,

          that way, but I always thought it
          was Karmic retribution for what I
          did to Norma.ARTHURWhat'd you ever do to Norma?NATHANI dropped that barbell on her foot
          when we were kids. That's why she
          went to get that x-ray. If it
          wasn't for me... she'd still have
          all her toes.ARTHURYou can't think of it that way.NATHANWhy not? It's the truth.ARTHURYou didn't leave the x-ray machine
          on, Dr. Stupid did.NATHANYeah, but my mistake sent her to
          Dr. Stupid... so that makes me
          culpable in the eyes of Buddha.ARTHURYou're no more culpable than the
          company that manufactured the
          barbell. Stop punishing yourself.

          practice medicine.NORMAYou gotta let it go. You gotta
          learn to forgive and forget.SUSANI'd be willing to forgive him if he
          would've just admitted his
          negligence under oath. The bastard
          lied... said it was the x-ray
          machine that malfunctioned.
          SENATOR GRIFFITH POWELL (50s) and his son EDWARD POWELL
          ( 20s), approach. Edward is the husband-to-be.SUSAN (CONT'D)Well Senator! You look very spiffy

          house. RED LIGHT envelops the room. There are two long wooden
          WORK BENCHES running down the middle.
          There are a series of BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPHS hanging
          from a wire. Each one shows a different view of the surface
          of MARS.DANAIs that Mars?WALTERYep.39.DANAWhat did your dad have to do with
          the Viking?WALTERHe helped design the camera.
          Walter points to a PLASTIC PROTOTYPE MODEL of the VIKING
          LANDER mounted on a third WORK BENCH at the end of the room.
          A model of the MARS SURFACE has been re-created and painted
          with exacting detail.WALTER (CONT'D)He's making the model for the
          science museum.
          Walter points to one of TWO CAMERAS mounted on the front of
          the SPIDER-SHAPED LANDING MODULE. The camera is cylindrical
          and features a VERTICAL SLOT on the front.WALTER (CONT'D)They designed the camera to
          photograph in 360 degrees. It scans
          in the image one line at a time...
          and takes about five minutes to
          complete one revolution.DANAHow do they get the images back to
          earth?WALTERRadio transmission. They figured
          out a way to interpret the scan
          lines and then print them onto
          film.DANAHow long does it take to transmit
          back to earth?WALTERAbout ten hours.
          Dana looks over at the wall and sees a NEW YORK TIMES FRONT
          PAGE from September with a large image of MARS on it.WALTER (CONT'D)They tested the camera in the
          parking lot at Langley last year.
          Walter points to another FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH on the wall. In
          the black & white photograph, we see a group of FIFTY NASA
          EMPLOYEES assembled in a long line in a PARKING LOT.
          Walter points to his father standing in the group.40.WALTER (CONT'D)There's my dad.
          He moves his finger across the line of smiling faces...
          ARTHUR appears for a SECOND TIME in the row.WALTER (CONT'D)And there he is again.
          Walter then moves his finger down toward the right side of
          the photo... ARTHUR LEWIS appears for a third time.WALTER (CONT'D)And there he is again.
          Dana looks close at the photo.DANAHow'd he do that?WALTERBecause the camera takes five
          minutes to scan in 360 degrees, he
          waited until the camera passed over
          him then jumped ahead in the
          circle.
          The CAMERA moves in closer to the photograph... to the THIRD
          VERSION of ARTHUR LEWIS.DANAYour dad sounds pretty clever.WALTERMy dad is more than just clever,
          Dana. My dad is the coolest man who
          ever walked the face of the earth.

          to another MAN kneeling on the pavement directly below him.

          Arthur has nothing to do with this.RESTON/ARLINGTONI'm sorry, but the offer is not
          negotiable.(TO ARTHUR)And if Norma's fingers so much as
          touch the weapon at any point from
          this moment on... the restoration
          of Walter's sight and sound will be
          denied.NORMAIf Arthur has to do it... then I
          want you to make it look like a
          suicide. Arthur shouldn't be
          punished for something that I did.RESTON/ARLINGTONI'm sorry... but the terms of the
          offer are not negotiable.
          Arthur faces has gone completely white.ARTHURIs there an afterlife?
          The twins smile cryptically in response to Arthur's question.ARTHUR (CONT'D)Because this is purgatory, right?
          The earth is purgatory... and
          you're here to start shutting
          things down... right?
          The twins appear impressed with his foresight.103.RESTON/ARLINGTONI find your theory to be quite
          fascinating. But I must remind you
          that I am unable to disclose the
          identity of my employers.
          Arthur glances out the window at all of the cameras.ARTHURRight. I get it.

          car?EXT. HOWARD JOHNSON -- DINER -- MOMENTS LATERArthur and Norma emerge from the diner in a state of
          delirium. A SOLDIER pulls up in Arthur's TRANS-AM. He steps
          out of the car and holds the door open.
          Teague and Cahill approach... as MEN in dark suits snap
          hundreds of photographs of the couple.
          Cahill puts his hand on Arthur's shoulder... searching for
          words.
          Teague glances inside the diner... then back at Arthur.
          Arthur nods his head slowly... his mind lost... and he limps
          toward the car with Norma at his side.INT. ARTHUR'S CAR -- NEXTNorma sits behind the wheel... allowing Arthur to ride
          shotgun. He looks weakened by the whole ordeal, and she is
          afraid he might pass out.ARTHURTell me this isn't happening,
          Norma.NORMAThis isn't happening...
          She starts the engine... and they drive off.
          Arthur watches the parking lot full of MEN reflected back at
          them in the side-view mirror.104.EXT. INTERSTATE 95 -- SUNRISEHELICOPTER SHOT: The CAMERA flies over 1-95 as Arthur's car

          riding in silence for quite some time now, having reached a
          level of complete mental and physical exhaustion.NORMAAll these years... I've given you
          the impression that Walter was an
          accident.ARTHURYeah... and?NORMAAnd... it wasn't exactly an
          accident.(BEAT)I stopped taking the pill when I
          met you...ARTHURWhy?NORMABecause I was so afraid of losing
          you to someone prettier than me.
          Arthur just stares at her... unsure how to respond.NORMA (CONT'D)For that alone... I deserve a
          bullet in the heart... don't you
          think?ARTHURNo... I don't.
          She manages a smile. A tear rolls down her cheek as she
          stares out at the pavement and the endless trees lining
          either side of the interstate.EXT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FOYER -- EARLY MORNINGArthur pulls the car up into the driveway. The street is

          She rises to her feet as they approach.DANADid my dad tell you why he loves
          you, Norma?
          Norma realizes that she has been involved all along. Blood
          drains from her nose.NORMANo.DANABecause you're an amputee. He says
          that the soul of an amputee leaks
          out into the wind... searching for
          the place where there is no longer
          flesh and bone.(BEAT)It says that the soul that leaks is
          the soul that endures. It is the

          all.NORMAWhere is our son?DANAHe's locked in the upstairs
          bathroom. I think he just woke up.

          tile floor. He runs into the door... and then reaches up and
          finds the DOORKNOB. It is locked.
          He begins to bang on the door relentlessly.INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- NEXTNorma and Arthur come up the stairs and round the corner of
          the hallway. Walter's HAND reaches out through the crack
          beneath the door.

          installed on it.NORMAWalter!

          from inside the bathroom.WALTERWho's there? Who's there?
          Norma rises to her feet.NORMACome downstairs, Arthur.
          She takes his left hand... as he clutches Walter's hand in

          no time to wait any longer.ARTHURWell then.(BEAT)Let's get on with it.
          Arthur kisses her... then steps back... still clutching her
          hand... raises the gun... and fires off a round into her
          heart.
          Norma collapses... Arthur falls with her... breaking her fall
          with his arms as they collapse into a heap onto the linoleum

          The Operator begins to ask more questions... but Arthur does
          not listen. He hangs up the phone.

          Out of the corner of his eye, Arthur notices something at the
