    meticulously constructs his combover. Camera WRAPS AROUND,
    see his hands with rings adjust his dark velvet suit, up to
    his face, serious, concentrated, intense, he is composing
    himself before a performance.

    Irving is now dressed, ready, and walks down the hall to
    another room.3   SECOND PLAZA HOTEL ROOMIrving composes himself -- looks     
    into cramped surveillance closet, there are FBI Agents -- we
    only see their hands and arms -- he looks at monitors -- sees
    a BLACK AND WHITE IMAGE OF ANOTHER ROOM ON MONITOR: MAYOR
    CARMINE POLITO, swath of salt and pepper hair, cream suit,
    pinky ring, Rotary Club pin -- ALONG WITH CARL ELWAY, preppie
    shady businessman.

    He exhales pressure, turns as CAMERA PANS TO: SYDNEY PROSSER
    (who will also be known for some time as EDITH GREENSLY),
    stylish crafty smart. They stare at each other intensely --
    they have a deep and emotional relationship. A DOOR BANGS
    OPEN, and in walks RICHIE DIMASO, Bronx-born. He stands
    there.RICHIE DIMASOWhat are you doing, going behind my
               back? Telling people I'm screwing

               this --

    Richie reaches out and puts his hand on Irving's face very
    carefully, not forcefully.

    Irving swipes it away violently the second it touches his
    face.IRVING ROSENFELDDon't you fucking touch me. That
          bothers me --RICHIE DIMASOOh it does?IRVING ROSENFELDOh yeah.RICHIE DIMASOThat bothers you?IRVING ROSENFELDYes.RICHIE DIMASOYou know, a lot of shit bothers me
          too, but I was trying to help you.
          If I wanted to bother you, if I
          really wanted to fucking bother
          you, this is what I'd do.


    Richie takes his hand and destroys the combover Irving spent
    so much time creating. Irving just stands there, hair ruined,
    staring at Richie.IRVING ROSENFELDYou shouldn't have done that.

    Irving just stands there staring at Richie, hair all wild and
    messed up looking very angry.RICHIE DIMASOHow's that? You bothered now? (no
          answer) Alright, don't make a thing
          of it.EDITH GREENSLYYou shouldn't touch him. He doesn't
          like that.4.RICHIE DIMASOOh my god, fix his hair. Don't make
              a thing of it.EDITH GREENSLYIt takes some time, ok.

    Edith walks over to Irving who is still standing there in
    silence with his hair all over the place. She carefully
    starts helping him put it back together.RICHIE DIMASOBig fucking deal. We got to get in
              the other room, come on. The
              mayor's in there.EDITH GREENSLYYes I know that.RICHIE DIMASOShould we go to the beauty parlor?
              Is that what we should do?

    Richie walks over and opens up a briefcase that's sitting on
    the dresser. Inside are stacks of cash.

    Edith is still helping Irving put his hair back together.IRVING ROSENFELDHow's it look.EDITH GREENSLYYou look fine.

    to Carmine unprompted. LEAVE MONITOR'S POV AND RETURN BACK TOTHE SCENE.IRV'S EYES WIDEN AS IN `NO! DON'T DO THAT!' WHILE HE ANDRICHIE STARE AT EACH OTHER, EDITH TENSE, CARMINE LOOKSDISTURBED AT THE CASE COMING HIS WAY. HE STANDS ABRUPTLY.CARL ELWAYWhoa, excuse me, excuse me. I'll
              handle that for the Mayor.RICHIE DIMASONo, it's for the Mayor. It would be
              a sign of disrespect to the sheik
              if the mayor didn't take it
              himself. It's for you Mayor.

    Carmine looks angry and confused. He looks over to Carl.CARMINE POLITOWhat are you doing? What-- (to
              Carl) Carl, what the fuck? What is

          Sheik. You let me know when THAT
          could happen! Thank you, have a

all the way this is going and horrified that Richie has
ruined it.CARL ELWAY(leaving)

          get him.RICHIE DIMASONo, you have no choice. You have
          to go get him. Now, go get him, so
          he takes the briefcase by himself!
          That's the whole plan, Irving!

Irving stands up angry and gets in Richie's face.IRVING ROSENFELDWhat were you doing pushing the
          fucking briefcase, dummy? Huh?RICHIE DIMASOThe whole fuckin' thing was falling
          apart. You know how much I paid

              had this air about him. And he had
              this confidence that drew me to

              didn't care.IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)Like me, she was a very particular
              person. Like me, she came from a
              place where her options were

          I'm saying that I could. And I'm
          saying that that is why I don't
          like divorce, Irving. Women do that
          in divorces. Women get the
          children, and then the fathers
          never see them. My mother never got
          divorced. My grandmother never got
          divorced. There are NO divorces in
          my family. I am not getting a

               you 'cause I thought it'd be better
               for you. There's a wire here.
               They're scared because people hang
               themselves but I know you're too
               smart for that. Where's the table
               and chair? There's no bed here?
               It's like a fucking asylum. Joe, is
               everybody off today? Jesus Christ
               it's scary. Maybe I wanted to scare
               you. I don't know. Maybe it was my
               idea. Maybe i'm a little off the

     cup to her lips.RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)I know you think -- look at me.
               Hey. Edith.(MORE)33.RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)I know you think Irv loves you. I
          know you think you know him -- that
          he sees the world as a cold, dark
          place, and he cares about nobody
          but very few people on his short
          list: his son, his father, Rosalyn,
          and you. And you think you're at
          the top of that list. But what if
          you're not. What if you're not even
          on the list at all? He'd be in
          here right now if he took the
          check.

She thinks about this. She trembles.RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)He'd be in here right now if he
          took the check. But no, you did.
          God, it's, it's so clear to me.
          It's so crazy -- it's clear to me,
          but it's not clear to you. He uses
          you, Edith, to protect himself. To
          protect his son and his wife in
          Long Island. No? Yes. He put a
          ring on her finger, he adopted her
          son. They have huge house, they
          have two cars. What does she do all
          day? I'll tell you what she does --
          she plays with her nails, she
          watches T.V., and she spends your
          money, the money that you make.

Edith stares at Richie, taking this in.RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)I don't like that you're in jail
          while he's going free. I don't
          like any of that. I want to help
          you. All the razzle-dazzle that he
          does, it's not good. It's not real.
          It's fake. It's not real. Who you
          are is who you are, between you and
          God. You and your soul. That's what
          matters. That's what counts.
          That's what I'm about. And that's
          what I see in you. Tell me you
          didn't feel it the first time we
          saw each other. Am I crazy? I don't
          think so. I'm not supposed to be
          talking like this, but I don't
          care, I break the rules.

he's saying.34.RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)Okay, Edith? Edith. I want to help

     hands of WELL-WISHERSRICHIE DIMASO (V.O.)My boss Stoddard proceeded to tell
               me that Carmine Polito was the most
               quietly powerful person in the
               state of New Jersey. A lifetime
               native of the very racially mixed
               Camden, which had become a ghetto,
               and where he had been Mayor for ten
               years. A very beloved guy. A guy
               who never gave up on his people.
               His father had emigrated from Italy
               and had stoked coal.

               his household was a joyous place.
               And his wife Dolly, she was the
               apple of his eye and the center of
               the household. I mean everyone
               loved this guy.

          fishing in October. My dad says,

starting to go down a SPIRAL OF DEPRESSION as she looks
increasingly uncomfortable.ROSALYN ROSENFELD(re: the mob guys)

puts it on table.PETE MUSANE AND GUYSOhhhh, heyyyyy! Come onnn!ROSALYNIt's because he's a party pooper.
          He's so boring.

Irving stares fuming at Rosalyn and the guys, he nods and
forces a smile good naturedly as they put prosecco glass in
his hand. He knows how to fake it.90.PETE MUSANEYou have a very beautiful wife.DICK HELSING, ROSALYN ROSENFELD, OTHERGUYSSalud.THE MADE GUYS LAUGH. SYD ROLLS HER EYES.

and she drops into Pete Musane's lap.91.ROSALYN ROSENFELDHey Irving, I'm going to be having
                 fun. Maybe it will be contagious.


       Irving turns and heads with dread towards the back door with

                 was known to never bury a body

          exit. I'm like a   ghost. Nobody
          knows I'm here.

Busboys whip open a white table cloth for the table.

Everyone sits down. Tellegio looks at the Sheik, then over to
Richie.VICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D)Tell him I speak for our friends in
          Florida. We're very excited. It's
          been our lifelong dream to build
          casino resorts on the East Coast.

Richie pretends to translate in the Sheik's ear.VICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D)You told him that? They didn't want
          the Jews to make money, they didn't
          want the Italians to make money,
          definitely don't want the blacks to
          make money. After the oil embargo --
          the gasoline crisis -- the
          hijackings, the Olympics, they
          don't want to see Arabs make money,
          trust me, not on our soil. You can
          tell him this in your own way: I've
          been in the casino business forty
          years. It's scrutinized more
          carefully than any other business.
          Carmine made this legal, but we
          must be careful or they'll take it
          away.CARMINE POLITOSo, Mister Tellegio, how do you

where this is going.CARMINE POLITOTo expedite citizenship -- well,

          We deal with you, we don't know
          what we're dealing with.

Everyone stares increasingly tense at Tellegio in silence.
This could go wrong at any minute. Tellegio looks over to
Richie and points to the Sheik.

Irving watches in horror as --VICTOR TALLEGIOWhere's he from?RICHIE DIMASO(winging it)

          Tell me.)RICHIE DIMASOUh, I think, I think what he's --95.VICTOR TELLEGIONo, let him speak for himself.

Sheik swallows hard and looks to Richie. It's a very tense
moment for everyone at the table.

Tellegio stares. Everyone hangs on this. Irving and Richie
share a look -- what is he doing?

A DRUNK, AL KOWALSKI, a working man, friend of the Mayor
BARRELS INTO INTO THE TABLE, spilling drinks. Tellegio's guys
jump in and grab him and start to pull him away.CARMINE POLITONo, I know him.AL KOWALSKIYou guys are way too serious for a
          party!(to Tellegio) Hey, what are

          waiting for you.CARMINE POLITOAl, I'll be right behind you, okay?
          Trust me.

Paco Hernandez/Sheik stands up and reaches over to Tellegio
to shake his hand. Irving panics. THE MENACING DEEP BASSINTRO OF "WHITE RABBIT" FADES UP ON THE SOUNDTRACK.SHEIK ABDULLAH(In Arabic)
          It is great doing business with
          you. The investment is real. It was
          a pleasure to meet you.

Irving exhales in relief that Paco managed to say anything
passable in Arabic.96.IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)What are the odds of an Italian guy
          from Miami knowing Arabic? But it
          turns out he's got casino
          investments in the Mideast and he
          spent two years learning it to keep
          the upper hand.

Victor leans over to talk to Carmine.VICTOR TELLEGIOListen to me carefully. If you're
          real, you put ten million in the
          bank of our choice in the next two
          weeks.

Carmine nods.VICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D)Carmine, listen to me carefully, if
          you're real, you put ten million in
          the bank of our choice in the next
          two weeks or not only will the
          Sheik feel insulted, but our
          friends in Florida will feel deeply
          disrespected and so will I.
