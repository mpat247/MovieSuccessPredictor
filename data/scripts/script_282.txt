      banners -- that sway gently in the breeze.PAPEL PICADO CARD: "COCO"MIGUEL (V.O.)Sometimes I think I'm cursed...
                  'cause of something that happened
                  before I was even born.

      A story begins to play out on the papel picado.MIGUEL (V.O.)See, a long time ago there was this
                  family.

      The images on the papel picado come to life to illustrate a
      father, a mother, and a little girl. The family is happy.MIGUEL (V.O.)The pap�, he was a musician.

      The pap� plays guitar while the mother dances with her
      daughter.MIGUEL (V.O.)He and his family would sing, and
                  dance, and count their blessings...

                  But he also had a dream... to play
                  for the world.

                  And one day he left with his
                  guitar... and never returned.

      The man walks down a road, guitar slung on his back. In
      another vignette his daughter stands in the doorway, watching
      her pap� leave. Two feet step up next to her. It is her
      mam�, hardened.

      She shuts the door.2.MIGUEL (V.O.)And the mam�...? She didn't have
                  time to cry over that walkaway
                  musician!

      records.MIGUEL (V.O.)She found a way to provide for her
                  daughter...

                  She rolled up her sleeves and she
                  learned to make shoes.

                  She could have made candy!

      Amongst the papel picado, a stick swings at a strung up
      pi�ata which bursts with candy...MIGUEL (V.O.)Or fireworks!

      Fireworks go off in the background...MIGUEL (V.O.)Or sparkly underwear for wrestlers!

      Sparkly underwear and a luchador mask hang on a line amongst
      other linens...MIGUEL (V.O.)But no... she chose shoes...

      On the papel picado, the little girl becomes a young woman.MIGUEL (V.O.)Then she taught her daughter to
                  make shoes. And later, she taught
                  her son-in-law.

      She introduces a suitor to the family business.MIGUEL (V.O.)Then her grandkids got roped in.
                  As her family grew, so did the
                  business.

      TILT DOWN from the papel picado to theOFRENDA ROOM - DAYwhere a photo sits at the top of a beautiful altar. The
      photo features MAM� IMELDA -- serious, formidable. She holds
      a baby on her lap. Her husband stands beside her, but his
      face has been torn away.MIGUEL (V.O.)She died WAY before I was born.
                  But my family still tells her story
                  every year on D�a de los Muertos --
                  the Day of the Dead...

                  Coco has trouble remembering
                  things... But it's good to talk to
                  her anyway. So I tell her pretty
                  much everything.

      QUICK CUTS of Miguel with Mam� Coco:4.EXT. COURTYARDMIGUELI used to run like this...

      Miguel pumps his arms with his hands in fists.           Then he

      sending feathers onto Mam� Coco who wears a mask of her own.CUT TO:EXT. DINING AREAMiguel leans toward Mam� Coco at the dinner table.MIGUELI have a dimple on this side, but

      Miguel's ABUELITA (70s) runs the table like a ship captain.
      She gives Mam� Coco a kiss on the head.MIGUEL (V.O.)My Abuelita? She's Mam� Coco's
                  daughter.

      Abuelita piles extra tamales on Miguel's plate.ABUELITAAw, you're a twig, mijo.         Have some

      Once outside, Miguel makes his way through the small town ofSANTA CECILIA - MORNINGMIGUEL (V.O.)I am NOT like the rest of my
                  family...

      He passes a woman sweeping a stoop.WOMANHola, Miguel!MIGUELHola!

      He passes a band of musicians playing a tune. Miguel joins
      with some air guitar and the further down the street he goes,
      the more instruments and sounds layer in. The bells of the
      church chime in harmony, a radio blares a cumbia rhythm.7.Running past a food stand, Miguel grabs a roll of pan dulce
      and tosses the vendor a coin.MIGUELMuchas gracias!STREET VENDORDe nada, Miguel!

      As Miguel passes all these scenes, the music synthesizes and
      he can't help but tap out rhythms along a table of alebrijes.
      The fantastical wooden animal sculptures each play a
      different tone like a marimba. Miguel finishes with a SMACK
      on a trash can, out of which a pops up a scrappy hairless
      Xolo dog. The dog, DANTE, barks and jumps up to lick Miguel,
      who laughs.MIGUELHey, hey!    Dante!

      Miguel holds the pan dulce over Dante's head.MIGUELSit. Down. Roll over.        Shake.

      back into the trash can.CUT TO:MARIACHI PLAZA - MOMENTS LATERMiguel rounds the corner toward the town square. Vendors
      sell sugar skulls and marigolds, and musicians fill the
      square with music.MIGUEL (V.O)I know I'm not supposed to love

      heart of the plaza.8.MIGUEL (V.O)...The greatest musician of all
                  time.

      A tour group and their TOUR GUIDE are gathered around the
      base of the statue.TOUR GUIDEAnd right here, in this very plaza,
                  the young Ernesto de la Cruz took

      the plaza, serenading bystanders in a train car...MIGUEL (V.O.)He started out a total nobody from
                  Santa Cecilia, like me. But when
                  he played music, he made people
                  fall in love with him.

      MORE CLIPS from de la Cruz's films. He leaps from a tree
      branch onto a galloping horse. He plays his signature skull
      guitar with flourish and flair.MIGUEL (V.O.)He starred in movies. He had the
                  coolest guitar... He could fly!

      A CLIP features de la Cruz dressed as a hovering priest, held
      up by strings, in front of a cycling sky flat.MIGUEL (V.O.)And he wrote the best songs! But

      As the audience swoons over de la Cruz, an absent-minded

                  I get this feeling... like we're
                  connected somehow. Like, if HE
                  could play music, maybe someday I
                  could too...10.EXT. MARIACHI PLAZA - DAYMIGUEL (CONT'D)...If it wasn't for my family.PLAZA MARIACHI(playful)

      Miguel comes out of his reverie and looks up at the PLAZA
      MARIACHI whose shoes he is shining.MIGUELOh, yeah, sorry.

      He goes back to scrubbing the man's shoe.    As Miguel shines,
      the mariachi plucks his guitar idly.MIGUELI just can't really talk about any
                  of this at home so...PLAZA MARIACHILook, if I were you I'd march right
                  up to my family and say, "Hey! I'm

                  best musician by hiding his sweet,
                  sweet skills? No! He walked out
                  onto that plaza and he played out
                  loud!11.The mariachi gets an idea. He points to the gazebo where
      organizers are setting up for a show. They unfurl a canvas
      poster which reads "TALENT SHOW."PLAZA MARIACHI (CONT'D)Ah, mira, mira! They're setting up
                  for tonight. The music competition

                  say?MIGUEL...Seize your moment?

      The mariachi appraises Miguel, then offers his guitar.PLAZA MARIACHIShow me what you got, muchacho.
                  I'll be your first audience.

      Miguel's brows rise, surprised. He reaches to take the
      instrument, regarding it as if holding a holy relic.

      Miguel spreads his fingers across the strings anticipating
      his chord and...ABUELITA (O.S.)MIGUEL!Startled, Miguel impulsively throws the guitar back onto the
      mariachi's lap. He turns to see Abuelita marching toward
      him. Miguel's T�O BERTO (40s) and PRIMA ROSA (16), follow
      with supplies from the market.MIGUELAbuelita!ABUELITAWhat are you doing here?12.MIGUELUm...uh...

      Miguel quickly packs away his shine rag and polishes.
      Abuelita barrels up to the mariachi.

                  wants no part of your music,

      The mariachi scrambles away, snatching his hat off the
      ground before he goes. Abuelita hugs Miguel protectively to
      her bosom.ABUELITAAy, pobrecito! Est�s bien, mijo?

      She peppers him with kisses then releases him from the
      embrace. He gasps for air.ABUELITA(distressed)

      with reverence, illuminating an album cover of de la Cruz
      holding his skull guitar.

      Miguel compares the head of his guitar to the album cover.

      Los Chachalacos file onto the funicular, the sousaphone
      player angling his instrument away from the security guard.
      After they get onto the funicular, he turns to reveal a pair
      of legs hanging out of the bell of the sousaphone. With a

      Miguel heads off toward the mansion.

      On the stairs leading up, the party is bustling --

      Miguel takes it all in. Synchronized swimmers make
      formations in a sparkling indoor pool. A DJ lays a decades-
      spanning mash-up soundtrack.

      The passionate words embolden Miguel. He climbs a pillar to
      the landing of a grand staircase, he stands above the crowd.

      Miguel takes a breath and throws out a grito as loud as he
      can. It echoes through the space, and party guests turn.
      The DJ fades the music.

      Garnering some attention, Miguel plays his guitar.   More
      guests turn.

      sleeves, and, in true movie hero fashion, jumps into the pool
      and lifts a coughing Miguel to the edge.DE LA CRUZAre you all right, ni�o?

      Miguel looks up, mortified. His painted face begins to run,
      revealing him to be a living boy. De la Cruz's eyes go wide.
