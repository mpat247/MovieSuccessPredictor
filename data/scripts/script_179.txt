     center of what seems to be a makeshift "meditation" space.

     We slowly tilt up to discover the back of Riggan Thomson (55).
     He is in the proper `Lotus' position, dressed only in tight
     white briefs and he appears to be meditating deeply. And if all
     this seems a little odd, it becomes all the more so when you
     notice that he is levitating almost two feet above the floor.
     His breath is calm and measured... in and out... in and out.MAN (V.O.)How did we end up here?
                   (Beat.)
               This place is a fucking dump.

     We begin to slowly move toward Riggan's back while his measure
     breathing continues. We see a clock on the wall, ticking.MAN (V.O.)Smells like balls.

     A slight twitch in Riggan's neck.MAN (V.O.)We don't belong in this shithole.

     A Skype call shatters the silence. Close on his back, we follow
     Riggan as he walks over to the computer and answers the call.
     On the computer screen appears Sam (21), in a pair of Levi's
     and a Led Zeppelin T-shirt. She has simple and striking good
     looks, with an edge in her voice and behind her eyes. She
     stands in a Korean Deli among the flowers, talking to Riggan
     through her iPhone.1A                                                                1AThe Korean Store owner (50) stands in the background screaming
     at her the whole time.RIGGANSam, I can't--(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   2.SAMDad? What kind of--

              What kind of flowers did you say you
              wanted?RIGGANAlchemillas. Or something soothing that
              smells nice. Listen I can't--SAMIt all smells like fucking Kimchi!RIGGANThen whatever looks nice. Anything but
              roses. No roses.KOREANFlowers don't need you touch! They need you
              buy!!!SAM(Close into the screen.)
              I hate this job.

    And the Skype call is over. Riggan closes the laptop and leans
    forward trying to regain his calm. His reflection appears in
    the mirror, and for the first time we see his face. He has a
    dark goatee and his hair looks strangely abundant. There is a
    piece of paper on the mirror with the handwritten phrase "A
    thing is a thing, not what it is said of that thing."ANNIE ON SPEAKERSRiggan, they're starting scene
              five. We need you on stage.RIGGANShit...
    Riggan throws on a sweater and stumbles into his slacks. He
    hurries out...2   INT. HALLWAYS - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            2...through the narrow corridors of the theater. There is a lot
    of activity as various workers and stage hands appear and
    disappear carrying equipment and scenery. As Riggan descends the
    stairs, a Stage Hand� passes by in the opposite direction.STAGE HAND�Mr. Thomson.(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   3.RIGGANSteve.STAGE HAND�It's Daniel.RIGGAN(Already passed.)
              Okay.

    Riggan continues on until he arrives backstage. He runs into
    Jake (42) his producer and friend.JAKEHow's it going, buddy.RIGGANGreat. It'd be even better if I
              could get Ralph to stop acting like
              he's in an educational video for
              syphilis...
    The camera moves off of them and onto...3   INT. STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                              3...the stage. Suddenly we are in the midst of an Americana style
    kitchen.

    Around the kitchen table sit Lesley (35), plain and no nonsense,
    her simple hairstyle and makeup can't hide how attractive she
    is. Laura (35), dark, exotic, the kind of woman who makes every
    person she meets feel like she's seducing them. And Ralph (40),
    slightly handsome, slightly balding, slightly invisible.

    A half empty bottle of gin on the table, they drink from
    highball glasses as they chat...LESLEYHe loved me.RALPHYeah. He loved her so much he tried
              to kill her.LAURAHe tried to kill you?LESLEYNo. (A beat.) Okay, well, he did
              beat me up one night. He dragged me
              around the living room by my
              ankles, yelling "I love you, I love(MORE)(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   4.LESLEY (CONT'D)you, bitch." What do you do with a
          love like that?RALPHHow is that-- That is not love and you know
          it. Why do you insist on calling it--LESLEYYou can say what you want, but I know what
          it was.RALPHWhat about you, Nick? Does that sound like
          love to you?

Riggan arrives at the table and sits.RIGGANSorry I'm late.
              (Beat. In character.)
          I'm the wrong person to ask. I didn't
          know the man. I've only heard his name
          mentioned in passing. You'd have to
          know the particulars. But I think what
          you're saying is that love is absolute.RALPHYeah. The kind of love I'm talking about
          is... The kind of love I'm talking about,
          you don't try and kill people.LESLEY(Sadly.)
          It was love, Mel. To Eddie, it was. I don't
          care what anybody says. He was ready to die
          for it.RALPHAsk her what he did after she left him.LESLEYHe shot himself in the mouth. But he
          screwed that up, too. Poor Ed.RALPHPoor Ed, my ass. The guy was dangerous.LAURAHow'd he screw it up if he shot himself in
          the mouth?RALPH(By the numbers.)
          He used to carry this twenty-two. We lived
          like fugitives those days. I never knew--(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   5.RIGGAN(Breaking character to direct.
               Exasperated.)
          Okay. Fugitives are on the run, Ralph. How
          many times do I have to-- Fugitives are
          scared. Give me more of that.

Ralph nods. He takes a breath and dives in once again...RALPH(The same but louder.)
          We lived like fugitives those days...

Extremely frustrated, Riggan stares out into the auditorium.
From his POV we see Jake who is now sitting in the third row.
His head buried in his hands, tortured by Ralph's performance.
Riggan turns back to Ralph.RALPH (CONT'D)...I never knew if he was going to come out
          of the bushes or from behind a car and just
          start shooting.

Riggan watches Ralph act and sees his whole production headed
down the drain. Ralph is just that bad.RALPH (CONT'D)The man was crazy. He was capable of
          anything.

The actors all wait for a cue from Riggan, who is now staring
up into the lights above the stage. Laura finally picks up
Riggan's cue.LAURAChrist. What a nightmare...RALPHHe used to call me at the hospital and
          say...
              (Over the top.)
          "Son of a bitch. Your days are numbered."

Silence. Ralph looks over to Riggan.RALPH (CONT'D)Too much? Little bit? I just wanted to give
          you a range, so you could--

And with that a light comes barreling down from it's perch and
crashes into Ralph's head, making him hit the floor like a rag
doll. Silence.LAURAHoly shit.(CONTINUED)10/29/14    /   6.Lesley and Annie (35), the Stage Manager, run over to Ralph
    who is out cold. Not knowing what to do, they stare at him.LESLEYIs he breathing?

    Jake runs toward the stage.JAKESomeone call 911!
    Riggan slowly backs away from the chaos.LAURAIs that blood coming out of his
              ear?JAKE(To Riggan.)
              Where are you going?LESLEYOkay, he's breathing. What did he
              have for lunch?LAURADid anyone call for help?ANNIE(Clapping.)
              Wake up! Wake up!

    Two crew members try to help Ralph.CREW MEMBERGrab his legs. I got the top.JAKEDon't move him! Wait for the ambulance.
                  (Calling out.)
              For the love of God! I could get a black
              audience in this theater faster than a
              doctor!

    Riggan heads off the stage, and Jake chases after him. We
    follow them as...4   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                           4...they walk through the corridor.JAKEWhere are you going? We'll have the
              understudy ready to rehearse in five--(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   7.RIGGANForget the understudy. We have to postpone
          the preview.JAKEWhat are you-- It's a full house. We would
          have to refund all the--RIGGANThen do it.
A crew member� passes in the opposite direction.CREW MEMBER�How's Ralph?RIGGANHe'll be fine.JAKEWait. Wait. Fuck. Wait.RIGGANListen to me. It was going to be a
          disaster. That guy's the worst actor I've
          ever seen. The blood coming out of his ear
          was the most honest thing he's done so far.JAKEHe's not that bad.

Riggan stops in his tracks and stares at Jake.JAKE (CONT'D)Okay, he's fucking horrible. But--

Riggan starts walking again.JAKE (CONT'D)You have the press in your dressing
          room in a few hours. How are we--RIGGANI'll make something up.

Two Technicians� hurry up in the opposite direction.RIGGAN (CONT'D)Jake. This happened for a reason. It wasn't
          an accident.JAKEWhat do you mean?(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   8.RIGGANI-- (A beat.) I made it happen.JAKEOh. Okay.

              prequel.
    They arrive at Riggan's dressing room.RIGGANWhat's his name? Jeremy Renner...JAKEWho?RIGGANThe... the Hurt Locker guy.JAKEYeah. He's an Avenger.RIGGAN(With disgust.)
              Fuck. They put him in a cape, too?
              (A beat.) Look, I don't care. Find
              me someone.
    Riggan enters...5   INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS            5...his dressing room and tries to shut the door. Jake, still in
    the corridor, stops it with his foot.JAKE(Sticking his head in.)
              Ralph'll sue us. He'll sue us. And he's got
              a case.(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   9.Riggan releases the door.RIGGANThen make him go away.JAKEHow do you suggest I do that?RIGGANYou're my   lawyer, my producer and
          my oldest   friend. We are going to
          make this   work. Now just get out
          there and   do what you were born to
          do.JAKEWhat's that?RIGGANI have no idea. But I have faith.
          Now go away from me.JAKEDo you think we should--

Riggan slams the door shut on Jake. A beat. On a television, a
segment of E! News. A busty blond, with an exaggerated smile,
hosts.BLOND WOMAN...and when we come back, an exclusive
          interview with Robert Downey Jr., who tells
          us about the billion-dollar Iron Man
          franchise. The talented actor invited us
          onto the set of Iron Man 3...

Riggan slams the tv off, his mind racing. He sits on a chair.MAN (V.O.)That clown doesn't have half your talent
          and he's making a fortune in that Tin Man
          get up.

Riggan stares into the mirror, in the reflection he catches
sight of a poster from a movie called "Birdman 3". The
superhero, Birdman (a younger Riggan in a bird costume), wings
widely spread, stares directly back at him. A hand written
note on the top of the poster reads: "Thomson, break a wing!
From the boys at Local 1." Riggan tries to calm himself with a
mantra...RIGGAN"Breathing in, I embrace my anger.
          Breathing out, I smile to it."(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   10.BIRDMAN (V.O.)Embrace it. Kiss it. Turn it around and
          fuck it in the--

A knock on the door behind him.RIGGANNot now!

Laura opens the door and sticks her head in.LAURACan I come in?RIGGANNo.LAURAOkay. Two words. Shia La Beouf.RIGGANThat's three words.LAURAIt's two.RIGGANGet out.LAURAI love you.

She closes the door. Riggan tries to calm himself down, but
Laura opens the door again.LAURA (CONT'D)I take it we're not going to dinner
          anymore?RIGGANI don't have an actor.LAURAI don't have a life.RIGGANLaura...LAURAFine. Whatever.
              (Goes to leave but stops.)
          You remember at Joan's when you
          asked me to come do a Broadway play
          with you? You said it would be
          fun...(CONTINUED)10/29/14     /   11.RIGGANGo away.LAURASo far? No fun.

     Riggan closes the door and looks at the Birdman poster.BIRDMAN (V.O.)Fun? You know what would be fun? Getting
               the fuck out of here before we humiliate
               ourselves. That would be fun.

     Riggan looks at himself in the mirror and begins to pull at
     his hair. As it comes off his head, we discover it was a wig.
     He turns away from the mirror, trying desperately to stay
     calm. Something catches his eye: a vase of roses on the end
     of the table. A card in them says, "They didn't have the
     whatever you wanted - Sam". Enraged, Riggan focuses on the
     vase. It begins to shift. Then, with a surge of anger,
     without ever touching it, he sends it crashing against the
     wall on the other side of the room.

     The camera pans over the roses scattered across the floor. It
     hovers over the carpet and around the perimeter of the room,
     until it finally settles on Riggan, now dressed in a casual
     blazer.A5                                                                 A5It is later the same day. He is sitting on the sofa and on three
     chairs in front of him are three journalists:

     Gabriel, a geeky theatre journalist, wearing thick glasses and
     a thin tie. Clara, a reporter from an entertainment blog. And
     Han, a polite, obese Japanese journalist, who sits next to his
     translator, another Japanese guy.GABRIELWhy does somebody go from playing the lead
               in a comic book franchise to adapting
               Raymond Carver for the stage?

     Riggan tries to remain calm.GABRIEL (CONT'D)I mean, as you're probably aware, Barthes
               said, "The cultural work done in the past
               by gods and epic sagas is now done by
               laundry detergent commercials and comic
               strip characters." It's a big leap you've
               taken...

     Riggan shifts nervously.(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   12.RIGGANWell... Absolutely. As you said... that
          Barthes said... Birdman, like Icarus...CLARAHang on. Who's this Barthes guy? Which
          Birdman was he in?GABRIELRoland Barthes was a French philosopher,
          who--CLARAOh. Okay. Sure. Now, is it true you've been
          injecting yourself with semen from baby
          pigs?RIGGANWhat?CLARAAs a method of facial rejuvenation.RIGGANWho told you that?CLARAIt was tweeted by... (checks her notes)
          @prostatewhispers.RIGGANIt's a lie.CLARAI know. But did you do it?RIGGANNo!GABRIELAre you afraid at all that people will say
          you're doing this play to battle the
          impression that you're a washed-up super
          hero?RIGGANNo. I'm not. And that's exactly why
          20 years ago I refused to do
          Birdman 4.HANBirdman 4??? You do Birdman 4???

Jake opens the door and the camera pans to him.(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   13.JAKEOkay. That's enough for today.
          Thank you for coming. We're
          expecting some great pieces from
          you...

Riggan stares at the Birdman poster.JAKE (CONT'D)Publicity guys are trying to get
          you a Times feature.
Riggan stands up and pulls the Birdman poster off of the
wall.JAKE (CONT'D)So, How'd it-- Whoa. If I were you
          I wouldn't do that.RIGGANI don't want to look at it anymore.JAKEThat was a present from the crew.
          Don't fuck with those guys, they're
          union.RIGGANI don't care.

Riggan leaves the poster on the floor, facing the wall, and
walks to the window. He opens it. We can hear distant drums
coming from the street.JAKESo... How'd it go?RIGGANGreat.JAKE(Worried.)
          Did they ask about Ralph?RIGGANNope.JAKEGood. He did it, you know? The

               We don't have an actor. And if we
               cancel the first preview the press
               will smell the blood. We can't

Riggan gives Jake a look.JAKEI'll call his agent.

Jake charges out of the room. The camera follows him into...10/29/14   /   17.6   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                         6...the hallway and as Jake makes a left turn, Annie enters from
    the right.JAKEAnnie, turn the work lights on and get me a
              fresh copy of the script. We're gonna have
              a "put in" tonight.ANNIEWho?JAKEYou'll find out...

    Jake disappears down the hall and we follow Annie through the
    theater and onto...7   INT. STAGE - THEATER - EVENING                              7...the stage, where she turns some of the stage work lights on.
    We pan along the stage until we find Riggan, wearing the same
    clothes as before, scanning the empty auditorium.MIKE (O.S.)Intimidating. Isn't it?

    Riggan sees Mike Shiner (39) coming down the aisle, slovenly
    dressed with mussed hair and intense eyes.MIKE (CONT'D)Do you have any idea who walked these
              boards before you?

A sly smile from Mike. He leaps onto the stage.MIKEWhy don't we do a bit of it?RIGGANHey, I wasn't expecting you to--MIKEFirst preview is tomorrow, right?RIGGANYeah, but you can go on with the script
          until you feel comfortable--MIKELet's just do some of it.

Riggan tries to hide his excitement. He grabs the script from a
nearby table and walks it over to Mike.RIGGANTake a look at page twenty--MIKEYeah. I don't need that.RIGGANWhat?MIKEI don't need the script. Just give me a
          cue.RIGGANWhat are you talking about?MIKEFeed me a line.RIGGANI don't-- What?(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   19.MIKEFeed. Me. A line.

Riggan drops the script and begins the scene.RIGGAN"I'm the wrong person to ask. I didn't
          know the man. I've only heard his name
          mentioned in passing. I wouldn't know.

Riggan is transfixed, and almost immediately intimidated.RIGGANHow do you know the lines?MIKEI have a thing, a whatever, a gift.

          off book. Hey, give me that cue again.RIGGAN"I'm the wrong person to ask. I didn't

          person to ask." What's his intention?
          Is he fed up with the topic?

the guy." Right? ...RIGGANYou pretty much know my lines too, huh?MIKECan we-- Are we doing something here? Come
on let's go. Cut it down, give it to me
again.RIGGAN"I'm the wrong person to ask--"MIKEOh, right, sorry, you see? "I'm the wrong

Riggan stands silently, his heart pounding.MIKE (CONT'D)So what do you think, boss? Do I have a
          job?

Riggan calls over to the wings.RIGGANWhat do you think?

Mike turns to see Sam, who has been there for a bit.SAMLarry needs to see him for a fitting.MIKEI'm gonna take that as a yes.

              self-conscious.

    She follows him into the room where we see...9   INT. COSTUME DEPARTMENT - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                 9...Larry stressing out while he works on a costume. He turns
    to see Mike standing there. Sam stands against the wall,
    focused on her cell phone.LARRYOh, thank the Lord and pass the
              biscuits! I finally have an actor to
              dress. Hello, Mr. Shiner.MIKEHow're you doing, Larry?LARRYBetter, now that you're here. Take off your

He turns to see a completely naked Mike.LARRY (CONT'D)Holy-- What is happening? Where are
          your underpants?MIKEAt home, under the bed, I think.

Sam glances at Mike for a second, then returns to her phone.
Larry begins to help Mike into some pants which, given the
situation, is very awkward.LARRYOkay. Everything is too small.SAMYeah, you're not kidding.

Lesley enters the room immediately coming face to face with a
naked Mike. She doesn't notice Sam who is partially hidden by a
clothes rack. She just goes about trying a costume shirt.LESLEYOh, that's nice...

          with my balls out.LESLEYGet dressed. Riggan's daughter is hanging
          around, and I don't need her to walk in

     She puts her head on Riggan's chest. We see his mind racing.
     Laura is moved, and confused.LAURA (CONT'D)Are you excited?RIGGANYeah.LAURAMe too.
     Laura moves slightly away from him and suddenly slaps him across
     the face. Riggan looks at her, confused.RIGGANWhat--?LAURAYou're not funny.

     She kisses him intensely on the lips and briefly places his
     hand on her belly, then moves it up to her breasts. After a
     moment, she backs away.LAURA (CONT'D)First preview tomorrow. Here we go!

     Laura turns and walks away. Riggan continues down the
     corridor. He passes by a Security Guard� in front of a small
     TV. The camera becomes Riggan's POV and advances until...11   INT. BACKSTAGE - THEATER - EVENING                             11...we go through the stage door. We scan the backstage area to
     see the stagehands ready to do their jobs. We can feel the
     electricity of a first preview.

     On stage part of the kitchen set from before is visible. Annie
     stands at her podium, calling the cues for the show.ANNIE(Into her headset.)
               Cue 34 and 35. Go.(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   30.She turns and looks directly into the camera.ANNIE (CONT'D)Places.RIGGAN (O.S.)Okay.

Riggan walks on screen wearing his costume, carrying a bucket of
ice and a bottle of gin. He goes to the opposite side of the
stage and takes his place in the wings. He peeks out at the
audience who seem to be watching with interest.

Then we pan to the stage to find Mike, Lesley and Laura
performing the scene we saw at the beginning, around the table.
Mike looks comfortable, sipping at his drink. A half empty
bottle of gin on the table.MIKEThe maniac shot himself right in front of
          us. I rode with him in the ambulance to the
          hospital.LESLEYI'll never get that image out of my head.
          Right before he did it, his eyes-- they
          were so sad... lonely.LAURADid you have to treat him?MIKEI didn't have to. But I did.
              (Pouring another drink.)
          He was in bad shape. His head swelled
          up to like twice the size of a normal
          head. I'd never seen anything like
          it. And I swear to God, I hope I
          never do again.

Riggan stands near Annie.RIGGANHe's good.ANNIEHe's incredible. I think he's
          drinking real gin.

Riggan looks out at Mike, who is refilling his glass.RIGGANWhat?(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   31.A stagehand gives Riggan a bottle. Riggan watches and waits
     for his cue.MIKEAsk Nick what real love is. He'll

               restaurant?LAURADon't get him started, Mel. You
               haven't seen how he's been lately.

     She gently pushes Riggan and we follow him on stage...12   INT. STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                              12...where Mike goes to refill his glass with the last of the
     real gin. Riggan snatches the bottle out of his hands and
     gulps the rest, straight from the bottle.RIGGANBeen what? (Beat.) I'll tell you
               what real love is. This happened a
               few months ago.

          Like I was saying... There's this
          old couple, had a car wreck out on
          the interstate. Some drunk kid
          plowed his dad's pick up into their
          camper.

We begin to hear the underscoring of violins.RIGGAN (CONT'D)Fucking teenager. By the time I got
          to the hospital, the kid was dead.
          He was off in a corner laid out on
          a gurney. We took the old couple up
          to the O.R.. They were a mess. We
          worked like hell on them for most
          of the night...

Over the speech, Mike reaches for the new bottle that Riggan
placed on stage. He refills his glass.RIGGAN (CONT'D)When we were done, we wrapped them in full
          body casts. The husband was depressed.
          Even when I told him his wife was gonna
          pull through, he was still depressed. So,
          I got up to his mouth hole and asked him,
          and he told me it was because he couldn't
          see her through the eye holes. Can you
          imagine? I'm telling you, the man's heart
          was breaking because he couldn't turn his
          goddamn head and see his goddamn wife.

Riggan is doing a good job. Lesley and Laura are genuinely
moved. Mike notices. He sips his drink.RIGGAN (CONT'D)I mean... It was killing him. Killing him
          that he--MIKEI'm tired of this shit.

     Riggan keeps walking up to...13   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                          13...the hallway. Jake chases him.RIGGANI want him gone.JAKENo.RIGGANWhat?JAKEWe can't do that.RIGGANWhat are you-- Of course we can do that.
               It's our show.(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   35.JAKERiggan, listen to me--

Riggan comes to a halt and faces Jake.RIGGANNo. You listen to me. Get him the fuck out
          of my play. Did you see him out there?JAKEIt was a preview! Nobody gives a shit about
          previews. Nothing matters until that old
          bat from the New York Times is sitting in
          that audience on opening night.RIGGANWe're getting rid of him. I'm not going to
          stand up on that stage and--JAKEShut up! Just shut up for once and
          listen to me. As soon as we announced he
          was taking over, the advance doubled. We
          can't afford to lose a preview. We can't
          afford to lose money. We can't afford to
          lose Mike. This is about being
          respected, validated, remember? That's
          what you told me. That's how you got me
          into this shit. Now, you're the
          director. Get him under control.
              (A beat. As a friend.)
          These are not the nineties anymore.

Jake storms away. Riggan heads toward his dressing room. Out
of nowhere, Mike barrels into him, pinning him against a wall.RIGGAN(Startled.)
          Holy Fuck!

Mike presses up against Riggan, breathing down his neck. After a
painful silence...MIKE(Like he's possessed.)
          You were good...RIGGANMeet me in front of the theater in
          10 minutes.

Mike chuckles and slaps Riggan gently on the face before he
disappears into his dressing room. Riggan begins walking
again. We follow him into...10/29/14   /   36.14   INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS             14...his dressing room. He goes into the bathroom and quickly
     washes his face.SYLVIA (O.S.)What the hell was going on up there?

     We pan over to see his ex-wife Sylvia (43), standing in one
     corner, staring at Riggan. She is elegant and simply beautiful.RIGGANI didn't know you were here tonight.SYLVIAThat guy's an asshole, huh?

     Riggan dries his hands with a towel and comes out of the
     bathroom.RIGGANWhat are you doing here?SYLVIASam and I are going to grab a bite
               after she's finished with--RIGGANNo, I mean here. Now.SYLVIAWell. I know how much this means to
               you, so--RIGGANI appreciate that.

     A beat.SYLVIASo, how's it going?RIGGANThe play?SYLVIANo, you and Sam.RIGGANIt's good. (A beat.) It's the same.SYLVIADo you talk to her?(CONTINUED)10/29/14    /   37.RIGGANWe talk. We-- I don't know, it's been crazy
          around here.SYLVIAYou understand where her head is at right
          now.RIGGANOf course.SYLVIAShe's trying to stay away from everything
          and everyone that got her into rehab in the
          first place, but...RIGGAN...I know, Sylvia...SYLVIA...But that's all she had. So she's--RIGGANI really do get it.SYLVIAI know you're caught up in all this stuff,

          Riggan... You don't have to be a great
          father right now, you just have to be one.RIGGANYeah.
Suddenly, Laura opens the door and sticks her head in.LAURA(Noticing Sylvia.)
          Oh, sorry.

She closes the door. Awkward silence.SYLVIASo how is that going? Is she and
          Sam--?RIGGANI don't wanna talk about it.(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /    38.He goes to a small fridge, takes out a beer and closes it.SYLVIAYou're drinking?RIGGANI'm having a beer.SYLVIAOkay...
He sits and sips in silence for a moment. Then he begins to
take out the wig.RIGGANSo, what's going on with you?SYLVIAMe? Nothing. Everything's the same I guess.
          I'm going back to teaching.RIGGANI'm thinking about refinancing the Malibu
          house.SYLVIAWh-- I'm sorry?RIGGANI'm thinking about--SYLVIANo, I heard you. I just need a second to--
          (A beat.) That's gonna be Sam's house. Why
          would you-- (A beat.) What? For this play?RIGGAN(Honest and vulnerable.)
          I need the money.SYLVIADo you have any idea how crazy that sounds?RIGGANWhat do you want me to say? My health
          lasted longer than the money... Go figure
          that out.

Riggan seems pensive and lost.SYLVIARiggan...
              (Beat.)
          What's going on?... Look at me.(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   39.Riggan gently looks up to Sylvia.RIGGANI have a chance to do something right. And I
          have to take it. I have to.SYLVIAIt's funny. I was sitting here waiting
          for you, and all of a sudden I couldn't
          remember why we broke up.
Silence. Then, as if he hasn't heard what she said.RIGGANThe last time I flew here from LA, George
          Clooney was sitting two seats in front of
          me. With those cuff links, and that...
          chin. We ended up flying through this
          really bad storm. The plane started to
          rattle and shake, and everyone on board
          was crying... and praying. And I just sat
          there-- Sat there thinking that when Sam
          opened that paper it was going to be
          Clooney's face on the front page. Not
          mine. (A beat.) Did you know that Farrah
          Fawcett died on the same day as Michael
          Jackson?

She smiles sadly. She kisses him on the head and goes to the
door.RIGGAN (CONT'D)Why did we break up?SYLVIA(Looks him in the eye.)
          You threw a kitchen knife at me...

Riggan is smacked by that memory. His eyes on the floor.SYLVIA (CONT'D)...and one hour later you were
          telling me how much you loved me.
              (Beat.)
          Just because I didn't like that
          ridiculous comedy you did with Goldie
          Hawn didn't mean I did not love you.
          But that's what you always do. You
          confuse love with admiration.

She smiles sadly. He looks at her. As Sylvia opens the door,
she turns back to Riggan...(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   40.SYLVIA (CONT'D)It's your house, so do what you want with

               daughter.RIGGANI will.SYLVIAYou're not Farrah Fawcett, Riggan.
     She exits. Painful silence... until...BIRDMAN (V.O.)We should have done that reality show they
               offered us. "The Thomsons." That would've
               been good. Crazy, druggy, wise ass daughter.
               Milfy wife with the perky tits. People would
               have watched that.RIGGAN(To the poster.)
               Shut up.

     Riggan stands up and grabs his jacket. He opens the door and
     goes out to...15   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                           15...the hallway.BIRDMAN (V.O.)Where are we goin'?RIGGAN(Almost whispering.)
               Leave me alone.

     Riggan walks between crew members. Annie interrupts him.ANNIEThe sun bed is here.RIGGANWhat does that mean?ANNIEIt means there's a sun bed out there
               being delivered to in here.RIGGANWho ordered a sun bed?(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   41.ANNIEMike. He says it's for his character.

               land". Part of his process and that
               shit.

     Riggan cannot deal with this right now. He continues walking
     until he arrives at a metal door that takes him out to...16   EXT. AN ALLEY WAY - OUTSIDE THE THEATER - CONTINUOUS           16...an alley way. Riggan walks toward the street. There is a man
     playing drums. Riggan finds Mike leaning against a parked car,
     dazed and looking up at the marquis...RIGGANLet's go. Walk.

     Riggan begins to walk, Mike follows.MIKEWhere are we going?RIGGANTo get you some coffee. Have I done
               anything to disrespect you?MIKENot yet.RIGGANI have a lot riding on this play.MIKEIs that right?RIGGANPeople know who I am, and--MIKEBullshit.RIGGANMike--MIKEBullshit. People don't know you. They
               know the guy in the bird suit. They
               know the guy who tells those quaint,

          just the slutty little cousin of prestige.RIGGANOkay, I don't even know what that--MIKEMy reputation is riding on this play.
          And that's... That is...RIGGANA lot?MIKEA lot. Exactly. Fuck you. Yes. This
          doesn't work out for you, you get to go
          home to your studio pals and jump right
          back into that cultural genocide you
          guys are perpetrating. "There's a
          douchbag born every minute". That was
          P.T. Barnum's premise when he got rich
          inventing the circus. And you and your
          pals know nothing's changed, and
          whatever toxic shit you make people are
          still gonna pay to see it. But, after
          you're gone, I'll still be here. I'll
          still be making my living on the stage.
          Baring my soul. Wrestling with emotions,
          complex emotions.RIGGANRight. Is that what tonight was about then?
          (Mocking him.) Wrestling with "complex
          emotions"?MIKETonight was about making it alive. About
          making it bleed. This isn't the Warner
          Brothers lot, Riggan. This is the city, and
          this is how we do things.

Mike turns and opens the front door of The Rum House.RIGGANWhere are you going?MIKEThey have coffee in here.

He walks into the restaurant. Riggan backtracks and we follow
him into...10/29/14   /   43.17   INT. RUM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS                                   17...The Rum House. Mike stands at the bar, the bartender

     Mike points to an Older Woman sitting at the bar. She sips a
     martini and scribbles in a notebook with a sour expression.MIKE (CONT'D)You see that woman over there? The one that
               looks like she just licked a homeless guy's

          And, to be honest, nobody gives a shit about
          you around here.LADY (O.S.)You're Riggan Thompson, right?

Two fat tourists in "Mamma Mia" t-shirts, with a seven year old
kid, approach the table.HUSBAND(Timidly.)
          We're sorry to interrupt...LADYWould you mind terribly if we got a
          picture?RIGGANOf course. It's no trouble at all.

The Lady shoves her camera into Mike's hands.LADY(To Mike.)
          Would you mind?

Mike gets up with a blank expression and takes the camera.
The Lady pushes the kid into the booth next to Riggan.LADY (CONT'D)(Ordering Mike.)
          The button right on top there.KIDWho is this guy?LADY(To his son.)
          Come on, Billy. He used to be like Batman.

She yanks the kid closer and they squeeze up against Riggan.
Mike takes the photo and holds the camera to the lady.LADY (CONT'D)(To Mike)
          I think you screwed that one up. Take
          another one.

She kisses Riggan hard on the mouth. Then gets up, giddy, and
takes her son by the hand. As the couple leaves, husband shoves
a five dollar bill into Mike's hands.HUSBANDWe really appreciate it.
An agitated Mike takes a sip of whiskey.MIKEAre we good here? Cause I'm gonna go.RIGGANSee you tomorrow.

Mike places the dollar under one of the shot glasses and begins
to walk away, but then stops and turns curiously.MIKEWhy Raymond Carver? You never told me.

Riggan looks at Mike for a second, than reaches for his wallet
and produces an old cocktail napkin with some writing on it. He
slides it to Mike.RIGGANA long time ago, I did a play back in
          high school in Michigan. He was in the
          audience. He sent this backstage after.MIKE"Thank you for an honest performance. Ray
          Carver." What is this?

Riggan looks vulnerable. He is trying to make Mike understand
the importance of the napkin, to build a bridge between them.RIGGANAnd that's when I knew I was going to
          be an actor.

Mike can't stop himself from smiling.RIGGAN (CONT'D)Why is that funny?MIKEHe wrote it on a cocktail napkin.(CONTINUED)10/29/14     /    46.RIGGANSo...

     Mike smiles and waves over to an obviously nervous Riggan. He
     goes toward the exit, but we stay with Tabitha, scribbling on
     her notebook. Suddenly she raises her eyes and, with a dark
     expression, looks at Riggan who is passing by.

     We follow Riggan toward the exit. Through the window we see him
     leave the restaurant. Then we pan to a wooden wall, and this
     wall takes us to...19   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - LATER                               19...the theater hallway. Riggan walks through the quiet corridor,

               people began to forget who was inside the
               bird costume. You're doing a play based on
               a book that was written 60 years ago, for
               a thousand rich, old white people whose
               only real concern is gonna be where they
               go to have their cake and coffee when it's
               over. Nobody gives a shit but you. And
               let's face it, Dad, it's not for the sake
               of art. It's because you just want to feel
               relevant again. Well, there's a whole
               world out there where people fight to be
               relevant every day. And you act like it
               doesn't even exist! Things are happening
               in a place that you willfully ignore, a
               place that has already forgotten you. I
               mean who are you? You hate bloggers. You
               make fun of twitter. You don't even have a
               Facebook page. You're the one who doesn't
               exist. You're doing this because you're
               scared to death, like the rest of us, that
               you don't matter. And you know what?
               You're right. You don't. It's not
               important. You're not important. Get used

     Silence. Riggan seems devastated, and Sam can see that.

     She looks at him sympathetically, but not knowing what to
     say... exits.

     After a moment Riggan gets up and heads for the trash can. He
     digs out the roach, grabs some matches and lights it. Music
     begins to sound. He inhales deeply and holds the smoke for a
     few seconds and finally exhales. He coughs, tosses away the
     joint and heads out of the kitchen. We follow him...21   INT. HALLWAY - THEATRE - CONTINUOUS                            21...as he slowly walks until he disappears into the darkness of
     the corridor. We keep moving forward until we end up...10/29/14   /    51.A21   INT. BACKSTAGE - THEATRE - EVENING                          A21...backstage. We are in the middle of the second preview. The
      music continues, it belongs to the play.

      Laura is by herself on stage performing the end of a scene. She
      stands in the middle of a surrealistic forest set, at dusk.
      There is fog, and trees. A strong, artificial wind blows
      through Laura's hair. Desolate music.LAURA(To the audience as soliloquy.)
                In the days before Nick's depression really
                started to eat away at him, he had no idea
                I was pregnant. And I never intended on
                telling him. I guess we make choices in
                life, and we choose to live with them. Or
                not. I didn't want that baby...

      Three dancers on stage pass by in front of Laura. We follow
      the dancers backstage where we find Mike and Lesley wearing
      pajamas.LAURA (O.S.) (CONT'D)...Not because I didn't love Nick. And not
                because I didn't love the-- The idea of
                it. But because I just wasn't ready to
                love myself. There's a certain distance to
                it all now. A wistful distance.
                Underscored by a gentle breeze and the
                sound of the birds... laughing at the
                whimsy of it all.

      A stage hand helps Mike and Lesley into a double bed. The
      camera slips under the covers with them and stays there.MIKE(Whispering.)
                Hey, Les...LESLEY(Whispering.)
                What?MIKEI'm hard.LESLEYNo, you're not. It's just that sometimes
                you don't consider other people's feelings.MIKENo. I'm hard. Feel.(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   52.LESLEYOh, you gotta be kidding.

     The stage begins to revolve as we hear...22   INT. STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            22...music through the transition. It remains dark.MIKELet's really do this. Let's fuck.LESLEYAre you crazy? No.

     Mike rolls on top of Lesley.LESLEY (CONT'D)Cut it out...

     Mike continues to maneuver himself.LESLEY (CONT'D)I'm serious, Mike. Stop!MIKEI'm Mel. Not Mike. Mel.
     A knock on a door.RIGGAN (O.S.)Terri! Terri!

     A furious Lesley tries to reposition herself under Mike.RIGGAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)Terri! I know you're in there!

     The knocking gets louder.RIGGAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)Terri???

     Mike, lost in his libido, has begun to have sex with Lesley.
     The camera comes out from under the covers and pans to Riggan
     who stumbles into what is now the Motel Room set. He wears a
     mustache and a long wig, that makes him look like a wild man.
     He holds a gun in his right hand. A neon "Motel" sign is
     illuminated. A clever effect of falling rain is visible behind
     the set, accompanied by the appropriate sound effect. Riggan
     is wet because of the "rain".

     Lesley uses Riggan's entrance to escape from Mike.(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   53.LESLEYEd!

Mike hops out of bed, unaware of the very noticeable erection
protruding underneath his pajama bottoms.

Some laughter from the audience.LESLEY (CONT'D)What are you doing here?
Lesley doesn't understand the audience response, until she
notices the erection herself.RIGGAN(To Lesley.)
          Why? I need you to tell me why. I lived for
          you. I worshipped you...MIKEListen Ed, I know this is hard but--
More laughter. Riggan is disturbed, but he continues...RIGGAN(to Mike)
          Fuck you. Shut up. Fuck you.

He shoves Mike violently to the floor.LESLEYEddie! Please!

Riggan points the gun at Mike's head.RIGGANWhat's wrong with me? Why do I end up
          having to beg people to love me?LESLEYEd. Eddie. Please... Give me the gun.
She begins to cry. Her performance is beautiful.LESLEY (CONT'D)Just look at me. I was drowning. I
          was not capable of-- You deserve to
          be loved. You do.RIGGANI just wanted to be what you wanted.

          be someone else. Someone I'm not. Anyone...(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   54.MIKEPut down the gun, Ed. She just doesn't love
               you anymore.

     The audience is silent.RIGGAN(A sad smile.)
               You don't, do you?LESLEY(With sympathy.)
               No...RIGGANAnd you never will...LESLEYI'm sorry.RIGGAN(A revelation.)
               I don't exist. I'm not even here. I don't
               exist. None of this matters.

     Riggan points the gun at Lesley. Then at Mike. Finally, he puts
     the gun to his own head and pulls the trigger. PUM! And with the
     explosion, a fake blood mechanism splatters brains onto the
     stage. Riggan drops to the floor.

     A blackout. The audience applauds politely. The curtain falls.
     We follow Riggan off stage and into...23   INT. BACKSTAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                       23...the wings, where Annie immediately helps him remove the
     bloody and wet wig with the propeller mechanism. Laura waits
     next to them for their bows. Meanwhile, a stage hand crosses
     behind them, and we follow him as he goes on stage to...24   INT. STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                           24...reposition some scenery for the curtain call. The camera
     carries us to the other side of the stage, where Mike and Lesley
     are in a heated exchange...MIKEJust, keep your voice down...LESLEY(Furious.)
               You have to be shitting me. You can't get it
               up in six months...(MORE)(CONTINUED)10/29/14     /   55.LESLEY (CONT'D)(She starts hitting him.)
          ...and now you try to fuck me in front of
          eight hundred strangers???MIKEWhat do you want from me? I have to feel it.
          You know that. I told you that from the--LESLEYOh, fuck you...
Music begins and the curtain rises. The audience applauds as
Lesley and Mike stride onto the stage and take their bows,
smiles plastered on their faces.MIKE...I was in the moment...LESLEYI told you to stop. You fucking animal.MIKEBut... You were incredible.LESLEYWhat is wrong with you?

Lesley starts back for the wings, and Mike follows her. In the
background we see Riggan and Laura enter from the other side to
take their bows.MIKEListen I'm sorry, alright, I--LESLEYI want your shit out of the apartment.

They go back on stage and join Riggan and Laura for the company
bow.MIKECan we--LESLEYNo we can't. Maybe up here you're Mr. Truth,
          Mike. But in the real world, where it counts,
          you're a fraud. How's that for truth? You...
          dick.

Lesley storms off, leaving Mike and a confused Riggan on stage.
Laura chases her off and straight into...10/29/14   /   56.25   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                           25...the hallway.LAURAWhat's going on?LESLEYHe's an asshole.LAURAWhat did he do now?LESLEYOh, nothing. He just tried to fuck me in
               front of a full house.LAURAOh, my God...LESLEYRight?LAURAThat's kind of hot.

     She follows Lesley into...26   INT. LESLEY AND LAURA'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS26...the dressing room and closes the door. Lesley proceeds to
     smash everything on her dressing table. Then she looks in the
     mirror holding a hairbrush.LESLEYWhy don't I have any self-respect?LAURAYou're an actress, honey.

     Lesley begins to cry. Laura hugs her.LESLEYI'm pathetic. You know, I've dreamt of
               being a Broadway actress since I was a
               little kid. And now I'm here. And I'm not a
               Broadway actress. I'm still just a little
               kid. And I keep waiting for someone to tell
               me I made it.LAURA(Hiding how moved she is.)
               Hey. You made it.(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   57.LESLEYI did?LAURASadly, it was with Mike Shiner, on a fake

          Shut. Up.
Riggan steps into the doorway and sees Laura hugging Lesley.RIGGANIs she okay?LAURAShe's gonna be fine.

Riggan enters gingerly and walks up to Lesley.RIGGANNone of this is your fault.

          lucky to have you. Okay?LESLEYOkay.RIGGANOkay.

Riggan leaves the room. Laura leans on the makeup table.LESLEYThat was very sweet.LAURAYeah.
Laura is suddenly teary.LESLEYWhat's wrong?

     Laura smiles and caresses Lesley's hand. They look at each
     other. Then Laura leans forward, close to Lesley's face...LESLEY (CONT'D)(Nervous.)
               What are you doing?LAURANothing.
     Laura kisses Lesley tenderly on the lips. Lesley seems
     confused. A few seconds of silence. Then...LESLEYDo it again.

     Laura kisses her again. A knock at the door. They separate.
     Mike opens the door holding the prop gun.MIKE(To Lesley.)

     Lesley hurls the hair brush at his head.LESLEYFUCK YOU!!!MIKEOkay, well, you're not ready.
     Mike points the prop gun at her, pretends to fire and...MIKE (CONT'D)That was hot.

     He exits the room. We follow him...27   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                          27...down the hallway up to Riggan's dressing room. Riggan sits
     at his table, picking the brains out of his hair.(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   59.MIKE(Holding the gun.)
               Your gun is ridiculous. It looks like a
               plastic toy. And it still has the red plug
               in the barrel.
                   (Shows the plug.)
               You look like a seven year old when
               you're holding it. I'm not threatened

     He tosses the gun onto Riggan's table.MIKE (CONT'D)Have some self respect and get a new one.
                   (Takes a step then turns.)
               That was a fun crowd, huh?

     We follow Mike to...28   INT. STAIRS - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                          28...the stairs. He climbs them as he lights a cigarette. He goes
     through a metal door that takes him out onto...29   EXT. ROOFTOP - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                         29...a rooftop. The Marquis' of the other theaters glowing with
     the street lamps, a classic Broadway view.

     Mike is surprised to find Sam sitting on the cornice of the
     building, a good fifty feet above 45th street. He goes next to
     her, looking down at the street.MIKEI don't think it's high enough.

      room window. We push in to find...30    INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - DAY                  30...Riggan siting with his feet on the window frame, staring at
      a manila envelope in his hands that reads... "R, MALIBU
      REFINANCE DOCS. SIGN AND SEND ASAP. J." Riggan sighs and props
      the letter up against the mirror.

      With a soft knock, Laura enters. She stands in the doorway with
      an odd expression on her face.RIGGANWhat now?
      Laura lays the Arts section of the New York Times down in front
      of Riggan.LAURADon't kill the messenger.

      Riggan picks up the paper. His expression immediately changes.
      Laura watches him sympathetically.LAURA (CONT'D)He's an asshole.

      Now we see the cover of the Arts section. There is a picture
      of Mike lounging on a black sofa, his bare feet on a table as
      he sips a glass of wine. The Title of the article reads...
      "CARVING OUT HIS PLACE IN THEATER HISTORY. Shiner says Raymond
      Carver is the reason he became an actor." Riggan involuntarily
      squeezes the paper as he reads on, filling with rage.BIRDMAN (V.O.)He's fooling you.(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   65.RIGGANShut up.LAURA(Confused.)

Riggan searches desperately for page twelve. When he gets
there, he finds a huge ad of the new Toyota Camry that almost
fills the entire page, and down in the left corner a tiny
press release with the title:

     She charges to the door and is about to leave when she turns
     back to Riggan...LAURA (CONT'D)By the way... I'm not pregnant. So there's
               one thing you don't have to worry about.

     She leaves, slamming the door behind her.

     Riggan remains still. Mike seems to be smirking at him right
     through the cover of the Arts section...BIRDMAN (V.O.)That pretentious, little, theater fuck is
               stealing your thunder.

     Riggan charges out of the room and into...31   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                          31...the hallway. He walks to Mike's dressing room, finds the
     door half opened and enters...32   INT. MIKE'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS             32...discovering Mike lying in a sun bed. His arm is sticking
     out of it, holding on to a copy of Borges's 'Labyrinths'.

     sun goggles. Riggan slams the lid down on him.(CONTINUED)10/29/14     /   67.MIKEWhat the fuck is going on!RIGGANGet up!MIKEBack away.RIGGANGet up.

               Mike? Is it really true?

     Riggan stares intensely into Mike's eyes. Mike looks away.(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   69.RIGGAN (CONT'D)Because my father was. My father was a mean
          fucking drunk. Beat the shit out of us. But
          we were okay with the beatings. You know
          why? Because at least when he was beating
          us, he wasn't thinking about taking us out
          to his tool shed...

Mike's expression changes.RIGGAN (CONT'D)That sonofabitch would smile and say, "Do
          you want to kneel down and unbuckle my
          belt? Or do you want me to take it off and
          use it?" I learned how to make myself numb.
          But my sister-- (Holding back tears.) My
          little sister...

Riggan can't go on. Mike is horrified.MIKEJesus, Riggan. I'm really sorry. I
          didn't-- That's fucking horrible...RIGGAN(Crazy smile.)
          Yeah. It's also not true. See? (Cracking
          up.) I can pretend too, you little dick!

Riggan shoves Mike violently.RIGGAN (CONT'D)Don't fuck with me, Mike.MIKEYou're crazy...RIGGANYou have no idea what I'm capable of. You
          understand me?
Riggan pulls the paper out of his back pocket.RIGGAN (CONT'D)Working with Riggan Thomson is like
          waltzing with a monkey?

He smacks Mike in the head with the paper and begins to jump in
front of him, ready to fight.RIGGAN (CONT'D)Let's go. Put your hands up.(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   70.MIKE(Tauntingly.)
               Don't you want to go put on your tights and
               your--

     Riggan punches him on the face. Mike needs a few seconds to
     understand what has just happened. Then they begin to wrestle
     in the hallway. Mike breaks free from the headlock.MIKE (CONT'D)What are you gonna do? You gonna get rid of
               me? Huh? What do you think my friend
               Tabitha is going to write in the Times
               after you get rid of me?

     Riggan stares at Mike, paralyzed by the truth. Finally, he
     turns and marches to his dressing room, and we follow him...34   INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS             34...Riggan slams the door shut and paces in a rage. He glares at
     a make-up box on the table and, points his finger at it, and
     sends it flying across the room.BIRDMAN (V.O.)You are lame, Riggan. Rolling around
               with that third rate actor in an 800
               seat shithole like this.RIGGAN(Whispering.)
               Breathing in, I feel my rage. Breathing
               out, I embrace my mental formations.BIRDMAN (V.O.)You're going to let that poncey theater
               fuck threaten you?

     Riggan continues breathing deeply with his eyes tightly closed.
     He smiles a tiny artificial smile.RIGGAN(Whispering.)
               Breathing in, I am calm. Breathing out,
               I ignore my mental formations. This is a
               mental formation. This is a mental form--BIRDMAN (V.O.)Stop that shit. I am not a mental
               formation. I am "you", asshole.

     Riggan looks down at the poster on the floor.(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   71.RIGGAN(Whispering.)
          Leave me alone.BIRDMAN (V.O.)You were a movie star, remember?
          Pretentious, but happy...

Riggan opens his eyes, slowly. A sad expression on his face.RIGGANI was not happy.BIRDMAN...Ignorant but charming. Now you are a
          tiny bitter cocksucker.RIGGANShut up! Stop whining! I was miserable!BIRDMAN (V.O.)Yeah. But fake miserable. Hollywood
          miserable.

Riggan points his fingers at a lamp and sends it flying.BIRDMAN (V.O.)What are you trying to prove? Huh? That
          you're an artist? You're not.RIGGANFuck you!

Riggan points his fingers at a chair and sends it flying.BIRDMAN (V.O.)Fuck you, coward! And fuck those critics
          that made you quit. Our franchise
          grossed billions worldwi--RIGGANAnd billions of flies eat shit everyday!
          So what? Does that make it good? (Beat.)
          And I don't know if you've noticed, but
          that was 1992! Look at me! (He takes off
          his shirt.) This is what's left!
          (Grabbing his neck.) This! (Grabbing his
          chest.) This! (Totally exploding.) I'm
          fucking disappearing! I'm the answer to a
          fucking trivial pursuit question.

Riggan sits down, exhausted.(CONTINUED)10/29/14    /   72.RIGGAN (CONT'D)What part of that don't you get? You're
               fucking dead.BIRDMAN (V.O.)We are not dead. We're--RIGGANStop saying 'we'! There is no 'we'. I am
               not you. I'm Riggan fucking Thomson.BIRDMAN (V.O.)No. You're Birdman. Because without me, all
               that's left is "you". A sad, selfish,
               mediocre actor, grasping--

     Riggan points his finger and sends the poster flying, spearing
     it on a coat rack, piercing Birdman right through the heart.
     Finally, silence. Until...BIRDMAN (V.O.)What the hell did you do that for? I liked
               that poster.

     A confused Riggan looks over to the wall, where the lamp on the
     floor is creating a shadow of his figure. Only in the shadow, it
     appears as if Riggan is wearing the Birdman costume. Stunned,
     Riggan slowly lifts one arm and in the shadow we see a wing.BIRDMAN (V.O.)It's always 'we' brother.

     The television turns on by itself, playing an episode of the
     original Birdman cartoon. Riggan points his fingers at the tv
     and sends it hurling at the shadow. Then he proceeds to
     destroy everything in his room with his telekinetic powers.

     We slowly pan to see that, behind Riggan, Jake stands on the
     other side of the half-opened door. We push in on Jake,
     watching in shock. The camera turns and becomes Jake's POV...35   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                          35...and now, from his view, we see Riggan yelling at the shadow.RIGGANFuck you! Fuck you!

     He picks up a chair and throws it down. He then picks up the
     newspaper from the floor and tossing it all around. And now we
     understand that he is not using telepathy. He has been using
     only his hands. Completely mad. As Riggan turns to pick up
     something else, he spots Jake on the other side of the door. He
     immediately calms himself and walks over.(CONTINUED)10/29/14    /   73.RIGGAN (CONT'D)What's up?JAKEUm... Well. Two hours to curtain. Why don't
          you rest a little bit?RIGGANYeah. Sure.JAKELast preview, buddy. We're almost there.RIGGANOkay.JAKEHow ya doin?RIGGANGood. Great.JAKEGood. That's good.
              (A beat.)
          The, uh, money came through. I just have to
          transfer it to the account.RIGGANOh, that's terrific...JAKEOkay. Well, I'm gonna do that.
              (He stares at Riggan who
               seems about to collapse.)
          You know I'm proud of you, right? This took
          balls. And you did it.

Riggan nods. An exhausted sadness in his eyes.RIGGANI can't do this anymore, Jake.JAKEWhat?RIGGANI think I'm gonna cancel the
          preview. I'm exhausted.JAKEIt's a joke, right? (He forces a
          laugh.) Good one, Riggan.(CONTINUED)10/29/14    /   74.RIGGANI'm starting to believe that this is not
          for me. The applause is... lukewarm. I
          think they're laughing at me.JAKEWhat are you--? Listen. There's a three
          block line of people waiting to see you.
          We are sold out. It's a full house.RIGGANReally?JAKEYes. And the French embassador is
          coming. And the prince of Saudi Arabia,
          with one of his wives. And... I wasn't
          going to tell you this, but-- Martin
          Scorsese. He's casting for his new
          film. But don't tell anyone, okay? This
          is between you and me.RIGGANOkay. I'll be ready.

Riggan smiles. He has forgotten about his existential doubts.
A worried Jake closes the door. He walks a few steps and
finds Laura and Lesley. They've been listening to his
conversation with Riggan.LESLEYHow is he?JAKEHe'll be okay.LESLEYPoor creature.LAURAIs it true? Scorsese?JAKEYes. And the new Pope too.
              (Beat.)

They both understand.LAURAYou're an asshole, Jake.JAKEI'm the one keeping this boat afloat.(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   75.LESLEYSo there is no line of people out there?JAKEI don't know. Now go and get ready.
          That's your job.
              (He begins to walk.)
          I'll better invest in a taco truck, or
          a strip joint near the airport.

Laura leaves. We follow Lesley up to Riggan's dressing room.
She knocks on the door. Nothing. Silence. She half-opens the
door and, from behind her, we see Riggan examining his right
hand. He has blood falling from the palm to the wrist.LESLEYAre you okay?RIGGAN(Smiles.)
          Yeah, I-- This is nothing. Shaving.
He cleans his hand against his trousers.LESLEYI just want to say I'm sorry.RIGGANFor what?LESLEYI knew what Mike was capable of,
          and I brought him in, anyway.RIGGANYou did good.

Lesley nods. A beat.LESLEYTomorrow's my first opening night
          on Broadway.RIGGANMine too.LESLEYAnd I want you to know that,
          whatever happens, I'll always be
          grateful to you for that.RIGGANMe too. It's going to be great. Full
          house.(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   76.She looks at him with tender eyes. Then we follow her along
     the corridor until she passes by Mike's dressing room. Mike
     half-opens the door and sees Lesley walking by. He has a
     black eye. He waits for Lesley to be completely gone, and
     then he comes out of his dressing room and we follow him up
     the stairs to...38   EXT. ROOFTOP - THEATER - DUSK                                  38...the rooftop. He finds Sam standing on the cornice, looking
     at the street.MIKEFor fuck's sake, just jump already.

     Sam stares out, a smile creeping over her face.SAMHow did you know I'd be up here?MIKEI didn't. I was just hoping.

     Silence. Mike walks up next to her and stares out as well.SAMWhere's Lesley?MIKEMoving on.SAMSmart girl...MIKEI appreciate that.

                   (After a beat.)
               I'm sort of hoping it was Lesley.

     understands.(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   77.SAM (CONT'D)Oh, don't tell me...

Sam is surprised by the question. She thinks for a moment.SAMHe was never around, so...MIKEThat was--?SAMNo. That was-- Who gives a shit. It

               you're sort of this really great mess, a

               amount of booze or pills is gonna hide
               that.

     Sam tosses Mike's cigarette over the balcony, and kisses him.
     He leans into the kiss.MAN'S VOICE(From below.)

     she gets to the door she stops and leans on the frame.SAM (CONT'D)Truth or dare?MIKETruth.SAMNo.MIKETruth.SAMNo. Truth or dare?

     The slightest smile as she exits through the door, and after a
     short pause, Mike follows...39   INT. HALLWAYS - THEATRE - CONTINUOUS                         39...along a darkened hallway. They reach a tiny wooden door and
     Sam leads the way through it.MIKEDo you have any idea where you're going?SAMAbsolutely not.(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   79.She continues on until she gets to...40   INT. ABOVE STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                      40...the "grid" above stage where the lights are located. We can
     see, below us, the empty seats of the auditorium and the
     kitchen set.MIKEWhat now...?

     Mike reaches up to kiss her. She stops him.SAMHow do you do it?MIKEWhat?SAMHow do you go out there and pretend to be
               someone else in front of all those people?MIKEI don't pretend. Not out there. Just about

     They stare at one another...MIKEWhat are we doing here?SAMWhat do you mean?MIKEI mean, what are we doing here?

     She moves in.SAMAdrenaline...
     They kiss. The camera begins to drift down toward the stage...RIGGAN (O.S.)Fucking teenager.

     As the camera continues down from the grid, we discover an
     auditorium full of people staring at the actors on stage.(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   80.RIGGAN (O.S) (CONT'D)By the time I got to the hospital, the
          kid was dead. He was off in a corner
          laid out on a gurney. We took the old
          couple up to the O.R.. They were a
          mess. We worked like hell on them for
          most of the night...

We pan along the auditorium back to the stage to find Riggan,
Mike, Lesley and Laura in the kitchen.RIGGAN (CONT'D)When we were done, we wrapped them in
          full body casts. The husband was
          depressed. Even when I told him his
          wife was gonna pull through, he was
          still depressed. So, I got up to his
          mouth hole and asked him, and he told
          me it was because he couldn't see her
          through the eye holes. Can you imagine?
          I'm telling you, the man's heart was
          breaking because he couldn't turn his
          goddamn head and see his goddamn wife.LESLEY(In genuine tears.)
          That's terrible. (Beat.) Perfect.
          And terrible.

She is crushed. Laura holds Lesley, trying to control her own
emotion.RIGGAN(Taking this in.)
          Yeah. So I guess what we have to
          ask ourselves is... What do we talk
          about when we talk about love?

The lights go to a blackout and the audience applauds as some
scene change music plays. As we follow Riggan off stage, the
lights are turned on again, but now they have an orange mood.
Lesley is the only one on stage, doing a monologue.LESLEYMel and I have been together five
          years, been married for four. But
          it was Ed who taught me something
          no one else could... He taught me
          what it felt like to really feel
          loved. And the terrible thing is
          that if something happened to Mel
          or myself, if something happened to
          either one of us tomorrow, I think
          the other one would grieve for a
          while, you know, but then would go(MORE)(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   81.LESLEY (CONT'D)out and love again, have someone
           else soon enough. All this-- All of

           would just be a memory. Maybe not
           even a memory. Am I wrong? I mean,
           I don't know anything. And I'm the
           first one to admit it.

A Dresser waits in the wings to help Riggan with his change.DRESSERThat was amazing!

Riggan looks proud. Things are finally going well. He undresses
to his underwear and puts on a robe and his moccasins, as the
stage begins to revolve. Laura, in costume, walks up beside
him. Over the following dialogue, the kitchen gives way to the
extravagant garden set we saw before.LAURA(A bit distant.)
           It's actually going well.RIGGANYeah. (A beat.) Hey. I think we have to
           talk.LAURA(Sad smile.)

Riggan nods.RIGGANRight. (Beat.) We will eventually,
           though, `cause that's the only way I get
           to say I'm sorry. I really am.

               disagree.

     The lights come up and Laura walks onto the stage.LAURA (CONT'D)(Back to him.)
               You were right. This was fun.
     Riggan watches her go, but something else grabs his attention.
     We pan across the stage to see Sam and Mike on the other side.
     They talk and laugh. Sam kisses Mike softly. Mike playfully
     grabs her ass.

     We pan back to Riggan. His expression morphs from broken-
     hearted to rage. He marches over to a stage hand.RIGGANYou have a cigarette?

     The stage hand holds out a pack, Riggan takes one.STAGE HANDYou need a light?

     Riggan snatches the lighter and storms out through the hallway,
     and out the back door of the theater to...41   EXT. AN ALLEY WAY - OUTSIDE THE THEATER - CONTINUOUS         41...the alley. Down at the end, we can see the tourists making
     their way about the streets. Riggan lights the cigarette and
     leans back against the stage door trying to calm himself.RIGGANBreathing in, I calm myself. Breathing out,
               I ease myself.

     But this is New York City. A fluorescent light buzzes above his
     head. Taxis honk their horns. The sound of pedestrians yelling
     at one another. All fueling his agitation.
     Riggan checks his watch. He pulls one last drag from the
     cigarette before he tosses it, and turns to head back in, only
     to realize the door has locked. He tries to pull it open to no
     avail. He begins to knock loudly on the door. There is no
     response. He knocks louder. Nothing.

     He is turning to walk away when he realizes that his robe is
     caught in the door. He checks his watch again and now is
     beginning to panic. He tries to tear at the robe but the terry
     cloth is too strong for him to rip. Frantically, he looks around
     for an answer. No answer. No time. He pulls the robe off of him(CONTINUED)10/29/14     /   83.and, wearing only his underwear and moccasins, he charges down
     the alley way toward...42   EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS                                      42...the street. Now, rushing down the block in his underwear. A
     tourist spots him.TOURISTHey, aren't you...?RIGGANI'm sorry. I can't really--TOURISTRiggan Thompson! Holy Shit! Let me get an
               autograph.

     Riggan marches on as a few more people begin to notice. The
     Tourist runs in front of him, forcing him to stop.TOURIST (CONT'D)Come on, man. Don't be a dick. Let me have
               an autograph.

     The man produces a pen and a magazine from his pocket. More
     people begin to gather...MAN ON STREETBirdman!

     Seeing no other way out, Riggan signs the autograph.TOURISTDude! You fuckin' rock!

     Directly in front of him stand a lady and her two kids.LADYCan we take one picture?RIGGANAre you kidding me?KID #1Why is he naked?LADYOne picture...KID #2I can see his weenie.(CONTINUED)10/29/14     /   84.Riggan tries to get past them, but a crowd has formed. A swarm

     Riggan shoves the old lady aside and enters...44   INT. AUDITORIUM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                       44...the theater. Riggan stands in the back among the audience.
     He sees the "rain" falling on the stage. The "Motel" sign is
     lit. Mike and Lesley are in bed, for the motel scene, waiting
     for the knock on the door. With nothing else to do, Riggan
     yells his line from the back of the auditorium...RIGGANKnock knock knock! Terri! Terri!

     The audience turns to see Riggan standing in his underwear.
     They begin to murmur and laugh and point at him.
     Riggan marches down the aisle. He looks haggard and covered
     with perspiration.

     Lesley and Mike, confused, come out of bed.LESLEYEd! What are you doing here?RIGGANWhy? I need you to tell me why. I lived for
               you-- I worshipped you...MIKEListen Ed, I know this is hard but--RIGGANFuck you. Shut up. Fuck you.

     Giggles from the audience. Riggan turns threateningly and points
     to an audience member on the aisle who is giggling at him.RIGGAN (CONT'D)Shut up!

     The guy stops smiling. The audience goes silent. Riggan arrives
     at the apron of the stage. Annie from the wings slides the gun
     towards him. Riggan grabs it and points it at Mike.(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   86.LESLEYEddie! Please!

     Riggan climbs onto the stage. Exhausted. He goes to Mike and,
     with a last effort, pushes him lamely.RIGGANWhat's wrong with me? Why do I end
               up having to beg people to love me?LESLEYEd. Eddie. Please... Give me the gun.

     We pan to the wings where Jake is staring in disbelief. His
     cellphone begins to vibrate, and he answers.JAKEYeah. (A beat.) What?... No no no no no no
               no. Wait there. I'm coming out in--

     He walks toward the hallway and we follow him...45   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            45...through the corridor.JAKENo. Wait. Wait for me. I'll be there in a

     He goes out one of the exits and we are left with the silence of
     the empty hallway. After a few seconds, the sound of the gunshot
     from the scene echoes through the theater. The audience
     applauds. The camera starts to move forward. A few seconds later
     Riggan takes over the POV with his bloody long wig and the fake
     gun. We follow up to...46   INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS             46...his dressing room. He puts on a robe. He walks to his
     refrigerator without acknowledging Sam who is sitting on the
     couch, scribbling her dashes on the toilet paper once again.
     Riggan takes out a plastic container of bologna and a jar of
     mustard. He sits in front of his dressing table, peels open the
     bologna and opens the jar of mustard. Slice by slice, he dips
     the bologna in the mustard and shoves it into his mouth.SAMDad...?(CONTINUED)10/29/14     /   87.RIGGAN(Looking up.)

          know, at all. And I'm pretty much broke.
          Oh, and also, this play feels like a
          miniature, deformed version of myself
          that keeps following me around, hitting
          me in the balls with a tiny hammer.

black marks running along the toilet paper. She takes the last
two panels and tears them off.SAM (CONT'D)And this... (Hands them to him.) ...is

Riggan stares at the paper, and then at Sam.RIGGAN(Casually.)

face with the piece of toilet paper.SAMDad!RIGGANWhat?(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   89.Sam looks at the ruined toilet paper in his hands.RIGGAN (CONT'D)Oh... Shit. I'm sorry.SAM(Smiling.)

Riggan looks at her with the saddest of expressions.SAM (CONT'D)Dad. (She hesitates.) Do you know
          you're becoming a trending topic?RIGGANReally? What does that mean?

Sam searches for something on her iPhone and then hands it to
Riggan. Riggan looks at the phone and sees a hand-held video of
himself in the streets in his underwear.SAM350,000 views in less than an hour.
          Believe it or not, this is power.

Riggan looks at more footage, seemingly confused. After a
moment, the phone vibrates and the video is interrupted by a
text message, which reads "Truth or Dare?"RIGGANIt's for you.

She grabs the phone and looks at the screen. Then at her
father. Riggan is staring at her. She looks down.RIGGAN (CONT'D)Go ahead...SAM(Hesitant.)
          Are you...?RIGGANGo.

A sympathetic smile. An understanding. Sam exits.

Riggan stares into the mirror absently. His eyes locked on
his reflection trying to find himself in the image. Then he
spots a vase with dying roses, the same roses he flung to the
ground previously.(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   90.He gets up and goes into the bathroom. He pulls off the long
     wig and the mustache. He washes his face. Then he opens a
     small bottle and uses the liquid to scrub his goatee. The
     dark dye begins to run out, leaving only white hair. For the
     first time we see that Riggan has a white beard.

     He puts on new clothes and comes out of the bathroom. He grabs
     a beige raincoat and heads out of the dressing room and
     into...47   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            47...the hallway. As he passes by Mike's door he can hear Sam and
     Mike. They're trying to be as quiet as possible, but we can hear
     them flirting and laughing.

     He pauses for a moment but continues on. After a few seconds,
     his phone vibrates. He looks at it. A text from Jake reads:
     "Have you seen this??? Awesome!!!" He clicks the attachment and
     sees the, now infamous, video of his underwear escapade in the
     street. We zoom in until the image fills the screen, when we
     finally pull away, we discover that...48   INT. RUM HOUSE - LATER                                         48...Riggan's video is being played now in a television in the
     bar. We see the MTV logo on the bottom of the screen and a video
     caption that reads: "Birdman goes viral, 930.000 views and
     counting". The camera pans to find Riggan sitting at the bar,
     drunk. He is one of the few customers. He polishes off his
     drink.RIGGANLet me have another one.BARTENDERYou got it.

     The bartender pours another whiskey for Riggan. A waiter steps
     up to the bar. The bartender points to a martini.BARTENDER (CONT'D)(To the waiter.)
               That's going over to Ms. Dickinson.

     Riggan's head tilts at the mention of the name. He looks over to
     see Tabitha sitting at a table, scratching in her notebook.RIGGAN(Hands the waiter a bill.)

walks it over to Tabitha and places it down in front of her. Not
looking up, she pulls the drink closer and takes a sip.

Riggan sits down across from her. She looks up and immediately
recognizes him. He takes out the Carver cocktail napkin and
pushes it in front of her. She looks at him, and then down to
the napkin. She reads it in silence.RIGGAN (CONT'D)(Re: The napkin.)
          That was twenty years before I put on that
          damned costume.

      over and gulps down Tabitha's entire martini, gin pouring out

                Gravity doesn't even apply to you.

      The camera flies up with Riggan as he floats above the street.
      There is something magical in his ascension, gently impelled by
      the breeze. A beautiful backlight makes his body glow. Birdman
      flutters around him.BIRDMAN (CONT'D)Listen to me. We gotta go back! We have to
                do this. We have to end it on our terms.
                With a grand gesture.

      A strange light suddenly palpitates in Riggan's eyes. Something
      makes sense in what Birdman is telling him.

      The camera becomes Riggan's POV. He looks down to see the
      people on the street, watching him in awe.BIRDMAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)We'll go back. We'll show them how much
                they're going to miss us. Flames. Icarus.
                Sacrifice...

      We tilt up again to Riggan's face. He has a plan.BIRDMAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)Let's go back one more time and show them
                what we're capable of. You can do it.
                You're Birdman. Do you hear me? You're...A GUY'S VOICE (O.S.)Birdman!E50                                                               E50And as the camera pulls away, we discover Birdman is gone and
      Riggan is standing on the ledge of a tall building. The camera
      tilts down and we see that more people have gathered around,
      and more cars has stopped, and they all point at Riggan,
      worried about the situation.

      A guy wearing shorts, a Bob Marley t-shirt and a robe opens his
      window, one floor below Riggan, and looks up at him.GUYDude, what are you doing?

      Riggan looks down at the people on the street far below.(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   98.GUY (CONT'D)You okay, buddy? Do you want me to
          call someone?

We pan to a lady on her balcony filming Riggan with her phone.LADYIs this for real, or you're shooting a
          film?RIGGANA film.

The lady looks around but sees nothing.LADYOh, you people are full of shit.

She goes into her apartment.GUYI'm calling 911.

The guy goes inside his apartment.RIGGANOne more time...

Now, from the door of the rooftop, a good neighbor calmly
approaches Riggan.GOOD NEIGHBORHi, sir. Can I help you? You should be
          careful.RIGGANSorry. Can't talk. I'm late.
              (Murmuring.)
          Music.

Some underscoring music begins to sound. The neighbor is now
close to him and helps Riggan step down from the edge on to the
floor of the rooftop.GOOD NEIGHBORAre you alright? Do you want me to
          call someone? Do you know where to go?

Riggan closes his eyes for a moment as the camera moves slowly
toward him. He opens his eyes. The music begins to swell. Riggan
stands up straight and proud, and in a voice that sounds like
Birdman...RIGGANYes. I know where to go.(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /    99.He turns and begins to run on the rooftop. The music is rousing.
      As he runs, he holds out his arms, spreading them wide. The
      camera runs behind him, until suddenly...F50                                                                 F50Riggan jumps, and the camera jumps after him. He rapidly
      falls toward the street, toward the asphalt. But in his face
      there is no fear. No. He spreads his arms again and...G50                                                                 G50He takes flight, soaring high over Manhattan. The music becomes
      epic. There is something beautiful about this broken man flying
      like a superhero. We fly next to him, and we can see below the
      spectacular sight that is Manhattan, until...51    EXT. THEATER - CONTINUOUS                                     51...he finally lands on 45th street and calmly approaches the
      theater. An Usher acknowledges him with a look of surprise.USHERMr. Thomson. I think you forgot to--RIGGANStop the music.

      The music stops.USHERI beg your pardon?

      Riggan enters the theater.

      The confused Usher watches him go by, as he points to the
      street. We pan to see a taxi driver coming out of his car,
      running like a mad man toward us.

      We stay with the Usher and the taxi driver as they argue. They
      take it inside the lobby, but we remain out front.A51                                                                 A51Day turns to night, igniting the lights   of the marquee, which
      reflect off of the lobby doors. We hear   wild applause coming
      from inside the theater. Seconds later,   the doors of the
      theater open and the audience files out   for intermission.(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   100.MAN(Tweeting on his phone.)

          We begin to move up, outside the theater. We see the marquee of
          the play that reads, "What We Talk When We Talk About Love".
          Above the title, in smaller print, "Riggan Thomson and Mike
          Shiner". Below on a banner, "Opening Night".
          We keep climbing until we arrive at Riggan's dressing room
          window. We push in to find...52        INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - EVENING                52... that the room is full of roses and cards. Riggan lies on
          the sofa, hugging a cushion. He is wearing the long wig and
          mustache for the motel scene.

          Sylvia appears in the doorway.SYLVIAWow, that is just NASCAR hot.

          He smiles at her.SYLVIA (CONT'D)I just wanted to come say hello. It's going

          seem abnormally calm.RIGGANI am calm. I'm great. I spent most of
          the day observing how beautifully this
          pile of dirty clothes was lit by the
          warm afternoon sun. (A tiny smile.) So
          beautiful.
Sylvia, teasing him, closes her eyes and imitates Riggan's
meditation posture.SYLVIA(Mocking him.)

          and tried to drown myself.

Silence. Sylvia stares at Riggan, surprised.RIGGAN (CONT'D)I was in up to my chest when I felt the
          first one. On my back, like somebody was
          holding a frying pan against me. And then

          of jellyfish. I fought my way out of the
          water, and I started rolling around the
          sand like a maniac... crying.

          birth. First of all because you and Sam
          both look like shit in that video. But
          mostly because I missed the moment. I

Sylvia lingers for a moment, and not knowing what to say, she
exits. Riggan opens a drawer and takes out a black case. He(CONTINUED)10/29/14   /   104.gently opens the lid. Inside a revolver. He takes some bullets
     out of a box and one by one loads them into the chamber as he

     He stares at the dressing room door, and with his telekinetic
     powers he opens it. He snaps the cylinder into the gun and
     exits out into...53   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                        53...the hallway. He paces deliberately, gun in hand.

     A technician goes by in the opposite direction.TECHNICIANBreak a leg, Mr. Thomson.

     Riggan ignores him and continues through to the...54   INT. BACKSTAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                      54...backstage area. Annie immediately hustles over to him holding
     up the brain mechanism. He walks right by her.RIGGAN(Brushing her off.)

     Annie doesn't seem to understand. She stays there, holding the
     device. Riggan takes his place outside the motel door. We pan
     toward the audience. The auditorium is full. The audience in
     complete silence.

     Riggan raises one hand to silence Mike. Mike looks at him,
     confused. His eyes narrow on the gun. There is no red plug.

     Dead silence. An eerie electricity in the theater.RIGGANWhat's wrong with me? Why do I end
               up having to beg people to love me?LESLEYEd. Eddie. Please... Give me the gun.

     She begins to cry.LESLEY (CONT'D)Just look at me. I was drowning. I

For the first time, Riggan turns to face the audience. He
smiles the most beautiful insane smile.RIGGANI don't exist. I'm not even here. I don't
          exist. None of this matters.

Then he raises a trembling arm, and with his eyes full of
tears, he aims the gun at Mike.RIGGAN (CONT'D)Pum.

But he doesn't shoot. Then he turns and aims at Tabitha
Dickinson who is sitting on the second row.RIGGAN (CONT'D)Pum.

Again, no shot. Slowly, Riggan raises the gun toward his own
head, suddenly a frightening explosion. Blood sprays. Riggan
falls. We stay with the shell-shocked audience. A moment of
tension, of uncertainty, until...MANBravo!

The audience, one by one, jump to their feet, applauding
wildly. The sole exception is Tabitha, who remains seated, a
dazed expression on her face. We stay with the audience a few
seconds longer.FADE TO BLACK.The sounds slowly vanish. After a moment of silence...BIRDMAN (V.O.)You won't be hearing from him

We pan away from the TV to see that the waiting room is
filled with newsmen waiting for something to happen. There is
almost no room to breath.

We pan to see Jake emerging from an elevator, carrying a
newspaper under his arm. He walks through the dense mass of
newsmen with a serious expression on his face. We follow him
into...INT. ROOM - HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS...a room. Jake peers in. Riggan lies on a bed, the bandages
on his nose cover most of his face. Sylvia is looking out the

Jake rushes to the door, shoving the newsman and a few other
paparazzi out the door. Security guards. Chaos. Finally
silence. Sylvia steps up and looks Riggan in the eye.SYLVIAIs that what it was? An accident?
Riggan just stares at her. His calm, sad eyes peeking through
the bandages. After a moment his gaze moves over her
shoulder. Sylvia turns and we discover Sam standing in the
doorway holding a bouquet of flowers. A bit of awkward
silence, and Sylvia decides to leave them alone.

She kisses Sam on the head and exits. Sam walks the flowers
to Riggan at the bed. She lays them on his chest.SAMAlchemillas.

A moment between them. Sam picks up the flowers and kisses
him tenderly on the head. Riggan is pleasantly surprised by
that kiss.SAM (CONT'D)Now, I'm going to find something to
          put these flowers in.

She heads out of the room. Riggan lies there for a moment,
tranquil. After a moment he reaches up and touches his
bandages. Finally, he climbs out of the bed. We follow him
into...INT. BATHROOM - ROOM - HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS...the bathroom. He stands before the mirror. He stares at
his reflection for a few seconds, and slowly begins to remove
the bandages. We can see that Riggan's nose has been
reconstructed. It is a crooked, incomplete nose, like the one
Javier Bardem has.RIGGANI do look hideous.

In the reflection, Riggan sees Birdman sitting on the toilet.
They look at each other, but say nothing. Riggan puts the
bandages back on and we follow him out to...10/29/14   /   112.INT. ROOM - HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS...the room. He looks around, but Sam is gone. He ambles over
to the window, his ass hanging out of the back of his
hospital robe. He opens the window and feels the sun and the
breeze on his swollen face. We just hear the sounds of the
people standing down in the parking lot. Media trucks. Fans.
We stay with Riggan, who seems to be thinking about
something. He sees a flock of birds dancing in the sky. Then
he grabs the side of the window with one hand and begins to
step up onto the sill.
The camera pans away from him to a table that has some photos
propped on it: One of he and Sam when she was a child. One
with Sylvia and Sam. A copy of Carver's "What we talk About
When We Talk About Love" laying on the surface.

The camera continues to pan until it comes to the door. Sam
enters with a small vase. She looks around...SAMDad?

She goes to the bathroom and peers in... nothing.SAM (CONT'D)Dad...?

She spots the opened window and registers the sounds from
outside. Tentatively she walks toward the window. She gets
there, summons her courage and looks down. Nothing. Slowly,
confused, she tilts her head up and looks up into the sky. A
smile, filled with pride, begin to wash over her face.SMASH TO BLACK         *FOXSEARCHLIGHT.COM/AWARDSReleased by Twentieth Century Fox � 2014 Twentieth Century Fox
