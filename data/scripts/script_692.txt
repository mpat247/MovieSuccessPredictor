          QUICK CUTS of a series of five-year olds standing beside

              Max shrugs.INT. COURTROOM .-- DAYFLETCHER REID, early 30's, stands before the JUDGE. His
              manner is utterly genuine and convincing.FLETCHERA dark street. . . a stormy
                        night... two desperate men
                        struggle... one man is taken
                        to the hospital, the other to
                        ja il. The prosecutor wants
                        you to believe this is an
                        open-and-shut case of a poor
                        man, brutally victimized.
              He nods at the victim - - a fragile OLD MAN in his 70's.FLETCHER (CONT'D)Well, for once I agree with
                        t he prosecutor. This is an
                        open-and shut case -- but the
                        true victim is my client.
              Fletcher's CLIENT is a 250 pound brute in a suit.FLETCHER (CONT'D)Put yourself in his shoes for
                        a moment--walking home from
                        church, alone, in a
                        frightening part of the
                        suburbs.
              As he describes his client's movements, Fletcher ACTS THEMOUT:FLETCHER (CONT'D)You're nervous, timid, looking
                    over your shoulder -- when
                    suddenly, you encounter him--
                          (pointing at the
                           old man)
                    pouncing from the shadows.
                    You quiver in fear. The
                    streetlight flashes on
                    something shiny in his hand--
                    a knife?

          Suddenly Fletcher becomes the attacker, brandishing a
          weapon. The jurors RECOIL.FLETCHER (CONT'D)And in that terrifying instant
                    you do what any respectable
                    citizen would -- you defend
                    y ou rse lf. Only after you
                    shatter his arm and collarbone
                    do you realize it's all a
                    mistake... the man was merely
                    walking away from an ATM
                    machine, the apparent flash of
                    metal caused by his bank card.
          He reveals the weapon in his hand is only a credit card.FLETCHER (CONT'D)(CONCERNED)As you stand over his
                    crumpled, though potentially
                    still-dangerous form, your
                    he art goes out to him. You
                    want to help. First, you
                    gather up the many bills he
                    dropped, to stop them from
                    bl owi ng away. Second, in an
                    effort to get the name and
                    number of someone to notify,
                    you take his wallet. Finally,
                    you leap into the man's Lexus
                    to head for assistance, when
                    suddenly a police car speeds
                    up. You breathe a sigh of
                    relief: "Someone to look -after
                    the injured man! Oh joy!"
                    But do the police applaud your
                    initiative? Do they hail your
                    heroism? No-- they arrest you
                    and throw you in the slammer!
          He walks along the jury box:FLETCHER (CONT'D)� And why? Why does the State
                   turn its massive power against
                   this individual?
                         (takes anIMPRESSIVEmoment, then

                   wants you to think - - i t ' s
                   always the big guy's fault.
                   Is that what we've come to as
                   a society -- persecuting
                   people because they're large?
          Fletcher points accusingly at the opposition.FLETCHER (CONT'D)Shame on you, Mister
                   Prosecutor! Shame on you!
                          (turning back toJURY)The state is trying to
                   barbeque my client on the spit
                   of Justice. Only you can douse
                   the flames. The decision is

                   sons alone after the tragic
                   death of their mother, has
                   absolutely no bearing on this
                   case.

                    Boston means this
                          (snaps hisFINGERS)to me. All I want is for this
                    lady and Max to be happy.
                    Preferably, with me. Whatever
                    they want, I'll go along with.
          They both look to Audrey.AUDREYAll I want is for Max to be
                    happy.
          Audrey looks over to Max seated at the bottom of the
          stairs. He's still upset.AUDREYYou better know your jury.
                    You're hot exactly Max's hero
                    today.FLETCHERJust let me present my case.
          Fletcher walks over,, tries to be playful, starts WALKING,TALKING LIKE THE TERMINATOR.FLETCHER/TERMINATORI have been sent from the
                    future to destroy you. . .

                         (no response, aBEAT)You mad at me?
          Max nods. Fletcher's at a loss for how to begin. Then:FLETCHERYou wanted me to stop lying.
                    But lying isn't the problem. ..
                    Why we lie ~ that's the
                    problem. Sometimes we lie to
                    make someone else feel better.
                    But sometimes we lie because
                    the truth gets in our way...
                          (touches him)
                    But being an adult means you
                    sacrifice some things for moreimportant things. Much more
                    important things. I was so
                    stupid, Max.
                          (pointing to his

                    All this time you've been here
                    and I could see you anytime I
                    felt like it. And I...
                    didn't. Please don't go to
                    Boston. Max, I love you more
                    than anything else in the
                    world and you know it's true.
                    I couldn't say it if it
                    weren't true. Not today.
          A moment as Max studies his father, then:MAX(to Audrey)
                    He's telling the truth, Mom.
                    He's not allowed to lie. I
                    made a wish and anything Dad
                    says has to be the truth.
                          (to Fletcher) ..
                    Right?
          But Fletcher's looking at his watch...FLETCHERMax. .. it's 9:22.AUDREYWhat?FLETCHERMax, you made the wish at
                    9:15. I've been able to lie
                    for the last seven minutes.
          Max steps away from Fletcher.MAXSo then, you were...FLETCHERNo! It wasn't a lie. I just
                    wanted to be honest with you
                    and tell you -- there was no
                    wish to guarantee it anymore.
                    You just have to believe me.
          Max looks at Audrey, who is letting Max decide for himself
          Max looks at Fletcher and tries to decide.MAX(to Audrey)
                     Mommy... do we have to go to
                     Boston?
          Audrey looks at Jerry, then back at Max.AUDR EYNo.      We don't have to.
          Fletcher hugs his son -- the kind of hug that says "I'll
          never let you go."MAX(to Fletcher)
                     Can we play catch tomorrow?
          Fletcher smiles. . .EXT. PARK - DAYA beautiful park with a basball diamond. Fletcher is
          seated on a bench, waiting. He's dressed in sweats, with a
          baseball glove. Soon, Jerry, Audrey, and Max pull up...M AXDad! !FLETCH ERMa x i mu m ! !

          Fletcher starts KISSING MAX on the head over and over. He
          sees Audrey.FLETCHERProcreate!          Procreate!AUDREY(PLAYFULLY)Fletcher... You're gonna lose

          He puts Max down. Max runs into position. Fletcher stops
          for a second and turns to Jerry, man to man.FLETCHERI take back every dirty,

          ball to Max.FLETCHER(to Max)
