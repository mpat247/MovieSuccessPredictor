                              Lawrence D. Cohen & Stephen KingFADE IN:From an absolutely glistening WHITE � an image which first appears to be a
   brilliantly shining glass globe, and then gradually becomes more of a piece of solid
   matter, less of a mystery. It's theEXT. WHITE BUNGALOW (OR HOUSE) � DAY1. FILLING THE FRAME like a picture postcard. Modest, old-fashioned,
   spotless � a vision of small town normalcy and virtue.

   This is the home of MARGARET WHITE and her daughter CARRIE. It seems
   to have been scrubbed from roof to porch; it is white. Even the lawn seems to
   have been washed and bleached. Antiseptic.

   We hear a woman's voice:

                                 MARGARET (o.s.)
                          Carrie! Carrie

   The voice is distant but insistent. It is heard, in perspective, through the following prologue,
   which initially involves:2. STELLA HORAN � DAYAn all-American sunbathing beauty of eighteen, getting the tan of her life with only a skimpy
   white bikini running interference between her skin and the sun.

   The CAMERA SLOWLY PANS OVER the expanse of her body � luxuriant, taking it in
   inch for inch as she dreamily rubs in suntan lotion and licks her lips. The MUSIC is coming
   from a transistor radio by her side; she's on a beach blanket in the Horan back yard.3. DOWNWARDS ANGLE � STELLAAs she senses someone standing over her, someone staring at her body through the half-
   grown hedge which separates the Horan back yard from the White house next door.VOICE (O.S.)What are those?24. STELLA'S POV � CARRIE WHITEA terribly appealing little girl, a child of indeterminable age. Pink cheeks, a halo of blonde-
  white hair which will darken in time. What sets her apart from other children, however, are a
  pair of bright button brown eyes; and it's these eyes that we notice as she peers at Stella
  through the hedge.STELLAHiya, Carrie. Gee you gave me a fright.
                                (turning down the radio)
                         How long have you been there?CARRIE(not smiling; pointing with her finger)
                         What are those?

  Stella looks where Carrie is pointing; the top of her bikini has slipped, just barely revealing
  her breasts � white against the golden tan. Stella adjusts her suit � not out of any particular
  modesty of her own but as a reflex at being stared at so strangely.STELLAThose are my breasts, honey.CARRIE(a beat; then solemnly)
                         I wish I had some.STELLAYou will. `Course you'll have to wait a
                         couple of years, but �CARRIE(a fact)
                         No I won't.STELLAWhy, sure you will.CARRIE(emphatic)
                         No, I won't.
                                (glancing behind her)
                         Momma says no... Momma says good girls don't.3STELLA(at something of a loss)
                   Well, I'm a good girl. And besides, doesn't your mother have breasts?5    CARRIEGlances anxiously at the mention of her mother at the White house next door.
    She swallows her words so that all Stella and we hear is:CARRIE...dirtypillows.STELLAWhat?CARRIEMomma calls them dirtypillows. Says she's got them
               `cuz she was bad when she made me.6   STELLAIncredulous. But she senses that Carrie is both perfectly serious and quite worried, and she
    too glances warily over at the White house just beyond the half-grown hedge.

    She kneels next to Carrie and tries to laugh it off.STELLANow, honey, that's just silly. Listen � you must be real
                           hot in that long dress. What do you say we go inside and
                           get us some lemonade, would you like that?7   CARRIEClearly torn � tempted but in the clutch of some weird terror � as if she expected the
    earth to open and swallow her up. She shakes her head.STELLAC'mon.
                                    (offering her hand)
                           It'll be our secret.

    Carrie � now really scared � shakes her head and disappears farther into the hedge.4CARRIEI can't!STELLASure you can. I make it nice and sweet, and �

  And just at that moment, a figure appears in the second-story window in the White house.
  Although Stella and we really can't distinctly see through the sun's glare, it's unmistakably
  MARGARET WHITE. The moment this big woman sees her daughter with Stella, she lets
  out a bloodcurdling scream:MARGARETCAARRIEETTAAA!!!8 CARRIE, STELLABoth frozen by this terrible sound9 STELLA'S POV � CLOSER ON CARRIEAs she sucks in her breath, quivering with fright, looking as if she might faints. She looks
  quickly to Stella, then back at the White house, then back to Stella. For the merest flash, she
  seems to smile � or is she about to cry?

  And then, she's gone � running around the hedge and then up the porch stairs and into the
  White house as fast her legs can carry her.10. STELLAStands there, riveted. Not knowing what's happened, what to do. It's utterly silent for a
  moment.

  And then, an incredible CACOPHONY of strange sounds starts coming from the White
  house � an unearthly babble as Margaret White screams, rants, and screeches; as Carrie sobs
  that she's sorry, that she forgot.STELLAMother!
                               (louder)
                         Mother!511. THE HORAN HOUSEAs MRS. HORAN � in an old housedress with the hem falling down in the back � rushes out
  to answer to her daughter's call.MRS. HORANWhat in the name of God? What's the matter?STELLA(frantic)
                          I don't know... Carrie was just talking to me,
                          and Mrs. White started screaming and...12. THE WHITE HOUSEThe sun glistening brilliantly on it as in the opening shot. Again, it should appear like a huge
  glass globe over which we counterpoint one mother/daughter dialogue with the less distinct
  babble of another:

                                  MARGARET (v.o.)
                          I told you to stay away from there, I told you....

                                 CARRIE (v.o.)
                          I'm sorry, Momma.

                                  MARGARET (v.o.)
                          ... of Babylon!

  Which continues over:13. TWO SHOT � STELLA AND MRS. HORANTheir eyes riveted on the house � trying, squinting to see through the sun's terrible glare.STELLADon't you yell at her like that! Stop that!MRS. HORANThat poor sweet child...6STELLAMother, we've got to do something!MRS. HORANWhat?STELLACall the police? Mother, call the police!MRS. HORAN(not about to interfere; hopeless)
                         The child...

  At this point, the hysteric babble reaches its crescendo; we should be able to pick out phrases
  in this cacophony as Margaret rants at Carrie to go into her closet and pray for forgiveness;
  as Carrie's frightened little voice proclaims that she forgot, that she's sorry. And then
  suddenly the screaming stops and it's quiet � dead quiet.14 THE WHITE HOUSEAs it becomes more distinct, visible. There's a low WHISTLING sound, and then what
  appears to be a stone the size of a small pebble lands on the roof.

  Another, slightly larger one appears a second or two later. And then another, and another,
  and...15 TIGHTER TWO SHOT � STELLA AND MRS. HORANsquinting, blinking at the pebbles which are coming down like marbles.16 THE WHITE HOUSEas it's pelted with what are now even larger stones � WHISTLING, SCREAMING in the air
  like miniature bombs.

  Stones from a perfectly blue summer day.

  Stones ranging in size from marbles to handballs.

  One of them hits a downspout, knocking it onto the lawn. CRASHING, CRACKING
  SOUNDS as these pieces of granite tear into the stucco roofing, leaving holes.

  The effect is that of a drum being bombarded.717. TWO SHOT � MRS. HORAN AND STELLAFrozen to the spot: Mrs. Horan with her hands over her ears, her screams blending with the
  SOUND of larger and larger stones as they pelt the house and we hear Margaret throughout
  screaming:MARGARET'S VOICEStop that! Stop that!

  Stella is clutching Mrs. Horan like a child terrified by the freakiest of summer storms � a
  healthy young woman as her figure in the bikini testifies, but a child nonetheless, this
  nightmarish moment.18 THE HOUSEAs still larger stones hail from the sky.

  And then just as suddenly and inexplicably as they started, they stop.19 TWO SHOT � THE WOMENMrs. Horan with her hands still over her ears, her daughter standing next to her, transfixed on
  the lawn. Once again, it's quiet.20 THE WHITE HOUSEAs one final stone � this one the size of a mere pebble � falls from the roof and plops onto
  the lawn.

  The image grows lighter and lighter. All the color seems to bleach out, turning the screen
  once again into an incredible, silently blazing white.MAIN TITLES.21 EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE � MORNINGNow some years later � and no longer glistening so whitely or mysteriously. We see the
  front of the house as the door flies open. Carrie, now sixteen or seventeen, appears in the
  doorway, carrying school books. As she comes out on the porch, the screen door bangs
  behind her.8She is wearing a shapeless, drab dress � much too long, not so much out of style as utterly
  without style. What remains in this adolescent girl that links her with the pretty child we
  glimpsed in the prologue are those remarkable eyes.

  As she comes down the porch stairs, we hear:MARGARET'S VOICECarrie!

  Carrie stops, turns to reply into the house.CARRIEYes, Momma.MARGARET'S VOICEYou come straight home from school.

  A moment of hesitation on Carrie's part, a very slight hint of rebellion, but:CARRIE(sweetly)
                         I always do, Momma.

  Then she turns, walks to the street, gathering pace, quickening.22. EXT WHITE HOUSE � ANOTHER ANGLEAs Carrie walks down the path from the porch and turns at the sidewalk, in the course of
  which she passes by where the Horans used to live. Only the Horans no longer live here. No
  one does. It's a vacant lot with a FOR SALE sign out front, with overgrown weeds. From
  the looks of them, the house vanished a long time ago.23 EXT. TOWN STREETS � DAYCarrie is walking to school, the sun shining brightly above her. The farther she gets from her
  house, the livelier she seems. We sense that underneath this drab dress is a girl pushing out,
  an altogether different creature than her appearance would suggest. And to help persuade us
  about this possibility, there is MUSIC.24 BOBBY ERBETERAbout five, BOBBY bikes on the other side of one of the streets, keeping pace with Carrie on
  a twenty-inch Schwinn with training wheels.9BOBBYHey, fart-face! Hey, old praying Carrie! Praying, Carrie, praying
                          Carrie, praying Carrie!

   Carrie favors him with a sweet tolerant smile and goes on toward the high school, in the
   background:

   Bobby, frustrated, stops astride is bike and screams after her.

   Bobby's face �DISSOLVE TO:25 THE FACE OF AN ADOLESCENTOr as he is known in school, THE BEAK. He is pathetically thin, myopic, weak-chinned,
   beak-nosed, almost a caricature of an adolescent reject. Over his face, we HEAR:FROMM'S VOICEWhat are you going to leave for us,
                          You people in your big cars
                          Spewing pollution into the air?

   We PAN the faces of adolescents, listening with various degrees of attention, indifference, or
   reluctance, to:FROMM'S VOICEYou people with heavy feet
                          Trampling down the wilderness?

   reading from an assignment paper.FROMM...If you will let us have room enough
                          And air enough

  We also see TOMMY ROSS � a mid-seventies version of the boy next door. Good-looking,
  clean-cut, intelligent, athletic.28 FROMMHe is nodding his head slowly, affecting a kind of puzzlement.FROMMI must say � I must confess � this poem displays an extraordinary
                         talent...
                                  (the knife)
                         ...a talent extraordinary for you, Tommy Ross.29 THE CLASSAll eyes are on Tommy, who doesn't seem very abashed. In fact, he turns, clasps his hands
  over his head, to the delight of his classmates. But you don't get the feeling he is a goof-off;
  he is a kid aware of his own popularity and comfortable with it.30 FROMMFROMMTommy, this is slightly different from running for a
                       touchdown... Any criticisms?31 THE CLASSThe usual hesitation. Then Carrie's hand shoots up.32 FROMMHe appears surprised to see Carrie, ordinarily shy, volunteering.FROMMCarrie White?33 THE CLASS � FEATURING CARRIE11Her volunteering has surprised her as well. But she's stuck with it. The eyes of the class are
   on her. And she has to say something. So she does.CARRIEIt's... beautiful.34 FROMMHe leaves his desk, moving into the class area, seeming to pounce on Carrie.FROMM`Beautiful.' `Bee-t-ti-ful!' `Oh beautiful for spacious
                skies, for amber waves of grain.' Is that the beautiful you mean?

   The class is snickering. Carrie throws a despairing glance toward Tommy. Tommy looks at
   her, and away, embarrassed. Carrie looks down at her desk, almost burying herself.FROMMThat isn't exactly a criticism, Miss White.
                        (looking around)
                Anyone else?
                        (no one else)
                Well, at least we've finally gotten Carrie White
                          to say something!

   Tommy looks toward Carrie, with something suggesting compassion.
   Then he looks toward Fromm, and he is muttering something. Or to be specific:TOMMY(muttering)
                  You suck.FROMMTommy? You said something?TOMMYYes, sir.
                           (moment; "popular" grin)
                  I said... `shucks.'

   But everyone in the class knows.CUT TO:35 OMITTED1236 EXT. VOLLEYBALL COURT � DAYTwo teams of girls, among them NORMA WATSON, HELEN SHYRES, CORA and
 RHONDA WILSON (sisters although not identical twins), CHRIS HARGENSEN and SUE
 SNELL. Supervising the game is MISS COLLINS wearing a warm-up suit and holding a
 whistle awaiting the next point. Among the girls is CARRIE anxiously watching for the ball
 to come her way. It has apparently been a close game, the competition building steadily.
 When the shot begins, Miss Collins has just blown her whistle to announce:COLLINSOkay, now. This is game point.

 This is the final point of the game and Rhonda Wilson is serving (she is on the opposite team
 as Carrie).RHONDA(giving the score)
                Twenty � Twenty.

 The ball is successfully served and remains in play for some time as the girls skillfully volley
 it back and forth over the net. And then, just when the tension is its greatest, the ball comes
 over the net toward Carrie. It's evident that the outcome of the game depends upon her
 success. The little boy who decided to put his finger in the dyke had it easier.

 The other girls are (AD LIB) shouting cautions and admonitions to Carrie. Carrie almost
 trembles with tension, about to bat the ball over the net, afraid to hit it.

 Carrie whacks the ball. She shacks it hard. And on a line � straight into the net.

 Another chorus of groans, with remarks like "Wouldn't you know!" and "Dumbo!"
 reinforcing them. Chris storms back toward Carrie.CHRIS(low, harsh)
                You eat shit!

 Miss Collins blows her WHISTLE.CUT TO:1337 INT SHOWER ROOM � DAYSteam partially obscures the girls as they whoop and holler and cavort under individual
  showers. They banter little barbed pleasantries, bits of sexual information, family plaints,
  talk of college � all of which we hear from separate stalls.

  One by one the showers are turned off, the girls stepping out, removing pastel bathing caps,
  toweling, spraying deodorant, bras hooked, underpants stepped into. Steam hangs in the air.
  So do words, running into one another, tumbling, drifting.

  `...Tommy says he hated it on me... My sister's husband picks his nose... So does your
  sister... too cheap to spend a penny... we'll go after school... I'm going with Billy, we'll
  meet you... Friday night...'

  We PICK UP Miss Collins as she steps among the girls, spies Carrie still standing under the
  shower. She claps her hands together once, smartly.COLLINSWhat are you waiting for, Carrie?
                          (as Carrie looks at her)
                 Bell in five minutes.CARRIEOh uh?

  As Collins departs, and the other girls start to move toward their lockers, Carrie is left alone
  in her shower stall. She is soaping herself. In a virtual reverie, she begins at her shoulders,
  moving her hands over her breasts in small, regular, virtually erotic circles. Her hand goes
  out of frame, below her stomach. Slowly, it emerges back into frame � full of blood. And
  just as she and we see this, so do the girls.CHRISPeer-iod! Peer-iod!

  Carrie stares at her dumbly.

  The other girls are quick to take up the chant. Chris leads them.GIRLSPeer-iod! Peer-iod! Peer-iod! Peer-iod!

  One voice chimes in:NORMA14Plug it up!

Others take up this new chant. For a while, like counterpoint, he chants overlap; then the
new chant emerges solely:GIRLSPlug it up! Plug it up! Plug it up! Plug it up!

Dime-sized drops are striking the tile floor at Carrie's feet.SUEFor God's sakes, Carrie, you got your period.
                       (as Carrie turns toward her)
                Clean yourself up!

Carrie seems bewildered.SUE(furiously)
                You're bleeding! You dumb pudding, you're bleeding!

Carrie looks down and wails, the sound is very loud.

A tampon strikes Carrie's chest, plops to her feet. Carrie just stares at it.NORMAShe thinks they're for lipstick.

Behind her, another girl pretends to throw up.

Shrieks of laughter. Another tampon strikes Carrie. Another. The girls are bombarding her
with tampons and sanitary napkins, some from purses, some from the broken dispenser on
the wall. As they bombard Carrie:GIRLSPlug it up, plug it up, plug it up, plug it up....

We isolate Sue Snell at the moment she joins in the chant, and watch her beginning to be
caught up in what can only be described as a fury.

Carrie howls and begins to back away, howling louder and louder.

The door is flung open by Collins.COLLINS15What is this?

And she takes it in. She jerks the whistle to her mouth, blows and blows! The sound is
louder than a shriek (which it resembles) or a howl (which it doesn't).

And there is sudden silence.COLLINS(to girls)
                Get out! Get out!

The girls retreat, Sue last.SUEIt must be her first...COLLINSOut!

As the girls slip out, Collins turns to Carrie, who has backed up and is whimpering. Collins
slaps her face, not too hard at first, then with a flash of anger.CARRIEM... M... Miss Collins...COLLINSStand up. Take care of yourself.CARRIEI'm bleeding.

One blind searching hand comes up, clutches Collins' white shorts, leaving a bloody
handprint.COLLINSDamn you!

She hurls Carrie part way across the room toward the broken sanitary napkin dispenser.COLLINSGet over there! And take one!CARRIE16I don't know...COLLINSNever mind the coin slot... It's broken.CARRIEIt hurts... my stomach...COLLINS(grabbing her)
                   Do it! Now.CARRIEI can't. I don't know how!

   There's a bright flash as a light BULB POIPS, fizzling out. Collins is surprised.COLLINSWhat...?

   And she looks at Carrie. Her anger seems to seep away. Her voice softens.COLLINSCarrie, don't you know...?
                           (shakes her head, realizing and wondering)
                   You don't.

   Two things happen simultaneously; Morton recoils slightly and the ashtray quakes a little
   and then tumbles from the desk.

   Then Carrie goes out.

   Morton comes around the desk, stoops to pick up the ashtray, stares at it curiously for a

   What can one say? Eleanor stands there, completely exasperated but retaining her politeness
 like a steel, middle-class glove. She accompanies Margaret to the door and the latter leaves.
 Eleanor is about to close the door, stops, seeing:71 EXT SNELL HOUSE � FROM DOOR � DAYSue is coming toward the door. She passes Margaret with a quick (inaudible) greeting and

   leaves). A long beat, then:DISSOLVE TO:72 CARRIEWho is sitting in an old Boston rocker by the window in her room which overlooks the street.
   She is wearing just a slip or perhaps an old terrycloth robe � her plain dress and school books
   on the narrow bed.

    She is leafing through a teenage magazine on the order of "Seventeen" � absorbed in the
   mundane fantasies of models in their pantyhose and underwear; long gowns and mystery men.
   An escape of sorts.

   And we reveal Carrie's bedroom in the low attic of the White house: tiny, plain, severe. It's
   decorated with just the fewest embellishments (i.e. high school pennant) that Margaret would
   allow in exchange for her own prices � a crucifix above Carrie's bed, a small bureau with an
   equally small mirror, a Bible and plastic glow-in-the-dark Madonna and child, and various
   religious prints and plaster quotations on the wall.73 ANGLE � FEATURING CARRIECaught up in the magazine, in the most normal of female fantasies courtesy of the slick
   Madison Avenue mind. And then, with that extra sense of perception apparatus that fears it's
   about to be caught doing something it shouldn't, Carrie glances out the window and down to
   see:74 EXT THE STREET � MARGARETAs this formidable vision of black strides down the walk. Another woman like this would be
   coming home from a funeral; Margaret actually seems to like black.75 CLOSEUP � CARRIEHer heart pounding as we glimpse that look of terror we witnessed earlier � a scared little girl
   now encased in the body of an adolescent.

   As she hears Margaret close the front door and call out her name as she hangs up her coat,
   Carrie hastily stashes the magazine under the mattress. Then she begins to dress as we hear
   the SOUNDS of Margaret in the kitchen, starting her daily afternoon ritual of making tea.28And then the telephone RINGS � only to stop as Margaret picks up the receiver. It's just as
  Carrie dreaded � it's the school � and she stands by the door, trying desperately to overhear
  Margaret's muffled voice. And then Margaret hangs up, and in a deadly tone of voice � not
  yelling but enunciation with a terrible clarity � she calls up the stairs:MARGARET'S VOICEI know you're listening. Come downstairs.

  And defeated, Carrie braces herself and goes down the:76 HALLWAY, STAIRS, LIVING ROOM, FOLLOWING CARRIEAs she hurries down toward her mother and into:77 INT WHITE KITCHEN � DAYWhere Margaret is standing by the stove, her back to her in stony silence.CARRIEHello, Momma.

  No response. The teakettle is just beginning to boil over the gas burner, and in this altogether
  strange little kitchen � a veritable arsenal of lace-tatted religious art � Margaret is a rock.29Carrie sits down at the kitchen table, bursting with shame and the need to talk. Yet she
  recognizes her mother's wall of silence, knowing she won't speak until she's ready. They've
  been through this dance a thousand times. Finally, Carrie breaks.CARRIEWho was it that called?

  from the stove.MARGARET(softly)
                 You're a woman now.CARRIEOh Momma, why didn't you tell me something? I was so scared...

  Margaret walks over to the table and sits next to Carrie. She puts on rimless glasses, then
  opens the Bible and starts to read with one of those strange Kathryn Kuhlman looks on her
  face:MARGARET`And God made Eve from the rib of Adam. And Eve was

sting of it bringing tears to her eyes.CARRIEMomma, please listen. It wasn't my fault.

               been tempted by the Antichrist. She may have committed the Sin of
               Lustful Thoughts.

The teakettle is WHISTLING louder � a high-pitched scream.CARRIENo, Momma.MARGARETDon't you lie to me, Carietta, don't you know by now I can see inside
               you? I can see your sin just as surely as God can.CARRIEMomma, let me go.

Margaret flings open the door of the kitchen closet.MARGARETWe will pray. We will pray, woman, we will pray to Jesus for
               our woman-weak, wicked, sinning souls...

She switches on the light, and there is Jesus on the wall, rictus, crown of thorns, bathed in an
ominous blue light. A vision of a wrathful God. Throughout the following, Carrie struggles
desperately, but she's no match for her mother.32MARGARETAnd the Lord visited Eve with a Curse, and the Curse was the Curse
                 of Blood. And there was a Second Curse, and this was the Curse of

   To avoid the noise of the cheerleaders practicing down in front of them, and the other girls

   toke from a joint and hands it to her; she ignores that too, and proceeds to busy herself
   applying makeup in the visor window. So Billy looks out his window and strikes up some

    Carrie is inside, watching him come up the stairs. She remains on the hall side of the screen
   door.TOMMYSo this is where you live.CARRIEWhat... what're you doing here?66TOMMY(laughs)
               Aren't you going to ask me in?

She shakes her head; he laughs again, a little nervously. Throughout this scene in which he
remains on the porch side of the screen door, he catches glimpses of the weird house within.TOMMY(continuing)
               Why not?CARRIEMomma's resting. What do you want?TOMMYRight to the point, huh? Okay, about the prom.CARRIEI already told you.TOMMY(a little charm)

In the background � in the kitchen, perhaps � Margaret calls out Carrie's name.67Carrie glances nervously behind her; then back at Tommy.CARRIEYou better go.MARGARET'S VOICECarrie! Who are you talking to?TOMMYDon't you think you better answer?CARRIENo one, Momma.TOMMYYou're going with me.CARRIEI can't.TOMMYYou're going.CARRIEThey'll laugh.TOMMYNo one will laugh. We'll see to it.CARRIEPlease. Please go.TOMMYNot `til you say yes.

Carrie swipes at her eyes with the back of her hand; helpless, honest, confused. She'd really
like to go at this point, but that extra sense in her is resisting.CARRIEWhy? Why is it so important to you?TOMMYI don't know. Maybe it's because you liked my poem.68MARGARET (o.s.)
                  Carietta!!!

   And in just these split seconds, she decides; had he not "liked" her poem, had Margaret not
   called, perhaps she could have held back.CARRIEYes.

   Tommy smiles at her and, turning to leave, touches her hand against the screen door. A
   goodbye, nothing more. He goes down the walk toward his car.149 CARRIEWatching him. She takes the hand he "touched" and brushes the hair back from her face. A
   little beautiful? You bet.MARGARET'S VOICECarrie? Did you hear me?CARRIEComing, Momma. Coming.

Margaret throws her cup of tea in Carrie's face. It's cold, wet, sticky. But Carrie holds
herself in, she's going to be in charge this time. She takes a deep swallow and continues:CARRIE(continuing)

A gust of wind causes the window to blow open. Margaret gets up and starts toward the
window. Carrie is silent, watching herself being shut out.MARGARET(continuing)

   completely wrecked KENNY GARSON, a very nervous FREDDY DE LOIS, and an
   occasionally giggling, goggled HENRY TRENNANT � trailing behind. De Lois is swinging

   oblivion before our eyes.

   De Lois angrily snatches the roach out of Garson's fingers.DE LOIS(continuing)

   Trennant lurches into another cackle. And in spite of themselves, Billy and Chris start
   laughing, too. Even De Lois starts laughing.

   The group passes a "No Trespassing" sign, prompting:DE LOIS(continuing)

    it � joyous, triumphant.DISSOLVE TO:160A. INT. WHITE LIVING ROOM � AFTERNOONMargaret sits beneath the plaster crucifix.

    The sampler, however, sits in her lap � unfinished, unminded. She's virtually catatonic.

    "Amazing Grace" � a sweet, contemporary rendition � is on the Webcor. A pleasure after
    Kathryn Kuhlman.

    removes the material from the sewing machine, which we now see is a lush crushed velvet.MARGARETRed. I might have known it would be red.

    The cuckoo clock is TICKING, TICKING.

    Carrie stares at Margaret, then turns the sewing machine off. She looks back at Margaret,
    then turns her attention to the machine, her eyes sparkling.

    Courtesy of Carrie, the treadle on the machine depresses itself.

    The needle starts to bob up and down, up and down, up and down... WHIRRING, jerking.

    The side wheel spins. And then stops.CARRIE(softly)

There's nothing more to say. Carrie walks up to the stairs, and we:DISSOLVE TO:80161 INT. GYMNASIUM � NIGHTVery dark, shadowy, deserted. The night before the prom. Silence, then a SCRAPING sound
   of a:162 WINDOWBeing jimmied open. Behind the thick glass, we see a face � just whose isn't clear yet. The
   slip-lock comes free, the sill is being pushed up, and Billy's head appears. Chris is right
   behind him.163 LONG SHOT � THE GYMAs a flashlight is shined upwards � at the criss-crossing girders sheathed in crepe paper; at
   banks of lights which will later be used to shine down and highlight two areas in particular �
   the huge wall mural and the chalked-in spot where the King and Queen of the Prom will be
   crowned.164 TWO SHOT � BILLY AND CHRISDOLLYING right behind them as they proceed toward the stage area � past the numerous
   tables set up for the prom-goers, past the twin bandstands. Billy is carrying the ice chest,

   rubber gloves, snaps them on. Then he takes out two small pulleys and a coil of twine.166 CHRIS' POV � BILLYLooking somewhat like a bizarre mountaineer, climbing a ladder which takes him up to a

  night approaches. The emphasis is on these two paralleling elements, although this montage �
  scored throughout with happier and happier MUSIC � will also feature some of our lesser
  characters.

  Among other things, we will see:

         party favors put on tables, etc.;

             B) CARRIE � in a town store as she shops for makeup;

         around, looking for something to do.83It is now the night of the Prom � just minutes before it officially begins, we end this montage
  and:DISSOLVE TO:171 INT. CARRIE'S ROOM � NIGHTCarrie sits in front of that same mirror, but this time, there's a different attitude. And a
  different girl, which pleases her. She looks different, very different, from before. She's
  dressed in her lush red crushed velvet prom dress, but the SHOT is ANGLED in such a way
  that we don't see it. In any case, it is not prim. She is wearing some makeup. She looks...
  well, there has been a transformation.

  In the background, the door is opened by Margaret.CARRIECome in, Momma.

  Margaret advances into the room.

  Carrie opens a florist box and takes out a lovely corsage of tiny tea roses.CARRIEDo you want to pin it on, Momma?MARGARETI can see your dirtypillows. Everyone will.CARRIEBreasts, Momma, breasts. Every woman has them.

  Carrie's voice is calm; nothing, not even Margaret, will spoil tonight, and ever so slightly, this
  scene � and all that follow for a considerable period of time � has an edge of unreality to it.
  It's all been diffused a bit � a fairy tale through Carrie's eyes. What would look bad or tacky
  looks acceptable; what looked good before now looks spectacular.MARGARETTake off that dress.CARRIENo.84MARGARETWe'll burn it together, we'll pray for forgiveness.CARRIENo, Momma.

The Black Forest CUCKOO CLOCK sings out downstairs. It's eight o'clock.MARGARETHe's not coming.CARRIEStop it, Momma. I'm nervous enough.

Margaret reaches up and pinches her cheek hard, leaving a red mark. She looks toward
Carrie.

Carrie is pinning the tea roses on herself.

Margaret hooks her right hand into a claw, rips at her cheek, leaving a thin line of blood.CARRIEStop hurting yourself, Momma. That's not going to stop me either.

Margaret strikes herself in the mouth with her fist.CARRIEGo away, Momma.MARGARETYou know I'm right. He'll laugh at you. They'll all laugh at you.CARRIENo. It'll be okay.

Bur she's rattled, and nervously starts moving around a series of objects in the room.
Cosmetics on the bureau, the florist box, the glow-in-the-dark statue. But it's sheer will at
this point. It's after eight, and there's no sign of Tommy.MARGARETIt's not too late. You can stay here with me.CARRIENo.85MARGARETI'll answer the door and say you're sick, I'll say �CARRIEMomma, sit on the bed.

  Flex.

  Margaret is thrust back on the bed.MARGARET`Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.'

  The words stop. But Margaret's eyes are fixed on Carrie, as Carrie leans toward her. Carrie's
  voice is soft and compassionate.CARRIEYou'll say nothing, Momma. You are going to have to learn that
                 I'm not like you, not anymore.

   Tommy laughs and nods. A moment of silence. Carrie is miserable � she's happy to be with
   Tommy, she's trying to have a good time, but it's hard. It's like getting up to dance the first
   time. Perhaps it would be better to sit this one out.CARRIETommy...

   And that's just enough � he's taken her mind off her own fear just enough to make her laugh.CUT TO:185 INT. GYMwhere the prom is already under way, the band PLAYING an energetic version of "Harlem
   Nocturne." From Carrie's POV it's all magic � explosions of pastel color, everyone looking
   like they stepped out of an advertisement for happiness.

   Carrie just stands at the double-doors which are the main entrance to the gym, taking it all in
   as Tommy hands their tickets to ushers at the door. As Carrie stares at the giant mural on the
   stage wall � full of celestial moon, stars and rockets � a VOICE bellows out behind her.VOICEHey, Ross. Gawd, you look queer.89186 GEORGE DAWSONThe source of the salutation and Tommy's best friend. He bounds INTO FRAME, wearing a
  T-shirt with a painted black tie under his dinner jacket. His girlfriend, Frieda Jason, tags
  behind.TOMMYWhen did you come out of the treetops, Bomba?GEORGERoss, if I'd known you were going to look this good, I'd have
                  asked you instead of Frieda.

  The two boys immediately go into a mock fight. Frieda comes up to Carrie.FRIEDADon't let it bother you. If they destroy each other, I'll dance with you.

  Carrie smiles back at her nervously; there's an awkward silence.FRIEDAHey, where'd you buy your dress? I love it.CARRIE(shyly)
                  I made it.FRIEDA(unaffected surprise)
                  Made it? No shit.

  Carrie hesitates; realizes Frieda is quite sincere.CARRIENo shit.

  Frieda laughs; so does Carrie, and the tension eases up. Behind them, Tommy keeps one eye
  on Carrie. He shrugs � it's working, goddammit � and he stuffs his hands into his dinner
  jacket.187 ANOTHER ANGLE � THE GYMCarrie and Frieda, Tommy and George right behind them, head for their tables.90FRIEDAThe mural's nice.CARRIEYes.

              A) JOSIE AND THE MOONGLOWS � THE BAND � make like Lawrence Welk
          and launch into an oldie-but-goodie. On drums � The Beak himself.
              B) THE TWINS � CORA AND RHONDA � dressed identically, dancing with
              C) ERNEST PETERSON, the black class president, is wonderfully officious as he
          gets the evening's first entertainment organized. It (or she) is �
              D) SANDRA STENCHFIELD and her fabulous twirling baton act, a phenomenon
          to the lilting STRAINS of "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head."
              E) NORMA is off in a corner, bending another girl's ear; STAN is standing idly
          by, pretending to be invisible.
              F) MORTON, FROMM and the other chaperones including MISS FISH look for
          something to do, for someone who's stepping out of line. And find it. In the person of
          FREDDY DE LOIS, who's guzzling the punch.

          Tommy lights a candle.189 ANGLE � TOMMY AND CARRIE'S TABLEAs Josie and the Moonglows launch into a new NUMBER. George suddenly comes to life.GEORGEViiibes!

   He grabs Frieda, and they make their way out onto the dance floor, Frieda shrugging
   helplessly at Carrie.CARRIEThey're nice. George is funny.92TOMMYHe's a good guy.

Tommy nods � it's okay with him.VOICECarrie?

Carrie turns around and finds herself facing Collins � dressed up, looking more like one of the
students than a teacher.CARRIEYou look very pretty, Miss Collins.COLLINSThank you
                     (beat)
               You too. Beautiful.CARRIEIt's awfully nice of you to say so. I know I'm not... not really...
               but thank you anyway.

Tommy � feeling like a fifth wheel � clears his throat and stands up.TOMMY`scuse me.
                      (to Carrie)
               Be right back, okay?

He goes off into the crowd.COLLINS(gesturing to his seat)
               May I?

Carrie nods, and she sits down, pulling the chair next to her. They're virtually alone at this
moment; everyone else is dancing or occupied.93COLLINSCarrie, anything that happened before... well, it's all forgotten.
               I want you to know that.CARRIEI can't forget it.
                        (beat)
               But it's over with. It's over.

Collins smiles; she looks at the dance floor and Carrie's eyes follow hers. At this particular
moment, the band is PLAYING a quiet number � slow, romantic.COLLINSI remember my own prom. I was two inches taller than the boy I
               went with when I was in my heels. He gave me a corsage that clashed
               with my gown. But it was magic. I don't know why. But I've never
               had a date like it, ever since. Is it like that for you?CARRIEIt's very... nice.COLLINS(smiling)
               Just nice?CARRIENo. There's more. I don't know...
                         (hesitating; then)
               ...it's like being on Mars.COLLINSYou'll never forget it.CARRIEI think you're right.

And then, on sheer impulse, Carrie reaches out and hugs her, hugs her tightly.CARRIEThank you.COLLINSHave a lovely time, Carrie.94TOMMY (o.s.)
               Hey, what's going on here?

There is Tommy, looking "stern."TOMMY(to Collins)
               What are you doing with my date?COLLINSGirl secrets.

A smile at Carrie, and she goes off.TOMMYDon't let me catch you hugging any guys.CARRIEYou won't.TOMMYBetter not. Hey, listen, do you really have to be back so early?CARRIEI promised.TOMMYOkay. I understand.CARRIEI'm sorry.TOMMYNo, it's okay. Listen, the other kids are going over to Lewiston
               after the Prom �CARRIE(breaking in)
               That's okay.TOMMYWhat is?CARRIEYou want to go with your friends. I don't want to spoil anything...95TOMMYHey, let me finish. What I was going to say, I mean if it'd be alright
                 with you, what do you say we go to the Cavalier?CARRIE(surprised; she'd love to)
                 I've never been there.TOMMYHey, great. We'll have the place all to ourselves. Great!
                         (he means it)
                 Then it's settled.

  He takes her arm, turns her toward the dance floor.CARRIE(holding back)
                 Tommy...TOMMYC'mon...CARRIEI don't... I can't... I...TOMMYYou can.

  He has his arms around her and half-spins, half tugs her out onto the floor. He is a young man
  of considerable confidence � the best part of his popularity � and it's a contagious trait.
  Gradually, Carrie gets caught up in the slow dancing, begins to follow him less and less
  awkwardly, begins to get less and less self-conscious, and, in short, starts to glide into her
  freedom.190 A CORNER OF THE GYMTommy and Carrie dance into this corner; Carrie is a bit breathless and very happy. For some
  moments, Tommy keeps his arms around Carrie, looking at her. And then he leans forward,
  about to kiss her, impulsively. And impulsively and instinctively, she draws back. And is
  immediately embarrassed.TOMMYHey...96CARRIEI'm sorry.TOMMYI...CARRIEIt's just...TOMMYNo harm, no foul.

They stand there for a couple of seconds.

And suddenly and swiftly, Carrie kisses Tommy. It's a quick, awkward, frightened kiss. A
bird peck.

And again they stand there, until:CARRIEI don't know... anything. I can't dance...TOMMYYou danced.CARRIEI don't even know how to...TOMMYIt's easy.

And he kisses her. She breaks, looking up at him.CARRIETommy... why?TOMMYWhy what?CARRIEWhy am I here?TOMMYIt's the prom.97CARRIEWith you.TOMMYBecause I asked you. And...CARRIEWhy? Why did you?TOMMYBecause I wanted to.CARRIEWhy?TOMMYBecause...

He pauses; he's on the edge. And steps back.TOMMY...you liked my poem. Only I didn't write it. Someone else did.CARRIEOh.

She's puzzled. And she's about to ask something else.TOMMY(quickly)
               Look, Carrie, we're here, we're together... and I like it, you know...
               I mean, I...CARRIEBut...

A commotion from the floor.

Tommy turns.TOMMYHey, look!

Carrie looks off, following his glance, at:98191 STAGE AREA � POVAs the head Custodian supervises the sliding of two thrones from the wings onto pre-set

                  Want to decline?CARRIEDo you want to?TOMMYHell, no. If you win, all you do is sit up there for the school song
                  and one dance. And they put your picture in the yearbook so everyone
                  can see we looked like idiots. Besides, it's the last year.

   Carrie looks up at the stage � at the massive thrones all in white.CARRIEThey're beautiful.TOMMYYou're beautiful.

   Carrie meets his eyes and blushes; it's all overwhelming her, and she has to look away � at the
   tiny party favor boat on the table in front of her, at the tiny pencil next to it.CARRIEWho do we vote for? They're more your crowd than mine.100TOMMYWhatever you like.CARRIEIn fact, I don't really have a crowd.TOMMYLet's vote for ourselves. To the devil with false modesty.

  She laughs aloud � the sound of her own laughter is so foreign to her that she claps a hand
  over her mouth, at her own daring. She takes the pencil and quickly circles their names � so
  quickly that the pencil breaks, bringing a small drop of blood to her finger. She gasps.TOMMYHurt yourself?CARRIENo.
                         (trying to smile)
                 But I broke it and it was a souvenir.TOMMYThere's still your boat.

   The BAND plays another FANFARE OF DRUMS. Ernest sees this as his big moment; he

   The band launches into a rock version of "Pomp and Circumstance."

   Ushers appear at Tommy and Carrie's table. George is pounding Tommy's back. An
   aluminum foil scepter is thrust into Tommy's hand; a robe with a fur collar is thrust over
   Carrie's shoulders.215 SUE � STAGE WINGSPeering out farther to get a good look. Unseen at first by her, there's a cord on the edge of theFRAME.216 MORTONBlocked by the clamor of the students, he's unable to make a straight bee-line for Sue in the

    emergency.273 CARRIESeeing the hose, getting the idea... NOTE: SPLIT SCREENS begin here.274 CLOSERas her eyes narrow and focus on the hose, zeroing on it.275 THE HOSEAs it starts to unwind, to unspiral into the air, starting to spray a burst of water.276 THE HOSE � ANOTHER ANGLEAs it becomes snake-like, water springing from the nozzle.277 THE STUDENTSCries of surprise as it begins to spray water on them, ruining their clothes.278 THE HOSEAs the velocity of the water increases, stronger and stronger.279 CARRIEEyes gleaming, a glimmer of triumph as she concentrates and surveys �280 THE STUDENTSLike rats in a maze � a slapstick chaos as they try to get away from the animated hose. The
    water forces the students back from the doors, backwards toward the stage.280A CHRIS AND BILLY � UNDER THE STAGEAs they see students propelled toward them by the hose.114281 CARRIEA smile of satisfaction. For the first time, she's showing them � they're the ones being made
   to look foolish. She's standing on one side of the stage.283 ERNESTLevel-headed to the end, making his way through the pandemonium toward the stage area and
   the bandstand as fast as he can...284 CARRIEStill controlling the hose, she spots Ernest, seeing him move toward the stage area.285 TRACKING � ERNESTknowing somehow � with some sixth sense � that Carrie's watching him. He feverishly
   hurries toward the area where the band equipment is plugged in... where the high voltage
   cables are hooked up to the electrical current.

   Behind him, Fromm has reached the microphone and is trying to be heard, telling everyone to
   remain calm.286 CARRIERealizing just what Ernest plans to do:CARRIE(gently; determined)

   reached him, and just as he touches the mic, he's electrocuted � his arm bursting into flame,
   unable to let go as his body goes into an electric dance, his mouth gaping open like a fish on
   land.115289 CARRIEWatching this; another flex, and:290 FROMMIs propelled backwards from the microphone; he falls backward into the cyc, his flaming arm
   igniting it. A celestial fantasy immediately bursts into flames. It prevents any of the students
   from using the back exit.291 THE STUDENTSWatching, riveted with horror, some of them screaming, others frozen to the spot as the cyc
   CRACKLES. Utter pandemonium.292 CARRIEHer face flushed, a vein in her forehead throbs, her heart pounding.

   stage collapse forward. The light bar begins to shake. Plaster drops, and the light bar DROPS

   Another flex.301 THE LIGHT BARstarts to swing recklessly around the gym. Back and forth, back and forth � it hits the ceiling,
   igniting it and the decorations. Flaming stars and planets begin dropping from the ceiling.302 BENEATH THE STAGE � CHRIS AND BILLYseeing their chance to escape while Carrie is busy with the light bar.

   The back door (which Sue couldn't enter from the outside, and which the cyc flames
   prevented any of the students on the gym floor to get to) is now free, and Billy and Chris see
   their chance to escape. They burst out from under the stage as:303 CARRIESpots them. In the instant it takes her to wonder what they're doing there, it's too late.
   They're out the door, and there's absolutely nothing she can do.304 THE GYM � FEATURING THE LIGHT BARAs it swings, catching Norma Watson in its path, casually whipping this screaming girl in her
   green chiffon dress back into a wall.

   Helen Shyres is backed into a corner, giggling with horror, in shock, utterly hysterical.

   Students have climbed onto the back of the bleachers, trying in vain to pry off the screens on
   the windows so they can escape.

   Morton has grabbed a chair and is trying to smash it through another of the windows. All this
   to no avail. End SPLIT SCREEN.117305 CARRIEAs she makes her way down the stage stairs and out onto the floor. She spots the cord going
   under the stage first, and realizes just how the trick was engineered... that Billy and Chris did

GYM � HALLWAYAs Carrie exits, the doors swinging shut. Behind her, through the windows, we see a wall of
   fire collapse behind her.

   She passes Sue in the hall who's sobbing hysterically. And as Carrie exits, Sue runs into this
   inferno of fire to find Tommy. And then the town WHISTLE BLOWS... and BLOWS. It
   overlaps onto:DISSOLVE TO:309 EXT. TOWN STREETS � NIGHTCarrie's on her way home. At this point, she looks less like a girl that the survivor of a grisly
   car accident; wet, caked with blood, eyes glistening madly, almost shapeless. She goes down
   a hill, and then, from:310 ANOTHER ANGLE � THE HILL � NIGHTas a fire truck rushes toward the school, past Carrie. And then shortly afterward, out of
   nowhere, Billy's Chevy � it's headlights gleaming, lurches forward; it's headed right for her.311 CARRIETurns around and sees it coming toward her.312 INT. THE CHEVYChris screaming "Get her! Get her!" at the top of her lungs, Billy grinning madly behind the

   They're heading right for the embankment. Billy's eyes are bugging out, Chris is screaming
   as:319 THE CHEVYPlows smack into the embankment and rolls over several times. It then bursts into a sheet of
   flames.119320 CARRIEWatching this explosion turn into a conflagration. We see the fire reflected in her puffy,
   exhausted face � brighter and brighter as we HEAR the sound of the WHISTLE merging with
   SOUND OF SIRENS, and:DISSOLVE TO:321 EXT WHITE HOUSE � NIGHTThe house is totally dark. Not even a porch light. In the distance, perhaps, the glow from the
   burning gymnasium.

   A figure is moving toward the house.

   It is Carrie.322 AT DOORCarrie tries the front door. It is unlocked. She opens it partially.CARRIE(small voice)

   Silence.

   Carrie closes the front door.323 INT. WHITE HOUSE � NIGHTWith the closing of the door, Carrie turns on a light. She looks around. The house is
   ominously empty, ominously still.120CARRIEMOMMA!Silence floods back in.

   Carrie moves to the foot of the stairs, turning on lights as she goes. She mounts the stairs,
   goes along the narrow hallway to her room.324 INT. CARRIE'S ROOM � NIGHTCarrie turns on the lights, closes the door.

   She stares at the Madonna-child figurine on the bureau.

   Then, slowly, she removes her blood-stained clothing, letting it lie in a heap.

   Clutching a robe, she goes into the bathroom.325 INT. BATHROOM � NIGHTCarrie turns on the shower, waits for it to get hot. It is almost steaming as she steps in.

   Very carefully, Carrie scrubs herself clean.

   Then she steps out of the shower, dries herself off briefly, puts on her robe, and turns off the
   bathroom light. What's important here is this gives us time to breathe, to focus on Carrie.326 INT. CARRIE'S ROOM � NIGHTCarrie returns to her room. She is clean now; her wet hair hangs. A feeling of despair about
   her or perhaps she is emptied out.

   Carrie almost mouths:CARRIEMomma...

   It is a little child's voice and there is no answer.

   She goes out into the hallway.327 INT. HALLWAY � NIGHTCarrie goes to the head of the stairs. Once again, she mouths the words:121CARRIEMomma...

   Something � a movement? An instinct? -- makes her turn. She sees:328 MARGARETComing toward her.329 CARRIEShe flings out her arms and cries out:CARRIEOh, Momma!

   And throws herself against her mother, holds her. A movement from Margaret, a quick
   movement, hard to define. And Carrie recoils, her hands clutching her stomach.

   Briefly we see the knife in Margaret's hand.

   Then Carrie tumbles down the stairs.330 ANGLE DOWN STAIRSOn Carrie, lying like a broken doll, huddled at the foot of the stairs.331 MARGARETCarrying the knife, she stares down the stairs.MARGARETIt says in the Lord's Book: `Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.'332 CARRIEDazed, she sees her mother coming, dimly, everything distorted.

   stairs.MARGARETAnd now the devil has come home.122CARRIE(whimpering)
                  Momma, it's not right.

   Carrie starts crawling to the kitchen.333 INT. KITCHEN � NIGHTCarrie crawls farther and farther from the door, until she reaches the far end of the kitchen,
   just as Margaret, the knife gleaming in her hand, pointed toward Carrie, reaches the bottom of
   the stairs and turns toward the kitchen, mumbling all the while.

   Carrie flexes: the kitchen door swings shut.

   Margaret is coming toward the kitchen.

   Carrie flexes again � to hold the door shut.

   But it's no use � Margaret is relentless now, and the door opens. She raises the knife and
   starts toward Carrie, the door swinging behind her.MARGARETI should have killed you when you were born.CARRIEMomma, I love you. Please help me!MARGARETSin never dies.

   There's nothing else to be done. Carrie flexes, and a serving fork � dangling from a hook on
   the way � suddenly hurtles through the air, piercing Margaret. It is followed by another and
   another as a rain of instruments strikes Margaret.

   Margaret collapses.

   Carrie, horrified by what she's done, starts toward her mother.

   And then she and we see Sue standing in the doorway, clasping her hand to her mouth, stifling
   her screams.CARRIEYou. You tricked me.123SUENo.CARRIEGet out.SUEWe were just trying to...CARRIEGet out.

And then something hits the roof, rattling. A small sound. A stone.

Then another.

Then a third.CARRIEGet out! Get out!

The stones are beginning to rain on the roof, like hail.

Sue is rooted to the spot, terrified.CARRIEGet out, get out, get out!

The stones are coming down harder. All sound as one or two of them break through the roof,
rattle on the floor below.CARRIEGET OUT!A stone of fairly small size crashes through into the kitchen.

Carrie flexes.

And Sue stumbles backwards toward the door.

   being packed.

   Eleanor Snell, looking incredibly tired, is attending to the last-minute details of moving. She
   sorts through magazines and books, discarding some, putting others into cartons. And she
   comes across the religious tracts left behind by Margaret White, forgotten until now. They
   have a momentary hypnotic effect on her.

   The phone RINGS, startling her. She rushes to answer it in the kitchen, catching it on the first
   or second ring.ELEANOR(hushed voice)

                  to forget it in time. Knock wood.

   As Eleanor's side of the conversation continues, the camera conveys her tension. Half of her
   is listening and talking to Betty; the rest of her mind is on Sue upstairs. With good reason.
   Because:126343 EXT. EMPTY LOT � DAYWhere the Horan house used to stand, now vacant. Strewn with beer cans, overgrown with
   grass and weeds and wildflowers. And a FOR SALE sign.

   We PAN over next door where the White house used to stand. It, too, is vacant but utterly
   bald � there's been no time for anything to grow here. There is another FOR SALE sign put
   up by Born Realty.344 SUE SNELLlooking utterly haggard and perhaps a bit on the loony side from a lack of sleep stands staring
   at the lot. She's standing there in her white nightgown, barefoot.345 THE WHITE LOT � SUE'S POVas she slowly walks toward it. Underwater, almost floating. We come closer on the sign
   which now starts appearing a bit odder � less like a simple FOR SALE sign and more like a
   grave marker.

   And when we get close enough, we see that some graffiti has been hastily scrawled in chalk
   on the sign:CARRIE WHITE IS BURNING IN HELL FOR HER SINSAnd below it, in a second vandal's handwriting, some idiot's notion of one final joke:JESUS NEVER FAILS346 SUEas she kneels down, putting the wreath she's carrying next to the marker. She proceeds to try
   to wipe off the red chalk with the palm of her hand; it smudges badly.

   She stares at her hand, fixating on it, remembering Carrie in the shower. Suddenly, a second
   hand thrusts into frame, onto her nightgown.

   A bloody hand.

   A hand from the Earth itself.

   Carrie's hand

   It clutches a horrified Sue by the wrist. Tightly. A vice.127Sue begins screaming uncontrollably. The hand is trying to pull her into the ground. Her

   And we come in close on Sue's stricken face as her mother holds her, calming her, cradling
   her. Closer still on Sue's eyes. She closes them, and we go to:BLACK
