      thousand screams in agony.

      From the blackness, gusts of smoke pull together
      quickly, forming the Main Title against black:"EVIL DEAD"Then beneath it, the Roman Numeral "II."

      A SLOW ZOOM brings it toward us.  And as the screams
      reach their sharp crescendo the title zooms through us.FADE IN:1     ANGLE - STOP MOTION ANIMATION                         1Whisping smoke against a black background. EERIE
      MUSIC.  In the distance, through the smoke, a
      small object. It fans toward us quickly, filling the
      frame. It is an ancient skin covered volume, with
      the outline of a human face on it's cover. This is
      the Book of the Dead.NARRATORLegend has it, that it was written by
               the dark ones:NECRONOMICONEXMORTES;
               Roughly translated...The Book of the Dead.

      The face on the cover of the book pulls away from its
      skin binding and leans toward the camera. EYES
      on the book blink open and peer at us. It's mouth
      opens and emits a hideous scream. The CAMERA races
      into the blackness of the screaming mouth.DISSOLVE THRU TO:1P    PLATE FOR PREVIOUS SCENE - SMOKE                      1P2     A SPINNING VORTEX - (3 PAINTINGS ON AN ANIMATION      2STAND) - 12 SEC. PLATESpiraling downward.NARRATORTo trace the origin of the Book, we
               must go back...back...to a day when
               spirits ruled the earth.

      Faster and faster the pages turn on the Book as the
      blood red ink is scrawled across them. The pages flip
      furiously until the Book snaps shut, reveal ing its
      gruesome face on the cover.

      The book flaps violently away from camera.NARRATOR (V.O.)The Book of the Dead was last seen

      An ox grazes nearby.  4 Warriors on horseback in the BG.NARRATOR (V.O.)It was then that the dark spirits
               again rose up to battle the living.

      The ground in front of the castle begins to split apart.
      A red glow and smoke pour from the growing crevice.
      Something evil is being unleashed.  A strong wind kicks
      up blowing sand in a furious rage.5A    EXT. KANDAR CASTLE - DUSK                             5ATRACKING SHOT - ASHThrough the blowing silt, a lone figure appears.  An
      image of power and light.  His clothing is ragged,
      and he holds what appears to be a jagged toothed
      longsword.  Two massive columns of stone stand on
      either side.  CAMERA slowly moves closer, but his face
      is still hidden by the darkness and blowing sands.NARRATOR (V.O.)It is said that a hero came from the
               sky.  A man who defeated this evi and
               buried the Book in the Castle of Kandar.

      petrified skeletal remains stand in a weathered heap.NARRATOR (V.O.)...Waiting.

      A four wheel drive vehicle roars PAST THE CAMERA and
      toward the castle.7     INT. CASTLE OF KAN DAR - DAY - (STUDIO)               7TRACKING SHOTThe CAMERA slowly tracks in toward the Book of the
      Dead as it sits in the darkness of the stone tomb.
      Next to it rests the KANDARIAN DAGGER, an ancient
      knife, its handle fashioned from the skull of a
      weasel. They rest upon a small pedestal covered
      with cobwebs. Prominently displayed on the stone wall,
      a bas relief of the "Hero from the Sky" holding his
      unusual jagged edged weapon.NARRATOR (V.O.)And then...

      The grinding of rock scraping against rock is heard,
      and a large stone is swung open on a secret hinge in
      the wall behind the book. Wind sweeps in through the
      tomb, along with the blinding light from outside. A
      sharply silhouetted figure steps in the newly created
      doorway. The figure lights a torch that he holds,
      illuminating his face.  This is PROFESSOR RAYMOND
      KNOWBY.  An intelligent, grey bearded man in his late
      fifties. He lowers the cloth around his face that had
      been protecting him from the sand.  He stares at the
      Book, awestruck.

      Behind him, two other figures appear in the entrance of
      the tomb. The first is a large school-marmish woman,
      the wife of Raymond Knowby, HENRIETTA. She moves to
      Raymond's side and takes his hand.  Immediately behind
      her is their daughter, ANNIE KNOWBY; twenty-four years
      old, strong stance and beautiful.  Behind her a
      handsome looking man, ED GETLY, enters the tomb.  He
      moves to Annie's side.  They exchange excited glances.

               HENRIETTA, brought the book to a small
               cabin where they could study it

      transcribes passages from the Book of the Dead.  A
      small framed photograph of his daughter Annie sits
      upon the table.  Behind him, HENRIETTA sits knitting in
      a rocking chair.11    CLOSE SHOT - RAYMOND                                  11He speaks the phonetic pronunciation of completed

      The sound of RAYMOND reciting the passages is faded
      down AS THE CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS away from RAYMOND and
      over to HENRIETTA as she rocks back into the darkness
      and forward into the light.  As she rocks forward into
      the light, she comes into FULL CLOSEUP revealing that her
      eyes have changed to a milky white.  She continues to
      knit.DISSOLVE THRU TO:12    INT. STUDIO - BLACK                                   12MED. SHOT - FOGBlowing past the camera in front of black drape.DISSOLVE THRU TO:13    INT. CABIN CELLAR - NIGHT (STUDIO)                    13A dank fruit cellar with shelves of half-rotten

      He is dictating into the tape recorder, sweating and
      distraught.RAYMONDIt has only been a few hours since
               I've translated and spoke aloud the first
               of the demon resurrection passages from
               the Book of the Dead.

      The sound of heavy footsteps.  Dust drifts down INTO
      FRAME.  Raymond looks up to the ceiling of the cellar.
      It is also the floor to the main room of the cabin.
      He watches in horror as Henrietta's silhouette paces the
      floor above him.  And then, the footsteps halt.RAYMONDAnd now, I fear that my wife has become
               host to a Kandarian demon.  May God forgive
               me for what I have unleashed onto this
               earth.13Y   REVERSE ACTION                                        13YThe milky eyed possessed figure of HENRIETTA jolts quickly

      delicate silver necklace.14C   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH AND LINDA                           14CA handsome young man, ASH, is playing the waltz music

      falls away from us.  We approach the front door. SLAM! It
      jigsaws in two and we are again outside, now in front of

      "G" force is distorting Ash's face as he is rocketed
      backwards.  He is swept hand over foot through the
      air.  He reaches the edge of the woods and begins
      tearing through the branches and smaller trees,

      Then in a burst, it too, erupts in a hellish fire hose.
      It spouts blood under such great pressure that ASH is
      driven against the walls of the cabin because of it.269   MED. SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS                           269We follow him as he slams from one wall into another.270   CLOSE SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS                          270In the midst of his scream, drowning in the blood, it

The CAMERA PANS TO Ash.  He stands
      alone on a small pile of rubble clutching his smoldering
      shotgun.  He looks about dazedly.  He tries to get his
      bearings.692   WIDE SHOT - WARRIORS                                  692They falter.  Unsure of how to react to this strange
      man, who a moment before was pronounced a Deadite.
      From the crowd, the Warrior #1 calls out:WARRIOR #1Hail he, who has come from the sky,
               to deliver us from the terrors of
               the deadites!WARRIOR #4Hail!WARRIOR #5Hail!

      The cry is taken up by all. A line of medieval warriors
      bow.  Then twenty.  Then fifty.  All remove their
      helmets and kneel silently in the dust.

      Somewhere in the distance a DRUM SOUNDS.  Ash stands
      frozen.  Terrified, unsure of where or when he is.
      Knowing only for the present, he is alive.

      As the wind kicks up blowing dust, Ash strikes a
      familiar pose.  It is the same image of the "Hero
      from the Sky" that we saw earlier in the film.  The
      strange "jagged edged longsword" is Ash's chainsaw.

      The CAMERA PULLS BACK from him as a great medieval castle
      rears up INTO FRAME.  It is seen to be the castle of
      Kandar.  The same castle we saw in the beginning of the
      film.  Now, however, the castle is not a ruin, but brand
      new.  As the CAMERA continues to pull back from Ash, the
      title "EVIL DEAD" appears on the screen acompanied by
      the distant ROAR of some dying animal:  The SCREEN cuts
      to BLACK WITH A THUNDEROUSBOOM.THEEND
