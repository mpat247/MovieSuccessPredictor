That's wrong.ANTHONYDignan, it's --DIGNANPlus where's Huggie Bear?ANTHONYHe's not there. Huggie Bear isn't
            in every single episode.DIGNANI think you might of dreamed this
            one, Anthony.ANTHONYNo. It's a real episode. The killer
            is leading him across the city by
            calling different pay phones.

They climb over a high wooden fence.EXT. BACKYARD. DAYThey walk through somebody's backyard.DIGNANWhy?ANTHONYAs part of his plan. I don't know
            why.DIGNANSee, that's what I'm saying. It has
            the logic of a dream.ANTHONYThe point is the killer always
            goes, May I speak to Starsky? He
            says his name.DIGNAN(pause)
            What does Starsky say?ANTHONYHe says. This is he.DIGNANThis is he?ANTHONYNo. This is he.

They climb another fence. There's big house on the other side.INT. HOUSE. DAYAnthony and Dignan are inside walking through the foyer.
Anthony goes up the stairway quickly and quietly.

Dignan walks to the master bedroom. Goes in the closet and
grabs a box. Looks inside. Dumps it into his bag.

Anthony goes into a bedroom. Looks in a dresser and takes
out two watches. Digs through some socks and finds some cash.

Dignan goes in the study. Opens a drawer and closes it.
Opens another and lifts out a set of thin leather coin books.

Anthony's in a kid's room. Looking at posters of a football
player and John McEnroe on the walls. He grabs a walkman and
a calculator. Then suddenly stops moving. He crouches down.
Looks at a shelf of dozens of little metal soldiers. They're
in formations with different uniforms.

Dignan is walking down the hallway as Anthony comes down the
stairs. They walk to the door and go out.INT. DINER. DAYA twenty-four hour diner. Anthony and Dignan are eating at
the counter.ANTHONYDid you see what I meant about the
            window?DIGNANKind of. Except we've already got
            the keys.ANTHONYThat's true. But what if they
            change the locks?DIGNANWould they do that?ANTHONYWho knows? That's why I filed it
            down.

Dignan nods.ANTHONYNow that window can never be locked.
            It's impossible.DIGNANSee, your mind is very good with
            the more mechanical details.
            Whereas my strength would be --

A good-looking WOMAN about forty-five years old interrupts
them.WOMANCan I use your Tabasco?ANTHONYSure.

Anthony hands her a bottle of Tabasco off the counter. She
walks away. Down the counter.ANTHONYYou don't see many women who like
            Tabasco.

They watch her for a minute. Dignan looks away.ANTHONYShe's really kind of hot.DIGNAN(looks back at her, nods)
            She's an attractive older woman.EXT. BOB'S HOUSE. DAYA huge house with a wide lawn. BOB, who's about twenty-six,
wearing black jeans and a V-neck T-shirt, is spraying down a
battered 1972 Mercedes with a garden hose. He's got his
shirt off and a towel around his neck. Dignan has an
expression of intense concentration as he looks at the car.BOBWell, what do you think?DIGNANI don't know, Bob. What about one
            of those?

Dignan points to a new BMW and a Lexus in front of the garage.BOBI'm not allowed to drive those.DIGNANNot even for emergencies?BOB(a little angry)
            No.DIGNANI thought your parents were in Italy.BOBThey are.DIGNANSo who's going to know?BOBMy brother.ANTHONYFuture Man.BOBWho?ANTHONYFutute Man. You know. Cause he
            looks like he's from the future.DIGNANHe looks like he was designed by
            scientists. For desert warfare.BOBThat never would of --DIGNANLet's cut the bullshit.

Silence. They all look at the car. Pause.ANTHONYIt's got a V-8, Dignan.DIGNANWhat do you think the cops have?INT. BOB'S HOUSE. DAYThey're sitting at the coffee table in Bob's great big
living room. It's got high ceilings and two Persian rugs.
They're eating sandwiches and chips.BOBIf you're that worried, maybe we
            should just steal one.DIGNANWhat are you talking about, Bob?BOBCan you use a coaster.

Bob slides a coaster under Dignan's glass.ANTHONYDid you ever steal a car bdfore?BOBYeah. I've stolen two cars before.
            One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With
            T-Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to
            drive.DIGNANYou stole a Trans-Am.BOBYes. I did.DIGNANOK, Bob.BOBIt's true, Dignan.DIGNANWell. What do you want to do? You
            want to steal one or just drive
            your car?BOB(thinks for a minute)
            I'll just drive my car.INT. DELI. DAYAnthony's playing pinball at a machine in the back of a
little grocery store. Dignan's watching.DIGNANAnthony, we'll get two hundred for
            the coin collection alone. That's
            less than what it's appraised at.ANTHONYBut Dignan, do you really know that
            much about rare coins?DIGNANI know about money, Anthony. I know
            the value of money. Plus the
            earrings are worth three times that.

Anthony looks at Dignan. Dignan points at the pinball machine.DIGNANYour ball.

Dignan tries to hit the flipper.ANTHONYI told you not to take the earrings.

Anthony keeps looking at Dignan. Dignan doesn't look up from
the machine. Anthony turns and walks away.DIGNANYou got another ball.

Dignan watches him go.DIGNANI'm playing your game.EXT. SIDEWALK. DAYThey're walking fast down the sidewalk.ANTHONYThe list, Dignan. I know you
            remember the list because you
            signed it. "Things Dignan was not
            supposed to touch."DIGNANEvery valuable item in the house
            was on that list.ANTHONYThat doesn't make any difference. I
            bought those earrings for my mother
            on her birthday. They have a very
            special value for her.DIGNANYeah, but I can't be sorting
            through that shit in the middle of
            a burglary. There's just not time
            for it.ANTHONYThen you shouldn't of gone in
            there, Dignan. Maybe we should of
            robbed your house. Did you ever
            think of that?

Dignan stops walking. Anthony looks back at him. Pause.ANTHONYWhat?

Dignan turns and starts walking the other way.ANTHONYWhere are you going?DIGNANI don't appreciate you ridiculing me.ANTHONYHow was I ridiculing you?DIGNANYou're making fun of my family. You
            know there's nothing to steal from
            my mom and Craig. You know exactly
            what you're saying.ANTHONYThat's not what I meant, Dignan.

They both see something. They keep walking. Dignan looks
back down the sidewalk.DIGNANDid you see that?ANTHONYYeah, I saw it.DIGNANI'm lookout.ANTHONYDignan, it's got an alarm.DIGNANI don't think so. Just reach on in.ANTHONYThat sets it off.DIGNANNo, just do it real quick.
                   (starts down the sidewalk)
            I'll meet you down there.

Dignan cuts into an alley. Anthony turns back. Looks at a
parked car. Looks left and right. Walks to the car and
reaches in the half-open window.

An alarm goes off. Anthony unlocks the door and opens it.
Leans inside. Grabs a wallet off the seat.

A MAN standing on the sidewalk watches Anthony get out of
the car. Anthony looks at him, then walks down the sidewalk
not too fast. He turns down an alley and runs.EXT. ALLEY. DAYAnthony comes around the corner and meets Dignan beside a
dumpster. The alarm is still ringing in the distance.
Anthony starts looking through the wallet.ANTHONYIt had an alarm.DIGNANYeah, I heard that.ANTHONY(counting the money)
            Five, seven, eight dollars.

He looks at Dignan.DIGNAN(taking the wallet)
            Holy shit. What'd I tell you?ANTHONYEight dollars.DIGNANThat's not bad.

Anthony keeps looking at Dignan. Dignan smiles. He hands
Anthony a five dollar bill. Anthony looks at it. He takes it.
He puts it in his pocket. Dignan puts out his hand to shake.
Anthony waits a second. He shakes Dignan's hand for just a
second and walks down the alley. Dignan smiles and walks
behind him.INT. HAMBURGER PLACE. NIGHTAnthony and Dignan are sitting at a table with Bob.ANTHONYWhat do herbs have to do with it? I
            don't understand the --BOBPot is an herb. It's just like any
            type of gardening.DIGNANHow much could you grow?
            Realistically.BOBAs much as I want. When these
            plants bud I'll probably have about
            six thousand dollars worth of weed.DIGNANSix thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.BOBYou should take a look. I have an
            entire crop in my backyard.ANTHONYIn your backyard? How do you
            protect them?BOBIt's private property. Plus I have
            Hector.ANTHONYHector woudn't do anything.BOBBut he's got a loud bark. That's
            the most important thing is a loud
            bark.DIGNANIf it's that easy why doesn't
            everybody grow them?BOBGood question.

Bob looks at Anthony and Dignan. He suddenly gets worried.BOBDon't you guys tell anybody about
            my plants.DIGNANYou're paranoid, Bob.BOBYeah, but don't tell anybody.ANTHONYCould you grow cinnamon?BOBI don't know. Sure, I guess.ANTHONYYou could make your own cinnamon
            toast.

Bob looks at Anthony for a second. He looks at Dignan. Back
at Anthony.BOBAre you a fag?LITTLE RICHARDYou're the faggot.

Bob turns around to see LITTLE RICHARD, short but muscular,
wearing a down vest and a baseball cap.BOBLittle Richard. I don't believe it.
            They'll let anybody in this place.
            Sit down.

Little Richard sits down.BOBDignan and Anthony, this is Little
            Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.LITTLE RICHARD(smiling)
            I don't know about that.BOBLittle Richard. Trust me. You're
            insane. Jesus, this guy used to
            carry a percussion bomb around in
            his trunk. You do not want a guy
            like that loose on the streets.LITTLE RICHARDIt seemed like a good idea at the
            time.BOBThe one and only Little Richard.DIGNANAre you named after THE Little
            Richard?LITTLE RICHARD(stares at Dignan)
            Ha! Ha! Ha! Why don't you stick it
            up your ass. Great group of guys
            you're hanging out with.

Little Richard goes out the door.DIGNANWhat was that all about?BOBI can't believe you said that.DIGNANWhat did I say?BOBI told you he's crazy.ANTHONYBut he didn't say anything.DIGNANHang on a second.

Dignan gets up and walks out of the restaurant. Anthony and
Bob look at each other. They start to get up.EXT. HAMBURGER PLACE. NIGHTAnthony and Bob go out the door. Dignan is walking over to a
station wagon. Little Richard is getting in.DIGNANLittle Richard. Wait a second. Hang
            on. I didn't mean to --

Little Richard opens his door hard into Dignan's legs, then
gets out fast and takes off his shirt. Dignan tries to hit
him but doesn't connect. They grab onto each other and start
knocking around. Another GUY gets out of the station wagon.
Two more GUYS rush out the door of the burger place. Anthony
and Bob stand back, nervous.ANTHONYLet them fight.BOBLet them fight.

They all watch. Dignan keeps trying to punch Little Richard,
but he's hanging onto him too tight. They keep spinning
around together, moving down the sidewalk.DIGNAN(calling out)
            Anthony.

Anthony looks at the other guys then moves toward Dignan.ANTHONYOK. Break it up. Break it up.

Little Richard lets go of Dignan. They separate.DIGNANI separated my shoulder.

Dignan is holding onto his arm. He kind of moans.ANTHONYOK. Hang on.

Anthony grabs hold of Dignan's arm. Everybody's watching.DIGNANJust pull straight up.
Anthony pulls up hard on Dignan's arm. Dignan tries not to
yell, then suddenly he's OK and relieved.ANTHONYIs it back in?DIGNAN(moving arm slowly)
            Yeah.GUY #1OK, man. Let's go.DIGNANNo. I'm not fighting anymore.ANTHONYHis shoulder went out, man. It's
            over.GUY #2You guys better get out of here.

Guy #2 pushes Dignan. Anthony turns and pounds him in the
face. Right on the nose. The guy goes crosseyed. He falls
down with his legs all tangled-up in a strange position.

Everyone stands there stunned. Anthony takes a step back. He
looks up. He and Dignan take off. Bob stands there. Frozen.
Everyone looks at him. Bob looks at Little Richard.LITTLE RICHARDBob?

Bob takes off.INT. CAR. DAYThe next day. They're driving with Bob. Dignan's up front.
He's banged-up from the fight.DIGNANThe guy is fucking insane.BOBI warned you, Dignan.DIGNANYou said it like it was a big joke,
            Bob. Like he's wild.BOBNo, I was saying crazy like a
            lunatic.DIGNANI know that now. He's a fucking
            psycho.BOBWell, don't blame me. I told you.DIGNANI do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look
            at her.

There's a beautiful GIRL on the sidewalk. They drive past her.DIGNANLoop around real fast.ANTHONYJust turn right here.

Bob immediately turns and they drive past the girl again.
They don't say anything as they go past her. They all just
look at her. They drive on.CUT TO:A minute later. They've looped back. They're looking for the
girl.DIGNANWhere'd she go?BOBMaybe she turned.ANTHONYThere she is.

She's on a side street. Bob hits the brakes hard. The girl
looks back at them. They back up a few feet and turn down
the street. They drive slowly toward the girl.ANTHONYBob, don't be so obvious.

The girl keeps looking back at them.DIGNANI think we might of scared her.BOBLet's just go.

They come up, beside the girl. She looks right at them,
still walking.

Her expression is angry and also a little scared.

They drive away.DIGNANYou blew it, Bob.INT. COFFEE SHOP. DAYAnthony, Dignan, and Bob are meeting with TEMPLE. Temple is
in his mid-fifties, short, heavy, completely expressionless
wide face. They listen intently as he briefs them on the
intricacies of firearms.TEMPLEA gun is a firearm. A pistol is a
            firearm. But anything you hold in
            your hand is a weapon. A knife. A
            wrench. A ballpoint pen.ANTHONYA ballpoiht pen?TEMPLEAnyone who tells you a ballpoint
            pen is not a weapon needs intensive
            psychiatric treatment. You can
            stick them in the esophagus. You
            give them a ballpoint tracheotomy.

They nod seriously. Temple laughs.EXT. FIELD. DAYThey're standing behind Temple's car in the middle of an
open pasture. The trunk is open. Temple's got some guns in
metal cases. They draw targets on pieces of paper. Anthony
draws a man running on his target. They fire a bunch of
different pistols. The last one they shoot's a .44 Magnum.
They buy it.INT. BOB'S HOUSE. DAYThe TV room. There are two big couches and a nice giant TV.
The doors are open onto the balcony. The .44 is on the
coffee table. Dignan is sitting there with a map and some
diagrams laid out. Anthony and Bob are on either side of him.
Dignan's pointing at a notebook page with the heading
"Escape Route."DIGNANOK. Escape route. The most important
            thing you can have is an escape
            route. Just in case somebody's
            tailing us. Or even chasing us, as
            the case may be --ANTHONYYou think we're going to be chased?DIGNANThat's a good question. No. I don't.
            I'm just being hypocritical here.
            However, I will say --

Bob reaches for the .44.BOB(quietly)
            I'm going to take a look at this.DIGNAN(puts hand on gun)
            Hang on This is important, Bob.
            Anthony and I are responsible for
            the internal situation. The money
            and the people. You're responsible
            for the external situation. The
            streets and the getaway.BOB(nods)
            That's my responsibility.DIGNANThat's your domain.BOBOK.Anthony is making a little man out of a scrap of paper.DIGNANNow. One thing we need to discuss
            is timing. Timing is absolutely
            crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!ANTHONY(looks up)
            Nothing. Go ahead.

Bob picks up the gun.BOB(to himself)
            How many bullets can that hold?

Dignan grabs the gun away and sets it down out of Bob's reach.DIGNANBob.BOBI'm paying attention. I just want
            to look at it for a minute.DIGNAN(screaming)
            What's your fucking problem? You're
            a shithead!BOBI just want to see how much bullets
            it takes.

Anthony picks up the gun off the table. He clicks the action.DIGNANAnthony, give me the fucking gun!ANTHONY(pulling away)
            No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's
            all of ours.BOB(quietly)
            I paid for it.DIGNANGod DAMMIT.

Dignan stands up, grabbing his papers.DIGNANYou two just don't give a shit, do
            you?

Dignan starts out of the room. Anthony stands up.ANTHONYDignan, calm down.DIGNAN(turns back, screaming)
            You're out! I'm not working with
            either one of you!ANTHONYDignan! Stop!

Dignan stops. Looking at Anthony.ANTHONYCalm down. Take a deep breath.DIGNAN(pause)
            You're right. You're right.

Dignan sits back down and starts spreading out his papers
again. Freezes. Looks at Bob. Bob's looking at the gun. Bob
looks at Dignan. Bob looks away. Nobody moves.EXT. DECK. EVENINGAnthony and Dignan have moved outside to the hot tub.
Anthony pets Bob's dog HECTOR. Bob's brother FUTURE MAN
walks up the path from the driveway with his blonde
cheerleader GIRLFRIEND.FUTURE MANWhat are you guys doing?ANTHONYNothing. We're just --FUTURE MANYou seen my brother?DIGNANHe's inside.

Future Man goes inside. His girlfriend stands there on the
deck.GIRLFRIEND(smiles)
            Hi.ANTHONY & DIGNANHi.

She stands there, looking across the yard. Anthony and
Dignan sit there in the hot tub, looking around. We hear
Future Man's loud voice inside:FUTURE MANGoddammit, Bob! Get your shit
            together.

Future Man comes back out. He stops by the hot tub.FUTURE MANWhat are you guys up to tonight?ANTHONYNothing much.DIGNANJust hanging around.

Future Man walks back out the gate.GIRLFRIENDBye.

She follows Future Man. Anthony and Dignan watch them walk
away. Bob comes back out with some drinks. He looks shaken.DIGNANWhat'd Future Man want?

Bob shrugs and gets in the hot tub. They sip on their drinks.
Bob's got a Heineken.BOBHe doesn't get it. Held never
            understand what we're trying to
            accomplish here. It's too dangerous
            for him.DIGNANWell, in reality it's not that
            dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous
            if you don't know what you're doing.BOBYeah, but what if some nut pulled
            gun on you?ANTHONYThe only nut with a gun is going to
            be Dignan.

Anthony gets out of the hot tub and dives in the pool.DIGNAN(whispering, very serious)
            You know, Bob, Anthony did kill
            someone. He electrocuted our
            janitor senior year.BOBHe electrocuted someone?DIGNANIt was an accidental. I don't want
            to go into the details. It was just
            one of those senior pranks that
            didn't really go right. I mean,
            obviously, since Swifty's dead.
            That's why Anthony never graduated.BOBHis name was Swifty?DIGNANYeah. One of the nicest old guys
            you'd ever know.BOBThat's too bad.DIGNAN(nods)
            You know, when somebody gets
            electrocuted, their skin starts
            smoking. At least Swifty's did.INT. CAR. NIGHTAnthony, Dignan, and Bob are sitting in Bob's car, parked in
the dark. Bob's at the wheel. Anthony and Dignan are in the
back. Anthony has on a dark blue ski cap. Dignan's wearing a
baseball cap with the brim pulled down low. He puts a piece
of adhesive tape across his nose and hands the roll to
Anthony.BOBWhat are you doing?DIGNANI'm putting a piece of tape on my
            nose.

Anthony tapes his nose. They stare out the windshield. The
alarm on Dignan's digital watch goes off.DIGNAN(immediately, dead serious)
            Let's get lucky.EXT/INT. BOOKSTORE. NIGHTAnthony and Dignan walk through the shadows in front of a
huge bookstore. The lights are on inside. They watch for a
minute and then go to the front door. Dignan hides behind a
post. Anthony knocks on the glass. An EMPLOYEE appears.ANTHONYI left my sweater inside.

The employee shakes his head. He can't hear through the glass.ANTHONYDo you have a lost and found?

The employee unlocks the door and opens it an inch.EMPLOYEEWe're closed.ANTHONYI left my sweater in there.EMPLOYEEOh. I see. Come on in.

Anthony goes inside. Dignan comes out from behind the post.EMPLOYEEWe're closed, sir.DIGNANWhere's that guy going?EMPLOYEEHe left his sweater.DIGNANWell, I left some money in there.EMPLOYEEWhere?DIGNAN(pulls out the gun)
            In the cash relister. Step away
            from the door.

Dignan goes in. They walk through the store.ANTHONYWhere's the manager?DIGNANWhere's the other stocker?ANTHONYThere's another stocker, right?DIGNANWe know there's another stocker.EMPLOYEERob?

Dignan points the gun at the employee.DIGNANWhere is he? Where is Rob?EMPLOYEEI don't know. Maybe in literature.
            That's his section.DIGNANYou got that?ANTHONYSure. Literature. The classics.

The MANAGER is locking the door of his office.ANTHONYIs that the manager?DIGNAN(to manager)
            Unlock that door.
                   (to Anthony)
            Check the aisles.

Anthony starts walking through the store, checking down each
aisle. He picks up a copy of The Air War on Hitler's Germany
and takes it with him. He goes through literature and sees
ROB in travel, kneeling in front of a low shelf with a

is playing his electric guitar, not plugged in.DIGNANBob, will you please listen?BOBI don't want to talk about it.

Bob strums more intensely. They're walking through the
kitchen.DIGNANLook, I admit I was wrong for not
            telling you before the robbery that
            your share wouldn't be as equal as
            ours. But the fact remains me and
            Anthony were much more exposed to
            danger.

Bob has now come to the big glass patio doors where Hector
sits outside, looking in. Bob keeps playing as he looks at
Hector.DIGNANI mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You

Bob stops playing. He looks at Dignan.BOBYou'll probably have them the rest
            of your life.ANTHONYWhat was that?

Later. It's dark out now. There's a police car parked across
the street and another pulling over, lights rolling. One of
the OFFICERS walks across the yard, shining a flashlight in
the bushes. Dignan is talking with one of the other officers.DIGNANHe was probably on drugs.OFFICERThey usually are.

Two other cops are getting a statement from Phil. Anthony
and Bob are listening. Some neighbors are milling around
talking.PHILAs soon as I opened the door I saw
            him. A black guy. Looking through
            my dad's tool box. I wanted to trap
            this guy. So I closed the garage

                   and concentrating)
            He struck me. I fell down. He took
            my wallet. Then he opened the

Dignan and the officer are walking over to the backyard.DIGNANNo, it was a rustling sound.BOB'S VOICEThe dog. Look out for the dog.OFFICERIs this dog going to bite?DIGNANNo. Shit no.

flashlight. Dignan's petting Hector. Hector's calm.DIGNANSee? I don't know what he's talking
            about.

street. They see Dignan come racing down the driveway. The
officer is yelling behind the gate.OFFICERBill! He's running!

The other officers are running from their cars.DIGNANThe prowler! That way!

The officers run past Dignan, toward the back. Anthony and
Bob take off as Dignan runs by. The three of them run full
speed down the street, cutting across yards, between houses.

seconds. The guy in the car sticks hi s hand out the window
and shoots the finger at them. Dignan sounds dead serious:DIGNANRam him, Bob.

Bob waits for a nervous moment. He does two quick honks. The
guy's reverse lights go on.DIGNANHit him!

Bob hits the gas and slams into the car. He puts his car in
reverse and backs up a couple of feet. He leans forward and
sees the back of the guy's car. It's all smashed up. The guy
gets out of his car, shaken up, and looks at them. His
expression is confused. Bob punches it and flies backwards
down the street. The guy stands beside his car and watches

Bob glares at Dignan. Dignan shrugs. The waitress brings
over some glasses of water, ice clinking. Nobody says
anything while she sets them down. She walks away.BOBGive me the keys, Dignan.DIGNANI can't do that, Bob.BOBDignan. You're going to give me

sidewalk, staring straight ahead. Dignan's, got his window
down.DIGNANLook, Bob. I understand your
            loyalty. You're a good person. But
            right now you're not using your
            best judgement.

Bob keeps walking.DIGNANFuture Man would not want you to go
            to jail I promise you. Just get in
            the car and we'll talk about it.

No reaction. Bob keeps walking straight ahead.DIGNANFuture Man would never go to jail

            know why? Because I don't care.
            He's Future Man. But I care about
            you. And to me it doesn't make
            sense to go back to the scene of a
            crime. Will you get in the car, Bob?
            This is stupid.

Bob stops walking.BOBIt's not your decision and he's not
            your brother, Dignan.DIGNANThat's right. I only have one vote.
            We'll go talk with Anthony and
            figure it out.

Pause. Bob gets into the backseat. Dignan looks back at him
for a minute.DIGNANYou're going to ride in the back?

Bob nods and looks out the window.DIGNANCome on, Bob. Get in front.

Bob exhales and gets out. He gets in up front. Dignan looks
at him for a minute.DIGNANYou've got a beautiful walk, Bob.BOBLet's go.INT. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHTDignan and Bob open the door and go in. Inside: Inez and two
other Hispanic MAIDS are sitting at the table by the window.
One's about seventeen and a little heavy, the other's in her
mid-thitties. There's a bunch of glasses and a bottle of rum
on the table. One of the maids is cutting up a banana. Inez
smiles at Dignan. Dignan looks puzzled.DIGNANHi. How's it going.

Suddenly there's a loud crunching, grinding sound. Dignan
and Bob are startled. They look around the room. The sound
stops.

Anthony comes out of the bathroom carrying the pitcher from
a blender. It's full to the top with yellow liquid. He sees
Dignan and Bob and stops. Pause.ANTHONYI thought you guys went to get your
            hair cut.DIGNANNo. We didn't.

Silence.ANTHONYWe're making banana daqueris.

Anthony holds up the pitcher. Dignan looks at it. Nods. Pause.ANTHONYThis is Inez. Carmen. Anita.DIGNANHi.ANTHONYInez, this is --DIGNANJerry.

housekeeping carts in the hall.DIGNANWhat the fuck is going on here?ANTHONYWhat. What's the matter?DIGNANAnthony, we're on the run from the
            law here. Did you tell these people

            out of jail in 48 hours, then we go
            back. All right?DIGNANNow that makes sense. We'll hang
            out for a couple of days. Get a
            little R&R. Make sure Future Man's
            OK and then get back on the road.ANTHONYAs long as he gets out OK.DIGNANObviously. That's a given.ANTHONYBob?BOBWhat?ANTHONYIs that OK?

Pause. Bob looks at Dignan. Looks at Anthony.BOB(shrugs)

They shake hands and start back to the room.DIGNANSee, now we've got a plan.ANTHONYDon't worry about it, Bob.INT. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHTAnthony, Dignan, Inez, Carmen, and Anita are sitting crowded
around the little table by the window in the motel room.
They've got banana daqueris and a bottle of wine. Moonlight
comes through the window. Bob is standing up in front of
them with a banana daqueri in his hand. He's singing a blues
number acapella. He's got a good voice.INT. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHTDignan and Bob are playing slapjack with Carmen and Anita.
Everyone's got their hands ready as  Carmen turns one card
then the next. Bob's having a conversation in fluent Spanish
with them about Las Vegas. He's talking about the rules at
different casinos: Bally's, Caesar's, the Desert Inn.
Dignan's paying close attention to the deck. A jack comes up
and he slams it.EXT. MOTEL POOL. NIGHTThere's a light in the pool. Anthony and Inez are swimming.
Anthony swims around her with his eyes just above the water.
He goes under and comes up grabbing onto her. She laughs.INEZDoes my skin feel soft, Anthony?ANTHONY(passionate)
            God, yes. Like silk.
Inez starts to giggle.ANTHONYWhat?
                   (starts laughing)
            What?INEZLike silk?ANTHONYGod. That does sound corny.  Oh,
            your skin feels so soft and silky.
            But it really kind of does.

He kisses her.DIGNANNo lifeguard on duty. Swim at your
            own risk.

They look up. Dignan's standng at the other side of the pool.
He smiles.DIGNANYou know, I did save Anthony from
            drowning once, Inez. Tell her,
            Anthony.CUT TO:Dignan sitting with his feet in the pool. Anthony and Inez
are sitting on the steps beside him, in the shallow end.DIGNANSee, one day we were playing hot
            box over at my next door neighbor
            Mr. Langston's house and Anthony
            fell in the pool and got knocked
            unconscious. I had to dive in and
            save him.ANTHONYThis was in fourth grade.DIGNANMr. Langston performed
            cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR.
            I've never said this before, but
            frankly I thought Anthony was dead.
            The veins in his face were all
            sticking out. His skin was blue. He
            truly did look dead.ANTHONYAfter that my parents never let me
            go to Dignan's again.DIGNANThey blamed my family for everything.
            They always said Mr. Langston saved
            Anthony's life.

Dignan stares wistfully across the pool. Anthony looks at
him for a minute.ANTHONYBut if it wasn't for Dignan I
            probably would of died.DIGNAN(nodding, whisper voice)
            Yes...It's true.

watching a war movie.EXT. MOTEL. DAYThe next morning. Dignan bursts out the door of the motel
room. He runs across the parking lot.DIGNANSon of a bitch.

Dignan runs back into the room. He comes out with Anthony.DIGNANHe's gone. He stole the car.ANTHONYWhere was it parked?DIGNANRight here.

Anthony looks around the parking lot.DIGNANThat coward. Son of a bitch.ANTHONYMaybe he just went to the store.DIGNANHe took his stuff. He's gone.
                   (pause)
            I should of seen this. I should of
            expected it. Bob doesn't have any
            character.

Anthony puts his hands in his pockets. Looks out at the
highway.ANTHONYHe went back for his brother.DIGNANWe said 48 hours.ANTHONYThat's a long time to be in jail.

They stand there in the empty parking lot. Anthony goes
inside.INT. MOTEL ROOM. DAYIn the room. The blinds are pulled. Anthony's sitting at the
end of a bed. Dignan's pacing around the room.DIGNANWe'll get him. Don't worry about
            that. We'll go back. We'll find him.
            And we'll blow up his car. Or do
            something. I promise you.

Anthony gets up and walks to the bathroom. He shuts the door.
Dignan follows him over to the sink and sits on the counter.DIGNANI mean, let's face it. Bob was dead
            weight. We're a lot better off
            without him.

Anthony opens the door and walks out.ANTHONYBob didn't steal the car. He told
            me he was going. He had to go help
            his brother.

Anthony sits back down on the bed. Dignan's shocked.DIGNANWhen'd he tell you?ANTHONYThis morning.DIGNANWhere was I?ANTHONYYou were asleep.DIGNANHe told you and you let him do it.ANTHONYHe told me because he wanted to

            more friends like you and Bob I'd
            be dead.ANTHONYIf you say so.INT. DINER. DAYAnthony and Dignan are sitting at a booth. Anthony's got a
roadmap spread out on the table. There's a long silence.DIGNANIf you'd gone with Bob you'd
            probably be in Weatherford by now.
            Of course I'd be here frantically
            worrying thinking you must of got
            kidnapped.ANTHONYI didn't realize you had such an
            incredible ability to feel sorry
            for yourself, Dignan.DIGNANWell, the world is a little bit
            colder today.

Anthony sits there thinking for a second, stating into space.
Then he looks back at his map. He draws some lines in two
different colors of felt tip pens.ANTHONYYou want to look at the map?

Pause. Dignan kind of looks at the map, without leaning
forward. Anthony turns the map more in Dignan's direction.
Dignan leans forward, looking.ANTHONYSee. Here's where we are.

They look at the map for a minute. Dignan looks out the
window.DIGNANI didn't know he had it in him.

goes around the side of the motel. He pulls off his jacket
as he goes up the stairs. He spots Inez's cart. He walks
over to the room she's cleaning. She's in there making the
bed. Anthony closes the door and grabs her by her belt.
She's laughing and he pushes her onto the bed. He unbuttons
her dress. She jerks a sheet out of the way. It swings in
the air.

Then we see Anthony and Inez walking down the sidewalk. He's
got one arm wrapped tight around her shoulders and she's got
hers around his waist. They're talking while they walk,
going past people in the town.

They watch each other walking reflected in a window.EXT. MOTEL. EVENINGDignan is doing the butterfly in the pool. Anthony and Inez
walk over and wait for him at the end of the pool.ANTHONYWe're going over to this bar if you
            feel like going.DIGNANNo. I'm going to swim. I'll see you
            later.

Dignan treads water. Inez looks at Anthony.ANTHONYWhy don't you come with us.DIGNANOK.Dignan gets out of the pool.INT. MEXICAN BAR. NIGHTAnthony, Dignan, and Inez are drinking beers with limes and
salt. The mood is good and they're getting drunk. Anthony
and Inez dance. Then Dignan and Inez. Mexican-style, stomping
their feet and clapping. There's a scruffy dog in the bar
and he barks at the dancers. Anthony kisses Inez and they
whisper to each other. Dignan orders another beer and moves
over to the pool table. A skinny Mexican MAN puts his arm
around Dignan's shoulder. He's drunk and slurring his words.
So's Dignan.MANHello, my friend. You in the Army,
            yes?DIGNANNo. I just have short hair.MANIs that your chiquita?DIGNANNo, my friend knows her.MANShe Chicano, yes?

Dignan nods.MANYou like Chicanos?DIGNANSure.

He says something in fast Spanish to the people at his table

Dignan looks over to the bar. Anthony and Inez are gone.DIGNANI don't know.MANShe is a good looking woman.

Dignan ignores this. They keep playing. Dignan finally makes
the eight ball. The man shakes Dignan's hand and holds on.DIGNANGuess I'll get another Tecate.MANSi. Tecate. You like to fight?DIGNANWhat?MANFight. You know.

He pulls Dignan in and with his other hand fakes a hard punch.DIGNANNo. Just pool.MANYou Hoto?DIGNAN(pulls away)

stands at the urinal, muttering to himself.

the Mexican man throw a hard punch. He hits Dignan in the
stomach, punches him in the face. Dignan goes down hard. The
guy kicks him and curses in Spanish.MANPinche cabrone. Puta madre.

The bartender comes in with a bat in his hand and starts
talking fast and angry in Spanish. The guy gets out.INT. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHTDignan's sitting in bed, watching TV. He's got a fat lip and
a big bruise over his eye. Anthony's sitting in a chair
beside him. Inez brings over a glass of water and some ice
in a washcloth. She gives the ice to Dignan for his eye. She
puts the glass of water on the nightstand where there's some
fast food layed out for Dignan: burger, fries, an apple pie.
Inez goes into the bathroom, closes the door, and turns on
the water. Anthony's sitting there with his hands clasped,
not looking at the TV.ANTHONYI can't believe he just jumped you.DIGNANCan you hand me those french fries.

Anthony hands him the fries. Dignan watches the TV.ANTHONYI wish I'd been there.DIGNANWould of been nice.

Anthony looks at Dignan.ANTHONYMan. I'm sorry. We just went for a
            walk --DIGNANI don't really feel like talking

hood open. Anthony's looking underneath the car. Dignan's
standing in the middle the road with his hands in his
pockets. No cars in sight.

Anthony starts messing around under the hood. He tests some
wires and connections. He steps away from the car.ANTHONYMan, I don't know anything about
            cars.

Dignan stares down the road.DIGNANYou really know how to pick them.

Dignan stares at Anthony. Pause.ANTHONYI had to give some to Inez.DIGNANHow much?ANTHONY$383.Dignan frowns slightly. Pause. He screams:DIGNANWhat!

Pause. Dignan runs at the car and kicks the door as hard as
he can. It makes a big dent. He runs down the shoulder and
grabs a big rock. He runs at the car and smashes the rock
through the windshield. He stands still. He turns to Anthony.
He walks back over to him, yelling.DIGNANYou gave $383 to the goddamn

on one knee. Dignan immediately turns and walks to the car.

Anthony stands up. He's got a bloody nose. He stares at
Dignan. Not angry. Just weary.

Dignan pulls his tennis bag out of the car. He shuts the
door and walks down the highway.

pulls it tight around his shoulders. He looks down the

            Yes. You just got to stick with it.

Bob looks down the fareway. He takes a deep breath and
starts walking toward his club about twenty yards away.INT. GOLF CART. DAYIn the cart. Bob's driving. There's a brief silence.BOBYou don't have to talk about it if
            you don't want to.ANTHONYNo, I don't mind.BOBI know it must of been a bad
            experience. But it doesn't sound
            like it was your fault.ANTHONYWell, I didn't mean to electrocute
            him. But the whole operation was my
            idea.

MONTAGE: Electronics wizardry. Splicing wires. Buzzing
electrodes. A filament lights up blue. Pliers and clippers
rewire a circuit breaker, short out the P.A. system,
electrify doors and windows. Anthony continues in VOICEOVER.ANTHONY (VO)It took six months of research. I
            did all the wiring myself. Switched
            AC to DC. Doubled the voltage.
            Shorted out the generator. The
            whole school was shut down.BOB (VO)That's pretty complicated for a
            senior prank.ANTHONY (VO)I don't like that word prank, Bob.
            I was trying to do something more
            than a prank.EXT. SCHOOL. DAYA large school building. Tall oak trees and benches in the
shade. Green and blue lights blink in the windows. White
flashes and loud jolts of energy dance from room to room.
Mozart plays in the distance.

Students begin to swarm out into the yard.ANTHONY (VO)I wanted to create an event.
            Something everyone would remember.
            And at first it worked perfectly.
            The whole school was standing
            around outside. Kids running all
            over the place. Everybody laughing.EXT. GOLF COURSE. DAYAnthony and Bob are standing on the seventeenth green.ANTHONYEven the school custodian Swifty
            thought it was great. He kept
            laughing and shaking his head the
            whole time he tried to disconnect
            the generator. And then suddenly
                   (snaps his finger)
            total silence except for Swifty
            hanging off the generator with his
            leg stuck to it being electrocuted.

Anthony stares down the fareway.ANTHONYActually he died of a heart attack
            brought on by the shock. He was an
            older guy.INT. GOLF CART. DAYAnthony and Bob are driving back to the clubhouse.ANTHONYI felt terrible. I'd known Swifty
            since first grade. He was Dignan's
            medicine man for Indian Guides.
            They called each other Rattlesnake
            and Killer Whale. Whenever Dignan
            came to visit me he would act like
            he and Swifty weren't that good of
            friends, but that was just to make
            me feel better. The whole rest of
            the school had turned against me.EXT. BOB'S HOUSE. DAYAnthony and Bob are sitting by the pool, drinking beers.
Future Man's swimming laps even though it's cold out.ANTHONYAt first they were going to charge
            me with manslaughter. That's partly
            why I was in custody so long. Sixty
            days.BOBSixty days?ANTHONYYeah. One minute you're studying
            Great Expectations and the next
            minute you're drawing the Holy Mary
            for some kid who tried to stab his
            girlfriend.BOBWhy were you drawing the Holy Mary?ANTHONYPrison tatoos. I got to be pretty
            good. It's not like drawing on paper.CUT TO:Future Man toweling off. He wears a Speedo swimsuit. He
walks over to Bob and Anthony. Anthony's just finishing a
drawing of a leaping jungle cat in black and red ink on
Bob's shoulder.

Pause. Future Man looks at Bob.FUTURE MANHow's that 700 bucks coming?BOBI'm working on it.FUTURE MANHard to find it sitting by the pool
            drinking beer and bullshitting.

He walks inside.ANTHONYI thought he didn't have to pay
            anything because of the technicality.BOBYeah, but he still has the
            aggravation. Three days sitting in
            a cell.ANTHONY(pause)
            Were you adopted, Bob?BOBWhy do you say that?ANTHONYWell, because you guys don't look
            alike.BOBNo. I wasn't adopted.

Long pause.ANTHONYWas Future Man adopted?BOBJesus Christ! No.INT. CAR. DAYDignan and APPLEJACK are sitting in, a '72 Monte Carlo by
the curb two houses down from Bob's. Applejack is a small
black man with white hair. It's hard to tell exactly how old
he is. Around sixty-five.DIGNANThere's a lot of valuable shit in
            there, Applejack. The silver and
            the china. The crystal. And the
            grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet
            that clock's worth ten grand.APPLEJACKWhy the fuck do we need to blow up
            the car? It doesn't make any
            goddamn sense.DIGNANJust settling an old score. You
            might say revenge.APPLEJACKThat sounds like a lot of bullshit
            that'll land us in jail.DIGNANWe might have to take that chance.
            Cause I feel pretty strongly about
            this.APPLEJACKIs that Buckethead?

Anthony is walking Hector down the driveway.DIGNANGet down.

Anthony does some stretching exercises in the driveway.APPLEJACKIs that him?DIGNANWait a second.

            Buckethead. That's what I figured.
            He's probably got his own room.
            Let's see where he's going.

Applejack puts the car in gear. They drive slowly.DIGNANDon't get too close.

Anthony looks back.DIGNANStop. He saw us.

Anthony keeps jogging with Hector.DIGNANWait. Did he see us?APPLEJACKWe're going too slow. It looks like
            we're following him.

Dignan looks down the alley. He looks at Anthony. Pause.ANTHONYWhen'd you get back?DIGNANAh. Couple days ago.

Pause.DIGNAN(under his breath)
            You want to shake hands.

Anthony puts his hand out. They shake. Pause. Anthony looks
down the alley.ANTHONYWho's in the car?DIGNANThat's Applejack. You want to meet
            him?ANTHONYSure.

They walk to the car.DIGNANThis is Applejack.

They shake.ANTHONYNice to meet you, Applejack.APPLEJACKYou're Anthony?ANTHONYYeah.APPLEJACKI hear you're a good thief.

Anthony shrugs and smiles. He nods.EXT. HAMBURGER PLACE. DAYA hamburger place with no other customers. Anthony, Dignan,
and Applejack are sitting at an outdoor table. It's cold and
their jackets are zipped up tight.APPLEJACKI'm just sitting at this bar
            drinking my drink when this fine
            chick walks by. She was a living
            doll. And the big motherfucker who
            came in with her sees me looking,
            when he walks by he steps on my
            foot. Doesn't say shit. Just takes
            a seat with his lady. Well, I
            holler out to him, If I was as big
            as you, ain't no way in the hell
            you'd of stepped on my foot like
            that. He just laughed. He says,
            Little man, take your foot and put
            it in your pocket. I said, No, how
            about I take my foot and I stick it
            up your ass? Man, we went to war
            right there. I hit him so hard I
            knocked his nuts in his watchpocket.
            But this motherfucker wouldn't go
            down. Then all the sudden, out of
            nowhere, Dignan came up behind him
            and smashed a bottle on his head.
            And that big old boy went down.
            That's how I met Dignan. Good cat
            to have on your side. He'll go to
            war with you. He don't give a fuck.

Applelack and Dignan slap hands.DIGNANApplejack would of got him anyway.
            This was just the quicker war.ANTHONYYou really hit a guy with a bottle?

Dignan takes a little notebook out of his pocket.DIGNANPretty much. He kind of fell into
            me. But wait a second.

Dignan opens the notebook on the table.DIGNANI want you to look at this.ANTHONYWhat is it?DIGNANIt's big, Anthony. Real big. It's

            call him Steve. That's where we get
            our information.ANTHONYWho's Mr. Henry?DIGNANYou'll meet him this afternoon.
            He's helping us set it up.APPLEJACKDid you ever hear of the S. Cooper

            Uh-uh.APPLEJACKS. Cooper Trust,in San Francisco?ANTHONYUh-uh.DIGNANMr. Henry pulled that job in 1965.
            It's famous. Applejack was the
            wheel man. Did you use this same
            car, Applejack?APPLEJACKHell, no. This is a '72. I was
            driving a '63 Pontiac.ANTHONYWhat exactly is this place? Freezers?DIGNANRight. Freezers. Imported foods.

at the front door of an old warehouse. Dignan knocks on the
door, then tries the bell. They all wait.ANTHONYWhat time did he say to be here?DIGNANRight now.

Dignan looks in the window. He tries the door. It's locked.APPLEJACKI can knock a man out with a six
            inch punch.ANTHONYWhat do you mean?APPLEJACKFeel this.

Anthony puts his hand up. Applejack does a short, hard jab.
Anthony shakes his hand out.ANTHONY(whistles)
            You could give somebody a concussion.DIGNANLet me feel that.

Dignan puts his hand up. Applejack nails it.DIGNAN(grabbing his hand)
            Ow. Shit.

A drop of water hits Dignan on the head. He looks up. More
water falls on him. He gets out of the way. Everyone looks
up. There's a man on the roof. He laughs, hysterically. They
stare up at him.MANHow's the weather down there?DIGNAN(pause)
            Mr. Henry?MANCome on in!DIGNANIt's locked.MANNo, it's not.

Dignan shrugs. He goes over to the door. Mr. Henry pours
some more water on him.

A minute later: a steel garage door opens and the man steps
outside. He is tall, about sixty years old with white hair
clipped short and a trim goatee. He wears black trousers,
black shoes, no shirt, and a string of animal teeth around
his neck. This is MR. HENRY. He puts a towel around Dignan's
shoulders and pats him on the back.MR. HENRYDignan. Good to see you. Good to
            see you Applejack.

looks back to Dignan.MR. HENRYThis is no good, bringing him here.
            What are you thinking? What the
            shit, man? Are you crazy?

Mr. Henry stares at Dignan. He looks to Anthony.MR. HENRYI'm pulling your leg. Abe Henry.

black man standing in the doorway. Rowboat wears a white
windbreaker.MR. HENRYThis is my business manager, Rowboat.ANTHONYNice to meet you.MR. HENRYThat's a sharp jacket.ANTHONYThanks.INT. WAREHOUSE. DAYThe second floor of the warehouse is one huge room painted

the room playing chess.ANTHONYIt's hard to get much spin with
            this kind of paddle.MR. HENRYIt's called a racquet, Anthony, and
            you're holding it wrong. That's
            ghetto play. Hold it like this.

Anthony changes his grip. Mr. Henry serves. The ball clicks
back and forth. They're both solid players. Anthony whips a
shot crosscourt and wins the point.MR. HENRYYou know, your form is for shit,
            but you've got a hell of a talent.ANTHONYThanks.

Mr. Henry serves. Anthony returns. Mr. Henry suddenly fires
a scorching shot down the line. Anthony watches it click
past him. He looks to Mr. Henry.ANTHONYNice shot.

Mr. Henry smiles. He looks to Dignan.MR. HENRYIs he in?DIGNANI don't know. Are you in, Anthony?

Rowboat. He looks to Mr. Henry. Then Dignan.ANTHONYYeah, I'm in.

apart. Some are shiny and perfect. Anthony and Dignan walk
among the cars and junk with Mr. Henry. They've each got
coffee in a styrofoam cup.MR. HENRYEvery once in a while some cat
            comes to me. He wants to know how I
            made it. How did I become a success?
            The first thing I tell them is:
            follow your instincts. Let your
            instincts guide you. The second
            thing I tell them is, for Christ's

            robbing.ANTHONYYou mean like techniques?MR. HENRY(nods)

Kumar nods. He looks at a plant growing by the window.
Silence.ANTHONYWhat is that? An orchid?

Kumar shakes his head. Sighs deeply. Long pause.

Kumar suddenly stands up and unbuttons his shirt. He throws
it on the bed. He undoes his trousers and takes them off.
Anthony looks at Dignan. Kumar takes off his socks, then his
shorts. He is naked. He walks over to his dresser and takes
out a small satchell. He looks around the room. Right at
Anthony. He walks quickly toward him. Anthony gets nervous.
Kumar grabs Anthony's shoulder and lifts him up a little. He
pulls a towel out from underneath Anthony. He puts his hand
on Dignan's shoulder as he walks to the door, into the hall.KUMARGood plan.

him around. Then he starts landing punches. One. Two. Then
Bob nails Dignan in the shoulder. They grab onto each other
and start fighting hard. They're about the same strength.

            about.

Clay smiles. Bob shakes his head. Mr. Henry stands up.
Everyone looks at him. He's got a cold but calm expression.MR. HENRYThe world needs dreamers, son.FUTURE MANWhat?MR. HENRYThe world needs dreamers. To
            relieve the pain of consciousness.

Future Man nods. Pause. Mr. Henry doesn't sit down.FUTURE MANWell, we'll see you later, Bob.MR. HENRYPleasure to meet you, John.FUTURE MAN(hesitantly)
            Nice to meet you.

Future Man and Clay walk away. Mr. Henry sits down.MR. HENRYI hope this doesn't offend you, Bob.
                   (looks closely at Bob)
            Your brother is a cocksucker.

Bob smiles. They all smile.BOBNo. That doesn't offend me.EXT. HINCKLEY COLD STORAGE. DAYDignan's hidden in some bushes, watching the Hinckley Cold
Storage building with binoculars. Anthony's crouched beside
him taking notes in a notebook.DIGNANOK. Man in blue jeans just left by
            southwest door. He is entering a
            white van. What time is it?ANTHONYEleven fifteen.DIGNANOK. Mark that down.ANTHONYI did.

Dignan keeps watching through the binoculars. He suddenly
looks back at Anthony.DIGNANGod. Isn't this great? Working on
            the job. Got a wheel man. Got a
            safecracker. Good friends with Mr.
            Henry.ANTHONYYeah. It's pretty good.DIGNANIt's like we've finally arrived.

Anthony nods. He's writing something.DIGNANWhat are you writing?

Anthony shows him a little flip cartoon of a guy pole
vaulting.INT/EXT. PLANNING SEQUENCE. DAYWe see the team assembled around a table. They're drinking
coffee and looking at pictures, charts, maps, diagrams,
tools. Dignan passes out some walkie talkies.

They test out some smoke cannisters on the roof. Dignan
throws one down. They all run for cover.

Applejack and Dignan drive fast through a slalom course in a
deserted parking lot.

We see Kumar working on a safe. He wears a stethoscope and
listens to the tumblers. He turns the dial. Dignan is timing
him with a stopwatch.

Kumar opens the safe. He looks at Dignan. Dignan nods with a
serious expression on his face.EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS. DAYAnthony and Mr. Henry are jogging along railroad tracks in
the warehouse district. Anthony wears a blue T-shirt and
shorts. Mr. Henry looks like a boxer in grey sweats with the
hood up and a crisp white towel wrapped around his neck and
tucked into his sweat top. He's wearing black Chuck Taylors.
They've both got smooth running styles, though every twenty
yards or so Mr. Henry rolls his shoulders and gives a quick
flurry of punches. An older woman rides a bicycle across the
tracks. She's not pretty, but she's got a strong face.
Pioneer stock.MR. HENRYLook at that woman. She's what?
            Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't
            let herself go. I appreciate an
            older woman who has a commitment to
            her body.ANTHONYSo do I.

They watch her ride down the street.MR. HENRYTell me something. What the hell
            kind of name is Dignan?ANTHONYI'm not really sure. I think it's
            Irish. Or maybe --MR. HENRYI guess what I'm trying to say is
            what the hell kind of person is
            this Dignan?ANTHONYWhat do you mean what kind of
            person? He's a good person.MR. HENRYSure, sure. He's a great person,
            and I'd call bullshit on anybody
            who said differently. But I wonder
            if the kid has the goods
                   (taps his temple)
            up here.ANTHONY(long pause)
            I don't think you're giving him
            enough credit. I know sometimes he
            doesn't think an idea through. He
            gets too excited. But --MR. HENRYAs far as I can tell he hasn't
            thought his life through. He'd be
            fine cutting my grass or parking my
            car. But business?
                   (looks at Anthony)
            You I can work with. You I could
            groom. Dignan's not going to make it.

Anthony stops running. Mr. Henry stops ahead of him and
looks back, jogging in place. Pause.ANTHONYYou're wrong about Dignan.

Mr. Henry stops jogging in place.ANTHONYAnd you're wrong if you think, I'd
            turn my back on a friend.MR. HENRYHold it.

Mr. Henry walks to Anthony and puts his hand on his shoulder.
Anthony knocks it off.MR. HENRYAnthony. I want.to say one thing to
            you.

Mr. Henry looks Anthony right in the eye.MR. HENRYCongratulations. You passed the test.ANTHONYWhat do you mean?MR. HENRYThe Abe Henry double-cross test.
            You just made a perfect score.

Anthony has to recover.ANTHONYThat was a test?MR. HENRYTake a deep breath.

Anthony takes a deep breath. Mr. Henry massages Anthony's
shoulders. He takes Anthony's head in his arms and does a
quick pull to one side: cracks his neck. Then the other side.MR. HENRYHow does that feel?ANTHONYIt feels good.

Anthony rubs his hands on his neck and moves his head around.ANTHONYDid Dignan take the test?MR. HENRY(pause)
            Yes, he did.ANTHONYHow'd he do?

They start jogging again.MR. HENRYWell, he agreed 100% that Bob
            should be dropped. And he also
            agreed you were a liability. But he
            felt his talent would make up for
            your weaknesses.ANTHONYThat sounds like Dignan.

They veer away from the tracks, picking up the pace, and
head into a field toward Mr. Henry's warehouse.EXT. ROOFTOP. NIGHTThey're having a party at Mr. Henry's warehouse. There are
tables and a BBQ on the roof, with white Christmas lights
strung up and music playing. Anthony, Dignan, Bob, Kumar,
and Mr. Henry are there. Plus a couple of young GIRLS,
eighteen or nineteen years old. Mr. Henry's got a name tag
that says, Hi, my name is Mr. Henry. Everyone's mingling on
the rooftop. Rowboat is at the grill. Applejack comes up the
stairs with a grocery bag under his arm.MR. HENRYWoah. There he is. Applejack! What
            it is.

Mr. Henry and Applejack shake hands.APPLEJACKIs my car OK out there?MR. HENRYI love it. He always wants to know
            if the car's OK. Get a hot dog.APPLEJACKI don't eat pork.MR. HENRYSuper K. Kumar. Come here.

Mr. Henry goes over to Kumar and throws his arm around him.APPLEJACKI don't know why the fuck we're
            having a party. The damn job's not
            over yet.DIGNANWell, this isn't really a party per
            se.APPLEJACKYou don't celebrate til it's over.DIGNANTrue.

Dignan's solemn for a minute. He takes a bite of a hot dog.APPLEJACKWhat the fuck are you doing?

Dignan hesitates. He takes the hot dog away from his mouth.
He's embarassed. Applejack shakes his head, disgusted. He
walks away.ROWBOATWhat was that all about?DIGNANRamedan.

Anthony and Mr. Henry are standing together in a doorway. Mr.
Henry's got a martini.MR. HENRYI'll tell you, Anthony. Times like
            this I get philosophical. What does
            it mean? What's it all about? Are
            you afraid to die?ANTHONYMe?MR. HENRYNo, that door over there.ANTHONYI don't want to die.MR. HENRYAre you afraid?ANTHONYYeah. I mean, I don't think about
            it all the time. But once in awhile
            I kind of go, Woah. Man.MR. HENRYExactly. Woah.ANTHONYDeath.MR. HENRYThe fear of death, The pain of
            consciousness.
                   (taking a sip)
            Did you mix this martini?ANTHONYNo. Bob did.MR. HENRYBob. Bob. That's a palindrome.
                   (laughs uproariously)
            I love palindromes.ANTHONYAre you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?MR. HENRY(looks right at him)
            Anthony, I'm petrified.

Bob is talking to the other girl.BOBIs that sugarless gum you're chewing?GIRL 2I'm not chewing gum.BOBWould you like a piece?GIRL 2(smiles brightly)
            Sure. Thanks.

Kumar and Applejack are sitting at a table.KUMARIf someone could copy my life story.
            If I had someone, man, to just
            write what I talk. I have so many

Mr. Henry looks in the door. He's got a glass of wine in one
hand and a bottle and empty glasses in the other.MR. HENRYJoin the party, fellas.DIGNANWe're just going over a few things.

Mr. Henry looks at the plans on the table. He sets down the
three glasses and pours some wine.MR. HENRYI'll tell you something, Dignan. It
            is possible to overplan. You don't
            want to turn the crew into robots.
            Right?

Dignan nods seriously.MR. HENRYYou got to have fun with it.
            There's no point if you're not
            having any fun. Would you like me
            to be there tomorrow?DIGNANYes.MR. HENRY(immediately)
            Why?DIGNANWell, I think --MR. HENRYNo, if I go out on this job, then
            it's just another score by Mr.
            Henry. And I don't see it like that.
            This is your job. Your creation. I
            want you to try this.

They all try the wine. Mr. Henry watches their reactions.ANTHONYThis is good.MR. HENRYI want to ask a favor, boys. One
            day, when I'm long gone and all but
            forgotten, make one last toast to
            Abe Henry. And remember me as a
            friend.

They drink.EXT. ROOFTOP. NIGHTBack on the roof. Bob and Dignan are sitting at a table with
one of the girls. Applejack is dancing with another. Kumar's
talking to Reudi. Anthony and Mr. Henry are standing at the
edge of the roof, looking out at the city. Mr. Henry's
smoking a joint.MR. HENRYWell, that's just it, Anthony. A
            lot of criminals have problems.
            Some of them are alcoholics. Some
            have drug problems. Others dome
            from broken homes. I see a real
            need for healing.

Mr. Henry passes the joint to Anthony. Anthony smokes it.MR. HENRYBut you're thieves. It's what you
            are.ANTHONYYeah.MR. HENRYIt's an esoteric journey.

Anthony passes the joint back to Mr. Henry.MR. HENRYWe're renegades from despair.ANTHONY(nods)

            Because I was like you once. And
            there was no one there to help me.

Mr. Henry exhales the smoke. He hands the joint to Anthony.
Anthony takes a hit. They stare out at the darkness.INT. BOB'S HOUSE. NIGHTAnthony and Dignan are sitting in the kitchen. Anthony's got
on a t-shirt and boxers. Dignan's wearing a bathrobe. All
the lights in the house are out except one in the kitchen.

            coladas.ANTHONY(nods)
            Hopefully this trip'll go a little
            smoother than the last one.

Dignan nods.ANTHONYOr I might end up with a broken nose.DIGNANDid that hurt?

Anthony shrugs. There's a long silence.DIGNANThis'll be a good trip.

Anthony nods. Pause. He smiles slightly.ANTHONYI'll try not to hold you back
            tomorrow.DIGNANI don't think you will.ANTHONYI don't want to be too much of a
            liability.DIGNANLook, you're going to do fine. It's
            OK to be scared.ANTHONY(laughs slightly,
                   shaking his head)
            I don't think I ever said this to
            you. But it meant a lot to me the
            way you were after that Swifty
            stuff happened.

Silence. Dignan's a little embarassed.ANTHONYHe was a nice guy.DIGNAN(shrugs)
            He was all right.

They both sit there for a minute. Quiet. Anthony sips his
milk.ANTHONYDo you like Inez?DIGNANAs a person?ANTHONYYeah. As a girl.DIGNANYes. I do.ANTHONYSo do I.

Bob comes into the kitchen in his bathrobe looking haggard
yet wired. Anthony and Dignan look at him. He goes to the
refrigerator. He takes out a chocolate cake and a carton of
milk. He pours himself a glass of milk. He goes over to the
table with the cake and sits down. He cuts himself a piece
of cake. He swallows two pills, one at a time, each with a
long drink of milk. The pills are big capsules and he
struggles a little when he swallows.ANTHONYYou OK, Bob?BOB(snaps)
            No, I'm having a heart attack. Of
            course, I'm OK. What's that supposed
            to mean?ANTHONY(pause)
            Nothing. I was just asking.DIGNANJesus, Bob.

Bob senses that's he's over-reacted. He backtracks.BOBNo, I know. I'm just saying. I feel
            fine. You want a piece of cake?ANTHONY(pause)
            Sure.

Bob starts to cut him a piece.DIGNANI'll take one of those, too, please.EXT. HINCKLEY COLD STORAGE. DAYAnthony is positioned behind some bushes, across from the
building. He's wearing a black parka. He looks through some
binoculars. Re pulls out his walkie talkie.ANTHONYBird Dog to Scarecrow. Bird Dog to

            We all set?DIGNAN (VO)Hang on a second.

Anthony waits a second.

We see Dignanr Applejack, and Kumar getting out of the car.DIGNAN(into walkie talkie)
            OK. Let's do it.

Dignan starts to move out. He remembers something. Says back
into his walkie talkie:DIGNANLet's get lucky, Bird Dog.

Dignan, Applejack, and Kumar start across the parking lot.
Dignan's got on a business suit. Applejack has on sunglasses.
Kumar is carrying a leather satchel.

They go in the side door and down a narrow passageway. They
get into the freight elevator and go up. Bob's voice comes
through on Dignan's walkie talkie.BOB (VO)Scarecrow?DIGNANYeah?

We see Bob: standing on the loading dock behind the building.
He's wearing an extremely heavy wool jumpsuit with a hood.BOBEverything OK?DIGNAN (VO)Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's
            it look back there?BOBIt looks pretty good. There's

We see Anthony: still in the bushes.ANTHONYUh-huh?DIGNAN (VO)Take your second position.ANTHONYOK. Roger.

Anthony gets up and starts out across the parking lot, hands
in his pockets, not too quickly.

Dignan, Kumar, and Applejack get off the elevator.DIGNANOK. Six minutes.

Applejack goes one way down the hall. Dignan and Kumar go
the other. They turn the corner. They go down a wide
passageway.KUMARWhere did he go?DIGNANWho? Applejack?KUMARWhy did he go that way?
                   (points back down hall)DIGNANHe's going to watch the back
            stairwell, remember?
                   (pause)
            Don't worry about it.

Dignan and Kumar come up to a door. Dignan slides a crowbar
out of his jacket. He snaps open the door. They go in. It's
a small office with a desk and a little safe in the corner.
Dignan clears everything off the desk with one quick sweep
of the arm. He puts down the briefcase and opens it up. It's
full of tools. Kumar unzips his satchel and takes out a roll
of tape. He immediately sets to work on the safe. Dignan
steps back out the door and closes it.DIGNAN(into walkie talkie)
            Bird dog? You in position?

We see Anthony on top of a fire escape, about four stories up.ANTHONYI'm in position, Scarecrow.DIGNAN (VO)Any activity?ANTHONYNot at all. The place is totally
            deserted.DIGNAN (VO)Good. It's supposed to be.ANTHONYI've got a great view up here. I

            Anthony? Who's in the elevator?

We see Anthony on the fire escape.ANTHONYI don't know.DIGNAN (VO)Check the fucking elevator. It's
            moving.

Anthony goes in a little door. Down a passageway. Through a
freezer. Into a corridor. Past the freight elevator, which
is open on this floor. Then around a corner to a smaller
elevator as it opens: Bob's inside.ANTHONYWhat are you doing?BOBMy walkie talkie's busted. 1 can't
            tell what's going on.ANTHONYLet me see it.

            Did you drop it?BOBNo.

Dignan's still standing in the hall as Anthony and Bob come
around the corner. Dignan yells at them down the hall.DIGNANWhat's happening? What's going on?ANTHONYIt was Bob. His walkie talkie's
            busted.BOBI couldn't hear anything.DIGNANWho's watching the door? What the
            fuck are you doing? Get back in

            Applejack! What's happening?APPLEJACK (VO)What?DIGNANBob! Get back in position!

For just a second we hear the sound of music playing.
Everyone freezes. FOUR GUYS, two of them in jumpsuits like
Bob's, step out into the corridor. They've got bags from
Jack in the Box. They're drinking drinks and shakes. One of
them is holding a jam box. They stop. Dignan pulls out his
gun.DIGNANDon't move! Get up against the wall!

Anthony and Bob pull out their guns and hold them on the
four guys.DIGNAN(into walkie talkie)
            They're back! Get down here!

running down the hall with his gun out.APPLEJACKWhere'd they come from?ANTHONYThe front stairs.APPLEJACK(to Bob)
            Where were you?BOBMy walkie talkie broke.

Applejack reaches in his pocket and pulls out a dark blue
nylon stocking. He pulls it over his head. Dignan, Anthony,
and Bob immediately do the same. Anthony's is red.

Dignan steps into the office with Kumar.DIGNANWhat's the story?KUMARCan't get it. It won't...
                   (make s gesture)DIGNANWhat can we do?

Kumar looks at his tools. Moves them around on the desk.DIGNANOK. Fuck it.

He goes back into the hall.DIGNANLet's go. Fuck it.

TWO GUYS with a cart stop at the end of the corridor.ANTHONYFreeze!DIGNANNobody move!ANTHONYGet against the wall!

Bob's gun goes off. Everybody looks at him. Dead silence.
Bob looks around like it must have been somebody else's gun
that went off.ANTHONYJesus, Bob.BOBI didn't do anything.

Applejack falls to his knees. He drops his gun.ANTHONYApplejack? Are you OK?

Applejack clutches his arm and rolls onto his side.DIGNAN(shouting)
            What's wrong with Applejack?BOBHe's having a heart attack or
            something.DIGNAN(screaming)
            Let's go!

Dignan throws down his smoke cannister. Bob and Anthony
automatically throw down theirs. Smoke instantly fills the
hall.

The hostages stand completely clear of the smoke. They watch
Anthony, Dignan, and Bob rush around blindly in the haze.DIGNANHelp me move him.ANTHONYCareful. Check his pulse.

Anthony holds all the guys at gunpoint. Dignan and Bob carry
Applejack down the hall, into the elevator.DIGNANIs he breathing?BOBI think so.

An alarm starts ringing.DIGNANJesus Christ.  What the fuck is that?BOBI didn't think there was an alarm.DIGNANTake him to the car, Bob.

Dignan runs back down the hall to Anthony.DIGNANWho tripped the alarm?ANTHONYIt's the fire alarm.  Somebody
            pulled the fire alarm.DIGNANWhere's Kumar?ANTHONY(looking around)

            lose him?GUY ON FLOORHe's in the freezer.DIGNANWhat?GUY ON FLOORHe went in there.ANTHONYWhat for?

The guy on the floor kind of shrugs.  Anthony crosses the
hall. He pulls open one of the big freezer doors. Kumar is
standing there with his bag and the briefcase.  You can see
his breath in the air.ANTHONYWhat are you doing?DIGNANLet's go. Come on.

They go down the hall to the freight elevator.  They start
down.ANTHONYWhat were you doing in there?

Kumar shakes his head and shrugs his shoulders.EXT. HINCKLEY COLD STORAGE. DAYThey go out the front door, across the parking lot. Kumar's
lagging behind.ANTHONYWait for Kumar.DIGNANCome on, Kumar.

They come up to the car. Anthony tries the door. It's locked.
Bob comes running around the side of the building.BOBThe elevator broke.DIGNANWhere's Applejack?BOBHe's stuck between two floors.ANTHONYYou're kidding.DIGNANApplejack's stuck in the elevator?BOBYeah.ANTHONYWho's got the car keys?

            Run. Run. Let's go.

Bob takes off at a sprint. Kumar follows him.ANTHONYJesus, Dignan.

Anthony pulls off the red stocking and throws it down. He
tries the other doors on the car.ANTHONYWhat the fuck happened to the the
            plan?

Dignan pulls off his stocking. Anthony starts walking fast
across the parking lot. Dignan stands still by the car.
Staring straight ahead.ANTHONYCome on.DIGNANI'll see you there.ANTHONYWhat?DIGNANI'll see you there.ANTHONYWhat are you talking about?DIGNANI'll get him.ANTHONYThere's not enough time.DIGNANYes, there is. Let's get organized.

Dignan starts toward the building. Anthony moves after him.ANTHONYDignan, it's too late.DIGNANI don't think so.

Dignan and Anthony look at each other for an instant. Dignan
turns and sprints back into the building.

Anthony stands alone in the parking lot.CUT TO:a bedroom with big French windows. No furniture.CUT TO:a wood-panelled study. Stripped bare.CUT TO:an elegant dining room. Cleaned out.EXT. BOB'S HOUSE. DAYA GUY in a moving company uniform carries a Louis XIV chair
out the front door of Bob's house, down the path to the
street. Two other MOVERS pass him on the way. They've got a
dolly.

The guy carries the chair into a huge moving van. It's full
of furniture and paintings.

Mr. Henry and Rowboat are standing in the street. Rowboat's
smoking a cigarette, writing on clipboard. Hector stands
behind them in the grass. Mr. Henry takes out two cigars. He
holds one out to Rowboat. Rowboat shakes his head. Mr. Henry
shrugs and lights one for himself.MR. HENRYYou know, Rowboat. People who smoke
            cigarettes die. People who smoke
            cigars just keep on going.

Rowboat nods, smoking. Mr. Henry looks at Hector. He points.MR. HENRYSit.

Hector sits. Mr. Henry smiles a broad smile. The movers go
buy with a beautiful Moroccan divan.EXT. HINCKLEY COLD STORAGE. DAYDignan comes out the front door pulling Applejack, semi-
conscious, to the car. Dignan loans Applejack against the
door. He checks Applejack's pockets for the keys. He looks
around on the ground.

He hears sirens in the distance. He looks across the parking
lot. Two squad cars screech in off the street.

Dignan takes off into the building.INT. HINCKLEY COLD STORAGE. DAYDignan sprints down the corridor. Races up the stairs. Runs
down hall after hall.

Two COPS appear out of the elevator.COPFreeze!

Dignan ducks into a stairwell. He runs down the stairs and
into another corridor. He can hear cops yelling from two
different directions. He crosses a catwalk. Cuts through an
office. Pulls open a door and goes into one of the freezer
rooms.

Cops come yelling down the hallway. Dignan runs through the
freezer room and tries the other door. It's stuck. Three
COPS come inside. Dignan instantly puts his hands up in the
air.COP #1Drop the fucking gun!COP #2Don't move!

Dignan drops the gun. The cops rush him. They nail him into
the wall. Get him in a headlock, pulling hard.COP #3You're caught, buddy.

They pull him into the hallway.COP #1Put your hands behind your back.DIGNANI'm not going to do anything.COP #3(squeezing his neck)
            Why'd you try to run, buddy? Don't
            you know what freeze means? Don't
            you speak fucking English?COP #1Take it easy.

They put him face down on the floor and cuff him.COP #1(to Dignan)
            Calm down.

They move him down the corridor. Dignan's nose is bleeding.
He looks terrified.

Applejack is sitting propped up against the wall. He's got
an oxygen mask on his face and a team of paramedics and cops
around him. Somebody's taking his blood pressure. Another
one's giving him an IV.CUT TO:Anthony running down a sidewalk. He drops his gun in a
trashcan without slowing down. He crosses a bridge and runs
into the the trees.BLACKOUT.FADE IN:EXT. COUNTY JAIL. DAYThere's snow in the air. The prison yard is wide with dry
grass and concrete. It's split up by chain link fences.
Guards sit in the towers.

Dignan's wearing an inmate jumpsuit. Anthony and Bob walk
with him across the yard. They've brought along two bags of
food from a hamburger place.DIGNANI said to the DA, That cop who hit
            me must of given me CRS disease.BOBWhat's that?DIGNANThat's just what the DA asked. CRS
            is a disease where you can't
            remember shit.

Dignan smiles.ANTHONYLike amnesia.DIGNANCan't remember shit. CRS.BOBOh.

Anthony kind of smiles.DIGNANTell Mr. Henry I said that.

Anthony nods. Silence. They walk past a bunch of guys
lifting weights on the other side of a fence.DIGNANSo is Mr. Henry going to come by
            and see me or anything?ANTHONY(pause)

Dignan nods. Pause.DIGNANWow.
                   (pause, looks at Bob)
            Sorry, Bob.

Bob shrugs, looking at the ground. Dignan looks to Anthony.DIGNANYou think Applejack knew?ANTHONY(shrugs)
            We haven't heard from Applejack
            since he got out of the hospital.
            His case got dismissed.

Dignan's stunned to hear this.DIGNANWhy?ANTHONYWe're not sure.BOBWe think Mr. Henry maybe --ANTHONYHis health isn't very good, you
            know. They take that into account.

Pause. Dignan nods.DIGNANNo. That's true.

Long pause.DIGNANDoes it float?ANTHONYWe're not sure yet. It's going to
            need some repairs.

Dignan nods.ANTHONYSo how is it in there?
                   (pointing at cell block)DIGNAN(shrugs)
            What can I say? It's jail. You
            don't sleep when you want to. You
            don't eat when you want to.BOBDo you have your own room?DIGNANWe don't have rooms, Bob. We have
            cells.BOBDo you have your own cell?DIGNANNo. I have a cellmate. His name's
            Carl.ANTHONYWhat's he in for?DIGNANHe stole a tractor.BOBDo they let you --DIGNANI don't really want to talk about
            it, Bob.

Long pause.

Anthony takes a sip from a milkshake. Dignan unwraps the
foil from a cheeseburger. He takes a bite.DIGNAN(with his mouth full
                   of food)
            This sure beats the shit out of the
            shit they crap out in this joint.

Anthony and Bob laugh. Dignan takes another huge bite.DIGNAN(smiling)
            I might have to have another one of
            these.CUT TO:Dignan in handcuffs behind a chain link fence. He's standing
in line with some other inmates.DIGNANThanks for coming.

Anthony nods. They stand there in silence. The line moves
forward a few steps. Anthony and Bob walk with Dignan on the
other side of the fence. The line stops. Pause.

Dignan leans toward the fence.DIGNANHey.

He motions for them to come closer to the fence. He whispers:DIGNANI think I may have found a way out
            of here.ANTHONY(pause)
            You're kidding.DIGNANNo. I'm not.ANTHONYHow?DIGNANShhh. Wait for my instructions.ANTHONYDignan, I --

The line starts moving. Anthony and Bob walk with Dignan on
the other side of the fence.DIGNANWhen we go through the next gate
            you'll have 30 seconds to take out
            the tower guard.ANTHONYWhat?DIGNANHave the car running at the north-
            west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --ANTHONYDignan, I --

            won't shoot civilians. Ready?BOBHold on --DIGNANHere we go.BOBWait a second --DIGNANNow!

Anthony and Bob look all around in a panic. They look to
Dignan.

Dignan shuffles along with the rest of the inmates. He looks
at Anthony and Bob. He smiles. He shrugs.DIGNANSo long.

Bob and Anthony slowly half-smile. They wave to Dignan as
the line of inmates turns away. Anthony looks to Bob. Bob
smiles.

The line of inmates stops about fifty feet away. Dignan
looks back. Anthony looks at him. Dignan's expression has
changed. He wasn't expecting them to see it. His eyes look
cold. Anthony puts his hand on the fence. Dignan turns and
the line of inmates disappears into the cell block.

Anthony stands there in silence.. He lets go of the fence.

He walks with Bob down the long path in the cold air.FADE OUT.
