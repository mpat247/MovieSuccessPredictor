           apartment in his business suit. He stumbles into --2 INT. NICK'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 2He drops his briefcase, strips off his jacket, loosens
           his tie and collapses onto the bed like a dead man. PAN
           OVER TO the alarm clock which reads "1:23 AM."MATCH CUT TO:3 INT. NICK'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING 3The alarm clock now reads "4:59 AM." It switches to
           "5:00" and a BLARING BUZZER goes off. Nick sits up in
           bed, shuts off the buzzer and painfully forces himself
           out of bed. He hurries out of the bedroom, passing the
           saddest, deadest houseplant in history.4 INT. NICK'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 4Nick opens his fridge to reveal a wasteland of moldy
           leftover containers and crusty condiments. The orange
           juice container he grabs is empty.NICKDamn.
                         
           He opens the freezer. It contains nothing but multiple
           boxes of "Jimmy Dean's Breakfast Bowl -- with Bacon!" He
           pops one in the microwave, then glances over at a framed
           photo of a slightly younger Nick kissing a smiling OLD
           WOMAN on the cheek. The frame reads: "I Y Grandma!"
           Nick sighs sadly.5 INT. NICK'S BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER 5Nick sits on the toilet eating his breakfast bowl with a
           fork. He takes some toilet paper from the roll and wipes
           his mouth with it.6 INT. NICK'S SHOWER - MOMENTS LATER 6Nick showers while simultaneously brushing his teeth and
           shaving. He loses track and brushes his face with the
           toothbrush.2.7 INT. NICK'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 7Nick hastily grabs work clothes from his messy drawers
           and closet. Clearly, no laundry has been done in a
           while.8 INT. NICK'S APARTMENT ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER 8Nick hurriedly buttons his shirt, tucks it in and begins
           tying his tie as the elevator reaches the lobby.9 INT. NICK'S CAR - SHORT TIME LATER 9As he drives to work, he dials a number and transfers it
           to speakerphone.JENNA (V.O.)(GROGGY)Hello?NICK(CHEERY)Hey, Jenna, it's Nick.JENNA (V.O.)It's five-thirty in the morning,
           Nick.NICKYeah, sorry. This is like the
           only time I have to make any
           personal calls. I just wanted to
           see if you felt like going out
           again because I had a great time
           with you on our last date.JENNA (V.O.)Our last date was two weeks ago.
           You haven't called me since.NICKI know and that's my bad. I've
           been swamped at work --JENNA (V.O.)Yeah, I remember. Work was all
           you talked about when we went out.NICKRight. Well, I'm up for a
           promotion which will give me a lot
           more free time --(CONTINUED)3.9 CONTINUED: 9JENNA (V.O.)Listen, I'm actually seeing
           someone. And even if I weren't,
           the last thing I need is some
           career-obsessed guy complaining
           about work all the time. See you
           around, Nick.
                         
           She hangs up.10 EXT. COMMTRONIX INDUSTRIES - SHORT TIME LATER 10A soulless four-story building in a drab office park.
           Nick exits his car and runs full-speed to the entrance.11 INT. COMMTRONIX INDUSTRIES LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTION 11Nick bursts through the doors and looks at his watch. It
           reads "6:02." He looks up at a security camera with a
           flashing red light, indicating he is on tape.NICKFuck!DISSOLVE TO:12 INT. NICK'S CUBICLE - LATER 12Nick sits at his desk inputting information from a large
           PILE of documents into a spreadsheet on his computer.
           The clock on his computer turns to "8:00 AM."HARKEN (O.S.)Nick.
                         
           Nick jumps, startled. He turns to see his boss, DAVE
           HARKEN, 40's, standing behind him.NICKYes?HARKENSee you in my office?4.13 INT. HARKEN'S OFFICE - CLOSE ON A VIDEOTAPE REPLAY - 13MOMENTS LATERof the lobby security camera footage on a television.
           The time code at the bottom of the screen reads "6:02."
           We see Nick looking up at the camera and silently
           mouthing the word "Fuck!" The image freezes and we PULL
           BACK to see Harken holding the remote. Nick stands
           across from him.HARKENHere's my concern, Nick. You're a
           punctual guy. You understand the
           importance of getting to work on
           time. So that leaves me to wonder
           if there isn't something wrong
           with the internal clock in our
           security system. What do you
           think?NICKI don't know, Mr. Harken. I might
           have been a minute late.HARKENTwo minutes according to this. So
           either you're a liar -- which I
           know you're not -- or our system
           is off by a full minute. And if
           that's the case, I have no choice
           but to dismiss Thomas, our
           longtime security coordinator.NICKOkay, I might have been two
           minutes late.
                         
           There's an uncomfortable beat. Then --HARKENSo you did lie.NICKNo, I --
                         
           Harken picks up the phone.NICKWho are you calling?HARKENThomas. I'm letting him go.(CONTINUED)5.13 CONTINUED: 13NICKWait! Okay, I guess I lied. But
           I didn't mean to --HARKEN(hangs up phone)
           Trust is everything in this
           office, my friend. I know you've
           been working your tail off for
           that promotion, but if I can't
           trust you, how can I make you
           Senior VP of Sales?NICKI understand. You can trust me.HARKENNow you sound like my wife.
                         
           He glances at a framed photo on his desk.14 INSERT - PHOTO 14of the hot, bikini-clad MRS. HARKEN, 30's, standing on a

           out of your league. No offense.NICKNone taken.HARKENHmm.
                         
           Harken has crossed to a credenza with several bottles of
           booze, two glasses and an ice bucket. He begins to fill
           a glass with ice and Scotch.HARKENWould you like one?NICKIt's 8:15.HARKENYou think there's something wrong
           with a man enjoying a drink in the
           morning?NICK(QUICKLY)No, no. It's fine. I'd love a
           drink.
                         
           Harken hands him the drink he just poured.NICKThank you.HARKENMy pleasure.
                         
           Harken returns to his chair and sits.NICKAren't you having one?HARKENIt's 8:15, Nick. I'm not an
           alcoholic.NICKOh. Well, I only took it because
           I thought you were having one.HARKENYou took a drink because you
           thought I was going to have one?(MORE)(CONTINUED)7.15 CONTINUED: (2) 15HARKEN (CONT'D)That doesn't exactly sound like
           something a Senior VP would do.NICKWell, I --HARKENWhat if you thought I was going to
           dip my balls in honey and shaved
           coconut? Would you do that too?NICK(LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)Of course not.HARKENOf course not. Anyway, we've
           moved up the date of the AGM so
           you're gonna need to complete your
           due diligence by Monday. You'll
           probably need to be here all
           weekend.NICK(SIGHS)Okay.HARKENHey, you want a promotion, you've
           gotta earn it. Life's a marathon
           and you can't win a marathon
           without putting a few Band-Aids on
           your nipples.NICK(huh?)

           can't really pour it back into the
           bottle.

           They kiss. Dale exits the car.20 EXT. DENTAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION 20Stacy drives off. Dale steels himself for what lies
           ahead, then goes inside.21 INT. DENTAL OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 21Dale enters the waiting room, passing a few PATIENTS. He
           grabs a mask and goggles from a supply room, then headsINTO --9.22 INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 22Dale finds his boss, DR. JULIA HARRIS, 30's, sexy but
           with something a little off, hovering over a patient, MR.
           ANDERTON, 50's. Dale seems visibly uneasy.JULIAAll right, Mr. Anderton, I'm going
           to give you the nitrous now and
           your root canal will be over
           before you know it.(TO DALE)Dale? Please.
                         
           Dale turns the valve on the tank and soon Mr. Anderton's
           eyes roll back in his head. Julia shuts the door, picks
           up a drill and begins boring into the patient's molar.JULIA(loudly, over theDRILL)How are you today, Dale?DALEI'm fine. Thanks.JULIAYou get a haircut?DALEUh-huh.JULIALooks good.DALEThank you.JULIAYou ever watch that show, `Gossip

           hard to Penn Badgely, I broke a
           nail.
                         
           Dale sighs and looks down at the unconscious Mr.
           Anderton. This obviously isn't the first time Julia has
           spoken this way.JULIAI'd let that kid put it in my ass.
           Bet he's packing a plus-size
           sausage under those True
           Religions.

           fool around.

           breast.JULIA(FEIGNING SHOCK)Mr. Anderton! Bad!

           some water in the patient's mouth, then casually sprays
           down Dale's crotch with it.DALEHey!JULIASorry, I'm a squirter.
           (studying his groin)
           I think I can just make out our

           Nick and Dale, Kurt seems content in his workplace. A
           reasonably cute, but by no means drop-dead gorgeous, UPS
           GIRL approaches his desk with a package.UPS GIRLExcuse me? Can you sign for this,
           please?KURT(TAKING IT)Sure.(LOOKING UP)Whoa, whoa. Hold on. What is

           looking to be a UPS girl. What
           are you, a model? An actress?

           She heads off. Kurt opens his DATEBOOK and scribbles
           "UPS Girl" in the Tuesday slot. We see every night of
           the week is filled with appointments with other women:
           "Barnes & Noble girl," "Lauren? Laura?," "Blonde Chick"
           and so on.JACK (O.S.)Busy week?

           year-to-year.JACKIt's this damn recession. What
           about cost-cutting measures?KURTWell, I know you don't want to cutSTAFF --JACKNo way. These people have worked
           their asses off for me. There's
           no reason they should suffer.
                         
           Kurt looks at his boss with admiration. There's a lot of
           love between these two.KURTThere's also the issue of our
           hazardous waste disposal. We're
           paying a lot right now and the
           Bolivians have come back with a
           very good offer.JACKYou know why it's good? Because
           they'll dump our chemicals in
           rivers, pollute water supplies and
           hurt people. I've spent my life

           PELLIT, late-20s, weasely-looking, sniffing a bit too
           much and rubbing his nose repeatedly. There's something
           unnaturally energetic about him.PELLITWhat the fuck?! A guy can't get
           any privacy in this place!JACKIt's all yours, Margie.

           my ass because I'm your son. I
           don't see you screaming at --(RE: KURT)-- dickskin here.JACK(PATIENTLY)That's because Kurt does his work
           and does it well. You could take
           a lesson from him.PELLIT(SNORTS)The only thing I'd take a lesson
           from him on is being gay. And I

           difficulty, Kurt slides open the window.KURTHere we go.
                         
           The three of them manage to wriggle through the window.
           It's not graceful: Dale's foot gets caught on the sill,
           causing him to tumble on top of Nick and Kurt. At last,
           all three are inside.63.61 INT. PELLIT'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 61KURTDale, keep an eye out. Let us

           They take in Pellit's living room. There's a leather
           sofa, a 60-inch plasma and enormous speakers. On the
           wall are framed Ed Hardy posters depicting dragons and
           half-naked girls.KURTWow. This guy's a bigger
           douchebag than me.NICKOkay, let's split up. Look for
           any intel we can use on him.KURTWhat kind of intel?NICKI don't know. I guess we'll know
           it when we see it.
                         
           Kurt heads upstairs while Dale and Nick look around the
           living room.DALEHey, Nick? Does this count as
           intel?
                         
           Nick looks over to see Dale holding in his sleeve-covered
           hands an open wooden box filled with white powder.NICKHoly shit, that's a lot of blow.DALEGod, this must be worth, like, ten
           thousand -- oh shit!(CONTINUED)64.61 CONTINUED: 61Suddenly, the box slips out of Dale's hands. It hits the
           floor, sending a cascade of cocaine all over the rug.NICKWhat the fuck?!!DALESorry, my sleeves were slippery!NICKWe've got to get that back in the
           box.DALEI've got it.
                         
           He kneels and begins trying to scoop up the coke in his
           hands. It's an impossible task.62 INT. PELLIT'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME 62Kurt looks around the room. He doesn't see anything
           useful so he heads into --63 INT. PELLIT'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 63He flips on the light. His eyes land on Pellit's

           shirt.NICKLook out. Let me try this.
                         
           Struggling with his hands in his T-shirt, Nick vacuums up
           the cocaine from the rug. When he's finished, he pops
           open the vacuum's waste receptacle and dumps the contents
           back in the wooden box.65 CLOSE ON THE BOX 65Which is now filled not only with cocaine, but bits of
           hair, dust bunnies, food and other crap.65.66 BACK TO SCENE 66DALEI guess we should've emptied the
           Dustbuster before we used it.NICKYou think?67 INT. PELLIT'S BATHROOM - SAME TIME 67Just BELOW FRAME, Kurt removes Pellit's toothbrush from
           his ass and returns it to its holder, careful to keep his
           hands covered with his sleeves.

           camouflaged by shrubs. They peek inside.NICK(WHISPERING)Looks like the coast is clear.
                         
           Kurt tries the windows. They're locked.KURTDamn. Guess we'll have to break

           Planters peanuts.88 INT. HARKEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 88Harken looks around suspiciously, then goes to Mrs.
           Harken's closet. He opens it and begins looking through
           her clothing. He sniffs one of her dresses and his eyes
           narrow. He sniffs himself, then compares it to the smell
           of the dress. Unsatisfied, he continues searching around
           the room for any incriminating evidence. Suddenly, his
           foot comes in contact with something on the floor. He
           reaches down and picks up...PELLIT'S BLACKBERRY.He turns it on and scrolls down the contacts list to
           "HOME" which shows Bobby Pellit's name and address.

           shampoo and the lid from the peanuts, he notices that MR.
           PEANUT is STARING right at him. Despite his jaunty top
           hat and little monocle, there is something almost
           accusing in his look. Dale stares back at Mr. Peanut as
           we see his resolve soften.92 INT. NICK'S CAR - SAME TIME 92Nick watches as Pellit finally gets into bed and turns

           still behind them. As his car reaches an intersection,
           Kurt swerves at the last second and takes a hard left.
           Harken overshoots the turn.ON STAR REP (V.O.)Oh dear. I will alert the local
           police authorities and direct them
           to your location.NICKNo, wait! Don't call the police!

           Suddenly, Kurt's engine dies and the car comes to a
           gradual stop.NICKWhy are you slowing down?!KURTI'm not! The engine died!ON STAR REP (V.O.)I have remotely disabled your
           engine.KURTWhy would you do that, Gregory?!ON STAR REP (V.O.)It's a standard On Star safety

           Gregory!
                         
           There's a sound of screeching tires and Harken's Porsche
           ZOOMS up behind them.NICKHe's not stopping!KURTOh, shit!134 EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION 134Harken's car PLOWS into the rear of Kurt's, forcing it
           into the back of a parked car. Even if the engine was
           working, there'd be nowhere to go now.
                         
           Dazed from the impact, the guys look back to see Harken
           slowly approaching on foot, holding a gun in his hand.(CONTINUED)112.134 CONTINUED: 134DALEShit, shit, shit...
                         
           Harken taps on Kurt's window with the barrel of the gun.
           Kurt lowers the window.KURTI'm guessing you don't want toEXCHANGE INSURANCEinformation -- ?HARKENOut of the car. All of you.
                         
           The three guys nervously exit the car and face Harken who
           points the gun at them.NICKLook, Mr. Harken --HARKENShut the fuck up! I've got six
           bullets in here. So if I want to,
           I can shoot each of you twice,
           just like I did that bastard,
           Pellit. But if I do that, I'll
           have to spend the rest of my life
           running from the law or rotting in
           jail.
                         
           Police sirens approaching.DALE(NEAR TEARS)So, you're not gonna shoot us?HARKENNo. I have a better idea.
                         
           Harken turns the gun toward his own thigh and FIRES.HARKENUnnnnhhhh!NICKWhat the -- ?!
                         
           As his leg bleeds, Harken wipes the gun off with his
           shirt, then suddenly tosses it to Dale.HARKENCatch.
                         
           Startled, Dale catches the pistol with shaking hands.(CONTINUED)113.134 CONTINUED: (2) 134HARKEN(THROUGH GRITTEDTEETH)Now I can tell the cops that when
           I discovered you three killed
           Pellit, you tried to kill me to
           shut me up.KURTThat's crazy!
                         
           Down the street, two squad cars turn the corner and speed
           toward them. Dale looks down at the gun in his hand and
           drops it.HARKENIs it? Because I don't see a
           shred of evidence proving that I
           killed Pellit. It's like I've
           always told you, Nick. Life is a
           marathon and you can't win a
           marathon without putting a few
           Band-Aids on your nipples.
                         
           Nick deflates. The three guys realize Harken's won.
           Then, from the car's open window they hear:ON STAR REP (V.O.)Did I mention that this
           conversation is being recorded?
                         
           Kurt, Nick and Dale exchange a look of shock and relief.HARKENWho said that?KURT(GRINNING)That's Gregory, our On Star rep.ON STAR REP (V.O.)(PROUDLY)My name is Atmanand!
                         
           Harken's face falls. He looks around nervously as the
           police cars come to a halt.HARKENYou can't -- this isn't --
                         
           And with that, Harken BOLTS AWAY as fast as his injured
           leg will take him. It's not very fast. The guys watch
           him for a beat as they share a joyful, exhausted moment
           together.(CONTINUED)114.134 CONTINUED: (3) 134NICKI think this is gonna work out

           This is for you, Gam Gam.
                         
           Nick sprints off after his hobbling boss and in SLOW
           MOTION, violently TACKLES Harken to the pavement. Harken
           goes down hard, his face SLAMMING against the asphalt.
                         
           As the COPS hurry toward them, Nick kneels on the back of
           Harken's neck, pinning him.HARKENGet the fuck off me!
                         
           Kurt steps up and kneels beside the battered figure.KURT(GENTLY)Hey, Harken, one last thing?HARKEN(BARKING)What?!KURTYour wife gives great head.

           He smiles when he sees Margie, the pregnant employee, now
           running the company. He heads over.137 INT. MARGIE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 137Kurt knocks on the doorframe and enters.MARGIEOh, hey, Kurt. Come in.KURTThanks, Margie. I just wanted to

           Kurt pats her belly. Margie now looks genuinely pissed
           off.(CONTINUED)116.137 CONTINUED: 137MARGIEI'm aware that I have a weight

           He falls silent under Margie's death stare.MARGIE(COLDLY)Kurt, I know you were a favorite

           overlook your inappropriate
           behavior with female clients and
           service people. But you should be
           aware, I'm not Jack. And I have

           Kurt opens his mouth to say something but thinks better
           of it. He stands up and slumps out. Life as he knew it
           at Pellit Chemicals is clearly over.138 INT. DENTAL EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY 138Julia enters to find Dale waiting for her. A PATIENT
