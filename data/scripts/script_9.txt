	Production Draft
	June 27, 1994FADE IN:INT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT TERMINAL - BAYCLOSE ON A FACE.  A nine year old boy, YOUNG COLE, his eyes wide
	with wonder. watching something intently.  We HEAR the sounds of
	the P.A. SYSTEM droning Flight Information mingled with the
	sounds of urgent SHOUTS, running FEET, EXCLAMATIONS.

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  twenty yards away, a BLONDE MAN is sprawled on
	the floor, blood oozing from his gaudy Hawaiian shirt.

	A BRUNETTE in a tight dress, her face obscured from YOUNG COLE'S
	view, rushes to the injured man, kneels beside him, ministering
	to his wound.

	ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, flanked by his PARENTS, their faces out of
	view, as they steer him away.

				FATHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Come on, Son --this is no place for us.

	YOUNG COLE resists momentarily, mesmerized by the drama.

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  intermittently visible through a confusion of
	FIGURES rushing through the foreground, the BLONDE MAN reaching
	up and touching the cheek of the kneeling BRUNETTE in a gesture
	of enormous tenderness, a gesture of farewell, while the P.A.
	SYSTEM continues its monotonous monotone...P.A. SYSTEMFlight 784 for San Francisco is now
		ready for boarding at inmate number
		66578, Greely.INT.  PRISON DORMITORY/FUTURE - ETERNAL NIGHTPRISON P.A. SYSTEM--number 5429, Garcia -- number 87645, Cole...

	COLE, late thirties, dark hair, comes awake in a bunk cage, one
	of many stacked four high along both sides of a long dim
	corridor.  He blinks in the near dark, shaken, disoriented.

	Then, as he "recovers" from his very vivid dream, WE GET OURFIRST LOOK AT HIS ENVIRONMENT...A WINDOWLESS UNDERGROUND WORLD OFETERNAL NIGHT SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE...AN ALMOST COLORLESS"REALITY" OF BLURRED EDGES AND ECHOEY SOUNDS, MUCH MORE"DREAMLIKE" THAN HIS DREAM.Flashlights glare. In the half-light, COLE sees spooky figures,
	GUARDS, moving among the locked bunk/cages.

	COLE turns and whispers to the occupant of the next cage, JOSE...COLESsssst!  Jose, what's going on?

	JOSE's face is almost lost in shadow.  What there is of it is
	youthful.  He's just a scared Puerto Rican kid!JOSE"Volunteers" again.

	JOSE immediately rolls over and feigns sleep as SCARFACE, a
	menacing guard with a jagged scar running down his cheek, looms
	close to COLE's cage and unlocks it.SCARFACE"Volunteer duty".

    The PRISONERS in the other cages watch silently with narrowed eyes.COLEI didn't volunteer.SCARFACEYou causing trouble again?COLE(controls his temper)
		No trouble.INT.  EQUIPMENT ROOM - ETERNAL NIGHTCOLE's alone, struggling to get into what looks like a space suit
	in a room where suits hang like ghosts with blank eyes.TITLES BEGIN SUPERED OVER THE SCENECOLE has the torso of the suit on now and is trying to close it.

				OFFSCREEN VOICE (o.s.)
		All openings must be closed.

	COLE looks for the source of the voice, a tiny grate in the wall.

				OFFSCREEN VOICE (o.s.)
		If the integrity of the suit is compromised
		in any way, if the fabric is torn or a zipper
		not closed, readmittance will be denied.INT.  SEALED CHAMBER - MINUTES LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)COLE, wearing the "space suit" and a helmet with a plastic visor,
	steps into a tiny chamber, a kind of air lock.  The heavy door
	clangs shut behind him.  He's alone.  COLE'S breath comes quicker
	now as he sucks oxygen from the air tanks on his back.

	On the opposite wall is another door with a huge wheel lock.
	COLE turns the heavy wheel, opens the door, steps through ItINT.  ELEVATOR - SECONDS LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)COLE'S in an ascending elevator that groans and creaks.  He looks
	down at a crudely drawn map he holds in his gloved hand.

	The map shows a series of tunnels and ladders.INT.  SEWER PIPE - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)COLE pans a flashlight, probing the filthy sewer he's wading through

	RATS flee the blade of light, scurry across islands of rusting junk.

	The flashlight beam settles on a ladder mounted in the wall.

	Reaching the rusted ladder, COLE starts to climb awkwardly.EXT.  CITY STREET/FUTURE - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)A SCRAPING NOISE as a heavy man-hole cover is pushed up and moved
	aside.  COLE'S helmeted head emerges from below.

	COLE'S POV THROUGH HIS PLASTIC-VISORED HELMET:  a city in
	moonlight!  A surreal image of abandoned buildings.  No people
	anywhere.  The only sounds are the WIND and COLE'S BREATHING.EXT.  ANOTHER CITY STREET - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)COLE'S light reveals abandoned vine-covered automobiles.Moving to the nearest car, COLE searches in the vines for
	something.  Finds it.  An insect.

	COLE takes the bug in his gloved hand.  As he clumsily inserts it
	into a collection tube, something makes him turn.

	There's something across the street in the dark.  Something alive.

	COLE points his flashlight and reveals...a BEAR!  Startled by the
	light, the animal blinks, then stands on its rear legs and ROARS.

	ANGLE ON COLE, staring wide-eyed.Then, the BEAR sinks down onto all fours and, trying to avoid the
	flashlight, it pads quickly down the street.INT.  SUBTERRANEAN PARKING GARAGE - NIGHTUsing the flashlight to see, COLE reaches down to the cracked
	floor and gets another specimen.  DOGSHIT!

	The only sound is COLE'S labored BREATHING.

	Then, a different SOUND.  GRRRR!  A dog.  More GRRRRS.  More
	dogs.  Then, a YIP.  Then, VICIOUS GROWLS.  It's a DOGFIGHT!EXT.  STREET - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)A giant OWL, perched on an overhead traffic light, raises its wings
	and lifts off...rising higher and higher into the brightening sky.

	Below, on the street, COLE trudges along, passing deserted
	buildings, windows broken, rusted signs dangling.INT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)COLE'S light reveals a spider web just inside the store.  A large
	SPIDER tries to hide from the light.

	COLE reaches carefully into the web and plucks the spider and
	puts it into one of his specimen tubes.

	Then, he shines his light all around the once elegant store.  There's
	nothing but aisle after aisle of moldering consumer goods.EXT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - DAWNAs COLE comes out of the store, the first rays of the sun hit the
	building.  COLE stops, squints into the light through his visor.

	COLE'S POV:  spray-painted on the wall a long time ago is a stenciled
	logo of twelve monkeys holding hands in a circle.  Over it is
	written, "WE DID IT!"

	COLE looks up.

	COLE'S POV:  high up on a building across the street, a LION
	patrols a ledge, pauses, looks out majestically over his world.TTTLES ENDINT.  FIRST UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHTROARING WATER, powerful torrents gushing from nozzles in the
	wall, pummel the still-suited COLE.INT.  SECOND UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHTStark naked and shivering, COLE is being scrubbed with brushes on
	long poles (like the ones used to wash cars) wielded by two HULKING
	FIGURES in bulky decontamination suits, their personas lost in their
	windowed masks.  It's a grim scene in a grim cement room with damp,
	dripping walls.  From an unseen source comes an AMPLIFIED VOICE,

				AMPLIFIED VOICE (o.s.)
		Raise your arms above your head.

	COLE lifts his arms and the FIGURES start scrubbing his armpits.INT.  TINY CHAMBER - SHORTLY (ETERNAL NIGHT)Still naked, COLE is seated on a stool while a MASKED TECHNICIAN
	in a less elaborate, less bulky decontamination outfit draws
	blood from COLE'S arm with an old-fashioned hypodermic needle.

	COLE glances toward a single, nearly opaque "window" of thick
	plastic in the rusty iron wall.  VAGUE FIGURES seem to lurk
	behind the translucent aperture, studying him.

	The TECHNICIAN slips the blood sample through a slot in the wall.INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE/FUTURE WORLD - ETERNAL NIGHTUshered in by two guards, TINY and SCARFACE, COLE looks around.

	COLE'S POV:  wails hidden by old headlines, articles, maps, charts...
	a blackboard covered with elaborate, sophisticated formulae...surfaces
	heaped with cracked monitors, gerry-rigged computers held together with
	string, lasers lost in tangles of cable, ancient tube amplifiers, a
	dilapidated cardboard reconstruction of a city, stacks of moldering
	books and tattered computer printouts...and, seated at a long conference
	table, staring at COLE, six SCIENTISTS:  an ASTROPHYSICIST, ENGINEER,
	BOTANIST, MICROBIOLOGIST, ZOOLOGIST, and a GEOLOGIST.  They represent
	a "modern" science where brilliant new ideas interface with crude,
	outdated, patched-together technologies.TINYJames Cole.  Cleared from quarantine.MICROBIOLOGISTThank you.  You two wait outside.SCARFACEHe's got a history, Doctor.  Violence.

	COLE'S eyes return to the walls.

	Headlines:  "CLOCK TICKING!  NO CURE YET!"SCARFACEAnti-social six -- doing 25 to life.ENGINEERI don't think he's going to hurt us.  You're
		not going to hurt us, are you Mr. Cole?

	COLE'S head turns quickly to the ENGINEER.COLENo, sir.

	The GUARDS exchange a look, shrug, exit, closing the door.MICROBIOLOGISTWhy don't you sit down, Mr. Cole.

	COLE goes to the empty chair at the conference table, sits down.ASTROPHYSICISTWe want you to tell us about last
		night.COLEI went to the surface and I collected
		specimens like I was told.

	The SCIENTISTS don't say anything.  They just study him carefully.COLE(worried)
		I mashed the spider, didn't I?MICROBIOLOGISTWe'll get to the spider later, Mr.
		Cole.  Right now, we want to know
		everything that you saw.INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)COLE, starting to look very tired now, stands at the blackboard
	sketching a detailed map of exactly where he was last night.ASTPOPHYSICISTWhere you collected sample #4, what
		street was that?COLEUh...BOTANISTIt's important to observe everything.COLEI think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.

	As the SCIENTISTS start to whisper animatedly among themselves,
	COLE'S eyes drift across the newspaper clippings taped to the
	wall.  One headline screams, "VIRUS MUTATING!"  Another features
	a photo of an OLD MAN (DR. MASON, who we'll see again later on)
	and the words, SCIENTIST SAYS, "IT'S TOO LATE FOR CURE".

				ASTROPHYSICIST'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Close your eyes, Cole.

	Startled, COLE closes his eyes obediently.

	BLACKNESS.  Like COLE, WE SEE NOTHING.  But we HEAR their VOICES.

				ENGINEER'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Tell us in detail what you've seen in
		this room.

				COLE'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Uh, in this room?  Uh...

				MICROBIOLOGIST'S VOICE (o.s.)
		How many of us are there?

				COLE'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Six...seven, if you count me.

				ASTROPHYSICIST'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Tell us about the pictures on the wall...

				COLE'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Uh, you mean the newspapers?

				A MONTAGE OF OVERLAPPING VOICES (o.s.)
		Tell us about the newspapers.  Can you
		hear my voice?  What do I look like?
		What does he look like, the man who
		just spoke?  How old were you when you
		left the surface?

	The VOICES blur into a cacophony and FADE INTO the droning P.A.
	SYSTEM at the airport.INT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAYTHE DREAM AGAIN!  But at an earlier moment.  YOUNG COLE, flanked
	by his PARENTS, whose faces are out of view, is watching a PLANE
	land through one of the big glass windows that lines the concourse
	leading to the departure gates.

				P.A. SYSTEM (o.s.)
		Flight 784 now boarding at gate...

	Suddenly, a SHOUT, followed by raised VOICES, interrupts the
	monotonous airport routine.  As YOUNG COLE and his PARENTS turn
	to see what's going on, a man we'll call MR. PONYTAIL, his face
	averted, hurries past them, bumping YOUNG COLE with a Chicago
	Hulls Sports Duffle Bag.MR. PONYTAILWATCH IT!YOUNG COLE sees little more than the gaudy pants, the duffle, and
	the man's ponytail flopping as he rushes towards the gates.

	Just then, a WOMAN'S VOICE cries out, "NOOOOOOOOO!"

	YOUNG COLE turns back toward the Security Check Point just as
	TRAVELERS scatter madly, some diving to the floor, others
	running.  A TERRIFIED TRAVELER, hitting the floor close by, looks
	up at YOUNG COLE with panicky eyes, and asks....TERRIFIED TRAVELERJust exactly why did you volunteer?INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE/FUTURE WORLD - (ETERNAL NIGHT)COLE comes abruptly awake.  Seated now, he's facing the SCIENTISTS.ASTROPHYSICISTWake up, Cole.COLEUh, I didn't hear the...MICROBIOLOGIST(tapping a pencil on the table)
		I asked you, why did you volunteer?COLEWell, the guard woke me up.  He told me
		I volunteered.

	The SCIENTISTS react, whispering urgently among themselves.

	COLE starts to nod off again, then comes awake with a start as
	the ENGINEER speaks to him.ENGINEERWe appreciate you volunteering.  You're
		a very good observer, Cole.COLEUh, thank you.ENGINEERYou'll get a reduction in sentence.

	COLE keeps his face impassive.ASTROPHYSICISTTo be determined by the proper authorities.ENGINEERYou don't want to jeopardize that reduction,
		do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?COLENo, sir!ASTROPHYSICISTWe have a very advanced program, something
		very different, requires very skilled people.MICROBIOLOGISTAn opportunity to reduce your sentence
		considerably...ZOOLOGISTAnd possibly play an important role in
		returning the human race to the surface
		of the earth.ENGINEERWe want tough minded people.  Strong
		mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes
		with "unstable" types.ASTROPHYSICISTFor a man in your position...an opportunity.BOTANISTNot to volunteer could be a real mistake.MICROBIOLOGIST(tapping his pencil again)
		Definitely a mistake!

	COLE gives away nothing.  He's in a box here.  He has no choices.
	He stares at the tapping pencil.INT.  ART GALLERY - NIGHTA strikingly "real" world of bright colors.  Extravagant paintings
	adorn the walls.  A POET, tiny and ruddy faced, squints over his
	glasses as he reads in a booming voice to an AUDIENCE of thirty
	seated on folding chairs.POETStill among the myriad microwaves, the
		infra-red messages, the gigabytes of ones
		and zeroes, we find words, infinitesimally
		small, byte-sized now, tinier even than
		science lurking in some vague electricity
		where, if we listen we can hear the solitary
		voice of that poet telling us,
		"We are no other than a moving row
		Of Magic shadow-shapes that come and go
		Round with the Sun-illumined Lantern hold
		In Midnight by the Master of the show."

	As the POET reads, we STUDY the audience, mostly YUPPIE CULTURE
	JUNKIES or BOHEMIANS.  Among them, a light-haired woman of twenty-
	eight, soberly dressed, wearing glasses.  She's KATHRYN RAILLY.  And
	it's her beeper that suddenly BEEPS.  BEEP!  BEEP!

				POET'S VOICE (o.s.)
		"The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,
		Moves on:  nor all your Piety nor Wit
		Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,
		Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it."

	BEEP!  BEEP!  Scowling at the outrageous interruption, the POET
	looks up from the text just as RAILLY, tumbling, shuts off the
	beeper and rises, embarrassed.  As she makes her way to an exit,
	the glaring POET continues...POET"Yesterday This Day's Madness did prepare;
		Tomorrow's Silence, Triumph or Despair:
		Drink!  for you know not whence you came, nor why:
		Drink!  for you know not why you go, nor where."INT.  CORRIDOR/POLICE STATION - NIGHTDETECTIVE FRANKI leads RAILLY past crowded holding cells.FRANKI-- so they get there and they ask the guy
		real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets
		agitated, starts screaming about viruses.
		Totally irrational, totally disoriented,
		doesn't know where he is, what day it is,
		alla that stuff.  All they got was his
		name.  They figure he's stoned out of
		his mind, it's some kinda psychotic
		episode, so they're gonna bring him...RAILLYHe's been tested for drugs?FRANKINegative for drugs.  But he took on
		five cops like he was dusted to the
		eyeballs.  No drugs.  You believe that?

	FRANKI pauses, indicating a tiny observation window of thick meshed
	glass in an otherwise solid door, and RAILLY looks through it.

	RAILLY'S POV THROUGH THE WINDOW:  a MAN, his back to her, in
	strait-jacket and prison denims, examining the wall of the padded
	cell with the distorted intensity of a "mental case".RAILLYYou have him in restraints.FRANKIWere you listening?  We got two officers in
		the hospital.  Yeah, he's in restraints, plus
		the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill
		a horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.

	RAILLY'S POV THROUGH THE WINDOW:  the MAN in the cell turns, looks
	right at her.  In spite of the cuts and welts, it's clearly COLE.RAILLYThat would explain the bruises, I
		guess.  The struggle.FRANKIYou want to go in?  Examine him?RAILLYYes, please.  You said he gave a name...FRANKI(unlocking the door)
		James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None
		of the James Coles on the computer match him.
		No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing.
		You want me to go in with you?RAILLY(entering)
		No, thank you.FRANKII'll be right here...just in case.INT.  ISOLATION CELLCOLE stares at RAILLY.  The environment is intensely real...vivid
	colors...each sound, however slight, very distinct, almost loud...
	and yet she appears to him almost like a vision.RAILLYMr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly.
		I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the
		County -- I don't work for the police.
		My only concern is your well being --
		do you understand that?COLEI need to go now.RAILLYI'm going to be completely honest.  I'm
		not going to lie to you.  I can't make
		the police let you go...but I do want
		to help you.  And I want you to trust
		me.  Can you do that, James?  May I
		call you "James"?COLE"James"!  Nobody ever calls me that.RAILLY(frowns, studies him)
		Have you been a patient at County?
		Have I seen you someplace?COLENo, not possible.  Listen, I have to
		get out of here.  I'm supposed to be
		getting information.RAILLYWhat kind of information?COLEIt won't help you.  You can't do anything
		about it.  You can't change anything.RAILLYChange what?COLEI need to go.RAILLYDo you know why you're here, James.COLEBecause I'm a good observer.  Because I
		have a tough mind.RAILLYI see.  You don't remember assaulting a
		police officer...several officers?COLEThey wanted identification.  I don't have
		any identification.  I wasn't trying to
		hurt them.RAILLYYou don't have a driver's license,
		James?  Or a Social Security card?COLENo.RAILLYWhy not?  Most people have some ID.COLEYou wouldn't understand.RAILLYYou've been in an institution, haven't
		you, James?  A hospital?COLEI have to go.RAILLYA jail?  Prison?COLEUnderground.RAILLYHiding?COLEI love this air.  This is wonderful air.RAILLYWhat's wonderful about the air, James?COLEIt's so clean.  No germs.RAILLYYou're afraid of germs?COLEI have to go.RAILLYWhy do you think there aren't any germs
		in the air, James?COLEThis is April, right?RAILLYJuly.COLE(sudden panic)
		July?!RAILLYDo you know what year it is?COLEWhat year is it?RAILLYWhat year do you think it is?COLE1995?RAILLYYou think it's July of 1995?  That's
		the future, James.  Do you think you're
		living in the future?COLE(slightly confused)
		No, 1995 is the past.RAILLY1995 is the future, James.  This is 1989.

	COLE looks stunned.INT.  POLICE STATION CORRIDOR - MORNINGCOLE, bound tightly by the strait-jacket, heavy manacles on his
	ankles, is being escorted down the corridor by two surly POLICEMEN.COLEWhere are you taking me?POLICEMAN #1South of France, buddy.  Fancy hotel.
		You're gonna love it.COLESouth of France?!  I don't want to go
		to the South of France.  I want to make
		a telephone call.

	POLICEMAN #2 smirks as he unlocks a heavy steel door.POLICEMAN #2Zip it, scumbag -- you fooled the shrink
		with your act, but you don't fool us.

	Then, POLICEMAN #2 swings the steel door open and sunlight
	overwhelms COLE, blinding him in a dazzling fury of white light.EXT.  CITY STREET/MINI-VAN - DAYA Mini-van, the kind of vehicle used to transport a half dozen
	prisoners, crawls through a busy street.  The Police Department
	logo is prominent on the side of the van beneath barred windows.INT. COUNTY HOSPITAL/SHOWERS - AN HOUR LATER (MORNING)Fierce spray recalls the decontamination in the future.  COLE
	stands stark naked under the shower while two muscular attendants,
	PALMER and BILLINGS, supervise.

	As PALMER shuts off the water, BILLINGS hands COLE a towel and
	starts inspecting his scalp...BILLINGSLemme see your head, Jimbo, see if you
		got any creepy crawlies.COLEI need to make a telephone call.BILLINGS(pulling Cole's head)
		Gotta work that out with a doctor, Jimbo.
		Can't make no calls 'til the doctor says.COLEIt's very important.BILLINGSWhat chew gotta do, Jimbo, is take it
		easy, relax into things.  We all gonna
		get along fine if you just relax.

	COLE gets the hint of menace in the message and submits to the
	lice inspection, only his eyes revealing his frustration.INT.  HOSPITAL/DAYROOM - HALF AN HOUR LATER (DAY)COLE stands in the doorway, stunned by his first sight of the
	large room.  His eyes go to the heavily-grilled windows where
	light pours in from outside.  Then, to the TV, where a CARTOON
	COMMERCIAL makes raucous noises.

	PATIENTS, in K-Mart street clothes or ratty robes, stare gloomily
	at the TV, or play cards, pace, or just stare blankly.

	BILLINGS is at COLE'S side, beckoning to a patient, JEFFREY MASON,
	a twenty year old white youth dressed in khakis and a plaid shirt.BILLINGSJeffrey.  Yo!  Jeffrey.  This here is James.
		Whyncha show James around?  Tell him the TV
		rules, show him the games an' stuff, okay?JEFFREY(with a sly look)
		How much you gonna pay me?  Huh?  I'd
		be doing your job.BILLINGSFive thousand dollars, my man.  That
		enough?  I'll wire it to your account
		as usual, okay?JEFFREYOkay, Billings.  Five thousand.  That's
		enough.  Five thousand dollars.  I'll
		give him the Deluxe Mental Hospital Tour.

	As BILLINGS walks away chuckling, JEFFREY turns to COLE.JEFFREYKid around, kid around.  It makes them feel
		good, we're all pals.  We're prisoners, they're
		the guards, but it's all in good fun, you see?

	COLE nods and JEFFREY indicates card tables where PATIENTS are
	playing cards, checkers, chess, or working on jig saw puzzles.JEFFREYHere's the games.  Games vegitize you.
		If you play the games, you're
		voluntarily taking a tranquilizer.

	COLE sees a partially completed puzzle of the well-known painting,
	THE PEACEABLE KINGDOM, depicting a serene world of animals in harmony.JEFFREYWhat'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How
		much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.COLEI need to make a telephone call.JEFFREYA telephone call?  That's communication
		with the outside world!  Doctor's
		discretion.  Hey, if alla these nuts
		could just make phone calls, it could
		spread.  Insanity oozing through telephone
		cables, oozing into the ears of all those
		poor sane people, infecting them!  Whackos
		everywhere!  A plague of madness.
			(suddenly sly and confidential)
		In fact, very few of us here are actually
		mentally ill.  I'm not saying you're
		not mentally ill, for all I know you're
		crazy as a loon.  But that's not why
		you're here.  Why you're here is because
		of the system, because of the economy.
			(indicating the TV)
		There's the TV.  It's all right there.
		Commercials.  We are not productive
		anymore, they don't need us to make
		things anymore, it's all automated.  What
		are we for then?  We're consumers.  Okay,
		buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen.
		But if you don't buy a lot of stuff, you
		know what?  You're mentally ill! That's
		a fact!  If you don't buy things...toilet
		paper, new cars, computerized blenders,
		electrically operated sexual devices...
			(getting hysterical)SCREWDRIVERS WITH MINIATURE BUILT-INRADAR DEVICES, STEREO SYSTEMS WITHBRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES, VOICE-ACTIVATED COMPUTERS, AND...A woman orderly, TERRY, turns from the feeble PATIENT she's helping.TERRYTake it easy, Jeffrey.  Be calm.

	Abruptly, JEFFREY stifles his hysteria, takes a deep breath and
	continues, completely calm now.  But COLE isn't listening.  He's
	mesmerized by the TV.JEFFREYSo if you want to watch a particular
		program, say "All My Children" or
		something, you go to the Charge Nurse
		and tell her what day and time the show
		you want to see is on.  But you have to
		tell her before the show is scheduled
		to be on.  There was this one guy who
		was always requesting shows that had already
		played.  He couldn't quite grasp the
		idea that the Charge Nurse couldn't
		just make it be yesterday for him, turn
		back time ha ha.  What a fruitcake!!

	This last thought actually penetrates COLE'S focus on the TV and
	he turns to JEFFREY who's picking up speed again.JEFFREYSeriously, more and more people are
		being defined now as mentally ill.  Why?
		Because they're not consuming on their
		own.  But as patients, they becone
		consumers of mental health care.  And
		this gives the so-called sane people work!
			(hysteria again)WHOOO!  SHOCK THERAPY!  GROUP THERAPY!HALLUCINATIONS!  THERAPEUTIC DRUGS!IGGIDY DIGGIDY DIG!  PERFECT!  THESYSTEM IN HARMONY LIKE A BIG MACHINE...TERRYOkay, that's it, Jeffrey, you're gonna
		get a shot.  I warned you...JEFFREY(calming himself, smiling)
		Right!  Right!  Carried away, heh heh.
		I got "carried away".  Explaining the

	COLE has become preoccupied with a small SPIDER creeping along

	ANGLE ON COLE, in bed, feigning sleep.

	The flashlight clicks off and COLE hears the door close.

	For a long moment the ward is silent except for BREATHING,
	SNORES, occasional MOANS.  Then, COLE hears JEFFREY'S hoarse
	whisper, picking up right where he left off.JEFFREYYou know what "crazy" is?  "crazy" is
		"majority rules".  Take germs for example.

	by PEASANTS.  The projector ZOOMS slowly in on the agonized FACE
	of this MADMAN as we HEAR RAILLY'S VOICE lecturing.

				RAILLY'S VOICE (o.s.)
		According to the accounts of local
		officials at that time, this gentleman,
		judged to be about forty years of age,
		appeared suddenly in the village of Wyle
		near Stonehenge in the West of England in
		April of 1162.  Using unfamiliar words and
		speaking in a strange accent, the man made
		dire prognostications about a pestilence
		which he predicted would wipe out humanity
		in approximately 8OO years.  Deranged and
		hysterical, the man raped a young woman of the
		village, was taken into custody, but then
		mysteriously escaped and was not heard of again.

	WE DISCOVER RAILLY, six years older now, standing at a lectern
	in a pool of light.  She's dwarfed by the giant screen where the
	engraving is replaced by a series of slides of woodcuts showing
	scenes of pestilence in the Middle Ages as she lectures to an
	audience of mostly SCHOLARLY TYPES.

					RAILLY (cont.)
		In 1841, Mackay wrote, "During seasons
		of great pestilence, men have often
		believed the prophecies of crazed
		fanatics, that the end of the world was
		come."  Obviously, this plague/doomsday
		scenario is considerably more compelling
		when reality supports it in some form,
		whether it's the Bubonic Plague, smallpox,
		or AIDS.  In addition to these "natural"
		contagions, there are now technological
		horrors as well:  besides radiation,
		consider our lurking fear of germ
		warfare and its close approximation,
		chemical warfare, which first reared
		its ugly head in the deadly mustard
		gas attacks during the First World War.

	ON THE SCREEN, a SERIES of SLIDES show images of WORLD WAR I
	SOLDIERS in gas masks, in death throes, etc..

				RAILLY'S VOICE (cont. o.s.)
		During such an attack in the French
		trenches in October, 1917, we have an
		account of this soldier...

	ON THE SCREEN, a slide of an old deteriorated photograph shows
	JOSE, the Puerto Rican kid, strapped to a stretcher, being carried
	by SOLDIERS through the trenches during an attack.  JOSE appears
	to be ranting madly as the projector ZOOMS CLOSER on his face until
	the image approximates Munch's famous painting.

				RAILLY'S VOICE (cant. o.s.)
		-- who, during an assault, was wounded
		by shrapnel and hospitalized behind the
		lines where Doctors discovered he had
		lost all comprehension of French but
		spoke English fluently, albeit in a
		regional dialect they didn't recognize.
		The man, although physically unaffected
		by the gas, was hysterical.  He claimed
		he had come from the future, that he was
		looking for a pure germ that would
		ultimately wipe mankind off the face of
		the earth in the year... 1995!

	The AUDIENCE gives a nervous CHUCKLE.

	ON THE SCREEN, a different old photograph of JOSE.  This time
	he's in a military hospital, gaunt, haunted, very ill.

				RAILLY'S VOICE (cont. o.s.)
		Although seriously injured, the young
		soldier disappeared from the hospital
		before more data could be gathered.  No
		doubt, he was trying to carry on his
		mission to warn others, substituting
		for the agony of war...a self-inflicted
		agony we call the "Cassandra Complex".

	As RAILLY continues, we SCAN the AUDIENCE and DISCOVER MARILOU MARTIN,
	RAILLY'S friend, and MARILOU'S HUSBAND, WAYNE CHANG, both listening
	attentively.  Further away, another MAN listens intently.  A MAN with
	shoulder-length carrot-colored hair.  His name is DR. PETERS.
