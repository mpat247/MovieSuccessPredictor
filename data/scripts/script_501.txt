	see a giant outdoor amphitheatre.  There is no SOUND but the WIND.
	As we move closer to the amphitheatre, we can hear SNATCHES OF WORDS
	and PHRASES as though from a public address system.2	EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - PODIUM - DAY - SHOT OF BENin cap and gown, standing in front of a microphone.  The WIND is

		should ask ourselves the one most
		important question: What is the
		purpose of these years, the purpose
		for all this demanding work,
		the purpose for the sacrifices
		made those who love us?  Were
		there NOT a purpose, then all of
		these past years of struggle, of
		fierce competition and of uncom-
		promising ambition would be mean-
		ingless.  But, of course, there
		is a purpose and I must tell it
		to you.  I ask you to remember
		this purpose always and I pledge
		that I shall endeavor to carry it
		with me forever.5	SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE AUDIENCE - DAYstaring at him impassively.6	INTERCUT BETWEEN SHOTSof impassive students, seated, watching; of Ben standing

		Ben.  Most of them have known you

	They look at each other.  Ben is half standing.MRS. ROBINSONHe should be gone for several

	Ben walks toward the door.MRS. ROBINSONWhat are you so scared of?BENI'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.MRS. ROBINSONThen why do you keep running
		away?BENBecause you're going to bed.  I
		don't think I should be up here.

	Mrs. Robinson lets her dress fall to the floor.MRS. ROBINSONHaven't you ever seen anybody
		in a slip before?BENYes, I have -

	He looks up at the portrait of Elaine.BENBut I just - Look - what if Mr.
		Robinson walked in right now?MRS. ROBINSONWhat if he did?BENWell, it would look pretty
		funny, wouldn't it?MRS. ROBINSONDon't you think he trusts us
		together?BENOf course he does.  But he
		might get the wrong idea.
		Anyone might.MRS. ROBINSONI don't see why.  I'm twice as

		Robinson.  This is difficult

		what's real.  I can't -MRS. ROBINSONWould you like me to seduce you?BENWhat?MRS. ROBINSONIs that what you're trying to
		tell me?BENI'm going home now.  I apologize
		for what I said.  I hope you can
		forget it.  But I'm going home

	Benjamin walks out of the door and down the hall.  The
	CAMERA PUSHES with him to the door.  We see the entire
	stairway and part of the downstairs hall.  Ben gets to
	the stairs and starts down.MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICEBENJAMIN?BENYes.MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICEWill you bring up my purse before

		Now if you won't do me a simple

	Ben appears as he slowly climbs the stairs.BENI'm putting it on the top step.MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICEFor God's sake, Benjamin, will
		you stop acting that way and
		bring me the purse?

	Ben gets to the top of the stairs, and starts slowly

	bed and puts the purse down.  As he starts to turn
	back, he looks up at Elaine's portrait.  There is a
	movement reflected in the glass of the portrait.  He
	turns quickly.  Mrs. Robinson, naked, is shutting the
	door to the bedroom behind her.BENOh God.

	She smiles.BENLet me out.

	She turns the lock on the door.MRS. ROBINSONDon't be nervous.BENGet away from that door.MRS. ROBINSONI want to say something first.BENJesus Christ!MRS. ROBINSONBenjamin - I want you to know

	the hall and down the stairs.39	INT. SUNROOM - NIGHTBen rushes into the sunroom and sits down.  SOUND of

		about my future.

	Mr. Robinson takes the glass from him.MR. ROBINSONCome on.  Let's have a nightcap
		together.

	Mr. Robinson turns his back to Ben to mix the drinks.
	Ben takes several deep breaths, straightens his tie
	and checks to see if his fly is okay.  Mr. Robinson
	turns and brings him the drink.BENThank you very much, sir.MR. ROBINSONBen - how old are you now?BENTwenty.  I'll be twenty-one

	Ben sits.MR. ROBINSONI was just telling Ben here he

	the pool are Mr. and Mrs. Braddock, their friends MR.
	and MRS. ARNOLD, and the Arnold children, PETER and
	LOUISE, who are eight or nine.  Watching from across the
	fence on one side of the house: the young girl from next
	door and her boy friend.  Across the fence on the other
	side of the house: a quartet of adults, formally dressed
	as though for a cocktail party, holding drinks and watch-
	ing.  One of them holds a baby.  The Braddocks, the
	Arnolds and their children are dressed in California
	Contemporary Sport Style: the adults in styles infinitely
	too young for them, the children in styles infinitely too
	old for them.

	Mr. Braddock stands alone at the end of the pool near the
	house.  The others are grouped, more or less, at the other
	end.  Mr. Braddock is hamming it up.MR. BRADDOCKHey, over there -- I mean you!
		Your attention please!

	Mr. Braddock has moved over by one of the windows of the
	house, the window into the kitchen.  He speaks quickly -
	in a fake sotto voce - towards the window.MR. BRADDOCKAre you ready in there, feature

	Ben's arms come into view and pull the mask down.

	We are now looking through the mask as we MOVE FORWARD
	down the hall.  Everything is slightly distorted through
	the glass.  Ben's hand comes up again with the breathing
	apparatus in it.

	SOUND: the rythmic PUMPING of air, obliterating the
	SOUND of the people around the pool who seem to be
	applauding and chattering noiselessly.

	We MOVE out of the door and toward the pool.  Mr. Braddock
	is running back and forth, clapping his hands and
	delivering his now soundless pitch.

	We MOVE DOWN the steps and into the shallow end of the
	pool.  Mr. Braddock is moving along the side of the pool,
	motioning toward us to come down to the deep end.  He
	joins Mr. Arnold at the far end of the pool.  They both
	begin to motion us toward them.

	We get to the deep end of the pool.  Mr. Braddock signals
	us with his hand to go under.  He kneels down by the edge
	of the pool and reaches out with his hand and pushes us
	under.  He has a big smile.

	We SURFACE again and PAN AROUND for a last look.  The
	figures, through the slightly distorted glass of the mask
	of Mrs. Arnold and Mrs. Braddock, watching and smiling;
	the neighbors on each side of the house, looking over their
	fences and laughing and pointing; Mr. Arnold nodding
	encouragement and talking; Mr. Braddock on his knees,
	smiling and trying to reach out far enough to push us
	under.  We GO UNDER and SINK to the bottom of the pool.46	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAYOVERHEAD SHOT (HELICOPTER POV)Looking down on the pool, on Ben's black suited body at

	SOUND of Ben's BREATHING APPARATUS, fading into the SOUND
	of the WIND.

	Hold for a few seconds, then:

	SOUND of a dime DROPPING into a pay phone and DIALING.DISSOLVE TO:47	INT. TAFT HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT - CLOSEUP - BENIn a phone booth.  The booth is in the entrance area of
	the hotel between the lobby and the driveway.  Ben holds

	SOUND of her HANGING UP.  Ben hangs up slowly.
	He stands up in the booth, looks around, moves about
	uncomfortably for a few moments, removes his jacket and
	carrying it folded across his arm in front of him,
	leaves the phone booth and crosses to the doors that
	lead to the main lobby.  As he is about to go in, the
	doors open and a group of VERY OLD PEOPLE start coming
	out, filling the doorway and moving very slowly, muttering
	to each other and helping each other out of the door and
	down the steps.  Ben holds one of the doors open for them
	and stands politely to one side.  As they get through,
	Ben starts to move inside.  At that moment, A DOZEN YOUNG
	PEOPLE, dressed as though for a high school dance, push
	him to one side and move past him into the lobby.  He
	moves back against the other door, holding it open and
	allowing them to go in first.  He smiles politely and they
	pay no attention to him at all.  He follows them into the
	lobby.  They move toward the front desk and he moves with
	them.  One of the boys at the front of the group leans in
	and says something to the CLERK behind the desk.

	The clerk points across the lobby and says something to
	him.  There are the SOUNDS of an orchestra PLAYING some-
	where.  The group of young people passes by the desk
	and Ben moves in behind them.  He pauses at the desk and
	looks apprehensively at the hundreds of pigeon holes against
	the wall with the room numbers painted under them and the
	keys dangling suggestively.ROOM CLERKCan I help you, sir!BENWhat?  Oh - no - I'm just -

	He points vaguely in the direction of the other young
	people.ROOM CLERKAre you here for an affair,

	helplessly at the clerk.BENWhat?ROOM CLERKThe Singleman party, sir?BENOh - yes.  The Singleman party.ROOM CLERKIt's in the main ballroom.BENAhh - thank you.

	Ben backs off and turns and starts across the lobby.
	He puts on his jacket as he goes.  He gets to the entrance
	to the main ballroom.  He pauses at the door, looks in.

	What he sees:  People dancing, talking, sitting, etc.
	He turns back toward te lobby.  He stops.

	What he sees:  The room clerk scross the lobby watching
	him.

	Ben flashes a huge smile and points in toward the ballroom
	as though to express his joy at finding the Singleman
	affair inside, then turns back and enters the ballroom.48	INT. BALLROOM - NIGHTAs Ben steps inside.VOICEHello.
