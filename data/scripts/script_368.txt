           as we pull out that we realize it's the engine of a car. Over
           the image we hear a voice talking on a phone.DRIVER O/S...hundred thousand streets in this city,
           you don't need to know the route. You give
           me a time and place, I give you a five
           minute window. Those five minutes I'm
           yours. Whatever goes down I'm yours. Minute
           either side you're on your own...
                         
           As the engine ignites and roars to life we DISSOLVE TO:2 INT. LOW RENT APARTMENT/ KOREATOWN/ L.A. - NIGHT. 2A map of downtown L.A. spread out on a bed, dozens of different
           routes marked in pencil. The voice continues -DRIVER O/S...One last thing. You won't be able to
           reach me at this number again...
                         
           DRIVER hangs up the phone. He folds his map of LA and slips it
           in his duffel bag. A few clothes and other essentials are neatly
           packed inside. He zips the bag shut and takes one last look at a
           cheap TV set. On screen, a movie is playing. On a radio, the LA
           Clippers are taking a pounding from the New York Knicks.3 INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT/ APARTMENT/ KOREATOWN - NIGHT. 3Driver strides through a dimly lit car park, carrying his duffel
           bag. A YOUNG COUPLE emerge from their car after a late night
           out. Driver lowers his eyes, avoiding their gaze as he makes his
           way towards a sleek 1970's Chevelle4 INT/EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ ALVARADO - NIGHT. 4The Clippers-Knicks game plays on the car radio now. Driver is
           only half listening, focused on the road. We see his face in the
           passing neon lights. Feline good looks. Impassive blue eyes.
           Something almost melancholy in his unwavering gaze. He drives
           carefully, letting other cars overtake.5 EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 5Driver glides into the parking lot of another low-rent apartment
           block.29/24/106 INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 6Clutching his duffel bag Driver heads towards the car park
           elevator. Hurrying out in the opposite direction he sees a
           pretty GIRL in her 20's wearing a waitress outfit. Their eyes
           meet briefly, before Driver walks on.7 INT. APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 7Driver heads down the hallway and unlocks the door to his new
           apartment. It's not all that different from his last one. Clean,
           sparse, and anonymous. He doesn't even bother to walk in. He
           tosses his duffel bag inside and locks the door again.8 INT/EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - NIGHT 8Driver's back on the road, the basketball game still playing on
           the radio. He drives past a row of brightly lit Mexican food
           shacks on Silver Lake Boulevard and turns into a run down garage
           lit up with a neon sign - Shannon's Picture Car Warehouse -
           vintage cars.9 INT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - NIGHT. 9SHANNON, the owner of the garage, has a distinctive limp. Driver
           follows him past rows of vintage cars.SHANNON...Plain Jane cheap like you asked for but
           with a hundred and sixty horsepower inside.
           You get any sleep?DRIVERNot this week.
                         
           As Shannon grins we feel the familiarity between them.SHANNONI can offer you some Halcyon.DRIVERWon't work.
                         
           They head past more cars -- Fords, Dodges, Buicks -- until they
           arrive at a plain looking Impala.SHANNONThere she is. Silver Impala. Most popular
           car in the state of California...
                         
           Driver casts his eyes over the unimpressive vehicle then holds
           out his hand for the keys.39/24/1010 INT/EXT. SILVER IMPALA/ TOY DISTRICT/ DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT. 10The basketball game is approaching the end of the third quarter.
           Driver's behind the wheel of the Impala now, cruising past rows
           of dingy toy stores on 3rd Street. He glances at his watch. It's
           9:50. He checks his mirror then turns into a side street.11 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ ELECTRONICS SUPERSTORE/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 11A vast electronics superstore dominates the deserted street.
           Under the pale yellow glow of the street lamps, Driver sees
           signs advertising a `huge blow out weekend sale'. He pulls over,
           making sure he has a good view of the entrance. On the radio,
           the basketball commentator is getting more excited.BASKETBALL COMMENTARY...This is some comeback from the Clippers!
           Only a few minutes ago they looked dead and
           buried!...
                         
           Driver reaches under the seat and pulls out a small handheld
           scanner. He switches it on, tuning it to the right frequency.
           Crackling police dispatches are interspersed with the basketball
           commentary now.POLICE SCANNER...9 Adam 81, what is your current
           location?...Repeat, what is your current
           location?...BASKETBALL COMMENTARY...Another unbelievable three pointer from
           Davis and the Clippers are within five!...
                         
           Out of the corner of his eye Driver sees two MEN approach. He
           doesn't react, expecting them. They cut through the fence with
           bolt cutters and approach the main building. Driver watches them
           pull on their masks, then one of them takes out a shotgun and
           blasts the lock to the front door. Instantly the alarm shrills.
           The only thing Driver does is to turn on his stop watch.BASKETBALL COMMENTARY...Time out Knicks...
                         
           The stop watching keeps ticking away, the siren blaring, the
           commentary continuing, the police scanner crackling.
                         
           The storefront is hidden in shadow, impossible to tell what's
           going on inside. Driver looks at his stop watch. Almost three
           minutes. One of the masked men emerges now, carrying a duffel
           bag. He hurries over and gets in the back of Driver's car
           without a word. There's no sign of the other robber.(CONTINUED)49/24/1011 CONTINUED: 11The commentary continues, so does the crackling on the police
           scanner. Four minutes. Still no sign of the second armed robber.
           His companion in the back starts to look nervous, wondering
           what's happened to his partner.
                         
           Driver doesn't betray a hint of nerves. Four and half minutes on
           his stop watch. Thirty seconds more and he's on his way.
                         
           Suddenly the second robber appears from the shadows, running as
           fast as he can to the getaway car. He jumps into the back seat a
           few seconds short of five minutes and Driver screeches off.12 INT/ EXT. SILVER IMPALA/ STREETS/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 12Driver thunders over the 1st Street bridge towards Boyle
           Heights, then eases his foot off the gas, slowing to a steady
           speed. In the back seat the two armed robbers rip off their
           masks, looking pumped up with adrenalin. Driver studies them in
           his rear view mirror, then swerves right on Mission Street as
           his police scanner crackles to life.POLICE SCANNER...Attention all units...211...Superstore
           on Traction Avenue...Suspects headed
           Eastbound on 1st Street...Driving a Silver
           Impala...
                         
           Driver swings sharply into 4th Street now, crossing the L.A.
           River again, heading back in the same direction he came.POLICE SCANNER...Airships dispatched...Downtown and Boyle
           Heights...All units standby. Repeat, all
           units standby...
                         
           Up ahead, the lights of Downtown L.A. glitter against the night
           sky. Hovering between the neon green glow of the skyscrapers
           Driver sees the red and white glint of a police helicopter. He
           switches off his headlights, turning left on Santa Fe Avenue.13 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ALLEYWAYS/INDUSTRIAL AREA/DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 13The armed robbers watch in tense silence as Driver weaves in and
           out of the industrial alleyways with his lights switched off.
           It's as if he's trying to find his way out of the maze or
           probing to see if there's anyone out there.POLICE SCANNER...1 Baker 11, headed south on Boyle
           Avenue...No sign of suspects...Repeat, no
           sign of suspects...
                         
           The armed robbers look relieved when suddenly a police car
           glides past at the end of the alleyway, its lights also off.(CONTINUED)59/24/1013 CONTINUED: 13It's like catching a glimpse of a passing shark's fin. Driver
           taps the brakes gently, his car sliding to a stop. He stays
           there a moment, then eases the Impala forward, turning in the
           same direction as the black-and-white.14 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ LA RIVER INDUSTRIAL AREA/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 14It's a high-risk strategy but Driver follows the black-and-white
           at a distance, hidden in the darkness, knowing other squad cars
           won't be checking the same route. The police car makes its way
           through the dimly lit industrial zone, unaware it's being
           shadowed. Driver turns his car radio up a whisper.BASKETBALL COMMENTARY...And for the first time in the game the
           Clippers have the lead. 71 to 69. Seven to
           go in the Fourth here at the Staples
           Centre...
                         
           Driver turns the sound back down. Up ahead, the police car
           swings left, disappearing from view. Driver slows down too,
           anticipating the next obstacle. He doesn't have long to wait. In
           the distance he suddenly sees the piercing beam of a police
           chopper's search-lights, sweeping the area one more time.
                         
           Driver floors the gas, speeding straight towards the approaching
           helicopter. The armed robbers are too stunned to protest. They
           just sit there, watching the sweeping searchlights getting
           closer and closer.
                         
           Then suddenly it becomes clear what Driver's doing. Up ahead,
           there's a small underpass below the 7th Street bridge. Driver
           slides the car under the safety of the bridge just before the
           chopper's searchlights spot them.15 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ UNDERPASS/ LA RIVER INDUSTRIAL AREA - NIGHT.15The roar of the helicopter thunders overhead. The underpass is
           crammed with dirty mattresses and shopping carts. Sleeping HOBOS
           can be seen under dirty blankets. Driver waits for the echo of
           the helicopter to fade, then moves forward again.16 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ OLYMPIC BOULEVARD/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 16Gloomy yellow street-lamps shine down on the industrial zone.
           Rows of delivery trucks are parked outside the meat-packing
           factories. Driver cruises cautiously down the deserted street.
           The crackling of the police scanner and the droning of the
           basketball commentary add to the tension. Finally up ahead he
           sees car-lights streaming back and forth on Broadway.DRIVERGet down...(CONTINUED)69/24/1016 CONTINUED: 16The armed robbers lie flat on the back seat, paying Driver more
           respect now.17 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ BROADWAY/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 17There's a steady flow of traffic on Broadway. Driver falls in
           behind the other cars. On the radio, the basketball game is
           still playing.BASKETBALL COMMENTARY...Three thirteen left on the clock.
           Dunleavy calls a time out and it's the
           Clippers by one...
                         
           The passing head-lamps light up Driver's face. There's not a
           trace of emotion in his eyes -- even when he spots a patrol car
           approaching in the opposite direction.BASKETBALL COMMENTARY...Buckle up your seat belts Clippers fans.
           This game really is too close to call...
                         
           The two cars pass each other slowly. Driver sees the cops in the
           Black-and-White peering at the Impala as they head past. He
           turns down the basketball game and focuses on the scanner.POLICE SCANNER...This is 1 David 16...Silver Impala
           headed South on Broadway and

           In the back seat, the armed robbers wait nervously for the
           police dispatch to respond.POLICE SCANNER...1 David 16...why don't you check her
           out...
                         
           As soon as he hears this Driver swerves sharply into the next
           street.18 INT/ EXT. IMPALA/ SIDESTREET OFF BROADWAY/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 18Driver guns around the block now, building up speed.POLICE SCANNER...This is 1 David 16...We lost the suspect

           opposite direction slows down as it sees him but is caught up in
           the flow of traffic, unable to turn round and give chase.POLICE SCANNER...1 David 11...suspect headed West on
           Pico...
                         
           Driver threads his way through the vehicles in front of him, so
           smooth and effortless it's hard to tell how fast he's going. He
           glances up as he hears the dull rumble of a police chopper
           overhead. The helicopter is almost directly above him, swinging
           its search-beam back and forth to get a lock on his position.
                         
           Driver pushes the car as fast as it will go, but there's no way
           of outrunning the chopper. Blue light floods the asphalt around
           him as he guns down Figueroa.POLICE SCANNERAll units...pursuit in progress...silver

           Even now Driver doesn't panic, turning his attention back to the
           basketball game.BASKETBALL COMMENTARYThornton pulls up from behind the arc,
           misses. Rebound New York. One eighteen to
           play...
                         
           Driver swerves sharply towards the sparkling lights of the
           Staples Centre.20 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ STAPLES CENTRE/ PARKING LOT - NIGHT. 20The terraced parking lot looms up ahead. A sign above the
           barrier says `Season Ticket Holders Only'. Driver punches in a
           ticket and roars into the parking lot.21 INT. IMPALA/ STAPLES CENTRE PARKING LOT - NIGHT. 21The Impala screeches from one level to the next. With a game
           going on, the parking lot is almost full. Finally Driver pulls
           into a free parking space.BASKETBALL COMMENTARY...Thirty seconds remaining and all the
           Knicks have to do is run out the clock...
                         
           Driver glances in his side mirror. Behind him, dozens of FANS
           are already streaming out into the parking lot before the game
           is over, hoping to avoid the inevitable traffic.(CONTINUED)89/24/1021 CONTINUED: 21BASKETBALL COMMENTARY...Gordon back to Davis...Davis for
           three...This is unbelievable!...
                         
           The jubilant commentary continues, but Driver isn't listening
           anymore. The game has served its purpose. More fans flood into
           the parking lot. Dozens of cars pull out of their places.BASKETBALL COMMENTARY...What a remarkable comeback...Outplayed
           for most of the game, the Clippers have
           shown incredible resilience...
                         
           Driver glances at the armed robbers and nods. It's time. They
           climb out of the car, merging in with the crowd. Driver watches
           them disappear, then slips on a Clippers cap, climbs out of the
           Impala himself and heads towards another car.22 EXT. STAPLES CENTRE/ DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT. 22Outside the parking lot, the police are waiting, stopping
           anything that looks like an Impala, shining their flashlights
           into the windows. Wearing his Clippers cap and a Clippers
           sticker on his new car, Driver calmly drives past them, making
           his getaway.DISSOLVE TO:23 EXT. FILM SET/ SAN PEDRO/ LOS ANGELES - DAY. 23Driver's face is fixed ahead, sunglasses hiding his eyes. As we
           PULL OUT we see to our surprise that he's wearing a policeman's
           uniform. It's only as we pull out further that we see several
           other `POLICE OFFICERS' sitting in the same fold up chairs,
           reading car magazines and scripts as they're powdered by MAKE-UP
           GIRLS, and realize we're on a movie set.
                         
           Driver glances up from his script and sees another STUNTMAN
           being fitted with an SFX mask. The stuntman now looks identical
           to the STAR of the movie who stands nearby.ASSISTANT DIRECTOR O/SI need you guys to sign this contract...
                         
           Driver takes the form along with all the other stuntmen and
           signs it without a glance.24 EXT. FILM SET/ SAN PEDRO/ LOS ANGELES - DAY. 24Shannon is discussing a car stunt with another AD, using two toy

           Shannon joins the rest of the crew, looking on.2ND UNIT DIRECTOR O/S...ACTION!...Driver floors the gas, screeching out of the alleyway. He
           swerves between several oil drums then straightens up on the
           main road.
                         
           In his rear view mirror he sees a black Dodge Charger appear on
           cue, bearing down on him.(CONTINUED)109/24/1026 CONTINUED: 26Driver slows to forty, like he's supposed to, but the black
           Charger keeps coming at speed.
                         
           Driver's eyes stay fixed on his rear view mirror, judging the
           other car's speed and angle of approach to perfection.
                         
           The Charger slams into the back of Driver's car at sixty miles
           an hour, hitting him just above the left rear wheel.
                         
           Driver's reactions are quick as lightning, counter-steering as
           his Black-and-White goes careening off the road. He keeps the
           car upright long enough to slow it down before it finally flips
           end over end.
                         
           Up ahead, the Charger skids to a showy stop.2ND UNIT DIRECTOR O/S...And CUT!...
                         
           Some clapping and cheering breaks out, but most the crew
           couldn't care less, returning to their cell-phones and shot
           lists. Only Shannon seems interested in Driver, limping over and
           helping him out of his battered Black-and-White.SHANNONNice work, officer...
                         
           Driver spits out some fake candyglass from the shattered
           windscreen.27 INT. NINO'S PIZZERIA/ WESTWOOD - DAY. 27A New York style pizza-by-the-slice restaurant. A WAITER takes a
           delivery of Chinese food at the door and carries it over to a
           table where Shannon is sitting with an old friend, BERNIE ROSE.WAITERHere you go, Mr. Rose.

           get the guy.
                         
           From the way the waiter hurries off we get a sense of Bernie's
           power and authority. He turns back to Shannon, resuming their
           conversation.(CONTINUED)119/24/1027 CONTINUED: 27BERNIE ROSE...You run a perfectly good business. Why
           would you want to change now?SHANNONYou know how much my business made last
           year? Thirty Grand. Takes me six months to
           build a car and a couple of seconds for
           these jerks to write it off on a stunt that
           doesn't even make it into the movie.
                         
           Bernie shakes his head but clearly has a soft spot for Shannon.BERNIE ROSEHow much do you need?SHANNONLet me talk you through it first.BERNIE ROSEThat sounds like a lot.SHANNONDoesn't have to be. The big money teams
           burn through three, four million a year but
           that's `cause they're using half a dozen
           test drivers and a stable of cars.BERNIE ROSEI don't know anything about car racing but
           I assume there's a reason for that?SHANNONSure, but it's not the only way. All I need
           is a hard-used stock car. We start off with
           the small-town action then work our way up.
           There's close to two thousand events out
           there and once we make the Show we're
           talking millions.BERNIE ROSE`Millions'?SHANNONThere's a fortune to be made. Sponsorship.

           you.
                         
           Bernie looks at his friend in mild exasperation then turns away
           as the waiter returns with a handful of chop sticks.BERNIE ROSEThank you, Ron. You sure you don't want any
           of this?(CONTINUED)129/24/1027 CONTINUED: (2) 27SHANNONNo, thanks.

           Bernie Rose can't help grinning at his nerve.SHANNONLook, I wouldn't come to you unless I was
           sure about this.BERNIE ROSECome on, Shannon. How can you be sure? What
           have you got these big money teams don't

           He stares at his friend with quiet conviction.SHANNONI been working with this guy a long time -

           Bernie Rose considers him quietly.BERNIE ROSEBut you don't have the money.SHANNONEverything I own is in metal. I had to sell
           my Bullit car the other day just to pay the
           gas bill. I'm telling you, Bernie, put this

           Shannon's about to reply when they're interrupted by a big bull
           of a man with a gruff voice.NINOWhat are you doing eating Chink food in my
           restaurant?BERNIE ROSEWhat's a Jew doing running a Pizzeria?

           town anyway?NINOWell, I'm back.

           the ground floor then the doors slide open. Driver finds himself
           face to face with the pretty girl he saw the other night. She
           looks a little startled to see him, then recoversPRETTY GIRL (IRENE)Hi...(CONTINUED)149/24/1028 CONTINUED: 28She joins him in the elevator, carrying a grocery bag with some

           Driver presses the fourth floor button even though it's already
           lit. The doors shut and the elevator starts to climb. Driver
           stares out quietly. Irene takes a glance at him, feeling awkward
           in the silence. She looks relieved as the elevator doors finally
           open. Driver steps aside to let her out first.IRENEThank you...29 INT. CORRIDOR/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - MORNING. 29Driver and Irene walk down the corridor in the same direction,
           only a few feet apart. She seems more aware of his presence than
           he is of hers. She reaches the door to her apartment first.IRENEGoodbye...DRIVERGoodbye, ma'am...
                         
           Driver looks at her just long enough not to seem impolite, then
           continues down the corridor, not even glancing back.30 EXT. SAUGUS SPEEDWAY - DAY. 30Bright sunlight. In the distance we see a trail of dust moving
           across the flatland. Everything is silent, then slowly the hum
           of an engine rises as the stock car turns towards us. It
           shimmers in the heat waves, the noise of its engine getting
           louder as it picks up speed.
                         
           Shannon stands with his friend Bernie Rose at the edge of the
           makeshift track, staring at the glittering car with its colorful
           signage advertising everything from Snickers to Cheerios.BERNIE ROSELooks like a chocolate bar. You're gonna

           effortless about the way Driver controls the car. His eyes are
           fixed in concentration, his body tensing only slightly as he
           lifts his foot off the gas and turns the wheel.32 EXT. SAUGUS SPEEDWAY - DAY. 32The glinting vehicle is lost in a cloud of dust, then reappears
           again, moving even faster now. The STOCK CAR'S OWNER, a bearded
           hot-rodder with a t-shirt that says, "Drive it like you stole
           it", joins Shannon with a confident smile.STOCK CAR OWNERTold you she was a beauty...SHANNON(Playing hard to get)

           thoughtfully on the stock car as it finally slows to a stop.33 EXT. RACE CAR/ SAUGUS SPEEDWAY - DAY. 33Driver climbs out of the car. As he looks up he sees Shannon
           limping over with the stock car's owner, a couple of MECHANICS,
           and Bernie Rose.SHANNONLooks a little long in the tooth to me.

           Driver smiles politely, gazing back at him. The stock car's
           owner interrupts the moment between them, holding a stopwatch.STOCK CAR OWNERCouldn't see much wrong with that. You beat
           the fastest lap by more than half a second.DRIVERYou might wanna take a look at the

           owner and his mechanics back to the car. Bernie Rose stares
           after him quietly, thinking to himself. Shannon can feel he's
           getting interested.SHANNONYou gonna give me the four?BERNIE ROSEI'll give you three for seventy percent...34 INT. SUPERMARKET/ ECHO PARK - DAY. 34Tinny supermarket music plays in the background. Driver walks
           past the vast selection of instant coffee brands, bemused by the
           choice. Suddenly he notices something out of the corner of his
           eye. At the far end of the aisle his pretty neighbor, Irene, is
           browsing through the confectionery section. Standing next to her
           is a young boy of six or seven, (BENICIO). He grabs a multi-pack
           of snickers and puts it in Irene's shopping basket. Irene calmly
           picks it out, replaces it on the shelf, and takes a single
           snicker bar for him instead. As Driver watches them, the boy
           turns around and notices him. Driver heads down another aisle
           before Irene sees him too, keeping to himself to himself.35 EXT. CAR PARK/ SUPERMARKET - DAY. 35Driver heads out of the supermarket with a small bag of
           groceries when he spots Irene and Benicio again in the car park.
           Irene sits in a battered Oldsmobile, trying to start the engine.
           She tries several times then gets out in frustration, opening
           the hood and peering at the engine she has no idea how to fix.
           Benicio peers in too, trying to be helpful.(CONTINUED)179/24/1035 CONTINUED: 35Driver hesitates, all his instincts telling him to continue to
           his car and drive away, but as he feels Irene's increasing
           frustration he can't help himself, finally heading over to help.
                         
           Irene looks over and sees him coming, surprised at first, then
           smiling. We watch from a distance as they talk now.

           Irene switches on the TV for Benicio, sitting him down on the
           couch.
                         
           Driver has a sip of water, glancing around the room. He notices
           a few photographs on a side table. Most of them are of Benicio
           and Irene, but one of them shows the little boy standing next to
           a strikingly handsome Latino man.

           are walking home from the bus stop, chatting happily. They look
           like they've just come back from the beach, Irene carrying a
           basket full of towels, Benicio clutching a dusty soccer ball.

           windscreen. Driver's cruising down Hollywood Boulevard, shut off
           from the world outside, listening to `Purple Rain'. The HOOKERS
           and HIPSTERS have taken over the streets while up above
           airbrushed movie stars stare down from their lofty billboards.40 EXT. PARKING LOT/ MINI MALL - MORNING. 40It's early morning and Driver's been driving all night, unable
           to sleep. He heads across the parking lot towards a garishly lit
           mini-mall. Up ahead a small group of GANGBANGERS are hanging out
           with intent. They see him coming and look over intimidatingly.
           Driver's only reaction is to bunch his car keys in his hand, the
           longest key sliding between his second and third fingers like a
           weapon. The gangbangers don't see it but the unflinching look in
           his eyes unnerves them and they look away, letting him pass.41 EXT/ INT. BUFFALO BAR AND GRILL/ LA - MORNING. 41Jukebox music plays in the bar and grill. Driver sits on his

           Driver looks up and sees a burly REDNECK with an unkempt beard
           and a wrestler's physique. The redneck slides into the seat
           opposite him.BEARDED REDNECKYou're Shannon's buddy, right? We met last

           Shannon gives Driver another sly look as he takes her car keys.43 EXT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - DAY. 43The Oldsmobile's engine looks like it hasn't been serviced in
           years. Shannon is bent over the hood.SHANNON...Just my opinion, but I think you should
           consider buying a new car...IRENE(With gentle irony)

           Shannon smiles to himself, sensing her interest in Driver.SHANNONWe been together about five years now. He

           him ever since...(HE GRINS)Only thing he knows is cars...46 INT/ EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ LA RIVER - DAY. 46The car roars along the drainage canals. In the passenger seat
           Benicio looks tense but exhilarated. The car glides past a
           landscape of abandoned shopping carts, garbage bags, and
           shredded tires, picking up speed all the time.47 EXT. LA RIVER - DAY. 47Driver's parked the car now in an area of the drainage canal
           which looks like an oasis. He leans against the vehicle, soft
           rock playing on his radio as he watches Benicio climb a tree.48 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ SILVERLAKE - NIGHT. 48Benicio is asleep in the back of Driver's car now. Driver's
           giving him and Irene a ride back to their apartment. Irene looks
           at Driver, waiting for him to say something, but he keeps his
           eyes fixed on the road.49 INT. BENICIO'S BEDROOM/ IRENE'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT.49Cradling the sleeping Benicio in his arms Driver lays him down
           on his bed. Irene takes off her son's clothes and puts on his

           uncomfortable with the intimate moment between mother and son.50 INT.

           He stares back at her in the silence, both of them looking a
           little uncertain.IRENEI'm sorry if I put you on the spot, you
           know, just showing up like that...DRIVERDon't worry...
                         
           Their eyes stay on each other, the attraction palpable. Driver
           finally breaks the tension, making a tentative move towards the
           door. Irene opens it for him, looking up into his eyes. Driver
           knows he could kiss her, wants to, but something inside holds
           him back. Instead he just offers his help.DRIVERYou need a ride anywhere over the weekend

           Benicio sits in a dentist's chair, looking nervous. Irene sits
           beside him, mimicking his expression, trying to make him relax.51 EXT. DENTISTS/ NORTH HOLLYWOOD - DAY. 51Irene emerges with Benicio from the dentists. The little boy is
           clutching his mouth, making a show of being in pain. Irene
           teases him gently as they walk. Driver waits for them in his
           car, watching them quietly.52 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ ECHO PARK - SUNSET. 52Soft rock plays on the car radio. Irene sits in the passenger
           seat with a smile. Driver looks at her curiously as he drives,
           no idea why she's grinning. Benicio suddenly leans forward and
           changes the radio to a different station -- hard rock blaring
           out. Driver lets it go for a moment, then changes it back.
           Benicio responds, until it becomes a game, Irene laughing now.53 EXT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - DAY. 53The roar of machinery. We see quick shots of Driver's day in the
           garage -- fixing cars, taking out some fruit he's left to ripen
           in his tool box for lunch, working on more engines and frames.
           At the end of the day Driver and Shannon examine the stock car.SHANNON...I still can't believe I bought this
           piece of shit...(CONTINUED)269/24/1053 CONTINUED: 53He grins, looking at Driver.SHANNONI thought maybe we'd take her for a run

           confronting the villains, the screen flickering from color to
           black and white. Driver and Benicio sit on the couch, watching
           the cartoon. From their relaxed body language it's clear some
           time has passed and they know each other a little better.DRIVERWhat's happening now?BENICIOHe's telling him if he doesn't leave the
           earth alone he'll fight him.

           Benicio watches curiously as Driver gets off the couch and
           kneels beside the TV.DRIVERThis is pretty complicated. You watching?
                         
           Benicio nods. Driver suddenly gives the TV set a hard smack and
           the interference stops.DRIVERThink you can remember that?...
                         
           Benicio grins. Driver smiles back then looks away as he hears
           the phone ring. Irene walks out of her bedroom, dressed in her
           waitress's uniform, and answers it.IRENEHello?...Yes?...Yes, this is she...
                         
           Driver sees the look of surprise on Irene's face as she listens
           to the voice on the other end. The doorbell suddenly rings.
           Irene catches Driver's eye and asks him to open it. He heads
           over, checks the spy-hole, then opens the door. A YOUNG WOMAN
           who's sitting for Benicio walks in, looking at Driver curiously.YOUNG WOMAN (IRENE'S FRIEND)Hi...DRIVERHello...BENICIOHi Cindy...

           affectionately.IRENE'S FRIENDIt's 8:30. Teeth. Pyjamas. TV off.BENICIOIt's not the TV. It's a DVD...
                         
           Driver looks back at Irene now. She puts down the phone, forcing
           a smile but still looking distracted.55 INT/ EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 55Irene sits next to Driver in the passenger seat, staring out of
           the window at the glittering fountain in Echo Park.(CONTINUED)289/24/1055 CONTINUED: 55IRENEI've never come this way before...DRIVERIt's a short cut...IRENEThe park looks pretty at night...

           again.DRIVERYou okay?...
                         
           Irene takes a long time to answer, still staring out of the
           window.IRENEThat was my husband's lawyer on the phone.
           He's getting an early release...
                         
           She tries to sound casual. Driver takes the news quietly, even
           though it hits him like a sledgehammer.DRIVERThat's great...IRENEI'm happy for Benicio...
                         
           Driver knows she's trying to explain herself but doesn't say
           anything, driving in silence.
                         
           Up ahead the traffic lights turn red and the car slows to a
           stop.
                         
           Inside, the silence is unbearable. Irene pauses, then looks at
           Driver. He's even more handsome in the shadowy half-light,
           something achingly lonely and melancholy about his stillness.
                         
           She hesitates, then moves her hand towards his, brushing the
           back of his hand, then slipping her fingers between his.
                         
           The gesture is tiny but charged with emotion. They both stare
           out in silence, fingers clasped, then Irene gently withdraws her
           hand, as if nothing's happened.
                         
           Outside the lights change to green.56 INT. IRENE'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - SUNSET. 56The sound of laughter. A sign over the door says, Welcome home

           here today -- even though I know it's
           probably for the food not me...
                         
           His self-deprecating humor gets a chorus of laughter and
           agreement from the guests. Irene is standing next to her friend
           Cindy, looking a little uncomfortable.STANDARD...Anyhow, now that I've completed my MBA
           in catering from Chino Business School...(MORE LAUGHTER)Irene, Benicio and I are finally going to

           the sound of the party echoing down the corridor.58 INT. IRENE'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 58It's nighttime and the party's getting louder. Standard's on the
           phone to someone, trying to hear them over the music.STANDARDI'm sorry, I can't hear you...
                         
           He heads into the bedroom to take the call. The voice on the
           other end is accented and unfriendly.MAN'S VOICE ON THE PHONECan you hear me now, you cunt?

           off the bed and slips on his jacket.60 INT. APARTMENT/ CORRIDOR/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 60Irene is finding the party overwhelming too. She heads out into
           the corridor to have a cigarette when she sees Driver across the
           hallway, locking the door to his own apartment. She hesitates,
           then calls out.IRENEHey...
                         
           He turns around and sees her standing there with a smile.IRENEI'm sorry about the noise. I was going to

           He slips his arm around his son now and continues down the
           corridor, brushing past Driver on his way to empty the trash.
           Driver looks at Irene, then heads off in the same direction as
           Standard and Benicio to take the elevator. The two men stand
           there in charged silence, one emptying the trash, the other
           waiting for the elevator, only Benicio oblivious to the tension.61 EXT/ INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ LA - NIGHT. 61Brooding movie stars look down from the billboards. Driver is in

           Cheese restaurant. We still sense the distance between Standard
           and Irene, but Benicio seems completely unaware of it, talking
           excitedly as he eats his pizza. Standard reaches out and takes
           Irene's hand gently as he listens to his son.65 OMITTED 6566 INT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVER LAKE BOULEVARD - DAY. 66A noise of hammering and drills. The corporate signage has been

           Driver applies a blow torch to his car, so absorbed in his work
           he doesn't hear Bernie Rose approach.BERNIE ROSE O/SHow you doing?...
                         
           Driver hears him and turns off the blow torch, standing up
           respectfully. Bernie Rose gives him a friendly smile.BERNIE ROSESo, when's our first race?DRIVERSoon.BERNIE ROSEYou gonna be ready?
                         
           There's something gently challenging in his gaze.DRIVERI hope so...BERNIE ROSECautious man. Like myself. Don't wanna make
           promises you can't keep...
                         
           Driver smiles but doesn't respond. Bernie Rose finds him as hard
           to talk to as everyone else. Across the garage, Nino sits in the
           T-Bird with Shannon, still fucking with him. Bernie watches
           them.BERNIE ROSEHe ever tell you how we met?(CONTINUED)359/24/1066 CONTINUED: (2) 66Driver shakes his head.BERNIE ROSEI did some producing back in the 80's.
           Interesting pictures. Kind of European.
           Shannon arranged the cars for us and did
           all the stunts. I knew he was overcharging
           me but I loved having him around. His next
           business venture he tried the same thing
           with some of Nino's friends they broke his
           spine. He never had much luck...
                         
           He's about to continue when they're interrupted by a familiar
           voice.STANDARD O/SHey!...
                         
           Driver turns around and sees Irene's husband, Standard, heading
           towards him with a confident smile.STANDARDYou got a minute? I want to -BERNIE ROSEWe're talking...
                         
           Bernie Rose barely raises his voice but it's full of quiet
           menace and authority. Standard pauses, stung, but instinctively
           senses this is someone you don't mess with.STANDARDI'll wait outside...
                         
           Bernie Rose watches him leave with a look of contempt, then
           turns back to Driver with a smile, resuming their conversation.BERNIE ROSEThe reason I'm telling you this is because
           he's got a lot invested in you. So do I...
                         
           Their eyes stay on each other with just a hint of tension.BERNIE ROSEAnything you need just let me know...
                         
           Driver nods. Bernie Rose studies him a moment, then finally
           walks away.67 EXT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVER LAKE BOULEVARD - DAY. 67Driver joins Standard in the forecourt of the garage, the midday
           sun blazing down on them.(CONTINUED)369/24/1067 CONTINUED: 67STANDARDIrene told me you'd fixed our car. How much
           do I owe you?DRIVERDon't worry about it.STANDARDI do worry. I like to pay my debts.
                         
           Driver senses the quiet pride in his voice, and lets it go.DRIVERCall it fifty.
                         
           Standard counts out some bills from his tattered wallet, his
           eyes lowered.STANDARDI was thinking of trading her in for a new
           car. Something fast and cheap.DRIVERYou can't have both.STANDARDAlright then, fast.
                         
           Even though he smiles Driver senses just a hint of tension on
           his handsome face.DRIVER(Pointing to a car)
           Something like that Buick over there'll
           cost you nine grand but there isn't much

           faster than sixty five.
                         
           Standard considers the car a moment, something clearly bothering
           him, then looks back at Driver.STANDARDYou must think I'm an asshole?
                         
           Driver isn't sure what he's getting at.DRIVERI wouldn't know.STANDARDWell, I am. Six months inside for holding
           somebody else's stolen shit...
                         
           He smiles ironically, his gaze still fixed on Driver.(CONTINUED)379/24/1067 CONTINUED: (2) 67STANDARDI appreciate what you did for my family
           when I was away but I don't plan to fuck up
           a second time...
                         
           It's a thinly veiled message that he's back and here to stay.
           Driver stares back at him when Shannon emerges from the garage
           with Bernie Rose and Nino, calling out.SHANNONHey, kid! Come say goodbye, the money
           people are leaving!...
                         
           Driver and Standard stare at each other a moment longer then
           Driver breaks off.DRIVERExcuse me.STANDARDSee you around...
                         
           Driver walks off, leaving Standard alone with his thoughts.
           Shannon watches Standard curiously as Driver approaches.SHANNONWho was that?DRIVERIrene's husband.SHANNON(GRINNING)What did I tell you about married women?
                         
           Nino can't resist another dig at Shannon.NINOWhat the fuck do you know about married
           women?BERNIE ROSECan you for once say something without the
           word fuck in it?
                         
           As they continue their banter, Driver glances at Standard. He's
           walking back to his car, dialling someone on his cell phone.68 INT/EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ MEXICAN RESTAURANT/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 68Passing traffic blurs past. Through the windows of a Mexican
           restaurant we see Irene at work, serving tables in her
           waitress's uniform.(CONTINUED)389/24/1068 CONTINUED: 68Driver's parked across the street, watching her from his car. He
           hesitates, conflicted, then finally gets out of the car.69 INT. MEXICAN RESTAURANT/ BROADWAY/ DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT. 69Irene walks out of the kitchen with a tray of food, then stops
           as she sees Driver sitting at a booth. She looks surprised to
           see him, but pleased, serving her table first then heading over.IRENEHi...DRIVERHi...
                         
           Their eyes stay on each other, oblivious to the noise.IRENEWe haven't seen you around in a while. You
           must have been pretty busy?...DRIVERYou look pretty busy yourself...
                         
           She smiles, glancing at the tables she's supposed to serve.IRENEWhat can I get you?DRIVERI already ate. I just wanted to see how you
           were?
                         
           His concern touches her and makes her uncomfortable at the same
           time.IRENEWe're okay. Standard thinks he may have
           found a job so I can give up my night
           shift...

           herself.IRENEI better serve some food...
                         
           It's only when she has her back turned that we see how hard this
           is for her. Driver watches her walk away, lost in thought.70 INT. KITCHEN/ MEXICAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT. 70Irene piles some plates of tacos on her tray, bracing herself to
           go back out and face Driver -- but when she finally walks out
           again he's no longer there.71 INT/ EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ APARTMENT BLOCK/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 71Driver leans out of his car window and inserts a key to open the
           gates of the underground car park.72 INT/ EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ UNDERGROUND CAR PARK - NIGHT. 72As Driver descends into the darkness of the car park, he sees a
           group of SHADOWY FIGURES walking in the opposite direction,
           heading up the ramp, one of them being pushed in a wheelchair.
           Their leader, a large, balding man, (COOK), glances in Driver's
           direction then looks away.
                         
           Driver cruises past the mysterious group and winds his way
           further down the car park. Suddenly he notices something else in
           the shadows. A figure lies sprawled against one of the pillars.
           A smaller figure kneels a few feet away. Driver stops his car
           now, climbing out to see what's happened.
                         
           The prone figure groans in pain. As Driver approaches he
           realizes it's Standard. His face is covered in blood and he
           clutches his ribs. The smaller figure is Benicio. He stares at
           his father helplessly, then looks up at Driver in tears. Driver
           kneels beside Standard, checking nothing's broken.DRIVERCan you move?STANDARDWhere's Benicio?DRIVERHe's right here...
                         
           Driver glances at Benicio. He looks terrified. Standard raises
           his head painfully and looks at his son.(CONTINUED)409/24/1072 CONTINUED: 72STANDARDIt's okay, Benicio. I'm okay...

           understand? This is between you and me.
                         
           Benicio nods, too choked-up to speak. Standard turns to Driver.STANDARDCan I use your bathroom to clean up? I
           don't want Irene to come home and see me
           like this...73 INT. BATHROOM/ DRIVER'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 73Standard is bent over the sink, splashing water on his face. As
           he turns off the tap he notices how neatly Driver's laid out his
           toothbrush, shaving cream, and razor. He finally turns around
           and looks at Driver.STANDARDThanks. Sorry about getting all this blood
           everywhere...
                         
           He's still shaken but tries to pass it off with a smile.STANDARDFucking punks took me by surprise...

           Driver doesn't answer, waiting for him to continue. Standard
           hesitates, still not sure whether to trust him.STANDARDYou ever been inside?DRIVERWhy?(CONTINUED)419/24/1073 CONTINUED: 73Standard takes another glance at the items laid out neatly by
           the sink.STANDARDI owed some protection money in the joint.
                         
           Driver begins to see how worried he is.DRIVERHow much?STANDARDThey want twenty thousand. I told them I
           couldn't pay so they want me to do a job
           for them...DRIVERIs that why you need a car?
                         
           Standard stares back at him.STANDARDWhat did you say you were inside for?DRIVERI didn't.
                         
           A beat, then he finally opens up.STANDARDIt's a pawn shop in the valley. I tried to

           Driver stares at him in surprise now, more concerned than he
           shows.DRIVERWhy don't you take them away?STANDARDWhere would I go? Irene finds out I fucked
           up again I'll lose everything...
                         
           He sounds upset, angry with himself.STANDARDThis lousy job's my only way out...

           shirt, then walks out of the bathroom to check on Benicio.429/24/1074 INT. LIVING ROOM/ DRIVER'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 74Benicio is watching a baseball game on TV, his back to Driver.DRIVERYou okay?

           his ordeal.DRIVERYou want something to drink?
                         
           Benicio shakes his head, trying to hide his tears. Driver heads
           over, then stops as he notices something in Benicio's hand. The
           little boy is clutching it as if he's afraid to let go.DRIVERWhat have you got there?...
                         
           Benicio holds out his hand to reveal a small bullet. Driver

           and carrying him back to his bedroom. Driver watches them. Even
           in this kind of mood Standard's clearly devoted to his son.

           Driver sees the deep concern in her eyes and feels even more
           torn. Irene gets up, clearing away some plates.79 INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 79Driver strides through the parking lot and climbs in his car.80 INT. CAR/ UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 80Driver sits in the car as if it's his retreat from the world. He

           another anonymous LA store front. Driver's parked the car a
           hundred yards from the entrance, his police scanner crackling.
           Standard sits beside him in the passenger seat, looking tense.DRIVERYou don't have to do this.STANDARD(Forcing a smile)

           He tries to make light of it but doesn't sound convincing. Out
           of his window he sees Blanche cross the street and enter the
           pawn shop and looks even more nervous now.STANDARDIrene and Benicio think the world of you,

           Driver watches him cross the street with a strong sense of
           foreboding. Standard enters the pawn shop. Driver starts his
           stopwatch now, listening to the seconds tick away.
                         
           He casts his eyes around the street, observing the smallest
           details -- the number plates of other vehicles; the windows of
           overlooking buildings.
                         
           The white hot sun blazes down, reflecting on the pawn shop
           windows, hiding everything inside.
                         
           The police scanner crackles but picks up no activity. Driver
           listens to his stop watch, in his own world. He starts the
           engine and sets off, cruising slowly past the pawn shop, heading
           for the corner where he told Standard he'd be waiting.
                         
           He pulls over by the curb when suddenly he notices something.
           Parked a hundred yards down the road he sees another vehicle
           glinting in the sunlight. To the ordinary eye it's no different
           from the other cars parked nearby, but to Driver it stands out.
           For one, it's a Chrysler. Secondly, it has reinforced bumpers
           and racing tires.
                         
           Driver's stopwatch shows four minutes now. He looks away from
           the Chrysler, gazing at the doors of the pawn shop, expecting
           Standard and Blanche to burst out at any moment.
                         
           But there's no sign of them.
                         
           The seconds tick away. Five minutes. Driver hesitates, all his
           instincts telling him to drive off, but he stays where he is,
           thinking of Irene.
                         
           Suddenly he sees Standard and Blanche emerge from the pawn shop,
           Standard clutching a big black gym bag in his hand.(CONTINUED)499/24/1081 CONTINUED: (2) 81He smiles at Driver as he approaches when suddenly he hears the
           crack of gunshots behind him. Driver sees the look of panic on
           his face as he spins around.
                         
           A GUY IN A SUIT strides out of the pawn shop. Crouching low in
           an expert firing position he squeezes off several shots. The
           force of the bullets sends Standard flying.
                         
           Driver sees him hit the sidewalk, arterial blood pumping from
           his neck. Blanche screams, grabbing the gym bag and leaping into
           the back seat of the car. Driver hesitates, takes one last look
           at Standard's lifeless body, then hits the gas as more gunshots
           crack behind him.
                         
           As Driver's car roars down the street, the Chrysler suddenly
           comes to life, pulling out of its parking place.82 INT/ EXT. CAR/ STREET/ TARZANA/ LA - DAY. 82Driver glances in his rear-view mirror and sees the Chrysler on
           his tail. It doesn't seem to be trying to close the gap, just
           following at a discreet distance. In the back seat, Blanche zips
           open the gym bag, then stares in shock.BLANCHE...Christ, there wasn't supposed to be this
           much money!...
                         
           There are literally stacks of hundred dollar bills crammed
           inside the gym bag. Driver catches her reaction in the mirror,
           but his attention is focussed on the Chrysler. Up ahead, at an
           intersection, the lights turn red. Driver thinks about running
           them, but decides against it, braking sharply. The Chrysler
           draws up beside him, its windows glinting in the sunlight.BLANCHEMove for Chrissakes!...
                         
           Driver ignores her, still watching the Chrysler out of the
           corner of his eye. The lights change to green but Driver doesn't
           move. Nor does the Chrysler. Behind them, other cars start
           honking their horns. Suddenly Driver roars off, swerving left at
           speed.
                         
           The Chrysler reacts, screeching off in pursuit.
                         
           Driver floors the gas. On speed and power his vehicle may be no
           match for the Chrysler, but in traffic the odds are even. He
           weaves his way past the slower cars, putting obstacles between
           himself and the Chrysler. The pursuing car matches him move for
           move, staying on his tail.
                         
           In the back seat, Blanche looks terrified, buckling herself in.(CONTINUED)49A9/24/1082 CONTINUED: 82Driver swerves left then suddenly makes a hard right onto a
           deserted canyon road. The mustang somehow manages to make
           the same turn. It gets close enough to "pit" Driver, its nose
           pressing against the rear corner of Driver's vehicle. 
                         
           Driver's almost run off the road, but manages to save it and
           regains control of his car.
                         
           The Mustang pulls out wide to build momentum and smash into
           him. As it moves in to deliver the knockout blow, Driver
           pulls the Emergency Brake and spins 180 degrees, causing the
           Mustang to miss and lose control for a brief moment.
                         
           Now the two cars are nose to nose, barrelling down the road,

           closing fast.
                         
           It rams Driver's front bumper. BAM! The two cars separated
           for an instant.
                         
           The Mustang guns it, ready to smash into Driver again...
                         
           Driver clocks an upcoming three way intersection dotted with
           construction equipment. In a last ditch attempt to evade his
           pursuer he throws a reverse 180, then incredibly keeps going,
           spinning 270 degrees.
                         
           The Mustang tries to make the same turn, but this time the
           maneuver is beyond his ability. Driver's suckered him into a
           corner he can't control. 
                         
           The Mustang crashes into the construction equipment in a
           sickening crunch of metal on metal.

           handle of the motel room starts to turn, slowly -- then suddenly
           there's the roar of a shotgun from the bathroom.
                         
           Driver reacts in an instant, rushing towards the bathroom door.

           through. One quick glance and he knows she's dead - half her
           head blown off. Another quick glance and he sees her killer, a
           big burly HITMAN, trying to climb through the same bathroom
           window where he just shot her.
                         
           Driver moves like lightning, grabbing the man's arms before he
           can get off another shot and pulling him through the window. The
           hitman lands heavily in a sea of broken glass, cutting his
           forehead open, blinded momentarily by the blood in his eyes.
                         
           Driver takes his opportunity and slams the man's face back into
           the glass strewn floor, stunning him for a few more seconds as
           they struggle. Crawling away, he grabs the towel rack and pulls
           the metal bar off the wall. Using it as a spear he impales the
           hitman and grabs his shotgun.88 INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY. 88In the bedroom, the 2nd HITMAN finally kicks the door open.
           Driver bursts through the bathroom door at the same time --
           firing the 1st shooter's shotgun. The force of the blast picks
           up the 2nd hitman and flings him against the wall like a rag
           doll.

           can hear the sound of raised voices. Bernie Rose grabs the TV
           remote and turns up the volume to drown out his neighbors.BERNIE ROSEThey've been going at it ever since they

           passing some half naked STRIPPERS at the bar. There's a handful
           of CLIENTS watching a pole dance, but otherwise the place is
           empty. Driver turns down a long corridor. A couple of STRIPPERS
           emerge from their changing room, surprised to see him, but he
           puts them at ease with a friendly smile.DRIVERCook moved office again?STRIPPERThat one over there...

           waits, then suddenly kicks the door open, right in Cook's face.
                         
           Before Cook can recover, Driver storms into the office, smashing
           him across the shoulder with the hammer. Cook collapses in a
           heap. Driver's about to hit him again, when he sees that Cook's
           left hand is broken and there are cuts and bruises on his face.
           Someone's clearly given him a beating since the robbery.DRIVERShould've figured you for a shill. Who were
           you fronting for?COOKFuck you -
                         
           Driver smashes the hammer into Cook's right hand now, breaking
           it too. Cook screams. Some of the strippers have gathered at the
           door but Driver couldn't care less.DRIVERWhose money am I holding?COOKDon't worry. They'll come get it. You don't
           know who you're fucking with -

           Fuck you...
                         
           The strippers look stunned and riveted at the same time. Driver
           bends over Cook and rifles through his pockets. Finally he finds
           what he's looking for. Cook's cell phone. He scrolls down the
           call log and finds the same number appearing again and again.97 OMITTED 97599/24/1098 INT. NINO'S PIZZERIA - DAY. 98The kitchen is busy, CHEFS taking out hot pizzas from the oven

           on the panel descend. The elevator bell finally rings as they
           reach the lower level. Tan Suit hesitates, but Driver waits for
           him to go out first. He nods goodnight and heads off into the

           Bullets spark as they hit the concrete floor and the other

           More sparks light up the darkness, the bullets penetrating the
           car with ease, narrowly missing Driver and Irene.
                         
           Driver moves again, dragging the terrified Irene behind him. Tan
           Suit loses sight of them in the darkness, striding past rows of
           parked cars.(CONTINUED)659/24/10107 CONTINUED: (2) 107Driver turns to Irene as they take cover behind a pillar. She

           Tan Suit hears him and opens up again, more bullets lighting up

           Crouching behind another vehicle, Driver sees this and takes his
           chance, darting out after his pursuer. Tan Suit sees him coming
           and runs, the hunter becoming the hunted now.
                         
           Still lying on the ground, Irene listens to their echoing
           footsteps.
                         
           Driver runs after Tan Suit through the darkness, gaining all the
           time. Tan Suit looks desperate now, tiring. He turns to face his
           pursuer but Driver's on him in a flash, hurling him against a
           car.
                         
           Tan Suit slams into the car, losing his balance. Driver grabs

           Irene's watching from the shadows, stunned by the violence. She
           picks herself up and runs towards the elevator.
                         
           Driver keeps slamming Tan Suit against the car, beating the
           resistance out of him. As his body begins to slump, Driver grabs
           him by the throat and rams his head into a car window.
                         
           The glass splinters with blood, the force of the blow shattering
           Tan Suit's skull.
                         
           Driver looks around for Irene now and sees her standing in the
           elevator, framed against the light.
                         
           She stares back at him, but makes no attempt to step out.

           gonna invest it here in LA, try to run a
           rival operation. I wanted to teach him a
           lesson...
                         
           The lights in the restaurant gradually fade as Cook shuts the
           blinds.BERNIE ROSE(INCREDULOUSLY)You stole from the East Coast mob?NINOI stole from a jumped up punk who was gonna
           step on our business -(CONTINUED)689/24/10110 CONTINUED: 110BERNIE ROSEAnd where did this punk find a million
           dollars? You ever consider he may have
           consulted some higher-ups? You even bother
           to check? -NINOI don't give a fuck who gave him their
           blessing. This is my city -BERNIE ROSEYour city? This is a big city, pal, and
           last time I checked we were partners! -NINOWe are partners -BERNIE ROSEThen why the fuck didn't you come to me
           before you set up your dummy robbery or
           hired this fucking amateur?!...
                         
           Cook sits back down at the table, having closed the blinds. Nino
           looks almost embarrassed for once.NINOThis was off to the side, Bernie. I didn't
           wanna involve you.BERNIE ROSEWell, now you fucked up I am involved.
           Anyone finds out you stole from the family
           they'll kill both of us -NINOWhat family? These fucks still call me a
           kike to my face. I'm fifty nine years old,
           they pinch my cheek, treat me like a
           fuckin' kid. They're the reason we left New
           York in the first place. Decrepit old men
           waving us over to their dinner and domino
           tables to complain.BERNIE ROSEThose old men gave us the funds to move out
           here.NINOAnd I made them a lotta money. I made you a
           lotta money too...
                         
           He stares at Bernie, genuinely indignant now.(CONTINUED)699/24/10110 CONTINUED: (2) 110NINOI pay them half of everything I fucking
           earn and then they set up some fucking kid
           from Philadelphia just because he's a
           fucking wop!
                         
           There's a hint of sympathy in Bernie's eyes.BERNIE ROSEThe money always flows up, Izzy. You know
           that.
                         
           He calls Nino by his childhood name now, emphasizing the fact
           that they're both outsiders in this organization. For the first
           time Nino's tough guy act slips and he looks anxious.NINOThat's why this driver has to go. Him, and
           maybe your friend Shannon, are the only two
           people who can tie me to the robbery.BERNIE ROSEWhat about this prick?
                         
           He doesn't even bother to look at Cook.COOKMr. Paolozzi -NINOShut up...
                         
           The two friends stare at each other as if Cook didn't exist.BERNIE ROSEAre you asking my permission?NINOI'm asking for your help. I shoulda' come
           to you first, Bernie. I know that. We're a
           team.
                         
           He stares at Bernie apologetically, appealing to their
           friendship.NINOI'll pay you back the three hundred you
           spent on the race car.BERNIE ROSEIt's not about the money...
                         
           He stares out quietly, torn.(CONTINUED)709/24/10110 CONTINUED: (3) 110BERNIE ROSEAll right...
                         
           Nino nods in gratitude.BERNIE ROSE(TO COOK)Pass the salt...
                         
           Cook hesitates, thinking Bernie's fucking with him for having
           two broken hands. He stares back dumbly and it's the final
           straw. Bernie suddenly grabs a stainless steel fork and rams it
           in his eye. As Cook screams, Bernie takes a knife and buries it
           in his neck. He twists the knife deeper for good measure, then
           with one powerful sweep of his arm clears Cook off the table.
                         
           Cook's not dead yet, just writhing on the floor, choking on his
           own blood. Bernie Rose keeps his eyes fixed on Nino.BERNIE ROSEYour turn to clean up after me...

           The CREW are setting up for their first shot of the day. In the
           background we see a DIRECTOR blocking out an action scene.
           Driver walks past without even a glance, heading towards the
           make-up trailer. He opens the door and walks in, looking around
           the trailer until he finds what he's looking for -- the SFX mask
           he saw previously on the film set.111 INT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - MORNING. 111Shannon limps down the steps from his office with a suitcase in
           his hand. He heads into the main garage then suddenly stops.
           Bernie Rose stands beside the stock car, waiting for him.BERNIE ROSEAll these priceless cars, you should get
           better locks...SHANNONDoor's always open to you...

           city a year, he had to pick the wrong one.SHANNONHe tried to put it right.BERNIE ROSEPicked the wrong guy for that too. My
           partner's a belligerent asshole with his
           back against the wall...
                         
           He stops, facing Shannon.BERNIE ROSERight now so am I. I don't take care of
           this I'm in big trouble...
                         
           He stares at his old friend.BERNIE ROSEAny idea where he is?SHANNONProbably across the border by now. Mexico.
           Belize. That's where I'd go...
                         
           Bernie Rose smiles, not believing a word.BERNIE ROSEHe just walked out on you after everything
           you've done for him, took all the money?SHANNONThat's gratitude, I guess.
                         
           Bernie Rose can't help grinning, fond of Shannon despite
           everything.BERNIE ROSEI ever tell you how long Izzy and I been
           friends? Since we were six. Only Jews in a
           neighborhood of wops. Long as I can
           remember he was getting me into trouble and
           I was getting him out of scrapes...
                         
           He looks almost apologetic.(CONTINUED)729/24/10111 CONTINUED: (2) 111BERNIE ROSEAnyone else I'd take your side...SHANNONAnyone else I'd do the same...
                         
           Bernie Rose watches him with a mixture of affection and regret.BERNIE ROSEWhat's this fucking kid to you anyway?
                         
           Shannon shrugs, no idea himself.BERNIE ROSEI leave here without finding out where he
           is, there'll be others coming after me. I
           guarantee they'll be too stupid to figure
           out you won't talk and drag this out
           unnecessarily...SHANNONThen I'm glad you got here first...
                         
           Bernie Rose holds his gaze, then looks away, admiring the shiny
           stock car.BERNIE ROSEYou know, it's too bad, I was getting
           excited about our race team, having my name
           all over the car. I think we could have
           made something of this business...SHANNONNah, I'd have fucked it up too...
                         
           Shannon smiles, reconciled with himself. Bernie Rose grins, and
           extends his hand. They shake hands firmly, like old friends,
           when suddenly Shannon recoils, as if he's been stung.
                         
           We see now that his shirt sleeve is covered in blood, his vein
           cut all the way from his elbow to his wrist. He looks dazed,
           paralysed with shock.
                         
           Bernie Rose holds a razor knife in his hand, the blade wet with
           Shannon's blood. He takes Shannon gently by the arm and sits him
           down against the boot of the stock car.BERNIE ROSEYou won't feel a thing. Close your eyes and
           you'll fall asleep...
                         
           Shannon stares out numbly, the life ebbing out of him. Bernie
           Rose watches him quietly, wiping his bloody razor with a
           handkerchief.739/24/10111a INT. BERNIE ROSE'S APARTMENT - DAY. 111a
                         
           Bernie Rose replaces the razor knife in a small lacquered box
           full of other knives. From next door he can hear his neighbors
           arguing again. He stands there a moment, deflated, then suddenly
           storms towards his front door.

           There's something threatening in the old mobster's eyes now. The
           husband moves to close the door but Bernie jams it open with his
           elbow, shoves him aside, then looks over at the wife.BERNIE ROSEYou all right, Shonda?

           He jerks the husband's neck forward, making him nod.BERNIE ROSEYou're lucky to have her, lucky she's put
           up with you this long. Lucky I've put up
           with you. She has good reason: she loves

           stop raising your voice or fucking move...
                         
           He lets go of the terrified man and storms out again.112 INT/ EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ RESEDA BOULEVARD - DAY. 112Sunlight glints on the parked vehicles by the curb. Driver slows
           down as he approaches the sign for Shannon's Custom Kings,
           glancing out of the window to see if anyone's staking out the
           garage. Satisfied there's no-one there, he drives through.113 INT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ RESEDA BOULEVARD - DAY. 113Driver pulls open the garage door and sees the rows of vintage
           cars shimmering in the shafts of sunlight. As he heads past the
           vehicles he suddenly spots a figure slumped against the stock
           car. Shannon's eyes have been closed, his head resting gently
           against the trunk of the car.
                         
           Driver kneels down and lifts him up in his arms, holding him for
           a second, then lays him down on the floor. He turns back and
           opens the car boot now, revealing the black gym bag full of
           money.114 EXT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ RESEDA BOULEVARD - DAY. 114Driver's car roars out of the garage.115 INT. NINO'S PIZZERIA - SUNSET. 115Nino stands in the kitchen, wearing a beautiful suit but no
           shoes or socks, listening on his cell phone. We hold on the
           curious image for a moment, then reveal a beautifully dressed
           WOMAN polishing his shoes. And now we see more of Nino's MEN,
           also smartly dressed and accompanied by GORGEOUS WOMEN, getting
           ready for an event. Nino's talking to his wife on the phone.NINOAlright honey, I'll pick you up in an hour.116 EXT. NINO'S PIZZERIA - SUNSET. 116Two big Lincoln Towncars are parked outside. Across the road we
           recognize Driver's car. He opens the trunk. When he closes it
           again we see that he's wearing the eerily convincing SFX mask.
           He crosses the road, entering the pizzeria.759/24/10117 INT. NINO'S PIZZERIA - SUNSET. 117Several of Nino's men look up as Driver enters but none of them
           recognize him.NINO'S GUYWe're closed...
                         
           Driver stares past them at Nino in the kitchen, surrounded by
           more of his men. We feel his mind calculating then he walks out
           again.118 EXT. NINO'S PIZZERIA - NIGHT. 118Nino emerges with his bodyguards now, heading towards one of the
           white Lincolns.NINO(To one of his men)

           Across the road Driver climbs into his car, still wearing the
           mask. He starts his car, setting off after Nino's Lincoln.119 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ NINO'S PIZZERIA/ WESTWOOD - NIGHT. 119Driver drifts in behind a couple of other cars, keeping them
           between himself and the Lincoln.120 EXT. STREETS - NIGHT. 120The sunlight is fading fast. The neon cityscape has come to life
           and the streets are a sea of glittering lights.121 INT. NINO'S CAR/ STREETS - NIGHT. 121The CHAUFFEUR checks his mirror as he turns into another street,
           seeing only the anonymous glare of headlights behind him.122 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ STREETS - NIGHT. 122Driver slows down and lets another car turn in front of him,
           keeping it between himself and Nino's car.123 EXT. STREETS - NIGHT. 123The streets are less crowded in this residential area. As the
           car in front of Driver pulls into its front drive, Driver takes
           the next turning, making sure the Lincoln doesn't spot him.769/24/10124 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ PARALLEL STREET - NIGHT. 124Driver cruises along another residential street. At every
           intersection we glimpse the Lincoln heading in the same
           direction down a parallel street.125 EXT. SAN VINCENTE BOULEVARD/ BRENTWOOD - NIGHT. 125The Lincoln turns back into traffic on San Vincente.126 INT. NINO'S CAR/ SAN VINCENTE BOULEVARD - NIGHT. 126Nino's talking on a cell phone in the back seat.NINO...Sure, Carlo, I'll send him your

           front of him until he has Nino's Lincoln back in his sights.128 EXT. AERIAL VIEW/ SAN VINCENTE BOULEVARD - NIGHT. 128The sun has almost set, the red backlights of the cars blinking
           in the fading light.129 INT. NINO'S CAR/ SAN VINCENTE/ 7TH STREET - NIGHT. 129Nino's car turns into 7th Street.130 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ SAN VINCENTE/ 7TH STREET - NIGHT. 130This time there are no other vehicles turning into the same
           street. Driver has no choice, settling in behind the Lincoln.131 INT. NINO'S CAR/ 7TH STREET/ PACIFIC PALISADES - NIGHT. 131The chauffeur glances in his rear-view mirror and spots Driver's
           car for the first time. For now he doesn't give it much thought.
           In the back seat Nino finally says goodbye on the phone.NINO...Nice talking to you too...

           still on his tail. Just as a precaution he slows down, seeing if
           the pursuing car will overtake.134 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ ENTRADA DRIVE - NIGHT. 134Driver has to decide in an instant whether to take up the
           invitation. He overtakes the Lincoln, speeding ahead.135 INT. NINO'S CAR/ ENTRADA DRIVE/ PACIFIC PALISADES - NIGHT. 135Nino's chauffeur sees Driver's car disappear up ahead, relaxing
           now.136 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ WEST CHANNEL ROAD/ PCH - NIGHT. 136Driver puts his foot on the gas, taking sharp turns on small
           side streets, driving fast around the block until he's back on
           the Lincoln's tail, keeping a safe distance now.137 INT. NINO'S CAR/ W.CHANNEL RD./ PCH - NIGHT. 137Nino's chauffeur turns right into the Pacific Coast Highway.138 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 138Driver follows the Lincoln at a distance, keeping the winding
           corners of the PCH between himself and his prey.139 EXT. AERIAL VIEW/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 139From above we see Driver's car gliding along the open highway,
           the rising hills on one side, the churning ocean on the other,
           no vehicles in sight.140 INT. NINO'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 140In the back seat Nino dials another number on his cell-phone.NINO...Bernie, it's me...141 EXT. AERIAL VIEW/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 141The headlights of Driver's car sweep ahead of it on the open
           road. From above it looks like a shark closing in on its prey.142 INT. BERNIE ROSE'S APARTMENT/ LA - NIGHT. 142Bernie Rose stands by the window, listening to the phone in
           silence.789/24/10143 INT. NINO'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 143Nino sounds apologetic.NINO...Look, about that thing today...I'm

           The lights of the car behind have vanished.147 EXT. AERIAL VIEW/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 147Even from above we can't see Driver's car with its lights off -
           no idea how close it is to Nino's car.148 INT. BERNIE ROSE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT. 148Even though he's still angry, Bernie can't help forgiving his

           Suddenly blazing headlights explode to life behind him.150 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 150Driver rams the Lincoln at over a hundred miles an hour, hitting
           it just above the left rear wheel.151 EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 151The impact is momentous. The huge Continental is lifted up in
           the air and spun round at the same time. It slams back into the
           tarmac then flips end over end for a hundred yards.152 INT. BERNIE ROSE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT. 152Bernie Rose is left holding the phone as the line goes dead.153 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 153The collision has barely knocked Driver off course. His car
           skids to a stop near the overturned wreck.154 INT. NINO'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 154Among the carnage, we see Nino, bloodied but still alive. He
           unbuckles his seat belt and crawls out of the twisted wreck.155 EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 155Driver gets out of his car, calmly walking over to the
           pulverized Lincoln. He sees Nino stumbling off towards the beach
           but doesn't hurry after him yet. He checks to make sure the
           other passengers are dead, then heads on.156 EXT. BEACH/ OCEAN/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 156Nino stumbles through the sand, running for his life now. He
           looks behind him and sees Driver calmly pursuing him. He keeps
           running, but he's badly injured, slowing all the time. Fear
           clouds reason and he staggers towards the crashing waves.
                         
           Driver slows down as he watches the gangster wade into the
           ocean, a pathetic last attempt to evade him. The crashing waves
           and the undertow are an impenetrable wall. Every time Nino tries
           to wade out further, the ocean drags him back.(CONTINUED)809/24/10156 CONTINUED: 156Driver stares at his trapped prey. Nino's attempts become more
           and more feeble as the ocean exhausts him and snuffs out any
           hope of escape. Finally he retreats back into the shallow water,
           barely able to keep his footing. He turns around and faces
           Driver, the crashing waves still smashing into his back.
                         
           They stay like that for a moment. Gazing at each other. Driver
           silhouetted against the white sand. Nino trapped in the ocean.
           Then Driver wades out into the water. Nino has no fight left in
           him, staring at the masked man. Driver stares back at him then
           grabs him by the throat, forcing his head under the water. Nino
           splutters as Driver lets him up again.NINOIt was Bernie...Bernie Rose killed your
           friend not me...
                         
           Driver shoves his face back under the water, keeping it there
           until Nino's body finally stops thrashing.157 INT. BERNIE ROSE'S APARTMENT/ BEL AIR - NIGHT. 157A phone shrills. Bernie Rose answers it.BERNIE ROSENino?DRIVER'S VOICE ON THE PHONEHe's dead.
                         
           Bernie Rose stares out in silence. Whatever he thinks of Nino, a
           part of him has died. We feel the regret in his eyes but there's
           no trace of emotion in his voice.BERNIE ROSELooks like me, you and your girlfriend are
           the only pieces left on the board...158 EXT. BEACH/ OCEAN - NIGHT. 158Driver is no longer wearing a mask, framed against the ocean. He

           Bernie pauses, staring out.BERNIE'S VOICE ON THE PHONEI'll see you there at one.
                         
           A charged silence, then the line goes dead.159 OMITTED 159160 INT. GREAT WALL RESTAURANT/ LINCOLN BOULEVARD - DAY. 160A large Chinese restaurant. We follow Driver through the crowd.
           He sees Bernie Rose sitting at a table on his own, pouring
           himself a glass of wine. The mobster's dressed for the occasion,
           wearing a jacket and tie. He smiles at Driver as he sits down.BERNIE ROSECare for a glass?...
                         
           Driver doesn't smile, gazing back at him across the table.
           Bernie Rose doesn't seem to care.BERNIE ROSEI can recommend the duck. Hell, I can
           recommend everything -- Walnut prawns,
           shredded beef, Velvet chicken -- but the
           duck's to die for...
                         
           He delivers the last line with a pointed smile, then turns away,

           He waits for the waitress to leave, then turns back to Driver.BERNIE ROSEYou've been on a roll. Cut yourself quite a
           swath out there.(CONTINUED)829/24/10160 CONTINUED: 160DRIVERI never asked for any of it.BERNIE ROSEWe usually don't. But it comes down on our
           heads regardless. Look at Shannon...
                         
           Driver holds his gaze, the tension palpable, laughter and
           conversation drifting over from the other tables.BERNIE ROSEAnyway it's water under the bridge now.
           Question is where does that leave us?DRIVERThat's up to you.BERNIE ROSEYou bring the cash?
                         
           Driver nods. Bernie Rose studies him quietly.BERNIE ROSETell me something, how does someone with no
           interest in money get mixed up in a heist?
           (Off his silence)
           Shannon told me it was because of the girl?
                         
           Driver hesitates, betraying a hint of concern. Bernie sees it
           and smiles.BERNIE ROSEDon't worry. Nobody else knows about her.
           Just me...(A BEAT)You still see her?...DRIVERShe's not interested.BERNIE ROSEShe's got her head screwed on right. I got

           He smiles again, looking into Driver's eyes with just a hint of
           sympathy.BERNIE ROSEThis is what I'll do for you. You give me
           the money, nobody knows she exists. But

           He keeps staring at Driver, then smiles.BERNIE ROSEEither that or you choke on the duck...161 EXT. PARKING LOT/ LINCOLN BOULEVARD - DAY. 161Driver's car is parked at the back of the parking lot, half
           hidden by a fenced area for garbage. Driver pops the trunk,
           taking out the black gym bag with the cash. Bernie Rose doesn't
           even look at it, still admiring the car.BERNIE ROSEHow much does something like this cost?DRIVERNine, ten thousand. If you can find one

           Driver reaches out to give him the bag, when suddenly Bernie's
           hand snakes out of his pocket, twisting a switch-blade into
           Driver's gut. He pulls it out, ready to stab again, but this
           time Driver catches his wrist, slowly forcing the knife up to
           his throat.
                         
           Their eyes are fixed on each other for a moment, with something
           like regret, then the blade pierces Bernie Rose's neck, sinking
           deeper and deeper. Driver holds the old man in his arms as he
           dies. They stay like that, locked in a fatal embrace, then
           Driver lowers Bernie Rose gently to the ground, out of sight.
                         
           Blood seeping through his shirt, Driver picks up the gym bag and
           puts it back in the trunk, slamming the door shut.162 EXT. AERIAL VIEW OF A MUCH LARGER PARKING LOT/ LA - DAY. 162We're looking down on an enormous parking lot, hundreds of
           different colored vehicles gleaming down below. Driver pulls
           into the lot, searching for a place to park.163 EXT. LARGE PARKING LOT/ LA - DAY. 163Driver climbs out of his car, wearing a jacket over his blood-
           soaked shirt. He walks to the back of the car, kneels down, and
           hides the keys behind the left rear wheel, drops of blood
           dripping on the tarmac beneath him. He gets up again, then sets
           off through the maze of parked vehicles, dialling a number on
           his cell-phone.164 EXT. ECHO PARK - DAY. 164Irene and Benicio sit in the park.IRENE(Picking up her phone)

           Driver's skin looks deathly pale, his eyes a haunting shade of
           blue. He keeps walking through the maze of cars, casting his
           eyes from one vehicle to the next, looking for the perfect ride.DRIVERJust out of breath...

           Driver switches off his cell-phone reluctantly then heads
           towards the Camaro.166 INT. WHITE CAMARO/ LARGE PARKING LOT - DAY. 166Driver climbs into the front seat of the Camaro, catching his
           breath. He sits there a moment, sheltering from the world
           outside, then pulls out a pocket knife, opening the blades until
           he finds the screwdriver. He starts with the left side of the

           we CUT TO BLACK.
