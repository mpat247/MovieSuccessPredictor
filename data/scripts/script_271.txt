               industrial district. Even more important to establish than 
               the place is the time: end of summer, 1936. Election posters 
               would help, with the Republican ones stressing such themes 
               as "Burst the Roosevelt Bubble," "Save the American Way of 
               Life," "Vote for Landon and Knox."EXT. FACTORY - DAYOne of the most typical scenes of the day: a mass picket 
               line outside a textile or shoe factory. And the picketing is 
               anything but peaceful; the demonstrators are in direct 
               conflict with the police, who are trying to keep an entrance 
               open for strike-breakers. Whatever the general action, a 
               small segment of struggle breaks off from it, and it is this 
               that our CAMERA picks up: some police chasing some pickets 
               or some pickets chasing some strike-breakers, the one faction 
               pursuing the other up an alley with violent intent.EXT. ALLEY - DAYA couple of the pursuers catch up to the pursued and assault 
               them with clubs or other weapons. The fighting is bitter, 
               dirty and noisy.INT. KITCHEN IN SLEAZY RESTAURANT NEAR RAILROADThe eight men gathered here in a game of five-card stud are 
               clearly removed from the struggle outside, even though the 
               SOUNDS of it are very close, coming through window opening 
               on the alley. In fact the noise is so loud that the DEALER 
               of the hand in progress reacts in annoyance.DEALERSomebody shut the goddam window. Let 
                         a man think.

               The player nearest the window shuts it. The Dealer, who also 
               owns the restaurant, is the talkative type of poker player. 
               Except for THE CINCINNATI KID, the other men at the table 
               look like hoods of one sort or another: gunmen, labor spies, 
               extortionists, what have you. The man who fancies himself 
               the toughest of them all is named DANNY, and he and The Kid 
               have almost all the money on the table between them, about a 
               hundred dollars in front of each. No other player has more 
               than a few dollars left, and now, as fifth cards are dealt, 
               there is about forty dollars in the pot. Only four men are 
               left in the hand.DEALERPossible straight gets a --

                         He was dealing them high.

               Attending to first things first, The Kid has been pulling in 
               the pot, adding it to his own stake, and pocketing the total. 
               Now as Danny accuses him again, The Kid looks him squarely 
               in the face.DANNYYou stole that dough.KIDYou better watch those loose lips of

                         get greedy and try and buy the last 
                         hand.

               He walks off, disappearing through a door marked "MEN."INT. MEN'S ROOM - THE KID AT MIRRORHe is waiting when the door opens abruptly, and Danny appears, 
               his right hand in his coat pocket. The Kid's hand goes to 
               his own pocket and as he whirls around, a straight razor 
               appears in it, its blade snapped open. Pushing Danny to the 
               wall with one hand, he keeps him pinned there with the razor 
               in the other, while he bolts the door. Danny gets his right 
               hand out of the pocket with a gun in it, but The Kid moves 
               the razor blade against his neck.KIDDrop it.

               As the gun clatters to the floor, and the others force the 
               door, The Kid takes a step backward to provide enough 
               momentum, then swings at Danny's middle with his left, 
               dropping him, then jumps up on the wash basin and wriggles 
               his way out through a window.SUPERIMPOSE: MAIN TITLESDanny recovers his balance and his gun, unbolts the door 
               just before it is smashed in, and runs with the others to 
               get out of the building and after The Kid.EXT. ALLEY BACK OF RESTAURANT - DAYThe conflicting parties from the picket lines have moved on. 
               The Kid drops from the window to the ground and starts to 
               run toward the railroad yards. A few moments later, Danny 
               and four other poker players appear and run after him.EXT. RAILROAD YARDS - DAYThe chase across the tracks goes on behind the Credits. The 
               Kid's pursuers split into two groups to cut him off, and 
               they seem to have succeeded in cornering him against a track 
               on which a passenger train is bearing down, headed for the 
               station. His dubious chance of escape depends on his getting 
               beyond this track in front of the train, which, with a burst 
               of speed, he manages to accomplish just in time. The passenger 
               train divides The Kid from his pursuers, and we PAN with the 
               train into the depot.INT. UNION STATION, ST. LOUISThe train slowly stops. Amid all the atmosphere of arrival 
               in a day when the Pullman car was still the ultimate in 
               travel, LANCEY HODGES appears on a platform, takes his bag 
               from the Pullman porter and passes it on to a Red Cap before 
               he has descended the steps. He walks with other passengers 
               and Red Caps toward the center of the station.EXT. UNION STATION - DAYShooting through the Meeting of the Rivers fountain across

               into the river. Along the river bank can be seen a small 
               portion of the mile-long Hooverville that stretches up and 
               down the Mississippi.EXT. PIERThey walk out on the pier and eventually stop, look out at

               Shooter turns away abruptly as Christian arrives, giving her 
               a brief nod.SHOOTERSee you.

               The Kid takes Christian's arm automatically; he watches The 
               Shooter walk way down Harold Street. He and Christian head 
               in another direction. She is humming a mountain tune.CHRISTIANWhen we leaving town, Kid? This week?KIDNo, I won't be ready. Not for a while.CHRISTIANI thought --KIDMight even turn out we don't go.

                         than you did Saturday.

               He looks at her fondly and, for one fleeting moment of 
               weakness, is actually tempted to tell her about Lancey. But 
               it is too sharp a break with tradition.KIDYeah, I'm feeling a little different.(TIME LAPSE)INT. KID'S BEDROOMIt is night and the room is lit only by a single lamp where

               The Kid lies on his back under a sheet on the bed, his eyes 
               closed and his hands clasped tensely behind his neck. He 
               opens his eyes and turns to look at her. The movement catches 
               her eye, and she instantly stops turning the pages, afraid 
               the noise has disturbed him.KIDIt's all right. You don't have to

               She goes into the bathroom, where she turns the water on

                         of. I guess they know what went on 
                         but they care more about their safety

               awake because she is trying to persuade him to do what she

               for the game. He has chosen casual, comfortable clothes, and 
               now he collects three items to take with him: a large bottle 
               of mouthwash, a green sun-vizor, and finally, his stake. 
               When he withdraws the money from the dresser drawer, we can 
               see the pile has increased in size. The Kid finds an envelope 
               to put it in, and he is ready to go. He starts out but in 
               the middle of the kitchen he stops to look at his watch. It 
               is too early. He crosses to the stove, pours himself a cup 
               of coffee, and sits down to drink it.INT. LANCEY'S HOTEL ROOMLancey has decided on a change of costume from his last game, 
               and this time he goes for the old-fashioned velvet smoking 
               jacket and silk foulard. Over this he puts on a light 
               overcoat. Then he assembles medicines, toilet articles and 
               money, putting them all into a small satchel. Finally, he

               Lancey notices that most of the people around him have turned 
               to look at the doorway. He glances in the same direction in 
               a casual sort of way.FEATURING THE KIDHe saunters toward Lancey. Almost everyone greets him, and

               Hoban comes into the SHOT with a dispatch case, which he
