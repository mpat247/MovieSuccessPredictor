BODY OF EVIDENCEB O D Y   O F   E V I D E N C Eby Brad Mirman (second draft)--------------------------------------------------------------Over the BLACK we hear the SOUNDS of two people making love.  A
     MAN'S VOICE MOANS passionately.FADE IN:INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHTANDREW MARSH lies on his back in bed.  He is a frail-looking
     man in his early sixties, with thinning gray hair.  On top of
     him is a much younger WOMAN.  Although her back is to us, we
     catch flashes of her face for a moment as she turns from side
     to side.  We see enough to know that this is a beautiful woman.

     She moves wildly, grinding her hips into him, her head arched
     back, her hands rubbing lightly over her breasts.  She reaches
     down, grabbing his hips and jerks them upwards, forcing him
     deeper inside her.  They move together -- faster -- and faster.

     The CAMERA slowly begins to PULL BACK.  As it does we see what
     we are watching is on a TELEVISION.

     Further back still.  We see TWO UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICERS
     standing before the television watching the act.

     The CAMERA begins to pan around the room.  Rain streaks down
     the windows of the room -- LIGHTNING flashes outside.  A VIDEO
     CAMERA is set up on a tripod.  More PLAIN CLOTHES POLICE,
     looking, dusting, talking.

     We continue to PAN.  We can now see it is the same room on the
     tape.  ON the bed lies the naked body of ANDREW MARSH, a sheet
     covering his lower torso.  His face is ashen, mouth open, his
     dull eyes looking out in a fixed stare.  The last instant of
     his life is etched upon a face frozen in pain.EXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHTLIGHTNING fills the night sky.  THUNDER BOOMS overhead.  The
     wind whips the RAIN furiously against anything in its path.
     The CAMERA moves slowly along rows of beautiful HOMES.  At the
     end is a cul-de-sac.  Several POLICE CARS are in the driveway,
     their RED LIGHTS FLASHING.

     A four-door SEDAN pulls into the driveway.  JOHN CARDENAS steps
     out into the rain.  He is a handsome Latin in his thirties,
     with hard, chiseled features and black, slicked-backed hair.
     He does not run through the rain -- he walks.

     DETECTIVE REESE, a man who looks more like an accountant than a
     homicide detective runs out to meet him.2CARDENASIs it Marsh?REESEYeah.

     Just a hint of sadness shows on Cardenas' face.  It lasts an
     instant, then it's gone.REESESir, do you mind if we get out of the
               rain?

     Cardenas doesn't move.  He ignores the question.CARDENASWho found him?REESEHis Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.CARDENASShe was here?REESENo.  She stopped by to pick up some
               papers.CARDENASShow me.

     Reese starts for the house.  Cardenas looks up into the night
     sky.  A FLASH of LIGHTNING fills the SCREEN.INT.  HOUSE, BEDROOM - CLOSE ON CAMERA - NIGHTPull back to reveal a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER snapping pictures of
     Marsh in bed.

     Cardenas enters followed by Reese.  He moves through the
     FORENSIC and MEDICAL TEAMS.  Anything Cardenas feels about the
     gruesome sight before him is hidden behind a mask of
     indifference.

     Standing by the bed is ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY, ROGER
     TROXELL, a short, baby-faced man.  Cardenas looks down at the
     body, then over at the MEDICAL EXAMINER, DR. HENRY McCURDY, a
     portly man with windblown cheeks and bloodshot eyes.CARDENASHow long?3MCCURDYAbout three hours.CARDENASCause?MCCURDYNot sure.  I'll have everything you
               need tomorrow.REESETake a look at this.

     Reese points to the nightstand drawer and Troxell opens it.  On
     top of the nightstand is a box of tissues and a bottle of nasal
     spray.  Inside are ROPES, HANDCUFFS and an assortment of SEXUALAIDES.TROXELLThis guy was into some kinky shit.

     Cardenas looks at the various sexual devices, then walks out of
     the room.INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHTJOANNE BRASLOW sits on chair.  Her eyes are tired -- red from
     crying.  She is mid thirties -- attractive, but her looks come
     more from effort than nature -- expensive hair cut -- the right
     cosmetics.  She has a corporate look to her.

     Cardenas steps into the hall and walks over to her.CARDENASMiss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney
               John Cardenas.  You arrived at what
               time tonight?JOANNEA little after eleven.CARDENASWhy did you come by?JOANNEI had some papers to pick up.CARDENASDo you know who Mr. Marsh was with?JOANNEI assume his girlfriend.4CARDENASHer name?JOANNERebecca Lawson.CARDENASYou wouldn't know her address, would
                    you?JOANNENo -- but I can get it for you.CARDENASThank you.INT.  HALLWAY, CITY HALL BUILDING - DAYCardenas walks down the corridor with McCurdy.MCCURDYMarsh wasn't alone.  We found traces
                    of sperm on the sheets.  The
                    toxicology report says there were
                    high levels of cocaine in his blood.CARDENASWhat'd he die of?MCCURDYThe official cause of death was a
                    cardiac arrest.CARDENASThe official cause?MCCURDYThat's what my report will read.CARDENASBut there's more?

          They reach a door and stop.MCCURDYIt's speculative at this point.
                    Marsh had advanced Arterial disease.
                    His heart attack was induced by
                    excessive aerobic activity -- in
                    conjunction with the drug.

          McCurdy enters the room.  Cardenas thinks for a moment, then
          follows.5INT.  CARDENAS' OFFICE - DAYSpacious and sparsely furnished.  The walls are empty.  No
          commendations, plaques or photographs to add prestige to the
          office.  Cardenas steps into the room and looks at McCurdy who
          is already seated next to Reese and Troxell.CARDENAS(to McCurdy)
                    What are you saying, Henry?  That his
                    girlfriend fucked him to death?MCCURDYYes.

          A trace of a grin shows on Cardenas' face.  He walks over to
          the window and stares outside.  Reese, Troxell and McCurdy wait
          as he thinks.  A beat.  Cardenas turns back to the room.CARDENASWhat can we prove?MCCURDYWe know Marsh had a head cold.   We
                    found cocaine mixed with water in a
                    nasal spray container on the
                    nightstand.  The coke would contract
                    the nasal membrane the same as any
                    decongestant, but for a much shorter
                    time.  He'd keep using more and more
                    -- never knowing what he was taking.CARDENASAny prints on the nasal spray?REESEMarsh's and Rebecca Lawson's.TROXELLWhat if he did know what was in it?
                    A lot of users put it in nasal spray
                    bottles so they can use it in public.MCCURDYCocaine is the last thing a man in
                    his condition would want.CARDENASCan we put Rebecca Lawson at the
                    scene?6REESEA man across the street from Marsh
                    saw her drive up about four thirty
                    Sunday afternoon.  And her prints are
                    all over the place.

          Cardenas stands and walks to a DART BOARD on the wall.  He
          gathers the DARTS, moves back and tosses one.TROXELLMarsh's Cardiologist told me that
                    after Marsh was diagnosed with heart
                    disease he quit smoking, quit
                    drinking and started exercising every
                    day.  Does that sound like a guy
                    who'd start shoveling cocaine up his
                    nose?CARDENASWhat did he say about Miss Lawson?TROXELLHe can remember at least one occasion
                    -- and the receptionist can recall
                    two times when she accompanied Marsh
                    to the office.

          Cardenas throws another dart at the board.CARDENASSo she knew about his heart?TROXELLHad to.  I also interviewed three
                    women who were in past relationships
                    with Marsh.  There's no evidence that
                    he had anything but straight sex
                    prior to meeting Miss Lawson.CARDENASWhat about the will?TROXELLThat's the best part.  She gets it
                    all -- everything.EXT.  CEMETERY - MORNINGGray clouds hang over head.  A light drizzle falls.  A GROUP of
          MOURNERS hold umbrellas as they stand around the grave.

          In the b.g. the PRESS is visible, held back my private SECURITYGUARDS.7A WOMAN dressed in BLACK stands in the front of the MOUNERS,
          her face hidden behind a hat and veil.  RAYMOND SATTLER, a
          tall, distinguished-looking man in his sixties stands beside
          her.  He supports his weight with the aid of a CANE.  The
          service concludes.  Sattler along with several other PEOPLE
          offer her their condolences.  Joanne Braslow is there.  She
          does not go over to Rebecca.

          CARDENAS AND REESE stand off to the side by a large oak tree.
          Cardenas watches and waits.  He steps forward as Sattler leads
          the woman by.CARDENASMiss Lawson?

          The Woman stops.  Her back is to Cardenas.CARDENASI'm District Attorney, John Cardenas.

          REBECCA LAWSON removes her hat and veil and slowly turns
          around.  She is in her late twenties.  A deep pain fills her
          face -- controlled, but evident.  Her eyes are tired -- heavy
          from crying -- but no tears show now.  This is a woman whose
          grief is private and not displayed for others.  Although
          emotionally drained she is still stunningly beautiful.  So
          beautiful that even Cardenas' usually cool demeanor cannot hide
          how impressed he is.SATTLERI don't think that this is the time,
                    or the place.CARDENASI just wanted to introduce myself and
                    inform Miss Lawson that there will be
                    an inquiry.SATTLERAn inquiry into what?CARDENASFor starters I'd like to know why she
                    left the house and didn't report the
                    death?SATTLERBecause he wasn't dead when she left,
                    and even if he was, not reporting a
                    natural death in a timely fashion
                    isn't a crime.CARDENASDid I say it was a natural death?8Cardenas and Rebecca lock eyes.  Rebecca stares at him
          genuinely shocked by his accusation.  Cardenas nods and walks
          away.  In the b.g. we see Joanne staring at Rebecca with
          hostility.INT.  HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHTLarge and homey.  A fire roars in the fireplace.  FRANK DULANEY
          sits on his couch as he goes over some PAPERWORK.  He is mid-
          thirties, powerful, self-assured.

          SHARON DULANEY enters.  She is an attractive woman in her early
          thirties.  She kisses him on the cheek then pushes his
          PAPERWORK aside and sits down on his lap.SHARONYou're on vacation, remember?  You're
                    supposed to be relaxing.DULANEYI am relaxing.SHARON(pushing the papers
                          aside)
                    This is not relaxing.DULANEY(playfully)
                    Really?SHARONReally.DULANEY(playing along)
                    And I suppose you're going to show me
                    how to relax?SHARONIf you want me to.DULANEYI'm always open to learning new
                    things.

          She kisses him -- soft, gentle kisses.  Dulaney puts his arms
          around her and kisses her harder.DULANEYI'm beginning to see what you mean.
                    Why don't we go upstairs and work on
                    the advanced course?9SHARONI can't.  I've got to finish a
                    counter offer on the Bergman
                    property.

          The moment is passing by.  A trace of frustration shows on
          Dulaney's face -- this is obviously not a new occurrence.DULANEYCan't it wait?SHARONNo -- it has to be done by tomorrow.

          The moment is gone.  Dulaney forces an understanding smile.  He
          looks towards the door and sees his EIGHT YEAR OLD SON,MICHAEL.DULANEYHey, Slugger.  Ready for bed?

          Michael walks over to this parents.MICHAELUh huh.

          The PHONE RINGS.  Dulaney answers it.DULANEY(into phone)
                    Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?...
                    Well, I was sort of planning on...
                    Alright... Okay, goodbye.
                         (hangs up; to Sharon)
                    That was Sattler.  He thinks the
                    D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca
                    Lawson.  He wants me in the office
                    tomorrow morning.SHARONWe're supposed to go to the lake.DULANEYI know.  What can I do?  He is the
                    boss.SHARONHe could let you have your vacation.MICHAELDad -- is it true what they're saying
                    about that Miss Lawson Lady?10DULANEYWhat are they saying?MICHAELThe kids at school say she humped Mr.
                    Marsh to death.DULANEYHey, you know better than that.  What
                    did I teach you to say when someone
                    is accused of doing something?MICHAELShe allegedly humped him to death?

          Dulaney grins.  Sharon is fighting the temptation to laugh.SHARONI swear -- the both of you.
                         (to Dulaney)
                    Some example you set.DULANEY(imitating her)
                    Some example you set.

          He makes a funny face at Michael who LAUGHS and makes one back.
          Dulaney grabs him and starts TICKLING him.  Michael SCREAMS
          with LAUGHTER as he tries to tickle him back.  Dulaney then
          starts TICKLING SHARON -- Michael helps him.  Sharon ROARS with
          LAUGHTER and falls to the floor.  The three of them roll around
          LAUGHING hysterically.INT.  SATTLER'S OFFICE - MORNINGSattler sits on a couch sipping a cup of coffee.  Dulaney sits
          across from him.DULANEYAndrew Marsh was a very wealthy man.
                    A trial like this is going to put
                    Cardenas in the spot-light.SATTLERWe've already got press arriving from
                    over the country and she hasn't even
                    been charged yet.
                    Cardenas wants to see her in his
                    office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you
                    to go with her.DULANEYI'm supposed to be on vacation.11SATTLERI know -- but she wants you to
                    represent her if Cardenas files.DULANEYWhy?SATTLERBecause I told her you were the best
                    criminal attorney we have.DULANEYRaymond, I'm the only criminal
                    attorney you have.SATTLER(jokingly)
                    Well, I guess that makes you the
                    best.

                    Look, Frank -- she stands to inherit
                    three million dollars.  As executors
                    of the estate and her attorneys that
                    could generate a lot of legal fees
                    for us.  All I'm asking you to do is
                    talk to her.

          Dulaney thinks about it for a moment.DULANEYAlright, I'll talk to herSATTLERShe's waiting in the conference room.

          Dulaney stands and walks towards the door.SATTLER(continuing)
                    You know, I knew Andrew Marsh for
                    almost twenty years -- or thought I
                    did.  What do you think would make a
                    man in his condition do the things he
                    did?

          Dulaney stops at the door and looks back.DULANEYI think the question is:  What is it
                    about her that made him want to do
                    it?12INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - DAYRebecca is seated at the end of the conference table smoking a
          CIGARETTE.  Sunlight flows through a window and highlights her
          hair.  She is dressed in a fashionable business suit that
          clings to every curve of her body.

          Dulaney enters the room.  When he sees her he can't help but
          stare.  Rebecca notes his gaze.DULANEYMiss Lawson, I'm Frank Dulaney.

          She raises the cigarette to her lips.  Dulaney notices despite
          her outward composure her hand is shaking.REBECCA(nervously)
                    Are you going to represent me?DULANEYThere are no charges against you. I'm
                    here to decide if I'm going to

                    Did you kill him?

          Rebecca appears hurt by the question.REBECCAYou don't waste any time, do you?

          Dulaney doesn't answer.  He studies her -- his eyes probing
          hers.REBECCA(continuing)
                    Do you think I did it?DULANEYI don't know.  That's why I'm asking
                    you.REBECCAYou must have some feeling.  Some
                    immediate impression.  A young,
                    attractive woman, involved with an
                    older man who leaves her everything
                    in his will.  And the things that
                    went on in that house.  Such wild
                    sex.  What kind of picture does that
                    paint?DULANEYNot a very good one I'm afraid.13REBECCAAnd that's exactly what the jury will
                    see when they look at me.  That's why
                    I need a very good lawyer, Mr.
                    Dulaney.DULANEYYou're assuming the District Attorney
                    is going to file charges.

          Rebecca's anxiety begins to surface.  She feigns a weak smile.REBECCAHe'll file.  He's an ambitious man.
                    Ambitious men build their careers on
                    the bodies of others.DULANEYYou still haven't answered my
                    question.

          She takes a long drag of her cigarette before answering.  She
          looks at Dulaney.  Displaying emotions is not something that
          comes easily.  Tears well up in her eyes.REBECCA(emotionally)
                    I loved him.  A big part of my life
                    has been torn away from me, Mr.
                    Dulaney.  A part I can never get back
                    -- and on top of that people are
                    saying that I am somehow responsible
                    for it.  They've taken everything
                    that is good and caring about two

                    condition?REBECCANo.CARDENASMr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his
                    nurse have told us that you
                    accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office
                    on at least two occasions.REBECCAThat's correct -- but Andrew never
                    told me he had a heart condition.  He
                    said he had a heart arrhythmia and it
                    was nothing serious.REESEHe never mentioned his heart disease?17DULANEYShe just said that.REESEWhy do you think he lied to you?DULANEYThat's something only Marsh would
                    know.REESEI think Miss Lawson knew it too.  I
                    think she slipped him the coke and he
                    popped his cork giving her the high-
                    hard-one.

          Dulaney's anger shows.  He stands.DULANEYThat's it.  My client doesn't have to
                    take this crap from you.CARDENASSit down, Frank.DULANEYNo.  Miss Lawson came in here
                    voluntarily to answer your questions.
                    She doesn't have to sit here and be
                    insulted.  So, either you charge her
                    now or we're leaving.

          A beat.  Dulaney and Cardenas lock eyes.  Cardenas shrugs his
          shoulders.CARDENASFine.

          Dulaney motions for Rebecca to get up.  She stands and they
          walk to the door.  Reese looks at Cardenas.  Cardenas nods.REESERebecca Lawson, you're under arrest
                    for the murder of Andrew Marsh.

          Rebecca is stunned -- frightened.  She looks at Dulaney in
          disbelief.  Dulaney looks at Cardenas angrily.  Reese removes
          his handcuffs as he moves towards Rebecca.REESEYou have the right to remain silent.

                    I don't think the handcuffs will be
                    necessary.  You can finish giving
                    Miss Lawson her rights outside.

          Reese grabs Rebecca by the arm and leads her to the door.  She
          looks back at Frank, her face filled with fear -- her eyes
          welling with tears.REBECCA(frightened)
                    Frank!DULANEYI'll have you out in a few hours.

          Reese ushers her through the door.  A beat.  Dulaney and
          Cardenas are left alone.  Cardenas starts fishing through a can
          of NUTS, carefully extracting the cashews.  Dulaney continues
          to stand.DULANEYLookin' to make the papers, John?CARDENASMarsh left her close to three million
                    dollars in his will.  That's motive.
                    She admits to being there the night
                    of his death.  That's opportunity --
                    and her fingerprints are on the nasal
                    spray bottle.DULANEY(continuing)
                    You can't show intent.

          Cardenas looks at Dulaney wryly.  He knows that Dulaney is
          trying to discover his game plan.  Cardenas looks into his can
          of nuts and fishes for another cashew.DULANEY(continuing)
                    Can you?CARDENASTake your pole out of the water,
                    Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.DULANEYYou're bluffing.  John, it's me,
                    remember?  I've known you since your
                    name was Juan Carlos.

          Cardenas doesn't appreciate Dulaney mentioning his real name.19DULANEY(continuing)
                    C'mon -- think about it.  If she was
                    going to kill Marsh why leave the
                    nasal spray bottle there for the
                    police to find?CARDENASShe planned this.  She wanted us to
                    find the nasal spray.DULANEYWhy would she want that?CARDENASBecause she's clever.  Because she
                    knows that even if we didn't find it
                    we'd have suspicions as to why a man
                    in Marsh's condition would use
                    cocaine.DULANEYSuspicions maybe -- but suspicions
                    aren't enough for a conviction.CARDENASThe M.E.'s report stated that Marsh's
                    nasal membranes showed no sign of
                    prior cocaine use.  Without the nasal
                    spray we would have still treated it
                    as a poisoning.  We would have looked
                    for motive and the trail would have
                    still led back to her.DULANEYI don't buy it and neither will a
                    jury.CARDENASWe're going all the way on this one,
                    Frank.  Tell your client she has
                    until the prelim to cop a plea for
                    murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.DULANEYI'll tell her but she won't take it.CARDENASThen she's not as smart as I thought
                    she was.  You've seen her in the
                    depositions.  Tell me you don't have
                    any doubts?20DULANEYShe's innocent.CARDENASAren't they all?DULANEYYeah.  Well -- we'll let the
                    blindfolded lady with the scales
                    decide that.

          Dulaney gets up slowly and leaves.INT.  CITY JAIL, BOOKING COUNTER - AFTERNOONDulaney waits at the counter.  A barred door slides open and
          Rebecca is led out by a WOMAN JAILER.  Even in these
          surroundings she maintains her composure.  She walks to the
          counter and waits silently.EXT.  CITY HALL BUILDING - AFTERNOONAs Dulaney and Rebecca leave they are once again encircled by
          REPORTERS, screaming questions, asking them to verify Rebecca's
          arrest.  Dulaney plows through the crowd with Rebecca in tow.EXT.  RIVER - AFTERNOONGray clouds hang overhead, threatening rain.  Tall birch trees
          line the river, the color of their leaves hinting that autumn
          is approaching.  Dulaney and Rebecca walk along a jogging path
          cut along the bank.DULANEYI want you to know right now that the
                    trial's going to be nasty.  Your sex
                    life is going to be dragged through
                    the mud.  They're going to say that
                    you enticed Marsh -- led him down a
                    dark path.REBECCAAndrew hardly needed leading.  He was
                    a very passionate man.  He was eager
                    to explore.  I gave him what he
                    wanted.  We fulfilled each others
                    needs.DULANEYThis is a very small town -- people
                    here have very straight views on sex.21REBECCAI'm used to being on the outside
                    looking in.  The same men who will
                    publicly profess their moral outrage
                    for my sexual tastes are the same
                    ones who privately rest their sweaty
                    little hands on my legs and talk
                    about weekend trips together.DULANEYThose same men will be sitting on the
                    jury.REBECCAI am who I am.  I can't deny it,
                    anymore than you can deny who you
                    are.  I like sex different -- I like
                    it wild.  That's not a crime.
                         (emotional)
                    I loved Andrew.  We made love
                    together.  We made it differently,
                    but we still made love.  It was our
                    way.  It was private -- and now the
                    whole world wants to look in through
                    the pretense of justice.  If I was
                    some middle-aged divorcee who screwed
                    him once a week do you think this
                    would be happening to me?

          She stops walking and stares out over the River.REBECCAHave you ever seen animals make love,
                    Mr. Dulaney?  They have such passion
                    -- such savage emotion.  They
                    struggle, and snarl, and claw, but
                    neither hurts the other.  Not really.DULANEYNo pain, no gain?REBECCASomething like that.DULANEYWe're not animals.

          As Rebecca speaks, Dulaney seems captivated.22REBECCAOf course we are.  Our primal urges
                    are still there -- but we've taken
                    sex and intellectualized it, refined
                    it down to its most essential
                    components.  It's bland, easy,
                    mechanical.  There's great passion in
                    the struggle -- such craving in
                    denial.  Do you know what it's like
                    to yearn for something?  I'm not
                    talking about wanting, or needing.
                    I'm talking about an urge so deep
                    that your skin burns and every cell
                    in your body pulses with desire?

          Dulaney appears moved by the passion of her words -- but he's
          uncomfortable by it and quickly pushes it aside.DULANEY(awkwardly)
                    I think we're getting a little off
                    the subject here.REBECCAI thought the subject was sex?DULANEYAs it pertains to you -- not me.

                    explain to you.DULANEYWhy not?REBECCABecause -- it's beyond intellect.
                    It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has
                    to be experienced -- it can't be
                    imagined.DULANEYTry.

          Rebecca thinks for a moment.23REBECCAWhen I was growing up we had a
                    strawberry patch in our backyard. So
                    did this family down the road.  I
                    used to sneak in their yard and steal
                    their strawberries.  It wasn't easy.
                    The stone walls were high and I'd
                    scrape my knees as I climbed over.
                    On the other side were wild rose
                    bushes.  The thorns would dig into my
                    legs and cut my thighs as I lowered
                    myself down.DULANEYIf you had what you wanted at home
                    why did you sneak into their yard?REBECCABecause -- somehow the fruit always
                    tasted that much sweeter because of
                    the pain it took to get to it.

          with Rebecca.  She removes a CIGARETTE and holds it, waiting

          and removes a book of MATCHES.  He lights one.  Rebecca doesn't
          lean forward to meet him.  He must go to her.  She looks into
          his eyes as she cups her hand over his.  A beat.  She lights
          the cigarette and takes a drag, then arches her neck back and
          blows a stream of smoke towards the ceiling.  SHE DOES NOT BLOW
          OUT THE MATCH OR REMOVE HER HAND FROM DULANEY'S.  She watches

          hand.DULANEYHow'd you meet Marsh?REBECCAI was at a cocktail party.  Very

          of the cabinet is a WHITE PERSIAN CAT.REBECCAThere you are.

          She stands on her tip toes as she reaches up.  Dulaney watches
          her -- the arch of her back -- the hem of her skirt rising up
          her legs.  She lowers the cat down and walks to a chair and
          sits down.  The slit of her dress opens revealing her thighs.
          Dulaney's eyes trace along them.  Rebecca notes his gaze.30REBECCAWhat are you thinking?

          The fact that he doesn't protest confirms that she is right.
          She runs her finger lightly along her thighs.REBECCAI am.

          Dulaney walks to the window and stares out.  Rebecca seems
          amused.  She puts the cat down and walks over to him.REBECCASorry.  I wasn't trying to embarrass

          Dulaney sits across from Sharon.  His eyes are on the
          strawberries.  His mind is someplace else -- and it isn't hard
          to guess where.SHARON--he said it might be too expensive

                    yourself to a drink.

          She disappears down the hall.  Dulaney stands were he is,
          wondering what he is doing there.  He walks over to the BAR and
          pours a SCOTCH.  He looks down the hall.HIS POV - REBECCA'S BEDROOMThe bedroom door is open.  The room is DARK -- Lit only by the
          moon.  Rebecca slowly pulls her sweater off over her head.
          MOONLIGHT washes over her body, SILHOUETTING her.  She runs her
          hands lightly over her stomach -- working her way up to her
          round, full breasts.  She stops for a moment -- and we sense
          she knows Dulaney is watching her.

          Dulaney stares at her -- mesmerized.  He knows he should turn
          away, but he cannot control the urge that moves him to look.

          One by one Rebecca unsnaps the buttons of her jeans, revealing
          her sheer, white panties.  She bends forward slightly and
          slowly peels the jeans down to her ankles -- then steps out of
          them.

          We can see the desire on Dulaney's face.  He looks away.  The
          conflict inside him grows.  He looks back.

          Rebecca walks into the hall.  She is barefoot --  wearing a
          long, slinky dress -- her eyes catch Dulaney's.  If she wasn't
          aware he was watching her before -- she is now.  It doesn't
          seem to bother her.  She moves towards him slowly -- her eyes
          inviting his.

          Dulaney moves towards her.  They meet in the middle of the
          room.  She waits -- he moves closer -- so close that he can
          smell her.  She cranes her neck back, subtly tempting him to
          bring his lips to hers.  The longing overcomes him.  He kisses
          her lightly -- the kiss lingers for a moment, then she grabs
          him forcefully by the hair, arching his head back.  She bites
          his lip.36REBECCA(whispering)
                    My way.

          Dulaney ignores her.  He tries to kiss her again.  She turns
          her head away.

          She walks down the hall into the bedroom and closes the door.
          Dulaney follows.  He tries the door -- it's locked.  He starts
          to knock -- stops -- turns and walks back into the living room.
          He starts to leave -- stops.  He looks at the bedroom door.
          His passion builds -- his hunger for her devours him.  He moves
          quickly down the hall -- eyes filled with determination.  He
          breaks the door open with his shoulder.

          Rebecca is standing in the center of the room -- as if waiting
          for him.  He moves to her.  She can see the fire in his eyes.
          He takes her in his arms -- kisses her neck feverishly --
          feeding his craving for her.REBECCAMy way.

          He is lost within her now and doesn't hear her.  She pulls his
          hair, jerking his head back.  Her eyes command him to follow
          her demand.

          Something in him snaps -- a new door opens.  He pushes her back
          onto the DRESSING CABINET.  He kisses her, running his hand up
          her thighs, hiking up her dress.  She wraps her legs around his
          waist.  They move along the cabinet -- knocking jars and
          bottles to the floor.  He lifts her -- carries her to the bed -
          - lays her down and rips her dress from her body.  Their
          passion is unleased.  They grope and claw for one another
          hungrily.  She pulls his shirt off and bites him on the
          shoulder.  His face tenses from the pain, but he MOANS with

                    along.DULANEYWhat changed?JOANNEHe did.  Look, I know you can lead a
                    horse to water but you can't make him

                    district attorney is saying about
                    Miss Lawson, do you?JOANNEI don't know.  It's incredible to
                    think that anyone could be capable of
                    doing that -- but if anyone could it
                    would be Rebecca.DULANEYI take it you don't like Miss Lawson
                    very much?JOANNEI really don't know her that well.
                    We would say hello to each other when
                    I would come to the house, but that
                    was about it.DULANEYIf you don't know her that well what
                    makes you think she's capable of

                    he was thirty years older than her.
                    Where's the attraction to sleep with
                    someone like that -- to have the kind
                    of sex they had.39DULANEYHow do you know what kind of sex they
                    had?JOANNEI wasn't lookin' through the keyhole
                    if that's what you're thinking.  I'd
                    come to house sometimes to pick up
                    papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find

          Dulaney is shocked by this.DULANEYHow do you know that?JOANNEI was at the house one morning -- I
                    thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with
                    Mr. Marsh.  When I went into the
                    guest bathroom she was standing in
                    front of the mirror pouring this
                    white powder out of a vial.

                    your time.

          JUDGE BURNHAM, a confident BLACK MAN in his fifties sits behind
          the bench.  He is strong-willed -- tough but fair.  There is a
          rough edge to him from his childhood on the streets.JUDGE BURNHAMThis trial by its very nature is
                    explosive.  The press is going to
                    have a field day and I will not

                    into very personal aspects of peoples

                    line of relevancy early on in your

                    You all can see the defendant,
                    Rebecca Lawson.  But as this trial
                    proceeds you will see that she is not
                    only the defendant -- she is the
                    murder weapon itself.43(stops and thinks for
                          a moment)
                    Is that possible?  Can a person
                    actually be a weapon?  The answer is
                    yes.  If I hit you and you die -- I
                    am the cause of your death.  But can
                    sex be called a weapon?  Yes.  And
                    what a deadly weapon Rebecca Lawson
                    made of it.  The State will prove
                    that Miss Lawson seduced Andrew Marsh
                    -- that she put increasing sexual
                    demands on him while she secretly
                    administered cocaine.  All the while
                    knowing that he had a severe heart

                    She is a beautiful woman -- but when
                    this trial is over you will see her
                    no differently than a gun, or a knife
                    or any other instrument used as a
                    weapon.  She is a killer.  And the
                    worst kind -- one who disguised
                    herself as a loving partner.

          Cardenas walks back to the prosecution table and sits down.JUDGE BURNHAMMr. Dulaney?

          Dulaney stands up and approaches the jury.DULANEYI know what you're thinking -- and
                    it's a mistake.  You look at Miss
                    Lawson and you see a beautiful woman
                    who was involved with an older man --
                    and you think she looks like the
                    type.  She could've done it.  And
                    that's exactly what the District
                    Attorney wants you to think.  Yes,
                    she is beautiful.  So what?  Does
                    that make her a killer?  Of course
                    not.  This case is not about
                    appearances.  It's about facts.

                    As Mr. Cardenas presents his case you
                    will see that there are very few
                    facts -- that the bulk of the States
                    evidence is circumstantial.  I'm
                    confident that by the conclusion of
                    this trial you will not just have a
                    reasonable doubt.  You will have no
                    doubt at all --  that Rebecca Lawson
                    is innocent of the charges against

                    condition prior to his death?MCCURDYVery poor.  He was suffering from
                    severe arterial disease.CARDENASWas the heart attack the result of
                    natural causes?MCCURDYNo.CARDENASWhat induced it?MCCURDYWe found a high concentration of
                    cocaine in his blood.CARDENASSo, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?MCCURDYI don't think so.  The membrane in
                    his nasal passage didn't show any
                    sign of long time usage.CARDENASThen how did it get into his body?MCCURDYWe found a bottle of Dristan nasal
                    spray on the nightstand.  It was
                    filled with water and cocaine.  Mr.
                    Marsh had a head cold at the time of
                    his death.  I believe he wasn't aware
                    that he was ingesting cocaine.45Cardenas holds up a bottle of NASAL SPRAY in a PLASTIC BAG.  He

                    someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?MCCURDYIncrease his heart rate.CARDENAS-- And if he were in the midst of
                    making love while under the influence
                    of cocaine?MCCURDYIt would be an added stress to his
                    heart.CARDENASWhat would be the effect if someone
                    secretly administered cocaine to Mr.
                    Marsh and then induced him to make
                    love?MCCURDYIt would be the same as shooting a

                    Mr. Marsh didn't ingest the cocaine
                    himself?MCCURDYNo -- but it seems highly unlikely
                    that a man in his condition would use
                    cocaine.DULANEYThat's your opinion, Doctor -- but

                    the uncertainty of her leaving was
                    driving him crazy and if it didn't
                    stop it was going to kill him.  That
                    if she did leave his heart couldn't
                    take it.

          sigh of relief.INT.  UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOONQuiet and desolate -- most of the city employees have left for

          Rebecca presses against him, raising her knee gently into his
          groin -- as she kisses him passionately.  Dulaney is lost in
          her kiss for a moment, then breaks it off and looks around.

          Rebecca smiles -- takes off her shoes and stands on the hood of
          her car.  She takes one of the shoes and hits the PARKING LOT
          OVERHEAD LIGHT FIXTURE.  The BULB breaks sending the area in
          darkness.DULANEYWhat are you doing?

          resist.REBECCAI want you inside me.

          and unbuttons his pants.INT.  REBECCA'S BEDROOM - NIGHTThe room is dimly lit.  Dulaney is in bed.  He appears to be
          deep in thought.  Rebecca enters wearing a sheer, silk bathrobe

          The question hurts Rebecca -- it shows on her face.  She looks
          away from him.  A beat.  Dulaney thinks.  He feels bad for
          asking such a question.DULANEYI'm sorry.

          She lifts a PLASTIC BOTTLE of HONEY and starts to pour it into
          a cup.  She stops and smiles seductively at Dulaney, then parts
          her bathrobe and slowly draws a liquid line with it along her
          thigh.  She reaches out -- grabs him by the hair and gently
          pulls him forward.  He kisses her knee and slowly runs his
          tongue along her thigh, following the trail upwards.  She
          arches her back -- closes her eyes -- breathes deeply from the
          pleasure of his touch.INT.  DULANEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHTDark.  The door opens -- light from the hall streaks into the

                    months ago.CARDENASDid you ever see her again after
                    that?DR. PALEYYes -- several times.CARDENASWhat eventually happened to your
                    relationship with Miss Lawson?DR. PALEYWe stopped seeing each other.CARDENASWhy?DR. PALEYWell -- I realized that she wasn't
                    interested in me.  She was just
                    trying to get information out of me.54CARDENASWhat kind of information?DR. PALEYShe said that she was working on a
                    novel and she wanted to know what
                    kinds of drugs would be harmful to
                    someone with a bad heart.

          WHISPERS from the crowd fill the room.CARDENASDid you suggest any?DR. PALEYYes -- Insulin and others.CARDENASWhat did she say?DR. PALEYShe said that those weren't any good
                    -- because their use would be
                    detected and the police would know
                    the victim had been poisoned.  She
                    wanted to know if there was a drug
                    that would induce a heart attack but
                    could also be used to enhance a
                    sexual high.CARDENAS-- And what did you suggest?DR. PALEYCocaine.

                    her?DR. PALEYNo.DULANEYIf necessary I can bring in the valet
                    parking attendant and two customers
                    who witnessed the occurrence.

          Paley thinks for a moment.  He is nervous.DR. PALEYWell -- as I remember it, we had an
                    argument.DULANEYAnd the argument was about the fact
                    that you wanted to be romantically
                    involved and she did not.DR. PALEY(hesitantly)

          Dulaney walks back to his desk and removes a TAPE PLAYER from a
          cardboard box.DULANEYYour Honor, this is a tape from Miss

                    -- or under what circumstances it was
                    made.56Dulaney takes out two pieces of PAPER and approaches the bench.DULANEYThese are reports from two
                    independent audio labs.  They each
                    state that the voices were recorded
                    over the phone and that no

          Dulaney stops the machine.  He takes a dramatic pause, letting
          the words on the tape sink in.

          Cardenas is dismayed and tries to hide his frustration.
          Dulaney approaches Paley who is now very nervous.DULANEY(quoting)
                    You'll be sorry?DR. PALEYI was angry.DULANEYYou're still angry, aren't you?
                    Isn't it true that your whole story
                    is nothing more than a vindictive
                    attempt on your behalf to get back at

          over him in a sexy silk ROBE.  Dulaney starts to sit up but

          chest.  Dulaney follows it with his eyes.  Rebecca picks up a
          LARGE CANDLE on the nightstand and moves it slowly -- back and
          forth over his chest.DULANEYWhat are you going you doing?REBECCAAre you scared?

          He doesn't answer.  He doesn't have to.  She can see the fear
          in his eyes.  She tilts the candle -- a stream of WAX pours out
          on his chest.  Dulaney winces with pain, his body arching on
          the bed, his hands straining against his restraints.

          She smiles -- a wicked smile, then pours more wax, making a
          thin trail of LITTLE BEADS that moves down his chest towards
          his stomach.  Dulaney's face cringes.  He stares at her through
          eyes filled with fear.REBECCA(whispering)
                    I love you, Frank.  I love your
                    strength -- be strong for me now.

          navel and working her way towards his groin.DULANEY(pleading)

          Rebecca stares at him warmly -- fondly.REBECCAI told you in the beginning that it
                    was my way.  My way can be many
                    things -- pleasure or pain.

          She lifts a bottle of white vinegar and holds it over his burn.
          He tenses as she pours it on his chest.  -- then relaxes when
          he realizes it's water.  He breathes a SIGH of relief.REBECCAYou see how life is, Frank?  We judge
                    things.  We look at things from the
                    outside and assume we know what's on
                    the inside.

          She takes a sip from the bottle.59REBECCAWater.  But you assumed it was
                    vinegar -- because you were only
                    looking at the outside.

          Her meaning isn't lost on Dulaney.  She watches him -- as if
          studying him -- then slowly -- very slowly,  she pulls on the
          belt of her ROBE.  The robe parts revealing the beauty of her
          body.  She gently lowers herself on top of him -- pressing her
          breasts against him.  Dulaney's breathing quickens in
          excitement.  Rebecca moves her head to his chest -- kissing his
          burns softly while her fingers caress lightly over his stomach.
          She gradually moves her head down -- lower -- and lower.CLOSE ON DULANEYhe stares at the ceiling -- his mind a maze of confusion.  Soon
          the power of her touch fills him -- overpowering him.  His eyes
          close.  The pain that only moments ago filled his body is
          replaced with pleasure.INT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE - NIGHTIt's late.  Dulaney enters quietly and heads for the stairs.  A

                    her.CARDENASDid they argue the day before he
                    died?ESTERWell -- he died on a Sunday and I

          desk.  Dulaney and Cardenas stand before him.64JUDGE BURNHAMMr. Dulaney, before you cast
                    aspersions on the District Attorney's
                    Office by suggesting they've coaxed
                    this witness to say things that
                    aren't true -- you better have more
                    than a hunch.  Do you?DULANEYNo, Your Honor.JUDGE BURNHAMMaybe you don't know what it's like
                    where Mrs. Crawford comes from -- but
                    I do.  I came from a neighborhood
                    just like hers.  This is a whole
                    other world for her.  She's a poor
                    working woman who has been thrust
                    into a room full of highly educated
                    and mostly unsympathetic people.  So,
                    she puts on her best dress, fixes her
                    hair and tries to present herself as
                    intelligently as possible.
                         (beat)
                    Being poor and having pride is not a
                    crime, Mr. Dulaney -- and before you
                    attempt to impeach another witness'
                    testimony in my courtroom -- your
                    foundations better be based on
                    something other than semantics.EXT.  COURTHOUSE - AFTERNOONDulaney walks down the steps.  Cardenas joins him.CARDENASI'm surprised you can walk after the
                    way Burnham chewed your ass out this
                    afternoon.

          Cardenas grins.  His comment was meant as a friendly jab
          between old friends.  Dulaney doesn't see it that way.DULANEY(coldly)
                    I've got work to do.CARDENASHey -- the bell's sounded.  It's
                    between rounds.DULANEYI didn't hear it.65CARDENASWhat's happening to you, Frank?
                    You're acting like you're on trial
                    here.  This has become personal to
                    you.DULANEYBack off, John.

          Cardenas studies him for a moment.CARDENASYou're sleeping with her, aren't you?

          Dulaney forces a laugh.  It's not a very convincing one.DULANEYThat's ridiculous.CARDENASI'm talking to you as a friend now.
                    Don't ruin your life, your career for
                    her.  She'll spit you out when this
                    is over.DULANEYYou don't know what you're talking
                    about.CARDENASReally?  What does an attorney speak
                    to his client about at her house
                    until three o'clock in the morning?DULANEYYou've been following me?CARDENASHer.  It's an obvious move.  I'm
                    building a case against her,
                    remember?

          Something in Dulaney snaps.  He grabs Cardenas and pushes him
          up against the wall.  Cardenas pushes back.CARDENASIf your head wasn't up your ass you
                    would have thought of it too.  You're
                    losing perspective.  Get out while
                    you can -- before she takes you down
                    with her.66INT.  HALLWAY - AFTERNOONDulaney walks towards his office.  Biggs walks quickly down the
          hall and joins him.BIGGSI've been waiting for you to get
                    back.DULANEYYou got something on the coke?BIGGSNo -- but I got something.

          Biggs steps into Dulaney's office.  Dulaney follows.INT.  DULANEY'S OFFICE - MORNINGBiggs picks up a remote control off the desk and sits on the
          couch.  Dulaney sits at his desk.BIGGSDuring lunch I was watching some of
                    Marsh's home videos.

          Biggs clicks the control.  On the TV we see Rebecca on top of
          Marsh in the bedroom.BIGGSHe was really into recording this
                    stuff.  The D.A.'s office found a box
                    full of tapes.

          Watching Rebecca with Marsh bothers Dulaney.BIGGSThis girl has really got some moves,
                    huh?

          Dulaney stands up and turns off the television.DULANEYIf you want to get your kicks go to a
                    video store and rent a porno movie.

          Biggs studies Dulaney for a moment.  Dulaney's reaction bothers
          him.  He turns the TV back on and fast forwards the tape.  The
          screen turns to SNOW where the tape has been recorded over.BIGGSThis tape was recorded over an
                    existing recording.67DULANEYOver what?

          Biggs raises a hand signaling patience.  SNOW still fills the
          TV screen.BIGGSI would have missed it -- but the
                    phone rang and I let it play while I
                    talked.  It looks like blank tape --
                    but it isn't.  It's been erased
                    without any input signal coming in.DULANEYSo, what good is it to us if it's
                    been erased?BIGGSIt's very good -- because when the
                    D.A's office saw it they assumed it
                    was the end of the tape, otherwise
                    they would have buried it.DULANEYWhy?BIGGSBecause it hasn't all been erased.

          Biggs looks at the screen.  A beat.  The SNOW dissolves and a
          picture fades in.  The PICTURE LASTS only about five seconds.
          We see Rebecca from the back as she straddles Marsh, grinding
          up and down on the bed -- her hair flowing down her back.
          Marsh raises his hand.  His WRIST IS IN A CAST.  She turns her
          head to the side and as she does we see that it is not Rebecca
          -- but Joanne Braslow.  The Tape clicks off.

          Dulaney stares at the blank screen.DULANEY(quoting Joanne)
                    Where's the attraction to sleep with
                    someone like that.EXT.  PARKING LOT - DUSKJoanne Braslow walks to her BMW 325i.  She is about to open the
          door when Dulaney approaches her.DULANEYI need to speak with you.68JOANNEI don't think we have anything more
                    to talk about, Mr. Dulaney.

          She starts to get in the car.DULANEYYou were sleeping with Marsh.

          She stops -- appears shocked that he knows this.  There is now
          a different quality to her -- an edge.JOANNEWho told you that?DULANEYHe video taped you.JOANNEThat bastard!DULANEYI thought he was a kind, gentle man?

          Joanne doesn't appreciate Dulaney throwing her words back in
          her face.JOANNEYes, I slept with him but that was a
                    long time ago.DULANEYYou're lying.  Marsh was wearing a
                    cast on the tape.  It was right
                    before he went to Chicago and met
                    Miss Lawson.  He dumped you for her,
                    didn't he?

          Joanne can't hold back the emotion that is building.JOANNEYes.DULANEYIt must have been horrible.  Having
                    to go there -- seeing them together -
                    - knowing he was sleeping with her in
                    the same bed he did with you.JOANNEI was jealous.  Of course I was hurt.
                    He switched me off like a little toy
                    he was finished playing with.  But I
                    didn't kill him.69Dulaney studies her.JOANNE(continuing)
                    I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney.
                    Killing Andrew wasn't in my best
                    interest.  As it is I'm out of a job
                    and I'm not in his will.DULANEYMoney isn't the only reason people
                    commit murder, Miss Braslow.

          Dulaney walks off.  Joanne stares after him.  Her face is cold,
          showing no sign of emotion.INT.  COURTROOM - DAYDulaney sits beside Rebecca, but he seems distant.  Cardenas
          stands up.CARDENASThe State calls Jeffery Roston.

          As soon as she hears the name Rebecca's face becomes tense,
          nervous.  Dulaney notices it.  He checks a list.DULANEYYour Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston
                    listed as a prosecution witness.CARDENASThe State's investigation just
                    uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday
                    afternoon in Chicago.

          bench.CARDENASYour Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover
                    of Miss Lawson's.JUDGE BURNHAMWhy didn't the State's investigation
                    uncover Mr. Roston earlier?CARDENASHe was away on an extended vacation
                    and just returned two days ago.JUDGE BURNHAMAlright -- I'm going to allow his
                    testimony.70DULANEYBut Your Honor--JUDGE BURNHAMThat's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.

          Dulaney walks back to his chair.  Rebecca appears genuinely
          nervous.INT.  COURTROOM - LATERCardenas stands before ROSTON a handsome man with salt and
          pepper hair in his late fifties.CARDENASMr. Roston, what was your
                    relationship with Miss Lawson?ROSTONWe were lovers.CARDENASHow long were you together?ROSTONFor about one year.CARDENASHow would you describe your sex life
                    with Miss Lawson?ROSTONIntense.CARDENASI know this is a very personal
                    subject, but could you be a little
                    more specific?ROSTONIt was wild.  She was constantly
                    trying to get me more and more worked
                    up -- kinky things.  I tried to
                    satisfy her the best I could, but it
                    was difficult in my condition.CARDENASWhat kind of condition are you
                    referring to?ROSTONI had a bad heart.71There is an AUDIBLE GASP from the crowd.  Cardenas waits,
          giving the jury plenty of time to digest the implications of
          Roston's last statement.

          Dulaney looks at Rebecca dumbfounded.  He tries to control his
          surprise from the eyes of the jury, but he can't.  He stares
          ahead with a blank expression as he listens to the rest of the
          testimony.CARDENASWhat happened next?ROSTONI had bypass surgery.CARDENASAnd how are you now?ROSTONFine.  The doctors say if I keep
                    taking care of myself I can live to
                    be a very old man.CARDENASHow did your relationship with Miss
                    Lawson progress after the surgery?ROSTONIt didn't.CARDENASWhy not?ROSTONShe left me.

          Dulaney slowly turns and looks at Rebecca.  The anger and his
          sense of betrayal show on his face.CARDENASWhy did she say she was leaving?ROSTONShe didn't.  She just left.CARDENASWhy do you think she left you?ROSTONWell -- I think that after the
                    operation she realized that...

          It takes Dulaney a few seconds to object to the question.  He
          is clearly preoccupied with the implications of Roston's
          testimony.72DULANEYObjection.  The question calls for a
                    conclusion on the part of the
                    witness.CARDENASYour Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the
                    defendant for many months.  I feel
                    that his opinion is valid in
                    substantiating the character of the
                    Miss Lawson.DULANEYThe opinion of a scorned lover is
                    hardly an objective view.JUDGE BURNHAMObjection sustained.CARDENASDid Miss Lawson ever give you any
                    indication why she was leaving?DULANEYObjection.  The witness has already
                    stated that Miss Lawson left without
                    an explanation.JUDGE BURNHAMMr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on
                    to another line of questioning.CARDENASWhen you say your sexual relations
                    with Miss Lawson were intense what
                    exactly do you mean?ROSTONIt was like she was trying to push me
                    as far as she could.  She called it
                    opening new doors.CARDENASCan you give the court an example?ROSTONIt was like sex was a game to her.
                    She got off on the control.  She
                    always used to tell me it had to be
                    her way.

          This strikes a chord with Dulaney.73ROSTON(continuing)
                    It's hard to resist a woman as
                    beautiful as she is.CARDENASWhat would she do that made it hard
                    to resist?ROSTONShe's a woman who is very much aware
                    of her own sexuality.  Sometimes I
                    felt she could read my mind.  It was
                    uncanny how she knew exactly what I
                    wanted.  A few nights before my heart
                    surgery Rebecca woke me.  She had
                    handcuffed me to the bed.

          There are a few SNICKERS from the crowd.  Dulaney is thinking
          about the familiarity of Roston's testimony.  Judge Burnham
          BANGS his GAVEL.  The crowd becomes silent.ROSTONShe told me that tonight we were
                    going to open new doors.  I asked her
                    to stop -- to take off the handcuffs,
                    but she wouldn't listen.CARDENASWhat did she say?

          Roston is clearly uncomfortable having to relate this part of
          his life.CARDENASMr. Roston I know this is difficult
                    for you, but it's important you tell
                    the court what she did.ROSTONShe said she was going to fuck me
                    like I've never been fucked before.

          More noise from the Crowd.  Judge Burnham is annoyed.  He BANGS
          his gavel again.JUDGE BURNHAMDue to the sensitive nature of this
                    witness' testimony and the inability
                    of the spectators to allow him to
                    complete it, I am clearing the
                    courtroom.

          Sounds of protest fill the room as the BAILIFFS start to usher
          out the crowd.74INT.  COURTROOM LATERThe gallery is empty.  Only Dulaney, Rebecca, Cardenas,
          Troxell, Roston, Judge Burnham, The Jury and Court Officials
          remain.CARDENASWhat did she do next, Mr. Roston?ROSTONShe started touching herself and
                    telling me how much she wanted me.
                    She reached down and put me inside
                    her.  My doctor had warned me about
                    exerting myself -- but you really
                    don't think of those things at a
                    moment like that.  You just think
                    about how beautiful this woman is --
                    how much you want her.  How deeply
                    you want to please her.

                    At first it started off slowly -- but
                    the rhythm built and built.    Every
                    time I got close to an orgasm she
                    would stop.  Eventually I started to
                    have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just
                    kept going -- faster and faster.  No
                    matter what I said she wouldn't stop.
                    I really thought for a moment I was
                    going to die.CARDENASIf you knew it was bad for you why
                    did you do it?ROSTONI couldn't help myself.  You get lost
                    inside a women like her.  It was like
                    a drug.  It was the best sex I ever
                    had.CARDENASWhat happened after that?ROSTONI woke up the next morning and she
                    was gone.CARDENASDid you change your will while you
                    were with Miss Lawson?75ROSTONYes.CARDENASWho was your primary beneficiary?ROSTONShe was.CARDENASThank you.  The State rests.JUDGE BURNHAMMister Dulaney?

          Dulaney is stunned -- deep in thought.  He doesn't appear to
          hear the question.JUDGE BURNHAMMister Dulaney?

          Dulaney looks at the jury.  What he sees isn't good.  He thinks
          for a moment.  He leans over and quickly speaks with Rebecca.
          We cannot hear them -- but their conversation is heated.
          Rebecca says something.  Dulaney looks at Roston.  A beat.
          Dulaney stands.DULANEYMr. Roston, you said it was the best
                    sex you ever had.  Is that the best
                    sex with a woman, or a man?

          Cardenas bolts from his seat.CARDENASObjection!DULANEYI'll rephrase the question.  Mr.

                    preferences are not at issue in this
                    trial.DULANEYYour Honor, I'm trying to establish
                    the sense of betrayal Miss Lawson
                    felt when she discovered the man she
                    lived with was a different person
                    than she thought he was.

          Judge Burnham thinks for a moment.76JUDGE BURNHAMThe witness will answer the question.DULANEYMr. Roston?ROSTONYes.DULANEYAnd your sexual tastes were something

          A pause.  Roston thinks, struggling to make a decision.ROSTONNo.  We worked things out.  It was
                    three weeks later when I told her
                    about the heart surgery that she
                    left.

          walk to the couch together in silence.  Dulaney sits.  Rebecca
          lifts a BOTTLE of CHAMPAGNE out of an ice bucket.DULANEYWhat's that for?REBECCATo celebrate how masterfully you

                    it.

          Dulaney stares at her.  The person he sees has no feelings --
          no empathy for anyone.DULANEYYou killed him -- didn't you?REBECCAI knew you were thinking that.  I
                    could see it in your eyes today in
                    the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank.

                    they can never have.  I'm a cold,

          Rebecca picks up a REMOTE CONTROL from the coffee table and
          pushes a button.CLOSE ON TELEVISIONA TAPE of Dulaney making love to Rebecca fills the screen.  It
          is wild, passionate.CLOSE ON DULANEYhe is dumbfounded as he watches.  The implications of what this
          tape could do to him run through his mind.

          Something in Dulaney snaps.  He grabs Rebecca.  They struggle,
          falling down onto the coffee table.  The CHAMPAGNE bottle
          crashes to the floor.  Rebecca rolls off the table to the
          floor.  She sits up and moves away from Dulaney by pushing
          herself backwards.  Dulaney lunges at her.  His hand grabbing
          her ankle.  Rebecca kicks -- breaks free -- stands up.  Dulaney
          gets to his feet -- runs after her.  He grabs her by the throat
          and smashes her into the wall.  He slaps her across the face.
          A thin stream of blood flows from the corner of her mouth.  She
          smiles.REBECCAIt gets easier, doesn't it?  Once you
                    open the door it never closes.

          Dulaney realizes what he is doing.  He stares at her in horror,
          then walks towards the door. He stops.  Goes back to the VHS
          machine.  He pushes the EJECT BUTTON on the VCR, removes the
          tape and destroys it.79REBECCAI've got another copy.  How do you

                    relationship with Dr. Paley.MISS SELLERSWe dated for about a month last year.DULANEYThen what happened?MISS SELLERSI realized he wasn't serious.  He was
                    seeing other women -- asking other
                    nurses at the hospital out, so I

                    couldn't just walk out on him.  He

                    night.  Show up at my house and bang
                    on the door.  Finally after two weeks
                    I went to his office one day to tell
                    him to stop.DULANEYWhat did he say?MISS SELLERSHe laughed -- and basically said he
                    would decide when it was over.DULANEYDo you remember his exact words?84MISS SELLERSYes.  He said, "If you want to play

          Dulaney stands and walks over to the jury.DULANEYThe Prosecution's case is built on

                    Lawson have done this?  Is it
                    possible that she did that? Where are

                    could be capable of murder.  Did she
                    force Andrew Marsh to make love to
                    her?  Did she hold a gun to his head?
                    No.  Andrew Marsh wanted her -- and

                    cocaine as the terminus.  The

                    wasn't she?  You knew we'd see her on
                    the tape and find out about her coke
                    problem.  After that, the digging
                    should have been easy -- but we
                    missed the will.  You knew we were
                    following her, so you called Koehler
                    and had him contact her.  That put us
                    right back on track.  All we needed
                    then was to prove that she had an
                    opportunity.  The drug store took
                    care of that.  She dropped off the
                    stuff and you came back and killed
                    him.  Didn't you?

          He grabs her by the shoulders and pushes her into the wall.

          with rage.  Dulaney continues to smash her into the wall.

          Rebecca reaches onto the desk -- lifts up a FOUNTAIN PEN and
          stabs it into Dulaney's shoulder at the base of his neck.

          breathless LAUGH drifts out of Dulaney as he starts to put it
