          and then a voice - male.TRAVERS (V.O.)(SINGING)Winds in the East
           Mist coming in--FADE IN:A whoosh of wind spins us around in a blue sky, spinning,
          spinning until we slow to a stop and find ourselves amongst
          white fluffy clouds. A shadow (oddly shaped like an umbrella)
          dances amongst the nimbus.TRAVERS (V.O.)--Like something is brewing,
           about to begin--
          The shadow's direction becomes purposeful - taking us down
          through the clouds, whipping us on the wind towards a small
          town in the distance.TRAVERS (V.O.)--Can't put me finger on what liesIN STORE--Downwards and downwards until it skittishly circles a large,
          bustling park and then swoops us into the lavish gardens.
          There, a ten-year-old girl plays in the lush grass; she puts
          the finishing touches to a miniature version of the large
          park she sits in - benches made from twigs, trees from
          flowers, picnic cups from acorns - and gives a satisfied nod.
          She wraps her arms tightly around her chest, lifts her face
          to the sky, a half-smile threatening to break across her
          concentrated face. This is the young P.L. TRAVERS (whom we
          will also know as GINTY.)TRAVERS (V.O.)--But I feel what's to happen, allHAPPENED BEFORE--Her little brow is furrowed with imagination and then, all of
          a sudden, the smile breaks free as something in her mind
          becomes real.INT. SHAWFIELD ST - PAMELA'S OFFICE - LONDON - MORNING (1961)P.L. TRAVERS sits in her rocking chair (in the same position
          as above) arms clasped tightly around her body, face to the
          sky. Older, beautiful; striking blue eyes aid her air of
          stiff and steely determination.
          Her office is a canvas of a life well travelled. Buddha
          smiles from every corner, framed poetry and letters adorn the
          walls alongside pictures of Pamela throughout the years with
          men we will not come to know and everywhere, china hens sit
          on shelves, their wings clasped to their chests, brooding.
          Despite the multitude of objects, the room is peaceful,
          white.
          Downstairs the doorbell rings.
          Pamela closes her eyes, breathes.
          It rings again, Pamela shakes her head, tuts. She stands up,
          smooths down her skirt with flat palms. Breathes.INT. SHAWFIELD ST - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - MORNINGPamela opens the front door and squints as a flood of
          sunlight and cherry blossom petals float over the threshold.
          DIARMUID RUSSELL (45) - bright, youthful - waits to be asked
          inside. Pamela is not pleased to see him.DIARMUIDMrs Travers.INT. PAMELA'S LIVING ROOM - MORNINGPamela and Diarmuid sit in silence. Diarmuid looks at her,
          she looks out of the window.DIARMUID PAMELAYou're ready to--? Like pink clouds on sticks.DIARMUIDExcuse me?PAMELAThe cherry blossoms(BEAT)I was trying to think of what they--
          Diarmuid looks at his watch.DIARMUIDThe car should be here, may I use--(THE PHONE)PAMELA(OVER)I cancelled it.DIARMUIDYou--?(PANICKED)What? Pamela!PAMELAMrs Travers.DIARMUIDMrs Travers, please, why--
           (sugaring his tone)
           Why would you cancel the car?PAMELAI shan't be going.
          Diarmuid buries his face in his hands.DIARMUIDWe've been through this--PAMELAI've changed my mind.DIARMUIDYou can't.PAMELAWith all due respect Mr Russell I
           am on very good terms with my own
           faculty and exceedingly confident
           in its decision making
           capabilities.
          Diarmuid's shoulders visibly sag, he lets out a long
          frustrated breath.DIARMUIDYou made an agreement. Do you
           understand? A verbal agreement.PAMELAWhy in the world are you speaking
           to me as if I am a neonate?DIARMUIDHE'LL--PAMELAHe'll what? Sue? He is most welcome
           to every penny I don't have.DIARMUIDLOOK--(HE SIGHS)--I've represented you for a long
           time. I like to think of you as aFRIEND--Pamela snorts.DIARMUID (CONT'D)I like to think of it, believe me I
           know it's not reciprocated.(BEAT)I would never suggest you do
           something that would cause you
           anguish but there's no more money
           Pamela-- Mrs Travers. Simply no
           more. Sales have dried up, no more
           royalties. You refuse to write
           further books so--(BEAT)Do you understand? I'm frightened
           that you don't understand what that
           means.
          Pamela looks out of the window, the cherry blossom her focus.PAMELAI know what he's going to do to her-
           - she'll be cavorting and
           twinkling! Careening towards a
           happy ending like a kamikaze--DIARMUID--We've been trying to do this deal
           for twenty years! He's agreed to
           both your stipulations. No
           animation, script approval-- I--PAMELAUse her to pay my bills? If I
           believed in a hell I'd be sitting
           in its waiting room--DIARMUID(OVER)--script approval! He's never
           granted anything like that before!
           I don't know what else to--
          He looks around.DIARMUID (CONT'D)Where is Polly?PAMELAI fired her.
          Diarmuid shakes his head, sighs.PAMELA (CONT'D)It's just as well. It seems I can't
           afford her anymore anyway!
          Pamela looks to the ceiling, breathes.PAMELA (CONT'D)(MOMENTARILY SOFT)You don't know how much she means
           to me.DIARMUIDPolly?PAMELAOf course not Polly!
          Pamela huffs, digs her heel into the rug.PAMELA (CONT'D)(it's a filthy word)
           Los Angeles.DIARMUIDYou have only to go there and work
           for two weeks. Collaborate. That's
           it. You haven't signed the rights
           over, yet.PAMELAYet!DIARMUIDYou must make it work Mrs Travers--PAMELAOh I must, must I?DIARMUIDYou need the money. I don't want
           you to see you-- (broke).PAMELA(OVER)Stop saying money! It's a filthy,
           disgusting word!DIARMUIDI am picking up the telephone MrsTRAVERS--Diarmuid gets up.PAMELAI have final say?DIARMUIDYou do.PAMELA(TO HERSELF)I have final say.(TO DIARMUID)(MORE)PAMELA (CONT'D)And if I don't like what they are
           doing to her?DIARMUIDYou don't sign the papers. He
           cannot make the film unless you
           grant the rights.(BEAT)It's an exploratory trip--
          Pamela looks at the cherry blossom again, a piece floats away
          from the tree and sticks to her living room window.DIARMUID (CONT'D)What do you say?PAMELA(TO HERSELF)I want to keep my house.EXT. MARYBOROUGH PARK - DAYA large hand taps Ginty on the shoulder, she looks up and
          smiles. TRAVERS GOFF (35) is handsome and rugged, a wild
          poetic look, like Ted Hughes or Dylan Thomas.TRAVERSExcuse me ma'am, have you seen my
           daughter? I was quite sure I had
           left her around here somewhere!
          Ginty giggles.TRAVERS (CONT'D)Her name is Helen, no, Shirley, erm-
           - goodness! I've quite forgotten!
           Could it be Prunella?GINTYNo!TRAVERSPamela?GINTYNo.TRAVERSYou're right still doesn't sound
           quite-- I'm sure I have a special
           name for her--GINTYGinty!TRAVERSWhy, thank you ma'am! Ginty it is
           of course!(BEAT)Now, have you seen her?GINTYIt's me!
          Travers puts his nose right up to hers, peering into her
          face.TRAVERSGosh! So it is! Well, thank
           goodness for that! I was positive I
           was going to be beheaded for losing
           Her Highness The Royal Princess
           Ginty Mc Featherfluffy!GINTYYou can't lose me!TRAVERSNever. I promise. I will never lose
           you!
          He swings her up onto his shoulders and gallops off through
          the park, neighing like a horse.TRAVERS (CONT'D)Hurry now! We mustn't be late! The
           adventure is about to begin!INT. PLANE - DAYPamela is hot and bothered trying to wrestle a bulging carpet
          bag into an overhead locker.FLIGHT ATTENDANTCan I help you?PAMELAI'm perfectly capable thank you.
          The flight attendant tries to help anyway.PAMELA (CONT'D)They've used all the space; so
           greedy.
          She glares at the people around her.FLIGHT ATTENDANTI'll take it Madam. I can put it
           up here -PAMELAI don't want it up there. I want it
           here, in the corresponding holding
           area for my assigned seat!FLIGHT ATTENDANTThe flight's closing in just a few
           moments Ma'am. I'll have to take
           it.
          Pamela narrows her eyes at the attendant as if to say `I dare
          you.' A woman, with an infant, stands up.WOMAN(TO ATTENDANT)You can put my bag up front
           instead.
          The flight attendant smiles thankfully and replaces the
          woman's bag with Pamela's.PAMELA(TO WOMAN)Will the child be a nuisance? It's
           an eleven hour flight.WOMAN(TAKEN ABACK)Er-- no, I--PAMELAJolly good.
          Pamela gives her a watery smile and takes the seat next to
          the window, she looks out at the tarmac.
          She closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, opens her eyes
          again and tucks her feet tidily together. She folds her hands
          neatly into her lap and looks straight ahead.PAMELA (CONT'D)(TO HERSELF)I hope we crash.
          The passenger across the aisle hears her, horrified!EXT. GOFF RESIDENCE - MARYBOROUGH - DAY (1906)BIDDY (3) and MARGARET - the girls mother, delicate, weak -
          stand outside of their lavish red-bricked home. Suitcases
          bulge at their feet. Margaret breathes a sigh of relief as
          she sees Travers hurrying towards them, he swings Ginty from
          his shoulders and plops her on the ground.MARGARETThe carriage?TRAVERSWho needs a carriage my love? A
           stroll is a gift!
           (beat, excited)
           Everybody ready?GINTY & BIDDYYes. Yep!
          Margaret takes her youngest child MOYA (1) from the nanny.TRAVERSCome along my team! We mustn't miss
           the train.MARGARET(to her staff)
           Thank you so much. For everything.GINTY(TO NANNY)See you soon Katie Nanna!
          She picks up her own case; Katie Nanna turns away,
          heartbroken.TRAVERSWalking bus!
          The family get into line, one behind the other, Travers in
          the lead.TRAVERS (CONT'D)Don't forget Andrew!
          Ginty takes Andrew's leash, her own case and somehow helps
          her sister too.TRAVERS (CONT'D)Ready? And off we go!
          Passersby tut and shake their heads at the noisy display as
          Travers and the girls march down the street.TRAVERS (CONT'D)Left, right, left, right! Coming
           through!
          Margaret stays for a beat, longingly taking in and storing a
          picture of the home she leaves behind.EXT. DOWNTOWN MARYBOROUGH - DAYThe procession continues into the bustling downtown.EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAYIt's hectic as tickets are purchased and a CLERK marks a
          chalkboard with destinations and mileage. Ginty stops, looks
          at the list. The last city is--GINTYALLORA--EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAYThe Great Western Queensland train chugs its way Westward
          from the verdant green of Maryborough toward the brown cake
          of Allora.EXT. ANGLE ON MARYBOROUGH - DAYAs it disappears. Ginty stands on the last train platform,
          watching her home, her past, fade into the distance.
          Ginty's face speaks resignation as it, and the train, recede
          as billowing white smoke and dust fill the frame.INT. PLANE - DAYPamela jolts in her seat, her eyes flit open. She's disturbed
          by her dreams, she flicks her hand in front of her face as if
          somehow batting the memories away. She sighs loudly and digs
          her heel into the carpet of the plane.INT. LAX - ARRIVALS - DAYA bleary eyed Pamela carries her two bags into the arrivals
          area. She's immediately hit by dazzling sunlight and a sea of
          signs bearing the names of various passengers and companies:
          she scans Paramount, Warner Brothers, MGM, finally falling
          upon her own name - P.L. Travers - underneath "Walt Disney
          Presents".PAMELAOh does he indeed?
          She approaches the uniformed driver (RALPH - Mickey Mouse on
          his lapel) who bursts into a beaming smile.RALPHTravers? P.L. Travers?PAMELAMrs.RALPHWelcome, Mrs P.L. Travers! Welcome
           to the City of Angels.
          Pamela sneers. He grabs her bags.RALPH (CONT'D)Let me take those.PAMELAI'm perfectly capable of-- Oh,
           nevermind.
          Ralph ushers Pamela through the doors--EXT. LAX - DAY--and into the sunlight.RALPHSun came out to say hello just to
           you.PAMELADon't be preposterous.
          Pamela sniffs the air.PAMELA (CONT'D)It smells. Like--RALPHJasmine.PAMELA--chlorine and sweat.
          Ralph chuckles.PAMELA (CONT'D)It's dreadful.EXT. LIMOSINE - DAYThe shiny black, tinted windowed limo cruises up La Cienega
          Blvd, passing all kinds of monstrous architecture and garish
          billboard advertising.INT. LIMOSINE - DAYPamela is diminutive on the back seat of the sprawling car.
          She eyes the champagne on ice, the flutes clinking in the in-
          car bar.PAMELA(TO HERSELF)Absurd.
          Ralph looks at her in the rearview.RALPHYou okay back there Mrs P.L.
           Travers?PAMELAIt's not Mrs P.L. It's just Mrs--
           Oh, it's so hot.RALPHNo problemo! We got a brand new air
           conditioning system, Missus; cool
           you right down in no time. Just
           about make you feel like you're in
           good old Engerland again! Things
           they can put in cars these days--
           (he shakes his head inAMAZEMENT)Gosh almighty.
          Pamela presses her fingers to her temples. She looks around,
          finds a button, pushes it and the screen rises between
          passenger and driver miraculously relieving her of Ralph's
          natter.RALPH (CONT'D)(happy as a clam)
           No problemo.EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAYWith its pink facade and flag flying turrets the hotel
          resembles a candy castle simmering under a midday sun.
          The limo glides into the forecourt.INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAYA porter opens the door to Pamela's suite and places her
          belongings on a luggage stand in the hallway.PORTERWould you like me to unpack for you
           ma'am?PAMELAUnpack?PORTERTo take your items from their cases
           and hang them in the wardrobe
           ma'am.PAMELAYoung man, if it is your wish to
           handle ladies garments I suggest
           you take employment in a
           launderette.
          The porter has no idea what to say, he hovers at the door.PAMELA (CONT'D)Yes?
          His eyes flick to his empty palm and back to Pamela. She
          closes the door on him.PAMELA (CONT'D)Odd.
          She turns and for the first time takes in--PAMELA (CONT'D)Oh my.
          --The LUDICROUS suite she has been assigned; it is opulent
          beyond imagine but it's classy decor has been rather
          diminished by the array of Disney gifts splattered across
          every surface of the room.PAMELA (CONT'D)Oh no, no, no.
          Disney Flowers, Disney champagne, Disney exotic fruit
          baskets, Disney chocolates, Disney posters, cuddly Donald,
          Pluto and Minnie toys and - taking up the entire bed - the
          BIGGEST stuffed Mickey Mouse imaginable. Imagine it. Nope.BIGGER!Pamela cannot contain her horror. She stares at it in disgust
          for a moment, and then her eyes fall upon three pears in the
          fruit basket. She stops still for a second before rushing
          over and picking them out. She turns them over in her hands
          before an enormous wave of panic washes over her.PAMELA (CONT'D)(muttering to the pears)
           This won't do.
          She throws open the balcony doors for fresh air and is
          greeted with dry arid heat, dust, dazzling sunlight--EXT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - DAY--Arid heat, dazzling sunlight. Travers, Margaret and the
          children climb stand in a line at the top of a pathway. From
          their perspective all there is to see is a cloud of swirling
          red dust; it obscures and then gradually reveals her new
          home. The surrounding land yellow and burnt - unlike the lush
          greens of Maryborough. The house is ramshackle and meagre.
          A swayback white nag wanders near a solitary tree and a few
          skinny chickens strut about the porch.TRAVERSA palace! Complete with mighty
           steed.GINTYAnd chickens.MARGARETOH--Travers puts an arm around her shoulder.TRAVERSWe'll build beautiful memories here
           my angel.
          Margaret offers him a trusting smile.MARGARETYes.
          Travers takes Ginty and Biddy's hands and they run towards
          their new home. The chickens scatter.TRAVERS(in the distance)
           --in this house you get to share a
           bedroom!
          Margaret looks at the surrounding area, there's simply
          nothing but barren land and red dust for miles.EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - POOL - DAYUNDERWATERSPLOSH! A green bomb disturbs the tranquil surface and then
          another SPLOSH!
          We rise through the water to see Pamela on her balcony
          throwing the pears, one by one, into the swimmer-free
          swimming pool.INT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - SUITE - CONTINUOUSPAMELAGood riddance.
          She breathes a sigh of relief and closes the balcony doors.PAMELA (CONT'D)(TO HERSELF)Well, first things first.
          She gathers up the Disney paraphernalia and shoves it all in
          a closet.
          She picks up her bags and goes through to the bedroom where
          the BIGGEST stuffed Mickey Mouse imaginable takes up the
          entire bed. Imagine it. Nope. BIGGER!PAMELA (CONT'D)Good Lord.
          Pamela drops her bags, grabs Mickey and places him on the
          floor, facing the wall.PAMELA (CONT'D)(TO MICKEY)And you can stay there until you
           learn the art of subtlety.
          Pamela opens her carpetbag and begins to unpack. She takes
          from it a bottle of pills, which she places on her night
          stand, followed by another bottle and another and another.
          The potions keep coming, as do creams and books and make-up,
          the bag is endless. Things, things and more things come
          streaming out of it and once the night stand is full she uses
          windowsills and any other available surface for her miniature
          Buddhas. Finally she takes out an impossibly large framed
          picture of herself. She holds it up, admires it, takes down
          an existing painting and replaces it with her own image.PAMELA (CONT'D)There.
          Pamela is restless, she looks around the room, stands in
          front of a full length mirror, admiring herself. She turns
          her face slightly to catch it at its best angle. She leans
          forward and explores the contours of her face, surprisingly
          unlined for a woman of her years. She smiles, full of vanity.PAMELA (CONT'D)(SATISFIED)Yes.
           (answering an imaginaryQUESTION)Well, no, I don't suppose I do
           mind.
          She laughs, but Pamela finds joy difficult so it comes out as
          an ugly snort.PAMELA (CONT'D)Now, really! Flatterer!
           (then scolding herself)
           Silly girl.
          She turns her attention away from the mirror and picks up a
          remote control staring at it with bemusement. She points it
          at the television hitting random buttons until suddenly the
          TV bursts into life.PAMELA (CONT'D)Oh!
          She clicks again, the TV goes off, again and it's on. A
          housewife advertises dish soap with glee, as if dish soap is
          the greatest thing ever invented.PAMELA (CONT'D)Soap for the brains.
          She changes the channel and stares blankly at a man on a
          black and white screen. It takes a moment before she realizes
          that staring back at her is the charming, moustached, kindly
          face of WALTER ELIAS DISNEY (58) on The Wonderful World of
          Disney Show. Pamela raises an eyebrow--PAMELA (CONT'D)Well, well-- There you are.CU: TV SCREENWalt is ringing a little bell but no sound comes out.WALTDon't worry! There's nothing wrong
           with your television set. This is a
           pixie bell, the sound is much too

          flesh, appears at the end of the corridor, his arms
          outstretched.WALTWell, there ya are at last!
          Pamela gets up, smooths down her skirt, and makes her way
          serenely towards the man, who rushes down the corridor to
          greet her.WALT (CONT'D)Oh my dear gal!

          He picks up the pot again and pours the tea.PAMELA (CONT'D)And a spoonful of sugar.
          He stirs.PAMELA (CONT'D)You don't mean for this film to be

           Poppins does not sing.WALTOh yes she does!PAMELAWhen?WALTIn your books!PAMELAThose aren't songs! They're

           frivolous and wholly unnecessary
           for a governess, an educatress. No.
           It would just ruin it.
          Walt is baffled. He takes a sip of tea, it's disgusting, he
          spits it back into his cup surreptitiously, then coughs
          loudly. Pamela's jaw drops.PAMELA (CONT'D)I won't have her turned into one of
           your silly cartoons.
          Walt takes a sharp breath on `silly' and then plasters the

          He moves closer to her, takes her hand, she needs it for her

           number 17, instead of just 17, yes?
           It's proper.BOB & DICKNo one's going to see it.PAMELAI will see it.
          She makes a note in her script and looks to the others who
          are dumbstruck.PAMELA (CONT'D)Write it down, write it down, chop
           chop.
          Don makes the note and is ready to move on but Pamela is
          staring at Dick and Bob. They dutifully pick up their pencils
          and note their scripts too.PAMELA (CONT'D)Is that on the tape?
          Don glances towards the swirling tape recorder and nods.DONYes.PAMELAGood-- onwards.
          They are interrupted by DOLLY carrying a new tray of
          refreshments.DOLLYI'm sorry to interrupt.PAMELAIs this a joke?DOLLYExcuse me?PAMELADo you think you are a comedienne?DOLLYI'm sorry I don't understand.

          trees made from flowers, a small hole filled with water for a
          pond, park benches made with twigs and miniature wooden
          clothes-peg people. Ginty puts the finishing touches to the
          bandstand and sits back, staring in wonder.
          The moment is broken with the sound of hooves as her father
          appears, atop his horse.TRAVERSAhhh, there's my girl.
          The horse moves up to her.TRAVERS (CONT'D)That's it Albert. Give Ginty a
           smooch. There's a good boy, give
           her a little smooch.
          The velvety muzzle of the horse "smooches" Ginty's neck and
          ear as Travers climbs down from the nag.TRAVERS (CONT'D)Poor old Albert; he's your secret
           uncle you know? But a miserable,

           like to fly Ginty?
          She nods. He hauls himself onto Albert, leans down and swings
          Ginty up so she is facing him.TRAVERS (CONT'D)You trust me?
          She nods and wraps her arms around him looking backwards over

           that! My house is a terraced house
           with a pink door, white bricked

           (to herself, slightlyHYSTERICAL)Oh dear, it's all a big mistake.
           It's all wrong.DONIt's all wrong?PAMELAIt's too grand! The Banks family -
           they're normal, everyday sort of

           everyday! They're not aristocrats!DICKInteresting.
          Don allows a tiny smile. She is right. Pamela lingers over a
          picture of the parrot head umbrella, a split second of
          something like recognition on her face and then she simply
          moves on.PAMELA(TO HERSELF)Okay.
          She stops again in front of a sketch of Mrs Banks wearing a
          suffragette ribbon.PAMELA (CONT'D)(SIGHING)Do I even have to say it?DONUm-- yeah?PAMELAWhy in the world have you made Mrs
           Banks a silly suffragette?BOBI wonder if Emmeline P would agree
           with that adjective--PAMELAQuite possibly, looking back.
          Dick mouths `oh my god!'DONIt does seem strange that Mrs Banks
           allows her children to spend all of
           their time with the nanny when she
           has no job to speak of--PAMELAAre you calling Mrs Banks
           neglectful?BOBYep.DONNo! Of course not! We just felt
           that if she had a job it would go

           difficult job and one that not
           everybody is up to, that not
           everybody should have taken on in

          The boys see that Pamela is talking about something
          meaningful to her and they begin to soften for a brief
          moment, until--PAMELA (CONT'D)I will NOT have her called Cynthia!
           Absolutely not. It feels unlucky.
          Dick makes a curly wurly cuckoo sign at Bob.PAMELA (CONT'D)No it should be something warm, a
           bit sexy.
          They all nearly choke at the word `sexy' coming out of her

          it, a split second of utter confusion crosses her face.PAMELA (CONT'D)This isn't Mr Banks?
          She turns to face Don and the boys.PAMELA (CONT'D)This isn't him.DONAhm, yeah, that's him--PAMELAHe has a set of moustaches!DONIn the books he--PAMELAI told the illustrator I didn't

          Ginty and RANDOLPH BELHATCHETT are startled for a second by a

          Ginty is devastated. But more than this there's a hardening
          in her small face, a sense of disillusionment that so far

          Ralph, shifts nervously from foot to foot. He's not quite
          sure what to say to her or why he brought the tea.

          and pieces of twig and bloom that she's plucking from the
          area around her.RALPHEverything okay Ma'am? Would you

          She takes them through the hallway, stopping momentarily
          outside the door to her fathers bedroom. It is slightly ajar

          by their own thoughts. The sunshine, the joyful crowds just
          background colour.
          They pass by a store front and Walt glances up at the window.

          Pamela gently bobs up and down, Walt waves to her and she
          sees the unbridled thrill from the child in Mister Disney
          spilling out. The tiniest, tiniest of smiles threatens to
          surface on her lips as he points a finger in the air as if

          the doctor and Aunt Ellie.
          Ellie is holding a pile of blood stained sheets.
          Ginty stands frozen, trying to still the panicked beating of
          her heart.
          Margaret spies Ginty and moves towards her as if in slo-mo.
          There are flecks of blood on her dress. She is ashen,

          sheets twisted, still wet with sweat, flecked and spotted
          with blood. The front of her father's nightdress is also
          bloodstained. Ginty's eyes reach his face. Travers lies, eyes
          open, mouth open, teeth slightly red-stained, neither

           to your hotel right away.PAMELAThat's very kind, Mr Disney. I knew
           you wouldn't have forgotten me.WALTPam, how could I?PAMELAHow indeed? You did, after all,
           assure me that I wouldn't be
           disappointed.INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAYThe porter lets Pamela into her room, and doesn't even bother
          hovering for a tip.
          Pamela turns and it's like deju vu - the flowers, the
          chocolates, the champagne, a VIP invitation to the premiere
          of Walt Disney's Mary Poppins. And, of course, the ubiquitous
          stuffed Mickey Mouse.PAMELA(TO MICKEY)I thought I left you in London.EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - FORECOURT - NIGHTPamela looks wonderful in a long white gown with turquoise
          silk gloves to her elbows and matching wrap falling from her
          shoulders.PAMELA(TO DOORMAN)Would you call me a taxi please?DOORMANAbsolutely.
          The doorman goes to find her a cab and in his absence a limo
          pulls up to the kerb. Pamela doesn't dare get her hopes up
          but the door swings open and there he is, her favorite person
          in America.RALPHHad a feeling a certain friend of
           mine might be needing me tonight.PAMELARalph!
          She rushes to him and they give each other a friendly hug.RALPHYou look like a million bucks!
           Let's get you to the ball.
          He opens the back door for her and she climbs in.EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER - HOLLYWOOD - NIGHTIt's spectacular! Disney's biggest Hollywood opening. Bulbs
          flash continuously as limo after limo pulls up at the red
          carpet. Ushers are dressed as English bobbies. Reporters
          stand on podiums in colourful suits, Penguins dance their
          hearts out in front of the theater. Pearly Kings and Queens
          play for the onlookers. Crowds and crowds of fans scream
          every time a bulb flashes, waving their autograph books and
          posters in the air. Every Disney character imaginable bounces
          up and down the lines of well-wishers, hugging them, dancing
          for them, signing their booklets. Hollywood Blvd is
          completely shut down and the atmosphere is like the happiest
          party you could ever go to.INT. LIMO - NIGHTRalph takes the car slowly through the crowds. Onlookers
          press their faces against the windows trying to make out who
          is inside. Pamela is nervous, everyone else has someone with
          them but Pamela must brave the crowd alone.EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER - HOLLYWOOD -NIGHTThe limo stops at the edge of the carpet and Ralph jumps out.
          He rushes round to Pamela's side and helps her from the car.
          Immediately a round of flashes go off and Pamela puts her arm
          up to shield her eyes. It's too much.RALPH(in her ear)
           This is your night. None of this
           would be possible without you.
          She brings her arm down, straightens her dress and breaks
          into a smile, making her way down the carpet to frantic
          whispers amongst the press and autograph hunters of: "Who is
          that?" "Is that anyone?" Pamela spots Walt, Dick Van Dyke and
          Julie Andrews being interviewed together up ahead.
          Mickey Mouse bounces down the carpet and slows-- he and
          Pamela lock eyes for a brief moment. He holds out his gloved
          hand, she takes it and together they watch as a huge toy
          train chugs to a halt on the blvd and hundreds upon hundreds
          of coloured balloons fly out of it's roof and into the air.EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATRE - NIGHTPamela moves through the spangling, glittering, perfect
          toothed Hollywood crowd and no-one pays any attention to her.INT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHTThe auditorium is jam packed. Pamela is seated in front of
          Walt Disney. Don, the Shermans and their families are in the
          same row as her - Bob Sherman next to her. The lights begin
          to dim. The overture begins--
          We stay close on Pamela as the sounds of the overture fade
          and the melody of a single tin whistle playing one of Travers
          old melody's rings in her ears.
          We hear snippets of the film in the background but we remain
          with Pamela.
          She looks around at the faces in the audience - laughing,
          humming, sad, happy, joyous.
          Intercut with images from Pamela's childhood and the voices
          of Bert and Jane -
          Ellie's parrot head umbrella--BERTYou know, begging your pardon, but
           the one my heart goes out to is

           bank day after day, hemmed in by

          The tuppence and rolling pears--BERT (CONT'D)I don't like to see any living

          Ginty pressing the final bottle into her father's hand--BERTThey makes cages in all sizes and
           shapes, you know.

           changes.
          And then an image from the film:
          George Banks walks away from us down the misty tree-lined
          London street, on his way to be fired from the bank.
          Walt Disney watches with quiet satisfaction.
          Pamela however has tears coursing down her face. Her
          shoulders heave as she tries desperately not to sob out loud
          but people are noticing, looking at her.
          Disney leans forward, placing a hand on her shoulder. She
          reaches up and grips it tightly, unable to speak.WALTIt's all right, Mrs Travers. It's
           alright. Mr Banks is going to be
           all right. I promise.
          Pamela nods in gratitude, but cannot contain her sobs. It's
          all pouring from her now, in one immense catharsis.PAMELANo, no. It's just that-- I can't, I
           can't abide cartoons!
          We stay on her face as we bring up the final song of the
          film: Let's Go Fly A Kite. The audience around her are
          smiling, laughing, singing along. Pamela, the tears, silent
          now, still pouring down her cheeks as she slowly begins to
          mouth along with the lyrics.
          And in her head one final image appears.
          Travers gaze falls upon Ginty, outside his bedroom window,
          sweeping. Their eyes meet for a brief moment, an unspoken
          understanding of what is to come, before his close with
          tiredness.TRAVERS (V.O.)Never. I promise. I will never lose
           you.DISSOLVE TO:EXT. MARYBOROUGH PARK - DAYThe shadow of an umbrella leaves the ten-year-old Ginty
          sitting in the lush grass, arms wrapped tightly around her

          face.TRAVERS (V.O.)(SINGING)Winds in the East
