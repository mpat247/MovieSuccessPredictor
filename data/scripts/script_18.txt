          war, there was a fire - you
          should've been here for that.
          Anyway, so it was just a mess, they
          just let it fall apart. Then a
          bohemian inherited it in the 60's,

He just looks at her - `why're you still here' - she looks at
him confused by his pushing her away. Seriously curious.ABBIEYea, it's like they've got this
          feeling, and they don't have any
          skill, and they don't want skill,
          because it's really interesting
          what happens when your passion is
          bigger than the tools you have to
          deal with it. It creates this

wires all over his bare chest. Abbie and Julie are squished
into a corner. Dorothea moves around the nurses and
technicians still working, she finds his hand, puts it in
both of hers, presses her forehead against it.
She takes his hand, like she did when he was a baby in the
isolette, closes her eyes.

          a box of tampons, went home, read
          the instructions on the box in my
          bathroom, figured out how to put
