               Motel has passed its prime. A few beat up cars are parked 
               outside rooms. We CRANE DOWN to ROOM SEVEN. Curtains closed, 
               but someone is holding it open a crack, looking out. We PUSH 
               in CLOSE TO THE WINDOW and the EYE looking over the parking 
               lot. Then the curtain closes.INT. ROOM SEVEN - PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHTPeeling flowered wallpaper, ultra-cheap furniture. The man 
               moving away from the window is RODRIGUEZ. He is slender, 
               sports a thin mustache, hair slicked straight back. He's in 
               his late thirties. Slightly nervous.

               Another man sits on the couch, looking at a magazine. He is 
               forty, solidly built. His name is FRANK DIVINCI.DIVINCISays here they got slips in Honolulu. 
                         325 a month. Utilities included. 
                         That's not bad.

               Rodriguez sits down.DIVINCIBut I gotta get at least a forty 
                         footer. It'll handle rough water 
                         better and I'll need the room if I'm 
                         gonna live on it.

               Rodriguez stands up, moves back to the window. Divinci looks 
               up.RODRIGUEZI don't know how you do it.DIVINCIWhat?RODRIGUEZHow you can think about Hawaii now?DIVINCIMy heart's in Hawaii.RODRIGUEZYou never been there. How can your

                         you'd rather be other than here?RODRIGUEZNo, I'm saying I just don't know how 
                         you can think about Hawaii right 
                         now.DIVINCIIf I was in Hawaii right now, I 
                         wouldn't be thinking about here. See 
                         the difference?RODRIGUEZNo.DIVINCILook, I'm not in Hawaii, I'm here. 
                         But I don't want to be here, I want 
                         to be in Hawaii. I can't be in Hawaii, 
                         therefore I think about it so as to 
                         not get depressed about being here.RODRIGUEZBut I'm here, I know I'm here, I 
                         don't like being here, but I can't 
                         be anyplace else because I look around 
                         and I see all this shit. How do you 
                         get around that?! That's what I'm

               Divinci nods. Rodriguez looks at his watch.RODRIGUEZIt's time. No more Hawaii, okay?

               We HEAR LOUD RAP MUSIC.INT. CADILLAC - NIGHTLIONEL HUDD drives. Hudd is thirty. African American. The 
               MUSIC is loud. His clothes lean to African roots. A WOMAN 
               sits next to the passenger window. Her name is CYNTHIA WEBB. 
               Cynthia is thirty-five, dressed in short provocative skirt, 
               tight top. A little too much make-up. She's lead a hard life.

               She glances at Hudd. Hudd glances at her, looks down at her 
               skirt hiked up on her leg.CYNTHIALeft at the corner.

               Hudd's eyes linger on her thighs for a moment, then he turns

               bass.EXT. PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHTThe Cadillac pulls into the parking lot. Parks in front of

               leads him to SEVEN. Knocks.

               The curtains pull back. Divinci looks at Hudd and Cynthia. 
               She nods to him. The door unlocks and opens.

               Cynthia enters. Hudd looks around again. Then follows.INT. MOTEL ROOM SEVEN - NIGHTDivinci waits at the door. He and Hudd eye each other as 
               Hudd enters the room. Divinci looks out, making sure no one 
               has followed, then shuts the door.DIVINCIHope you don't mind me checkin' you 
                         for weapons.HUDDHell yes I mind.

               Divinci hesitates. This could break the deal.HUDDI just don't want no man handlin' 
                         me.

               Hudd looks at Cynthia. The suggestion is taken.DIVINCIOkay. Check him.

               Hudd spreads his legs, lifts his arms. Cynthia would rather 
               not have the job, but there's no choice.HUDDLotta good hidin' places on this 
                         body. Check good.

               Cynthia runs her hands over Hudd, checking pockets, pants, 
               sleeves. Finally coming to his crotch. Hudd smiles.HUDDCareful. It's loaded.

               Cynthia has heard it all before. She's not squeamish in the 
               least and she gives him a good going over.CYNTHIAHe's got nothin'.

               She smiles back at Hudd. Then moves away, sits on the couch 
               and seductively crosses her legs.

               Divinci, satisfied, pulls a PLASTIC BAG packed tight with 
               COCAINE out of his pocket, tosses it to Hudd.

               Hudd sits on the couch, opens the bag, sticks his finger in 
               and tastes the contents. But never takes his eyes off Divinci.HUDDNot bad, not bad. Any more where 
                         this came from?DIVINCIMaybe.HUDDThen maybe we talk again.DIVINCIMaybe.

               Hudd stands, unzips his pants. Reaches in to grab his cock, 
               but instead, pulls out a stack of MONEY. Inch thick.HUDDTold you there was a lotta good hidin' 
                         places on this body.

               Hudd hands the money to Divinci and pockets the plastic bag. 
               Then crosses to the door. Glances back at Cynthia.HUDDBet you gotta lotta nice hidin'

               Hudd watches as the car pulls around to pass.

               He glances at the CAR as it pulls past him, but all we SEE

               sides of the street. An alley runs between two of the 
               buildings. A TAXI pulls up in front. HEADLIGHTS SHINING on a 
               MAN passed out in the street.

               Cynthia exits the taxi. The taxi pulls away. She glances at 
               the man passed out in the street.

               His clothes are ragged. He's filthy. His face covered in 
               beard and greasy dirty hair. Hard to tell how old he is. 
               Maybe forty. Maybe eighty. Who knows? His hand clutches a 
               bottle in a bag.CYNTHIAHey, Joe, wake up. Get outa the street

               She nudges him with her foot. The man groans, rolls back.

                         the street.

               The man, JOE, is silent for a moment, then he starts to crawl -- 
               toward the middle of the street.CYNTHIAOther way, Joe.

               Joe turns his crawl toward the curb. Cynthia watches him for 
               a moment. He is truly pathetic.CYNTHIAForget it, Joe. Maybe you're better 
                         off right there. I don't think you'd 
                         even feel it.

               Cynthia's eyes open and she looks up at Divinci. He's smiling, 
               holding up FIVE ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.CYNTHIAI already worked for that.

               Divinci unzips his pants.DIVINCIThis is a bonus.CYNTHIAFor who?

               Divinci smiles. Cynthia snatches the money. Divinci starts 
               to undress.DIVINCIThis ain't my fault. This is a failure 
                         of our educational system. If you

               Divinci's pants.CUT TO:KEY - INSERTED INTO DOOR LOCK - NIGHTA door is pushed open. Rodriguez enters his one bedroom 
               apartment. Starts to shut the door when TWO MEN appear from 
               the shadows. The first is short, well dressed. His name is 
               VIC. The second is large, heavy-set, shaved head. His name

                         neighbors gonna think?VICI apologize. I understand your 
                         concerns. But you must understand 
                         that, unlike a bank, I cannot rely

                         add, contributes significantly to my 
                         overhead. I am the real loser here. 
                         And I am concerned about your

                         no. I loan money at excessively high 
                         interest rates to pricks like you 
                         who can't control their urges to 
                         lose big money playing cards and 
                         then I am forced to stay up all night 
                         trying to convince them that I have 
                         needs, too. The point of which is, I

               Rodriguez steps toward Vic, but Cutless Supreme slides in 
               between them. Rodriguez isn't going to win this one.VICAll I'm askin' is that you be 
                         responsible. Is that unreasonable?

               Rodriguez backs off, hesitates as he runs over his options. 
               There aren't any. He reaches into his pocket, pulls out some 
               of his night's earnings.RODRIGUEZFour thousand is all I got.VICI am proportionally reassured. You 
                         purchased yourself an extension.

               keeping the JURY riveted. The presiding Judge is a WOMAN,JUDGE WEINBERG.HELEN-- when the defendant, Clyde Dunner, 
                         entered the house of George and Carol

                         pistol in his hand. He entered the

                         marriage to Carol's sister, Paula.

               The defendant is hardly listening. His attention is on TWO 
               MEN SITTING BEHIND the prosecution table. And he turns to 
               glare at them. The two men are DETECTIVES RODRIGUEZ andDIVINCI.Clyde glares at them as if he'd like to get up right now, 
               walk over to them and cut off their heads. Actually, that's

                         movie when he entered the living

               John Oblinger, his attorney, catches Clyde's murderous look 
               and instructs him, with a point of his hand, to pay attention

               A YOUNG MAN, looking very upset, enters the courtroom, shows 
               i.d. to a GUARD, then makes his way down the aisle. He tries
