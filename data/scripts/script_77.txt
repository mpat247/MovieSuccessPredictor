	over this extraordinary building. WE HOLD on this for a moment
	before weCUT TO:INT. A CORRIDOR IN THE RESIDENCE - DAYA SECRET SERVICE AGENT presses the button by the private
	elevator as he talks into his shirt cuff.AGENT COOPERLiberty's moving.

	Another AGENT rounds the corner into the corridor and is
	followed a step or two later byPRESIDENT ANDREW BENJAMIN SHEPHERD.SHEPHERD's walking with his personal assistant, JANIE, a shy,
	professional and incredibly efficient 25-year-old.JANIEThe 10:15 event's been moved inside
		to the Indian Treaty Room.SHEPHERD(to Janie)
		The 10:15 is American Fisheries?JANIEYes, sir. They're giving you a
		200-pound halibut.SHEPHERDJanie, make a note. We need to
		schedule more events where somebody
		gives me a really big fish.

	JANIE starts to make a note.JANIEYes, sir.SHEPHERDJanie, I was kidding.JANIEOf course, sir.SHEPHERD(to the AGENT at the
		        elevator)
		Hey, Cooper.AGENT COOPER'Morning, Mr. President.

	SHEPHERD and JANIE enter the elevator. As the doors close...JANIEMr. Rothschild asked to have a moment
		with you this morning.SHEPHERDIs he upset about the speech last night?JANIEHe seemed concerned.SHEPHERDWell, it wouldn't be a Monday morning
		unless Lewis was concerned about
		something I did Sunday night.

	The elevator doors open, revealing LEWIS ROTHSCHILD. At 32,
	LEWIS is the President's chief domestic policy advisor. It
	would appear that he averages about two hours sleep a night,
	though that doesn't seem to slow him down.LEWISYou skipped the whole paragraph.SHEPHERD(to Janie)
		And Monday morning it is.

	LEWIS falls into the pace as the three of them head for the
	double doors leading to the South Lawn.LEWIS"American can no longer afford to
		pretend that they live in a great
		society"...and then nothing. You
		dumped the whole handguns paragraph.SHEPHERDThis is a time for prudence, Lewis.LEWISThat was the kick-ass section.

	The three of them are now OUTSIDE and making their way down
	the COVERED WALKWAY that runs from the East Wing to the West
	Wing.SHEPHERDI thought what with being the
		President and all...LEWISSir, of course I didn't mean to
		imply--SHEPHERDI thought you'd be turning cartwheels
		this morning, Lewis -- 63 percent job
		approval.LEWISThat's great news, sir, but...

	They walk past a GROUNDKEEPER who's at work at a patch of grass.GROUNDKEEPER'Morning, Mr. President.

	Before he's even completed the last syllable of the greeting,
	JANIE quickly and quietly said--JANIECharlie.SHEPHERD'Morning, Charlie.LEWISSir, the press is gonna need an
		explanation.SHEPHERDFor what?

	SHEPHERD, LEWIS and JANIE walk through the door being held
	open by an AGENT. The conversation continues as they make
	their way through the corridors ofINT. THE WEST WING - DAYThey walk quickly down a hallway teeming with STAFFERS, AIDESAND OFFICE WORKERS.LEWISBecause you dropped the whole kick-ass
		section, now we've got this thing hanging
		out there.SHEPHERDThere's a thing hanging out there?LEWIS"Americans can no longer afford to
		pretend that they live in a great
		society." Then ...nothing. No
		explanation. No context. So now it's
		just this thing.SHEPHERDAnd it's hanging out there?LEWISYes, sir.

	SHEPHERD stops at an open doorway, calls to a STAFFER--SHEPHERDMaria--STAFFER (MARIA)Good morning, sir.SHEPHERDDid they tell you I'm gonna need--STAFFER (MARIA)--overall consumer spending and not
		just first homes. Yes, sir. We'll have
		it for you in 15 minutes.SHEPHERDThanks.

	SHEPHERD moves on. LEWIS and JANIE stay with him.LEWISMr. President, I really feel we need
		to focus on...SHEPHERDLewis, however much coffee you drink
		in the morning, I want you to reduce it
		by half.LEWISI don't drink coffee.SHEPHERDThen hit yourself over the head with
		a baseball bat, would you please?

	Another STAFFER crosses their path--JANIEHappy birthday, Laura.SHEPHERDHey, Laura, happy birthday.STAFFER (LAURA)Thank you, sir.

	Once out of earshot--SHEPHERD(to JANIE)
		I should send her some flowers.JANIEYou already did, sir.

	And, with that, they walk through a doorway and intoINT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAYIn the OUTER OFFICE, MRS. CHAPIL, the President's secretary,
	is hard at work on a word processor. She stands as SHEPHERD
	walks in--MRS. CHAPILGood morning, Mr. President.SHEPHERDHow're you, Mrs. Chapil?MRS. CHAPILFine, thank you, sir. Mr. Kodak left
		the detailed breakdown of the approval
		poll for you. He seemed to indicate that
		it was very good news.SHEPHERDSixty-three percent of it, at any rate.

	And by now they're in the OVAL OFFICE itself. SHEPHERD has
	gone to his desk and is looking over the various overnight
	briefing memos that have been left for him. As someone used
	to doing six things at once, he has no trouble reading,
	listening, and talking at the same time.MRS. CHAPILLucy called just a moment ago. You
		forgot to sign her permission slip
		for her class--JANIE--the museum trip. I'll go get it.SHEPHERD(to JANIE)
		What time does she get home today?JANIEThree-twenty.SHEPHERDHow's my afternoon look?JANIEVery crowded.SHEPHERDSchedule some time for me at 3:30.WOMAN (O.S.)Buenos dias, Senor Presidente.

	This from ROBIN McCALL, a strikingly tall black woman and the
	President's press secretary, as she strides into the room.SHEPHERDToo-tall McCall, how was Mexico?ROBINI didn't truly appreciate it until I
		came back and discovered that America
		isn't a great society.LEWIS(to ROBIN)
		He dumped a whole section.SHEPHERDNow there's a thing hanging out there.ROBINNot a great society, sir?SHEPHERDWell, with you out of the country, it
		wasn't, Robin. Now that you're back,
		we're great again.ROBINThere's a press room full of people
		saying "What did he mean by that?"LEWISSee?SHEPHERD(re: a memo he's been
			    looking at)
		A.J., did you get one of these?

	This is said to A. J. MACINERNEY as he walks through a
	separate entrance on the left side of the room. In addition
	to being the President's Chief of Staff and closest advisor,
	he's the President's closest and oldest friend.A.J.Is that the letter from Solomon at
		the GDC?SHEPHERDIt would appear to be a letter from
		the entire environmental community.
		These people are outta control.A.J.I think they're just frustrated,
		Mr. President.ROBINAre they blaming the President for
		global warming?A.J.Well, they don't think he caused it,
		if that's what you mean.

			   (continuing;
			    to SHEPHERD)
		Sir, I'm on the phone with these
		people twice a week. I honestly
		don't know what they want at this
		point.LEWISWhat they want is a 20 percent reduction in
		fossil fuel emissions.A.J.It won't pass at 20 percent.LEWISWe haven't really tried.A.J.Lewis, McSorley, McCluskey and Shane
		hold too many markers. If we try to
		push this through and lose, there will
		be a very loud thud when we hit the
		ground, and that's not what you want in
		an election year.SHEPHERDTalk to the GDC again, A.J. Tell them
		the President resents the implication
		that he's turned his back on the
		environment. Tell them I'll send 455 to
		the floor. But we're gonna ask for a
		10 percent reduction. If they want to pull
		their support, fine. At 63 percent job
		approval rating. I don't need their help
		getting a bill passed. We gotta get going--
		where's Leon?A.J.(to an AIDE)
		Would you call Mr. Kodak and tell him
		the President's--

	A.J.'s sentence is cut short by the sound of a head-on
	pedestrian collision in the outer office--MRS. CHAPIL (O.S.)Aaagh!KODAK (O.S.)Sorry! Sorry, my fault.A.J.(to the AIDE)
		Never mind.

	LEON KODAK comes into the oval office. The White House
	pollster is a likable, if clumsy, numbers whiz. He, along
	with A.J., LEWIS, and ROBIN, are regarded as the President's
	Starting Team. The people in this room have grown very close
	over the past few years.KODAKExcuse me. Good morning, Mr. President.SHEPHERDYou all right?KODAKThey keep moving that big ficus plant.A.J.We're all here, Mr. President.SHEPHERDOkay. First, I wanted to say
		congratulations. Three years ago, we
		were elected to the White House by
		one of the narrowest margins in history,
		and today Kodak tells us 63 percent of
		registered voters think we're doing a
		good job.KODAKWait a second. You wanted me to poll
		registered voters?

	Everyone LAUGHS... even SHEPHERD smiles...SHEPHERDBut the poll also tells us what we
		already knew: We don't get this
		crime bill of ours through Congress
		and these numbers are gonna be a
		memory. So, starting today, we're
		shifting it into gear.ROBINCan I tell my morning press gaggle
		that gun control--A.J.Crime control, Robin. Gun control
		means we're wimps and we're soft on
		crime.LEWISHang on, are we not--A.J.Lewis--LEWISAre we not putting back the handgun
		restrictions?!A.J.We're leaving 'em out.LEWISSir, we campaigned on this issue.
		Now, I understand we took it out when
		we were in the low forties, but we
		can push it through now.SHEPHERDAfter the elections.LEWISSir, we may never have an opportunity
		like this again. Let's take this 63
		percent out for a spin and see what
		it can do.SHEPHERDWe can't take it out for a spin, Lewis.
		We need it to get re-elected. For
		reasons passing understanding, people
		do not relate guns to gun-related crime.A.J.Robin, you can brief the press this
		afternoon. As of today, the crime
		bill's priority one on the President's
		domestic agenda.ROBINGot it.A.J.Leon, you're gonna run the war room.
		We're gonna need detailed projections
		for all the target districts by the
		end of the week. And, Leon, don't be
		a nice, sweet guy from Brooklyn. Do
		what the N.R.A. does.KODAKScare the shit out of 'em?A.J.Yeah.KODAKI can do that.A.J.Lewis, we want you to be legislative
		liaison on this. You're gonna run
		the show on the hill.LEWISCan I just say, to return to the
		subject for one moment, that it might
		be easier to fight a war on drugs if
		we weren't arming drug dealers.

	SHEPHERD responds a little too quickly -- we see a spark of a
	temper.SHEPHERDLewis, we've gotta fight the fights
		we can win.LEWISYes, sir.A.J.We want to announce the crime bill at
		the State of the Union, which is 72
		days from today. The last nose count
		put us 18 votes short.SHEPHERDEighteen votes in 72 days. Thank you,

		and burn plenty of fossil fuel. But if
		I had read these eight hundred pages,
		I would have discovered that it's the
		burning of fossil fuels that's been

		that the 20 percent reduction recommended
		by the GDC is a necessary first step
		toward arresting the catastrophic greenhouse
		effect that has gone unchecked by this

		was nothing more than vanity run amok.
		I was showing off for a colleague who
		doesn't think very much of me. It'd
		be a real injustice for you to hold the
		GDC accountable for my behavior today.

		State of the Union, I'll promise you
		full White House support.SYDNEYDo I have your word on that, sir?SHEPHERDAbsolutely. Listen, are you hungry?
		I skipped breakfast. You wanna have
		some coffee? A donut or something?SYDNEYSir, I'm a little intimidated by my
		surroundings, and yes, I've gotten
		off to a rocky and somewhat stilted
		beginning, but don't let that
		diminish the weight of my message:
		The GDC has been at every president
		for the last decade and a half that
		global warming is a calamity, the
		effects of which will be second only
		to nuclear war. The best scientists
		in the world have given you every
		reason to take the GDC seriously.
		But I'm gonna give you one more. If

		not so sure it's all right to burn a
		flag. I mean, it really bothers a lot
		of people, and I don't know why you
		think it's okay. I hear Senator
		Rumson talk, and some of the things
		he says sounds right to me, and I
		think, "God, am I like Bob Rumson?!
		I mean, Dad thinks he's a jerk. Dad
		hates this guy!
		Why am I agreeing with him" And then
		I think, "Well, maybe I'm not really
		like Bob Rumson, but maybe I'm not
		like Dad either." But the point is
		I'm the President's kid, and people
		pay attention to what I say, and if

		the more important question is why
		aren't you, Bob? This is an
		organization whose sole purpose is to
		defend the Bill of Rights, so it
		naturally begs the questions.SHEPHERD(continuing)
		Why would a senator, his party's most
		powerful spokesman and a candidate
		for president, choose to reject
		upholding the Constitution? If you
		can answer that question, then,
		folks, you're smarter than I am,
		because I didn't understand it until
		a couple of minutes ago. Everybody
		knows American isn't easy. America is
		advanced citizenship.SHEPHERD(continuing)
		You gotta want it bad, 'cause it's
		gonna put up a fight. It's gonna
		say, "You want free speech? Let's
		see you acknowledge a man whose words
		make your blood boil, who's standing
		center stage and advocating, at the
		top of his lungs, that which you
		would spend a lifetime opposing at the
		top of yours. You want to claim
		this land as the land of the free,
		then the symbol of your country can't
		just be a flag; the symbol also has
		to be one of its citizens exercising
		his right to burn that flag in
		protest." Show me that, defend that,
		celebrate that in your classrooms.
		Then you can stand up and sing about
		the land of the free. I've known Bob
		Rumson for years. I've been operating
		under the assumption that the reason
		Bob devotes so much time and energy to
		shouting at the rain was that he simply
		didn't get it. Well, I was wrong.SHEPHERD(continuing)
		Bob's problem isn't that he doesn't
		get it. Bob's problem is that he
		can't sell it. Nobody has ever won
		an election by talking about what I
		was just talking about.SHEPHERD(continuing)
		This is a country made up of people
		with hard jobs that they're terrified
		of losing. The roots of freedom are
		of little or no interest to them at
		the moment. We are a nation afraid
		to go out at night. We're a society
		that has assigned low priority to
		education and has looked the other
		way while our public schools have
		been decimated. We have serious
		problems to solve, and we need
		serious men to solve them. And
		whatever your particular problem is,
		friend, I promise you, Bob Rumson is
		not the least bit interested in
		solving it. He is interested in two
		things and two things only: Making
		you afraid of it and telling you
		who's to blame for it. That, ladies
		and gentlemen, is how you win
		elections. You gather a group of
		middle-aged, middle-class, middle-
		income voters who remember with
		longing an easier time, and you talk
		to them about family and American
		values and personal character. Then
		you have an old photo of the
		President's girlfriend. You scream
		about patriotism and you tell them
		she's to blame for their lot in life,
		you go on television and you call her
		a whore. Sydney Ellen Wade has done
		nothing to you, Bob. She has done
		nothing but put herself through law
		school, prosecute criminals for five
		years, represent the interests of
		public school teachers for two years,
		and lobby for the safety of our
		natural resources.SHEPHERD(continuing)
		You want a character debate? Fine,
		but you better stick with me, 'cause
		Sydney Ellen Wade is way out of your
		league. I've loved two women in my
		life. I lost one to cancer, and I
		lost the other 'cause I was so busy
		keeping my job I forgot to do my job.
		Well that ends right now.SHEPHERD(continuing)
		Tomorrow morning the White House is
		sending a bill to Congress for its
		consideration. It's White House
		Resolution 455, an energy bill
		requiring a 20 percent reduction of the
		emission of fossil fuels over the
		next ten years. It is by far the
		most aggressive stride ever taken in
		the fight to reverse the effects of
		global warming. The other piece of
		legislation is the crime bill. As of
		today it no longer exists. I'm
		throwing it out. I'm throwing it out
		and writing a law that makes sense.
		You cannot address crime prevention
		without getting rid of assault
		weapons and handguns.
		I consider them a threat to national
		security, and I will go door to door
		if I have to, but I'm gonna convince
		Americans that I'm right, and I'm
		gonna get the guns. We've got
		serous problems, and we need serious
		men, and if you want to talk about
		character, Bob, you'd better come at
		me with more than a burning flag and
		a membership card. If you want to
		talk about character and American
		values, fine. Just tell me where and

		insensitive about some personal...SHEPHERDNo, you were right. Two hundred and
		sixty-four million people don't give
		a damn about my life.LEWISJust so you know I've never been one
		of them, Mr. President.ROBINThis way, people. Let's go.SHEPHERD(to LEWIS)
		See you after.

	The PEOPLE in the room start to gather their things and exit,
	ROBIN handling any and all last-minute "Mr. President"'s as
	she herds people out the door.

	LUCY walks past SHEPHERD. She holds SHEPHERD's old tattered
	textbook and has it opened to a specific page...SHEPHERD(continuing)
		Whatcha got there, Luce?LUCYArticle 2, Section 3, of the U.S.
		Constitution. Executive Powers.
			   (reading)
		"He shall, from time to time, give to
		the Congress information of the State
		of the Union, and recommend to their
		consideration such measures as he
		shall judge necessary and expedient."A.J.Sounds right up your alley.

	SHEPHERD looks at his old friend and extends his hand for a
	deeply-felt handshake. A.J. grasps SHEPHERD's hand and then
	pulls him into a strong embrace.

	A.J. whispers a shout into SHEPHERD's ear--A.J.(continuing)
		Give 'em hell, Andy.

	A.J. pulls away, leaving SHEPHERD to enjoy the moment without
	having to speak--A.J.(continuing)
		You've got 30 seconds, Mr. President.SHEPHERDThank you.
			   (to LUCY)
		I'll see you afterward. I want a
		critique.

	The room clears out...revealing SYDNEY, dressed like the
	First Lady she's soon to be, sitting against the window sill.SHEPHERD(continuing)
		There's been something I've been
		trying to give you since our first
		date. I tried a bunch of times, but
		somehow I've always managed to trip
		over my job.
			   (beat)
		Anyay...

	SHEPHERD has picked his black canvas gym bag with the gold
	Presidential seal.

	He reaches in the bag and pulls out a bouquet of flowers.SHEPHERD(continuing)
		These are for you.SYDNEYThey're beautiful.

	JANIE pokes her head in.JANIEMr. President?SHEPHERDGotta go.SYDNEYShould I stay here?SHEPHERDNo, walk with me.

	They exit into a hallway lined with Congressional STAFFERS,
	SECRET SERVICE, CAPITOL SECURITY, WHITE HOUSE STAFF, and,
	most prominently, A.J., LEWIS, ROBIN, JANIE and KODAK.

	SYDNEY is still clutching her flowers as they near the double
	doors to the House Chamber--SYDNEYHow'd you finally do it?SHEPHERD(raising his voice
			    above the cheering)
		Do what?SYDNEYManage to give a woman flowers and
		be President at the same time.SHEPHERDWell...it turns out I've got a rose
		garden.

	SYDNEY is stopped in her tracks as--

	--the doors to the Chamber fly open--DOORKEEPERMr. Speaker!!!...THE PRESIDENT OF THEUNITED STATES!!!The CHAMBER leaps to its feet in a thunderous ovation,
	shouts of "Bravo!" from the gallery...

	At the back, LEWIS and ROBIN and KODAK are trying to maintain
	their professional cool, but it's a moment impossible not to
	get caught up in...SYDNEY is clutching her flowers with both
	hands...SHEPHERD is making his way down the aisle, shaking
	hands and receiving congratulations and good wishes, and weFADE OUT.--------------------------------------------------------------
