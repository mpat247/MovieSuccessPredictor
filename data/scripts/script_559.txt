It's been cleaved nearly in half by the BROADSWORD that still juts hilt-first from the base of the splintered front panel.  PHOTO ALBUMS and leather-bound DIARIES have been shredded and scattered across the floor----except for several selected PHOTOGRAPHS, skewered onto the sword tip like a Medieval message spike. Rachel struggles to breathe. Like she's taken that sword in her own gut.INSIDE THE CABINET A TELEVISION flickers with videotape of GRAINY HOME MOVIES.

It's taunting her.Gathering up the photos and hugging them to her breast, Rachel slowly approaches the phone.  Any second now, you'd expect it to stop ringing, nobody home. But  whoever's on the other end knows better. It keeps right on RINGING. Insistant.  Trembling fingers reach out for the receiver.

Connor betrays no emotion. Heather looks on in horror.HEATHERMy God, what are they?CONNORFarm animals. Dead of the plague.HEATHERWhy do they torment us with their dead cattle?(no response)Connor...?CONNORThey think I've brought this upon them.

He's gross, corpulent and perpetually short of breath. A nasty NOSE BOIL figures prominently in his overall appearance.VILLAGERS of varying stripe crowd nervously behind them.FATHER RAINEYIn the name of the Holy See and the rule of law, you are hereby charged, Connor MacLeod, with heresy and the practice of black magic.(turns to the villagers)Take him.The townsmen jostle in place, each trying to squeeze backward behind the other.FATHER RAINEY (cont'd)(squints)Heresy is not contagious.Two of the bolder men move forward, gripping Connor by the elbows.
Once its clear they haven't sucked up any demons, the others SWARM HIM.EXT - STONE HUT - NIGHTCaiolin SCREAMS as Connor's dragged outside and driven to the ground by a relentless battery of sticks and clubs.CUT TO:INT - STONE CELL - NIGHTConnor stirs awake in a centuries-old dungeon, a dark hole, crumbling and damp.VOICES seem to drip through the porous mortar. Taunting, vengeful, expectant.He crosses to the barred window that affords him a narrow, ground-level view of THE TOWN COMMONS  where a well-attended EXECUTION is now underway.Connor squints, craning to make out the identity of the condemned.TOWNSPEOPLE mingle and mill in front of him, obstructing his line-of-sight.Even as A FAMILIAR VOICE rises above the surrounding chatter.JACOB KASE'S VOICEThe curse that afflicts one generation will invariably pass its mark onto the next. The ties of blood cannot be severed by word or deed, if in fact your blood is that of your son.Several villagers STEP ASIDE to reveal:CONNOR'S MOTHER bound to an UPRIGHT STAKE atop a mound of shorn timber. CONNOR siezes with the impossible horror of recognition.CONNORNo.. . NO! !JACOB KASE Makes the sign of the cross as he reads from a writ of
execution. He stands atop a primeval CELTIC MONOLITH worn down to the form of a pedestal. Father Rainey wobbles behind him, sniffing ammonia to spell his chronic angina.KASEThrough the infinite compassion of our Lord God, you are entitled one final opportunity to renounce all that is unholy, to declare Connor MacLeod not of your loins and help put an end to the darkness that has been cast upon this land. How say you, Caiolin MacLeod?Caiolin lifts her head, pale and beatific.CAIOLINIf your god should persecute me into the next world, then I shall simply have to find myself another.Shocked murmers of outrage shudder through the crowd.
Kase steps up and RIPS AWAY Caiolin's cherished silver CRUCIFIX, with its distinctive wooden Christ figure.KASE(holding up Caiolin's crucifix)You won't need this where you're going.CONNOR grabs at the iron window-bars. Shakes them until the mortar chips from their moorings. THE RUDDY-FACED EXECUTIONER solemnly approaches Caiolin. Unseen by the bloodlusting crowd, he takes out a small leather sack and drapes it around her neck by the drawstring. He tucks it under her coarse woolen robe and pats it flush against her chest.EXECUTIONER(softly)Black powder. It will make short work of your suffering.Caiolin nods.  He steps down off the pyre. Reaches for a BURNING TORCH. CONNOR strains against the bars like a madman. Mortar continues crumbling until one bar actually RIPS AWAY COMPLETELY.  THE EXECUTIONER touches torch to kindling. It ALIGHTS.  CONNOR tries to squeeze through the window gap. Too tight. So he winds back with the iron bar and swings with mindless fury. Iron strikes unyielding stone, SPARKING and CHIPPING...THE PYRE BENEATH CAIOLIN ENGULFS IN FLAME. Heat ripples her face, distorts her body. CONNOR hammers harder, quicker, louder. Bits of stone fly everywhere. But the bulk of it remains spitefully intact. Still, it's enough to convince ALL FOUR GUARDS to intervene. They throw open the heavy iron door and descend upon Connor with swords and axes. >Wielding the iron bar like a battle mace, Connor splits the first guard's head, catches his sword mid-air and slices into the next. Third guard's axe catches on a ceiling beam. Connor runs him through like an overstuffed feedsack.The fourth guard drops his sword and BOLTS.THE PYRE is now fully ABLAZE. Caiolin looks out through the rippling wall of flame.... . . and smiles weakly.CAIOLINMy water horse...AS CONNOR splits the crowd like a battering ram. He reaches the pyre, hurling flaming timbers aside with his bare hands. Initially stunned, the townsfolk shrink back, watching Connor desperately scatter the fire.  Caiolin buries her face in her shoulder, biting back the agony as...Sword in hand, Connor stretches upward, hacking away the ropes that bind her, oblivious to the fire now crawling in serpentine coils around his own arms and legs.  Freed of the ropes, Caiolin begins to slump forward.  Connor grabs for her arm as THE BLACK POWDER EXPLODES in a CONCUSSION of FIRE that renders any further hope of rescue futile.Connor stands atop the burning pyre, wicked tongues of flame leaping off his back and shoulders like fiery wings.  He throws back his head and HOWLS to the heavens.  Fire dances across Connor's skin and clothing as he raises his broadsword and steps down into the crowd.PANDEMONIUM breaks out. This isn't just a common witch. This is one of Hell's very own.  Those few foolish enough to attack are cut down where they stand.  The rest scatter in mindless PANIC. Father Rainey blocks Connor's path. Lifts his cross.... . . as he's CUT DOWN by the blind SLASH of Connor's sword. Connor steps over Rainey's body and keeps coming, driving the mob fleeing into their dwellings.  Kase crouches blustering over Rainey.KASEFather... Father, please--(tries to staunch the bleeding)Father--!Rainey's eyes open slightly.RAINEYWho are you...?KASEYour son. It's your son-- Jacob.Rainey stares back as if a veil has suddenly been lifted. And what he now sees terrifies him to death.RAINEY(eyes widen)Who are YOU?KASEI'm your--He stops. Rainey's eyes are frozen. Dead.CONNOR returns to the flaming pyre, refueling his rage with the
sight of his mother's blackened corpse. >KASEscoops up a discarded sword, leaps to his feet and CHARGES CONNOR, bellowing like a madman.  >Connor whirls around with his sword, making Kase IMPALE HIMSELF on  the blade. Kase stares wide-eyed and gagging at Connor's smoldering visage-- the depthless black pools of hate that shroud his eyes. It's the last thing Jacob Kase will ever see.  Connor opens his fingers and lets him DROP, the sword hilt still jutting from Kase's chest.  Gathering up several chunks of flaming timber, Connor HEAVES them onto the straw-covered rooftops, setting them instantly ABLAZE.  In short order, the village is transformed into a giant swirling INFERNO.  Silhouetted against the crimson sky, Connor lifts Caiolin's body and turns his back on Glenfinnan for the last time.DISSOLVE TO:EXT - ANCIENT STONE MONASTERY - NIGHTStanding outside the massive door is a MONK clad in dark, hooded monastic garb. Nothing in the panorama would suggest we've just jumped four  centuries into an uncertain future...  Until--A PACK OF MOTORCYCLISTS  chew their way up the rubbled slope. Fishtail to a stop.

Monk levels his gun and BLOWS the Jamaican right off his feet.  And sure enough, he GAGS before his next trigger-pull. A very nasty SERRATED BLADE retracts into a wooden hilt. Monk drops in a heap as his assailant, a WIRY ASIAN, turns for the door, joined by the others.  IN THE VERY NEXT INSTANT the heavy oak-and-iron door SWINGS OPEN with a BARRAGE of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE--The intruders are CUT DOWN where they stand. THREE MORE HOODED MONKS appear in the doorway, wielding ASSAULT RIFLES. They grimly regard the bodies.MONK #1Take the heads.

only a brief glimpse of a PRIEST�S COLLAR. Guard #l whips his rifle toward the Stranger. Stranger diverts it with the tip of his sword. Bullets go nowhere. One slash and the guard is gone. Two more slashes and his comrades fall.  Stranger kicks the body of the dead Jamaican as he steps through the open doorway.STRANGERDon�t be long.INT - MONASTERY - NIGHTFOLLOW THE STRANGER through a maze of chambers and DOWN into serpentine catacombs.  He KICKS THROUGH a DOOR into AN INNER ROOM cavernous and dripping, where even the air seems septic. A few dim candles illuminate A DOZEN MEN bound to complicated, almost Giger-esque chairs. Arms, legs and faces have been immobilized by crossing flats of metal BOLTED into flesh and wood. From the wild overgrowth of hair and beard, and the impossibly long, curled fingernails, it's a good guess none of them have moved a muscle in years.Except for a pale CUSTODIAN standing in a corner, trembling silently.  Stranger stands at the threshold, his face obscured by flickering shadows. He scans the living corpses.STRANGERSo it's true.He moves slowly among them.STRANGER (cont'd)What sacrifices they made of you all. Warehoused, like rotting pieces of meat.He pauses to lift up a downcast head. Gazes into the shackled face. The eyes are covered by strips of rusted
iron, the face by tangled beard.STRANGER (cont'd)Tell me-- is this the better way? I'm sure you've had some time to reflect on it.One by one, THE RECENTLY-DEAD INTRUDERS filter into the room, led by the Jamaican. Blood stipples their clothes, streaks their faces. But they are, in every other sense, fully-restored.Stranger straightens, swivels around to the terrified Custodian. Custodian backpeddles into the wall.STRANGERWhich one is Connor MacLeod?CUSTODIANI-- I don't know... They never told me names...STRANGER(low, seething)Don't. Lie. To. Me.CUSTODIANI swear.

I don't even care about these other pathetic souls you lock away as a barrier to the Prize.The Custodian stares back, uncomprehending.STRANGER (cont'd)(squeezes his throat)I want Connor MacLeod. Give me MacLeod and I'll leave. And you can go right on pretending that what you do here actually matters.The custodian lifts a shaking finger.

The price is unimaginably high, but you are, for all practical purposes, protected from the violence within yourself. It's called The Sanctuary.DUNCANI don't understand.METHOSThink of those Buddhist monks who came to cherish life so much that to step on a single insect, to harm a blade of grass was a violation of their creed. They placed themselves into an extreme form of protective custody. A sanctuary of sorts.(beat)What I'm talking about is something similar. But one that doesn't allow for a change of heart.He opens his fingers and watches his cup plummet to the plaza below.

Windows boarded, shreds of flapping police tape, the investigators have long since come and gone.INT - ANTIQUE STOREDoor SPLINTERS OPEN. Duncan steps inside. In the aftermath of the firebombing, nothing has been
spared. Rachel and Connor's richly-cultivated collection has been reduced to a bitter moonscape. One can only shudder at the degree of overkill that went into this attack. Duncan climbs the back stairs to THE SECOND FLOOR LOFT which is even worse. Ash and cinder are virtually all that remain of Connor's home.
Pausing at the far wall, Duncan yanks down an old charred tapestry, revealingAN INNER DOORdeliberately hidden from view. He dips down, retrieves a key from under a loose floorboard and opens the heavily- reinforced door.ENTERING he finds himself in a LARGE CIRCULAR ROOM surrounded by a staggering display of ARTIFACTS drawn from centuries of personal history. We're looking at the sum total of Connor MacLeod's existance, stacked floor to ceiling.Duncan moves among the mementos, smiles as he lifts them; an old Scottish coin, pocket flask... a faded PHOTO of himself in a World War I uniform.
He pauses at a painting of Connor's wife HEATHER, radiant in simple peasant garb, smiling serenely across the ages.
Finally, a tarnished epee that he wields with instant familiarity.TRANSITION TO:INT - FENCING ACADEMY, RAVENNA ITALY (1627) - DAYDuncan's LUNGE misses Connor by a mile. He stumbles upright in a grand hall streaked by SUNLIGHT from floor- to-ceiling windows.  Duncan and Connor face off with duelling swords, sporting black waistcoak andd knee breeches in the manner of the times.  Several other elegant FENCING PAIRS spar in this most genteel version of the ancient bloodsport, a far cry from the corpse-littered battlefield seen earlier.  A little mustachioed PUFFER darts between the duellists with lint brush, pail and towel as Connor and Duncan re- engage in a rapid series of strikes and parries.CONNORYou've improved greatly.DUNCANYou really think so?Connor executes a simple combination that sends'Duncan's sword flying one way, his body the other.CONNORNo. I'm just being gracious.Duncan recovers, sets his feet. Puffer skitters over, brushes the dust off Duncan's coat, dabs his sweat and puffs the back of his hair. Duncan swats him away. They take en-garde position. Connor points his blade.CONNOR (cont'd)Remember, you're only immortal as long as your head remains attached to those shoulders.Duncan lunges again. Misses and hits the deck.CONNOR (cont'd)Which in your case might not be long at all.He puts his blade to Duncan's neck. Humor evaporates.CONNOR (cont'd)What we give up to our adversary in defeat, Duncan... is evervthinq.Duncan stares up at him, uncomprehending.CONNOR (cont'd)We call it "The Quickening"-- our strength, our knowledge, our life essence-- it all flows into the victor, feeds him, makes him stronger, in ways you can't possibly comprehend. It's what drives other Immortals to kill us. And what forces us to be better-- smarter-- than the rest.He takes Duncan by the arm, jerks him to his feet.CONNOR (cont'd)Survival. Learn it.Duncan goes on the attack. What he lacks in technique, he makes up for in determination. Almost. Connor sidesteps Duncan's next lunge, swats his blade flat across Duncan's ass and sends him plowing face-first into the floor. Duncan re-engages Connor in fighting stance. Puffer races up behind Duncan again, meticulously dusts his backside. Reaches around and plucks an unsightly piece of lint off his crotch with thumb and forefinger.DUNCAN(whirls around)You mind?!Connor clucks his tongue.CONNOR (cont'd)Allow me.He squares Duncan�s shoulders and steps back. Considers.CONNOR (cont'd)Unh uh.He steps up and swivels Duncan around until he�s facing the opposite way.CONNOR (cont'd)If you should ever again find yourself backside to a blade... just keep this in mind.He proceeds to take Duncan through a move that's dazzling in it's inherent simplicity-- a move that winds up with Duncan's blade whisking perilously close across Connor's throat.CONNOR (cont'd)It's a coup de fin.He catches Duncan's sword-fist in his own, holds it immobile.CONNOR (cont'd)Properly executed, even you cannot prevent your blade from finding its mark.DUNCANProperly executed, we'll never have this talk again.Duncan and Connor's eyes lock. They break.TRANSITION BACK TO:INT - CIRCULAR ROOMDuncan suddenly SIEZES UP with a strange disquiet and ringing in the ears known as THE BUZZ.

He's the one who followed Duncan through customs.As he reaches to cinch closed one of the iron cuffs with a thick metal dowel, he reveals a distinctive TATTOO across his inner forearm. One that Duncan instantly recognizes. _DUNCANWatchers?Matthew simply nods.DUNCANWatchers observe. They don't interfere.MATTHEWTrue. And we were more than happy to perform our traditional function.

Holds it to
Duncan's lips like the final offering to a condemned man.MATTHEW (cont'd)Worse still, far worse, is that he's become a perversion to the Game. And if he prevails, that perversion will resonate through everything we know. For eternity. In ways we can't possibly comprehend.Duncan tugs at his bonds.

Duncan grabs his arm.DUNCANNot here.CONNORWalk away, Duncan.Kase and Faith continue toward them. Connor's rage seems to ratchet up with every step.DUNCANYou're on holy ground.

All the while Kase addresses Connor, Faith never takes her eyes off Duncan.KASE (cont'd)But if you think it ends here, my ancient friend, you're wrong. Very... Very... Wrong.Kase turns back to Faith. Pulls his sword and without
warning SLICES it across her throat.

They reach aRIVERBANKwhere a YOUNG WOMAN and her elderly CONSORT are detained at a crude wooden TOLL GATE.
Eight or nine disreputable-looking HIGHWAYMEN surround their carriage.

He has the most teeth.CONNORWhat's going on?HIGHWAYMANThe lady here refuses to pay her toll.CONNORToll for what?HIGHWAYMANPassage over the bridge.Connor cranes his eyes, upriver and down.CONNORI see no bridge.HIGHWAYMANWhat do you think pays for the bridge?Connor considers, then turns back to the lady with a
shrug.CONNORThe man has a point.Despite her sweeping auburn hair and natural beauty, we now recognize the young woman as FAITH from an earlier era.

They�ve preyed upon us three years running.CONNORThis true?HIGHWAYMANA good sturdy bridge is not an overnight accomplishment, Sir.CONNORExactly what, may I ask, have you accomplished so far?HIGHWAYMAN(proudly)The tollgate.Duncan trots around the tollgate and up alongside Connor. He leans over to the highwayman.DUNCANExcuse me, but by whose authority do you act?HIGHWAYMAN(holds up scroll)By deed of the King.DUNCANMight I see that?Highwayman slowly unravels the parchment scroll. The nearly-illegible scrawl suggests random words copied by an illiterate.DUNCAN (cont'd)Does the King always sign his name with an "X"?Highwayman's cronies reach for their swords.HIGHWAYMANHe was in a hurry.All eyes hover on Duncan's reaction. Two of the highwaymen edge around behind Catherine and her elderly consort, ready to gut them both at a moment's notice.Duncan tracks them with his eyes.DUNCAN(nods)Busy man, the King.(to Catherine)I suggest you pay the gentlemen and be on your way.CATHERINEHis deed is a fake!DUNCANThat's a matter of opinion.CATHERINEYou, Sir, are no better than they!DUNCANThat's also a matter of opinion.(to Connor)Shall we?Connor sizes up his young protege'. Gives a dubious nod.CONNORLead on.CATHERINEYou can't just leave!DUNCANYou're right...He tosses a handful of gold coins to the Highwayman.DUNCAN (cont'd)Good luck with the bridge.He kicks his horse into a brisk trot. Connor reluctantly follows suit.
They cross the river through ankle-deep water.CONNORI can't believe you gave those bastards your money.DUNCANIt wasn't my money.Duncan pulls a cinched canvas BAG overstuffed with coins from his overcoat.DUNCAN (cont'd)It was theirs.RACK FOCUS TO the duped HIGHWAYMEN scrambling onto their horses and riding hard in frantic pursuit.
They hit the river at a gallop, kicking up giant shimmering fantails of water.DUNCAN (cont'd)By the time they reach us, the young lady and her escort should be safely out of harm�s way.The pursuers close the gap in seconds.
Connor grins approvingly. Draws his sword and glances
over at Duncan.CONNORShall we?Duncan FLICKS his own sword, lets the hilt auto-rotate around his open palm and snaps it vertical. He nods back at Connor.DUNCANLet's.Together, they whirl around to face the onrushing horde.THEY BATTLEin the middle of the shallow river. Nine maniacal thieves against two sporting Immortals.
The spray of water, the slashing of swords and the pounding of hooves all build to an operatic crescendo.
Duncan's improved since Ravenna. He easily scatters three of his adversaries before engaging the blood-crazed LEADER.
This time it's Connor who finds himself in trouble. He tumbles from his horse and goes down, losing his sword in the river.DUNCANsuddenly winds back and FLINGS his sword at his opponent like a throwing dagger.BLADEwhistles past the dumbstruck highwayman's head. Which was not the intended target.... . .as we discover when we follow it's end-over-end

Even now, you're afraid you'll lose. That's your true fear isn't it?(whispers low, seductive)Oh, it's not the dying, my friend. I know that. That would be a blessing.

Making me even stronger by it.One look in Connor's eyes and you know he's right.KASE (cont'd)What's wrong?(almost a purr)Don't you want to be inside me?Connor slowly LOWERS his sword...and FLICKS Kase's discarded sword back up into his hands.Kase simply smiles and takes position.Duncan can only look on helplessly as Kase takes the first offensive, driving Connor backward with dazzling -- almost casual-- swordplay.KASEI've taken more heads than you can possibly imagine.His sword whistles across Connor's face, opens a THREE
INCH GASH over his eye.KASE (cont'd)Do you really want a taste of all those accumulated quickenings?Connor stumbles backward again, blinded by his own dripping blood. Knows beyond a shadow of a doubt he's doomed.
Duncan knows it too. And it's killing him to watch.
Still Connor won't go down easy.
He manages a brief offensive, walking Kase backward on his toes.
Kase puts one hand behind his back, fencing-style, and goes to work on Connor's torso, crosshatching him in blood.
Connor lunges wildly. Kase parries effortlessly.
Kase now opens up a BLINDING BARRAGE on Connor. It's like duelling against lightning, so quick and unpredictable are Kase's strikes.
Constantly off balance, Connor still manages to NICK Kase in the cheek.KASE (cont'd)(touches scratch)I'd almost forgotten what that felt like. Thank you.He now turns it on full. Drives Connor up against a wall and pins him with his swordtip.
His eyes go impossibly cold.KASEI want you to think back to this moment in the endless nights ahead. And know that every time you close your eyes, from now to eternity, I'll be there.(beat)Ripping apart the ones you care about most.He removes his sword and steps back.KASE (cont'd)It's not over, Connor MacLeod. It will never, never be over.He turns and walks back toward the church.
Duncan does not step aside to let him pass-- their shoulders bump.KASE (cont'd)You, on the other hand, are on borrowed time.He continues on, past the other Immortals who have gathered to watch the unfolding spectacle.
One-by-one, they turn and file back into the church behind Kase.
Connor stares into Duncan's eyes as if wanting to say something. Can't.
Instead, he turns and starts limping out across the empty lot.
Feeling the presence of another Immortal, Duncan slowly looks over atFAITHwho stands at a distance. Watching him.As their eyes meet, she, too, turns and melts back into the surrounding blackness.TRANSITION TO:EXT - DUBLIN ROWHOUSE (17TH CENTURY) - DAYA BEARDED BRAWLER

It's the BUZZ of another Immortal.
He spins to a stop as his eyes come to rest onCONNOR MACLEODwho enters the room on a wave of silence.
Duncan breaks away from Kate, crosses over to Connor and wraps him in a bear hug.DUNCANAbout time. I was beginning to wonder.CONNORI was on a junk in the South China Sea when I got your notice. 12 hours ago.DUNCANHow...?CONNORDon't ask.Kate spins by on the arm of a new partner.KATEYou're next, Connor MacLeod.CONNORThat better be no idle threat.Duncan watches Kate with a rapturous smile.DUNCANWell, I finally did it!CONNORSo it would appear.DUNCANWhat do you think of her?CONNORYou know that's not an easy answer.The edge in his voice is not lost on Duncan.CONNOR (cont'd)Outside.EXT - PORCH - NIGHTConnor stands with Duncan at the railing, staring out into the encroaching night.CONNORYou know she's like us.DUNCANYes. I sensed it the day we met her.CONNORSo you know that, like us, her immortality can only be triggered by the shock of a violent death.Duncan looks off, as if purging the thought from his head.CONNOR (cont'd)It's what makes warriors of us all, Duncan. Good or bad, there seems a purpose to it.DUNCANYes. And without such a death, she'll simply grow old and die like any other. Is that what you dragged me out here to tell me?Connor removes a uniquely-braided GOLDEN ROPE from his vest pocket.
It catches the candlelight with the glint of a thousand silken threads as he runs it lightly over his fingertips.CONNORMany years after I was married, I came home to find Heather sitting on a stool in the kitchen, with a knife in one hand... and her hair in the other.FLASH TO:HEATHER, early-forties, her hair shorn to the scalp.

They never do when it involves themselves.DUNCANThen I can do nothing.CONNORShe's in the flower of her youth. Enjoy the moment and let it pass.

It WIDENS to REVEAL THE SILHOUETTE OF A WOMAN.
Duncan closes his eyes. Feigns sleep.
She pads silently inside. Pulls the door closed.
Duncan remains still, breathing heavily.
The woman steals slowly up to the bedside. Pauses, as if quietly studying Duncan----then swings her leg up and straddles him.
Even in the murky halflight, he can still make out the familiar painted eyes framed by a tangle of bleached hair.
She says nothing, her expression lost under a veil of darkness. Only her rapid breathing betrays her tension.
Instead, she suddenly leans forward and KISSES HIM.

Releasing the wheel, he stands in his seat, lifts his arms above his head and SHOUTS in exultation as----the car EXPLODES into the wall.
It's all over in a breath. Accordioned metal, drooling radiator, and Faith, slumped over the dash.
Kase lies sprawled and battered on the pavement, thrown some distance from the wreckage. He's clearly taken the worst of the impact.FAITHstirs and slowly wrenches herself free of the smoking mangle of steel and plastic.
She reaches back and pulls Kase's sword free of the wreckage.
With single-minded determination, she limps over to Kase's body, face-up in his own pooling blood.
A disbelieving PEDESTRIAN pauses in shock.
Faith gives her a twisted smile.FAITHDon't mind us.Pedestrian SCURRIES OFF as Faith lifts the sword over her head and brings it WHISTLING DOWN across Kase's neck.
With inhuman reflexes, Kase awakens and catches her wrist in the same heartbeat.
Eyes narrow.KASEDoes this mean it's over?DISSOLVE TO:EXT - KASE'S CHURCH - DAYKase steps up to the back entrance, alone.
THE DOOR hangs slightly ajar, which clearly disturbs him.INT - CHURCH SANCTUARY - DAYKase enters the main room to find Calvin and Sarge asleep on their pews. He kicks the first pew, awakens both with a start.KASEWho left the back door open?CALVINHuh?Kase looks to Sarge.SARGEI dunno.KASEWhere's Cracker Bob? He was supposed to be watching the back.Calvin and Sarge both shrug.KASE (cont'd)(sotto)Infants.He whirls, stalks out.INT - SACRISTYKase enters his dark, cluttered office, SLAMMING the door behind him.FLICKS ON THE LIGHTand stops cold.A SWORDJUTS from a small wooden table.... . . right through CRACKER BOB, who lies skewered to the tabletop.WRAPPED AROUND THE SWORDHILTis Caiolin MacLeod�s unique silver-and-wood CRUCIFIX.
The message is not lost on Kase.BOB'S EYESsuddenly flutter open. First thing he sees is that sword hilt sticking rudely out of his own chest.CRACKER BOBAh-- Ahhh-- AHHHHHHH!!KASEShut up.He reaches forward and JERKS the sword out of Bob, and with itA SINGLE SCRAP OF PAPERimpaled on the blade.
It bears just one word, scrawled in Bob's plentiful blood.GLENFINNANBob sits up on the table, wild-eyed, as Kase calmly opens his fingers and lets the paper slide from his fingers.CUT TO:EXT - LITTLE ITALY, ESTABLISHING - NIGHTGlitter lights and milling tourists. Row upon row of gimmicky Italian restaurants.INT - ITALIAN RESTAURANT, PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHTJacob Kase and his acolytes dine at a long table set against a gaudy backdrop of faux Roman ruins, babbling fountains and plastic holly.
It all imparts a whiff of "Last Supper" pomp to the proceeding.
Which is not lost on the other Immortals, who glance around warily while eating, as suspicious of each other as they are of Kase.
Nor does anyone miss the fact that there are no windows in this particular room.CLOSE ON WINSTON
He stares into his pasta, beading sweat.BENEATH THE TABLEhis fingers curl around the cold steel of a .38 SPECIAL wedged between his knees. He inches the gun upward toward the table rim as...
Kase suddenly stands up in the center.KASEA toast...All heads turn.Gun freezes in Winston's lap, just hidden from view.KASE (cont'd)I see tonight as a celebration of the spirit.(raises his glass)Here's to all of you who continue tostand by me...(smiles at Winston). . . even those who might waver at times.Winston stiffens, fears that Kase is on to him.
And when Calvin averts his gaze, he knows.
Still, he raises his glass. As do the others.KASE (cont'd)You are my flock. You nourish my soul.It's now or never for Winston. His moment of truth.
Kase's eyes slowly drift over to meet his.SLOW MOTION,Kase tips back his glass and drinks, eyes locked on Winston.
Winston responds in kind, gulping down his wine as he slips the gun back into his pocket.
He shoves off from the table.WINSTONExcuse me.KASEWhere you going?WINSTONToilet.KASESit sit. I'm not through with my toast yet.WINSTONCan't wait.He angles for the door.KASEI'm almost finished. Sit.Winston reaches for the doorknob. Locked.
He swivels back. Sees death in Jacob Kase's eyes. His death.KASE (cont'd)It'll all be over in a few more seconds.A cold spike of fear shoots through every single one of them.... . . as Kase continues.KASE (cont'd)You�ve all been a part of a great quest. A four hundred year quest for justice.He lifts up an exquisitely-crafted sword.KASE (cont'd)And here, my friends, is the instrument of that justice. It's called the "Colichmarde." Finest sword known to man.The blade WHISTLES upright.KASE (cont'd)Blessed by Popes and baptized in blood. I only break it out for special occasions.He kisses the perfect cross formed by the juncture of blade and quillons.KASE (cont'd)It sings like an angel. Just listen.Winston jerks for his gun.
In a SUDDEN BLUR of STEEL and BLOOD, Kase beheads Winston and dispatches the next two of his stunned acolytes with blinding efficiency.
TONGUES OF LIQUID ENERGY coil up and around Kase's body. But he keeps right on coming.
The others scatter like roaches.
ESSENCE PULSES off walls and ceiling, SHATTERING STATUARY, HURLING FURNITURE.... ..before MERGING with the WALKING INFERNO that is now Jacob Kase.
His sword BLAZES through the remaining victims, trailing STREAKS OF BLUE FIRE.

disappears from sight.
A LOW SCRAPING OF METAL ON STONE taunts him from
somewhere out there in the slow-drifting whiteness
Kase's sword TWITCHES toward the SOUND.
Just the FAINTEST OUTLINE of a FIGURE COALESCES BRIEFLY inside the fog.KASEAh, what's this? Hamlet's ghost?The FIGURE melts back into silent nothingness.KASE (cont'd)I'm afraid even the cloak of fog won't help you overcome a sizeable disadvantage.A DIFFERENT SCRAPING SOUND
spins him around to seeANOTHER GHOSTLY FIGURElooming over him from a narrow stone outcropping.
Kase masks a slight tinge of concern.KASE (cont'd)It's always good to see two fellow clansmen banded together in a common cause. But I hope you haven't sunk to the level of a simultaneous ambush.Once again, the figure steps backward into the enveloping
fog. Disappears.
Slightly unnerved, Kase jerks around. No sign of anyone. Just that infernal mist.
A SOFT SCRAPING of SWORD against ROCK swivels him back around to his original position.CLOSE ON KASE
His nerves are starting to shred.
He turns several full rotations, craning for a glimpse of his tormentors.
And then he sees it...AN APPARITION WIELDING A SWORD.Kase LUNGES for it. And this time, it doesn't retreat.
Swords CLANG in thunderous overture asTWO SPECTRES IN THE FOGbattle for position on tenuous footing.
KASE drives his adversary backward into a BLUNTED STONE WALL, leaving him no avenue of escape.
Their swords LOCK UP and Kase suddenly finds himself FACE TO FACE WITH--DUNCAN MACLEOD.
You can sense Kase's bitter disappointment.KASENot at all who I'd hoped for.CLOSE ON DUNCAN'S EYES
as they flick to a point iust behind Kase's head.CLOSE ON KASE'S EYES
as he realizes he's been had.
He SWINGS FULLY AROUND TO FACE CONNOR----and sees that NOBODY'S THERE!
Too late-- he SWINGS BACK TO DUNCAN-- and IMPALES HIMSELF ON DUNCAN'S SWORD.DUNCAN(through clenched teeth)I'm afraid Connor couldn't be here. But don't worry, he's with us in spirit.Still gripping his sword two-fisted, Duncan seems to surge with newfound strength.DUNCANHe gave himself for this moment. And I shan't let him down.Duncan SHOVES OFF from Kase and goes to work on him with a VENGEANCE.WHAT KASE SEES:A frightening, hallucinitory vision of a DUAL ADVERSARY-- one that CHANGES back and forth in the flux of swirling mist.
As Duncan's blade BLURS PAST, Kase sees CONNOR. With the very next SWING, he sees Duncan again.
Then Connor. Then Duncan. Connor. Duncan...
Kase rubs his eyes with the back of his hand. Shakes it off. Can't be.
Duncan buffets Kase backward with several dazzling combinations, then goes inside, tough and ugly.
Kase seems suddenly overwhelmed, physically and mentally, as he's driven onto his back by sheer relentless overdrive.
Duncan SLASHES DOWN for the killing blow, which Kase BARELY DEFLECTS.
He SLASHES AGAIN. And AGAIN. Each time Kase barely escapes with his head intact.
Duncan keeps up this relentless barrage, hacking down in every conceivable direction, looking for an opening, finding none.
With each increasingly-leaden DOWNSTROKE, Duncan is losing strength.... . . and Kase is regaining his.
Kase BATTLES BACK TO HIS FEET, deftly siezes the advantage.KASE(savage smile)This is not a game won on points, I'm afraid.He drives Duncan back with an answering exchange that leaves no doubt of his superior ability.
In a single massive THRUST, Kase STRIPS Duncan's sword and sends him flying.
Duncan lands on his back, weaponless.
Kase steps up to the katana, scoops his toe under it and FLICKS IT BACK TO DUNCAN.
Then waves him back to his feet. A cat playing with his prey.
Both combatants square off... and RESUME.KASEThat's the beauty of eternity. The fun never stops.He THRUSTS-- spiking Duncan clear through the shoulder.
Duncan hangs up on the blade, unable to move. Grimaces
in pain.
Setting boot to chest, Kase KICKS Duncan off his sword and sends him spiralling backward.
Duncan reaches out to break his fall----but there's no ground beneath him.
He PLUMMETS OFF a SLANTED CLIFF. Bounces at fifty feet, then tumbles clear to the bottom.
Kase steps up to the edge, scowls.A FRESHLY-CUT QUARRYhas been hewn from the hilltop by the massive sword of modern technology.
EARTH MOVING EQUIPMENT several stories tall lines the inner basin.KASEWhat have they done to my mountain?!He gazes down at DUNCAN'S BODY sprawled at the base of the cliff. Then starts down after him.EXT - BOTTOM OF QUARRY - DAYDuncan crawls over to his sword.... . . as Kase picks his way down the steep incline.
Duncan spikes his sword into the ground and uses it to climb upright.
One look at his battered body and you know this fight is over. He just stands there, hunched over his sword, grimly waiting for Kase to reach him and deliver the killing blow.
It doesn't take long. Kase stops, regards him with
contempt.KASEDon't make it easy. I hate that.DUNCANYou�re breaking my heart.KASEPick up!Duncan shakes his blood-streaked head.KASEPICK UP!DUNCANIt's always been too easy for you, Kase. No reason this time should be any different.He plucks his sword out of the ground.... . . and TURNS HIS BACK TO KASE.DUNCAN (cont'd)Take your best shot.He hobbles off, sword hanging limp at his side.
Kase starts TREMBLING WITH RAGE.KASEMACLEOD!Duncan ignores him, keeps walking.
About now, we should have a pretty good idea what Duncan has in mind.
But Kase doesn't have a clue.DUNCAN'S POV:For a fleeting moment, Connor stands before Duncan, more
mist than flesh.
He opens his arms wide.CONNOR'S APPARITIONRemember weil, old friend.
He DISSOLVES AWAY as Kase hoists sword over shoulder...KASE (cont'd)MAC-LEOD!!. ..and CHARGES...Which is exactly what Duncan expected.USING THE SAME MOVE CONNOR TAUGHT HIM----Duncan PIVOTS WITH the THRUST, catching Kase completely off guard and off balance.
This time, no force of man or nature can keep Duncan's sword from hitting home.
He SLICES UPWARD with a ROAR OF DEFIANCE.... ..and FOLLOWS THROUGH.ON KASE:He stands there, head miraculously still intact, a look of bewildered relief.
Duncan simply POPS his sword butt into Kase's face.
The head comes easily away from the neck and falls.KASE'S POV spins END OVER END through the air, bounces twice and comes to a rest SIDEWAYS.
And that's how we first see his HEADLESS BODY, sprawled across the ground.KASE'S SEVERED HEADblinks with sudden recognition. And now he knows. This is the worst part of losing your head-- those last few seconds of cold lucidity.DUNCAN

The SEISMIC CONVULSIONS GRADUALLY SUBSIDE.
The dust settles.
And the blighted landscape falls into an unearthly SILENCE, blind to its own buried secrets.
HOLD on the trailing wisps of smoke asTHE GROUND SHUDDERSand DUNCAN'S KATANA BREAKS THE SURFACE.
It PLUNGES UPWARD ONE, TWO, THREE MORE TIMES, pulverizing dirt and stone.
HANDS FOLLOW, clawing their up way through the loosely- mounded earth until DUNCAN'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS APPEAR.
As if the earth itself is giving birth to a new generation of Immortal.
He rolls out onto the ground, gasping, triumphant. Reborn.
One inch at a time, he slowly rises to his feet.
