               At the left and in the immediate foreground a semaphore 
               traffic signal stands at GO. Approaching it at about thirty 
               miles per hour is a Dodge 1938 coupe. It is driven erratically 
               and weaving a little, but not out of control.

               When the car is about forty feet away, the signal changes to 
               STOP. Car makes no attempt to stop but comes on through.A-2 A LIGHT NEWSPAPER TRUCKis crossing the intersection at right angles. It swerves and 
               skids to avoid the Dodge, which goes on as though nothing 
               had happened. The truck stops with a panicky screech of tires. 
               There is a large sign on the truck: "READ THE LOS ANGELES 
               TIMES". The truck driver's infuriated face stares after the 
               coupe.A-3 THE COUPEcontinues along the street, still weaving, then slows down 
               and pulls over towards the curb in front of a tall office 
               building.A-4 THE COUPEstops. The headlights are turned off. For a second nothing 
               happens, then the car door opens slowly. A man eases himself 
               out onto the sidewalk and stands a moment leaning on the 
               open door to support himself. He's a tall man, about thirty-
               five years old. From the way he moves there seems to be 
               something wrong with his left shoulder.

               He straightens up and painfully lowers his left hand into 
               his jacket pocket. He leans into the car. He brings out a 
               light-weight overcoat and drapes it across his shoulders. He 
               shuts the car door and walks toward the building.A-5 ENTRANCE OF THE BUILDINGAbove the closed, double-plate glass doors is lettered: 
               "PACIFIC BUILDING". To the left of entrance there is a 
               drugstore, closed, dark except for a faint light in the back. 
               The man comes stiffly up to the doors. (CAMERA HAS MOVED UP 
               WITH HIM). He tries the doors. They are locked. He knocks on 
               the glass. Inside, over his shoulder, the lobby of the 
               building is visible: a side entrance to the drugstore on the 
               left, in the rear a barber shop and cigar and magazine stand 
               closed up for the night, and to the right two elevators. One 
               elevator is open and its dome light falls across the dark 
               lobby.

               The man knocks again. The night watchman sticks his head out 
               of the elevator and looks toward entrance. He comes out with 
               a newspaper in one hand and a half-eaten sandwich in the 
               other. He finishes the sandwich on the way to the doors, 
               looks out and recognizes the man outside, unlocks the door 
               and pulls it open.NIGHT WATCHMANHello there, Mr. Neff.

               Neff walks in past him without answering.A-6 INT. LOBBYNeff is walking towards elevator. Night watchman looks after 
               him, relocks door, follows to elevator. Neff enters elevator.A-7 ELEVATORNeff stands leaning against wall. He is pale and haggard 
               with pain, but deadpans as night watchman joins him.NIGHT WATCHMANWorking pretty late aren't you, Mr. 
                         Neff?NEFF(Tight-lipped)
                         Late enough.NIGHT WATCHMANYou look kind of all in at that.NEFFI'm fine. Let's ride.

               Night watchman pulls lever, doors close and elevator rises.NIGHT WATCHMANHow's the insurance business, Mr. 
                         Neff?NEFFOkay.NIGHT WATCHMANThey wouldn't ever sell me any. They 
                         say I've got something loose in my

                         Uh-huh.

               Night watchman looks around at him, turns away again and the 
               elevator stops.NIGHT WATCHMAN(Surly)
                         Twelve.

               The door opens. Across a small dark reception room a pair of 
               frosted glass doors are lettered: PACIFIC ALL-RISK INSURANCE 
               COMPANY - FOUNDED 1906 - MAIN OFFICE. There is a little light 
               beyond the glass doors.

               Neff straightens up and walks heavily out of the elevator, 
               across reception room to doors. He pushes them open. The 
               night watchman stares after him morosely, works lever, 
               elevator doors start to close.A-8 TWELFTH FLOOR INSURANCE OFFICE(Note for set-designer: Our Insurance Company occupies the 
               entire eleventh and twelfth floors of the building. On the 
               twelfth floor are the executive offices and claims and sales 
               departments. These all open off a balcony which runs all the 
               way around. From the balcony you see the eleventh floor below: 
               one enormous room filled with desks, typewriters, filing 
               cabinets, business machines, etc.)

               Neff comes through the double entrance doors from the 
               reception room. The twelfth floor is dark. Some light shines 
               up from the eleventh floor. Neff takes a few steps then holds 
               on to the balcony railing and looks down.A-9 THE ELEVENTH FLOOR FROM ABOVE - NEFF'S POINT OF VIEWTwo colored women are cleaning the offices. One is dry-mopping 
               the floor, the other is moving chairs back into position, 
               etc. A colored man is emptying waste baskets into a big square 
               box. He shuffles a little dance step as he moves, and hums a 
               little tune.A-10 NEFFMoves away from the railing with a faint smile on his face, 
               and walks past two or three offices (CAMERA WITH HIM) towards 
               a glass door with number twenty-seven on it and three names: 
               HENRY B. ANDERSON, WALTER NEFF, LOUIS L. SCHWARTZ. Neff opens 
               the door.A-11 INT. NEFF'S OFFICE - DARKThree desks, filing cabinets, one typewriter on stand, one 
               dictaphone on fixed stand against wall with rack of records 
               underneath, telephones on all three desks. Water cooler with 
               inverted bottle and paper cup holder beside it. Two windows 
               facing toward front of building. Venetian blinds. No curtains. 
               Waste basket full, ash trays not emptied. The office has not 
               been cleaned.

               Neff enters, switches on desk lamp. He looks across at dicta 
               phone, goes heavily to it and lifts off the fabric cover. He 
               leans down hard on the dictaphone stand as if feeling faint. 
               He turns away from dictaphone, takes a few uncertain steps 
               and falls heavily into a swivel chair. His head goes far 
               back, his eyes close, cold sweat shows on his face. For a 
               moment he stays like this, exhausted, then his eyes open 
               slowly and look down at his left shoulder. His good hand 
               flips the overcoat back, he unbuttons his jacket, loosens 
               his tie and shirt. This was quite an effort. He rests for a 
               second, breathing hard. With the help of his good hand he 
               edges his left elbow up on the arm-rest of the chair, supports 
               it there and then pulls his jacket wide. A heavy patch of 
               dark blood shows on his shirt. He pushes his chair along the 
               floor towards the water cooler, using his feet and his right 
               hand against the desk, takes out a handkerchief, presses 
               with his hand against the spring faucet of the cooler, soaks 
               the handkerchief in water and tucks it, dripping wet, against 
               the wound inside his shirt. Next, he gets a handful of water 
               and splashes it on his face. The water runs down his chin 
               and drips. He breathes heavily, with closed eyes. He fingers 
               a pack of cigarettes in his shirt pocket, pulls it out, looks 
               at it. There is blood on it. He wheels himself back to the 
               desk and dumps the loose cigarettes out of the packet. Some 
               are blood-stained, a few are clean. He takes one, puts it 
               between his lips, gropes around for a match, lights cigarette. 
               He takes a deep drag and lets smoke out through his nose.

               He pulls himself toward dictaphone again, still in the swivel 
               chair, reaches it, lifts the horn off the bracket and the 
               dictaphone makes a low buzzing sound. He presses the button 
               switch on the horn. The sound stops, the record revolves on 
               the cylinder. He begins to speak:NEFFOffice memorandum, Walter Neff to 
                         Barton Keyes, Claims Manager. Los 
                         Angeles, July 16th, 1938. Dear Keyes: 
                         I suppose you'll call this a 
                         confession when you hear it. I don't 
                         like the word confession. I just 
                         want to set you right about one thing 
                         you couldn't see, because it was 
                         smack up against your nose. You think 
                         you're such a hot potato as a claims 
                         manager, such a wolf on a phoney 
                         claim. Well, maybe you are, Keyes, 
                         but let's take a look at this 
                         Dietrichson claim, Accident and Double 
                         Indemnity. You were pretty good in 
                         there for a while, all right. You 
                         said it wasn't an accident. Check. 
                         You said it wasn't suicide. Check. 
                         You said it was murder. Check and 
                         double check. You thought you had it 
                         cold, all wrapped up in tissue paper, 
                         with pink ribbons around it. It was 
                         perfect, except that it wasn't, 
                         because you made a mistake, just one 
                         tiny little mistake. When it came to 
                         picking the killer, you picked the 
                         wrong guy, if you know what I mean. 
                         Want to know who killed Dietrichson? 
                         Hold tight to that cheap cigar of 
                         yours, Keyes. I killed Dietrichson.

                         Yes, I killed him. I killed him for

               He interrupts the dictation, lays down the horn on the desk. 
               He takes his lighted cigarette from the ash tray, puffs it 
               two or three times, and kills it. He picks up the horn again.NEFF(His voice is now

                          It began last May. About the end of 
                         May, it was. I had to run out to 
                         Glendale to deliver a policy on some 
                         dairy trucks. On the way back I 
                         remembered this auto renewal on Los 
                         Feliz. So I decided to run over there. 
                         It was one of those Calif. Spanish 
                         houses everyone was nuts about 10 or 
                         15 years ago. This one must have 
                         cost somebody about 30,000 bucks -- 
                         that is, if he ever finished paying 
                         for it.

               Spanish style. Some kids throwing a baseball back and forth

               along the block. Neff's coupe meets and passes the ice cream 
               wagon and stops before one of the Spanish houses. Neff gets 
               out. He carries a briefcase, his hat is a little on the back

               He goes through the archway. Maid goes off the other way.A-25 LIVING ROOMNeff comes into the room and throws his briefcase on the 
               plush davenport and tosses his hat on top of it. He looks 
               around the room, then moves over to a baby grand piano with 
               a sleazy Spanish shawl dangling down one side and two cabinet 
               photographs standing in a staggered position on top. Neff 
               glances them over: Mr. Dietrichson, age about fifty-one, a 
               big, blocky man with glasses and a Rotarian look about him; 
               Lola Dietrichson, age nineteen, wearing a filmy party dress 
               and a yearning look in her pretty eyes. Neff walks away from 
               the piano and takes a few steps back and forth across the 
               rug. His eyes fall on a wrinkled corner. He carefully 
               straightens it out with his foot. His back is to the archway 
               as he hears high heels clicking on the staircase. He turns 
               and looks through the arch.NEFF'S VOICEThe living room was still stuffy 
                         from last night's cigars. The windows 
                         were closed and the sunshine coming 
                         in through the Venetian blinds showed 
                         up the dust in the air. The furniture 
                         was kind of corny and old-fashioned, 
                         but it had a comfortable look, as if 
                         people really sat in it. On the piano, 
                         in couple of fancy frames, were Mr. 
                         Dietrichson and Lola, his daughter 
                         by his first wife They had a bowl of 
                         those little red goldfish on the 
                         table behind the davenport, but, to 
                         tell you the truth, Keyes, I wasn't 
                         a whole lot interested in goldfish 
                         right then, nor in auto renewals, 
                         nor in Mr. Dietrichson and his 
                         daughter Lola. I was thinking about 
                         that dame upstairs, and the way she 
                         had looked at me, and I wanted to

                         You see what I mean, Walter?NEFFSure. I've got good eyesight. You 
                         want him to have the policy without 
                         him knowing it. And that means without 
                         the insurance company knowing that 
                         he doesn't know. That's the set-up, 
                         isn't it?PHYLLISIs there anything wrong with it?NEFFI think it's lovely. And then, some

                         little help. They can't quite make

               strike against the glass. He turns away impatiently, paces 
               up and down past a caddy bag with golf clubs in it, pulls 
               one out at random, makes a couple of short swings, throws 
               the club on the couch, paces again.NEFF'S VOICE(Continuing)
                         It had begun to rain outside and I 
                         watched it get dark and didn't even 
                         turn on the light. That didn't help 
                         me either. I was all twisted up 
                         inside, and I was still holding on 
                         to that red-hot poker. And right 
                         then it came over me that I hadn't 
                         walked out on anything at all, that 
                         the hook was too strong, that this 
                         wasn't the end between her and me. 
                         It was only the beginning.

               The doorbell rings.NEFF'S VOICE(Continuing)
                         So at eight o'clock the bell would 
                         ring and I would know who it was 
                         without even having to think, as if 
                         it was the most natural thing in the 
                         world.

               Neff goes to the door and opens it.PHYLLISHello.

               Neff just looks at her.PHYLLISYou forgot your hat this afternoon.

               She has nothing in her hands but her bag.NEFFDid I?

               He looks down at her hands.PHYLLISDon't you want me to bring it in?NEFFSure. Put it on the chair.

               She comes in. He closes the door.NEFFHow did you know where I live?PHYLLISIt's in the phone book.

               Neff switches on the standing lamp.PHYLLISIt's raining.NEFFSo it is. Peel off your coat and sit 
                         down.

               She starts to take off her coat.NEFFYour husband out?PHYLLISLong Beach. They're spudding in a 
                         new well. He phoned he'd be late. 
                         About nine-thirty.

               He takes her coat and lays it across the back of a chair.PHYLLISIt's about time you said you're glad 
                         to see me.NEFFI knew you wouldn't leave it like 
                         that.PHYLLISLike what?NEFFLike it was this afternoon.PHYLLISI must have said something that gave 
                         you a terribly wrong impression. You 
                         must surely see that. You must never 
                         think anything like that about me, 
                         Walter.NEFFOkay.PHYLLISIt's not okay. Not if you don't 
                         believe me.NEFFWhat do you want me to do?PHYLLISI want you to be nice to me. Like 
                         the first time you came to the house.NEFFIt can't be like the first time. 
                         Something has happened.PHYLLISI know it has. It's happened to us.NEFFThat's what I mean.

               Phyllis has moved over to the window. She stares out through 
               the wet window-pane.NEFFWhat's the matter now?PHYLLISI feel as if he was watching me. Not 
                         that he cares about me. Not any more. 
                         But he keeps me on a leash. So tight 
                         I can't breathe. I'm scared.NEFFWhat of? He's in Long Beach, isn't 
                         he?PHYLLISI oughtn't to have come.NEFFMaybe you oughtn't.PHYLLISYou want me to go?NEFFIf you want to.PHYLLISRight now?NEFFSure. Right now.

               By this time, he has hold of her wrist. He draws her to him 
               slowly and kisses her. Her arms tighten around him. After a 
               moment he pulls his head back, still holding her close.NEFFHow were you going to do it?PHYLLISDo what?NEFFKill him.PHYLLISWalter, for the last time --

               She tries to jerk away but he holds her and kisses her again.NEFFI'm crazy about you, baby.PHYLLISI'm crazy about you, Walter.NEFFThat perfume on your hair. What's 
                         the name of it?PHYLLISSomething French. I bought it down 
                         at Ensenada.NEFFWe ought to have some of that pink 
                         wine to go with it. The kind that 
                         bubbles. But all I have is bourbon.PHYLLISBourbon is fine, Walter.

               He lets her go and moves toward the dinette.A-45 THE DINETTE AND KITCHENIt contains a small table and some chairs. A low glass-and-
               china cabinet is built between the dinette and kitchen, 
               leaving a space like a doorway. The kitchen is the usual 
               apartment house kitchen, with stove, ice-box, sink, etc. It 
               is quite small.

               Neff goes to the ice-box and Phyllis drifts in after him.NEFFSoda?PHYLLISPlain water, please.NEFFGet a couple of glasses, will you.

               He points at the china closet. He has taken a tray of ice 
               cubes from the refrigerator and is holding it under the hot-
               water faucet.NEFFYou know, about six months ago a guy 
                         slipped on the soap in his bathtub 
                         and knocked himself cold and drowned. 
                         Only he had accident insurance. So 
                         they had an autopsy and she didn't 
                         get away with it.

               Phyllis has the glasses now. She hands them to him. He dumps 
               some ice cubes into the glasses.PHYLLISWho didn't?NEFFHis wife.

               He reaches for the whiskey bottle on top of the china closet.NEFFAnd there was another case where a 
                         guy was found shot and his wife said 
                         he was cleaning a gun and his stomach 
                         got in the way. All she collected 
                         was a three-to-ten stretch in 
                         Tehachapi.PHYLLISPerhaps it was worth it to her.

               Neff hands her a glass.NEFFSee if you can carry this as far as 
                         the living room.

               They move back toward the living room.A-46 LIVING ROOMPhyllis and Neff go toward the davenport. She is sipping her 
               drink and looking around.PHYLLISIt's nice here, Walter. Who takes 
                         care of it for you?NEFFA colored woman comes in twice a 
                         week.PHYLLISYou get your own breakfast?NEFFOnce in a while I squeeze a 
                         grapefruit. The rest I get at the 
                         corner drugstore.

               They sit on the davenport, fairly close together.PHYLLISIt sounds wonderful. Just strangers 
                         beside you. You don't know them. You 
                         don't hate them. You don't have to 
                         sit across the table and smile at 
                         him and that daughter of his every 
                         morning of your life.NEFFWhat daughter? Oh, that little girl 
                         on the piano.PHYLLISYes. Lola. She lives with us. He 
                         thinks a lot more of her than he 
                         does of me.NEFFEver think of a divorce?PHYLLISHe wouldn't give me a divorce.NEFFI suppose because it would cost him 
                         money.PHYLLISHe hasn't got any money. Not since 
                         he went into the oil business.NEFFBut he had when you married him?PHYLLISYes, he had. And I wanted a home. 
                         Why not? But that wasn't the only 
                         reason. I was his wife's nurse. She 
                         was sick for a long time. When she 
                         died, he was all broken up. I pitied 
                         him so.NEFFAnd now you hate him.PHYLLISYes, Walter. He's so mean to me. 
                         Every-time I buy a dress or a pair 
                         of shoes he yells his head off. He 
                         won't let me go anywhere. He keeps 
                         me shut up. He's always been mean to 
                         me. Even his life insurance all goes 
                         to that daughter of his. That Lola.NEFFNothing for you at all, huh?PHYLLISNo. And nothing is just what I'm 
                         worth to him.NEFFSo you lie awake in the dark and 
                         listen to him snore and get ideas.PHYLLISWalter, I don't want to kill him. I 
                         never did. Not even when he gets 
                         drunk and slaps my face.NEFFOnly sometimes you wish he was dead.PHYLLISPerhaps I do.NEFFAnd you wish it was an accident, and 
                         you had that policy. For fifty 
                         thousand dollars. Is that it?PHYLLISPerhaps that too.

               She takes a long drink.PHYLLISThe other night we drove home from a 
                         party. He was drunk again. When we 
                         got into the garage he just sat there 
                         with his head on the steering wheel 
                         and the motor still running. And I 
                         thought what it would be like if I 
                         didn't switch it off, just closed 
                         the garage door and left him there.NEFFI'll tell you what it would be like, 
                         if you had that accident policy, and 
                         tried to pull a monoxide job. We 
                         have a guy in our office named Keyes. 
                         For him a set-up like that would be 
                         just like a slice of rare roast beef. 
                         In three minutes he'd know it wasn't 
                         an accident. In ten minutes you'd be 
                         sitting under the hot lights. In 
                         half an hour you'd be signing your 
                         name to a confession.PHYLLISBut Walter, I didn't do it. I'm not 
                         going to do it.NEFFNot if there's an insurance company 
                         in the picture, baby. So long as 
                         you're honest they'll pay you with a 
                         smile, but you just try to pull 
                         something like that and you'll find 
                         out. They know more tricks than a 
                         carload of monkeys. And if there's a 
                         death mixed up in it, you haven't 
                         got a prayer. They'll hang you as 
                         sure as ten dimes will buy a dollar, 
                         baby.

               She begins to cry. He puts his arms around her and kisses 
               her.NEFFJust stop thinking about it, will 
                         you.

               He has hooked the wastebasket under his feet to sit more 
               comfortably. As he talks, a little cough shakes him now and 
               then.NEFFSo we just sat there, and she kept 
                         on crying softly, like the rain on 
                         the window, and we didn't say 
                         anything. Maybe she had stopped 
                         thinking about it, but I hadn't. I 
                         couldn't. Because it all tied up 
                         with something I had been thinking 
                         about for years, since long before I

                         Because you've got that wheel right

               across the window and opens it wide. He stands there, looking 
               down into the dark street. From below comes the sound of a 
               car starting and driving off. The rain drifts in against his 
               face. He just stands there motionless. His mind is going a 
               hundred miles a minute.FADE OUT:END OF SEQUENCE "A"SEQUENCE "B"FADE IN:B-1 INT. NEFF'S OFFICE - (NIGHT)Neff sits slumped in his chair before the dictaphone. On the 
               desk next to him stands a used record. The cylinder on the 
               dictaphone is not turning. He is smoking a cigarette. He 
               kills it then lifts the needle and slides off the record 
               which is on the machine and stands it on end on the desk 
               beside the other used record. He reaches down painfully to 
               take another record from the rack beneath the dictaphone, 
               looks at it against the light to make sure it has not been 
               used, then slides it into place on the machine and resets 
               the needle. He lifts the horn and resumes his dictation.NEFFThe first thing we had to do was fix 
                         him up with that accident policy. I 
                         knew he wouldn't buy, but all I wanted 
                         was his signature on an application. 
                         So I had to make him sign without 
                         his knowing what he was signing. And 
                         I wanted a witness other than Phyllis 
                         to hear me give him a sales talk. I 
                         was trying to think with your brains, 
                         Keyes. I wanted all the answers ready 
                         for all the questions you were going 
                         to spring as soon as Dietrichson was 
                         dead.

               Neff takes a last drag on his cigarette and kills it by 
               running it under the ledge of the dictaphone stand. He drops 
               the stub on the floor and resumes.NEFFA couple of nights later I went to 
                         the house. Everything looked fine, 
                         except I didn't like the witness 
                         Phyllis had brought in. It was 
                         Dietrichson's daughter Lola, and it 
                         made me feel a little queer in the 
                         belly to have her right there in the 
                         room, playing Chinese checkers, as 
                         if nothing was going to happen.DISSOLVE:B-2 A BOARD OF CHINESE CHECKERS CAMERA WITHDRAWS ANDGRADUALLY REVEALS THE DIETRICHSON LIVING ROOM - NIGHTThe checker-board is on the davenport between Phyllis and 
               Lola. Mr. Dietrichson sits in a big easy chair. His coat and 
               tie are over the back of the chair, and the evening paper is 
               lying tumbled on the floor beside him. He is smoking a cigar 
               with the band on it. He has a drink in front of him and 
               several more inside him. In another chair sits Neff, his 
               briefcase on the floor, leaning against his chair. He holds 
               his rate book partly open, with a finger in it for a marker. 
               He is going full swing.NEFFI suppose you realize, Mr. 
                         Dietrichson, that, not being an 
                         employee, you are not covered by the 
                         State Compensation Insurance Act. 
                         The only way you can protect yourself 
                         is by having a personal policy of 
                         your own.DIETRICHSONI know all about that. The next thing 
                         you'll tell me I need earthquake 
                         insurance and lightning insurance 
                         and hail insurance.

               Phyllis looks up from the checker-board and cuts in on the 
               dialogue. Lola listens without much interest.PHYLLIS(To Dietrichson)
                         If we bought all the insurance they 
                         can think up, we'd stay broke paying 
                         for it, wouldn't we, honey?DIETRICHSONWhat keeps us broke is you going out 
                         and buying five hats at a crack. Who 
                         needs a hat in California?NEFFI always say insurance is a lot like 
                         a hot water bottle. It looks kind of 
                         useless and silly hanging on the 
                         hook, but when you get that stomach 
                         ache in the middle of the night, it 
                         comes in mighty handy.DIETRICHSONNow you want to sell me a hot water 
                         bottle.NEFFDollar for dollar, accident insurance 
                         is the cheapest coverage you can 
                         buy, Mr. Dietrichson.DIETRICHSONMaybe some other time, Mr. Neff. I 
                         had a tough day.NEFFJust as you say, Mr. Dietrichson.DIETRICHSONSuppose we just settle that automobile 
                         insurance tonight.NEFFSure. All we need on that is for you 
                         to sign an application for renewal.

               Phyllis throws a quick glance at Neff. As she looks back she 
               sees that Lola is staring down at her wrist watch.LOLAPhyllis, do you mind if we don't 
                         finish this game? It bores me stiff.PHYLLISGot some thing better to do?LOLAYes, I have.

                         also told you we're going roller

               She goes out through the archway.DIETRICHSONA great little fighter for her weight.

               Dietrichson sucks down a big swallow of his drink.

               Neff has taken two blank forms from his briefcase. He puts 
               the briefcase on Mr. Dietrichson's lap and lays the forms on 
               top. Phyllis is watching closely.NEFFThis is where you sign, Mr. 
                         Dietrichson.DIETRICHSONSign what?NEFFThe applications for your auto 
                         renewals. So you'll be protected

                         North.

               Neff takes out his fountain pen.NEFFSan Francisco, Mr. Dietrichson?DIETRICHSONPalo Alto.PHYLLISHe was a Stanford man, Mr. Neff. And

                         a little fun even once a year?NEFFGreat football school, Stanford. Did 
                         you play football, Mr. Dietrichson?DIETRICHSONLeft guard. Almost made the varsity, 
                         too.

               Neff has unscrewed his fountain pen. He hands it to Mr. 
               Dietrichson. Dietrichson puts on his glasses.NEFFOn that bottom line, Mr. Dietrichson.

               Dietrichson signs. Neff's and Phyllis' eyes meet for a split 
               second.NEFFBoth copies, please.

               He withdraws the top copy barely enough to expose the 
               signature line on the supposed duplicate.DIETRICHSONSign twice, huh?NEFFOne is the agent's copy. I need it 
                         for my files.DIETRICHSON(In a mutter)
                         Files. Duplicates. Triplicates.

               Dietrichson grunts and signs again. Again Neff and Phyllis 
               exchange a quick glance.NEFFNo hurry about the check, Mr. 
                         Dietrichson. I can pick it up at

               Casually Neff lifts the briefcase and signed applications 
               off Dietrichson's lap.DIETRICHSONHow much you taking me for?NEFFOne forty-seven fifty, Mr. 
                         Dietrichson.

               Dietrichson stands up. He is about Neff's height but a little

                         one evening, Mr. Neff.DIETRICHSONPlenty.

               Dietrichson has poured some more whisky into his glass. He 
               tries the siphon but it is empty. He gathers up his coat and 
               tie and picks up his glass.DIETRICHSONGood night, Mr. Neff.

               Neff is zipping up his briefcase.NEFFGood night, Mr. Dietrichson. Good

               Dietrichson trundles off towards the archway.PHYLLIS(To Neff)
                         I think you left your hat in the 
                         hall.

               Phyllis leads the way and Neff goes after her, his briefcase 
               under his arm.B-3 HALLWAY DIETRICHSON RESIDENCE - (NIGHT)Phyllis enters through the living room archway with Neff 
               behind her. She leads him towards the door. On the way he 
               picks up his hat. In the BACKGROUND Dietrichson begins to 
               ascend the stairs, carrying his coat and glass. Phyllis and 
               Neff move close to the door. They speak in very low voices.PHYLLISAll right, Walter?NEFFFine.PHYLLISHe signed it, didn't he?NEFFSure he signed it. You saw him.

               Phyllis opens the door a crack. Both look at the stairs, 
               where Dietrichson is going up. Phyllis takes her hand off 
               the doorknob and holds on to Neff's arm.NEFF(Looking up)
                         Watch it, will you.

               Phyllis slowly drops her hand from his arm. Both look up as 
               Dietrichson goes across the balcony and out of sight.NEFFListen. That trip to Palo Alto When 
                         does he go?PHYLLISEnd of the month.NEFFHe drives, huh?PHYLLISHe always drives.NEFFNot this time. You're going to make

                         train.

               For a second they stand listening and looking up as if they 
               had heard a sound.PHYLLISIt's all right. Go on, Walter.NEFFLook, baby. There's a clause in every 
                         accident policy, a little something 
                         called double indemnity. The insurance 
                         companies put it in as a sort of 
                         come-on for the customers. It means 
                         they pay double on certain accidents. 
                         The kind that almost never happen. 
                         Like for instance if a guy got killed 
                         on a train, they'd pay a hundred 
                         thousand instead of fifty.PHYLLISI see.

                         Just the way you say. Straight down 
                         the line.

               They look at each other. The look is like a long kiss. Neff 
               goes out. Slowly Phyllis closes the door and leans her head 
               against it as she looks up the empty stairway.B-4 EXT. DIETRICHSON RESIDENCE - (NIGHT)Neff, briefcase under his arm, comes down the steps to the 
               street, where his Dodge coupe is parked at the curb. He opens 
               the door and stops, looking in.

               Sitting there in the dark corner of the car, away from the 
               steering wheel, is Lola. She wears a coat but no hat.LOLAHello, Mr. Neff. It's me.

               merchandise. Customers move around selecting articles and 
               putting them in their baskets. Phyllis is seen among them, 
               standing by the soap section. Her basket is partly filled.

                         got it in my pocket. I got his check 
                         too. I saw him down in the oil fields. 
                         He thought he was paying for the 
                         auto insurance. The check's just 
                         made out to the company. It could be 
                         for anything. But you have to send a 
                         check for the auto insurance, see. 
                         It's all right that way, because one 
                         of the cars is yours.PHYLLISBut listen, Walter ---NEFFQuick, open your bag.

               She hesitates, then opens it. Neff looks around quickly, 
               slips the policy out of his pocket and drops it into her 
               bag. She snaps the bag shut.NEFFCan you get into his safe deposit 
                         box?PHYLLISYes. We both have keys.NEFFFine. But don't put the policy in 
                         there yet. I'll tell you when. And 
                         listen, you never touched it or even 
                         saw it, understand?PHYLLISI'm not a fool.NEFFOkay. When is he taking the train?PHYLLISWalter, that's just it. He isn't

               He breaks off as a short, squatty woman, pushing a child in 
               a walker, comes into sight and approaches. She stops beside 
               Neff, who is pretending to read a label on a can. Phyllis 
               puts a few cakes of soap into her basket.WOMAN(To Neff)

               Keyes turns.NEFFI'm sorry, Keyes.KEYESWhat's the matter? The dames chasing 
                         you again? Or still? Or is it none 
                         of my business?NEFF(With a sour smile)
                         If I told you it was a customer --KEYESMargie! I bet she drinks from the 
                         bottle. Why don't you settle down 
                         and get married, Walter?NEFFWhy don't you, for instance?KEYESI almost did, once. A long time ago.

               Neff gets up from his desk.NEFFLook, Keyes, I've got a prospect to 
                         call on.

               Keyes drives right ahead.KEYESWe even had the church all picked 
                         out, the dame and I. She had a white 
                         satin dress with flounces on it. And 
                         I was on my way to the jewelry store 
                         to buy the ring. Then suddenly that 
                         little man in here started working 
                         on me.

               He punches his stomach with his fist.NEFFSo you went back and started 
                         investigating her. That it?

               Keyes nods slowly, a little sad and a little ashamed.KEYESAnd the stuff that came out. She'd 
                         been dyeing her hair ever since she 
                         was sixteen. And there was a manic-
                         depressive in her family, on her 
                         mother's side. And she already had 
                         one husband, a professional pool 
                         player in Baltimore. And as for her 
                         brother --NEFFI get the general idea. She was a 
                         tramp from a long line of tramps.

               He picks up some papers impatiently.KEYESAll right, I'm going. What am I to 
                         say to Norton? How about that job I 
                         want you for?NEFFI don't think I want it. Thanks, 
                         Keyes, just the same.KEYESFair enough. Just get this: I picked 
                         you for the job, not because I think 
                         you're so darn smart, but because I 
                         thought maybe you were a shade less 
                         dumb than the rest of the outfit. I 
                         guess I was all wet. You're not 
                         smarter, Walter. You're just a little 
                         taller.

               He goes out. Neff is alone. He watches the door close, then 
               turns and goes slowly to the water cooler. He fills a paper 
               cup and stands holding it. His thoughts are somewhere else. 
               After a moment he absently throws the cupful of water into 
               the receptacle under the cooler. He goes back to the desk. 

               He takes his rate book out of his brief case and puts it on 
               the desk. He buttons the top button of his shirt, and pulls 
               his tie right. He leaves the office, with his briefcase under 
               his arm.NEFF'S VOICEThat was it, Keyes, and there was no 
                         use kidding myself any more. Those 
                         fates I was talking about had only 
                         been stalling me off. Now they had 
                         thrown the switch. The gears had 
                         meshed. The machinery had started to 
                         move and nothing could stop it. The 
                         time for thinking had all run out. 
                         From here on it was a question of 
                         following the time table, move by 
                         move, just as we had it rehearsed. I 
                         wanted my time all accounted for for

                         the last possible moment in the

                         prospect in Pasadena about a public 
                         liability bond. When I left the office 
                         I put my rate book on the desk as if 
                         I had forgotten it. That was part of

                         Westwood. That made it a toll call 
                         and there'd be a record of it. I 
                         told him I had forgotten my rate

                         I fixed the telephone and the

                         saw me. It was already getting dark. 
                         I took the Vermont Avenue bus to Los 
                         Feliz and walked from there up to

                         was backed in, just the way I told 
                         Phyllis to have it. It was so still 
                         I could hear the ticking of the clock 
                         on the dashboard. I kept thinking of

               no shoe on his left foot. Only the white plaster shows. 
               Phyllis comes after him, carrying his suitcase and his 
               overcoat. She wears a camel's-hair coat and no hat. She

               She looks down, almost INTO THE CAMERA. A tight, cool smile 
               flashes across her face. Then, very calmly, she puts the

               closes the door again.B-41 EXT. GARAGEDietrichson stands watching Phyllis as she gets into the car 
               and drives out to pick him up. She stops beside him and opens

               For a moment, as he leans his hand on the back of the seat, 
               there is danger that he may see Neff. He doesn't. He slides 
               awkwardly into the seat and pulls the second crutch in after

               side crutches emerge, and a man (seen entirely from behind,

               is steadying himself on the ground with the crutches, Phyllis 
               has taken out Dietrichson's suitcase and overcoat. She walks 
               around the car and rolls up the right front window. She closes

               Phyllis nods. They go on. Over them is heard the noise of 
               the train coming into the station and its lights are seen.B-50 GLENDALE STATION PLATFORMThe train is just coming to a stop. The passengers move 
               forward to the tracks. Phyllis, carrying the suitcase and

               Phyllis hands the overcoat to the redcap, who leads her and 
               Neff towards car number nine. Neff still hangs back and keeps 
               his head down, the way a man using crutches might naturally 
               do.B-51 EXT. CAR #9: B-52: B-53The pullman conductor and porter stand at the steps. The

                         doesn't like to be helped.

               The redcap goes up the steps into the car. Neff laboriously 
               swings himself up onto the box and from there up on the steps, 
               keeping his head down. Meantime, Phyllis is holding the

               Phyllis nods and takes the ticket back. Neff has reached the 
               top of the steps. She goes up after him and gives him the

               waving goodbye as the train starts moving, and the porter 
               begins to close the car door. Phyllis turns and walks out of

               MAN'S VOICE speaks from behind him.MAN'S VOICECan I pull a chair out for you?

               Neff looks around. He sees a man sitting in the corner smoking 
               a hand-rolled cigarette. He is about fifty-five years old, 
               with white hair, and a broad-brimmed Stetson hat. He looks 
               like a small town lawyer or maybe a mining man. Neff does 
               not like the man's presence there very much. He turns to him 
               just enough to answer.NEFFNo thanks, I'd rather stand.MANYou going far?NEFFPalo Alto.MANMy name's Jackson. I'm going all the

               Neff stands silent. His mind is feverishly thinking of how 
               to get rid of Jackson.JACKSONPalo Alto's a nice little town. You 
                         a Stanford man?NEFFUsed to be.

               He starts patting his pockets as if looking for something.JACKSONI bet you left something behind. I

                         my overcoat back in the section.

               He rises and exits into the parlor car. Neff turns slowly 
               and watches Jackson go back through the car. Then he moves 
               to one side of the platform and looks ahead along the track 
               to orientate himself. He gives one last glance back into the 
               parlor car to make sure no one is watching him. He slips the 
               crutches from under his arms and stands on both feet. He 
               drops the crutches off the train onto the tracks, then quickly 
               swings his body over the rail.B-59 EXT. MOVING OBSERVATION CAR - CAMERA FOLLOWINGNeff is hanging onto the railing. He looks down, then lets 
               go and drops to the right-of-way. THE CAMERA STOPS. The train 
               recedes slowly into the night. Neff has fallen on the tracks. 
               He picks himself up, rubs one knee and looks back along the 
               line of the tracks and off to one side.B-60 DARK LANDSCAPE - RAILROAD TRACKSClose beyond the edge of the right-of-way, the silhouette of

               because of the improvised cast on his left foot.B-62 CAR IN THE DARKThe front door opens and Phyllis steps out. She closes the 
               door and looks in the direction of the tracks. The uneven 
               steps of Neff running towards her are heard. She opens the 
               back door of the car and leans in. She pulls the rug off the 
               corpse (which is not visible) and stands looking into the 
               car, unable to take her eyes off what she sees, while at the 
               same time her hands mechanically begin to fold the rug. The 
               running steps grow louder and Neff comes into the SHOT 
               breathing hard. He reaches her.NEFFOkay. This has to go fast. Take his 
                         hat and pick up the crutches.

               Neff points back towards the tracks. He reaches into the car 
               and begins to drag out the body by the armpits. Phyllis coolly 
               reaches past him and takes the hat off the dead man's head. 
               She turns to go.NEFFHang on to that rug. I'll need it.

               Phyllis moves out of the shot carrying the hat and rug.B-63 NEFFHe gets a stronger hold on the dead Dietrichson and drags

               Neff.B-65 NEFFHe has reached the railroad tracks. The corpse is lying beside 
               the tracks, face down. Phyllis comes up to Neff. He takes 
               the crutches and the hat from her. He throws the crutches 
               beside the corpse. He takes the hat from Phyllis and tosses 
               it carelessly along the track.NEFFLet's go. Stay behind me.

               He takes the rug from her and they move back towards the 
               car, Phyllis first, then Neff walking almost backwards, 
               sweeping the ground over which the body was dragged with the 
               rug as they go.B-66 THE CARThey reach it together.NEFFGet in. You drive.

               She gets in. Neff sweeps the ground after him as he goes 
               around the car to get in beside her. He throws the rug into 
               the back of the car.B-67 INT. CARPhyllis is behind the wheel. Neff beside her is just closing 
               the door. He props his wrapped foot against the dashboard 
               and begins to tear off the adhesive tape while at the same 
               time Phyllis presses the starter button. The starter grinds, 
               but the motor doesn't catch. She tries again. It still doesn't 
               catch. Neff looks at her. She tries a third time. The starter 
               barely turns over. The battery is very low.

               Phyllis leans back. They stare at each other desperately. 
               After a moment Neff bends forward slowly and turns the 
               ignition key to the OFF position. He holds his left thumb 
               poised over the starter button. There is a breathless moment. 
               Then he presses the starter button with swift decision. The 
               starter grinds with nerve-wracking sluggishness. Neff twists 
               the ignition key to ON and instantly pulls the hand-throttle 
               wide open. With a last feeble kick of the starter, the motor 
               catches and races. He eases the throttle down and slides 
               back into his place. They look at each other again. The 
               tenseness of the moment still shows in their faces.NEFFLet's go, baby.

               Phyllis releases the hand brake and puts the car in reverse.

               moves.B-68 DARK LANDSCAPE - WITH DUMPThe car, with the headlights out, backs up, swings around

               handkerchief from inside his shirt and soaks it with fresh 
               water.

               The office door opens behind him. He turns, hiding the 
               handkerchief behind his back. In the doorway stands the 
               colored man who has been cleaning up downstairs. He is 
               carrying his big trash box by a rope handle.COLORED MANDidn't know anybody was here, Mr. 
                         Neff. We ain't cleaned your office 
                         yet.NEFFLet it go tonight. I'm busy.COLORED MANWhatever you say, Mr. Neff.

               He closes the door slowly, staring at Neff with an uneasy 
               expression. Neff puts the soaked handkerchief back on his 
               wounded shoulder, then walks heavily over to his swivel chair 
               and lowers himself into it. He takes the dictaphone horn and 
               speaks into it again.NEFFThat was the longest night I ever 
                         lived through, Keyes, and the next 
                         day was worse, when the story broke 
                         in the papers, and they were talking 
                         about it at the office, and the day 
                         after that when you started digging 
                         into it. I kept my hands in my pockets 
                         because I thought they were shaking, 
                         and I put on dark glasses so people

               and his briefcase under his arm. He walks towards his office, 
               but half way there he runs into Keyes. Keyes is wearing his 
               vest and hat, no coat. He is carrying a file of papers and 
               smoking a cigar.KEYESCome on, Walter. The big boss wants

                         That's always wrong.

               He stops by a majolica jar full of sand and takes a pencil

               They stop at a door lettered in embossed chromium letters:

               the door to Norton's private office is opened. From inside, 
               Mr. Norton is letting out three legal looking gentlemen. 
               Norton is about forty-five, very well groomed, rather pompous 
               in manner.NORTON(To the men who are

                         Neff.

               Neff has put down his hat and briefcase. He and Keyes pass 
               the legal looking men and follow Norton into his office.C-4 INT. NORTON'S OFFICENaturally it is the best office in the building; modern but

               desk. Keyes has come in, and Neff after him closes the door 
               quietly. Norton looks disapprovingly at Keyes' shirt sleeves.NORTONYou find this an uncomfortably warm

                         distance. Up in Medford, Oregon.NORTONWho's Jackson?KEYESThe last guy that saw Dietrichson 
                         alive. They were out on the 
                         observation platform together talking. 
                         Dietrichson wanted a cigar and Jackson 
                         went to get Dietrichson's cigar case 
                         for him. When he came back to the 
                         observation platform, no Dietrichson. 
                         Jackson didn't think anything was 
                         wrong until a wire caught up with 
                         the train at Santa Barbara. They had 
                         found Dietrichson's body on the tracks

                         case.

               He walks up and down behind his desk thinking hard.NORTONAnything else?KEYESNot much. Dietrichson's secretary 
                         says she didn't know anything about 
                         the policy. There is a daughter, but 
                         all she remembers is Neff talking to 
                         her father about accident insurance 
                         at their house one night.NEFFI couldn't sell him at first. Mrs. 
                         Dietrichson opposed it. He told me 
                         he'd think it over. Later on I went 
                         down to the oil fields and closed 
                         him. He signed the application and 
                         gave me his check.NORTON(Dripping with sarcasm)
                         A fine piece of salesmanship that 
                         was, Mr. Neff.KEYESThere's no sense in pushing Neff 
                         around. He's got the best sales record 
                         in the office. Are your salesmen

                         Dietrichson fell off the train?

               There is a charged pause.KEYESI don't get it.NORTONYou don't, Mr. Keyes? Then what do 
                         you think of this case? This policy 
                         might cost us a great deal of money. 
                         As you know, it contains a double 
                         indemnity clause. Just what is your

                         interesting little hunches of yours?KEYESNope. Not even a hunch.NORTONI'm surprised, Mr. Keyes. I've formed 
                         a very definite opinion. I think I 
                         know -- in fact I know I know what 
                         happened to Dietrichson.KEYESYou know you know what?NORTONI know it was not an accident.

               He looks from Keyes to Neff and back to Keyes.NORTONWhat do you say to that?KEYESMe? You've got the ball. Let's see 
                         you run with it.NORTONThere's a widespread feeling that 
                         just because a man has a large office --

               The dictograph on his desk buzzes. He reaches over and 
               depresses a key and puts the earpiece to his ear.NORTON(Into dictograph)
                         Yes?... Have her come in, please.

               He replaces the earpiece. He turns back to Keyes and Neff.NORTON-- that just because a man has a 
                         large office he must be an idiot. 
                         I'm having a visitor, if you don't 
                         mind.

               Keyes and Neff start to get up.NORTONNo, no. I want you to stay and watch 
                         me handle this.

               The secretary has opened the door.SECRETARYMrs. Dietrichson.

               Neff stands staring at the door. He relaxes with an obvious 
               effort of will. Phyllis comes in. She wears a gray tailored 
               suit, small black hat with a veil, black gloves, and carries 
               a black bag. The secretary closes the door behind her. Mr. 
               Norton goes to meet her.NORTONThank you very much for coming, Mrs. 
                         Dietrichson. I assure you I appreciate 
                         it.

               He turns a little towards Keyes.NORTONThis is Mr. Keyes.KEYESHow do you do.PHYLLISHow do you do.NORTONAnd Mr. Neff.PHYLLISI've met Mr. Neff. How do you do.

               Norton has placed a chair. Phyllis sits. Norton goes behind 
               his desk.NORTONMrs. Dietrichson, I assure you of 
                         our sympathy in your bereavement. I 
                         hesitated before asking you to come 
                         here so soon after your loss.

               Phyllis nods silently.NORTONBut now that you're here I hope you 
                         won't mind if I plunge straight into 
                         business. You know why we asked you 
                         to come, don't you?PHYLLISNo. All I know is that your secretary 
                         made it sound very urgent.

               Keyes sits quietly in his chair with his legs crossed. He 
               has hung his hat on his foot and thrust his thumbs in the 
               armholes of his vest. He looks a little bored. Neff, behind 
               him, stands leaning against the false mantel, completely 
               dead-pan.NORTONYour husband had an accident policy 
                         with this company. Evidently you 
                         don't know that, Mrs. Dietrichson.PHYLLISNo. I remember some talk at the house --

               She looks towards Neff.PHYLLIS-- but he didn't seem to want it.NEFFHe took it out a few days later, 
                         Mrs. Dietrichson.PHYLLISI see.NORTONYou'll probably find the policy among 
                         his personal effects.PHYLLISHis safe deposit box hasn't been 
                         opened yet. It seems a tax examiner 
                         has to be present.NORTONPlease, Mrs. Dietrichson, I don't 
                         want you to think you are being 
                         subjected to any questioning. But 
                         there are a few things we should 
                         like to know.PHYLLISWhat sort of things?NORTONWe have the report of the coroner's 
                         inquest. Accidental death. We are 
                         not entirely satisfied. In fact we 
                         are not satisfied at all.

               Phyllis looks at him coolly.

               Keyes looks vaguely interested.

               Neff is staring straight at Phyllis.NORTONFrankly, Mrs. Dietrichson, we suspect 
                         suicide.

               Phyllis doesn't bat an eyelash.NORTONI'm sorry. Would you like a glass of 
                         water?PHYLLISPlease.NORTONMr. Neff.

               He indicates a thermos on a stand near Neff. Neff pours a 
               glass of water and carries it over to Phyllis. She has lifted 
               her veil a little. She takes the glass from his hand.PHYLLISThank you.

               Their eyes meet for a fraction of a second.NORTONHad your husband been moody or 
                         depressed lately, Mrs. Dietrichson? 
                         Did he seem to have financial worries, 
                         for instance?PHYLLISHe was perfectly all right and I 
                         don't know of any financial worries.NORTONThere must have been something, Mrs. 
                         Dietrichson. Let us examine this so-
                         called accident. First, your husband 
                         takes out this policy in absolute 
                         secrecy. Why? Because he doesn't 
                         want his family to suspect what he 
                         intends to do.PHYLLISDo what?NORTONCommit suicide. Next, he goes on 
                         this trip entirely alone. He has to 
                         be alone. He hobbles all the way out 
                         to the observation platform, very 
                         unlikely with his leg in a cast, 
                         unless he has a very strong reason. 
                         Once there, he finds he is not alone. 
                         There is a man there. What was his 
                         name, Keyes?

               Norton flips his fingers impatiently at Keyes who doesn't 
               even bother to look up.KEYESHis name was Jackson. Probably still 
                         is.NORTONJackson. So your husband gets rid of 
                         this Jackson with some flimsy excuse 
                         about cigars. And then he is alone. 
                         And then he does it. He jumps. 
                         Suicide. In which case the company 
                         is not liable.
                              (Pause)
                         You know that, of course. We could 
                         go to court --PHYLLISI don't know anything. In fact I 
                         don't know why I came here.

               She makes as if to rise indignantly.NORTONJust a moment, please. I said we 
                         could go to court. I didn't say we 
                         want to. Not only is it against our 
                         practice, but it would involve a 
                         great deal of expense, a lot of 
                         lawyers, a lot of time, perhaps years.

               Phyllis rises coldly.NORTONSo what I want to suggest is a 
                         compromise on both sides. A settlement 
                         for a certain sum, a part of the 
                         policy value --PHYLLISDon't bother, Mr. Norton. When I 
                         came in here I had no idea you owed 
                         me any money. You told me you did. 
                         Then you told me you didn't. Now you 
                         tell me you want to pay me a part of 
                         it, whatever it is. You want to 
                         bargain with me, at a time like this. 
                         I don't like your insinuations about 
                         my husband, Mr. Norton, and I don't 
                         like your methods. In fact I don't 
                         like you, Mr. Norton. Goodbye, 
                         gentlemen.

               She turns and walks out. The door closes after her. There is 
               a pregnant pause. Keyes straightens up in his chair.KEYESNice going, Mr. Norton. You sure 
                         carried that ball.

               Norton pours himself a glass of water and stands holding it.KEYESOnly you fumbled on the goal line. 
                         Then you heaved an illegal forward 
                         pass and got thrown for a forty-yard 
                         loss. Now you can't pick yourself up

                         sue. We can prove it was suicide.

               Keyes stands up.KEYESCan we? Mr. Norton, the first thing 
                         that hit me was that suicide angle. 
                         Only I dropped it in the wastepaper 
                         basket just three seconds later. You

                         the feet of horses, from steamboats. 
                         But Mr. Norton, of all the cases on 
                         record there's not one single case 
                         of suicide by leap from the rear end 
                         of a moving train. And do you know 
                         how fast that train was going at the 
                         point where the body was found? 
                         Fifteen miles an hour. Now how could 
                         anybody jump off a slow moving train 
                         like that with any kind of expectation 
                         that he would kill himself? No soap, 
                         Mr. Norton. We're sunk, and we're 
                         going to pay through the nose, and 
                         you know it. May I have this?

               Keyes' throat is dry after the long speech. He grabs the 
               glass of water out of Norton's hand and drains it in one big 
               gulp.

               Norton is watching him almost stupefied. Neff stands with 
               the shadow of a smile on his face. Keyes puts the glass down 
               noisily on Norton's desk.KEYESCome on, Walter.

               Norton doesn't move or speak. Keyes puts his hat on and 
               crosses towards the door, Neff after him. With the doorknob 
               in his hand Keyes turns back to Norton with a glance down at 
               his own shirt sleeves.KEYESNext time I'll rent a tuxedo.

               He hangs up, takes off his hat and drops hat and briefcase 
               on the davenport. He looks around the room and crosses to 
               lower the venetian blinds and draw the curtains. He gathers 
               up the morning paper which is lying untidily on the floor 
               and puts it in the waste-paper basket.

               The door bell rings.

               Neff stops in sudden alarm. It can't be Phyllis. The time is 
               too short. For a second he stands there motionless, then 
               crosses to the door and opens it.

               In the open door stands Keyes.NEFFHello, Keyes.

               Keyes walks past him into the room. His hands are clasped 
               behind his back. There is a strange, absent-minded look in 
               his eyes. Neff closes the door without taking his eyes off 
               Keyes.NEFFWhat's on your mind?

               He has stopped in front of Neff. They look at each other for 
               a tense moment. Neff hardly breathes.

               Keyes shakes his head suddenly.KEYESNo. That couldn't be it. You delivered

               There is another longer pause, agonizing for Neff. Finally 
               Keyes continues:KEYESLook. A man takes out an accident

               Neff, behind him, looks anxiously down the hallway for

               He gets up and goes out. Lola has walked over to the window

               At the sound of the closing door she turns and speaks with a

                         have such a strange feeling that 
                         there is something queer about my

                         you with my troubles, except that 
                         you knew my father and knew about 
                         the insurance he took out. And you 
                         were so nice to me that evening in 
                         your car.NEFFSure. We got along fine, didn't we.

               He sits down. His face is grim and watchful.LOLALook at me, Mr. Neff. I'm not crazy. 
                         I'm not hysterical. I'm not even 
                         crying. But I have the awful feeling 
                         that something is wrong, and I had 
                         the same feeling once before -- when 
                         my mother died.NEFFWhen your mother died?LOLAWe were up at Lake Arrowhead. That 
                         was six years ago. We had a cabin 
                         there. It was winter and very cold 
                         and my mother was very sick with 
                         pneumonia. She had a nurse with her. 
                         There were just the three of us in 
                         the cabin. One night I got up and 
                         went into my mother's room. She was 
                         delirious with fever. All the bed 
                         covers were on the floor and the 
                         windows were wide open. The nurse 
                         wasn't in the room. I ran and covered 
                         my mother up as quickly as I could. 
                         Just then I heard a door open behind 
                         me. The nurse stood there. She didn't 
                         say a word, but there was a look in 
                         her eyes I'll never forget. Two days 
                         later my mother was dead.

               Neff stares at her tensely. He knows only too well who the

                         later she married him and I kind of 
                         talked myself out of the idea that 
                         she could have done anything like 
                         that. But now it's all back again,

                         She was in her room in front of a 
                         mirror, with a black hat on, and she 
                         was pinning a black veil to it, as 
                         if she couldn't wait to see how she 
                         would look in mourning.NEFFLook. You've had a pretty bad shock. 
                         Aren't you just imagining all this?LOLAI caught her eyes in the mirror, and 
                         they had that look in them they had 
                         before my mother died. That same

                         Neff? She's not going to get away 
                         with it this time. I'm going to speak

                         like that.LOLAI'm not afraid. You'll see.

               She turns again to the window so he won't see that she is 
               crying. Neff gets up and goes to her.LOLAI'm sorry. I didn't mean to act like

               Neff is wearing a light summer suit, very much in contrast 
               to Lola's mourning. Apparently she is telling him a story 
               and now and then she laughs, but there is no sound.

                         a ride down to the beach. She had 
                         loosened up a bit and she was even 
                         laughing... I had to make sure she 
                         wouldn't tell that stuff about Phyllis 
                         to anybody else. It was dynamite,

                         had no chance to talk to Phyllis. 
                         You were watching her like a hawk, 
                         Keyes. I couldn't even phone her for

               Keyes' office. As he comes up close to the door, he stops 
               with a startled expression on his face. On a chair beside 
               the door sits a familiar figure. He is Jackson, the man from 
               the observation platform of the train. He is wearing his 
               Stetson hat and smoking a cigar. He is studying something in 
               the file folder. Neff recognizes him immediately but Jackson 
               does not look up. Neff controls his expression and goes on 
               to open the door to Keyes' office.NEFF'S VOICEMonday morning there was a note on 
                         my desk that you wanted to see me, 
                         Keyes. For a minute I wondered if it 
                         could be about Lola. It was worse. 
                         Outside your door was the last guy

                         as anybody ever ran into. Smart and

               Keyes levels a finger at him.KEYESYou know what? That guy Dietrichson 
                         was never on the train.NEFFHe wasn't?KEYESNo, he wasn't, Walter. Look, you 
                         can't be sure of killing a man by 
                         throwing him off a train that's going 
                         fifteen miles an hour. The only way 
                         you can be sure is to kill him first 
                         and then throw his body on the tracks. 
                         That would mean either killing him 
                         on the train, or -- and this is where 
                         it really gets fancy -- you kill him 
                         somewhere else and put him on the 
                         tracks. Two possibilities, and I 
                         personally buy the second.NEFFYou're way ahead of me, Keyes.KEYESLook, it was like this. They killed 
                         the guy -- the wife and somebody 
                         else -- and then the somebody else 
                         took the crutches and went on the 
                         train as Dietrichson, and then the 
                         somebody else jumped off, and then 
                         they put the body on the tracks where 
                         the train had passed. An 
                         impersonation, see. And a cinch to 
                         work. Because it was night, very few 
                         people were about, they had the 
                         crutches to stare at, and they never 
                         really looked at the man at all.NEFFIt's fancy all right, Keyes. Maybe 
                         it's a little too fancy.KEYESIs it? I tell you it fits together 
                         like a watch. And now let's see what 
                         we have in the way of proof. The 
                         only guy that really got a good look 
                         at this supposed Dietrichson is 
                         sitting right outside my office. I 
                         took the trouble to bring him down 
                         here from Oregon. Let's see what he 
                         has to say.

                         in a hurry. Let's have it.

               Jackson indicates the file folder he is holding.JACKSONAre these photographs of the late 
                         Mr. Dietrichson?KEYESYes.JACKSONThen my answer is no.KEYESWhat do you mean no?JACKSONI mean this is not the man that was 
                         on the train.KEYESWill you swear to that?JACKSONI'm a Medford man. Medford, Oregon. 
                         And if I say it, I mean it, and if I 
                         mean it, of course I'll swear it.KEYESThank you.

               Keyes turns to Neff.KEYESThere you are, Walter. There's your 
                         proof.

               Keyes remembers he forgot to introduce Jackson.KEYESOh, Mr. Jackson, this is Mr. Neff,

                         platform?JACKSONWell, I'm pretty sure he was a younger 
                         man, about ten or fifteen years 
                         younger than the man in these

                         he, Walter?NEFFFifty-one, according to the policy.JACKSONThe man I saw was nothing like fifty-
                         one years old. Of course, it was 
                         pretty dark on that platform and, 
                         come to think of it, he tried to 
                         keep his back towards me. But I'm 
                         positive just the same.KEYESThat's fine, Jackson. Now you

               Keyes picks up the telephone on his desk and speaks into it.KEYESGet me Lubin, in the cashier's office.

               Meanwhile, Jackson crosses over to Neff and, during the 
               ensuing dialogue between him and Neff, we hear Keyes' low 
               voice on the phone in background. We do not hear what he

               He goes out.KEYESThere it is, Walter. It's beginning

                         A murder's never perfect. It always 
                         comes apart sooner or later. And 
                         when two people are involved it's 
                         usually sooner. We know the 
                         Dietrichson dame is in it, and 
                         somebody else. Pretty soon we're 
                         going to know who that somebody else

                         Sometime, somewhere, they've got to 
                         meet. Their emotions are all kicked 
                         up. Whether it's love or hate doesn't 
                         matter. They can't keep away from 
                         each other. They think it's twice as 
                         safe because there are two of them. 
                         But it's not twice as safe. It's ten 
                         times twice as dangerous. They've 
                         committed a murder and that's not 
                         like taking a trolley ride together 
                         where each one can get off at a 
                         different stop. They're stuck with 
                         each other. They've got to ride all 
                         the way to the end of the line. And 
                         it's a one-way trip, and the last

               Keyes goes toward the street and OUT OF SCENE. Neff moves 
               back into the lobby, CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM. As he reaches the 
               elevator, he looks back over his shoulder, to make sure Keyes 
               is gone, then steps into the empty elevator.NEFF'S VOICEYou sure had me worried, Keyes. I

               finds them locked. His eye falls on the dictaphone on the 
               stand beside the desk. A record is on it, the needle is about 
               two-thirds of the way towards the end. He lifts the needle

               Neff sits, staring blankly at the wall. The cylinder goes on 
               revolving, but no more voice comes -- only the whir of the 
               needle on the empty record. At last he remembers to replace 
               the horn. He hangs it back on its hook. The machine stops.

               back towards the reception room entrance, then stands there 
               looking out through the glass doors. All the employees have 
               now left. Neff is entirely alone. He moves as if to go out, 
               then stops rigidly as his face lights up with excitement of

               perspiration from his forehead and the palms of his hands.

               hand. She reaches the front door, opens it slightly, fixes 
               the catch so that the door can be opened from outside. She

               lit. The only other light in the room is a standing lamp 
               beside the desk. A window toward the back is open, and through 
               it comes the SOUNDS OF MUSIC, probably a neighboring radio.

               Phyllis enters and crosses to the table. She puts out the 
               lamp, then moves over to the desk and puts out the lamp there. 
               The room is filled with bright moonlight coming in at the 
               windows.

               Phyllis crosses to the chair by the fireplace (the one she 
               sat in the first time Neff came to the house). She lifts the 
               loose cushion and puts what was in the scarf behind it. As 
               she withdraws the scarf, there is a brief glint of something 
               metallic before she covers the hidden object with the cushion 
               again.

               She turns to the low table in front of the davenport and 
               takes a cigarette from the box. She takes a match and is 
               about to strike it when, just then, she hears a car coming 
               up the hill. She listens, motionless. The car stops. A car 
               door is slammed.

               Calmly, Phyllis strikes the match and lights her cigarette. 
               She drops the match casually into a tray, goes back to the 
               chair, sits down and waits, quietly smoking. There are 
               footsteps outside the house.

               Over the chair in which Phyllis is sitting, the hallway is 
               visible through the arch. The front door opens. Neff comes 
               in, he is silhouetted against the moonlight as he stands

                         You're rotten clear through. You got 
                         me to take care of your husband, and 
                         then you got Zachetti to take care 
                         of Lola, and maybe take care of me 
                         too, and then somebody else would 
                         have come along to take care of 
                         Zachetti for you. That's the way you 
                         operate isn't it, baby.PHYLLISSuppose it is, Walter. Is what you've 
                         cooked up for tonight any better?

               Neff gets up from the davenport. He listens to the music for 
               a moment.NEFFI don't like this music anymore. 
                         It's too close. Do you mind if I 
                         shut the window?

               Phyllis just stares at him. He goes quietly over to the window 
               and shuts it and draws the curtain. Phyllis speaks to his 
               back:PHYLLIS(Her voice low and 
                              urgent)
                         Walter!

               Neff turns, something changes in his face. There is the report 
               of a gun. He stands motionless for a moment, then very slowly 
               starts towards her. CAMERA IS SHOOTING OVER HIS SHOULDER at 
               Phyllis as she stands with the gun in her hand. Neff stops 
               after he has taken a few steps.NEFFWhat's the matter? Why don't you 
                         shoot again? Maybe if I came a little 
                         closer?

               Neff takes a few more steps towards her and stops again.NEFFHow's that. Do you think you can do 
                         it now?

               Phyllis is silent. She doesn't shoot. Her expression is 
               tortured. Neff goes on until he is close to her. Quietly he 
               takes the gun out of her unresisting hand.NEFFWhy didn't you shoot, baby?

               Phyllis puts her arms around him in complete surrender.NEFFDon't tell me it's because you've 
                         been in love with me all this time.PHYLLISNo. I never loved you, Walter. Not 
                         you, or anybody else. I'm rotten to 
                         the heart. I used you, just as you 
                         said. That's all you ever meant to 
                         me -- until a minute ago. I didn't 
                         think anything like that could ever 
                         happen to me.NEFFI'm sorry, baby. I'm not buying.PHYLLISI'm not asking you to buy. Just hold 
                         me close.

               Neff draws her close to him. She reaches up to his face and 
               kisses him on the lips. As she comes out of the kiss there 
               is realization in her eyes that this is the final moment.NEFFGoodbye, baby.

               Out of the shot the gun explodes once, twice. Phyllis quivers 
               in his arms. Her eyes fill with tears. Her head falls limp 
               against his shoulder. Slowly he lifts her and carries her to 
               the davenport. He lays her down on it carefully, almost 
               tenderly. The moonlight coming in at the French doors shines 
               on the anklet. He looks at it for the last time and slowly 
               turns away. As he does so, he puts his hand inside his coat 
               and it comes out with blood on it. Only then is it apparent 
               that Phyllis' shot actually did hit him. He looks at the 
               blood on his fingers with a dazed expression and quickly 
               goes out of the room, the way he came.D-21 EXT. DIETRICHSON HOME - (NIGHT)Neff comes out of the house. He closes the front door with 
               his right hand. His left arm hangs limp. He takes a few steps 
               down the walk, then suddenly hears somebody approaching. He 
               moves behind the palm tree near the walk.

               A man comes up the steps towards the front door -- Zachetti. 
               Just as he reaches the door, Neff calls to him.NEFFHey you. Come here a minute. I said 
                         come here, Zachetti.

               Zachetti turns and approaches him slowly.NEFFThe name is Neff.ZACHETTIYeah? And I still don't like it. 
                         What do you want?NEFFLook, kid, I want to give you a 
                         present.

               He takes some loose change out of his pocket and holds out a 
               coin.NEFFHere's a nice new nickel.ZACHETTIWhat's the gag?NEFFSuppose you go back down the hill to 
                         a drug store and make a phone call.

               Neff starts to drop the nickel into Zachetti's handkerchief 
               pocket. Zachetti knocks his hand away.ZACHETTIKeep your nickel and buy yourself an 
                         ice cream cone.NEFFThe number is Granite 0386. Ask for 
                         Miss Dietrichson. The first name is 
                         Lola.ZACHETTILola? She isn't worth a nickel. And 
                         if I ever talk to her, it's not going 
                         to be over any telephone.NEFFTough, aren't you? Take the nickel. 
                         Take it and call her. She wants you 
                         to.ZACHETTIYeah? She doesn't want any part of 
                         me.NEFFI know who told you that, and it's 
                         not true. She's in love with you. 
                         Always has been. Don't ask me why. I 
                         couldn't even guess.

               Zachetti just stares at him. Neff moves again to put the 
               nickel into Zachetti's pocket. This time Zachetti allows him 
               to do it.NEFFNow beat it. Granite 0386, I told 
                         you.

               He motions toward the street below.NEFFThat way.

               Zachetti goes slowly past him. Neff grabs him and pushes him 
               almost violently down the walk. Zachetti goes out of shot. 
               The sound of his steps dies away as Neff looks after him. 
               Then, far off in the distance, the SIREN OF A POLICE CAR is 
               heard.

               Neff moves off through the shrubbery toward the side of the 
               house where he parked his car.DISSOLVE TO:D-22 NEFF'S OFFICE - (NIGHT)The desk lamp is still lighted. Outside the windows, the 
               dawn is slowly breaking.

               Neff is still clutching the horn of the dictaphone. There 
               are eight or nine used cylinders on the desk beside him. A 
               widening stain of blood shows on the left shoulder of his 
               gray jacket. He is very weak by now, and his voice holds a 
               note of utter exhaustion.NEFFIt's almost four-thirty now, Keyes. 
                         It's cold. I wonder if she's still 
                         lying there alone in that house, or 
                         whether they've found her by now. I 
                         wonder a lot of things, but they 
                         don't matter any more, except I want 
                         to ask you to do me a favor. I want 
                         you to be the one to tell Lola, kind 
                         of gently, before it breaks wide 
                         open... Yes, and I'd like you to 
                         look after her and that guy Zachetti, 
                         so he doesn't get pushed around too 
                         much. Because...

               Suddenly he stops his dictation with an instinctive feeling 
               that he is not alone in the room.

               As he turns in his chair the CAMERA PULLS BACK slowly. The 
               office door is wide open. Keyes is standing a few steps inside 
               it. Behind him, on the balcony outside, stands the night 
               watchman and the colored janitor, peering curiously into the 
               room over Keyes' shoulder.

               Slowly, and without taking his eyes off Neff's face, Keyes 
               reaches back and pushes the door shut.

               Neff hangs up the dictaphone horn. He looks at Keyes with a 
               faint, tired grin and speaks very slowly.NEFFHello, Keyes.

               Keyes moves towards him a few steps and stands without 
               answering.NEFFUp pretty early, aren't you? I always 
                         wondered what time you got down to 
                         work.

               Keyes, staring at him, still does not answer.NEFFOr did your little man pull you out 
                         of bed?KEYESThe janitor did. Seems you leaked a 
                         little blood on the way in here.NEFFWouldn't be surprised.

               Neff makes a motion indicating the used cylinders standing 
               on the desk.NEFFI wanted to straighten out that 
                         Dietrichson story for you.KEYESSo I gather.NEFFHow long have you been standing there?KEYESLong enough.NEFFKind of a crazy story with a crazy 
                         twist to it. One you didn't quite 
                         figure out.KEYESYou can't figure them all, Walter.NEFFThat's right. You can't, can you? 
                         And now I suppose I get the big 
                         speech, the one with all the two-
                         dollar words in it. Let's have it, 
                         Keyes.KEYESYou're all washed up, Walter.NEFFThanks, Keyes. That was short anyway.

               They stare at each other for a long moment, then, with intense 
               effort Neff gets up on his feet and stands there swaying a 
               little. His face is covered with sweat. His shoulder is 
               bleeding. He is on the verge of collapse.KEYESWalter, I'm going to call a doctor.NEFF(Bitterly)
                         What for? So they can patch me up?

                         back on my feet? So I can walk under 
                         my own power into that gas chamber 
                         up in San Quentin? Is that it, Keyes?KEYESSomething like that, Walter.NEFFWell, I've got a different idea. 
                         Look here. Suppose you went back to 
                         bed and didn't find these cylinders 
                         till tomorrow morning, when the office 
                         opens. From then on you can play it 
                         any way you like. Would you do that 
                         much for me, Keyes?KEYESGive me one good reason.NEFFI need four hours to get where I'm 
                         going.KEYESYou're not going anywhere, Walter.NEFFYou bet I am. I'm going across the 
                         border.KEYESYou haven't got a chance.NEFFGood enough to try for.KEYESYou'll never make the border.NEFFThat's what you think. Watch me.

               Neff starts to move towards the door, staggering a little, 
               holding himself upright with great effort.KEYES(In a voice of stony 
                              calm)
                         You'll never even make the elevator.

               Neff has reached the door. He twists the knob and drags the 
               door open. He turns in it to look back at Keyes' implacable 
               face.NEFFSo long, Keyes.

               Neff goes out, leaving the door wide open. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS 
               his staggering walk along the BALCONY TOWARDS THE ELEVATOR 
               LOBBY. The sound of his breathing is so harsh and loud that 
               for a moment it dominates the scene. Finally he reaches the 
               swing doors leading into the lobby and starts to push them 
               open. At this moment he collapses. He clutches the edge of 
               the door and as it swings around with him he falls to the 
               floor. He tries to struggle up but cannot rise.

               In background comes the sound of a telephone being dialed.KEYES' VOICEHello... Send an ambulance to the 
                         Pacific Building on Olive Street... 
                         Yeah... It's a police job.

               There is the sound of the phone being replaced in its cradle. 
               Then there are footsteps growing louder along the balcony 
               and Keyes walks slowly into the shot. He kneels down beside 
               Neff.KEYESHow you doing, Walter?

               Neff manages a faint smile.NEFFI'm fine. Only somebody moved the 
                         elevator a couple of miles away.KEYESThey're on the way.NEFF(Slowly and with great

               The eyes of the two men meet in a moment of silence.NEFFI love you too.

               Neff fumbles for the handkerchief in Keyes' pocket, pulls it 
               out and clumsily wipes his face with it. The handkerchief 
               drops from his hand. He gets a loose cigarette out of his 
               pocket and puts it between his lips. Then with great 
               difficulty he gets out a match, tries to strike it, but is 
               too weak. Keyes takes the match out of his hand, strikes it 
               for him and lights his cigarette.FADE OUT:THE ENDThe following pages are for an alternate ending that director

               gas chamber. BOOM SHOT towards guard standing BACK TO CAMERA 
               at entrance door. Except for this guard the room is empty.

               Guard opens the door. Two other guards enter, followed by a 
               group of witnesses and newspaper men, each of whom removes 
               his hat as he enters the room. They form a group around the 
               outside of the gas chamber, some looking in through the glass 
               windows, some standing in the background on low platforms 
               against the wall.THE CAMERA SLOWLY BEGINS TO MOVE IN AND DOWN, AND CENTERS ONKeyes, as he enters the room and stands behind the door. His 
               face is seen through the bars of the door, which is then 
               closed, and CAMERA MOVES TO A CLOSEUP. His eyes follow the 
               action of the closing door, then slowly look towards the gas 
               chamber.E-2 THE GAS CHAMBER, EMPTYOn its windows show reflections of the spectators, including 
               the face of Keyes.

               The door to the gas chamber opens in the background, and 
               beyond that another door opens. Neff comes in between two 
               guards. He is wearing a white open-necked shirt, blue denim 
               pants, and walks barefooted on a cocoanut matting. He moves 
               into the gas chamber, looks through the windows in the 
               direction of Keyes and nods quickly, recognizing him. The 
               guards turn him around and seat him in one of the two metal 
               chairs, with his back to the witnesses. They strap his arms, 
               legs and body to the chair. The guards go out.E-3 THE DOOR TO THE GAS CHAMBERIt is open. The three guards come out of the gas chamber 
               into the ante-chamber, where stand the warden, executioner, 
               two doctors, the minister and the acid man, and possibly 
               several guards.

               The executioner and one guard close the door. The guard spins 
               the big wheel which tightens it. The wheel at first turns 
               very quickly, then, as it tightens, the guard uses 
               considerable force to seal the chamber tight. The guard steps 
               out of the shot. The gas chamber is now sealed.E-4 THE WITNESSES AND KEYESThey are intently watching Neff in the gas chamber.E-5 THE ANTE-CHAMBERThe warden looks slowly around the room, sees that everyone 
               is in his proper place and that the stethoscope, which one 
               doctor holds, is connected with the outlet in the wall of 
               the gas chamber. Also that the man in charge of the acid is 
               ready. The warden makes a motion to the acid man. The acid 
               man releases the mixed acid into a pipe connecting with a 
               countersunk receptacle under Neff's chair. (This action is 
               only suggested). The warden looks at the clock, then turns 
               to the executioner and nods.E-6 THE EXECUTIONER - MED. SHOT - CAMERA SHOOTING DOWN FROMHIGH ANGLE TOWARDS EXECUTIONERHe pushes a metal lever. (This immerses the pellets of cyanide 
               in the acid under the chair.)E-7 INT. GAS CHAMBER - MED. SHOTCAMERA IS SHOOTING ABOVE Neff's head (just out of shot), 
               towards spectators standing outside the gas chamber, Keyes 
               in the center. Gas floats up into scene between CAMERA and 
               spectators. Keyes, unable to watch, looks away.E-8 THE FIRST DOCTOR - CLOSE SHOTas he listens on stethoscope connected with the gas chamber. 
               He glances at the clock above his head.E-9 THE SECOND DOCTOR - CLOSE SHOTHe stands to right of the gas chamber door, taking notes on 
               a pad. He glances towards First Doctor (out of scene) and 
               looks through venetian blinds into the gas chamber. The acid 
               man stands near him.E-10 THE FIRST DOCTORCAMERA SHOOTING FROM HIGH ANGLE TOWARDS HIM as he listens on 
               stethoscope. The doctor glances at the clock again. He takes 
               his stethoscope from his ears. He nods to the warden, This 
               indicates that the man is dead. CAMERA PANS with warden as 
               he turns to open the door connecting the ante-chamber with 
               the witness room.E-11 THE WITNESS ROOM - LONG SHOT FROM HIGH ON BOOM DOWN ONWITNESSES GROUPED AROUND GAS CHAMBERThe door connecting with the ante-chamber opens. A guard 
               comes through.GUARDThat's all, gentlemen, Vacate the 
                         chamber, please.

               The guard withdraws and closes the door by which he entered. 
               The witnesses slowly start to file out. A guard has opened 
               the outer door. The witnesses put their hats on as they pass 
               through. A few go close to the windows of the gas chamber to 
               look in at the dead man before they leave.

               All the witnesses have now left, except Keyes, who stands, 
               shocked and tragic, beyond the door. The guard goes to him 
               and touches his arm, indicating to him that he must leave. 
               Keyes glances for the last time towards the gas chamber and 
               slowly moves to go out.E-12 CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE DEATH CHAMBERCAMERA SHOOTING IN THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR AT KEYES, who is 
               just turning to leave. Keyes comes slowly out into the dark, 
               narrow corridor. His hat is on his head now, his overcoat is 
               pulled around him loosely. He walks like an old man. He takes 
               eight or ten steps, then mechanically reaches a cigar out of 
               his vest pocket and puts it in his mouth. His hands, in the 
               now familiar gesture, begin to pat his pockets for matches.

               Suddenly he stops, with a look of horror on his face. He 
               stands rigid, pressing a hand against his heart. He takes 
               the cigar out of his mouth and goes slowly on towards the 
               door, CAMERA PANNING with him. When he has almost reached 
               the door, the guard stationed there throws it wide, and a 
               blaze of sunlight comes in from the prison yard outside.

               Keyes slowly walks out into the sunshine. stiffly, his head 
               bent, a forlorn and lonely man.FADE OUT:THE END
