               CAMERA PULLS BACK to disclose the rest of the anteroom. To 
               Camera left are the elevators -- at back wall directly behind 
               switchboard are chairs and a table for visitors. Next to 
               switchboard are stairs leading downward to the next floor. A 
               waist-high iron grill with a gate in it separates the 
               switchboard from the anteroom, a similar grill separating it 
               again from the city room which stretches on beyond 
               switchboard. At a table in the switchboard enclosure sits an 
               office boy, about fifteen, doing a crossword puzzle. The big 
               clock on the back wall shows that it is nearly one o'clock.CLOSE SHOT OFFICE BOYas he bends over paper. We catch a glimpse of the squares of

               Bruce, embarrassed, looks at the office boy, then looks back 
               at Hildy as they turn toward second gate leading into City 
               Room.BRUCEI said -- uh -- I said even ten

                         it, but I just wanted to hear it 
                         again. I can stand being spoiled a 
                         little. The gentleman I'm going to

                         you?HILDYMy job, Bruce. I started it -- and

               She starts to push open the iron-grilled gate leading into 
               the City Room. Bruce quickly springs forward and opens it 
               for her. Hildy smiles.HILDYThanks, Bruce.

               She kisses his cheek and walks through. He looks after her. 
               The office boy whistles. Bruce pays no attention, but stares 
               after Hildy.MEDIUM SHOT - SHOOTING DOWN LENGTH OF CITY ROOMHildy starts to walk through City Room.TRUCKING SHOT - HILDYas she walks the length of the City Room. It's a long walk, 
               because it's a room that takes up practically the whole floor. 
               The scene is a busy one. But, gradually, as Hildy starts 
               down, one after another recognize her. There are cries of: 
               "Hildy!" "Hello, Hildy", etc., from the men as Hildy goes 
               straight down the aisle. She never stops but waves her own 
               greetings: "Jim!" "Hi, good-looking!" "Laura" "Hullo, Pop" 
               "Nan!" "Eddie!" "Hello, Mac" "Pete!" "Frank" "Oscar!", and 
               gets responses from each of them. One man is bent over his 
               desk reading his copy -- he is standing up. Hildy slaps him 
               as she goes by. He turns around: "Say, who did that?" As he 
               sees Hildy: "Hello, Hildy!" Hildy: "Hi, Jake." She passes a 
               middle-aged woman, almost an Edna May Oliver type, seated at 
               a desk pounding out copy and smoking a cigarette. As Hildy 
               comes up to her she slaps the woman on the back.HILDYHello, Beatrice. How's "Advice to 
                         the Lovelorn"?BEATRICE(looking up)
                         Hildy! I'll be a monkey's uncle!
