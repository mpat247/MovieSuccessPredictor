500 DAYS OF SUMMERWritten byScott Neustadter & Michael H. WeberFirst DraftSIMPLE BLACK ON WHITE CREDITS ROLL TO BIG STAR'S "I'M IN LOVEWITH A GIRL." When all is said and done, up comes a single
          number in parenthesis, like so:(478)EXT. PARK - DAYFor a few seconds we watch A MAN (20s) and a WOMAN (20s) on a
          park bench. Their names are TOM and SUMMER. Neither one says
          a word.CLOSE ON her HAND, covering his. Notice the wedding ring. No
          words are spoken. Tom looks at her the way every woman wants
          to be looked at.A DISTINGUISHED VOICE begins to speak to us.NARRATORThis is a story of boy meets girl.CUT TO:(1)INT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAYThe boy is TOM HANSEN. He sits at a very long rectangular
          conference table. The walls are lined with framed blow-up
          sized greeting cards. Tom, dark hair and blue eyes, wears a t-
          shirt under his sports coat and Adidas tennis shoes to
          balance out the corporate dress code. He looks pretty bored.NARRATORThe boy, Tom Hansen of Margate, New
                    Jersey, grew up believing that he'd
                    never truly be happy until the day
                    he met his... "soulmate."CUT TO:INT LIVING ROOM - 1989PRE-TEEN TOM sits alone on his bed engrossed in a movie. His
          walls are covered in posters of obscure bands. From the TV,
          we hear: "Elaine! Elaine!"4.NARRATORThis belief stemmed from early
                    exposure to sad British pop music
                    and a total misreading of the
                    movie, "The Graduate."CUT TO:INT OFFICE CUBICLE - PRESENT DAYThe girl is SUMMER FINN. She files folders and answers phones
          in a plain white office. She has cropped blonde hair almost
          like a boy's but her face is feminine and pretty enough to
          get away with it.NARRATORThe girl, Summer Finn of
                    Shinnecock, Michigan, did not share
                    this belief.CUT TO:INT BATHROOM - 1994Teenage Summer stares at herself in the mirror. Her hair
          extends down to her lower back.NARRATORSince the disintegration of her
                    parents' marriage, she'd only loved
                    two things. The first was her long
                    blonde hair.She picks up scissors from the counter and begins to slice.NARRATORThe second was how easily she could
                    cut it off... And feel nothing.CUT TO:SPLITSCREEN. INT BOARDROOM/ INT CUBICLE - SAMEOn the right side of the screen, Tom continues to listen to
          some boring presentation. On the left, Summer answers a call,
          takes a message, and walks out of her cubicle down a long
          narrow hallway.5.NARRATORTom meets Summer on January 8th in
                    a San Francisco office building. In
                    an instant, he will know she's the
                    one he's been looking for.CU Summer opening the door to the boardroom, about to come
          face to face with Tom for the first time.NARRATORThis is a story of boy meets girl.But before they do,CUT TO:BLACK.NARRATORYou should know up front, this is

          breath as the opening bars of "Born to Run" begin to play and
          Summer starts to sing. Tom sees Summer as the actress in
          whatever nonsensical karaoke video accompanies the song (it's
          something to do with an old convertible, the sunset, and a
          midget in a tuxedo.)LATER. Tom sits in the booth with McKenzie (doing a shot) as
          Summer chats with co-workers at another table. Tom can't help

          head turn his way. Tom gives up and watches the movie.ANGLE ON THE MOVIE SCREEN. We see a BLACK AND WHITE FILM.83.It's a MAN racing down the street, fleeing from an unseen
          assassin. When he turns around we see the man is TOM. Bullets

          Hall and Oates following Tom, almost trying to cheer him up.

          sitting with Summer.TOMWell...glad you came?SUMMEROf course. Where am I exactly?TOMWhen you turn 13 in the Jewish

          Tom watches her go.CUT TO:(240)SPLITSCREEN - TOM'S BEDROOM/ SUMMER'S BEDROOM - MORNINGTom is wide-awake, sitting fully dressed on his bed putting
          his shoes on. He holds the phone up to his ear.TOMHey.Summer is half-asleep under the covers. The phone lays at her
          side and she angles towards it.SUMMERHello?TOMAre you still sleeping?SUMMER(GROGGY)I'm getting up. What time is it?TOM10:30. Are we still hanging out
                    today?SUMMEROk. Sure.TOMI'll meet you at Liberty in... 20
                    minutes?SUMMERI might need 45.EXT PARK - DAYTom and Summer are having a picnic. If it looks familiar,
          it's cause we saw them here on page 7. This is that fateful
          day Tom described to his sister and his friends. The day it
          all, finally, fell apart.103.TOMSo how was last night?SUMMERIt was fine. Just a work thing.TOMWhere did you guys go?SUMMERSome restaurant.TOMFun?SUMMERUneventful. Didn't get home until
                    after 12 though which is way too
                    late for a stupid work function.
                    How was your night?TOMPretty standard.Not much more to say. Stay with them for a few extra beats of
          silence.EXT OUTDOOR MARKET - LATERTom and Summer shopping at the fruit market. Unless we were
          looking for trouble we wouldn't see any. But since we are, we
          might notice she lags behind him as they walk through the
          aisles. His hands are in his pockets. He's bored. She's
          distant. But only if we're really looking.(406)INT. APARTMENT - LATERTom, almost with a full beard, is redecorating his apartment
          again. We see him rearranging the furniture in the room.LATER. He hangs some new pictures.LATER. He uses a pencil on the wall to mark for a bookshelf.
          Then he uses a ruler to make sure his marks are even. He
          draws a faint line on the wall to mark where he needs to nail
          something.104.(240)INT COFFEE HOUSE - LATERThat day again. As we've seen before, Tom reads a newspaper.
          Summer reads a novel.TOMIt's playing at 5.SUMMERYou want to go?TOMI don't know. You wanna maybe go
                    back to your place or ---SUMMERI want to see it. Let's go.TOMOk cool.SUMMERUnless you don't want to.TOMNo, I will. That's fine.SUMMEROk.A few more silent beats. Something's in the air.INT MOVIE - LATERTom and Summer watching the film. Tears begin to well in
          Summer's eyes. They soon turn to audible sobs. Tom turns to
          look at her, to offer some sort of comfort, believing it to
          be a response to the movie. She doesn't look back.(409)INT TOM'S BEDROOM - DAYTom drawing a straight line on his wall. Redecorating.105.And then he stops.He looks at the line he's drawn. He extends it a little bit.
          He draws another. He begins to furiously draw on the wall.
          From out of nowhere, inspiration has hit. An image starts to
          form. A pretty impressive looking futuristic skyscraper,
          almost shaped like a tear drop.(240)EXT MOVIE THEATRE - LATERSame day from the past. They walk out, at first everything's
          alright. It's exactly as we saw on page 7. But soon after
          that she begins to cry again. Serious, real sobbing.TOMHey.He goes to hug her. He hugs her. It's unclear if she hugs
          back.TOMHey Sum, it's just a movie.SUMMERI know. I'm sorry Tom.TOMIs everything alright with you?She smiles, tries to pull herself together.SUMMERYeah. I'm just...I'm sorry. I'm
                       being ridiculous.TOMIt's ok. This happens to me every
                       time I watch "Hoosiers." Let's go
                       for a walk, ok. Let's get some air.
                       Or go to Sister Ray's.SUMMEROk.They walk.106.INT RECORD STORE - NIGHTTom and a much more in control Summer walk down the aisles.
          He grabs one.TOMIt pains me that we live in a world
                    where no one's ever heard of
                    Spearmint.SUMMERI've never heard of them.TOMAnd it's painful. Oh look.He grabs a Ringo Starr album and shows it to her, just as
          we've seen on Page 7. She smiles and they continue on down
          the aisles.In CU, Tom goes to hold Summer's hand. But something happens.
          It could be a total coincidence, but just as his hand
          approaches hers (in SLO-MO), she moves it away and keeps it
          at her side. Tom puts his hands in his pockets, unsure if
          there's something to read in that.(411)EXT HARBOR - DAYTom sketches intensely. The landscape, the skyline, the
          works. He's in the zone.(240)EXT RECORD STORE - LATERAgain, that fateful day continues. Tom and Summer outside.SUMMERSo.TOMSo... Now what?107.SUMMERNow...I think I'm gonna call it a
                    day.TOMYeah? You wanna maybe...get some
                    dinner or something?SUMMERI've got pasta at home.TOMAre you hungry?SUMMERI'm pretty hungry, but --TOMOoh!SUMMERWhat?TOMI've got a great idea!SUMMERWhat?TOMLet's get breakfast.SUMMERNow?TOMPancakes?Summer's resistance is futile. And the rest as they say is

          first met him, sketches on his bed with one hand while
          holding a phone with the other.2. EXT CITY SIDEWALK - DAYTom sits on a street corner drawing new additions to the
          city's skyline.2. INT LIBRARY - DAYTom sits with his feet up on a table, headphones on his ears,
          reading one of many Taschen books on innovative building
          design.3. INT OFFICE LOBBY - DAYTom drops off his portfolio with the security guard in the
          lobby of a high-rise.4. EXT SOCCER FIELD - DAYTom and his mom and step-dad cheer on his sister playing
          soccer. It's a nice temporary distraction for him.6. INT TOM'S BEDROOM - DAYTom getting bad news on the phone. He has a list written on
          his wall (which is now composed of a dynamic cityscape of
          futuristic looking structures). He crosses "Abrams and
          Abrams" off the list. We notice several others are also
          crossed off.5. EXT GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAYTom has his car on the side of the road and is out measuring
          the distance between the beams of the bridge.8. EXT PARK - DAYTom jogs. A little faster this time.9. INT TOM'S BEDROOM - NIGHTTom getting more bad news from the answering machine,
          crossing off yet another firm from the list. Few remain. He
          sits on the bed with his shoulders slumped. For a beat, lost
          in thought.109.Then, as if to shut those thoughts out, whatever they were,
          he turns on the TV and joylessly watches the nothingness.9. SPLITSCREEN - DAYOn the LEFT, Tom, alone, on a bus. Looking out the window.
          Thinking.On the RIGHT, Summer. In her wedding dress. The veil is
          lifted. And she's a bride.END MUSIC.(478)EXT OFFICE BUILDING - ANOTHER DAYTom, in a suit, exits a building after another dismal
          interview. We can see he is frustrated but not deterred. In
          the distance, his favorite spot in the city, where he took
          Summer ages ago.EXT. PARK - DAYTom walks over and sits down on a bench. He stares off, lost
          in thought. And then, from out of nowhere, there's her voice.SUMMER (V.O.)Hey.Summer sits like an apparition on a neighboring bench. She
          may have just sat down, she may have been there for hours.
          Tom isn't sure if she's real. He doesn't quite know what to
          do.SUMMER(re: suit)
                       Where you coming from?TOMWhat? Oh. Nowhere. How long have
                       you been sitting there?SUMMERAwhile.Tom finds it hard to look at her.110.SUMMERI come here a lot. I always loved

                    congratulations.SUMMERProbably. But only if you mean it.TOMI don't know if I do honestly.SUMMERI understand.TOMYeah well...anyway...I hope you're
                    happy.SUMMERYou really do?TOM(BEAT)God no.They both laugh a little. The tension begins to dissipate.SUMMERHow are you, Tom?TOMI'm good. Ish.SUMMERThat's good.TOMYeah I quit the office.SUMMERReally? That's great! What are you

                    you.And there's not much else to say after that.Tom gets up to leave.TOMYou know what sucks? Realizing that
                    everything you believe in is

                    that stuff. It's nothing more than

                    Summer. You were right all along.Summer takes a beat to let this hang there.SUMMERI was right?And then, out of nowhere, she begins to hysterically laugh.TOMWhat? This is funny?113.Tries to stop but it only makes it worse. Now's she's
          completely cracking up.TOMWhat are you laughing at?And she can't stop. She's totally lost control.TOM(trying himself not toLAUGH)You're a crazy person!SUMMERTom! You're the crazy person!TOMWhat are you talking about?!SUMMEROne day I'm reading a book at the
                    corner deli and this guy sits down
                    and starts asking about it. Now
                    he's my husband!TOMThis is funny to you?SUMMERWhat would have happened if I went
                    to the movies instead? If I went
                    somewhere else for lunch? If I
                    showed up to eat ten minutes later?
                    Tom, it was meant to be, just like
                    you said. And as it was happening,
                    I knew it. I could feel it, sure as
                    the sun. And I kept thinking to
                    myself "Holy shit. Tom was right."
                    You were right about all of it.(BEAT)It just wasn't me you were right
                    about.Tom is speechless. Summer takes his hand. We may notice her
          wedding ring. We may also notice that this is the same exact
          shot as the first scene of the screenplay. We hold it for a
          few seconds more. And then, the hands separate.SUMMERAnyway, I should probably be
                    getting back. It was good to see
                    you. I'm glad you're well.114.Summer gets up and starts walking away from him. After aSECOND:TOMSummer!She stops and turns back. He takes in her face, most likely
          for the last time ever.TOMI really do hope you're happy.SUMMERI know.(BEAT)See you later.And she walks away. The CAMERA TRACKS AWAY with her, leaving
          Tom alone in the park, getting smaller and farther away every
          second.FADE OUT:A FEW SECONDS OF BLACK, BEFORE...FADE IN:(500)INT OFFICE WAITING AREA - DAYTom, in a suit, with a hefty batch of architecture sketches
          at his side, waits in the foyer of Allen, Prince, and Gethers
          Architecture. From the room we can tell this firm is big
          time.Tom waits.We notice, before he does, a VERY CUTE GIRL sitting in a
          another chair, also waiting. She smiles. He smiles back.GIRLAre you here to interview?TOMSorry?115.GIRLAre you interviewing? For the
                    position?TOMOh. Yeah. Why, are you?GIRLYup.TOMAh. My competition.GIRLIt would appear.TOMGee, this is a little awkward.GIRLYes it is.TOMWell, I hope you don't get it.GIRLI hope you don't get it.
          They both laugh. There's a silence for a few beats. And it's
          during this time that something weird comes over Tom and we
          can visibly see it in his face. He likes the look of this
          girl. This girl is cute. He'd like to talk more with her.
          And, honestly, he's a little surprised by it.TOMSo, uh...GIRLHmm?TOMAre you from...California?GIRLGrew up not too far from here.
                    Atherton, near Stanford.TOMI know Atherton. Nice area.GIRLHave I seen you before?116.TOMI, uh, don't know. I don't think

          and looks back at the girl.117.NARRATORIf Tom had learned anything... it
                    was that you can't ascribe great
                    cosmic significance to a simple
                    earthly event. Coincidence. That's
                    all anything ever is. Nothing more
                    than coincidence.ANIMATION. 1 second clip of the colored sequence. Real fast.
          Hardly noticeable. But it's there.NARRATORIt took a long time but Tom had
                    finally learned. There are no
                    miracles. There's no such thing as
                    fate. Nothing is meant to be. He
                    knew. He was sure of it now.(BEAT)Tom was...Tom turns back around.NARRATOR...pretty sure.TOM(to Girl)
