    champagne as they chat with their closest friends, JANE ANDJAKE.JANE is mid-fifties and has embraced that fact. She knows 50
    is not the new 40 and because of that, she is still described
    by all who know her as beautiful. Everything about this
    woman's appearance screams "solid."The years have been good to JAKE. He's never lost his looks,
    his killer smile, or his ability to charm. He lifts his

          long and you're divorced, so maybe
          you understand, when marriages end,
          there's doubts and hurt, and you've
          got kids and sometimes you wonder
          if you did the right thing and when
          the moment presented itself...ADAM-- I get it. I could imagine it...I
          could...JANEI told him it wasn't going to work
          between us but I guess he didn't
          believe me and unbeknownst to me,
          he showed up at my house yesterday.
          He left Agness and...ADAM-- Jane. I actually think I
          understand what happened
          but...uh...you know I'm not as
          macho as I appear and I think it's
          probably best for us not to get any
          more... involved because your
          relationship with Jake isn't really
          done and I know you're saying it
          is, but he's in love with you and
          for everyone's sake, that should
          probably get resolved.JANEWow.   So that's how grown ups talk.Adam smiles.JANEPlease tell me you're not going to
          quit my job and ask Peter to take
          over because then I'll never get to
          see you and...ADAMI was thinking of asking Peter to
          step back in.JANEOh... I hope you don't...ADAMThanks.114.128   OMIT                                                    128129   EXT. ROAD TO JANE'S HOUSE - LATE DAY                    129Jane drives home, when she notices Jake's Porsche in her
      driveway. She gets out of her car, finds Jake sitting on the
      bench swing hanging from a large oak in the front yard.Jane crosses to Jake. He moves over. Jane sees the humor in
      this gesture and sits on the swing with him, letting out a
      sigh. Side by side, they swing in the late afternoon breeze.JAKEI'm sorry.Jane doesn't answer right away.JANEHow far back does that sorry go?JAKEHow far back do you need it to go?JANEWay back.JAKEConsider it an all inclusive
                apology. From not being the
                husband you needed to showing up
                nude on your bed last night.JANEYeah, what were you thinking with
                that move?JAKEThat you'd find me irresistible.Jane turns to him, her eyes warming up to him.JAKENever considered the alternative.JANEGotta love that about you.They swing some more.115.JAKEOh, man, can't believe I got up to
bat again and blew it.JANEYou didn't blow it. We blew it.
We blew it the first time around.
This time... we just should've
known better. Too much has
happened. Too much time has passed.JAKEAnd you don't think we could make
it right?JANEDoes that mean you didn't feel it
was totally right either?JAKEBeing with you Jane is the best I'm
gonna be.JANEBut do you agree that it wasn't
really...?JAKEIt was complicated.JANEBegging for an answer.JAKEI thought it was good.   I wanted it
to be good.JANEGuess that's as close as I'm gonna             
get.JAKEDo you always have to be so hard on
me?JANENo.   I don't.JAKEI don't regret giving it another
shot.116.JANEProbably would've been better if
                you hadn't been married.JAKEIt may never have happened if I
                wasn't married.Jane looks at Jake, knowing how true that is. They sit, side       
      by side, as they sway in the breeze.JANEI don't regret it either.They continue rocking, not much more to say.   As CAMERA PULLS     
      AWAY, we:DISSOLVE TO:130   EXT. JANE'S HOUSE - MANY MORNINGS LATER                     130It's raining. Trucks are pulling into the driveway as lumber
      is being taken off of a truck and covered in tarps.Jane EXITS THE HOUSE in a parka and under an umbrella. A
      GROUP OF CONSTRUCTION GUYS ARE huddled under a make-shift          
      tarp. Jane crosses toward them and as the group opens to           
      face her she spots Adam, holding blue prints. Jane is              
      stunned he's there.ADAMGood morning.JANEGood morning.ADAMDid you know it's good luck to
                start building in the rain?JANEReally?ADAM(obviously lying)
                Yes. It's a well known, very good,
                really lucky omen.Thunder rattles the sky.117.JANE(looking up)
          Good, I could use one.
              (then)
          Would you all like to have your
          meeting in the house...it's dry and
          I've got hot coffee...The Group thanks her and heads for the house. Adam stays
back and walks next to Jane. It's a long second before
someone talks.ADAMJane, I need to ask you                                
          something...JANEAnything...ADAMYou wouldn't happen to have any of                     
          those amazing chocolate croissants,
          would you?JANEOh.... you like those, huh?ADAMI have incredibly fond memories of                     
          them.JANEI don't have any here, but we could                    
          go into town and get some... right                     
          out of the oven.                                       
They turn toward the house and on their backs we hear:ADAMYou want to do that?JANEYeah... love to.                                       
And as they walk away from Camera, we:SLOWLY FADE OUT
