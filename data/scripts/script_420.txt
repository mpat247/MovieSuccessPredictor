               cloud in the blue sky and the wind is at a standstill.

               Far in the distance, a MEDIUM SIZED FLAT-BED TRUCK makes its 
               way to the entrance of a large cavern opening. Two VULTURES 
               perched on a barren tree watch the intruders.EXT. DESERT -- DAYThe truck screeches to a dusty stop. Three men in matching 
               coveralls and hard hats jump from the cab: CHIEF (42, stocky, 
               weary), LANKY (32, withered) and COLLEGE BOY (23, clean cut 
               and naive).

               Chief holds a map and glares into the howling black mouth 
               before them.CHIEFThis is it.LANKYWhy did it have to be these caves...COLLEGE BOYIs something wrong?LANKY(to College Boy)
                         Don't mind me, buddy. It's nothin'.

               Chief grabs a flashlight and moves to the back of the truck.

               The logo on the rear gate reads "WIGWAM WASTE MANAGEMENT."CHIEFLet's get that first barrel.

               The gate drops revealing their full load of YELLOW BARRELS 
               bearing the familiar BIOHAZARD WASTE symbol.INT. CAVERN -- MOMENTS LATERCollege Boy and Lanky steer a cart loaded with the first 
               barrel inside. Chief's lone beam of light leads the men.COLLEGE BOYWhat's with the awkward silence?LANKYYou don't know?

               College Boy shakes his head "no" and they set the cart down.CHIEFLast winter, a man kidnapped a little 
                         girl and holed up in one of these 
                         caves. The cops had him pinned down 
                         and began to move in. This guy started 
                         shooting... but he wasn't aiming at 
                         the officers...

                         ...he was firing at something inside.

               College Boy is rapt.CHIEFWhen the dust cleared, all they found 
                         was the little girl's shoes.

                         With the feet still in 'em.

               Something GRABS College Boy's ankles, causing him to jump.COLLEGE BOYAhh!!!

               Lanky's on his knees, having grabbed him from behind. The 
               two men mockingly laugh. College boy settles, embarrassed.COLLEGE BOYAssholes.CHIEFHey, relax, I nearly shit myself 
                         when my boss pulled that one on me.LANKYI went well beyond nearly.

               Then, a sound. All eyes turn.CHIEFWhat was that?COLLEGE BOYOnce was plenty, fellas.CHIEFShhhh...

               As Chief moves forward, pulling out his pick-axe.

               Instantly, the cave is illuminated by a white floodlight. A 
               group of GREENPEACE HIPPIE ACTIVISTS stand in the cave, 
               CHAINED TOGETHER at the waist, startling the men into screams.

               MEAN GREEN (35, crooked glasses on a face that has launched 
               a thousand craps) barks into a MINI BULLHORN that hangs around 
               her neck. She charges towards Chief.MEAN GREENStop it right there! You will not 
                         rape Mother Nature one more day!

               Panicked, Chief drops his pick-axe and stumbles back.CHIEFWhoa! Whoa! Whoa!

               In unison, the hippies start CHANTING.HIPPIE GROUPMother Nature is not a whore/Don't 
                         dump in her any-more/Mother Nature

               A BEARDED CAMERAMAN with a huge KEY RING on his belt, films 
               the whole event. The three men are stopped in their tracks.CHIEFTake it easy! We have a permit!MEAN GREEN(handing a document)
                         And we have an injunction from the

                         caverns! This is virgin land! The 
                         aqueducts in these caves bring

                         its piping provides drainage for our

                         any kind! Not now! Not ever!

               Chief, shaken, confirms the injunction and hands it back.CHIEFFine, just back off!

               He snaps his fingers, motioning to the barrel.CHIEFLet's roll... Now-now-now!

               Backing away, looking to Mean Green.CHIEFHow do you guys always know where 
                         we're going?MEAN GREEN(with a smirk)
                         I'll tell ya next time! NOW MOVE IT!

               Hastily, the men roll the barrel out of the cave.MEAN GREENScore one for the green team!!!

               The hippies let out a spirited cheer. One pulls out a 
               tambourine, drums the beat for KUM BI YA. The rest join in 
               the victorious chant as they watch the three men hop in their 
               truck and peel away.BEARDED CAMERAMANHey, man, that was righteous, but I 
                         need a shot with the sign up.

               At the end of the human chain, an earthy woman, FUZZY, moves 
               to hang a GREENPEACE sign. Mean Green strokes the cave wall.MEAN GREENWe saved you today, ol' gal.

               Fuzzy hammers the sign in, but hits too hard, causing a breach 
               in the rock wall.FUZZYOh, fuck!MEAN GREENSister, why do you always swing for 
                         the fences?FUZZY(eyeing breach)
                         It's okay, but I... I think I see 
                         something in there... something shiny.

               Fuzzy puts her face up to the hole for a closer look. The 
               rest of the hippie-chain moves in closer.FUZZYOh my, it looks like diamonds!

               CHOMP! A set of giant, ravenous teeth bite into Fuzzy's skull. 
               Blood SPLATTERS on the hippies.

               Bearded Cameraman jumps to pull Fuzzy from the breach.

               Fuzzy's body is YANKED into the hole. The group tumbles 
               forward.

               Mean Green tries to stop herself from sliding, but can't.

               One by one, the hippies are being dragged to their death.

               Ripping, tearing, and howling echoes off the walls.

               Bearded Cameraman stumbles back. Mean Green spots him.MEAN GREENGive me the keys!!!

               Bearded Camerman just stares at her in shock. He's missing 
               both his arms.

               Mean Green lunges and grabs Chief's dropped pick-axe. She 
               HAMMERS at the chain around her waist.

               Foot by foot, she's dragged closer. At the last second, she 
               BREAKS the chain, popping herself free.

               She spins, running for safety. A guttural HOWL behind her 
               fills the cavern. Mean Green sprints toward the cave opening. 
               She's gonna make it. Only a few more feet. And then... JERK!

               Something grabs her neck and YANKS her back into the darkness.

               BURST! Trampy's rib cage is ripped from her body. The culprit, 
               UNCLE BEAST, stands behind her. Her organs drop like a box 
               of vegetables. Cousin Beast lets out a high-pitched roar. 
               From atop the truck, the rear doors are ripped open. Momma 
               Beast emerges.HEROINEGet to your cars!!!

               As Beer Guy looks forward, Aunt Beast and Uncle Beast hit

               from the open glove box and SAWS at his safety belt.

               Cousin Beast leans into the passenger side of the car and 
               looks him right in the eye. Bozo raises the knife.BOZOLord, if I die, bury me upside down

               yanks out Bartender's throat. The car veers.

               Tuffy rights it, leaning over and stomping on the gas. Momma 
               yanks at the door, pulling it open. Tuffy pushes out 
               Bartender's corpse and JERKS the wheel.IN THE BACKMomma Beast falls back, knocking down Heroine. Momma Beast 
               nearly falls out, but manages to grab the rear gate with one 
               claw. Defenseless, Heroine backs away. Momma Beast holds on 
               tightly, pulling herself onto the bed of the truck.

               Tuffy stares back through the glass, unable to do anything.

               Momma Beast lunges towards Heroine. Momma Beast's claw snags 
               Heroine's locket, jerking Heroine right up to the creature's 
               face. The locket catches Momma's attention for split second.

               Her remaining eye goes from the picture of Charlie to Heroine.

               Momma's mouth opens wide. Heroine screams!

               And then, a beam of the RISING SUN catches the gold locket 
               and burns into Momma's eye. In one quick motion, she's gone, 
               taking the locket with her.

               Heroine lets out her breath, reaching around her neck for 
               what is no longer there. The truck SKIDS to a halt. Tuffy 
               jumps out.TUFFYAre you okay?!HEROINEI don't know, I think --ADULTERER (O.S.)Hey!

               They both jump as Adulterer approaches.ADULTERERAre you two all right? They left! We

                         to find other people.

               Heroine rises and moves to the cab of the truck. She finds a 
               pack of cigs under the visor. Pops in the lighter.HEROINEYou know where the IGA grocery store 
                         is over in Red Mountain?ADULTERERUm, yeah, ten miles west.HEROINEThey have a bomb shelter.

               PING! The lighter springs out, hot. Heroine lights up and 
               passes one to Tuffy.HEROINEWe'll meet in three hours?ADULTERERI don't wanna go home alone... I

               Moment of silence as Adulterer and Tuffy look down the 
               desolate road.ADULTERERI'm sorry about your son. I really 
                         am.

               Tuffy nods, affectionately touching his hand.ADULTERERWhere are you two going?HEROINEWe're going to get my little girl.ADULTERERI wish you luck.

               The car peels off. Adulterer watches the car tear down the

               Heroine runs to her and the others follow. Charlie fidgets

               The group eyes Charlie, noticing Heroine's locket around her 
               ankle, leading to a slightly ajar manhole cover. Suddenly, 
               the sunlight starts to FADE. They look up the sun.TUFFYOh god.

               The MOON moves in front of it -- a SOLAR ECLIPSE. Beast 
               HISSING and FLUTTERING is heard. Heroine looks from left to

               The sunlight is fading. The manhole cover shakes, something

               Adulterer holds her at bay.ADULTERERIt's a trap!

               At a standstill, the group looks around for options. In the 
               distance, the darkness of the eclipse rolls towards them.

               Adulterer reacts, grabbing Tuffy's machete and lunging for 
               Charlie. The strike cuts the chain at her ankle. The manhole 
               cover POPS off and a Beast claw sinks into Adulterer.

               The darkness covers the manhole. Momma Beast rises, hoisting

               Tuffy grabs them both, leading them back towards the store 
               front. As Adulterer's blood flows, Momma Beast drags him 
               towards her main prey. 

               A blanket of darkness leads Momma Beast, overtaking the
