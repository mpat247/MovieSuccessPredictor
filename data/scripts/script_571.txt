          crowd of men dressed in exotically, yet identically colored shirts.
          They're members of the INTERAHAMWE - the Hutu Militia.3.(Interahamwe - the Hutu Militia will de distinguished by these wildly
          colored shirts) They chant, drink beer, dance onto the road,
          obstructing cars, threatening the occupants. Several of them perform a
          rhythmic dance - the INTERAHAMWE war dance to thumping drumbeat music
          from a boombox.PAUL (CONT'D)Turn off.Zozo, scared, looks for a side road, studies the traffic behind.ZOZOThere is nowhere to turn, sir.

          chains, Rolex watch, (like an African Mafia boss) but the same
          Interahamwe shirt. He squeezes an orange rind into a cup of espresso.Behind him, through his office window, the white van is being loaded
          with cases of beer.George holds out his massive shirt.GEORGEYou will join us at the rally today?Paul sits opposite, sipping coffee.4.PAULI will try my best George but these days
                      I have no time for rallies or politics.GEORGEPolitics is power, Paul. And money.Paul studies his watch.PAULTime is money, George. We need extra beer

          As a forklift lifts A WOODEN CRATE, George angers.GEORGE (CONT'D)Hell man, that is not beer, put it back!DRIVERBut, sir, the Carlsberg is behind...GEORGEForget the Carlsberg, give him Grolsch.
                           (to Paul)                                                
                      I won't charge extra.PAULThank you.The driver of the forklift, anxiously, spins the machine to return the
          crate but it slides off and CRASHES onto the floor: MACHETES, hundreds
          of them, spill out.An awkward moment then George picks one of the crude blades.GEORGEA bargain buy, from China. Ten cents

          same colorful uniform. Line after line, waves all performing the
          INTERAHAMWE war dance, in wild hypnotic sync, many wave sticks, spears,
          wooden imitation guns. A large banner reads, "Hutu Power."A flatbed truck, speakers blare drumbeat music. On it GEORGE RUTAGUNDA
          dances the DANCE and waves a machete to the crowd.Zozo sinks down behind the wheel.PAULSit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract
                      attention to yourself.ZOZOBoss, some of those men are my neighbors,
                      they know I'm Tutsi.The parade passes. As they wait Paul takes out the wad of notes George
