               known as Zordon, came to the city
               of Angel Grove to establish a
               vanguard in the never ending
               struggle against evil.  with the
               aid of his trusted assistant,
               Alpha 5, the noble master sought
               out six extraordinary teenagers
               and gave them the power to
               transform into an unstoppable
               fighting force.  In time of great
               need, the young heroes could now

               vehicles known as "Zords".  while

               courageous exploits soon became
               the stuff of Legend, earning them
               the title...  The Mighty Morphin

named MORDANT appear.RITAAnother Saturday night and I'm
               traipsing around the galaxy with
               the THREE LITTLE PIGS!  My mother
               warned me this would happen!
               Rita, she said, after 89
               marriages you might wanna think
               about throwing in the towel.  Why
               didn't I listen to her?!

Zedd grumbles to himself.ZEDDThat's a good question.

The stunned guard stirs his sleeping buddy.FIRST SECURITY GUARDUh... Kurt...  you might wanna
               take a look at this.

Kurt looks up groggily.ZEDDNo need to wake him.  In fact,
               why don't you take a little nap
               yourself.

Zedd ZAPS THE GUYS with a bolt from his staff -- they are
knocked out.

Goldar steps back from the blast and accidentally steps or
Mordant's foot.  Mordant KNOCKS on Goldar's metallic leg.MORDANTHey bonehead, get off my hoof!

Goldar is oblivious.  Zedd, stands reverently before the
glowing egg shape.ZEDDAfter two thousand years of
               searching...  I have finally
               found you.

               summer.RITAWell put a muzzle on him!

Mordant GRUMBLES under his breath.  Meanwhile, Zedd aims  is
staff at the chamber and BURSTS a blast of energy.  The egg
opens up with a wHOOSH of decompressing air.  webs of
ELECTRICITY BRANCH OUT, followed by a SWIRL OF BLACK SMOKE.

When the smoke clears we see a BUBBLING, PURPLE, PHOSPHOSCENT
OOZE.  The group gathers around -- Rita sticks a finger in  o
the sticky substance.RITAWhat... you spent two thousand
               years looking for this tub ofSNOT!As if in response, the ooze BOILS AND FROTHS.  Zedd and Rita
are too busy arguing to notice this.ZEDDDon't you ever have anything nice
               to say?!RITAWell, if I did I certainly
               wouldn't say it to you!

We hear a SLITHERING SLURPING SOUND as the substance RISES UP
AND TAKES ON THE GHASTLY SHAPE OF IVAN OOZE.  Mordant tugs at Zedd.MORDANTBoss.ZEDDFor your information this is not
               just your average, run-of-the-

Now he SMACKS his lips together, opens his arms theatrically
and gives his trademark stance.IVANLadies and Gentlemen... the OOZE

Rita blushes.RITAHe's so cute.

Zedd flashes her an angry look, turns back to Ivan.ZEDDI am Lord Zedd, sworn enemy of

               is a supreme honor to finally

Ivan gives a slight bow.IVANHow can I ever repay you?ZEDDDo you recall the name...  Zordon
               of Eltare?

Ivan's face goes dark, THUNDER RUMBLES and the site LIGHTS UP

A beast turns -- Aisha FLINGS dirt in his eyes.AISHAMy mistake.

She follows through with an OVER SHOULDER THROW --
the beast CRASHES INTO A JOHNNY-ON-THE-SPOT.

Rocky fights another beast and the creature SWINGS

Billy takes a hit, ROLLS across the ground.  He stops inches
away from a twenty foot drop-off.

The beast CHARGES HIM, he ducks and the beast GOES FLYINGTHROUGH THE AIR AND SPLASHES DOWN IN ONE OF THE MUDDY POOLSOF WATER.BILLYNot the brightest of beasts.

Rocky is now up in the scaffolding.  He DROPS TEN FEET through
the air, LANDS ON ONE END OF A BOARD.

There's a beast at the other end and he goes FLIPPING THROUGHTHE AIR.Tommy throws Saba Saber and the knife SWOOPS THROUGH THE AIR
and zings around the beasts as they try to knock him down.SABANa na na na na!

The rats chase after Saba as he heads into a water-slicked
area.  There's a large power cable running across it.  Once 
all the rats are in the water, Saba kamikaze dives into the
cable, SLICING IT OPEN WITH AN ERUPTION OF SPARKS.  The water
SIZZLES WITH ELECTRICITY and the rats GO UP IN A PUFF OF SMOKE.SABAFried mice, anyone?

We see the six original small rats scurry away, SQUEAKING.

Suddenly, there's an EXPLOSION OF ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY and the
Rangers watch, stunned, as their COSTUMES DE-MATERIALIZE and
they appear back in civilian clothes.KIMBERLYWhat's going on?!

Zordon closes his eyes.  Tommy puts a hand on Kimberly's
shoulder.  The kids slowly rise, all of them looking utterly
despondent.  Billy turns to Alpha.BILLYwhat're we going to do?ALPHA 5I do not LIKE Green Eggs and Ham!
               I do not like them, Sam-I-am!

Billy opens a panel on Alpha's back, makes an adjustment.

and removes a vile filled with RADIOLUMINESCENT ENERGY.ALPHA 5This is an emergency reserve of

               TIME for this.

As Rocky is talking, a flubbery looking SNOUT works it's way
over Kimberly's shoulder.  She hasn't noticed it yet.DULCEAYou don't understand.  If you do

lands on a rock directly above Tommy.  The bird fixes on Tommy
with its piercing eyes.

MOUTHS OPENING, THEIR ARMS REACHING UPWARD.  The beasts ROAROUT IN THUNDEROUS RAGE.Mordant's HAIR LITERALLY STANDS ON END -- he quickly retreats
behind a drum.

FRED looks on in horror.IVANPARENTS OF ANGEL GROVE.All of them turn their attention to Ivan.IVANYOU HAVE SERVED YOUR PURPOSE.NOW YOU WILL RETURN TO THECONSTRUCTION SITE AND LEAP TOYOUR DEMISE!The parents just stand there with blank expressions.IVANWhat're you waiting for??...

Goldar taps him on the shoulder and he spins around.IVANWhat!GOLDARYou forgot to say 'Simon says."

Ivan shakes his head dismally.67   EXT.  ROPE BRIDGE -  DAY                              67The Rangers crest a hill and Adam, who's in the lead, suddenly
drops down - the others following suit.

They peer over the ridge -- their eyes wide.

Before them, a tenuous rope bridge leads to a vast rock landing.
The ocean RAGES BELOW.

On top of the island is the Nathadian Monolith.  It's a  mind-
boggling wonder from another time and place.

Between the Rangers and the bridge, the Tengu Warriors are on
patrol.KIMBERLYMan, these are the last guys I
               wanted to see.AISHAWhadda we do now?

Kimberly surveys the area.BILLYThat's the only way to the
               Monolith...ROCKYWe can take these guys!

Tommy pulls all of them into a huddle.68   EXT.  ROPE BRIDGE -  DAY                                  68The Tengu are on full alert.  One of them hears something,
snaps around, there's nothing there.

Another Tengu looks down as a frog hops between his leg.  He
SCREECHES and STOMPS down his taloned foot, missing the     
creature by inches.

We hear a CAW and the Queen Tengu squints as she spots a falcon
circling in the sky above.  The Queen is perched on top of a 20
foot rock face. She looks around hesitantly.

Now the Rangers ATTACK, some of them LUNGING OFF ROCKS, others
BURSTING out of crevices, others coming over the walls.

Billy wields his WHISTLING sticks -- misses several times, then
starts BASHING and THWACKING the feathered beasts.

The Queen SHOOTS A LASER BLAST from her eyes -- it EXPLODES
before Tommy.

Kimberly battles another Tengu and the creature forces her back
on to the rickety bridge.

The Queen FIRES ANOTHER BLAST.ROCKYLOOK OUT!Rocky DIVES, knocking Aisha away from the bolt.

Adam and one of the Tengu circle each other warily.ADAMThe frog silently assesses its
               target, then strikes out...

Suddenly the Tengu is HURTLED BACKWARD TEN FEET THROUGH THE
AIR.  We didn't even see Adam move.ADAM... in the blink of an eye.

Tommy steps up behind a Tengu.TOMMYYo, Tweety!

The Tengu turns around and Tommy WHALLOPS HIM WITH A SPINNING-
HEEL KICK.  A Tengu faces down Aisha and she goes into a bear
stance.AISHAThe bear is sturdy as a towering
               tree.  Nothing can uproot it.

The Tengu CHARGES LIKE A BULL, SLAMS INTO AISHA.  She holds
fast and the bird EXPLODES INTO A CLOUD OF FEATHERS.AISHABye, bye birdy.

Kimberly continues balancing precariously on the bridge as she
EXCHANGES BLOWS with her foe.

She finally drops into a crane stance... then just like Dulcea
she LEAPS THROUGH THE AIR, EXECUTES A BRUTAL SPINNING HELL KICK
and sends the birdman TUMBLING OFF THE BRIDGE.

In a movement that seems to defy gravity, she lands perfcctly
back on the swinging bridge.KIMBERLYHasta la Pasta, Bigbird!

Billy swings his sticks, BASHES one of the Tengu in the beak --
the creature EXPLODES INTO A CLOUD OF FEATHERS!BILLYAIM FOR THEIR BEAKS!Tommy reaches the top of a rack.  He sees a Tengu making aKAMIKAZE DIVE TOWARD KIMBERLY.  TOMMY DIVES, SOARING THIRTYFEET THROUGH THE AIR -- HE INTERCEPTS THE TENGU AND THEY SPINTOWARD EARTH TOGETHER.  They HIT the ground and EXCHANGE BLOWSAS THEY FALL OVER ONE ANOTHER.Rocky SLAMS another Tengu in the beak, KABLAM  -- the creature
is OBLITERATED.

Tommy LEAPS INTO THE AIR, NAILS two Tengu in the beaks.  TheyBOTH BURST IN AN EXPLOSION OF FEATHERS.The Queen shoots another BOLT OF ENERGY --  a rock EXPLODES,
SHOWERING THE KIDS WITH SHRAPNEL.  Aisha turns to Rocky.AISHAIt's up to you.

Rocky takes a deep breath, goes into a crouch position.
Incredibly he SCALES THE WALL IN THE SAME WAY HE WENT UP THE
POLE.  HE FLIPS OVER THE TOP and lands right before the Queen
Tengu.  He looks her dead in the eye.ROCKYPolly wanna cracker?

With that, he executes a devastating SPINNING-HEEL KICK and the
Queen BURSTS INTO OBLIVION.KIMBERLYALL RIGHT, ROCKY!Instantly, the remaining Tengu retreat, SQUAWKING and CAWWING  in
rage.  The kids turn to eaeh other, sharing in a moment of triumph.ADAMWE DID IT!!72   EXT.  ANGEL GROVE TOWER - DAY                               72We're on top of a high tower overlooking the entire city

huge black Monolith.  There's all sorts of charred bones and
skeletons strewn around it, some of them human, some of them
alien.

They approach the massive block, stand before it in awe struck
silence.  In the middle of the Monolith there's a large circle
with the six animals of the Ninjetti carved into it.ROCKY... The Nathadian Monolith...

Kimberly looks at all the bones -- instinctively puts her hand
on her animal symbol.KIMBERLYI guess these guys weren't so
               lucky.

A few of the kids walk around the Monolith, examining it more
closely.AISHAWe've come all this way for a
               rock wall?!BILLYThere should be a way to open it.

Billy &;Tommy latch their hands over the block, searching for
an opening.BILLY... Nothing.ROCKYRelease the power with the power.

Rocky steps back, THROWS HIS SHOULDER into the Monolith with a
THUMP, winces in pain.AISHANot that kind of power.

The kids exchange discouraged looks.BILLY... There has to be something
               we're missing.

Suddenly a SIZZLE OF ELECTRICITY forms in front of them.KIMBERLYWhat NOW!

The kids mouth's fall open as... a HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGE OF
ZORDON'S WITHERED FACE APPEARS.  He speaks in a barely
audible voice.ZORDONRangers... Ivan has invaded the

lifeless form looking absolutely devastated.KIMBERLY... This can't be...

utterly defeated.
