                                          August 30th, 2007INT. EXAM ROOM - DAYWe're not exactly sure where we are. And we're not exactly
sure who's talking. All we know is that we are looking at a
foot. One bare foot with chipped red polish.ZOE (V.O.)I can't believe I didn't get a
          pedicure for this. How
          embarrassing. Look at that...

The toes open and then curl down as if trying to hide.ZOE (V.O.)(CONT'D)What's wrong with me? If I were
          with a real guy doing this, I
          would've gotten a pedicure. And a
          wax. I'm pathetic.

The CAMERA PANS to the other foot, which is also chipped.ZOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)Fuck, that one's even worse. And
          when did my toes get so fat? No
          wonder I'm alone. I'm a fat-toed
          animal.

Zoe lets out a sigh.    She speaks out-loud now.ZOE (CONT'D)Sorry I didn't get a pedicure.DR. HARRISWhat?

DR. HARRIS (mid-fifties, jovial) looks up from between Zoe's
knees, the light on his head flashing right in Zoe's eyes.ZOEMy toes...sorry.DR. HARRISI'm not looking at your toes.ZOERight.   Duh.

Dr. Harris stands and takes off his gloves.DR. HARRISAll done.2.ZOEThat's it?

And now, for the first time, we see ZOE. Despite the paper
gown and worried look on her face, she's a late-30-something,
girl-next-door type. She could be your best friend.DR. HARRISI'll elevate your legs for ten
          minutes and then you're good to go.

He sets a kitchen timer and then pushes a button to raise her
legs. We hear the loud TICK TOCK of the timer.ZOEThis is the first time I've heard
          that ticking clock sound and it
          doesn't freak me out.DR. HARRISGood.   Just relax.ZOEI can't, I'm totally freaking out.DR. HARRISEverything's going to be great. I
          have a feeling you and...
              (checks empty syringe)
          Number CRM-101404 are going to make
          beautiful babies together.

Zoe smiles.   Maybe he's right.   Yeah...of course he's right.BOBBY (V.O.)Number CRM-101404? Are you high?INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAYTITLE UP: FOUR WEEKS AGOBOBBY, 39 (but says he's 33,) gay and gorgeous, opens a file
and points to a piece of paper.BOBBYSays here he has red hair and
          freckles.ZOEAnd glasses, too.BOBBYAnd why are we picking him?3.ZOEBecause he's honest.BOBBYHe's ugly.

Zoe points to a stack of potential donors.ZOEYou think they're all telling the
          truth? If they're so smart and
          good looking, why are they beating
          off into a cup?BOBBYHave you ever fucked a guy with red
          hair and freckles?ZOENo, and I won't have to.BOBBYBut what about your kid? No one's
          going to want to fuck your kid.
              (beat)
          That came out wrong.ZOEYeah...it's a good thing you're not
          going to be the father.INT. WAVERLY INN   - NIGHTTITLE UP: EIGHT WEEKS AGOBobby spits out a mouthful of Sauvignon Blanc.BOBBYWhat?    I can't be the father!ZOECome on, we don't have to have sex.BOBBYOh, Jesus, I didn't even think
          about that. Rewind, rewind,
          rewind...ZOEYou're one of my best friends.
          Don't you want to help me?4.BOBBYYeah, but...that's too much. I'll
          walk your dog, tell you when you
          look fat, be honest about your
          eyebrows...ZOEJust a few sperm. Big deal. You
          waste billions of them every night.BOBBYYou know I flee at the slightest
          chance of intimacy. Do you see
          these bags under my eyes? Ricardo
          slept over last night, and he
          wanted to hold me. I actually had
          to fake a seizure.ZOEForget it.     Forget the whole thing.

Zoe sighs and puts her head in her hands.MONA (V.O.)Forget the whole thing.    It's just
          a phase...INT. MONA'S APARTMENT - NIGHTTITLE UP: TWELVE WEEKS AGO.Zoe and MONA, Zoe's age but looks much older, sit at the
kitchen table.MONAYou don't want kids.    Trust me.ZOEEasy for you to say.    You have
          four.MONAYeah, and it's awful.

Three CHILDREN run through the kitchen yelling and screaming.
A beat later, a TODDLER runs after them crying.MONA (CONT'D)They've ruined my life.ZOECome on...5.MONAHave you seen my vagina?

Zoe shakes her head.MONA (CONT'D)Do you want to?

Zoe shakes her head again.MONA (CONT'D)I would do that for you. To prove
          to you that you don't want to have
          kids, I will show you my vagina.ZOEI don't want to see your vagina.    I
          want a baby. My own baby.MONAIs it possible you're just a little
          lonely? You know, you haven't met
          the right guy and--ZOEIt's not about a guy. I don't need
          a guy. I don't even think I want a
          guy at this point. I've dated a
          hundred guys in the last five
          years, and not one of them is even
          close to being the one. How long
          am I supposed to wait?MONAYou never know. He could be right
          around the corner.ZOEWell, then he's late. And I hate
          people who are late. And what if
          he's not right around the corner?
          What if he's miles away?

Zoe shakes her head.   She becomes very serious.ZOE (CONT'D)I want to have a baby. And time is
          running out. I hear a clock
          ticking every time I close my eyes.
          I need it to stop.

We hear a loud DING.6.INT. EXAM ROOM - DAYZoe opens her eyes. We're back in the exam room.      She looks
at the timer, which just hit zero. She smiles.ZOEDing.

Then a tear forms in the corner of her eye. She wipes it
away. She wipes a tear from the other eye. Happy tears.
Then she looks at her legs high above her on the table.ZOE (CONT'D)How the fuck am I supposed to get
          down from here?INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE HALLWAY - LATERZoe walks down the hall with her legs pressed firmly
together, moving only from the knees down. Dr. Harris
passes.DR. HARRISYou don't have to walk like that.ZOEOh.   Okay.

Zoe separates her legs an inch.     And then closes them.ZOE (CONT'D)Should we hug? We might have just
          made a baby together.INT. WAITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATERZoe walks through the waiting room with her legs still
pressed together. She sees two PREGNANT WOMAN, touches her
own stomach and smiles. She finally feels part of this
exclusive baby club.ZOEHi.PREGNANT WOMENHi.INT. ELEVATOR - DAYZoe enters the elevator where there is a WOMAN holding a
BABY. Zoe smiles at them. Another member of the club...7.ZOEHi.WOMANHi.

The elevator descends. Zoe continues to stare at the baby
with a big smile. She stares for an uncomfortably long time.WOMAN (CONT'D)You're starting to freak me out.ZOESorry.

Zoe looks down.    After a beat, she sneaks another look.WOMANStop it.EXT. MADISON AVENUE - DAYIt's POURING outside. The kind of rain that turns umbrellas
inside out. NEW YORKERS run for cover with newspapers over
their heads.

Despite the rain, Zoe skips out of the building with her
hands in the air and twirls around. Realizing that she's
spread her legs too far apart, she snaps them back together.

A WOMAN pushing a baby stroller covered in plastic runs by.ZOEHi!

Zoe looks uptown for a cab. Nope. Nothing. She starts to
walk, still keeping her legs firmly pressed together. She
rounds the corner towards the subway station and then,
miraculously, spies a cab.ZOE (CONT'D)Taxi!

She runs (little steps) across the street.INT. TAXI - MOMENTS LATERZoe closes the door behind her.ZOEHallelujah!8.As soon as the word comes out of her mouth, she notices
someone entering the cab from the other side.

This is STAN, early 40s, but looks more like a college kid --
faded jeans, t-shirt, cute, messy hair.ZOE (CONT'D)Uh...excuse me. This is my cab.STANYou own it?ZOENo, but I'm about to rent it.STANActually, if we're being technical,
          you kind of stole it.ZOEI don't think so.STANIf you see someone about to get in
          a cab, you can't just run in from
          the other side and say it's yours.ZOEI didn't see you.STANI saw you see me.ZOE(to the cabbie)
          Sir, who saw you first?

The CABBIE picks up his paper and starts to read.STANMaybe you're not from around here,
          but there's a code. It's like war,
          even though it's brutal and bloody,
          there are still certain rules we--ZOEFine.   Forget it.   I'll get out.

Zoe grabs the door handle and then turns back.ZOE (CONT'D)But not because you're right, but
          because I am in a terrific mood,
          and you are ruining it.9.STANNo.   I'll get out.

They each get out.EXT. TAXI - CONTINUOUSZoe and Stan stand on opposite sides of the taxi in the
POURING RAIN. Zoe crosses her arms.ZOENow what?STANI don't know. You tell me.

That question is answered by the cabbie, who now peels out.ZOEWhat? Where's he going?!
              (waving her hands, then)
          Come back!

They both stand there with a taxi's width between them.ZOE (CONT'D)Well, that was stupid. Why'd you
          get out, you, stupid-head?STANYou said you were in a great mood
          and I was ruining it. I felt bad.
              (then)
          Did you just call me stupid-head?

Zoe storms off with her little steps.INT. 68TH STREET SUBWAY STATION - DAYStan and Zoe each swipe their Metrocards at the same time.

They enter the subway platform which is jam packed with all
the other NEW YORKERS who are shit-out-of-luck in the cab
department. Rain droplets drip from the ceiling above.ZOEOh, man...STANHow's your great mood now?10.INT. 6 TRAIN - DAYA packed subway car. Zoe and Stan are back-to-back, pushed
together by the crowd. Zoe tries to read her paper.STANHow `bout now?ZOEPlease stop talking to me.INT. UNION SQUARE SUBWAY STATION - DAYZoe and Stan walk up the stairs a few feet apart from each
other. Zoe does her best to ignore the obvious.STANSo, why are you in such a good mood
          anyway?

They reach the top of the stairs. The rain has stopped, and
the sun is just starting to peek through. Everything is wet
and has a magical quality.ZOENot that it's any of your business,
          but...good things are happening to
          me.

Stan is moved by this.   What a thing to say.STANThat's nice. I hope it continues.ZOEThanks. Well, have a nice life.
          Try not to steal any more cabs.STANYou do the same.

They nod and separate.INT. HUDSON PETS - DAYHudson Pets is a small but quaint West Village pet store
filled with dogs, cats and a few rabbits.

Zoe enters. Her dog, NUTS, a raggedy, pug-like dog with hind
legs in a WHEELCHAIR, bounds/wheels towards her, barking.11.ZOEHey, Nutsy. How's it going?

She gives Nuts a good scratch. JALISA, mid-30s, Latina
hottie, and Bobby run from the back.BOBBYOh, my God, you're glowing.
              (to Jalisa)
          She's glowing, right?JALISAGlowing.   Tell us everything.BOBBYEverything.ZOEThere's not much to tell.BOBBYYou just got shot up with a wad of
          red-headed-freckle sperm. There's
          something to tell.JALISAHe had red hair and freckles?BOBBYI tried to talk her out of it.JALISAWhy'd you do that, Mami?BOBBY(to Jalisa)
          I know, right?JALISARed pubes.     Eek...ZOEI'm never going to see his pubes!BOBBYYou'll see your kid's pubes.ZOEI doubt it.BOBBYBut you'll know they're there.12.ZOEWhat is wrong with you?JALISASo, what happened?    Come on...ZOEI lay down, put my feet up, five
          minutes later it was over. I
          barely felt a thing.BOBBYSounds like Ricardo.JALISATell me about it, Papi.

Bobby and Jalisa high five.    Bobby then turns to Zoe.BOBBYSo...what happens now?ZOENow, we wait.BOBBYThat's no fun, I want to know if
          I'm going to be a fairy godmother.ZOEWe'll just have to wait and see.

Zoe smiles and heads for the back.EXT. HUDSON PETS - NIGHTThe lights in the pet store go dark.   Moments later, Zoe,
Bobby, Jalisa and Nuts exit.BOBBYCome on, Zoe, one drink. You can
          have an O'Dhouls or something.JALISAWe'll go to the piano bar and get
          Bobby to sing some Ace of Base.BOBBYForget it, she's not coming. I can
          tell by the dull look on her face.ZOELove you.13.They all hug.   Bobby and Jalisa walk away arm-in-arm,
singing.BOBBY/JALISAI saw the sign and it opened up my
          eyes, I saw the sign...

Zoe turns to lock up.   While her back is turned, Stan appears
from the shadows.STANHi.ZOEAahhh!

Zoe screams and drops the keys. Nuts, overexcited by Zoe's
reaction, starts to run/wheel in circles and then tips over.ZOE (CONT'D)You scared the hell out of me!STANOh, wow.   Is he...okay?

Nuts is still on the ground, his wheels spinning.   Zoe sets
him upright.ZOEWhat are you doing here?STANI'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare
          you. Or hurt your dog. Don't
          worry, I'm not a stalker.ZOEHow'd you know I worked here?STANI followed you after the subway.
              (thinks, then)
          That sounds a little stalkery, huh?ZOEYeah.STANI just really wanted to see you
          again. Almost like I had to see
          you again. Can I walk you home?
              (then)
          Is it me or does everything I say
          make me sound more like a stalker?14.Zoe allows a small smile.STAN (CONT'D)Can I just give you my card? Here.
          Take my card. I'm not a freak.
          Really. I sell cheese.

This hangs out there for a beat.ZOECheese?STANYeah. My family has a goat farm.
          We make cheese. You like cheese?ZOEI guess. I've never really thought
          about it.STANLittle Goat. Maybe you've seen us
          at the Farmer's market? Come by
          sometime and you can taste my
          cheese.
              (then)
          Okay, I'm going to go. This has
          not gone as planned.

Stan smiles meekly and then turns to go.ZOEBye.

Stan lifts his hand to wave but doesn't even turn around.
Clearly, he feels like an idiot. Zoe watches him go.EXT. WEST VILLAGE BROWNSTONE - MORNINGEstablishing shot of a cute brownstone with window boxes and
a front stoop. We TILT UP to the third floor window.INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - MORNINGZoe is asleep with the morning sun on her face. Nuts is
beside her, his two little, lame legs hanging off the pillow.
Zoe opens her eyes.

After a beat, she gets up and walks to the mirror. She lifts
up her pajama top and looks at her stomach, sticking it out
as far as it will go. It's flat as a board.15.INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - DAYSeven WOMEN sit around the cramped living room of this small,
East Village apartment. At least one woman is nursing a
child that looks entirely too old to still be nursing.

This is the SINGLE MOTHERS BY CHOICE Support Group. CAROL,
40's, short hair, tank top and no bra, is the leader.CAROLEveryone, please say hello to Zoe.EVERYONEHi, Zoe.CAROLWelcome to Single Mother's By
          Choice. As the name suggests, we
          are all single mothers by choice.
          Some of us have adopted, some
          conceived with a donor, every story
          is different, but with the same
          common denominator. We wanted to
          have a child, and we didn't need a
          partner to make it happen.

The women smile and nod. They are a proud, no-nonsense,
somewhat masculine bunch. LORI, pregnant with a buzz cut,
turns to Zoe.LORIAre you a doer or a tryer?ZOEExcuse me?LORIAre you already a single mother or
          are you trying to become one?ZOEOh, I guess I'm trying. I was just
          inseminated a few days ago.
              (then)
          Inseminated...makes me feel like a
          cow or something.CAROLWell, when we don't have partners
          with penises, we do what we've got
          to do, right?
              (then)
          So, tell us a little bit about
          yourself.16.ZOEOkay. Let's see...um, I own a pet
          store on Hudson Street. Dogs,
          cats, rabbits...no birds, they
          creep me out. Before that, I
          worked for Google, which I
          completely hated. One day, I
          decided life was too short, and,
          against my accountant's advice, I
          quit Google, cashed out and bought
          the pet store. Now I'm really
          happy on the work front, but I
          still haven't found, you know, the
          one.CAROLAh, yes.   The elusive "one."ZOEI always imagined I'd be married
          with kids by now, but it doesn't
          look like it's going to happen that
          way. So, time for Plan B.CAROLSociety tells us we're supposed to
          find that special person to make us
          happy and complete. But guess
          what...you have to create your own
          happiness. You don't need someone
          to complete you, some...man. You
          already are complete.LORIAmen, sister.CAROLIf you want to have a baby, we here
          at Single Mothers By Choice can be
          your partners. We will be your
          emotional rocks.

Zoe looks around at her new "partners." There's SARA, the
one nursing the toddler. And TABITHA, a tall women with an
even taller afro and a nose ring. BRIDGET, a young girl
covered in tatoos. And several more...CAROL (CONT'D)From inception to college
          graduation and everything in
          between. We're here for each
          other.

Sara smiles and nods at her nursing child.17.SARADakota was actually born right here
          in this very room. Right where
          you're sitting, actually.ZOE(uncomfortable)
          Really? Right here?      Imagine that.SARABest day of my life.ZOEAnd how old is she now?

Dakota looks up from the breast.DAKOTAI'm three.INT. LE PAIN QUOTIDIEN - DAYZoe and Mona are sitting by the window sharing a plate of
pastries and a pot of coffee.MONAWhy did you join a support group of
          unattractive, militant lesbians
          when you have me?ZOEBecause you're really not that
          supportive.MONASure I am.ZOEYou just told me that if I breast-
          feed "my girls" will end up looking
          like empty tube socks.MONAI'm just being honest. And don't
          even get me started on what
          childbirth does to your bladder.ZOEWhat does it do to your bladder?

Mona cracks up and then stops abruptly.18.MONAI just peed a little bit.ZOEI don't think I'm pregnant. The
          doctor says it will probably take
          several tries. Something about
          frozen sperm being lazy.MONAGood.   Take your time.

Zoe takes a sip of coffee and looks out the window.ZOESo, should I call this guy?   Do you
          think that would be weird?MONADo I think it's weird that you're
          pursuing someone at the exact
          moment in time that you might be
          most unavailable? No. Because
          that's what you do. You sabotage.ZOE(ignoring her)
          He works at the Farmer's market.
          And it's right around the corner.
          Are you thinking what I'm thinking?MONAI look fat and old?ZOENo.MONAThen, no.ZOELet's go spy on him. Come on. It
          will be fun. Like high school.MONAI can't.
              (checks watch)
          This twenty minute breakfast
          concludes my "me" time for the
          week. More proof that you should
          not have kids.19.EXT. FARMER'S MARKET - DAYThe Farmer's Market is crowded with people. We hear the
sounds of a bluegrass band playing somewhere nearby.

Zoe spies the LITTLE GOAT sign. But Stan is not there.    She
looks around the neighboring stalls for him, but no luck.ZOEOh, well.

She walks towards 14th street. We see the bluegrass band on
the steps by the subway station. It's not a big band, just a
few guys with an open banjo case and a sign that reads, "The
Organics." The country twang of the music is in sharp
contrast with the tall buildings all around.

As she gets closer, she notices that Stan is in the band.
He's playing banjo.

Zoe quickly ducks into the nearest food stall, OLIVIA'S
BERRIES. OLIVIA, mid-twenties, natural beauty, approaches.OLIVIACan I help you?ZOE(distracted)
          No, I'm fine.

Zoe watches Stan. She mindlessly starts eating some
blueberries out of the display pint. Olivia sees that Zoe is
looking at Stan.OLIVIATasty, huh?

Zoe nods and takes another berry.OLIVIA (CONT'D)All ripe and juicy. And firm, too.
          Bet you could just eat him up in
          one bite, right?

Zoe now turns, confused.ZOEWhat?OLIVIAAnd don't look now, but he's coming
          this way.20.Olivia winks and moves off. Zoe turns back and is now face-
to-face with Stan, who's smiling from ear-to-ear, his banjo
slung over his shoulder.STANA-ha! I didn't scare you away
          after all.ZOE(trying to be casual)
          I was just in the neighborhood. I
          thought I'd come by and get some
          blueberries. I'm going to make a
          pie.STANI love blueberry pie.

Stan takes two pints of blueberries and hands them to Zoe.ZOEI'm confused. I thought you made
          cheese or something.STANWhat makes you think I don't?ZOEI don't know, you're over there

Stan puts his arm around Zoe and leads her away.   Olivia
watches them go with her arms crossed.21.EXT. THE LITTLE GOAT CHEESE STAND - LATERStan walks Zoe through his cheese stand.STANThis is our basic chevre, probably
          our best seller. The cheese that
          started it all, as they say. Then
          over here we have our surface-
          ripened cheeses. These are the
          aged/raw milk cheeses.
              (realizing)
          This is really boring, huh?ZOENo, not at all.STANIt's like you're in a foreign
          country and the only thing to watch
          on tv is a documentary on cheese.
          You don't want to watch it, but
          somehow you can't stop...ZOE(laughing)
          I think it's interesting.    Really.STANAll right, you asked for it...
              (boring voice)
          The aged/raw milk cheeses are made
          from raw milk and then aged for
          four to six months. Sometimes
          more. Sometimes less. Usually
          more. Depends on the cheese.FREDStop.   You're killing me.

FRED, early twenties, white guy with Rasta-type dreads, looks
up from behind the counter.STANFred, Zoe, Zoe, Fred.

          You look like a doofus.STANDoofus?
              (then, to Zoe)
          Do you think I look like a doofus?ZOEI don't really know what a doofus
          looks like.

Fred points to Stan.STANOkay. If I put the banjo down, can
          I take you to lunch or something?ZOEI should really get back to work.STANCome on, say the word and we can
          have a six-course tasting menu at
          Union Square Cafe. I know the
          chef.ZOEThat sounds nice, but, I should
          probably go.STANWell, can I call you?

Zoe smiles.INT. HUDSON PETS - DAYZoe enters the pet store with two big bags of vegetables. As
soon as she steps foot in the store, Bobby and Jalisa accost
her.23.BOBBYOkay, spill it.JALISAWho is he? What does he do?    How
do we know him?ZOEWhat are you talking about?JALISAStan from the Farmer's Market?
He's called twice already.ZOEReally?BOBBYIs he a farmer? Because that's not
okay.ZOENo.   He makes cheese.BOBBYHe's a pilgrim?ZOEI don't know what he is. He's cute
and different and plays the banjo.
    (then)
I think I like him.BOBBYWhat about the, you know, bun in
the oven?ZOEI really doubt I'm pregnant.JALISAYou want to be pregnant. You don't
want to be pregnant. I'm confused.ZOEI want to be pregnant. Of course I
want to be pregnant. I mean, I put
a lot of thought into this, right?
    (then)
So what did Stan say?BOBBYHe says to name any restaurant you
want to go to.(MORE)24.BOBBY (CONT'D)He'll be there with bells on.
              (then)
          He didn't say the "bells on" part.
          I added that. Sounds a little too
          gay, though, so I take it back.EXT. 8TH STREET - NIGHTZoe walks down 8th street. This is the first time we've seen
her really pulled together, and she looks hot. She turns
into the restaurant she's chosen for the big date.INT. GRAY'S PAPAYA HOT DOGS - NIGHTZoe and Stan stand at the counter with an array of hot dogs
in front of them. Stan looks at the hot dogs skeptically.STANWe could have gone anywhere.ZOEJust take a bite.   You'll see.STANPer Se, Jean Georges, Nobu...ZOEGray's Papaya.   Cheers.

She clinks his dog and then they each take a bite.ZOE (CONT'D)Good, right?

Stan nods, covering his mouth because the bite is so big.ZOE (CONT'D)You've lived here your whole life
          and never been to Gray's Papaya.
          What's wrong with you?STANI actually haven't lived here my
          whole life. We moved out of the
          city when my parents bought the
          farm....not died, but actually
          bought a farm and moved upstate.ZOEThat must have been a nice place to
          grow up. On a farm.25.STANWhat about your family?ZOEIt's just me and my grandmother.
          She lives in a retirement community
          in Queens.
              (an awkward beat)
          My parents died when I was young.STANI'm so sorry.

There is a long silence.   They both stare at the hot dogs.STAN (CONT'D)I don't know what to say now.    I've
          made it all awkward and sad.ZOEIt's okay.
              (then)
          My dad was kind of a bad guy,
          anyway.STANShit.   I'm so sorry, Zoe.ZOENo, come on, we'll get all this
          stuff out of the way so we never
          have to talk about it again. Let's
          ask all the awkward, get-to-know-
          you questions right now.STANOkay.   Good idea.ZOELet's see...are you religious?STANNope.   What about you?ZOENo.STANHave you ever been married?ZOENo.26.STANAren't you sick of going to
            weddings?ZOEIf I have to listen to one more
            couple write their own vows...STANI hate when they write their own
            vows!

They clasp hands. Not in a high-fivey way, but in a
connected, we have so much in common way. Their hands stay
together, feeling the charge between them.STAN (CONT'D)What about kids?

Zoe feels the blood rush to her cheeks.   Like everyone there
must now be looking at her.ZOEWhat about them?STANWell, do you want them?ZOEYeah.   I want kids.

She pulls her hand away. This has all gotten suddenly real.
She looks at Stan, almost afraid to ask the next question.ZOE (CONT'D)Do you?STANYeah.   Absolutely.

Zoe nods.   Slowly, she starts to breathe again.EXT. PERRY STREET - NIGHTThey are now walking home together, arm-in-arm.ZOEOkay, first kiss...STANJen Salzer. Seventh grade. She

Stan interrupts by kissing her. And it's a great kiss. Full
of promises and answers. They linger there for a moment...ZOE (CONT'D)That was way better.STANWhen can I see you again?

sun is shining and they are both waking up.

She gets up and goes to the mirror. She lifts up her
nightgown and looks at her stomach, this time with a slight
look of concern on her face.INT. EQUINOX - DAYZoe and Mona are side-by-side on the elliptical machines.
Zoe is going very fast, while Mona is barely moving at all.ZOEWhat if I'm pregnant?MONAThen you'll get fat and hormonal
          and I'll say, "I told you so."ZOEBut what if this could go somewhere
          with Stan? Like, really go
          somewhere.MONAThen it will work out perfectly.ZOEWhat do you mean?MONABecause just when you really like
          him, you'll break up because you're
          pregnant and then you never have to
          put yourself out there and possibly
          get hurt. That's your dream.28.ZOE(thinks, then)

          That's the last thing we need. You
          get knocked up and we'll have no
          idea who the father is.

A few women look over.MONA (CONT'D)And then we'll have to do a
          paternity test. Is it the cheese
          farmer or the red-pubed bandit?

More women look over.ZOEI'm not going to have sex with him
          tonight. It's too soon.
              (for the women's benefit)
          I'm not a slut.MONAWell, bring condoms, just in case.

We hear the doorbell RING.ZOE (CONT'D)Shit.

Zoe looks down at the test. Still nothing.      We wait and
watch the test. The doorbell RINGS again.ZOE (CONT'D)Shit!

A faint PLUS SIGN is forming.ZOE (CONT'D)Shitshitshitshit...

The plus sign then turns BRIGHT PINK. Zoe's heart stops.

Zoe stands.   Looks at herself in the mirror.   And then...ZOE (CONT'D)Holy fucking shit!30.INT. TAXI - NIGHTManhattan fades into the distance, as they drive over the
Brooklyn Bridge. Zoe cracks the window.STANAre you feeling okay?

Zoe nods.   Her face looks pale.STAN (CONT'D)Good, because this should really
            be a culinary adventure. This is
            an underground restaurant that
            moves from apartment to apartment,
            depending on the chef.

Zoe nods again. Hasn't heard a word he's said. She rolls
the window all the way down and hangs her head out.STAN (CONT'D)And some of the guys from the band
            will be there. So, we might get a

a bad dream.INT. UNDERGROUND RESTAURANT/SMALL APARTMENT - NIGHTStan walks down a long table filled with appetizers. He is
making a plate for each of them. Zoe trails behind, beads of
sweat on her forehead.STANAnd this looks like a mache salad
            with grapes and feta.

He takes some for each of them.STAN (CONT'D)And this, oh this must be white
            beans and lamb's tongue. You've

She hangs up again.INT. UNDERGROUND RESTAURANT/SMALL APARTMENT - NIGHTZoe hurries through the living room, a packed drugstore bag
hidden under her arm. Stan comes up behind her.STANWhere have you been?

Zoe jumps and accidentally drops the bag. The tests spill

she pukes again. Finally, she lifts her head.ZOEOhhhhhhhh.

She spies an unused pregnancy test on the floor.  One that
must have dropped. Maybe this will be the one with the
answer she's looking for. She sits back on the toilet,

eyes.ZOE (CONT'D)Please, God...

But she can't pee.   She tries and tries.35.ZOE (CONT'D)Water, water everywhere, but not a

Zoe sees a gas station and jams on the breaks.INT. GAS STATION MINI MART - DAYZoe pours a massive cup of coffee. One of those gas station
Big Gulp cups. Even the TRUCKER next to her chooses a
smaller cup. Then, a look crosses her face.ZOEAm I even allowed to drink coffee?

The trucker looks at her.    She looks at him.ZOE (CONT'D)Do you know anything about being
          pregnant?42.EXT. CAR - LATERZoe's car is now parked on the side of a highway in the
middle of nowhere.INT. CAR - SAMEZoe is sound asleep with her head back and her mouth open. A
small, empty coffee cup in her hand, crumpled candy bar
wrappers on the floor, and an almost empty bag of Cheetos is
in her lap.

Her cell phone RINGS. Zoe doesn't move. After the third
ring, she lifts her head and looks around. It takes her a
few moments to realize what's happened. She looks at the
little coffee cup.ZOEThanks a lot, decaf.

She picks up the phone.STAN (O.S.)Where are you?

Zoe looks around.ZOEI have no idea.EXT. LITTLE GOAT FARM - DAYZoe bumps along the winding driveway of this idyllic Hudson
River farm. There are red barns in the distance and green
pastures filled with goats and sheep. The house is an old
carriage house with a rusty weather-vane on top.

Zoe parks the car and takes in the whole scene. Stan opens
the front door, with a huge smile on his face. Zoe sighs.ZOEHe's so not a douchebag.INT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATERThey enter the front door.    Zoe takes in the charming
carriage house.ZOEI can't believe you live here.
          This is ridiculous.43.STANI just come on weekends. My
          parents really live here.ZOEOh.   Where are they now?STANIn the kitchen.

Zoe stops short.ZOEWait, they're here? Now? Is this
          a "meet the parents" kind of thing?
          I wasn't prepared for this.STANNo. Not at all.    I mean, you'll
          meet them, but--ZOEWhen you said come up for the
          weekend, I assumed it was just us.
              (then)
          I think I need to lay down.INT. STAN'S BEDROM - MOMENTS LATERZoe lies in the small bed with the covers pulled up to her
chin. Stan stands above her with an odd look on his face.STANAre you hung-over or something?ZOEI'm just...not myself. Give me ten
          minutes. A ten-minute power nap
          and I'm good. I need to regroup.STANAre you sure you're okay?
              (then)
          Zoe? Hello?

But she's already out.   Stan gives her a little poke.INT. KITCHEN - DAYStan enters the kitchen. His parents, JOAN and EDWARD look
up expectantly, as if about to meet their new daughter-in-
law.44.EDWARDOh.   It's just you.STANShe's taking a nap.JOANA nap?   Now? She just got here.STANMom, I need you to not be
          judgemental, okay. I like this
          girl a lot.JOANHow can I be judgemental?    We
          haven't even met her yet.

We hear a SQUEAK, SQUEAK, SQUEAK coming down the hall.JOAN (CONT'D)What the heck is that?

The SQUEAKING continues and then all eyes turn as Nuts rolls
into the kitchen and stops. He tilts his head.STANOh.   This is Nuts.

Joan and Edward take in the raggedy/wheelchair-bound dog and
then look at Stan. Stan shoots his mom a look.JOANWho's judging?!INT. STAN'S BEDROOM - LATERIt's now dark. Zoe is asleep in the exact same position.
Suddenly, we hear a loud GRUMBLE. Her eyes open.ZOEWhat was that?

We hear the GRUMBLE again.    It's her stomach.   She puts her
hands over it.ZOE (CONT'D)Whoa.

Zoe gets out of bed and goes right for the Cheetos. The bag
is empty. She smears her hand on the inside of the bag and
then licks the orange cheese from her fingers.45.INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATERZoe peeks out of the bedroom and looks both ways.ZOE(whispering)
          Stan?

No one in sight.   She waits a beat and then whispers louder.ZOE (CONT'D)Stan!INT. KITCHEN - NIGHTZoe peers her head into the empty kitchen.   Nuts is with her.ZOEStan?    Hello?

Zoe stands there unsure of what to do next. Then we hear her
stomach GROWL again. Her eyes turn to the stove. Something
smells out of this world. She tiptoes over and opens the
pot. It's beef stew.ZOE (CONT'D)Oh, my God.

She makes sure the coast is clear and then looks for a spoon.
She can't find one. She spies a loaf of white bread. Grabs
a piece, folds it and then scoops up a heaping bite of stew
and devours it.ZOE (CONT'D)(mouth full)
          Oh, my God.

She replaces the lid on the pot. And now she just stands
there. And stands there some more.ZOE (CONT'D)Oh, who am I kidding?

She quickly takes two slices of bread and goes back in. This
time, she uses one piece of bread as a ladle and then the
other to turn it into a sandwich. She takes a huge bite.ZOE (CONT'D)Oh.   My.    God.

Stew dribbles down her chin. She takes a third piece of
bread to wipe her face and then takes a bite of that one.46.Nuts starts to whine and beg. Zoe uses her bread-ladle to
toss some stew on the floor for him. It lands with plop.

And now Joan enters. Zoe and Nuts turn, their mouths
bursting. Joan doesn't quite know what to do. All she knows
is she's supposed to be open-minded.JOANWould you like a plate?

Zoe shakes her head no.     Wow.   This is embarrassing.JOAN (CONT'D)A napkin?

Zoe nods her head. Joan gives her one. Zoe holds it over
her mouth as she tries in vain to swallow this inhuman bite.JOAN (CONT'D)I'm Joan.

Zoe nods.   Still can't swallow the bite.JOAN (CONT'D)And you must be Zoe.

Zoe nods again. She tries to shake Joan's hand. It's the
best she can do. Unfortunately, her fingers are fluorescent
orange from the Cheetos powder. Joan pulls her hand back.INT. DINING ROOM - LATERThe dining room is warm and lovely. There's faded wallpaper
and an old stagecoach lamp serving as a chandelier. Despite
the inviting room, Zoe looks very uncomfortable.EDWARDThe stew is delicious, honey.STANYeah, Mom, it's awesome.EDWARD(to Zoe)
            Have you ever in your life had stew
            like this? Come on, be honest.

Zoe looks at Joan.      Joan smiles.    It will be their secret.ZOEUh...no.    Never.47.INT. LIVING ROOM - LATERThey are having coffee and dessert in the living room.
Things seem more comfortable now. Zoe actually looks like
she might be enjoying herself. Nuts sits beside her.JOANSo are all the animals in your pet
            store...differently abled?ZOEOh, you can say paralyzed. He
            doesn't mind.
                (then)
            No, our pets are all in great
            shape. Purebreads mostly, but not
            from puppy mills.JOANThose puppy mills are terrible.    I
            read about them in the paper.ZOEWell, that's actually how I ended
            up with Nuts. I bought him from
            this pet store near my house. Six
            months later, I had thousands of
            dollars in vet bills and had to put
            him in a wheelchair.EDWARDYou should have sued that place.ZOEI thought about it, but what was
            that really going to do? They were
            still going to sell inbred dogs.
            So...I took the money I made when I
            left Google and just bought the
            place figuring I would do better.STANYou worked for Google?

Zoe nods.STAN (CONT'D)How could I not know that?ZOEYou never asked.48.STANAnd you made a lot of money and
          then bought a pet store?

Stan puts his arm around her and gives her a squeeze.STAN (CONT'D)I love that.ZOEIt's been fun. Beats brand
          management, that's for sure.JOAN(to Edward)
          That sounds like us, honey.EDWARDIt's true.
              (to Zoe)
          When we bought this farm we just
          wanted to make cheese because we
          couldn't find anything we liked in
          the stores. And now, twenty years
          later, here we are...JOANSometimes in life you just have to
          take matters into your own hands.
          Make things happen your own way,
          you know?

Zoe forces a smile.   If only they knew.EXT. LITTLE GOAT FARM - NIGHTThe moon is full and fireflies dot the air as Zoe and Stan
walk the grounds of the farm.

Nuts trots/rolls ahead of them in a different wheelchair.
This one is more rugged, with mountain-bike-type wheels.STANI can't believe that Nuts has an
          off-road wheelchair.ZOEHe's got one for snow, too.      With
          little skis on the bottom.

Stan smiles and shakes his head.49.ZOE (CONT'D)What?STANYou're really something.ZOEAre you making fun of me?   Do you
          think I spoil him?STANNo, I really think you're amazing.
          I mean, that story you told
          tonight. You just quit your whole
          professional life because of this
          little dog? Started your own
          business, just like that?

Zoe shrugs.STAN (CONT'D)You're very...unique.ZOEWell, you're a dime a dozen. I
          can't tell you how many banjo
          playing, cheese makers I've been
          with.STANI keep waiting for the other shoe
          to drop. Like, how can you be so
          perfect? Why are you even still
          single? I can't believe no one's
          snatched you up by now.ZOEI drive them all away, I guess.STANYeah, right.

Stan takes her in his arms.STAN (CONT'D)Look, I know this is all going
          fast...the time we're spending
          together, meeting my parents and
          everything...but, I'm okay with
          that. I want it to go fast.ZOEIt is going fast.50.STANBut isn't that okay? Aren't we old
          enough to skip all the bullshit?
          What are we waiting for? I...want
          to be with you.

Zoe opens her mouth. She's got to tell him.    Before this
goes any further, she has to tell him.ZOEStan.STANCome on. There's something I want
          to show you.INT. CHEESE CAVE - NIGHTIt's floor to ceiling wooden shelves all filled with cheese.
Stan ceremoniously unwraps a wheel.ZOEWhat is it?STANIt's cheese.ZOEI can see that.STANIt's a new kind of goat's milk
          we're using. I've been developing
          the recipe, and now it needs to
          age. It'll be ready for market in
          several months.
              (then, excited)
          Want to know what it's called?ZOEOkay.STANZoe.ZOEYou named a piece of cheese after
          me?STANNot just one piece. The whole
          line. This will forever in history
          be known as the Zoe.(MORE)51.STAN (CONT'D)Unless, of course, it tastes like
          shit, and then we'll just scrap it.
              (with a wink)
          But that'll never happen.ZOEHow do you know?STANBecause it's going to be fantastic.
          Sweet and sassy and very complex.
          Why do you think I'm calling it
          Zoe?ZOENo one's ever named a piece of
          cheese after me before.

Zoe stares at the cheese for a long time.STANYou're kind of hard to read right
          now. You're either seriously
          flattered or totally repulsed.

Zoe smiles.STAN (CONT'D)What?ZOEI want to kiss you right now, but
          it really smells like cheese in
          here.EXT. DAIRY - MOMENTS LATERThe door to the dairy kicks open and Stan carries Zoe out.
Her legs are around his waist and they are making out like
crazy.INT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATERStan carries Zoe up the stairs. They are tripping and
kissing and now tearing at each other's clothes.INT. STAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHTStan throws Zoe on the bed and then peels off his shirt. His
body looks amazing in the shadowy moonlight. Zoe lies there,
looking at him before he jumps on top of her.52.ZOE(under her breath)
          You're such a douchebag.STANWhat?

Zoe shakes her head and then melts into him.DISSOLVE TO:INT. STAN'S ROOM - LATERThey are now on their backs staring at the ceiling.    They
look happy and worn out

Their P.O.V. Those little glow-in-the-dark star stickers are
all over the ceiling. There's barely any glow left.

Stan lets out a big sigh as he looks at the "stars"...STANThat was amazing. I mean, like,
          totally and exceptionally, over-the-
          top, amazing.

Zoe turns to him.   Takes a deep breath.ZOEStan.STANYeah.ZOEThere's something I really have to
          tell you.STANThere's something I have to tell
          you, too.

Now Stan turns to her.     They are face-to-face.STAN (CONT'D)Can I go first? `Cause if we're
          going to say the same thing, I want
          to say it first.ZOEWe're not going to say the same
          thing.53.STANWell, let me go, because this is
          really embarrassing, and I just
          have to say it.ZOEOkay.STANI've dated a lot of women. I mean,
          not tons, but a lot. And, the
          thing is, I've never...been in love
          before. I've never even told
          anyone I love them before. Because
          I just never felt it. But from the
          day we met, from the first time our
          backs accidentally touched in the
          subway, I feel this, this...
              (he shakes his head)
          Maybe this is too much to say right
          now, but...I love you, Zoe. I
          really do.

Stan finishes.    He looks at her and smiles.   Zoe just stares
at him.STAN (CONT'D)In my mind, you were supposed to
          say, I love you, too.

Instead, Zoe covers her mouth and runs to the bathroom.     A
beat later, we hear her vomit.INT. STAN'S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATERZoe is at the sink, furiously brushing her teeth.    Stan
enters.STANZoe?

He looks at her.   Sees the tears in her eyes.STAN (CONT'D)Why are you crying? Everything's
          perfect.ZOEIt's not.STANSure it is.54.Zoe takes a deep breath.STAN (CONT'D)What?ZOEI'm pregnant.STANUh, I'm pretty sure it doesn't
            happen that fast.

Zoe shakes her head.ZOEI just found out.STANPregnant? As in you're going to
            have a baby?

Zoe nods.STAN (CONT'D)I don't understand.ZOEI know.   It's hard to explain.STANWell, who's it?ZOEI don't know.STANWhat?ZOEI don't know who the father is. I
            kind of know him. I just don't
            know his name exactly. It was sort
            of anonymous.STANAnonymous?ZOEHe's a donor. From a sperm bank.STANSeriously, what the fuck are you
            talking about? Sperm bank? What?55.ZOEI know, this is so fucked up.STANWhen did all of this happen?ZOEThe day we met. That same day.
          And I didn't tell you because I
          didn't think there was any way I
          could be pregnant.STANBut...why?ZOEBecause supposedly with frozen
          sperm it takes a few tries and...STANNo, why would you do this?ZOEBecause I wanted a baby. And I'm
          almost forty, and I never met the
          right guy. I was afraid if I
          waited any longer it would all pass
          me by, and I'd miss my chance.

Stan just looks at her.       Speechless.ZOE (CONT'D)I didn't know you. I would have
          never done it if--STANI just told you I loved you.ZOEWell....do you not now?STANYou're pregnant.ZOEDon't say it like that.STANYou're pregnant.ZOEYes.   I'm pregnant.      I'm pregnant!56.STANI tell you I'm in love with you and

          fuck am I supposed to say?! This
          is great fucking news?
          Congratulations?! Why did you wait
          so long to tell me?ZOEBecause I'm freaking out, okay! I
          didn't know what to do. I made
          this big decision to do this and
          then I met you--STANWell, what am I supposed to do now?
          This isn't how it was supposed to
          be. This isn't what--ZOEI'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay? Life

          and tidy like your perfect family

Zoe's face changes.     She starts to get it.CAROL (CONT'D)So, as you can see, we are really
            dedicated and choosing to be single
            mothers, and you seem to be in a

          I'm sure he loves you, too. But,
          you have put him in a really
          awkward position. Having a baby is
          a big adjustment for any couple.
          And you're not married. And he's
          not the father. And you've only

            lot of people talk about doing
            things, but you actually do them.
            You're really kind of daring. How
            you quit your job and took over a
            pet store all because some asshole
            sold you a lame dog. You came and

          having twins.

Stan looks at her. Is she joking? Her look says no. He
takes a beat. And then, even though it's not a joke, he
starts to laugh. A little laugh at first and then a big one.

And then, Zoe starts laughing too.   The whole thing is just
so ridiculous.STANThis is insane.INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHTIt's late. Zoe and Stan are naked in bed, lying face to

She picks up another picture. It's Zoe in a bathing cap and
Speedo. She's holding up a yellow ribbon and has her arm
around Nana.ZOE (CONT'D)This   is one of my favorites because
          look   how happy I am. I don't even
          know   what place yellow is, but I'm
          sure   it's not good.STANFifth place.ZOEBut I still look super happy,
          right? That's all because of Nana.
          Whatever I did, she thought it was
          the best.

The next picture is a Halloween shot of Bobby, Mona and Zoe.
Bobby is all in green, Zoe is all in yellow and Mona is in
regular clothes.ZOE (CONT'D)These are my best friends, Bobby
          and Mona. Mona and I met in high
          school and Bobby passed out on my
          couch in college and never left.
          You haven't met them yet because
          they might scare you away.STANWhy are you dressed like that?ZOEHalloween. We were supposed to be
          a traffic light but Mona bagged out
          at the last minute and so Bobby and
          I just look like idiots. That's
          typical Mona, by the way.82.Zoe puts the picture down and picks up another. It's a woman
in a hospital bed. She's giving the thumbs up sign.ZOE (CONT'D)This is my mom.

Stan takes the picture and studies it.STANYou look just like her.ZOEThis is the last picture of her
          that I have. She lived for a few
          more years, but we never took any
          pictures because she didn't want us
          to remember her like that. I was
          eight when she died.STANI...can't imagine.ZOEShe had a great laugh. And really
          soft hands. She used to rub my
          back before I went to sleep.

Zoe puts the picture on the bedside table, propping it up
next to her clock.STANDo you have any pictures of your
          dad?

Zoe doesn't say anything.STAN (CONT'D)I'm sorry. If you don't want to
          talk about it...ZOEMy mother was in a coma for two
          years before the end. That's when
          my dad left her.STANOh.ZOESo...that's when he died.    To us,
          anyway.STANGod, Zoe.    I'm so sorry.83.ZOE(after a beat)
          It's okay. It was an important
          lesson. That's when I realized
          that nothing lasts forever.

This sad statement hangs in the air for a few moments.ZOE (CONT'D)So, that's my story. That's the
          real me.STANThings can last forever, you know.ZOENot for me they can't.

Stan takes her hand, and they stay like that for a while.
Just holding hands on the floor of her moonlit room.
Finally, the silence is broken by the telephone RINGING.ZOE (CONT'D)That's weird.INT. LORI'S APARTMENT BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHTZoe and Stan enter the lobby of an old building in Tribeca.STANI'm confused. Why did you say you
          would come witness this birth in
          the first place?ZOEI don't know. Seemed like a good
          idea at the time. I was trying to
          get back in their good graces. Go
          home. I'll meet you there. I
          don't want them to see you anyway.STANIt's four in the morning. I'm not
          letting you walk home alone.ZOEFine. I'll just pop in, show my
          face and leave. Ten minutes, tops.84.INT. LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHTThere are candles everywhere and a table of food and drinks.
Kind of like a birthing cocktail party. Zoe eats a brownie.

Carol approaches with Lori, who is wearing a caftan and
rubbing her large stomach. They all hug.CAROLZoe, it's so nice of you to come,
            especially at this crazy hour.LORIYou're really one of us now.ZOEAre you sure you're in labor?
            You're so calm.LORIOh, I'm sure.ZOEWell, I just wanted to come and say
            a quick hi and good luck.LORIYou're not staying?CAROLYou have to stay. Lori wants us
            all to be together for this.ZOEWell, I really want to be here
            but...um, the truth is...actually
            I've been wanting to tell you guys
            for a while but, the truth is...

Lori drops her head on Zoe's shoulder and lets out a giant
MOAN. It's long and it's awkward.CAROL(whispering)
            She's having a contraction.

Zoe nods.   This is weird.   Lori breathes through it.LORIOkay.   What was it you were saying?ZOEI'm back with Stan.85.LORIStan who?CAROLThe farmer?ZOEActually, he makes cheese. He
          named a cheese after me. Isn't
          that romantic? Sort of?
              (off their blank stares)
          Well, anyway, I'm not technically a
          single mother by choice anymore.
          So, if you want me to leave right
          now, I totally understand. I'll
          just walk out the door and--LORINo, I really want you to stay.ZOE(bummed)
          Oh.CAROLListen, Zoe, if you're happy, we're
          happy. We'd love to meet him.

          I should probably get back to--LORIGreat.   Invite him up.ZOEOh, no, no, no...LORII'm not shy. I've been through
          this before. It's quite beautiful,
          really.

Zoe stands there trying to come up with another excuse.
After a few moments, it's clear that she cannot.INT. LORI'S APARTMENT BUILDING LOBBY - MOMENTS LATERStan looks up from the Hunan Lotus take-out menu he's been
reading to pass the time.86.STANExcuse me?ZOEJust a few minutes.STANI don't know, Zoe.ZOEYou have to come up. They begged
          me. And truthfully, I'm kind of
          scared of them. Please?INT. LORI'S APARTMENT - LATERZoe and Stan hover over the dessert table. They both eat
brownies and keep their eyes down. Sara is next to them
nursing Dakota.STANThis is weird.ZOEGood brownies, though. This one
          has peanut butter in it.

Carol walks by with a little DRUM, which she bangs
rhythmically.CAROLCome on everybody, it's time.
          She's getting into the water.STANThe what?CAROLOh, it's a water birth.   Didn't Zoe
          tell you?

Carol starts banging the drum again and moves off.STANWhat's a water birth?ZOEI don't know. But just so we're
          clear, this...
              (re. the whole scene)
          Is not the real me.87.STANI'll wait here.

Zoe grabs another brownie and exits.INT. LORI'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHTIn the middle of this very small, very cramped living room is
an inflatable baby pool. And in this baby pool is Lori, who
is now naked and pushing.

Zoe watches, horrified, the brownie still in her hand.    Carol
is beside her, playing the drum and chanting.CAROLHi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya.ZOE(eyes wide)
          Wow. Wow. Wow.CAROLI know. It's amazing how the body
          can open up like that.

Zoe covers her mouth. It looks like she is going to throw
up. She stumbles for the door.ZOEI'm just going to get some air.
          I'm feeling a little...LORIDon't move, Zoe, you're my focal
          point.

Lori then GRUNTS through another big contraction.MIDWIFEPush, Lori. Push.

While Lori's eyes are closed, Zoe tries to sneak out.    Carol
chases after, still beating the drum.CAROLYou can't leave.   You're her focal
          point.ZOECan't she use someone else?88.CAROLShe's in labor. You want to argue
          with her now?DISSOLVE TO:INT. LORI'S LIVING ROOM - LATERCarol beats the drum faster now. Some of the other Single
Mothers by Choicers join her in the chant.CAROLHi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya.

Lori lets out a SCREAM as Tabitha and the MIDWIFE pull her
legs back. Zoe watches with both hands over her mouth.ZOEOh, Jesus.
              (then)
          What is...that?CAROLSssshh. It's perfectly natural.

          Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya.

The midwife fishes out the poop with a plastic bag.   Zoe
turns away, gagging. She drops her brownie.LORI(yelling)
          Don't move, Zoe, I need you!
          You're my focal point.ZOEWhat does that even mean?

Zoe turns back.   Her face white as a sheet.   Lori lets out
another WAIL.LORII need to turn over.    Please!JESSIEDo it, Lori. We're here for you.
          We're all here for you.

Carol beats the drum faster as Lori gets on all fours. The
midwife lifts Lori's leg up to the side.   Lori lets out a
loud, WHALE-LIKE MOAN.89.CAROL(excited)
          Here comes the head.

Lori's moan turns into a DONKEY-LIKE BRAY.JESSIEWe can see the head, Lori.CAROLThere's so much hair!ZOE(woozy, afraid)
          I don't think that's the baby's
          hair.LORII want to see the head. Get me a

Through the hallway mirror, he can see what's going on in the
living room: a hefty woman on all fours in a dirty inflatable
swimming pool with a hairy head coming out of a hairy vag.CAROL (O.S.)Stan, get the mirror!INT. LORI'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATERStan, walks backwards with his head down, holding a mirror.STANExcuse me.     Hello. I'm Stan.

Carol grabs the mirror and holds it under Lori. Lori lifts
her leg like a dog taking a piss and then starts to cry.90.LORILook at all that wet, curly hair.

Stan steals a look, starts to dry heave and rushes to Zoe.STAN(freaking out)
          Let's get the hell out of here.ZOEI can't.   I'm her focal point.STANWhat does that mean?ZOEI don't know.

Suddenly, we hear a huge SCREAM.

Zoe and Stan turn just in time to see the baby emerge and
plop into the water.

CU of the baby in the dirty water still attached to the
umbilical cord.

CU of Zoe and Stan's horrified faces.

Zoe's eyes roll back and we:FADE TO BLACK.OVER BLACK we hear silence. Blessed silence. No drums. No
chants. No screams. Nothing. Until, we hear the SPLASH.INT. LORI'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATERWe are CLOSE on Zoe's face.    She opens her eyes.   Blinks a
few times.STANAre you okay?ZOEI don't know. Why am I wet?

WIDEN to reveal that Zoe is lying in the inflatable pool.
Her eyes go from side to side. The horror of the situation
becoming clear. A spongy, purple thing floats by.ZOE (CONT'D)What is that?91.STAN(afraid)

          those people, right?STANLike forty times.ZOEI feel the need to say it again.

They turn into the Farmer's Market.

Goat truck. Stan and Zoe slowly walk towards him.STANIt won't be like that for us.ZOEHow do you know?STANWell, for starters, you wax.

ANGLE ON Olivia crossing from her berry stand to the cheese
stand with a blueberry pie. She is about to place the pie on
Stan's table when she looks up and sees Stan and Zoe.OLIVIAOh, hi.92.STANHi.

And then Olivia notices Zoe's pregnant belly.OLIVIA (CONT'D)Wow.
                 (then, to Stan)
          Wow.

At the same time, Zoe notices the post-it on the pie.   It
says, SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.ZOEWhat is that supposed to mean?OLIVIAIt's nothing.

Olivia crumples the post-it and turns to Stan.OLIVIA (CONT'D)(re. Zoe's pregnant belly)
          I had no idea it was that serious.STANI told you it was serious.ZOE(interrupting)

Zoe's face changes.    She looks incredibly hurt.ZOEI used a donor because I wanted a
          baby.MONAI'm sorry.     I went too far.96.ZOEBecause I wanted to have a family.

The photo is Zoe at age four and a man who looks so much like
her, that it can only be her father.

After a long beat, she puts it on her bedside table, next to
the one of her mother. The two pictures, side-by-side make
up a family. Zoe and her father in one shot and her mother
from the hospital bed giving the thumbs up sign in the other.

          won't dance with you.ZOEWhat?

Bobby starts dancing. But really dancing. Justin Timberlake
style. Zoe smiles at the absurdity and then tries to walk
away. But Bobby won't let her escape. He blocks her path
and keeps dancing. This time turning around and shaking his
ass triple-time, like Beyonce.BOBBYHaaaaaay.ZOEGo away, you freak.

A crowd of old people gather round. They start clapping,
thinking this is some kind of young person's dance routine.BOBBYSmack it, Bitch.

Bobby takes Zoe's hand and smacks his ass with it.BOBBY (CONT'D)You know you love it. Uh-huh.
          That's right. Smack it.

The old people do the same. Trying to learn the hip new
dance the kids are doing. Several octogenarian couples
smacking each other's asses.

While this is happening, a weird look crosses Zoe's face.

Bobby jumps up and turns around to face Zoe. But when he
lands on the ground, his feet slide out from under him and he
hits the floor.BOBBY (CONT'D)What the hell?

An OLD MAN in the crowd looks down at the puddle.104.OLD MANDamn it. Not again.

All of a sudden, a white ROLLS ROYCE pulls up.   Mona's at the
wheel. She leans out and waves.MONAThis was my surprise for after the
          wedding, but let's hit it.BOBBYThis works.

          don't do vaginas.

They look at Arthur, who struggles to keep up with his
walker.ARTHURDon't look at me.

Nana starts to hyperventilate.NANAHelp me, Bobby.BOBBYNana, pull yourself together. This
          is the biggest moment of Zoe's

          bigger and better...who do you want

          choices are me or Mona.

Zoe starts to cry.BOBBY (CONT'D)I know. They're shitty choices.

          lesbian friends from your group?ZOEI don't know.BOBBYWe're going to get through this,
          okay? You just have to really
          think about it. Who do you want

And suddenly, she has to slow down and then stop completely
for a contraction. She leans against a parked van to steady
herself.ZOEOw.   Son of a bitch, that hurts.OLIVIAAre you okay?

Out of the corner of her eye, Zoe sees an enormous strawberry
on the side of the van. And then next to it, she sees
Olivia.OLIVIA (CONT'D)Are you in labor?

As soon as the contraction ends...ZOEFuck off.

Zoe takes off again.    Olivia watches her go.EXT. FARMER'S MARKET - LATERZoe runs through the market looking for Stan.

ANGLE ON Stan's truck, where Stan and Fred are unloading
cheese.ZOEStan!

Fred turns around and sees Zoe running. All belly and boobs
bouncing towards him. Her gown starting falling off.FREDWhoa. I've had nightmares that
          started like this.109.ZOEStan!

Stan turns.STANZoe?ZOEStan!STANAre you okay? Don't run!ZOEI can't help it!

Zoe bends over, holding her stomach.   A contraction.ZOEHee-hee, hoo-hoo, it was my cab,
          hee-hee, hoo-hoo.

The contraction ends. Zoe can finally smile again.      Stan
laughs and throws his arms around her.ZOE (CONT'D)Ow.   Ow.   Ow.STANI'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. I just
          love you. I love you so much.

Stan has tears in his eyes.STANLet's go have our babies.

Market. Even Olivia, watching from a distance, can't help
but applaud the big moment.INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAYSome fantastic song that makes us want to cry is playing...

They are both in tears. Even Dr. Harris can't help but cry.INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHTIt's night.   Zoe is asleep.

She opens her eyes and takes a moment to figure out where she
is. She turns to the side and finds Stan sleeping next to
her, curled up against her in the tiny hospital bed.

To the side of the bed are two bassinets.   Each baby sleeping
soundly in a little pink hat.

And in the next bed is Nana, asleep with a bandage on her
forehead.EXT. 6TH AVENUE - DAYNuts trots/rolls down the sidewalk wearing a sweater that

          than I do today, which doesn't even
          seem impossible...

of Louis Armstrong's voice fades in...

things that really will last forever.FADE TO BLACK.THE END
