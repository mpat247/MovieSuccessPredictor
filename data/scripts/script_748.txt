                                   Sean DurkinEXT. FARM - DAYIt is a hot summer day. A large run down farm house,
          several sheds, a red roof barn and a decrepid silo sit
          between fields of dry, uncut grass, in a serene isolated
          valley.
                         
          TWO MEN tack together a broken fence that encloses an
          overgrown paddock.

          FOUR WOMEN sit in a circle on a broken down, buckling
          front porch. One woman breast feeds a new born. The
          others knit a large blanket.
                         
          TWO WOMEN and TWO MEN swim naked in a swimming hole.

          MARTHA, sets a table for eight. Martha is beautiful but
          appears run down. She is 24 years old but her weathered

          One man sits at the head of the table, this is PATRICK.

          WATTS, a man in his early twenties with a greasy patchy
          beard.2.INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUSThe women are scattered around the kitchen waiting. The
          men finish dinner, pass through the kitchen and walk
          outside.
                         
          The women file into the dining room, clear the men's
          dishes, put more chairs around the table, and bring out a
          new serving of food.INT. FARM HOUSE DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATERThe women sit around the table eating very small portions

          TWO BABIES sleep next to each other in an old broken
          crib. A teenage girl sleeps on the floor next to the
          crib.
                         
          People are strewn all over the house sleeping. Suddenly,
          a figure passes quickly through frame.EXT. FARM HOUSE - CONTINUOUSMartha walks out the front door, across the porch, and up
          the driveway. She carries a small bag.
                         
          Her pace becomes increasingly faster. She looks back to
          see a teenage girl, SARAH, standing in the window
          watching.
                         
          Martha turns and walks faster, heading straight for the
          woods. As she gets to the edge of the trees she begins
          to run.SLOW ZOOM: MARTHA DISAPPEARS INTO THE THICK WOODS.Off screen, the house DOOR SLAMS SHUT. A MAN urgently
          yells out: "MARCY MAY"
                         
          The camera holds on the trees shaking gently in the wind.
          For a moment everything is quiet.3.Suddenly, A MAN and TWO WOMEN enter frame and run into
          the woods, chasing after Martha.EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUSThe woods are dark. Martha runs as fast as she can. She
          hears the MAN's voice calling her from a distance. A man
          and two women are chasing her.
                         
          Martha arrives at a steep heavily wooded hill. She keeps
          running at full speed, then slips, falls, and rolls.
                         
          Martha ducks behind a fallen tree and looks back to see
          the group arrive at the ridge to survey the woods and
          begin their descent.
                         
          Martha holds still, listening as the people chasing her
          pass by.EXT. DINER PARKING LOT - DAYMartha uses a pay phone at a diner. She dials and waits.
          She is struck by the voice that answers, she transforms
          from being a zombie to being flooded with emotion.LUCYHello. Hello?MARTHAHi!LUCYMartha?MARTHAYeah.LUCYOh my god! Where are you?MARTHAI'm not sure. Upstate I think.LUCYYou're in New York?MARTHAI think. Yeah.LUCYWhen did you get back?4.Martha doesn't know what to say, she bursts into tears.LUCY (CONT'D)Martha? What's wrong?

          Martha thinks for a moment.LUCY (CONT'D)Martha!INT. DINER - DAYMartha sits alone in a booth hunched over a grilled
          cheese sandwich and french fries. She devours the food
          like she hasn't eaten in days.5.The entrance bell rings. Martha turns around and
          cautiously peers over the booth. A FAMILY walks in. They
          are seated. Martha returns to eating.MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)Marcy May?
                         
          It is Watts. His voice paralyzes her.WATTSWhat are you doin'?
                         
          Martha stops eating. He slides into the booth and sits
          across from her.
                         
          Watts reaches over and takes some french fries. He eats
          them slowly, enjoying every bite. She can't look at him.WATTS (CONT'D)We were worried about you.MARTHAI'm fine.WATTSPatrick's worried about you.MARTHAI just wanted to come into town.WATTSI could've brought you.MARTHAI wanted to walk.WATTSThrough the woods?WAITRESS(TO WATTS)Can I get you something?WATTSNo.WAITRESS(TO MARTHA)You done?MARTHAYeah.6.The waitress goes to take Martha's plate. Watts puts his
          hand out to stop her.WATTS(TO MARTHA)You not gonna eat that?
                         
          Watts takes the half grilled cheese sandwich and stuffs
          it into his mouth. The waitress clears the plate.
                         
          Watts takes Martha's napkin and wipes the grease from his
          hands and mouth while he chews.WATTS (CONT'D)You ready to go?
                         
          Martha doesn't respond.WATTS (CONT'D)Come on!MARTHANot right now.WATTSNo?
                         
          The waitress drops the check on the table.
                         
          Watts stares at Martha for another moment before reaching
          into his pocket to pull out a mess of small papers. He
          sorts through them and separates a $20 bill. He stuffs
          the rest of the papers back into his pocket. He grabs her
          hand, places the money in her palm and grips it closed.WATTS (CONT'D)I'll get this.
                         
          He lets go. Her hand goes limp and the money falls on the
          table. She does not look at him. He leans in and forces
          eye contact with her.
                         
          Watts, growing increasingly tense, stands up and glances
          around the diner. It is very busy. He does not want to
          make a scene in front of all these people.
                         
          He leans down and kisses Martha on the cheek. She doesn't
          kiss back. He holds his forehead to her forehead until
          she reacts. She reluctantly kisses him on the lips.
                         
          Martha watches him walk outside. As soon as his back is
          turned, she gets up, runs through the diner, and suddenly
          cuts through the kitchen.7.EXT. BUS STOP - LATERMartha sits on the ground hiding between two benches at

          walks towards Lucy. Lucy rushes over and hugs Martha.INT. LUCY'S CAR - DAYMartha, wrapped in Lucy's sweater, leans her head against

           year and you haven't called me?MARTHAI'm sorry.

          The kitchen has large windows, through which a bright
          spot light, lights the porch but pitch black darkness is
          beyond that. Martha is scared to look outside. She forces
