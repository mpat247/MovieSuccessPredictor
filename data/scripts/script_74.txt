          An average American teenage boy begins to speak. His name isJOLIE.JOLIE(V.O.)All my life, my parents have told
                    me I'm smart and talented. That I
                    can be anything I wanna be when I
                    grow up. Getting into the West
                    Branch Magnet Program was supposed
                    to be some kinda honor. They probly
                    thought I'd grow up to be a doctor,
                    or a lawyer, or scientist that

          buildings.JOLIE(V.O.)The maple ave kids are coming up
                    from nothing. I mean, their only
                    shot at college is balling. And

          everyone at pretty much all of them.
                         
          And now Jolie is at the line. A classic american basketball

                    I've been fucking Henrietta for a
                    while. She's the best. She's
                    pregnant with someone else's baby
                    but I'm cool with that. In fact, I
                    think that's why I like her so
                    much. She's kinda thugged out.

                    like this than anything. I wish you
                    could be this way forever. We'd be
                    so happy like this.

                    kind of an outcast. I think that's

                    work for the same law firm. They

          face.JOLIE(VOICE OVER)I wasn't sure what to make of it
                    all. Why Henrietta's parents never
                    know she was pregant until too
                    late? Or why I never said something
                    myself? It was like none of it
                    really mattered, or was even real
                    at all, until it was too late.96.CLOSE ON: An old PC monitor. A picture slowly emerging from a
