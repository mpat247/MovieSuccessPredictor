CUBE--------------------------------------------------------------------At first we see an eye. Closed and slowly it opens up and looks
around. Later we get a full view of a man lying on the floor
in a strange-looking room. 4 walls, 1 ceiling, 1 floor. 6 sides
just like a cube. There is a kind of door on each side. Each
door has a handle. On the walls are weird-looking pictures.
They doesn't seem to look like anything seen before. The man
stands up in the middle of the room. The camera pans around him.
Then he makes some sounds and opens a door in one of the walls.
As he looks in to the open door, he sees a new room like the one
he is located in, but the light in the new room is blue. He
turns around and the door closes by itself. Then he opens the
door in in the floor. Under that door, there's a new room
excatly like the first, but in this room the light is red.
The door closes. He opens a new door in one of the walls.
The light in there is red. He looks back and then crawls into
the new room. As he lands on the floor in the new room it makes
a loud sound, and then the door closes behind him. He takes one
step, and then there is a loud sound. The man stands still.
Slowly he begins to bleed, and slowly his body begins to fall
apart. As the last parts of his body hits the floor, we see
a sort of trelliswork. First it moves to the floor, and
afterwards it is being folded up.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TITLE AND INTRO----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------A man lies on the floor. A door is open beside him. Slowly
we see a hand trying to find something to hold on to. A man
crawls up from the hole.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINHey...--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin closes the door in the floor. He sits down beside the
man lying on the floor and tries to wake him.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINHey...--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin stands up and opens a door in one of the walls. He
looks into a new room. Red light. He closes the door again.
The man from before is now awake. We hear a sound from one of
the other doors in the walls. Quentin stands beside the door
preparing to attack whatever that comes out from there. As
someone looks out, Quentin grabs her by the neck, throws her
to the floor and tries to beat her, until he realises that
it is a lady. The lady screams, and sits down in a corner
of the room.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINI'm sorry... It's alright, I'm not gonna hurt you.HOLLOWAYWhat do you want?QUENTINI thought you were...HOLLOWAYWhat?QUENTINI don't know...--------------------------------------------------------------------We hear a loud sound and everybody in the room looks around.
As the sound stops, someone screams for help. Quentin opens
a door real fast. As the camera switches to a new angle, we
see a girl in a red room screaming for help. When she sees
Quentin she walks towards him.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINSTOP!--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin crawls into the room.--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVENWhat, what?QUENTINIt's ok, come here.--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin helps Leaven into the room where the others are
located. Holloway helps Leaven out, but not good enough,
because Leaven falls and drops her glasses. Leaven sits up
against a wall and Quentin comes towards her.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINIt's ok, calm down, evrything's gonna be fine.HOLLOWAYWhat was in there?QUENTINJust give me a minute to figure things out.HOOLOWAYWhy are you afraid of that room?QUENTINJust give me a minute I said.--------------------------------------------------------------------The door in the ceiling is being opened. We see an old man.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINHow many people are in this thing? Listen! We can't go
climbing around in here.HOLLOWAYWhy not?QUENTINThere's traps.HOLLOWAYWhat do you mean, traps?QUENTINUbitraps. I looked into a room down there and something almost cut my 

head off!--------------------------------------------------------------------The old man crawls down to the others, while Quentin talks
about the traps. Leaven breathes heavily.--------------------------------------------------------------------HOLLOWAYHoly God, holy, holy God!--------------------------------------------------------------------The old man sits down and begins to untie his shoe. Leaven
suddenly hugs Quentin. Holloway sits down beneath Worth.--------------------------------------------------------------------HOLLOWAYAre you alright? Mister? Worth?--------------------------------------------------------------------Holloway gets the attention from Worth.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINAlright?WORTHI hit my head?HOLLOWAYLet me take a look at that. It's ok, I'm a doctor, it doesn't
look bad.--------------------------------------------------------------------The old man stands up.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINWhat the hell are you doing?--------------------------------------------------------------------The old man opens a door and now looks into a blue room.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINHey old man?--------------------------------------------------------------------The old man, Rennes, throws his boot into the room. An
incinerator quickly burns the boot. Rennes pulls the boot
back and then the door closes. Rennes drops the boot on the
floor.--------------------------------------------------------------------RENNESMotiondetectors integrated in the walls. Tough to spot.LEAVENOh God, oh God, oh God.--------------------------------------------------------------------Rennes is on his way to open a new door.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINWait a second! Let's all just relax for a minute. Does anybody remember 

how they got here?--------------------------------------------------------------------Long, nervebreaking silence.--------------------------------------------------------------------HOLLOWAYPerogies! I was eating dinner. Perogies, cheese and potato. I ran out of 

sour cream and then I went to the fridge and then I... I don't know...QUENTINYou... Leaven?LEAVENI... I just went to bed and thenQUENTINWhat about you?WORTHI just woke up here.HOLLOWAYMiddle of the night. It's like Chile. They always come in the
middle of the night.LEAVENWho?HOLLOWAYOnly the government can build something this ugly.QUENTINOh, it ain't government.HOLLOWAYThen what is it.QUENTINI don't know.HOLLOWAYAliens!QUENTINPlease, we're spooked anough as it is. Let's rule out aliens from now on 

and concentrate on what we know.LEAVENMy mom's gonna freak...QUENTINRennes...LEAVENJust won't be there...QUENTINWhat do you think Rennes?RENNESWe don't solve the act, sitting still. I'm moving at this straight line, 

till I get to the end.QUENTINAlright, I attend to agree.LEAVENShouldn't we wait here? To see if anybody comes.WORTHNo one is gonna come.QUENTINThere's a way in here, so there's gotta be a way out. We can avoid the 

traps using the boot. Holloway is it. What do you think? For an exit?HOLLOWAYOk.QUENTINIt can't be that simple.RENNESIt ain't gonna be that simple. Take a look around. Take a
good long look around, see it. Coz, I got a feeling it's
looking at us.LEAVENI just wanna wake up...--------------------------------------------------------------------Leaven blinks with her eyes several times. Quentin sits down
beneath her.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINLeaven, we can do this. We just have to stay calm, and work
together as a team. There's gotta be a lot of people
looking for us on the outside. I'm a cop, alright?LEAVENYou're a cop?QUENTINYeah... I'm gonna get you out of here, I promise, but you
gotta be with me on this one...--------------------------------------------------------------------Leaven nods.--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVENOk.--------------------------------------------------------------------Rennes opens a new door, waiting for Quentin to give "signal"--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINBoot it!--------------------------------------------------------------------Rennes throws the boot, nothing happens.--------------------------------------------------------------------RENNESClean.--------------------------------------------------------------------Through several times of boot-throwing we see other rooms, with
other colors on the walls. On the way to a new green room,
Leaven notice some numbers in the passage between two rooms. A
loud sound is to hear.--------------------------------------------------------------------HOLLOWAYThat one sounded closer.RENNESIt's mechanical. Seems to come at regular intervals.QUENTINMaybe it's the ventilationsystem?RENNESNo bets...HOLLOWAYNo kidding, I'm boiling--------------------------------------------------------------------Leaven looks at the numbers again: 566 472 737. Above these
numbers are some others: 476 804 539.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINWhat is it, serial numbers?HOLLOWAYRoom numbers, they're different in each room.WORTHOh great, so there's only 566 million 400.000 rooms in this thing.HOLLOWAYThere'd better not be! We have about three days without food and
water before we're too weak to move.LEAVENThey have to feed us, don't they?QUENTINHolloway!HOLLOWAYOh, we have heat, stress, physical exhaustion i.e. dehydration,
headaches, dizziness, disorientation, confusement. Mental process.
The body eventual begins to break down it's own tissue.--------------------------------------------------------------------Rennes rips a button of Holloway's shirt.--------------------------------------------------------------------RENNESSuck on it... Keeps the saliva flowing.--------------------------------------------------------------------Again the boot lands in a new room. This time, it's red.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINWhat?RENNESThe air seems dry in there.HOLLOWAYTrapped?RENNESMolecular chemical sensor.QUENTINWhy the hell didn't the boot set it off.RENNESThe boot's not alive. It detects hydrogen-sulfide extruded from
the skin.QUENTINHow come, you know so much about sensors, Renz?RENNESRennes... Not Renz! It's french!QUENTINFine, you're french. I'm asking how...--------------------------------------------------------------------Rennes opens a new door and throws the boot.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINRennes... Sensorexpert... With the right age... I don't believe
it...--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin laughs.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINThis guy is The Wren...HOLLOWAYThe what?QUENTINThe Wren. The bird of Attica. through the coop on six major
prisons.RENNESSeven!HOLLOWAYYou're kidding right?LEAVENYou can get us out?RENNESMaybe.HOLLOWAYAn escapeartist!RENNESYes, I'm Harry "fucking" Houdini. The only reason I dragged you
so far, is cause I need your boots. If you're not smarting up
I'm gone like that. No more talking... No more guessing. Don't
even think about something which is not right in front of ya.
That's the real challenge, you gotta save yourselves from
yourselves.--------------------------------------------------------------------Rennes jumps into the new room. We hear a click.--------------------------------------------------------------------RENNESMerde.--------------------------------------------------------------------Rennes gets acid in the face. He screams, and the door closes.
In the other room, the door begins to open.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINGet him out!--------------------------------------------------------------------Rennes' head is partly dissolved. He screams quietly, because
he has blood in his mouth. The others scream too. They lay him
in a corner. After a little while they look to him again.
He's dead, most of his head his been dissolved.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINSo it was electrochemical or whatever, right? And he missed it.
The Wren... That's great, that's fucking great.--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin turns the corpse of Rennes around with a foot.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINAlright... It's time to reassess this place.HOLLOWAYI've been over it again and again, why would they throw
innocent people in here? Are we being punished?LEAVENI've never done anything to deserve this!QUENTINForget about all that! You can't see the big picture from in
here. So don't try. Keep your head down. Keep it simple.
Just look, look at what's in front of you.WORTHThat's what he said.QUENTINStart with us. We got an escapeartist and a cop.
There's gotta be a reason for that. You're a doctor Holloway.
That gives you a function, a reason, right?HOLLOWAYNo, it just makes me go: "Why me, and not one
of the ten million other doctors out there"!QUENTINLeaven. What are you?LEAVENNothing, I jst go to school, hang out with my friends.QUENTINWhat else?LEAVENThere is nothing else. My parents are these people
I live with them... I'm boring.HOLLOWAYI think we have to ask the big questions: What does it want? What is it 

thinking?WORTHOne down, four to go.QUENTINWhy don't you tell us what your purpose is Worth!WORTHI've wondered that myself. I'm just a guy, I work in an
officebuilding, doing officebulding stuff. I wasn't
actually bursting joie de vivre before I got here. Life
just sucks in general.HOLLOWAYI can't stand that attitude.LEAVENBecause, he's right.QUENTINWhat�s your purpose Quentin?QUENTINKids.. Three of them... I haven't made my piece yet.
I'm getting out of here no matter what. That's where
my strength comes from. You people find yours wherever you
got it. For Christ's sake. What do you live for? Don't you
have a wife or a girlfriend or something?WORTHNope, I got a pretty nice collection of pornographyHOLLOWAYNice, nice. I ain't got anyone either, but I'm not giving
up. I'm pissed off. The came into our homes. They stripped
us bare. They took my rings. They took my... my amethyst.
I wanna know who's responsible.QUENTINLeaven, your glasses? You don't need them?LEAVENOnly for reading.QUENTINWell, they took off her jewelry, but they must have put
these on you. If nothing is random... why are they here.--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin opens a door in the wall. We see three numbers:
582 434 865. On the other side there's the numbers: 149 413 568.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINLeaven, what do you read in school? Math?HOLLOWAYWhat can they mean?--------------------------------------------------------------------Leaven takes the glasses and begins to study the numbers.--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVEN149?--------------------------------------------------------------------Leaven opens a new door. The numbers we see are: 645 372 xxx-649--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVENPrimenumbers. I can't believe I didn't see it before.QUENTINSee what?LEAVENIt seems like if any of these numbers of prime, then the room is
trapped. Ok, 645... 645, that's not prime. 372... no. 649...
Wait, 11 x 59, it's not prime either. So that room is safe.QUENTINWait, wait, wait. How can you make that decision based on one
primenumbertrap?LEAVENI'm not. The incinerator thing was prime: 083. The
molecularchemical thing had 137, the acidroom had 149.HOLLOWAYYou'd remembered all that in your head?LEAVENI have a facility for it.QUENTINLeaven, you beautiful brain... Boot it.--------------------------------------------------------------------Holloway throws the boot. Nothing happens.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINOk, out of the way.LEAVENBrains before beauty.--------------------------------------------------------------------Leaven jumps into the room............... Nothing happens......--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVENSAFE! Primenumbers! Primenumbers! Primenumbers! Primenumbers!--------------------------------------------------------------------The camera pans around for some time. First we see the numbers:
656 778 462, then we see Leaven thinking.--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVENHow long have we been in hereQUENTINNine or ten hours.--------------------------------------------------------------------We see a door closing. Then we see Leaven rubbing her eyes.--------------------------------------------------------------------HOLLOWAYHow do you know?QUENTIN5 'o clock stubble. the last thing I remember was shaving.LEAVENI guess I missed breakfeast... or lunch... or whateverQUENTINNow don't worry. I'll be home in time for dinner.LEAVENIf we get out, I'l make you dinner.QUENTINYou got a date.--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin opens a door and Leaven looks at the numbers inside.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINDoing good.HOLLOWAYI need to smoke! I could smoke a butt of a sidewalk.QUENTINHolloway... Just real yourself in a bit. Come on. Were moving
along, things are looking up.HOLLOWAYOk. You're right, I quitted smoking years ago. I just need to
be occupied.QUENTINTalk to me. Have a conversation. What kind of doctor are you
anyway?HOLLOWAYUh, you know, the free kinda... Er, come on help me. Tell me
about your rugrats.QUENTINOk. We have three boys. Nine, seven and five.HOLLOWAYOh, good God. Poor woman. There's no way I'd survived that.QUENTINShe didn't either................. She's not dead, we're just
separated.HOLLOWAYI'm sorry, I can't just shoot the breeze.LEAVENThese numbers aren't prime.QUENTINOk. Clear.HOLLOWAYExcuse me, sorry.QUENTINYou could try and help me out here buddy.WORTHNo, I couldn't--------------------------------------------------------------------The group crawls into the new room. Shortly afterwards they are
in a green room, with everyone looking down in a new room.--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVENThis one is trapped too.--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin closes the door.--------------------------------------------------------------------HOLLOWAYWe have to backtrack?--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin looks up.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINNot yet.LEAVENOh, no.--------------------------------------------------------------------Everyone looks up on the door. the Quentin looks at Leaven.--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVENRead them to me.--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin takes of his shirt. Leaven is ready to hold it.--------------------------------------------------------------------HOLLOWAYWhat are you? His coatrack? Oh please.--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin begins to crawls up to the door. As he wants to open
the door, he says:--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINIt's stuck!--------------------------------------------------------------------As Quentin opens the door, a guy falls down and almost hits
Leaven. Quentin jumps down and the new guy stands up.--------------------------------------------------------------------KAZANThis room is green.--------------------------------------------------------------------Kazan begins to knock his head into the wall.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINHolloway.--------------------------------------------------------------------Holloway now looks at Kazan.--------------------------------------------------------------------HOLLOWAYHi there.--------------------------------------------------------------------Holloway puts a hand on Kazan's forehead.--------------------------------------------------------------------KAZANThis room is green.HOLLOWAYYes it is.KAZANI wanna go back to the blue room.QUENTINIs it shock or what?HOLLOWAYI think he's mentally handicapped.KAZANI like the blue room.QUENTINJesus Christ!LEAVENHe almost broke my neck.HOLLOWAYHey there, are you all alone? Do you wanna hold my hand, honey?KAZANButter first, then honey, Kazan. Butter first then honey.LEAVENHow did he survive?KAZANI wanna go back to the blue room.HOLLOWAYThere's lots of blue rooms. We'll find another one to you
real soon.LEAVENThis is just way too bizarre.HOLLOWAYWill you just worry about your own numbers...--------------------------------------------------------------------Leaven looks molested.--------------------------------------------------------------------HOLLOWAYGo on, I'll look after him.--------------------------------------------------------------------Leaven points at the ceiling.--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVENSafe, obviously. Since he almost fell on my head.HOLLOWAYShall we go for a walk? Kazan, do you wanna go for a walk?--------------------------------------------------------------------As Quentin begins to crawl up to the door. Kazan gets
terrified. He hits himself with the one hand on his head.--------------------------------------------------------------------HOLLOWAYErm' Quentin. Let's not make him do the climbing thing right away.QUENTINHolloway!KAZANHolloway.--------------------------------------------------------------------The screen fades and next time we see something is in a new
room where Kazan opens a new door.--------------------------------------------------------------------HOLLOWAYCould they have taken us all the way to New Mexico?QUENTINWhat are you talking about Holloway?HOLLOWAYI'm talking about: "Where do you hide something this big?" It has at 

least got to fill something.--------------------------------------------------------------------Holloway stands walks over to Quentin and stands beside him.--------------------------------------------------------------------HOLLOWAYI'm sorry to shake your foundations Quentin, but you have no idea
where your tax-dollars go.QUENTINFree clinic doctors?HOLLOWAYOnly the military industrial complex can afford to build something
this size.QUENTINHolloway, what's the military industrial complex? Have you ever been 

there? I'm tellin' you, it's not that complex.HOLLOWAYAnd how would you know from where you are.QUENTINWhat do you think these establishments is? It's just guys like me. Their 

desks are bigger, but their jobs aren't. They don't conspide, they... buy boats. No, 

this place is... Remember Scaramanga? The bad guy in "The Man With The Golden Gun". 

It's some rich psyco's entertainment.HOLLOWAYIs that what you think?LEAVENClear!--------------------------------------------------------------------Holloway crawls into the passage.--------------------------------------------------------------------HOLLOWAYOk, you're a cop. Single bullet theory. Right on.--------------------------------------------------------------------As Holloway lands in the new room, she starts to lose her
breath. It seems like she's being choken.--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVENGas!QUENTINHolloway! Get back here.--------------------------------------------------------------------But Holloway stays where she is.--------------------------------------------------------------------HOLLOWAYIt's ok. I just swallowed my button.LEAVENI hate this! I hate this!QUENTINYour boy's having a conniption sitting there.--------------------------------------------------------------------A door is being opened.--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVENIt's like cr�me without coffee.WORTHShe needs a break.QUENTINShe can do it.--------------------------------------------------------------------Holloway crawls into Kazan and makes him touch her hair. And
then back to the other room.--------------------------------------------------------------------WORTHThey don't look prime to me.QUENTINIs that your two bits worth, Worth?WORTHOf course it's what is worth.QUENTINWell?LEAVENWell, he's right. Not prime.--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin jumps into the new room.--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVENSTOP! In front of you!!!--------------------------------------------------------------------A lot of wires or whatever is being shot down from the ceiling
and the slowly surrounds Quentin, rotates and Quentin
just jumps away before he gets split up into several pieces.
But it wasn't without pain. Quentin gets cut on one of his legs.--------------------------------------------------------------------HOLLOWAYWhat is it?--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin gets back into the room.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINSHUT UP!!!--------------------------------------------------------------------The door closes.--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVENI don't know what happened. it wasn't prime.HOLLOWAYQuentin, hold still!QUENTINSomebody stop that rackets!HOLLOWAYWorth.QUENTINLeave the boots.--------------------------------------------------------------------Worth joins Kazan to make him shut up.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINAnd shut the fucking door!--------------------------------------------------------------------The door closes.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINI had a feeling about that fucking guy. He knew about that trap.LEAVENBut these numbers aren't prime.QUENTINThen your numbersystem failed, but he knew.HOLLOWAYKnew what? How could he know?QUENTINYou're the paranoid, think about it. His only function so far is
to kick us when we're down.HOLLOWAYSo, he has a bad attitude. So you think that makes him spy.QUENTINTrust me on this, it's my job to read people like an x-ray.--------------------------------------------------------------------The door opens and Worth comes in with Kazan. Worth holds him
for his eyes.--------------------------------------------------------------------WORTHHe doesn't like red rooms.--------------------------------------------------------------------Worth makes Kazan, sit by himself.--------------------------------------------------------------------WORTHSo what happened?QUENTINPmfh, you saw what happened!HOLLOWAYQuentin!LEAVENI guess the numbers are more complicated than I thought.WORTHMaybe they mean nothing at all.LEAVENNo, it means they're more involved, the works for us up to now have just 

been bad, I just need more time with them.HOLLOWAYWe need to rest anyway.QUENTINWell that's handy, like if there was nothing fucking else we could do.--------------------------------------------------------------------The camera fades. Next time we see Leaven writing some numbers on a piece of metal.--------------------------------------------------------------------HOLLOWAYAre they telling you anything?LEAVENThey're not Tarot-cards. Do you have any idea on how many variables I 

have to consider before I can decide from numbers this size!?!? They don't reveal 

themselves right away!QUENTINThey're like people.--------------------------------------------------------------------Kazan pulls down his pants to pee.--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVENOh, gross.HOLLOWAYErm, not here honey, over in the corner.--------------------------------------------------------------------Everybody looks at him.--------------------------------------------------------------------HOLLOWAYWell, he's just peeing!QUENTINJesus Christ!LEAVENExcellent! Now it totally reeks in here!--------------------------------------------------------------------Worth laughs.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINAnd you find this all pretty funny, don't you?--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin goes really close to Worth.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINWhat's your fucking problem Worth? Even Holloway's holding up better than 

you. Get over there and help her with him. That's your job, babysitter!WORTHJawohl, Kommandant!QUENTINSomebody has to taka responsibility around here.WORTHAnd that somebody has to be you.QUENTINNot all of us have a luxury of playing nihilists.WORTHNot all of us are conceded enough to play hero.QUENTINIt's the will to live, everybody's got it Worth, even you, especially you 

hiding behind that cynical front.WORTHThe will to live. That's the warm, coasy feeling deep inside. Thanks 

partner, I'm a new man.QUENTINArh, poor Worth: "Nobody loves me". If that's the chip on your shoulders, 

then why did you lug it all this way? Why didn't you just lie down and die!--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin opens the door to the trap from before.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINDo it. Show us you have some backbone and jump into the sushimachine. Be 

a man.--------------------------------------------------------------------Everybody's waiting for Worth to answer. Finally Worth stands up.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINThought so.WORTHFuck you Quentin. I don't wanna die, I'm just being realistic. Do you 

think they just builded this thing so we could just walk out of it?QUENTINDo you think they would lay clues, if there wasn't a way out.WORTHYou think we matter, we don'tQUENTINPut us out of your misery so we can get on and get out of here.WORTHOh, you're not getting out.QUENTINYes, we are!WORTHThere is no way outta here!!!--------------------------------------------------------------------Long and nervebreaking silence.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINGot ya.HOLLOWAYHow... Do you know?QUENTINAnswer the question Worth.HOLLOWAYOh, God!QUENTINWho are you?WORTHI am the poison. I designed the outer shell.HOLLOWAYWhat?WORTHThe shell, the sarcophagus.LEAVENYou builded this thing?WORTHNot this part, the exterior. I don't know anything about the numbers or 

anything else in here. I was contracted to draw plans for a hollow shell. A cube.LEAVENA cube! Why didn't you tell us?HOLLOWAYFor Gods sake, Worth. You knew what it was.WORTHNoQUENTINWorth! You're lying.WORTHNot first.HOLLOWAYWho's beyond it?WORTHI don't know.QUENTINWho hired you?WORTHI didn't ask. I never even left my office. I talked on the phone to some 

other guys like me. Specialists working on small details. Nobody knew what it was. 

Nobody cared.QUENTINBullshit! You knew from square one. Look at him, he's up to his eyeballs 

in this thing.HOLLOWAYNo Quentin. That's how they stay hidden. You keep everyone separated so 

the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. The brain never comes out in 

the open.QUENTINWhose brain?HOLLOWAYIt's all the same machine right. Pentagon. Multinational coorporations. 

The police! If you do one little job. You build a widget in Saskatoon. The next thing 

you know, it's two miles under the desert, the essential component of a deathmachine. 

I was right! All along my whole life I knew it. I told you Quentin. Nobody's ever 

call me paranoid again. We gotta get out of here and blow the lid of this thing.WORTHHolloway, you don't get it.HOLLOWAYThen tell me, please, I need to know.WORTHIt's maybe hard for you to understand, but there's no conspiracy. Nobody 

is in charge. It's a headless blunder operating under the illusion of a masterplan. 

Can you grasp that? Big brother is not watching you.QUENTINWhat kind of fucking explanation is that?WORTHIt's the best you�re gonna get. I looked and the only explanation I can 

come to is that there is nobody up there.QUENTINSomebody had to say yes to this thing.WORTHWhat thing? Only we know what it is.QUENTINWe have no idea, what it is.WORTHWe know more than anybody else. I mean somebody might have known 

sometime, before they got fired or voted out or sold it. But if this place ever had a 

purpose, then it got miscommunicated or lost in the shuffle. This is an accident, a 

forgotten propetual, public, worksproject. Do you think anybody wants to ask 

questions? All they want is a clear conscience and a fat paycheck. I mean, I lead on 

my desk for months. This was a great job!QUENTINWhy put people in it?WORTHBecause it's here. you have to use it or admit it's pointless.QUENTINBut it is pointless!WORTHQuentin... That's my point.HOLLOWAYWhat have we come to? It's so much worse than I thought.WORTHNot really, just more pathetic.QUENTINYou make me sick, Worth!WORTHI make me sick too. We�re both part of the system. I drew a box - you 

walk a beat. It's like you said Quentin is: Keep your head down, keep it simple, just 

look at what's in fron of you! I mean nobody wants to see the big picture. Life's too 

complicated. I mean, let's face it. The reason we're here is it's out of control.--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin turns around.--------------------------------------------------------------------HOLLOWAYIs that how we're ruining the world?LEAVENDaah! Have you been on glue all of your life. I felt guilty for ruining 

the world since I was like... seven. God! If you need someone to blame, throw a rock.WORTHNow I feel better.HOLLOWAYThat's why you stayed with us. To confess.WORTHStill looking for someone to bust, Quentin?--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin turns around again and begins to beat Worth.--------------------------------------------------------------------HOLLOWAYQuentin, Quentin, STOP IT!--------------------------------------------------------------------Leaven grabs Quentin's arm.--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVENWe need him.QUENTINWhat for?HOLLOWAYHave you gone absolutely mad? He's the only one who knows nything about 

the place.--------------------------------------------------------------------Worth falls to the ground. Quentin walks away.--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVENWorth...WORTHHi...LEAVENSo there's this outer shell.WORTHYeah.LEAVENAnd it's a cube, like this?WORTHI assume so.LEAVENAre there any doors?WORTHThere's one door.LEAVENWhere?WORTHWherever the doorguy put it. Six guesses and it's sealed from the 

outside.LEAVENWhat are the dimensions of the outer shell?WORTH434 feetsquare.--------------------------------------------------------------------Leaven starts to take steps inside the room until she gets to Kazan.--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVENMay I?HOLLOWAYCome on. Side over.LEAVEN14 by 14 by 14.WORTHThe inner cube cannot be flushed by the shell. There is a space.LEAVENOne cube?WORTHI don't know. It makes sense.LEAVENWell, the biggest the cube then can be is... 26 rooms heigh, 26 rooms 

across, so... 17.576 rooms.HOLLOWAY17.576 rooms? Oh, God that makes me queasy.LEAVENDescartes...--------------------------------------------------------------------Leaven opens a new door and puts on her glasses.--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVENLeaven, you are a genius!QUENTINWhat?--------------------------------------------------------------------We see three numbers: 517 478 565--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVENCartesian co-ordinates, of course, coded Cartesian co-ordinates. They are 

uses in geometry to plot points on a three-dimensional graph.QUENTINIn English. Slower.LEAVENBonjour, these numbers are markers, a grid-referance, like altitude and 

longitude on a map. The numbers tell us where we are inside the cube.QUENTINThen where are we?LEAVENIt works! Ok, all I have to do now is add the numbers together. The X 

co-ordinate is 19, Y is 26 rooms. So that places us... seven rooms from the edge.QUENTINAlright, let's go.WORTHJust out of curuiosity. I mean don't hit me again or anything. But what 

are you gonna do when you get there?QUENTINMaybe we can get the door open.WORTHWrong.HOLLOWAYWhat we need to do is figure out how we get around the traps.QUENTINI'm dealing with that Holloway. I'm looking for practical solutions here.HOLLOWAYWell, you haven't found any yet!QUENTINWe cut the risk with the numbers and the boot. Worth will go in first.HOLLOWAYNo he won't Quentin, we take turns!QUENTINRelax.--------------------------------------------------------------------The camera fades. The first we see is someone nervous playing with his/hers button.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINIs there room for two in there?--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin crawls in to Leaven.--------------------------------------------------------------------QIENTINWhat's the matter?LEAVENThese co-ordinates: 14, 27, 14.QUENTINWhat about them?LEAVENWell, they don't make sense. Assuming the cube is 26 rooms across, there 

can't be a co-ordinate larger than 26. If that was right, then we would be outside 

the cube.--------------------------------------------------------------------Leaven looks up, and looks around.--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVENNo, not outside the cube.QUENTINI guess that means we're not having dinner.--------------------------------------------------------------------The camera fades. First we see the group opening the door in the floor.--------------------------------------------------------------------KAZANTrap, trap, trap. TRAP!--------------------------------------------------------------------We see a blue room. Just after Kazan says trap the last time. A lot of spears come 

out from the walls until the room is filled with spears. In the end the spears go 

back again.--------------------------------------------------------------------KAZANTRAP!--------------------------------------------------------------------The spears come again, and goes away in the end.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTIN(Whispers) It's soundactivated. BOOOH!--------------------------------------------------------------------The spears come, and goes away. They close the door.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINLovely.LEAVENHow come the sound of the door-opening didn't set it off?QUENTINMust be reat to ignore it.HOLLOWAYSo that's it. The edge is surrounded by traps.LEAVENWell, I guess we have to backtrack and try somewhere else.QUENTINWho knows how many detours we'll have to take. I say we cross the bitch.HOLLOWAYRight.QUENTINHow many boots do we have left Holloway?--------------------------------------------------------------------They look at Kazan's feet. Just one boot left.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINGet it off him. We know how it works, we just have to be quiet.WORTHPretty fucking quiet.QUENTINI'm glad you're on sight Worth, because you're up.--------------------------------------------------------------------Kazan makes a sound.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINAnd he's not coming.HOLLOWAYOf course he is.QUENTINNo way!HOLLOWAYYou're not leaving him behind.QUENTINHe's unpredictable. When we get to the edge we can come back for him, but 

he will get somebody killed here. Am I right?HOLLOWAYShame on you. Will you look at yourselves. What have you turned into? 

They may have taken our lives away, but we're still human beings. That's all we've 

got left.LEAVENWe'll come back for him.HOLLOWAYThat's a lie and you know it.WORTHHe'll be quiet.--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin opens the door and puts Worth down there. He hangs in the ceiling by himself 

now with a boot in his mouth. He crawls down the wall. Meanwhile we hear something 

nearby. As it's no longer is to hear. Worth opens a door, nothing happens, and crawls 

in. Leaven is up next. Afterwards Holloway. Next is Kazan. As Leaven is in Worth and 

Holloway stands on the floor. Kazan crawls in the ceiling and afterwards he crawls 

the wrong way. Holloway goes to get him. Suddenly his pants are stuck in the handle 

on the floor. Holloway tries to unloose it. Next up is Quentin. Now all is in except 

Quentin. He is on his way. In the floor the door is opening. So Quentin hurries up 

and aren't safe as the handle stops turning. He waits to be speared. Nothing happens.--------------------------------------------------------------------KAZANHah!--------------------------------------------------------------------Now the spears come again, Quentin just makes it into the passage. Now we are in a 

red room. Quentin grabs Kazan and almost beats him.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINYou fucking fuck!HOLLOWAYThat's enough!QUENTINHe's a trap!HOLLOWAYLet him go right now!QUENTINLaw of the jungle Holloway. He's a danger in the pack!HOLLOWAYLet him go you nazi!--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin lets go of Kazan.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINWhat did you call me?HOLLOWAYQuentin! You let that innocent boy go.QUENTINYou listen to me woman. Every day I mop up after your bleeding heart. The 

only reason why you exist is because I keep you! I know your type. No kids, no man to 

fuck you. So you go around outraged sticking your nose up in other peoples assholes, 

sniffing their business! You missed your boat Holloway. You are all dry up inside 

there aren't you? That's your fucking problem.--------------------------------------------------------------------The others look shocked.--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVENHow dare you say that to her? You don't know her Quentin. None ouf us 

know eachother here.QUENTINOh, I do.LEAVENNo you don't!HOLLOWAYNo wonder your wife left you. All that bottled-up anger. And a thing for 

young girls.--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin slaps Holloway in the face. He looks insulted.--------------------------------------------------------------------HOLLOWAYGod help you Quentin. Did you smack your kids around too?LEAVENIs anybody besides me interested in what's on the other side of that 

door?QUENTINOpen it.WORTHDoor number six, not door number one, door number two.QUENTINOpen the fucking thing.HOLLOWAY("singing") Sunshine.--------------------------------------------------------------------Worth opens the door. Now we see something completely black. Only with a little light 

from rooms below and on the other sides. It's the edge, the shell.--------------------------------------------------------------------KAZANNighttime.WORTHMy old friend the shell.--------------------------------------------------------------------Worth crawls into the passage.--------------------------------------------------------------------WORTHIt's there. Morning!--------------------------------------------------------------------Now we hear a gigantic echo.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINHang on to me.--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin crawls in and Worth crawls into the room again.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINCan't see shit. Nothing to hang on to.--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin crawls back.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINWe have to try something. We gotta see if the door's over there. Someone 

has to swing over there and take a look. We make a rope of our clothes. Take it off. 

I'll tie it onto myself.LEAVENYeah, you're gonna go. You weigh like 500 pounds it'll snap in two 

seconds. I'm the lightest.QUENTINForget it.HOLLOWAYI'll go.QUENTINI'm going Holloway.HOLLOWAYShe's right Quentin, you're too heavy. I'm the lightest after Leaven. 

Anyways it's my turn.--------------------------------------------------------------------As Quentin ties the clothes, Holloway and Worth talks together.--------------------------------------------------------------------HOLLOWAYHow long did you know people we're put in here.WORTHA couple of months.HOLLOWAYThat's not long , if you consider your whole life.WORTHI am.HOLLOWAYYou opened my eyes Worth, that�s something.WORTHDavid.HOLLOWAYHelen.WORTHAnd such a Helen.--------------------------------------------------------------------Holloway begins to crawl outside the room. She's almost crying.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINThat's as far as you go.HOLLOWAYThere's nothing down here. Hold tight. I'll try swinging over there. 

Place yourself I'm gonna try again. Ok, one more time.WORTHHurry, you're getting heavy.--------------------------------------------------------------------Third time Holloway tries to swing over to the shell there's a big crash. The others 

now drops the grip of the rope. Quentin just reaches the end of the rope, as Holloway 

is falling. The others graps Quentins feet as he is almost out fo the room too.--------------------------------------------------------------------HOLLOWAYWhat the hell is going on?QUENTINGet up here now!--------------------------------------------------------------------Holloway crawls up. In the end Quentin can reach her arm. First Quentin smiles, 

Holloway smiles too. But then Quentin looks someway different. Holloway knows what is 

going to happen.--------------------------------------------------------------------WORTHQuentin...LEAVENDo you got her?WORTHWhat's going on?LEAVENIs she Ok?--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin drops Holloway and crawls back into the room.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINShe... slipped.KAZANHolloway.--------------------------------------------------------------------Leaven sits down i a corner. Quentin walks over to her.--------------------------------------------------------------------WORTHSssh! Come on Kazan. Kazan will you please stop doing that!QUENTINLeaven, you gotta be strong sweetheart.LEAVENDon't even talk to me.QUENTINWe gotta get down to the bottom. It'll be easier to get on to shell from 

there. It's a long fucking way with only one boot. But we gotta do it, before we get 

too weak. You gotta keep cracking the numbers Leaven.LEAVENI can't think anymore.QUENTINSure you can. It's your gift.LEAVENIt's not a gift, it's just a brain.WORTHLet her sleep for a while. We haven't slept for fucking hours.QUENTINOk, one hour.WORTHHow the fuck are you gonna know how long an hour is?QUENTINAn hour is as long as I say.--------------------------------------------------------------------The group go to sleep. In the background weird music is to hear. After a little 

while, we see someone taking the boot away from Worth. Then we see a hand holding 

Leaven for the mouth. Then Quentin is bending towards Leaven and afterwards we see 

him carry Leaven. The next we see is a door closing.--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVENWhat are you doing?QUENTINWe have to make it down to the bottom. There'll be quiet there and you 

can concentrate.LEAVENDo you just wanna leave them?QUENTINThey're traps! We are the key. I get us down there. You think us out. 

Believe in me. Try to see what I see, how my mind works. THRASH! When I look into 

someone's head like a fucking x-ray. I looked through the walls. I dreamed him at his 

desk, designing everything. He can't let you solve the puzzle. There is a purpose. We 

are the purpose. The cube is us.--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin begins to touch Leaven.--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVENQuentin...QUENTINWe fit like numbers. A man and a woman. Two halves of the equation. I 

take you down. The perfect key.--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin goes further and tries to touch her breasts.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINI'll slip you on the lock.--------------------------------------------------------------------Leaven runs away. Quentin stands up.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINLeaven... It's time to go down.--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin tries to catch her. Meanwhile a door is being opened. Worth comes jumping 

hitting Quentin to the floor. Kazan enters the room too. The door closes.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINGet away from her. Leaven, they're fucking spy's. Him, the retard. 

Holloway had outside information about my family. She went too far.LEAVENYou dropped her.WORTHJust go QuentinLEAVENGive us the boot, you pig!--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin turns around and suddenly hits Worth with the boot. Then he walks towards 

Leaven.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINYou don't want the boot.--------------------------------------------------------------------Then Quentin again hits Worth several times. Afterwards he opens the door in the 

floor.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINYou wanna come with us Worth? Down the hatch.--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin throws Worth down the hole in the floor. As Worth hits the floor, he starts 

laughing.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINWhat the fuck's with him?--------------------------------------------------------------------The others crawl down to Worth. He lies on the door, on the handle. As the camera 

switches angle, we see a corpse with the face down. Quentin turns the corpse with his 

foot. It's Rennes. Quentin drops the boot.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINHow does he...?WORTH(laughing) It's The Wren, the old Renster.QUENTINHow could...?WORTH(laughing) We've been going in circlesQUENTINThat can't be.--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin grabs Leaven and opens a door.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINWhere are we?LEAVENI don't know.QUENTINWhere are we???LEAVENYou figure it out! You haven't done anything. All you do is freak out!YOU MURDERER!--------------------------------------------------------------------Leaven starts crying. Worth stands up and laughs. Quentin sits down.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINYou were right Worth. There is no outta here.--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin starts crying. Kazan comes and touches his hair.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTIN(crying) Get away from me.--------------------------------------------------------------------Worth stands up.--------------------------------------------------------------------WORTHWasn't Rennes killed in that room?--------------------------------------------------------------------Worth opens the door to were Rennes was killed. There's nothing. All we see is black. 

It's the edge, the shell.--------------------------------------------------------------------WORTHHow come there's nothing out there.QUENTINYou see an edge.WORTHWe were not at the edge before. Where's the room that killed Rennes?QUENTINFuck off!--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin throws the boot after Worth, but the boot does not him it's being thrown out 

of the room.--------------------------------------------------------------------WORTHOh, that was good.QUENTINWhat difference does it make? We're dead anyways.WORTHHEY! Listen to what I'm saying! There was a room there before! We haven't 

been moving in circles, the rooms have!LEAVENOf course.QUENTINThe rooms?WORTHThat explains the thunder, the shaking. We've been shifting the whole 

time.LEAVENIt's the only logical explanation. I'm such an idiot.WORTHWhat are you on to Leaven.LEAVENGive me a minute. The numbers are markers point on a map, right?WORTHRight.LEAVENAnd how do you map a point that keeps moving?WORTHPermutations.--------------------------------------------------------------------Leaven nods.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINPermu... what?LEAVENPermutations. A list of all the co-ordinates the room passes through. 

Like a map that that tells you where the room starts, how many times it moves and 

where it moves to.QUENTINThe numbers tell you all that?LEAVENI don't know. I've only been looking at one point on the map, which is 

probably the startingposition. All I saw, was how the cube looked like before it 

started to move.QUENTINOk, so it's moving. How do we get out?LEAVEN27. I know where the exit is.QUENTINWhere?LEAVENStay away from me.WORTHBack off, Quentin!QUENTINI just wanna know, don't you wanna know?LEAVENYou remember that room we passed through before, the one with the 

co-ordinate larger than 26?WORTHWhat about it?LEAVENThat co-ordinate placed the room outside the cube.WORTHA bridge?LEAVENRight, but only in it's original position.QUENTINWhat are you talking about?LEAVENLook, the room starts off as a bridge, then it moves it's way through the 

maze, which is where we ran into it, but at some point it must return to it's 

original position.WORTHSo the bridge is just a bridge...LEAVEN... in a short period of time. This thing is like a giant 

combinationlock, when the rooms are in their startingposition ht elock is open. But 

when they move out of the linement the lock closes.WORTHWell the size of us... It must take days to complete a full cycle.QUENTINSo when does it open?--------------------------------------------------------------------Now we see Leaven doing some math again. Quentin crawls towards her.--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVENDon't! We find it's original co-ordinates by adding the numbers, the 

permutations is found by subtracting the numbers. It's it. The room moves to 0, 1 and 

-1 on the x-axis, 2, 5 and -7 on y, and 1, -1 and 0 on z.QUENTINAnd what does that mean.LEAVENYou suck in math? Ok, I need the roomnumbers around as a referencepoint.WORTH666... 897... 466...QUENTIN567... 898... ok?LEAVENYes!QUENTINAnd 545... Did you get that?WORTH656... 778... 462...LEAVENThat's enough. X is 17, y is 25 and z is 14. Which means this room makes 

two more moves before returning to it's original position.WORTHDo we have time?LEAVENMaybe...QUENTINThen let's go.WORTHCan you work out the traps in the system?QUENTINFuck the traps, let's get to the bridge.WORTHWell you threw out our last boot, you fucking idiot.LEAVENTechnically I can identify the traps.WORTHTechnically?LEAVENFirst I thought they were identified by primenumbers, but they're not. 

They're identified by a number that are the power of a prime.QUENTINOk, so?WORTHCan you calculate that?LEAVENThe numbers are huge.QUENTINBut you can, right? You can?LEAVENI have to calculate to numbers of factors in each set. Maybe if I had a 

computer...QUENTINYou don't need a computer.LEAVENYes, I do.QUENTINFigure it out!LEAVENYes, I do!QUENTINI'm not dying in a fucking ratmaze.LEAVENLook! No one in the whole world could do it mentally! Look at the number: 

567898545. There's no way I can factor that. I can't even start on 567. It's 

astronomical!KAZANTwo... Astronomical.WORTHWhat did you say?KAZANAstronomical.WORTHBefore that...KAZANFactors...LEAVENHow many factors Kazan? Of 567?KAZANTwo...QUENTINWhat are you fucking kidding?LEAVENHow many factors does 30 have?KAZANThree...LEAVENAnd seven?KAZANOne... Gumdrop.LEAVENI don't have any gumdrops.KAZANGumdrop!WORTHKazan, I'll give you a whole box of gumdrops for each answer.KAZANGumdrops come in bags.WORTHYou want 'em in bags, you got 'em in bags.KAZANI don't like the red ones.--------------------------------------------------------------------Worth opens a door and tells the numbers to Kazan.--------------------------------------------------------------------WORTH8-9-8.KAZANTwo...WORTH5-4-5.KAZANTwo...LEAVENHe's giving us the factors.KAZANAstronomical.QUENTINYou're telling me Tell-A-Son boy is a genius.LEAVENBy those numbers the room should be safe.QUENTINThere's only one way to find out.--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin takes Worth and throws him into the room.--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVENDon't!WORTHSafe.QUENTINKazan, my man!--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin tries to make Kazan give him the factors.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINWhat's the numbers boy? Right here! Look here! Make him do it.LEAVENKazan, we gonna do some numbers, ok? We like to do numbers, right?KAZANPrimenumbers.LEAVENThat's right. Can you tell me the factors of 656?KAZANTwo...LEAVEN779...KAZANTwo...LEAVEN462...KAZANThree...LEAVENClear.QUENTINMove. Come on let's go. You too Worth. Move your scuddy ass Worth, I'm 

not through with you yet. Leaven open up that door, and get Einstein working on the 

numbers.--------------------------------------------------------------------As Quentin has his head in the room, Worth closes the door and tries to choke 

Quentin.--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVENOh, Jesus!WORTHGo! Hurry!QUENTINLeaven.LEAVEN563... Come on Kazan... 563...QUENTINYou fuckheads, you're dead!KAZANTwo...LEAVENClear...--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin gets his head out, and Worth closes the door. Next we see the number 384.--------------------------------------------------------------------KAZANOne..LEAVENTrapped!--------------------------------------------------------------------Worth enters the room and closes the door.--------------------------------------------------------------------WORTHCheck the floor.LEAVENIs he dead?WORTHNot quite.QUENTINNot even close, Worth! When I'm finish I'll throw you in a fucking trap 

on the way out of here.--------------------------------------------------------------------On the other side of the door, we see Quentin opening the door.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINWhere is he? Come here! I said come here riiight..........--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin falls down in the room under the floor. We see Worth hanging down there. 

Afterwards Leaven and Kazan help Worth up from there.--------------------------------------------------------------------WORTHGot ya. That way.--------------------------------------------------------------------Now we see the number 805--------------------------------------------------------------------KAZANTwo...LEAVENClear.KAZANFour...LEAVENClear.--------------------------------------------------------------------The next door they open lead them to the edge again. This time there's much more 

light out there.--------------------------------------------------------------------WORTHOh.--------------------------------------------------------------------Leaven puts her head outside the room, and quickly takes it back. A room is passing 

by. When they open the door again, there's a room there.--------------------------------------------------------------------WORTHI guess that proves out theory. The numbers.--------------------------------------------------------------------We see two numbers: 206 911 xxx--------------------------------------------------------------------KAZANFour, two, three.LEAVENClear.--------------------------------------------------------------------They enter the new room, except Kazan, the room they just came from moves away.--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVEN/WORTHKAZAN!!!--------------------------------------------------------------------In the background we hear Kazan screaming.--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVENListen. He hasn't moved far.WORTHI'm gonna find him. What do you think?LEAVENYou don't have a lot of lives left.--------------------------------------------------------------------We see Kazan in a red room. He's terrified. Then we see Worth entering a blue room, 

then we see Leaven step on a piece of glass, the one from her glasses. Then we see 

Worth in the ceiling of the red room with Kazan.--------------------------------------------------------------------WORTHKazan?KAZANI didn't move.WORTHYeah, good. Erm, you have to climb up here, ok?KAZANI don't like that.--------------------------------------------------------------------Leaven opens a door and studies the numbers.--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVEN14... 26... 14... WORTH GET BACK HERE RIGHT NOW!!!WORTHFive bags of gumdrops?KAZAN27 bags total.WORTH27 bags, deal.LEAVENCome here Worth, this room's next move takes it to the bridge.WORTHWe're coming.LEAVENOver here. Move it. We don't have much time come on.--------------------------------------------------------------------Worth and Kazan crawls in to Leaven's room. Leaven closes the door. They just make 

it, before the room moves. As we see the group again, they lie down.--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVENWorth...WORTHEaoh, it' better be it.LEAVENIt should be.WORTHWhere?--------------------------------------------------------------------Leaven opens a door, there's nothing behind it. She closes it again.--------------------------------------------------------------------WORTHOoh, arh.LEAVENGive me a minute. Be patient. So guess what, this was the room we started 

in. I was right, we should never have moved in the first place.--------------------------------------------------------------------The room starts to shake, it's moving. As it stops, Leaven opens the door. We see a 

red room.--------------------------------------------------------------------WORTHThe bridge.KAZANRed...LEAVENKazan.KAZAN38079LEAVENClear!!!--------------------------------------------------------------------They enter the red room. Leaven closes the door. Kazan opens a new door. We see 

daylight. Worth sits down.--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVENWorth???WORTHGo ahead.LEAVENWhat are you doing. You can't quit now. It's not your fault!!!WORTHI have nothing to live for out there.LEAVENWas is out there.WORTHBoundless human stupidity.--------------------------------------------------------------------In the background we hear a door opening.--------------------------------------------------------------------LEAVENI can live with that.--------------------------------------------------------------------Leaven says some strange sounds, she rises. Behind her we see Quentin with a door 

handle. Quentin has stabbed Leaven in the back. He drops her to the floor. He's 

covered with blood. Kazan closes the door to the daily life.--------------------------------------------------------------------WORTHNooo!--------------------------------------------------------------------Worth hits Quentin quite hard. But just after Quentin does the same to Worth.--------------------------------------------------------------------WORTHKazan get out to the door!--------------------------------------------------------------------Quentin stabs Worth with the handle. Worth falls to the ground. Quentin tries to 

reach Kazan.--------------------------------------------------------------------QUENTINRed, Kazan.--------------------------------------------------------------------Kazan opens the door. Meanwhile the room starts to move. As Kazan is outside the 

room, Quentin grabs his t-shirt. As he is just halfway out he can't move anymore. 

Worth holds Quentins leg. Quentin gets split up in two parts. Afterwards we see the 

room move. There's blood on the inner cube. In the room again we see Worth crawl 

towards Leaven. Halfway he stops moving he dies. The last we see of the movie is 

Kazan looking at the inner cube, before he turns around and disappears into the 

bright, white light.--------------------------------------------------------------------
