                                               March 15, 2012INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - MORNINGWe open with QUICK DETAIL SHOTS of a young boy dressing:

- a brown shirt buttoned.
- badges pinned.
- belt tightened.
- neck kerchief tied.
- shoelaces tied and shoes polished.
- socks pulled up to knees.
- hair combed.
- eye-pencil applied above top lip...??
- Shoes clicked together at the heels, one foot stomps down hard
on the floor.

He is dressed. We PULL to a CLOSE-UP, coming face to face with
our HERO...

JOHANNES BETZLER, (JOJO), a cute 10 year-old Boy. He stares into
a full-length mirror. He has drawn a HITLER moustache on his
upper lip.JOJOJojo Betzler, ten and a half years
          old. Today you join the ranks of the
          Jungvolk. This is a great day, for
          you, for your family, and for all of
          Germany.

And as "BREATHLESS" by NICK CAVE kicks in, we PULL OUT to reveal
Jojo is dressed impeccably in a HITLER YOUTH uniform. He does a
little dance on the spot and then looks over to a wall covered
with pictures, posters and drawings of ADOLF HITLER.

Jojo tries to WINK at a prominent poster of the F�hrer however
he can't close one eye independently so it's more of a scrunched
up BLINK. He tries again, not happening. He turns back to the
mirror and does the NAZI SALUTE.JOJO (CONT'D)HEIL HITLER!!!SUPER: "VIENNA, 1944"EXT. STREET - DAYWith a confident stride Jojo walks down the street admiring
himself in store windows. He greets everyone he meets with the
Hitler salute.2.JOJOHeil Hitler, Herr Josef!
              (beat)
          Heil Hitler, Frau Kirsch!

He is joined by his best friend YORKI, 11 years old, geeky, fat
and clumsy. They embrace.YORKIJojo!JOJOYorki! Heil Hitler!YORKIHeil Hitler!

They continue walking with excited energy.JOJOLooking good Yorki.YORKIYou too, Jojo. Did you bring your
          books?JOJOOf course. Now Yorki we must make a
          big effort this weekend. It's rare for
          we Jungvolk to be allowed at a
          Hitlerjugend training weekend and I
          want to make a good impression. They
          may promote us to Hitler's Special
          Guard early. Only the best of the best
          get to do that.YORKIYes, you and I will be best of the
          best.JOJOThe best Nazi's the whole world has
          ever seen.

They look a bit awkward and nerdy as they continue down the
street. They scream another Heil Hitler at each other, scaring
the shit out of an elderly woman walking past.EXT. WOODS - HITLERJUGEND CAMP - DAYJojo and Yorki sit with other clean cut young children aged
between 10 and 13.3.CHILDREN(singing)
          I swear to devote all my energies and
          my strength to the saviour of our
          country, Adolf Hitler. I am willing
          and ready to give up my life for him,
          so help me God.

A group of older kids, true HITLER YOUTH, are gathered nearby. A
group of girls from the LEAGUE OF GERMAN GIRLS (BDM) march past
on their way to a separate training area. Jojo sneaks a quick
look at a pretty girl, GUDRUN (12). She returns a smile as
CAPTAIN KLENZENDORF, weathered, over looking after kids, steps
forward. He is accompanied by his camp, awkwardly enthusiastic
assistant, SUB-OFFICER FINKEL (20's). Captain Klenzendorf
addresses the young crowd.KLENZENDORFHeil Hitler!FINKELHeil Hitler!KLENZENDORFJungvolk, welcome to our Hitlerjugend
          training weekend in which we will make
          men and women of you all. My name is
          Captain Klenzendorf - you may call me
          Captain K.FINKELCaptain K! Woohoo!KLENZENDORF...and this is Sub-Officer Finkel. You
          may only call him Sub-Officer Finkel.
          Over the next two days you will get a
          taste of the Hitlerjugend experience
          so you know what you're in store for
          once you're old enough to join
          yourself. You boys have all been
          issued with your Deutsches Jungvolk
          Daggers. Please take them out.

Jojo and Yorki inspect and admire their nice new DEUTSCHES
JUNGVOLK (DJ) KNIVES. Throughout the crowd we hear various yelps
as kids accidentally cut themselves with the blades.KLENZENDORF (CONT'D)These are very special and expensive
          weapons, you should never be without
          them. And DO NOT try to stab each
          other.4.FINKELNo stabbing! Or you'll die. From blood
            loss.KLENZENDORFNow, this is your first step towards
            being men. Today you boys will be
            involved in such activities as
            marching, bayonet drills, grenade
            throwing, trench digging, map reading,
            gas defence, camouflage, making traps,
            ambush techniques, war games, firing
            guns and blowing stuff up.

Huge cheers from the group of boys. Jojo and Yorki smile at each
other, this is going to be awesome.KLENZENDORF (CONT'D)The girls will practice important
            womanly duties such as nursing wounds,
            making beds, and learning how to get
            pregnant.

Groans of disappointment from the girls.KLENZENDORF (CONT'D)Alright, let's get to it. Are youREADY?!CHILDRENYES! HEIL HITLER!!!The entire circle salutes, as do Jojo and Yorki. The BDM head
off towards a COMMUNITY HALL in a nearby field.

And "I DON'T WANNA GROW UP" by Tom Waits bursts to life, the
older boys start screaming at the smaller kids, rounding them
up, ordering them into groups and y'know, being teenage Nazi
assholes.FINKELMove, move, move! On your feet you
            little Hitlers!MONTAGE - HITLER YOUTH TRAINING CAMP...Various scenes of Jojo and Yorki training with the Hitlerjugend.

- KNIFE   THROWING. Jojo and Yorki stand around with a group of
about 8   boys throwing their DJ knives from 10 FEET into a tree.
None of   the knives stick, instead they fly off at dangerous
angles,   one deflecting and lodging itself in another kid'sTHIGH.5.- GUN RANGE. Jojo stands, trying with all his might to aim a
KARABINER 98K RIFLE at a target in the distance. He fires and,
jumping from the loudness of the shot, drops the rifle.

- Inside the Hall, a group of girls attempt to dress fake wounds
on each other while in the background Sub-officer Finkel shows
other girls a sanitized and tame version of childbirth with an
anatomically INCORRECT diagram of a BABY inside a girl's
stomach. It's smiling.FINKELThen a happy baby comes out. Yay!

- WAR GAME. The boys are separated into 2 groups, one side
wearing RED SASHES and the other GREEN. They chase each other
round a clearing, pushing each other over and taking prisoners
etc. Jojo and Yorki are taken prisoner instantly. An older boy
watches them and shakes his head disapprovingly.INT. WOODS - GROUP CIRCLE - DUSKJojo sits in a group of boys and girls. One by one, sometimes
overlapping the children call out.CHILDRENHorns. Serpent tongue. Fangs.
          Green blood. Claws.

Cut to their teacher, FRAULEIN RAHM, who proudly writes the
children's words, along with others, on a blackboard. Above them
is the heading: THE JEW. Finkel stands nearby, observing and
taking notes.FRAULEIN RAHMFantastisch! Excellent work children.
          You also forgot that the Jew is the
          offspring of Satan and sucks the blood
          of Christian children for their
          mitzvah.

Horrified gasps from the children. Finkel nods.FRAULEIN RAHM (CONT'D)By the time the inferior race catches
          up to where we are today, we'll be way
          up here.

Rahm sketches a mountain with chalk. She draws a peak too steep
to be stable. The top of the peak is all skinny and wobbly.6.FRAULEIN RAHM (CONT'D)It has been scientifically proven that
          we Aryans are 1000 times more advanced
          and civilised than any other race.

Gasps and applause from the children. Fraulein Rahm smiles.FRAULEIN RAHM (CONT'D)Now, get your things together, it's
          time to burn some books!CHILDRENYayyyy!!!

They gather together and move towards another area where a LARGE
BONFIRE burns. The children hold stacks of books. Jojo opens his
bag and pulls out a small pile.YORKIIs that it? Only 4 books?JOJOIt's all I could find on the list.
              (reading the authors)
          Kafka... Brecht... Hesse... Burn you
          losers.

He throws them into the fire, Yorki follows suit. The books land
among other burning authors, FREUD, LESSING, MANN, PROUST,HEMINGWAY, REMARQUE.SLOW MOTION as the children all dance round the bonfire,
throwing books into the inferno.EXT. WOODS - NIGHTJojo and Yorki lie awake in sleeping bags under the night sky
inspecting their new DJ KNIVES.JOJOImagine being in a battle, you've just
          run out of ammo, all you have is your
          DJ Knife. I would take down 20 of them
          before they got me. And I'd be
          laughing when they did.YORKII don't like that situation. I don't
          want to die at all.JOJOLive Faithfully, Fight Bravely, and
          Die Laughing... that's the motto.7.YORKII know but I wouldn't be laughing. I'd
          probably be screaming.JOJOThen I'm afraid you might not be cut
          out for Hitler's personal guard. It's
          really hard to get chosen y'know. You
          need to have perfect vision, perfect
          teeth and you're not allowed one ounce
          of fat.YORKI(prodding his chubbiness)
          Hey, Jews sound scary, huh?JOJOYeah, I didn't know they stole the
          white skins of Aryans so they could
          blend in. Savages!YORKIMe neither. Thankfully most got sent
          back to their caves so it's not likely
          that we'll see a real one.JOJOIf I did I'd kill it like that.

He snaps his fingers.YORKIBut how would you know if you saw one?
          They can look just like us.JOJOOh I'd know. I'd feel it's head for
          horns. And they smell like Brussel
          Sprouts.YORKIOh yeah, I forgot about the Brussel
          Sprouts bit.JOJOImagine catching one and giving it to
          Hitler. That'd be a sure-fire way to
          get into his personal guard.YORKIHe'd be so impressed.JOJOThen we would become best friends.8.YORKII thought I was your best friend.JOJOYou're my second best friend. First
          place is reserved for someone really
          special - like the F�hrer. He, and
          only he can have that spot, so unless
          you're Hitler hiding in a fat little
          boy's body I'd be happy with 2nd
          place.YORKII'm just a kid.JOJOCase closed.

Jojo rolls over and stares at the sky.JOJO (CONT'D)(whispering)
          Night papa, I hope you come home soon.
          Night Inga, I hope you're happy up
          there.

A rustling noise can be heard, Jojo turns his head to see Yorki
doing sit-ups, gasping for air and prodding his tubby belly.EXT. WOODS - TRAINING GROUND - MORNINGJojo sits with a bunch of other kids. Two team leaders,
CHRISTOPH and HANS, (17) smoke cigarettes and hold court.HANSWhen you stand before a Roast Beef-man
          and have to end his life, which of you
          will have the stomach for it?

Everyone raises their hands. Jojo too, although a little slow.HANS (CONT'D)There is no room in Hitler's army for
          scared little girls and those who lack
          strength. We want hardened warriors
          who are prepared to kill at will. Can
          you do that?CHRISTOPHJohannes? Can you kill?JOJOPff, of course. I love killing.9.A few murmurs and nervous "Me too"s from the other children.CHRISTOPHGood...

Christoph uncovers a small cage nearby - it is filled with
little rabbits. Christoph takes a bunny from the cage and
holding it by its ears, hands it to Jojo.CHRISTOPH (CONT'D)Kill it.JOJOHmm?CHRISTOPHWring its neck. Kill the rabbit.JOJOOh, I'm ok. I might do it later.CHRISTOPHNo later, NOW. Or are you scared?JOJONo, I'm not scared. I just... I'm
          allergic to fur and I don't want itchy
          hands for the rest of the weekend.HANSItchy hands? Kill the damn rabbit and
          be a soldier Jojo!JOJOI thought soldiers killed people, not
          bunnies.HANSYou must show you have an iron stomach
          to undertake the work of eradicating
          the parasite.

Hans hands it to shocked Jojo who takes the bunny.HANS (CONT'D)Place both hands around it's neck and
          then one hard, twist, sometimes two,
          he might scream but drop him and we'll
          use the boot to finish it off.

Jojo shaking, holds the bunny and looks at it directly in the
eye. He gulps. The boys start to chant.10.HITLERJUGENDKill, Kill, Kill, Kill.

Jojo looks over at Yorki who is frozen. He turns back to face
the woods away from the group. He leans down. The boys are like
baying excited wolves. They crouch in around Jojo as he leans
down. He DROPS the bunny but it doesn't run. Christoph takes the
rabbit and snaps its neck. Shocked gasps and a few squeaks of
horror from the other kids.CHRISTOPHCoward. Just like your father.JOJOHe's not a coward, he's in Italy.CHRISTOPHNo one has heard from him in 2 years.
          He's a deserting coward just like you.HANSYes, he's a deserter.JOJONo, he doesn't do that, he fights.CHRISTOPHYou're as scared as a rabbit.

He places a boot on Jojo's head and kicks him to the ground.
Hans places a boot on his neck.HANSScared little rabbit. Maybe we should
          snap your neck.KIDRabbit. Coward.ANOTHER KIDJojo rabbit.

The rest of the kids taunt Jojo. He stands and runs into the
woods, laughter following close behind.EXT. WOODS - DAYJojo sits alone on a log, sobbing to himself. He looks up to see
a little BUTTERFLY flitting around by his feet... and then a
voice comes from behind.VOICE (O.S.)Poor Jojo, what is wrong?11.Jojo turns around, it is none other than his fantasy friend,
ADOLF HITLER. Jojo brightens at the sight of his hero.JOJOHi Adolf.

Adolf takes a seat. This is not the Adolf we know and hate, this
guy is goofy, charming, and glides through life with a child-
like naivety; a real dork.ADOLFWhy so down in the dumps little man? A
          strong boy like yourself shouldn't be
          sad, you should be happy like a cloud!
          Clouds don't care about anything!JOJOThe other kids called me a coward. And
          my papa, they say he makes desserts
          instead of fighting. But I know he's
          still fighting, for you, for me, and
          for Germany.ADOLFOh, of course he is! And he is also
          making nice desserts, nothing wrong
          with that. My God, his custard tarts
          are the only thing keeping up morale
          at the front.JOJODo you think he can come home soon?
          Just for a quick visit?ADOLFWell, I kinda need him for those
          special missions and whatnot. And the
          desserts are also an important factor.JOJOReally?ADOLFMm-hm. He's one of my top men. Now,
          want to tell me about the rabbit
          incident? What was that all about?JOJOThey wanted me to kill it. I'm sorry.ADOLFMeh, don't worry about it. I couldn't
          care less. I'm a cloud.12.JOJOBut now they call me a scared rabbit.ADOLFWell you want to know something?
              (off Jojo's nod)
          Just because they're small and
          delightfully cute doesn't mean rabbits
          are cowards. The rabbit faces a
          dangerous world everyday, hunting
          carrots for his family... for his
          country. Forget those boys. They have
          their place and so do you. My empire
          will be made up of all animals,
          eagles, lions, elephants and even
          rabbits.

Hitler lights a cigarette, offers Jojo a drag.JOJONo thanks, I don't sm--ADOLFBut not those Egyptian horses with
          bumpy-backs. I don't trust them.JOJOYou mean camels?ADOLF(laughing, condescending)
          Errm, I don't think they're called
          that.
              (beat)
          Remember this good advice Jojo, be the
          rabbit. The bunny can outwit all his
          enemies!

He winks at Jojo who tries to wink back but still can only
manage a weird double wink-blink. Adolf kicks a defenceless
stick.ADOLF (CONT'D)"Camels", ha!
              (aside)
          What's in those bumps I wonder? Gold?
          More humps? Baby Camels? I guess we'll
          never know their secrets!JOJO(to himself)
          Be the Rabbit...13.EXT. WOODS - TRAINING GROUND - DAYThe older boys are getting instructions from Captain Klenzendorf
on throwing hand-grenades. They stand around within a sort of
trench set-up. The young kids sit back, behind the trench at a
safe distance. Finkel stands nervously to the side, sort of
hiding behind Klenzendorf.KLENZENDORFNow lads, the hand-grenade is one of
          the most effective weapons in the
          German army. It can blow off a leg,
          maybe 2 legs, definitely a head. It is
          very dangerous. Just quietly, I prefer
          the rounder, egg-shaped version used
          by the British and Americans. I dunno,
          it just seems silly that our ones look
          like sticks.FINKELSticks... pff.

He continues talking in the background as Jojo approaches the
young kids and sidles up next to Yorki.YORKIAre you alright Jojo?JOJOAbsolutely, I was just doing some push-
          ups for my muscles.YORKII thought you were crying.JOJONope. Push-ups.
              (flexing his tiny arm )
          And don't just assume that because
          water comes from someone's eyes that
          they are crying, okay? Are you a tear-
          drop specialist?YORKINo.JOJOCase closed. Now, Yorki Dorky, it's
          time for Jojo to show these big pip-
          squeaks who is a coward. I mean, NOT a
          coward - me. You'll see what I mean.

He takes a deep breath and scurries off into the bushes.14.YORKI(loud whisper)
          Jojo! Where are you going? Don't you
          want to watch the hand-grenades?

We are back with the older group.KLENZENDORFNow you little kids stay all the way
          over there and watch the action.
              (to the older kids)
          Each of you will be given the
          opportunity to arm and throw a
          grenade. ONE AT A TIME. I will
          personally be supervising each--

Suddenly, in a flurry of noise and action, Jojo bursts out of
the bushes and onto the scene.JOJOJojo rabbit! Jojo rabbit! Hunting
          carrots, Jojo rabbit!

He runs past the boys, grabs one of the GRENADES from the open
box and darts out, over the top of the trench and into the HOT
ZONE - a wooded area stretching out before the group.KLENZENDORFYou! Get back here with that!!!

But Jojo is off, he   runs from the group. Adolf Hitler runs
beside him, goading   him on, screaming things like "Jojo Rabbit!"
They reach a little   clearing where Jojo pulls the PIN on the
grenade and screams   an ungodly war-cry.JOJOJOJO RABBIIIIIIIIT!!!He hurls the grenade like a war hero. It flies through the air,
bounces off a tree, hits another one, deflects off a nearby
branch and ricochets backwards, landing only 6-feet away from
Jojo.ADOLFScheisse.

He bolts, getting clear and leaving Jojo standing alone, the
grenade at his feet.JOJOOoh, scheisse...

KABOOM!!! Jojo goes flying in an explosion of smoke and debris.15.SFX: HEAVY BREATHING...FADE OUT.INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAYJOJO'S POV - The next couple of minutes are small glimpses as
Jojo comes in and out of consciousness.

- Bright lights in an operating room. A doctor hovers over us,
we see INSTRUMENTS. A concerned Adolf Hitler peeks in, smiles
and gives us the thumbs up. Jojo's BLOODIED THUMB comes into
view.

- Over BLACK, we hear voices. Fade up to see a concerned male
doctor and Captain Klenzendorf.KLENZENDORFIt was one of those stick-shaped ones,
          not the superior oval type. Do you
          know the ones I mean?

Finkel holds up one a stick grenade.FINKELLike this.KLENZENDORFExactly. Anyway, luckily it was only a
          training grenade, half packed with
          explosive. A proper one would have
          blown off his leg. Maybe both.FINKELProbably both. Or a head.KLENZENDORF(aside, to doctor)
          Do you think I could get in trouble
          for this?

- FADE UP as we hear the sound of Jojo's mother, FRAU BETZLER,
entering the room. She comes in to focus, a beautiful and kind
face.FRAU BETZLERDarling Jojo, my cub... I'm taking you
          home.

- The shot wells with tears, de-focuses, and fades.16.- Over black we hear sounds. We come in and out of a hazy
picture of Frau Betzler sitting beside Jojo, her hand caressing
his face. We are in his bedroom now, the Hitler posters still on
the wall. His mother comes in and out of focus. The image shifts
and we see various small, STUFFED ANIMALS, on the pillow next to
him - a LION, an ELEPHANT, a CAMEL, a RABBIT.WE FADE TO BLACK AND HEAR WHISPERS, PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE.INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - JOJO'S BEDROOM - NIGHTJojo wakes in a daze. Feeling something nearby, Jojo sits
absolutely silent. A creak is heard directly outside his open
door. He whispers.JOJOHello?

The creaking stops. Jojo cowers under the blankets.JOJO (CONT'D)(quietly)
          Inga, don't scare me. Please.FADE OUT.INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - MORNINGA NEW JOJO stands before us in front of the mirror. The right
side of his face is SCARRED. His RIGHT ARM hangs limply by his
side. He wears a simple shirt, he still has his hair and
although he is half the boy he used to be, with his injuries he
now looks older, kind of cooler.FRAU BETZLER (O.S.)There's my little cub.

In the mirror Jojo sees his mother standing at the door,
smiling.JOJOHeil Hitler, Mama!!!FRAU BETZLERWow, a little louder nest time huh?
          Didn't quite hear you. Hello darling.

She approaches and hugs him tightly, smiling.JOJOWhy so happy? Your son is a monster.17.FRAU BETZLERNo. Not a monster, you're still my
          beautiful Jojo. Besides the doctors
          are confident you will get most of the
          movement back in your hand and you

          others Jojo. You're fine as you are.JOJOI need to be better.FRAU BETZLERYou need to be you, not Mr. Uber

          proudest mother in the whole wide
          Reich.

She smiles sadly. Jojo tries to tie his bootlaces. He is having
trouble with only one good hand. Frau Betzler kneels down and
helps him.FRAU BETZLERA few more months and you'll get it.

          Now, you better get on your way, I
          told the Hitlerjugend office you were
          coming in today.JOJOI thought you didn't want me to be
          involved with all that.18.FRAU BETZLERI don't want you involved in being
          dead on some battlefield. You can't be
          a soldier but you can still help. I
          think getting out of the house will do
          wonders for your recuperation. Come
          on, you can walk me to the food store
          first. We need supplies.EXT. JOJO'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATERJojo's mother helps him put on his jacket and he catches another
glimpse of himself reflected in some glass.JOJOI don't want to go out there.FRAU BETZLERDon't be silly, of course you do.JOJOBut people will look at me.FRAU BETZLERLet them! Enjoy the attention, kid.

outside.FRAU BETZLERLooks like the coast is clear. Field
          Marshall Jojo, you're our top man,
          only you can accomplish this

Jojo smiles and prepares himself, playing along.JOJOIs it dangerous?

His mother WINKS at him and smiles wide.19.FRAU BETZLERExtremely.

She kisses him on the head and opens the door.EXT. TOWN - STREET / RATION STORE - DAYJojo and his mother walk down the street. As he LIMPS, Jojo
tries to avoid peoples' gazes. His mother enters a FOOD RATION
STORE leaving Jojo outside. He notices himself in the store
window and from his POV we see the new, crooked and damaged
version of the sprightly young boy at the beginning of our
story.

We PULL FOCUS to within the store. Frau Betzler takes a bag of
food and loads them into a shopping stroller. Other people in
the store watch her.I/E. REICHSJUGENDAMT OFFICE - DAYJojo and Frau Betzler part ways outside the Reichsjugendamt
(Hitler Youth office), a small but official looking structure.FRAU BETZLERYou have a wonderful day, cub.
              (then)
          Oh, you have something on your shirt.

She points and Jojo looks down. It's the old trick where she
brings her hand up to ding him in the face. He laughs.JOJODon't!FRAU BETZLERWhat? You really do have something!
          Look!

She does it again and once more he falls for it.JOJOStop it, Mama! Don't hit me!FRAU BETZLERI'm not hitting you, you're hitting
          yourself!

She grabs his wrists and makes Jojo lightly swat himself in the
face, again and again. He giggles, absolutely powerless.20.FRAU BETZLER (CONT'D)Heyyy kid, don't beat yourself up.
          You're a good guy, no need for all
          this violence!

She's a real clown and utterly charming. She wraps him up and
gives him FIVE HUGE SMOOCHES all over his face.FRAU BETZLER (CONT'D)I love you. Heil Shitler.

We reveal Jojo's face is covered in lipstick kiss-marks. She
heads off down the street, whistling.INT. REICHSJUGENDAMT - MOMENTS LATERJojo enters a large office. There is the usual Nazi Propaganda
on the walls and a large SWASTIKA FLAG hangs behind a SECRETARY
who sits at a desk looking incredibly bored. Two TEENAGE YOUTH
OFFICERS laze about while a couple of other children come and go
through the scene.JOJO(screaming)HEIL HITLER!!The secretary and Officers jump.SECRETARYJesus kid.OFFICERSHeil Hitler.SECRETARY(eyeing Jojo)

A figure emerges from an office - Captain Klenzendorf. Seeing
Jojo's injuries he winces a little but covers well. He is
followed by Sub-Officer Finkel who is buttoning up his jacket.KLENZENDORFHeyyyy Johannes! Looking good.JOJOHello Herr Klenzendorf.KLENZENDORFYou remember Unteroffiziere Finkel.

Finkel nods to Jojo and continues to look weird and out of
place.FINKELHeil Hitler, little boy.KLENZENDORF(to the others)
          Guys this is Johannes Betzler, the kid
          I told you about. Remember, he stole a
          hand grenade and blew himself up and
          as a result I was demoted for
          negligence and now have to work in
          this office.JOJOI am sorry you were demoted.KLENZENDORFOh it's fine. I wasn't really
          enthusiastic about that training camp
          stuff. Little Nazis running around,

          Your mother came in the other day and
          explained your situation.JOJOWhat did she say?KLENZENDORFOnly that it's just the two of you at
          home now, and that you wanted to help
          out here. Your father is a soldier,
          no?22.JOJOYes, he is fighting with the 10th Army
          in Italy. And he makes desserts.KLENZENDORFAnd you had a sister.JOJOInga. She died of influenza.KLENZENDORFI'm sorry to hear that. Well, it would
          seem you are the man of the house so

A beat - not sure what to do next, everyone stares at Jojo.KLENZENDORF (CONT'D)Ideas guys?OFFICER 1Umm, well, I guess you could hand out
          some of this information.

He indicates a large pile of pamphlets in the corner.OFFICER 2And deliver these conscriptions.JOJOConscripts. I don't suppose I could
          have one of those could I? I'm
          actually in peak physical condition.KLENZENDORFMaybe later, Jojo, you're still on the
          mend. For now you can start small.
          Conscripts and propaganda.JOJOYour wish is my command. I will
          execute my orders with precision and

          between information and propaganda?

Beat.FINKELJust deliver the stuff , kid.JOJOJa wohl!

He turns on his heels and is OUT.23.EXT. TOWN - STREET - DAYJojo pins up some posters of HITLER in a stoic pose, looking off
into the distance. Below him is the propaganda slogan:ONE PEOPLE, ONE EMPIRE, ONE LEADERJojo smiles at this image of the mighty F�hrer. He gives a happy
"Heil Hitler" to people who pass by, but we get the feeling the
public are losing enthusiasm in their salutes.JOJOHeil Hitler, Frau Baumer!FRAU BAUMERHmm? Oh yes, Sieg Heil.JOJOHeil Hitler, Herr Koch.HERR KOCHHmm?
              (seeing Jojo's injuries)
          Oooh, yikes.EXT. TOWN SQUARE - FLORIDSDORFER SPITZ - DAYJojo jauntily walks through a large town square where he sees a
number of locals grouped near some trees. He gets closer and
sees they are gathered before a make-shift GALLOWS. About FIVE
BODIES, men and women hang from the GALLOWS while onlookers
stare or take photos.

There are signs around their necks but we don't see what is
written on them. Jojo moves on, taking occasional glimpses back.I/E. GRUSCH GROCERY - DAYHe reaches a small GROCERY STORE. He enters and approaches the
quiet and sad-eyed Herr Grusch.JOJOHeil Hitler, Herr Grusch.HERR GRUSCH(seeing Jojo's injuries)
          What happened to you?JOJOWar wound. I'll probably get a medal.

Herr Grusch sighs.HERR GRUSCHYes, it is, but he already joined.JOJOWhere is he?

The old man points upwards.JOJO (CONT'D)Oh, I'm sorry. The F�hrer would be
          proud.HERR GRUSCHThat's comforting.
              (Taking the letter)
          Klaus is also my name.JOJOBut you're...HERR GRUSCHThey're recruiting us veterans of the
          Great War now. There are no more young
          people left. This whole thing is
          becoming very flimsy. I don't know how
          to operate a flame-thrower or anti-
          tank gun. So stupid.

He throws his conscription down.JOJO(turning)
          You are more able than I Herr Grusch.
          Everyone must do their part and that
          includes you. I hope I do not need to

Jojo turns on his heels and leaves.25.INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - DINING ROOMJojo arrives home.JOJOMama! I'm home.

He drops his satchel and heads for the kitchen.JOJO (O.S.) (CONT'D)Maaaama, Field Marshall Jojo is home.

He returns.JOJO (CONT'D)Mama Lion?

We hear a noise from upstairs. A small THUD. Jojo looks up.INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - INGA'S BEDROOM - LATERJojo slowly makes his way down the upstairs hall, looking in
rooms. He moves towards his sister's room. He takes a moment
before stepping into the room and wandering around. He looks at
a photo of INGA, she is beautiful. He smiles and puts it down,
and then...BANG!The door slams shut. Jojo stands. He turns to see the window is
open, the drapes blowing. He breathes a small sigh of relief,
sits on the bed. He examines an array of Inga's things on the
dresser in front of him, RIBBONS, DRAWINGS, PINS and MINIATURES.
He then inspects himself in the DRESSER MIRROR. He doesn't like
his face. THEN, in the background of the reflection, he notices
the opposite wall.

Jojo is at the wall now, it is bare. On the ground sits a
picture in a frame. He picks it up and is about to re-hang it
when HE SEES IT. The wall is scratched, there is a thin cut in
the wallpaper that measures from his shoulder to the ground.

He traces the line of the cut and sees that it moves at right
angles. It is a DOOR. The hook it would hang on is also used as
a handle to pull the door open.

Jojo takes his trusty DJ KNIFE and pries the door out a little,
at the same time holding the hook and pulling the door OPEN. The
light from the opposite window doesn't illuminate everything but
it does cast a wide beam into the darkness. As Jojo's eyes
momentarily adjust he begins making out objects. At first it's
only BOOKS.26.JOJOMama, the bad books. It's not allowed.

Then he sees a candle, bedding, a plate, a fork, and then a
PALE, LONG HAIRED CREATURE hunched in the corner, its face
partially hidden beneath dishevelled long black hair, its dark
eyes staring back at him.

Jojo jumps at the sight and backs away, tripping on the rug and
stumbling to the opposite wall which he bumps into DROPPING HIS
KNIFE on the ground.

He stays still, frozen in fear, watching. He can only   see the
darkness of the secret rooms interior now, that thing   is around
the corner, hidden from view. Footsteps. Slowly, with   listless
energy and no real purpose, a pale skinny little girl   emerges
from the darkness. This is ELSA KORR (15)

She stops at the doorway, and casually leans her thin arm,
against the frame. She wears a simple knee-length dress, brown
and dirty, and has bare feet.ELSAYou come to kill me, little boy?JOJOI...He can't say anything. A pause, and then she giggles. It is cute
and disarming at the same time. There's something attractive and
alluring about her.

Jojo can't speak. LEAVING HIS KNIFE he scuffles out the door,
getting out as fast as he can, down the hall, down the stairs.
He stops in the bottom hall and turns, listening.ELSA (O.S.)Joooooo-jooooooo...

STOMP. STOMP. STOMP. Footsteps on the stairs get louder.
Eventually Elsa rounds the corner and sits on the top stair,
they have distance between them.JOJOWho are you? What do you want? Are you
          a ghost?ELSA(smiling, spooking him)
          Yesssssssssss... a ghost.

She splays her arms out like a ghost.27.JOJOGet out! Get out of my house!ELSA(normal)
          Johannes, that's no way to treat a
          ghost.JOJOWhy do you live upstairs in the wall?!ELSAWhere else should a ghost live?JOJONot here!

He runs towards the front door but is too slow. Elsa jumps from
her position and bounding like a cat she reaches him as he gets
to the front door. She grabs him by the scruff of the neck and
slams him into the wall, breathing heavily from the effort.ELSADon't make me run kid, I'm far too
          hungry and y'know how much we have a
          taste for your blood.

Jojo is petrified, breathing heavily too. She gets in close,
reveals his DJ Knife. She holds it to his face.ELSA (CONT'D)You dropped something.
              (then)
          I'm not a ghost Johannes, I'm
          something worse. But I think you
          already know that, don't you? You know
          what I am.JOJONo.ELSAYes... Say it.JOJO(he gulps, futile)

          guest.JOJONo. It's not allowed.ELSAWhat will you do sweet Hitlerchen?

Silence. Jojo's eyes dart towards the door, and then the
telephone.ELSA (CONT'D)Of course. Go on then, go and tell
          them. But you know what happens if you
          do? I'll say you helped me, and your
          mother too. Then we'll all be kaput.
          And if you tell your mother you know
          about me... just one word...
              (raising the knife to his
               neck)
          I'll do the world a great big favour
          and CUT YOUR NAZI HEAD OFF. Got it?

She releases him and backs away still holding the knife.ELSA (CONT'D)I think I'll hold onto this. It's
          pretty.

She wanders back up the stairs leaving Jojo absolutely stunned.INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - JOJO'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATERJojo sits on his bed, petrified.ADOLF (O.S.)Sheesh, that was intense.

Hitler is sitting next to him.JOJOAdolf, what am I gonna do??ADOLFHonestly, NO idea. You're definitely
          in a pickle. How the hell did she get
          control like that?JOJOShe used her Jew powers I guess. Mind
          control.29.ADOLFIs that a real thing?

Jojo nods.ADOLF (CONT'D)I really should know about that.

Jojo nods again.ADOLF (CONT'D)Did you see how fast she moved? And
             now she's got that fancy knife.JOJOI know, I know! My knife! Okay, we
             have to think.

Adolf lights a smoke, offers one to Jojo. He waves it away.
Hitler looks worried as he takes a drag.ADOLFI've got it. Burn down the house.JOJOYou think?ADOLFIt's the only way.JOJOI might get in trouble.ADOLFGood point.
                 (snaps his fingers)
             Got it. Burn the house down, blame it
             on Winston Churchill.JOJONo, I can't do that. This is MY family
             home. I think I have to negotiate.ADOLFEven better! That's the spirit.
             Negotiate. Ooh, ooh, and remember,
             don't mention the war.INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALL - DAYFrom Inga's room we see an empty hallway. We hear clattering and
the slow clunking sound of footsteps getting closer.30.Jojo comes into view wearing various household objects as
ARMOUR; A CHEESE-GRATER protects his forearm and a CAST-IRON POT
sits on his head. In one hand he now holds a KITCHEN KNIFE. He
is tip-toeing yet his get-up is making a huge racket.INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - INGA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATERJojo stands in his sister's empty room. He speaks to the wall

Silence.JOJO (CONT'D)Ok well, I'll just say what I have to
           say.
                (beat)
           I don't think it's very convenient for
           you to be in my house and I'm not
           happy that my mother let you stay
           here. I'm sure she has her reasons but
           it really can't go on.
                (beat)
           Now, I'm aware you have my knife. I
           can't say I'm comfortable with that
           because it's a Nazi knife and you're
           obviously... Anyway, I just want you
           to know I'm not scared of you and I
           think you should find somewhere else
           to live. You have until tomorrow to

                (beat)
           Ok?

From behind, in his ear...ELSA (O.S.)Not okay.

Jojo spins to see Elsa standing directly behind him, holding his
knife, a wry smile on her face. Jojo SQUEALS and stumbles back
in fright, collapsing to the floor, his armour crashing around
him. He drops the KITCHEN KNIFE as he scurries out of the room.JOJOArrgh!!!31.INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - JOJO'S BEDROOM - DAYBack in his bedroom, the door firmly shut.ADOLFGreat, now she's got TWO knives!JOJOI know!ADOLFHow are you going to chop up stuff?!JOJOI don't know!ADOLFAnd she's still up there!JOJOYou're the expert, you think of

Hitler lights another cigarette, offers it to Jojo.JOJO (CONT'D)I don't smoke! Stop offering me
          fucking cigarettes! I'm TEN!ADOLFSorry, sorry, this is stressful.

They start pacing, thinking, pacing, thinking... Hitler produces
a CAN OF GASOLINE and some MATCHES. Jojo waves it away. They
pace and think some more... As Jojo paces back he turns to see
Hitler has made a giant MOUSETRAP CONTRAPTION. He gestures "What
about this?" Jojo shrugs, "Maybe"... and paces some more.ADOLF (CONT'D)Okay, let's talk like turkeys. I guess
          you can't tell your mother or the Jew
          will cut off your Nazi head. No real
          way around that right now. But y'know,
          there's no reason this thing in the
          attic needs to ruin your life. I think
          you could use it to your advantage.JOJOHow?ADOLFWell, when someone tries to use mind-
          powers on me, you know what I do?(MORE)32.ADOLF (CONT'D)(beat)
          Use mind powers back on them.

Jojo perks up.ADOLF (CONT'D)Remember last year when that pirate,
          Von Stauffenberg tried to blow me up
          with a bomb?JOJOYeah, but you survived.ADOLFCorrect-a-mundo. But the only reason I
          survived, apart from having bomb-proof
          legs, is because I outwitted old Von
          Stauffy. I let him think I was dead
          when in actual fact I was fine. By
          pretending I was dead I drew out all
          the traitors. So, what are you going
          to do?JOJOPretend I'm dead?ADOLFExactly. Wait. No. I think what I mean
          is this: Make her feel safe and she
          will drop her guard and then you will
          be the one in control.JOJOIs that "Reverse Psychology"?ADOLFUmm, I don't think so. Let's not
          complicate things. Stick with my idea -
          use mind-powers back on her - and
          you'll be fine.
              (checks his watch)
          I gotta go. Good luck and remember the
          old saying: a Jew living in your wall
          is better than a two Jews flying
          around eating innocent Nazis.

He climbs out the window.ADOLF (CONT'D)And don't give her any more KNIVES!

He winks and is gone. Out on Jojo's worried face.33.INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENINGJojo sits in the living room, a look of utter fear and confusion
covers his face. The house is silent save for the ticking of a
clock.INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENINGJojo stands in the kitchen holding a piece of bread in his hand,
still staring into space. A tap drips to the same rhythm of the
clock.EXT. JOJO'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - EVENINGJojo waits on the steps of his house. The sound of dripping is

No answer, Frau Betzler notices one of Jojo's laces are untied
again.FRAU BETZLER(crouching to tie them)

             What?

Jojo keeps watching, trying to work her out.JOJO(staring at his mother)
             Inga. Her ghost is here.FRAU BETZLER(laughing)
             Oh for Heaven's sake what are you
             talking about?JOJONoises.FRAU BETZLEROh come on. You mean the RATS?! We
             have rats in the attic and yes, I've
             heard them too. Honestly, ghosts?!

JOJO'S HOUSE - JOJO'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATERFrau Betzler tucks Jojo into bed.JOJOMama, do you miss papa?FRAU BETZLERLike the sun misses the moon.JOJOAnd you miss Inga.FRAU BETZLERLike the moon misses the sun.JOJOAre you going to bed now?FRAU BETZLEROf course. I need to tidy up some
          things before bed.JOJOWhat things?FRAU BETZLERMama things. Boy, you really have to
          trust me, I'm the boss here.

A beautiful smile appears across her face, she WINKS. Jojo can't
help a tiny smirk, he tries a return wink but can't.FRAU BETZLER (CONT'D)Like this.

She demonstrates and winks again, Jojo attempts a return wink
but isn't getting it.FRAU BETZLER (CONT'D)Yeah, but with just one eye. You can
          do it.36.They continue this hopeful exchange a few more times. She
eventually places a finger over one of his eyes. He blinks his
other eye.FRAU BETZLER (CONT'D)There you go! You got it! Now go get
          my gloves, will ya? I left them by a
          rainbow.

She kisses him good-night and turns out the light.INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - BEDROOM/KITCHEN - NIGHTJojo lies in bed, wide awake. We hear a door creak open and
footsteps heading down the hall.

Leaving the safety of his room, Jojo creeps along the hall and
sees candle-light coming from the kitchen. He peers round the
corner and sees a glimpse of his mother's nightgown as she
prepares something on a plate and disappears around the corner,
tiptoeing upstairs. Jojo follows...INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHTJojo reaches the top of the stairs in time to see his mother
entering his sister's room. He stealthily makes his way to the
doorway and sees his mother knocks twice, lightly on a wall,
before removing a panel in the wall, pulling it out towards her.
She whispers something into the darkness of the SECRET ROOM. She
holds out the plate of food and a glass of water. Jojo's eyes
widen and he trembles with fear as Elsa's bony white arm extends
from the darkness, her spidery hand opening up and taking the
food. His mother whispers something else and then strokes the
arm, almost like a pet. Jojo steps back into the hall, backing
further away from what he has just seen.JOJO(whispering)
          Mama what are you doing?? It's not
          allowed...INT. REHABILITATION CENTRE - DAYJojo swims in a pool with various other wounded men. Jojo is
helped by an older woman, HELGA. She stretches his arms.HELGAYes, stretch, you must stretch. Now
          squeeze my hand. Squeeze!37.A man swims past. He has no arms. Another man has no limbs,
another no face at all.

Hitler swims by wearing a bathing cap, He is looking around at
all the disabled people. He turns back to Jojo, an expression on
his face that says: "How gross are these freaks??" Jojo is
carried away by Helga to the other side of the pool.INT. REICHSJUGENDAMT - DAYJojo collects the small pile of CONSCRIPTIONS for the day and
approaches Herr Klenzendorf's office. He enters and we find
Klenzendorf drawing pictures of FANTASY GUNS. Finkel sits at a
smaller table playing with PINK TRIANGLE PATCHES. He holds them
together like a sash and holds them across his chest, smiling at
his pink fashion creation.JOJOExcuse me, Herr Klenzendorf.

Finkel drops the pink patches.KLENZENDORF(showing his drawing)
          Ahh, Jojo. What do you think of this?
          It's a type of Gatling Gun. It is also
          mounted with a radio which emits
          annoying music to deflect the enemy. I
          was thinking Pachelbel would be good.JOJODo you do any actual real work?KLENZENDORFNope. However, now and then I help out
          the Grey Goons.JOJOWho?KLENZENDORFGestapo. They are low on numbers so
          sometimes they make me help them with
          their investigations.JOJOAh, that must be exciting, solving
          crimes and finding people.KLENZENDORFHonestly, they couldn't find arse in a
          shit factory, but if you're looking
          for someone they're your best bet.(MORE)38.KLENZENDORF (CONT'D)It's actually quite boring but at
          least I get out of this office and
          away from the children. My true place
          is at the front. I'm a soldier, not a
          baby-sitter.

Jojo sits, time for business.JOJOCan I ask you about Jews?KLENZENDORFOh God, why?JOJOI'm curious. What happens if I see
          one?KLENZENDORFHide the end of your penis!

He collapses into laughter. Finkel joins in, wobbling on his
seat like a giggling jello. Klenzendorf encourages him by miming
a CIRCUMCISION.KLENZENDORF (CONT'D)Ha haha, oh boy, I needed that.FINKELOh yes, me too Captain K. I really
          needed to laugh.KLENZENDORFOk, so in reality if you see a Jew you
          tell us and then we tell the Gestapo
          and they tell the SS and then they go
          and kill the Jew. And anyone who
          helped the Jew. And, because these are
          very paranoid times, probably some
          other people just in case. It's very
          convoluted.

Jojo gulps.JOJOEven if the Jew hypnotised someone to
          make them hide the Jew in the first
          place?KLENZENDORFErr, yep. Though I'd be amazed if that
          could happen. Did you see one?39.JOJONope. I wouldn't be able to tell even
          if I did.KLENZENDORFMe neither. Without their funny hats
          it's damn near impossible. Someone
          should write a book on the subject.

This sparks an idea.JOJOI have to go deliver these
          conscriptions.KLENZENDORFYes, good man. And watch your willy
          out there.

He mimes a pair of scissors `SNIP SNIP' and collapses into a fit
of laughter again, joined by the over-exuberant Finkel.INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - INGA'S BEDROOM - MORNINGJojo stands in his sister's room, while Elsa sits in the doorway
to her hideout. She still has the knife and digs it into the
floor.JOJOOk here's the situation. If I tell on
          you, you'll be in big trouble and I
          don't think you want that. But then
          you'll tell on me and my mother, which
          I don't want. And if you tell my
          mother I know, then she'll kick you
          out which you don't want. And if I
          tell my mother I know, then you'll cut
          off my head, which I don't want.ELSAA stalemate.JOJOIndeed. So, we must make a compromise.
          I have thought deeply about this and I
          now conclude that it's better to have
          you locked up in the house rather than
          letting you run around town causing
          Jewish havoc.ELSAI see.40.JOJOHowever, I have some conditions for
          allowing you to stay here in my house.ELSAConditions?JOJOYes. I will not cause any trouble for
          you if you promise to tell me
          everything about the Jewish race.ELSAOk. We're like you but human. Done.JOJOPlease take this seriously. I want to
          know all your secrets, how you shape-
          shift, what you eat, how to tell a Jew
          from a real person and, where you
          build your hives. Think of it as an

          telling me about your   kind. I'm

Elsa laughs and moves away from the window.ELSAOk. We are demons who love money,
          that's clear right?JOJOOf course.ELSABut what people don't know is that we
          are also allergic to food.JOJOWhat?ELSACheese, bread and sausages. Those

Jojo is puzzled. Finally gets it.43.JOJOVery funny.ELSAI'm going back in my cave, the

Suddenly we hear the front door open and Frau Betzler bursting
in, flustered. She closes the door loudly and in a loud voice:44.FRAU BETZLER (O.S.)Hallo house! I'm home!

Hitler scurries around the room in a panic looking for somewhere
to hide and finding nothing, hugs the wall. He closes his eyes
tightly and holds his breath.JOJO(whispering)

Indian, frozen in a pose that doesn't blend in to his
surroundings.ADOLF (CONT'D)(whispering)
          It also helps if I can't see her.

to file reports and denounce other citizens. Jojo approaches a
SECRETARY who, upon seeing his face, cringes.SECRETARY(then, disinterested)

He sits back, NOTHING. Erwin scratches some more.INT. TOWN - LIBRARY - DAYJojo walks down an aisle of the local library. He scans the
scant shelves and finds what he was looking for; RILKE: POEMS
AND ESSAYS. He pulls it out and secretly stuffs it into his
jacket. He turns around and sees Hitler stuffing his own jacket
with about 20 books. They spill out, onto the floor.HITLERGreat thinking, Rabbit. We'll use
          these to make a fake floor that she

seems others are joining in his song. He looks around and the
sound gets louder. From around a corner, lead by FRAULEIN RAHM,
we see a group of "Jungvolk" marching and singing...JUNGVOLKWe are marching for Hitler through
          Night and Need, with the flag of the

Jojo moves against the wall and watches them pass. It is
glorious - he catches the eye of a couple of the kids. They
smirk and look at him with contempt.FRAULEIN RAHMCome on everyone, one more time!

down the hall and then a door closing softly. Hitler makes a
military gesture to take action, Jojo moves out into the dark
hallway.INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - INGA'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOONJojo knocks on Elsa's wall-door.ELSA (O.S.)I wonder who it could possibly be?56.JOJOIt's Johannes Betzler. The little boy
          who lives downstairs.ELSA (O.S.)I knowwwwww...JOJOOh. Well, I have something to tell
          you. I happened to be doing some
          important filing today and I came
          across an old letter from Nathan -
          your fianc�e - addressed to you. It's
          quite lucky I found it.ELSA (O.S.)What the hell are you talking about?JOJOI have a letter from Nathan. Shall I
          read it to you?

Pause. Elsa opens the door a little. We see a piece of her face
in the thin beam of light. Jojo unfolds a piece of paper - we
can see that the writing is not that of a 17 year-old but that
of a 10 year-old.ELSADear Elsa, this is hard for me to say
          but I don't want to marry you anymore.
          I found another woman and we laugh and
          have good talks. I'm sure there's
          better people for you anyway. It's
          like my favourite poet Rilke says:
          "We need, in love, to practice only
          this: letting each other go."
          So goodbye and sorry about dumping
          you. From Nathan your ex-fianc�e.
          PS. I am not really in the resistance
          I was lying. I am unemployed.

Jojo shuffles out of the room as Elsa continues to cry.57.INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - INGA'S BEDROOM - LATERJojo is back. He knocks lightly on Elsa's wall.JOJOHi.

He knocks lightly again.JOJO (CONT'D)Are you still alive?ELSA (O.S.)Barely.JOJOOh, well that's good. Um, don't open
          the door because it's risky today. So
          I actually forgot there was a second
          letter. I forgot I had it. I'll just
          read it.
              (reading)
          Dear Elsa. I just wanted to say that I
          don't want to break up with you now. I
          changed my mind because I don't want
          you to kill yourself over me which a
          couple of girls have done in the past
          and it gives me nightmares.

          So, let's still get married sometime -
          even though I truly am unemployed and

hands three RATION CARDS to the STOREMAN.STOREMANThree? I remember you only used two in
          the past.FRAU BETZLERAh, yes, but I have developed a more
          efficient system. I now use 3 ration
          cards, taking enough for 2 to eat, but
          then we take twice as long to eat it,
          you see? 3 for 2, which makes 6. But
          here's where it gets interesting; you
          take the original number times it by
          3, carry the 7, subtract 2, then add 2
          again (because secretly you need the
          2), then divide the whole thing by the
          potatoes.

          Simple, no?60.The Storeman looks puzzled and a couple of other people in line

              (she takes a breath)

Jojo takes a pen and starts writing furiously in his book.ELSAScary places full of strange and

          of developing magic and spells, we
          slowly moved out of the caves and into

          caves and stayed in our normal bodies.JOJOWhich are... blobs or something?66.ELSAWell, I'll draw them for you.

She takes Jojo's book and starts drawing. Jojo watches her
elegant hands as they create the picture. She hands the book
back to Jojo; it is a beautiful sketch of a WEIRD creature that
is more like an ELF or FAIRY. Definitely not Jewish or a
monster.ELSA (CONT'D)It would be better with colour but all
          I have is this blunt pencil.JOJOWhere's the horns?ELSAUm, they're under the hair.JOJOWhere are yours?ELSAI'm too young. They grow when you turn21.JOJO(of course!)

          interesting thing is that we can read
          each others' minds.JOJOEveryone's minds? What about German
          minds?ELSANo, they are too thick for us to

PUFFY-HIPPED PANTS that WW2 Generals wear.ADOLF (CONT'D)Hey do you think this uniform is
          slimming? I'm not sure about the hips

          thighs look absolutely HUGE.JOJOYou look great. As usual.ADOLFWhat about the moustache? I'm thinking
          about losing it. It seemed like a
          great idea at first but now I'm not
          sure. It's always there, like a little
          black worm. Whenever I look at my face
          I just see this stupid thing crawling
          on my lip.JOJOWell, it's kind of your trademark now.ADOLF(feeling his moustache)
          You're right. I guess I'll keep it.

          make me feel better. You're like an
          honest and reliable son to me.JOJOAnd you're like a fashionable dad.

Throughout this very short monologue, Adolf Hitler builds in
energy, resembling for the first time, the intense yet
charismatic Hitler we know from the famous speeches.70.ADOLFBe careful Jojo, and remember this
          good advice from me. Once you see
          what's in her mind and where she's
          trying to get you to go - in your own
          head, you must go the other way. Don't
          let her put you in a brain prison! You
          must be strong, you must always be
          alert and ready for anything. She's
          dangerous and cunning like an
          unpredictable baby opossum. Before you
          know it, you've got that thing
          clinging to your face, and that, dear

He has worked himself up into quite a frenzy. Jojo stares at him
with love and admiration.JOJOI won't let my brain be bossed around
          by her, mein F�hrer.ADOLFTry not to. Bossing around people's
          brains is extremely rude and uncalled
          for. It looks like you've got a lot of
          good information so far. Now to share
          it with others, yes?

Jojo nods. Hitler goes to leave.JOJOUm Adolf, do you think I'm... ugly?ADOLFIs that a trick question?
              (he ponders, then)
          Is there another word for ugly but not
          quite as offensive?JOJOI don't think so.ADOLFWell if there was, that'd be you to a
          tee. Anyway, ugly isn't a bad thing.
          Field Marshal Rommel was absolutely
          hideous but he made up for it with
          great joke telling abilities.

more. He scowls at himself and turns out the light.INT. REICHSJUGENDAMT - DAYJojo enters the office and is immediately greeted by Captain
Klenzendorf who sits at a desk drawing.KLENZENDORFHeyyy, look who it is!OFFICER 1The Handgrenade kid!KLENZENDORFSo, how can we help you today? Are you
          missing a pee-pee?

          down from the ceiling, like bats?KLENZENDORF(nodding, enjoying this)
          Ok, bats, yes.72.JOJOAnd another thing you might be
          interested to know is they can read

He trails off, not able to make a good joke. Jojo opens his book
and the giggling officers gather to inspect his fantastical
drawings and writings, all carefully penned in the hand of a 10-
year old. The adults try to contain their amusement.KLENZENDORFOh my, look at that. This guy is

          wonderful Vienna. But boy, you do have
          an imagination on you, I love it!JOJOBut it's real, not imagina--KLENZENDORFOh, of course it is! When I was your
          age I had a "friend" called Kack who
          used wet my bed when I was asleep. He
          got me in so much trouble.

He holds up a sketch of a man wearing a tasselled uniform, cape,
and large PIRATE HAT.KLENZENDORF (CONT'D)It's based loosely on East Asian
          fashions but also has a distinct
          pirate skew. Sort of warrior meets
          musketeer. Note the feathers down the
          arms for aerodynamics. The sparkly
          collar is to dazzle the enemy and the
          pirate hat is purely decorational.

earlier are falling down. He tries to stick one back up but it
immediately falls down again.75.VOICE (O.S.)Jojo?

He turns to see YORKI approaching.JOJOYorki!

The two embrace. Jojo steps back to take in his old friend who
dressed in a soldier's uniform. But it's still the same old
Yorki, clumsy and a bit pudgy.JOJO (CONT'D)You're a soldier?YORKIAt your service!JOJOBut you're only 12.YORKII know! They think we're just as good
          as the older lads so they're
          recruiting us early. And look at this
          uniform, it's state of the art!

Jojo feels the uniform. It is made out of CARDBOARD covered inGREEN MATERIAL.JOJOIt's thin. Is that... paper?YORKIHmm, that's what I thought at first
          too. But it's "paper like". It's the
          latest material invented by our top
          scientists. It keeps you warm in snow
          and cool in the desert. It's also
          impervious to shrapnel, bullets and
          some bombs. And, because it will never
          degrade I can grow into it!

He holds up his arm, the sleeve is way too long.JOJOWell, I'm impressed. You finally made

AGENTS led by an officious CAPTAIN DEERTZ.DEERTZHeil Hitler. Allow me to introduce
          myself. I am Captain Herman Deertz of
          the Vienna Gestapo, Floridsdorf

They are interrupted by Captain Klenzendorf entering, late,
carrying a bicycle, trailed by Finkel. The other agents look
down on Klenzendorf.81.DEERTZAh, Klenzendorf. Heil Hitler.KLENZENDORFHeil Hitler.

Finkel joins in and the two men Heil Hitler everyone in the room
all over again. Finally...JOJOHeil Hitler...KLENZENDORFYes Johannes, we've Heil Hitler'd you

          So, did I miss anything?DEERTZNo, we were just Heil Hitlering each
          other and were about to ransack the
          house.

He nods to the other agents who start snooping around the house,
inspecting drawers, cupboards, shelves. Deertz smiles and moves
into the Living Room. Jojo and Klenzendorf follow. Deertz
examines the plate of potatoes. Sees the nibbled one, then theTWO SETS OF CUTLERY.DEERTZ (CONT'D)So, young Jojo, We hear you have been
          helping out at the Hitlerjugend

          citizens had your commitment.KLENZENDORFJohannes is a fantastic volunteer.
          He's very imaginative.

Deertz moves to the book-case, looks at the literature. The
other two officers make notes and start trudging up the stairs.
Deertz leads Jojo and Klenzendorf down the hall. They stop at
Jojo's room. Deertz peeks inside.DEERTZYour room?
              (entering)
          Nice drawings! Wow, look at this.82.He points at a drawing of David killing Goliath.DEERTZ (CONT'D)This kid is killing a giant. You see
          this Klenzendorf?KLENZENDORFYes, these are well executed. Did you
          know I also draw? I have better
          perspective and shading too.

          Why don't we go upstairs and see. Yes?

He puts an arm around Jojo and they head upstairs.INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALL - CONTINUOUSThey stop at Jojo's mother's room. The officers are looking
through her dresser and wardrobe, under the mattress.83.DEERTZDo you know where your mother is?JOJONo. I think she's in town.

Klenzendorf exhales heavily, clearly uncomfortable.DEERTZIs she? Hm.

Jojo looks down to his little sheath, it is still empty. From
behind them.ELSA (O.S.)It's here.

They turn to see Elsa standing at the door to Inga's room. She
holds the knife in her hand and wears a dress and shirt of
Inga's. She looks beautiful and... quite German. Jojo is wide-
eyed, panicked.DEERTZAnd who might you be?ELSAWho might YOU be? And what are you

stall.JOJOHeil Hitler.84.ELSAHeil. Hitler.DEERTZHeil Hitler.

The others agents join in and we go through another long round
of Heil Hitler salutes, this time with Elsa.DEERTZ (CONT'D)I didn't know you had a sister,
          Johannes.ELSAWell sometimes he'd prefer I was dead.
          Wouldn't you, little Frankenstein?DEERTZNow, now, no need to attack his

          refuses to stay out of it.DEERTZWhat do you have hidden in there?ELSA(smiling)
          Oh you know, girl's stuff.

Deertz goes to enter Inga's room.DEERTZMay I?ELSANaturally.

He wanders in, inspecting the room. He walks past Elsa's secret
door where the painting that covers it hangs crooked.
Klenzendorf enters and walks past Jojo, eyeing him.85.DEERTZYou see we deal with an overwhelming
          number of reports, denunciations, and
          general investigations which means we
          are severely understaffed and
          overworked.

He opens the curtains and looks out the window. We hear a
scraping sound and reveal that Klenzendorf is straightening the
painting. He then stands in front of the wall opening,
concealing it.DEERTZ (CONT'D)Now, of course we are indeed
          interested in problems of crime and
          anti-party sentiment, but we still
          have one greater concern; that of the
          Goldilocksies, running around out
          there taking advantage of other people
          in this city. Sneaking around, taking
          things, eating people's food, wearing
          their clothes... It's simply rude.
              (beat, to Elsa)
          I don't suppose we could see your
          papers could I?

Elsa freezes.DEERTZ (CONT'D)Hmm?KLENZENDORFPapers! Quick, we don't have all day.

He holds out his hand.ELSAYes, of course.

Elsa goes to a drawer in Inga's dresser and pulls out INGA'S
PAPERS. Her hand is beginning to shake, Klenzendorf takes the
papers from her and looks at them, now and then flicking a look
to Elsa.

POV of the papers shows Inga when she was sick, GAUNT and PALE;
the two girls share a vague resemblance. The DATE OF BIRTH
reads: May 7, 1929.KLENZENDORFHow old are you in this photo?ELSAThey're 3 years old, I was 12.86.KLENZENDORFDate of birth?

A tense moment as Elsa pauses. A pin dropping would be quite
audible right now...ELSAMay 1, 1929.

Another long pause. Elsa wipes her sweaty hand on her dress.KLENZENDORFCorrect.
                 (beat)
             Thank you Inga. Get a new photo.

Klenzendorf hands the papers back while the other agents arrive
from Frau Betzler's room. They hand Deertz some envelopes and
photos and papers.DEERTZGood good. Well, we'll be borrowing
             some of these little things if you
             don't mind. Nice meeting you.ELSAHeil Hitler.

             anything suspicious.

The officers leave. Klenzendorf stares at Jojo then smiles.KLENZENDORFListen Johannes, we are scaling down
             our operations at the Jugend office so
             there's not really any work for you

             required.

Jojo nods.KLENZENDORF (CONT'D)Take care Jojo. Stay home. Look after
             yourself.87.He gives a concerned, yet endearing smile, then leaves.INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - ELSA'S HIDEOUT - MOMENTS LATERElsa sits huddled in the corner, clutching Inga's papers. Jojo
approaches.JOJOElsa, you fooled them. Elsa?ELSAMay 7.JOJOWhat?ELSAShe was born May 7, not the first.

Jojo takes the papers and reads.ELSA (CONT'D)They'll be back. They'll find out
          she's dead. Then I'll be dead. I have
          to leave here. I have to get out.JOJONo. He's helping us. Either way no one

          died. You can be her Elsa. It's okay,
          I'll tell mama I know about you and
          that we're friends...

Elsa retreats away from Jojo.ELSAJew and Nazi are not friends.

This hits Jojo, he steps back. Elsa buries her head into her
hands and begin to cry. Jojo waits a moment and then moves
downstairs.88.INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATERAdolf Hitler wears oven gloves and stirs a pot that is heating

He walks out, dramatically knocking over a cup.EXT. TOWN - FOOD STORE - MORNINGJojo is at the FOOD STORE. He hands over ONE RATION CARD. In
return they give him a tiny piece of bread and a small piece of
butter. He puts them in his pocket and leaves.EXT. TOWN SQUARE - FLORIDSDORFER SPITZ - AFTERNOONJojo wheels his barrow down an alley which opens up into
Floridsdorfer Spitz, a town square. He rests a moment and sees a
BUTTERFLY moving past him along a row of flowers.

Jojo smiles at this, takes interest and follows the butterfly,
limping behind as it flutters along the flower bed. He moves
further away from his barrow and into the park proper, moving
around a few trees. He crouches and admires the butterfly which
has now come to a stop upon another flower. Not yet looking up
Jojo notices the light on the ground is disturbed by shadows
moving back and forth. He looks up and sees he is standing near
the site of the PUBLIC HANGING. TEN or so bodies hang from the
gallows.

A sign nailed to a nearby tree reveals these people have been
executed for treason, crimes against the Reich and involvement
with a Resistance movement. Painted in white across the bodies'
chests we see:O5The bodies sway in the wind in a kind of floating waltz. Jojo
tilts his head back and forth in rhythm and shuffles along the
row of bodies. Most are men, a couple of girls. Then as he nears
the row he sees one body in a dirty dress, a woman drifting in
the breeze, twisting on the rope until she turns towards us,
fully revealing her face... his MOTHER, FRAU BETZLER.90.Jojo steps back, falls to the ground, eyes wide open, staring
back at her. He begins to cry, suddenly losing his brave
exterior and becoming the 10 year old child he is.

Jojo gets to his feet, goes to his mother and tries to reach her
hand. It is too high. He looks down her body and notices her
shoelace is untied. He tries to re-tie it but fumbles. He gives
up and rests his head against her leg.EXT. TOWN SQUARE - FLORIDSDORFER SPITZ - DUSKAs the sun sets Jojo remains in the park, sitting near his
mother, quiet and still.

A pair of shiny shoes appear next to Jojo. He looks up to see
Adolf Hitler staring back at him with sympathetic eyes.

Jojo hangs his head again. Adolf touches him on the shoulder and
disappears into the night.INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - ELSA'S HIDEOUT - NIGHTElsa reads by candlelight. The panel opens and Jojo stands

struggle against each other.ELSA (CONT'D)Jojo, stop!

collapses to the ground. He lies on his back and stares upwards.JOJOMama...

Hitler and propaganda notices. Some of the Hitler pictures have
been torn away leaving half of the Fuhrer's face.

          I had the pleasure of seeing some
          really great drawings by a young girl
          from Austria named Elsa Korr. She
          certainly has an eye for detail; her
          pictures of butterflies are
          incredible. And I loved the drawing of
          the man riding a giraffe. But what
          really stood out was the one of the
          interesting little boy. It made me
          wonder a lot about him and what he was
          thinking about because he looked like
          he was thinking about stuff. Overall
          it was a great collection and I see a
          bright future for this girl, wherever
          she is. I encourage her to keep going
          with the drawings.

there is an even bigger collection of drawings inside.

A distant explosion is heard, the rumbling causing objects and
windows to shake and rattle. The sound of gunshots comes soon
after. Jojo rushes out.EXT. GRUSCH GROCERY - DAYJojo heads down a street and finds a group of civilian locals
being given weapons and instructions on how to use them. There
are a couple of women and young boys among them, all looking
very out of their element and bewildered. Two younger kids help
each other carry a huge MACHINE GUN off towards the fighting.

An explosion a few blocks away. Civilians run the opposite way
towards safety. Jojo runs too. He rounds a corner and sees
Yorki, his uniform in tatters, running on the other side of the
street carrying boxes of ammunition and a ROCKET LAUNCHER.JOJOYorki!

Yorki sees Jojo, waves, trips and falls, accidentally FIRING the
Rocket Launcher. It launches a missile across the road,
completely blowing out a store front. GLASS and DEBRIS shower
the street.YORKIShit! Jojo, you okay?! I'm so clumsy.JOJOYorki, what's going on?YORKIThe Russians Jojo, they're coming. And
          the Americans from the other way. And

          out of money. I mean look at this
          uniform, it really IS made of paper.
          They just glued a layer thin cotton
          over the top of it.

He turns around and see the back of his jacket has been
completely burned off. We see it is made of CARDBOARD covered in
thin COTTON.YORKI (CONT'D)You're lucky you got out, this is
          crazy. Go and hide, buddy.

He tries to lift the boxes of ammunition up again but has
difficulty.YORKI (CONT'D)Shit, and someone should tell you how
          heavy guns and bullets are.JOJOWhat's it like out there?YORKIUmmm... shitty. It's fun at first but

          Wait, what's that annoying music?

Just then, we hear PACHELBEL'S CANON in D and we see KLENZENDORF
run past, stopping near the boys. We see that he is wearing his
uniform but it has been altered according to his earlier
drawing. It has SPARKLY SEQUINS on the collar and TASSELS down
the sleeves. He wears HIGH HEEL BOOTS and is carrying a MACHINE
GUN which has a RADIO strapped to it, playing the music.
Obviously, he's also wearing a PIRATE HAT.

Finkel runs up, dressed in a similar outfit, but he wears a cape
made of pink triangle patches. He stands proudly next to Captain
K, there is an electric energy between them. Klenzendorf gives a
triumphant smile, doffs his pirate hat and runs off, Finkel
close behind, Pachelbel swelling.YORKI (CONT'D)Okay, I gotta go Jojo, the guys need
          these bullets.JOJOWe were born to die for Germany.YORKIYeah? Well I'm still not gonna laugh

He heads across the plaza, the gunfire gets louder. Jojo calls
out.JOJOYorki, you're my best friend!

But Yorki can't hear him, he continues around the corner, out of
sight. There are more shots and yelling. Suddenly a huge
explosion rocks the street, debris and smoke pours around the
corner and back into the square. Jojo hides behind a tree and
watches as German soldiers come running from the street, some
are gunned down, others hide behind vehicles and continue to
engage the enemy. Klenzendorf runs around too, his Pirate Hat is
on fire.

Jojo runs back up a side-street, away from the chaos.FADE OUT.98.SFX: TRIUMPHANT MUSIC AND THE SOUND OF TANKS ROLLINGEXT. TOWN - STREET - DAYJojo walks down a street, music blares, an anthem of some sort.
He stares wide-eyed as the CANNIBAL TRIBES of RUSSIA, GREAT
BRITAIN, and AMERICA parade down the street. Some people are
waving, happy. Others devastated, unwilling to accept defeat.

A Russian soldier passes by and thrusts a small Union-Jack flag
into Jojo's hand. He says something indecipherable and continues
on. An excitable WOMAN (30 plus holding her child) runs past
them.JOJOWhat's happening?WOMANIt's over! The war is over! We will

in line at a FOOD RATION STATION, holding a bag. Among the
GERMAN CIVILIANS and RUSSIAN TROOPS he feels like a stranger. A
tank rumbles past with the sounds of Soviet music wafting out.

He stumbles upon a make-shift morgue for the casualties of the
final battle for Vienna. He walks past many dead German boys and
men. Some are draped in their ARMY COATS. He stops near one who
lies the same way. He pulls the Army Coat off the body... it is
a stranger but a young lad all the same. Jojo rolls up the coat
and puts it under his arm.INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - INGA'S BEDROOM - EVENINGWearing the jacket, Jojo stands at the door to Elsa's room. He

busting into a house, looting it. Others are pushing an old
piano out of a window as locals watch on. Gunshots are heard
across the city.

Jojo enters the square where he found his mother. There is some
commotion on the other side of the trees. He walks over and sees
a group of German men and women who have been rounded up by an
angry mob. Temporary police made up of Russians do little as
they are taunted and beaten and spat on.

Among the group being rounded up Jojo sees OFFICER DEERTZ,
FRAULEIN RAHM and also HERR KLENZENDORF, his revamped uniform is
tatters. Jojo's spying NEIGHBOURS are also with their group,
stumbling around looking desperate. They are all being jostled
about by PARTISANS and LOCALS and Jojo watches as Fraulein Rahm,
his teacher from Hitlerjugend Camp gets dragged from the group.

Someone SPITS in her face. Her and FIVE OTHERS are led to a
STONE WALL and lined up. Before we see what happens next Jojo
finds himself carried with the wave of bystanders where he
passes another group of prisoners.

It is here that he meets with Captain Klenzendorf. They make eye-
contact and we see Klenzendorf has been beaten up. Nevertheless,
he gives a nice warm, gentle smile.JOJOCaptain K.KLENZENDORFHeya kid. Look at all this commotion,

A brief moment as Klenzendorf stares at Jojo.KLENZENDORFOh, I've seen him round but I don't
          know him. Go away little boy.PARTISANYeah, go away ugly little gypsy. Scat!

Jojo is pushed back into the crowd, losing sight of Klenzendorf.
Someone calls out a command, indecipherable amongst the cries of
the crazed crowd. As Jojo pushes his way to the back of the mob
we see over the top of the crowd that Klenzendorf and some
others are standing in a line, on a platform. He doesn't look
back and so doesn't see all five of them drop out of sight, the
ropes around their necks going tight. All we hear are gasps and
cheers.EXT. TOWN - RIVER - DAYJojo sits on the banks of the river. He watches the water flow
past him as more gunshots and cheering can be heard in the
distance.

He looks over at the bridge and sees a young couple holding
hands, happy. Coming the opposite way, towards Jojo, is YORKI.
They embrace.YORKIJojo!JOJOYorki! I thought you were surely dead.105.YORKINo, I can never die! I fell in a hole
          and luckily I'm a little bit fat so I
          got stuck. Anyway, a tank parked over
          the top of my hole and then that got
          blown up and it was a whole 2 days
          before anyone found me.JOJOI'm glad they did.YORKIMe too. I lost three Pounds!
              (then)
          Did you hear? About Hitler?JOJOWhat?YORKIHe's dead. They say he killed himself.

Jojo stares dead ahead.JOJOBullshit. He wouldn't.YORKIHe did. He was in a bunker and the
          Russians were all outside and he had
          nowhere to run and so he did it. He
          just blew his brains out. All over the
          wall.JOJOHe blew his brains out?YORKIAll over the wall. Brains everywhere.
          Betrayed us all. Turns out he was
          hiding a lot of stuff from us. Doing
          some really bad things behind
          everyone's backs. Especially in the
          "constipation camps".JOJOWhat?YORKII don't really know the details.
          Also... look at this.106.He hands Jojo a pile of letters, all addressed to Roswita
Betzler, his mother. Jojo sorts through the mail, opens an
envelope.YORKI (CONT'D)There's a whole section at the post-
          office. Did I mention I'm a postman
          now? Anyway, there's a bunch of
          letters that were confiscated because
          of security stuff but I was snooping
          around and I found them.JOJOThey're from my father.
              (looking up, smiling)
          This one is from last week. He's been
          in Switzerland.
              (then)
          I guess he was a deserter after all.YORKIThat's ok, I would have too if I had
          known what it was like.

They sit for a moment.JOJOCan I come and stay at your place for
          a while? Until my dad comes home?YORKISure. That's probably a good idea,
          they're sending orphans to Hungary.
          That's bad, I heard Hungarians bathe
          in human blood. Dracula's from
          somewhere round there so it makes
          sense. Yeah, come and stay. You can be
          my brother.JOJOI'd like that.
              (then)
          I'm not alone.INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - INGA'S BEDROOM - DAYJojo enters the room wearing a suit that's too big for him. The
sleeves and pants are rolled up. He places a sandwich on the
floor near Elsa's door. He takes a piece of paper and facing
Elsa's wall he reads...107.JOJOI managed to find another letter for
          you at the post office. It's from
          Nathan.
              (beat, reading)
          Dear Elsa, I hope you aren't too sad
          about the result of the war. Oh well.
          But it's not the end of the world.
          There are still small areas on Earth
          where it's ok not to be a Nazi so
          please stay alive. Thank God you have
          your good friend Johannes to look
          after you. He really is a fabulous
          person, so brave.
              (wincing, is this too much?)
          Soooo very brave. It is important that
          you stay alive and healthy until I
          find you. So eat food, including
          sandwiches, if there are any. I love
          you, Nathan.

Silence. Jojo folds up the letter and puts it in his pocket.
Elsa opens the door again.ELSAHi.JOJOHi.

Pause.ELSAHe's dead.JOJOUm, pardon?ELSANathan.
              (then)
          Last winter. Tuberculosis.JOJOBut then who wrote this...?ELSA(smiling)
          Thank you, kind Jojo. You see, I was
          right. You are not one of them.
              (beat)
          How's it going out there?108.JOJOOkay. How's it going in there?ELSAFabulous.JOJOWe're friends, right?ELSAI'm not sure we're allowed to be,
remember the rules.JOJOI know but, I think it's ok if no one
knows. I don't mind hanging out with
you.ELSAI don't mind hanging out with you
either.JOJOAnd if we're friends you trust me,
right?ELSAIt depends.JOJOWell, what if I told you I found a way
to escape Nazi Germany?ELSAWhat do you mean?JOJOI've found a way for you to be free.ELSAYes, me too. I'm going to kill myself.JOJOExactly. Wait. No! Not that!ELSAJojo, there's no point in going on.
There is no place for me anymore.JOJOLook, it's like Nathan said in my fake
letter from him. There are still Nazi-
free places. I can make it happen, I
know a secret way out.(MORE)109.JOJO (CONT'D)But you have to trust me and we can't
          delay. Get your things together, we
          leave in an hour.ELSAWhy don't we wait till night?JOJOAre you crazy? Night is when they
          expect us to make a move. Look, I
          don't try and tell you how to do art
          or poems, do I? No. So please leave
          the escape plans up to me. We'll be
          fine. The key is to blend in.

Elsa picks up the sandwich and takes a bite.ELSAYou think the suit helps?

Jojo looks at himself. It is pretty ridiculous.INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - JOJO'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATERJojo is now dressed in his normal clothes. He checks himself out
in the mirror and tucks in his shirt. Adolf Hitler is standing
behind him.ADOLF (O.S.)I'm not sure what's going on with us.
          I mean, what you're doing right now,
          I'm not comfortable with it.JOJOI don't think we should hang out
          anymore.ADOLFOkayyy, that was out of the blue.JOJOI can't be your friend anymore.ADOLFWow, don't hold back.

Adolf lights a cigarette. Offers Jojo a drag. Jojo takes the
cigarette and throws it in the opposite direction.ADOLF (CONT'D)Very mature.

He lights another.110.ADOLF (CONT'D)I gotta say, I'm pretty disappointed.JOJOYou lied to me. You lied to everyone
and then you blew your brains out.ADOLF(cocky)
Brains are very overrated my friend.JOJOYou ran away. You're a coward.ADOLFThat's a big accusation young man.
Blowing your brains out is actually a
pretty gutsy thing to do. I'd like to
see you try it.JOJOI wouldn't. And would you mind
explaining the constipation camps?ADOLFConstellation camps. We encourage
people to Stargaze.JOJOLiar.ADOLFOkay, okay, I get it, you   wanna go
your own way, maybe start   a Fourth
Reich or something. Fine.   But you know
what, you let me down too   so now we're
even.JOJOEven?! How? I believed in you!ADOLFYeah well, you stopped believing.
What's more you missed my birthday
which was just last week and you ended
up making friends with that thing
upstairs.JOJOThat thing is a little girl.ADOLFSays who?111.JOJOSays anyone who's ever met a little
          girl before!ADOLFWell excuse me for not knowing any
          little girls.
              (then)
          You're in love with her, aren't you!JOJOYes, I am.ADOLFAdmit it!JOJOI said yes.ADOLFI knew it. Well, she's too old for
          you. You don't stand a chance.JOJOIf I were bigger and more agile I'd
          kick your damn head off.

Adolf steps backwards, wary, a little scared.ADOLFOkay look, I'm sorry things didn't
          work out with us. But y'know, we're
          more alike than you think. I'm still
          quite proud of you. Intensely
          disappointed but also proud.
              (then)
          I now like to think of you as my
          strange, wayward, ugly son.JOJOI'm not your son. I've already got a
          dad and he's coming home.

He shakes one of his mother's letters in Adolf's face.ADOLF(hopeful)
          What about having two dads?JOJOI just want the one!

Adolf nods, he knows it's over.112.ADOLFGood luck little Jojo Rabbit. I'll see
             you round the traps.
                 (then)
             Before I go, could I give you a little
             bit of advice?

Jojo stares at him for a moment.JOJONo. Fuck off, Hitler.

Hitler nods knowingly, as if they are sharing a really deep and
important moment of exquisite understanding... yet obviously
hiding his disappointment. He WINKS at Jojo and saunters off.

Jojo TEARS DOWN the pictures of Hitler from his wall.INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - DAYJojo leads Elsa along the hall. Her hair is washed, she wears
clean clothes and holds Inga's papers. They head down the
stairs. Elsa catches a glimpse into Jojo's room and sees all of
her drawings on his wall. She hides a small smile and takes Jojo
by the hand.

He smiles, takes a breath and leads her carefully along the
hall, past the various rooms of the house. Pausing now and then
along the way, Jojo takes the time to savour his hand-holding
session with Elsa.

They reach the front door. Jojo looks down and notices
something. He bends down and does up Elsa's shoelaces. It is
slow-going but he succeeds. He stands.JOJO(whispering)
             Ready?

Elsa nods.ELSAIs it dangerous?

He smiles wide.JOJOExtremely.

Jojo WINKS a PERFECT WINK at Elsa, she takes a deep breath and
Jojo opens the door. Light fills the entrance to the house. They
step outside...113.EXT. JOJO'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUSJojo and Elsa stand on the front steps of the house. Elsa looks
at Jojo and then back out to the street. Yorki sits nearby, he
waves, smiling.

On the opposite corner we see a couple of British soldiers
crossing the road talking casually, in ENGLISH. An AMERICAN and
RUSSIAN FLAG can be seen hanging from a building in the
distance.

Realising what is going on, Elsa drops her bag. Jojo shuffles
his feet nervously. After a while, he does a small fist pump.JOJOYes...
              (then)
          We made it.

Long pause.
