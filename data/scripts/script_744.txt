    year-old risk assessment analyst. He has a Doctorate from MIT
    and is staring intently into a large bank of computer
    screens.

    An elevator door opens and FOUR HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE come
    out of the elevator carrying large file boxes. They walk down
    a long glass enclosed hallway that runs the full length of
    the trading floor. The scope of the floor now comes into
    frame. There are more computers than can be imagined and
    several large boards on the far walls that are scrolling
    thousands of numbers. PETER gives a knowing glance to the guy
    sitting next to him, SETH BREGMAN, a young analyst in his
    early twenties.SETHIs that them?PETER(nods yes)SETHJesus Christ.

    The HUMAN RESOURCES people turn and separate into a large
    glass walled conference room that runs along the floor as
    almost every person on the floor watches.

                        SETH (cont'd)
              Are they going to do it right there?PETERYeah.SETHFuck me.

    WILL EMERSON, sitting next to them, leans back in his chair.WILL EMERSON(whispered)
              Have you guys ever seen this before?SETHNo.WILL EMERSONBest to just ignore it. Keep your head
              down and get back to work... and don't
              watch.(CONTINUED)2.1   CONTINUED:                                                   1The HR people begin walking out onto the floor looking at a
    piece of paper in their hand then walking up behind a person
    and asking their name. It is brutal. The camera follows one
    HR woman, HEATHER, with her piece of paper down the hall and
    into a row of employees, she walks right past the THREE GUYS
    then stops a bit down from them.HEATHERTimothy Singh?TIMOTHYYes.HEATHERI'm afraid we have to speak with you.

    TIM gets up and walks back towards the conference room with
    the woman. PETER puts on his headphones and very loud RAP
    MUSIC drowns out all other noise and PETER tries to get lost
    back into the numbers on his computer screen.

    The sequence follows the HR people walking around and firing
    people intercut with PETER just staring at his computer
    screen. It runs for almost the length of the song until
    finally the same woman comes walking back down the hall and
    stops behind PETER and taps him on the shoulder. He takes off
    his headphones and the MUSIC STOPS. He is shell-shocked.

     BRATBERG, already sitting at the table. They all sit and look

    clear his things out into a file box. The guard stands at the

    Now just thirty-three are scattered throughout the vast
    mostly empty space. They all look up in silence at him. Long
    pause, then SAM'S face begins to glow a bit. His posture

    builds.SAM ROGERSYou are all still here for a reason...

    There are other people streaming out the door doing the same
    thing. ERIC stops, turns, and looks up at the building then
    tries to make a phone call but his phone does not work as it
    has been shut off by the firm. He looks up to the sky and
    can't believe his fate. As he looks down he sees a woman,

    in a well tailored power suit with her head down walking into

     around and sees no one, then inserts it into his computer. He
     has four large screens in front of him and as he begins
     opening window upon window of mathematical models his face
     begins to soften and he gets into his comfort zone. The frame

     a trash can. They follow SAM and WILL down a long hallway
     that is crowded with assistant cubicles. Eventually they turn
     into a small conference room that has no windows. It is
     claustrophobic.INT. JARED'S CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS31                                                                   31There are four people sitting at the table. They stand.
     Everyone says their somber hellos and shakes hands.ALL PRESENTSlight hellos, etc.

     They all sit down and at each place setting there is a pad of
     paper, a pencil, and an empty binder. Sitting at the head of
     the table is JARED COHEN. He is a blond boyish looking 43
     year old, although carries himself with intense confidence.
     He is the head of all fixed income securities, and oversees
     roughly 25,000 employees. Next to him is his chief risk
     management officer, SARAH ROBERTSON, the same woman from
     outside the building earlier who had the run in with ERIC.
     Next to her is her right hand man RAMESH SHAH, a sixty year
     old number cruncher and next to him is a firm lawyer. They
     are all dressed sharply for a new day. Long silence.SETH COUGHS.ALL PRESENT look down at him.JARED COHENSo Sam, what do you have for us?(CONTINUED)31.31   CONTINUED:                                                       31SAM ROGERSWell... it should be here in a minute.
                  Finding someone in the copy room at this
                  hour was a little bit of a challenge.JARED COHENWell why don't we start by introducing
                  everyone then.SAM ROGERSOK.JARED COHENThis is Sarah Robertson who you know, our
                  chief risk management officer, Ramesh
                  Shah from upstairs, and David Horn one of
                  the firm's in house counsel.SAM ROGERSNice to meet you all. This is Will
                  Emerson my head of trading, and this
                  is...WILL EMERSONPeter Sullivan, and Seth Bregman. They
                  work in our risk department.JARED COHENWhere is Eric Dale?SAM ROGERSHe was let go today.

     JARED COHEN looks at SARAH ROBERTSON as it would have been
     her call to let ERIC go, she nods yes.JARED COHENSo who's left in your risk department?WILL EMERSONAs of today that would be Peter and our
                  junior analyst Seth...?

     Everyone looks down the table at PETER and SETH. Their
     inexperience glares back.JARED COHENReally?

     JARED looks back at SARAH, then the room goes silent again.
     Finally a COPY ROOM STAFFER knocks on the door.COPY ROOM GUYWill Emerson?(CONTINUED)32.31   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 31WILL EMERSONHere. Please just give one to everyone,
               thanks.

     The COPY ROOM GUY hands out the packets to everyone in the
     room.SAM ROGERSSo apparently Eric had been working on
               this for some time but was unable to
               finish it, as he was leaving the building
               today he gave the program to Peter here,
               and told him to see what he thought.
               Peter figured a few things out that Eric
               seemed to be missing and this is what
               came out.JARED COHENWhere is Eric Dale now?SAM ROGERSHe's been unreachable since he left the
               office.

     JARED COHEN and the others open up the printout in front of
     them and start reviewing. SAM, WILL, PETER, and SETH just sit
     in awkward silence staring at the other side of the table as
     they all read. This goes on for a full very long minute.
     Finally:SARAH ROBERTSONPeter this is your work?PETERMainly Mr. Dale's...SARAH ROBERTSONBut this draft is yours?PETERYes. Again, derived from Mr. Dale's

               working with Eric that whole time... But
               I hold a doctorate in engineering,
               specialist in propulsion, from MIT, with
               a Bachelors from Penn.JARED COHENWhat's a specialty in propulsion?PETERWell... in laymen terms my thesis was a
               study in the way that friction ratios
               effect steering outcomes in aeronautical
               use under reduced gravity loads.

     Long silence.JARED COHENSo you are a rocket scientist?

     The whole table looks over at Peter with some awe.PETERUm... I was... yes.JARED COHENHow did you end up here?PETERWell it's all just numbers really, you're
               just changing what you're adding up...
               and if I may speak freely the money is
               considerably more attractive here.

     JARED looks down again at the numbers in front of him and his
     tone suddenly switches to serious, testy even.JARED COHENWhat time is it?RAMESHIt's 2:15.

     SAM and JARED just look at each other in silence for a bit.JARED COHENWhat do you have in exposure right now,

     RAMESH looks down at the sheet in front of him to go through
     the numbers and takes a beat too long.PETER1.215 Trillion.

     RAMESH checks his number.RAMESHYes.JARED COHENFuck me... fuck me... And I'm guessing by
               the fact that you two haven't said
               anything that the math checks out?

     JARED looks over at SARAH and RAMESH. SARAH then looks to
     RAMESH. She looks back.SARAH ROBERTSONLook    we'd need a little more time to go
               over    this, but Mr. Sullivan here seems to
               know    what he's doing. And I don't have to
               tell    you that this is a problem.JARED COHENThank you for that. What time is it?RAMESH2:16.JARED COHENFuck me!

     Jared stands up and walks around the small room. The rest of

               business is selling AND buying. It
               doesn't work for very long without both
               components. If we suddenly stop buying
               for a day or two that just doesn't hide
               under the rug, it gets out and this whole
               this thing comes to a end... and right
               quick.JARED COHENI understand.SAM ROGERSDo you?JARED COHENHow many traders do we have left between
               your floor and Petersen's?SAM ROGERSI don't know, sixty.

     RAMESH has been looking down at the numbers while this
     conversation has been taking place.RAMESHJared I've just been looking here a
               little closer, and it's these VAR numbers
               that are really setting this thing off.

     JARED holds up a hand to interrupt Ramesh. Jared nods his
     head, his eyes are perfectly still but his brain is racing.JARED COHENExcuse me, I need to make a quick call.

     JARED calmly stands up   and steps out of the   room for a long
     moment. The room stays   completely quiet the   whole time he is
     gone. We hear nothing.   It is awkward to say   the least. He
     comes back in and sits   down without missing   a beat.

               that might be left on the books, if they
               had to be?SARAH ROBERTSONWhy would they still be on the books?SAM ROGERSBecause suddenly no one wants to buy
               them.JARED COHENOh fuck you Sam... give me a fucking
               break, all at once?SARAH ROBERTSONWithout an active market, it could take
               weeks, months for me to value them

     not tall, late fifties and doesn't have a hair on his head.

     PETER is very nervous.PETERWell, sir. As I guess you may or may not
               know I work for Mr. Rogers here as an
               associate in the risk assessment and
               management office at MBSJOHN TULDNow you lost me at M...PETERSorry...JOHN TULDI was joking Mr. Sullivan.PETERYes... Well as you probably know over the
               last 36-40 months the firm has begun
               packaging new MBS products that combine
               several different traunches of rating
               classification in one tradable security.
               This has been very profitable as I
               imagine you noticed.JOHN TULDI have.PETERWell the firm is currently doing a
               considerable amount of this business
               every day. The problem, which is I guess
               why we are here tonight, is that it takes
               us... the firm... almost a month to layer
               these products correctly thereby posing a
               challenge from a risk management
               standpoint.JOHN TULDAnd Mr. Sullivan that challenge is?PETERWe have to hold these assets on our books
               longer than we might ideally like to.(CONTINUED)50.45   CONTINUED: (3)                                                45JOHN TULDYes.PETERBut the key factor is these are
               essentially just mortgages, so that has
               allowed us to push the leverage
               considerably beyond what you might be
               willing, or allowed to do in any other
               circumstance, thereby pushing the risk
               profile without raising any red flags.JOHN TULDAnd how far have we pushed that profile
               tonight Mr. Sullivan?PETERWe have pushed it to 1.215 Trillion
               dollars... at MBS alone.JOHN TULDGive or take.PETERGive or take.JOHN TULDNow Mr. Sullivan what I am guessing, and
               give me a little rope here, what I am
               guessing that your report here says is
               that considering the, shall we say bumpy
               road, we've been on the last week or so
               that the numbers that your brilliant co-
               workers up the line ahead of you had come
               up with in the past don't seem to make
               much sense anymore considering what's
               taking place today?PETERActually not taking place today but
               what's already taken place over the last
               two weeks.JOHN TULDSo what you're saying is it's already
               happened?PETERSort of.JOHN TULDAnd Mr. Sullivan what does your model say

               projection. But...

     PETER looks down at JARED for approval to go forward.JOHN TULDYou're speaking with me Mr. Sullivan.PETERWell... sir... if those assets were to
               decrease by just 25 percent, and remain
               on our books... well... that loss would
               be greater than the current market
               capitalization of this company.

     The room goes silent. JOHN TULD looks at PETER long and hard.
     He then stands up and goes over to the window and looks into
     the city.JOHN TULDSo what you're telling me Mr. Sullivan is
               that the music appears to be about to
               stop and we are going to be holding the
               biggest bag of stinking shit ever

               way but let me clarify using your
               analogy, what this model shows is the
               music, so to speak, just slowing, if the
               music were to stop, as you put it, then
               this model would not be even close to

               I'm here to guess what the music is gonna

                  I have spent the night here meeting with
                  the executive committee and the decision
                  has been made to begin to unwind a
                  considerable portion of the firm's
                  holdings in several key asset classes.
                  The crux of it is... in the firm's
                  thinking the party is over as of this
                  morning. There is going to be
                  considerable turmoil in the markets for
                  the foreseeable future. They believe that
                  it is better to have this turmoil begin
                  with us... as a result the firm has
                  decided to liquidate the majority of its
                  position of fixed income MBS today.

                  expressed this reality to the executive
                  committee and they understand. As a
                  result, if you are able to complete a 93%

               For those of you who have never been
               through this before, this is what the
               beginning of a fire sale looks like. I
               don't have to tell any of you that the
               first hour and a half is going to be very
               important. I want you to hit every bite

               obviously no swaps, its outgoing only
               today. This is obviously not the way any
               of us would like for this to be going
               down, but the ground is shifting below
               our feet, and there appears to be no
               other way out.

     that they indeed know what needs to be done.

               we will have been successful in
               destroying our own jobs... I can not
               promise that each of you will be
               repositioned within the firm, but I can
               tell you that I am very proud of the work
               we have done together here, I have been
               at this here for 34 years, and I know...
               from experience people are going to say
               some nasty stuff about what we have done
               here, and what you have devoted a portion
