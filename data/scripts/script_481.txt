Ghost World"GHOST WORLD"byDANIEL CLOWESandTERRY ZWIGOFFOPENING TITLE SEQUENCE - EVENINGWe MOVE through the city in a series of brief shots that 
               define and establish our setting, from commercial district 
               to residential neighborhood. Eventually we find ourselves 
               moving down a street of two-story apartment buildings. Many 
               of the windows are lit from within by an EERIE BLUE LIGHT. 
               As we track past at window-level we see:

               A glum, sedated-looking COUPLE watching TV. An ignored TODDLER 
               runs amok behind them as a cheery commercial plays..

               An empty room...

               A large, hirsute MAN, wearing only Lycra jogging shorts, 
               watching the Home Shopping Network while eating mashed 
               potatoes with his fingers...

               A dazed old woman staring out the window.

               The silhouette of a TEENAGE GIRL dancing by herself.

               We enter her room and see the TV SCREEN. The source of the 
               THEME MUSIC is A VIDEO of an insane East Indian production 
               number from the 1960's. The room is cluttered with heaps of 
               clothes, old records, odd knick-knacks. We see her silhouetted 
               back as she dances along to the video while trying on aGRADUATION CAP AND GOWN.EXT. HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION - AFTERNOON NEXT DAY.A modern high school auditorium. Over the entrance a banner 
               with a "Coca Cola" logo reads: "GRADUATION TODAY 2 PM."INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - SAME DAYA graduation ceremony is in progress. We DOLLY PAST the bland 
               faces of teary-eyed graduates until we stop on ENID. At first, 
               we only see the top of her mortarboard; as she lifts her 
               head we see that she's trying desperately not to laugh.

               She makes eye-contact with REBECCA, another graduate, who is 
               also trying to stifle her laughter. The SPEAKER is in an 
               elaborate wheelchair with severe-looking traction devices.SPEAKERHigh school is like the training 
                         wheels for the bicycle of real life.  
                         It is a time for young people to 
                         explore different fields of interest 
                         and to hopefully grow from their 
                         experiences.  After all, that which 
                         we learn from our mistakes can be as 
                         valuable as what we learn from our 
                         textbooks, and often we can turn the 
                         negative experiences that are common 
                         to all high-schoolers into positive 
                         steps toward personal growth and 
                         achievement. In coming to terms with 
                         my own personal setback, which I'm 
                         sure you've all heard about, I've 
                         been able to learn a lot about myself. 
                         I've learned for one thing that I 
                         don't need to rely on drugs and 
                         alcohol(APPLAUSE)and that I'm very lucky-that more 
                         people besides Carrie and myself 
                         weren't hurt in the accident; I've 
                         learned that I'm blessed with 
                         wonderful parents, teachers and above

               bursting with excitement over their long-awaited release.

               Enid stops and looks back at the school. She gives it THE

                         background is in video and performance

                         internal. At the end of the Summer, 
                         this class has been invited, along 
                         with several others in the area, to 
                         participate in a show of High-School 
                         art at the Neighborhood Activity

                         be "Brotherhood and Community: Art 
                         as Dialogue." I think the 
                         "Brotherhood" theme ties in nicely 
                         with the theme of self-discovery

               bedroom and mechanically turns on her boom box. The punk 
               rock song we heard earlier plays. She yanks out the tape and 
               flings it away. She skims through her records and CDs, 
               dismissing them all. She notices Seymour's bag in the corner.

               She takes out the record and puts it on. The first tune is 
               an upbeat instrumental number. She returns to the bathroom.

               Several minutes pass. TRACK TWO begins on the LP. She (and 
               we) slowly begin to take notice. It's a strange, haunting 
               old BLUES RECORD. We see that the tune has struck a nerve.INT. ENID'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHTThe song continues. Enid sits in her bean-bag chair. Her

                         Why did you say she might be hiding 
                         from me? Did she say anything to you 
                         about me?REBECCA(getting revenge on 
                              Seymour)
                         Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.SEYMOURDid she say that?REBECCALook, what do you expect?  Considering 
                         how we met you.SEYMOURWhat do you mean?REBECCAOn that pathetic fake blind date.SEYMOURWhat are you talking about?REBECCADidn't she ever tell you about that?

                         talking about?

               Rebecca goes over and gets Enid's sketchbook out of the box 
               and flips through it. When she gets to the right page she 
               hands it to Seymour.REBECCAHere. Read it and weep.

               We see a pasted-up PERSONAL AD beside a DRAWING OF SEYMOUR 
               in Wowsville. On the facing page we see a drawing of JOSH 
               with his name surrounded by RED HEARTS.EXT. SIDEWINDER - AFTERNOONSeymour's car screeches into the parking lot. He bursts into 
               the store, ready for once in his life to make a scene.INT. SIDEWINDER - AFTERNOONJosh is behind the counter cleaning the Slurpee machine, 
               with his back to the entrance, as Seymour storms in. Doug is 
               over by the magazine rack reading a dirt bike magazine.SEYMOURI hope you had a good laugh at my 
                         expense.

               Josh turns around - what's going on? He recognizes Seymour.JOSHHuh... oh... hi... uh...SEYMOURYou want to see something funny?  
                         I'll show you something funny!

               As he says this he flips over a SMALL DISPLAY RACK of potato 
               chips. Then he tries to flip over a BIG DISPLAY CASE in front 
               of the counter but is unable to budge it - he keeps trying 
               and gets more and more frustrated.JOSHHEY!Josh runs from behind the counter to stop him before he 
               creates a huge mess. He tries to grab Seymour and they get 
               into a ridiculous frantic scuffle. Seymour starts yelling.  
               Suddenly Doug appears and gets Seymour in a choke hold with 
               his nunchucks. Doug ad-libs cop-style jargon. Josh is freaked 
               out. Seymour realizes what a fool he is and starts to cry.

               The Boss comes out of the back room...BOSSJosh! What going on here?!INT. ENID & REBECCA'S APARTMENT - AROUND MIDNIGHTThe apartment is dark - lit only by a harsh, annoying 
               streetlight. Rebecca sits on the couch in sweat clothes, 
               exasperated. She goes to look out the window. Cars with loud 
               radios can be heard driving by. She goes to the phone - she 
               checks it and hangs up. Pause. She picks it up again - one 
               last try. She dials the number and waits. We hear the BEEP 
               of the answering machine. Rebecca hangs up.

               She gets into a sleeping bag (spread out in the center of a 
               cold linoleum floor). She zips the zipper all the way over 
               her head and curls up into a whimpering ball.FADE TO BLACKTITLE CARD: "SEVERAL MONTHS LATER"INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAYThe dialogue begins in voice-over as the title card fades. 
               We slowly fade in to see Seymour, lying on a pink pastel 
               psychiatrist's couch, as he speaks to his THERAPIST, a 
               handsome, well-coiffed woman in her late 40s.SEYMOURI have to admit, things have really 
                         started looking up for me since my 
                         life turned to shit.THERAPISTSo tell me more about this job.  
                         What exactly will you be doing?SEYMOURWell, mostly archival research, 
                         cataloguing old records and writing 
                         liner notes for their CD reissues.  
                         It's really... I can't believe it.THERAPISTRemember what I said when we first 
                         started -- this little breakdown 
                         might turn out to be the best thing 
                         that ever happened to you!SEYMOURIt doesn't pay very much, but I should 
                         be able to afford my own place in a 
                         few months... Do you think that's 
                         too soon? I'm really anxious to get 
                         my record collection out of storage...THERAPISTWhy don't we start with that next 
                         week?

               Seymour looks up. She nods toward the large wall clock behind 
               her: thirty seconds after five. Re gets up and she walks him 
               slowly toward the door.SEYMOURThank you, doctor.THERAPIST(as she opens the 
                              door)
                         Don't thank me. You're doing all the 
                         work.

               A pause. They stand facing each other.THERAPISTSeymour?SEYMOURYes?THERAPISTDo you have a check for me?

               Seymour takes a filled-out check from his shirt pocket. In 
               the waiting room, we see SEYMOUR'S MOTHER.MOTHERSeymour? Are you done? Did you have 
                         a chance to think about what you 
                         might want for dinner while you were 
                         in there?SEYMOURWe can talk about it in the car, 
                         Ma...

               As they leave Seymour looks back and smiles weakly at the 
               doctor.INT. QUALITY CAFE - LATE AFTERNOONThe Cafe has been FULLY REMODELED and now resembles Wowsville 
               more than the old Quality Cafe. There are no neighborhood 
               "characters" anymore, only well-heeled twenty-somethings. We 
               see that Rebecca is now a waitress here. She tears off a 
               check and places it in front of a super-muscular, polo shirted 
               EUROPEAN HIPSTER, who is too busy tapping away at his 
               POWERBOOK to notice.

               She walks toward the end of the counter to total up her 
               receipts. She looks up and sees Enid, wearing tasteful 1930's 
               style clothes, sitting across from her.ENIDHi.REBECCAOh, hi... I almost didn't recognize 
                         you -- I think I need to get glasses; 
                         you're all blurry!ENID(nodding toward 
                              muscular HIPSTER)
                         You're lucky then, you can't see the 
                         veins on that guy's biceps.REBECCAActually, he's a really nice guy.

               We see at this point that Rebecca & Enid are no longer 
               friends, but there are also no hard feelings evident.REBECCADo you want anything?ENIDMaybe an orange juice.

               Rebecca goes to get it. Enid looks around, bemused and 
               saddened by what The Quality Cafe has become.ENIDHey, look what I got...

               She takes a crumpled envelope from her pocket and pulls out 
               her DIPLOMA.REBECCAWow... finally.ENIDIt just came yesterday...

               Pause. Josh enters. Enid turns around.JOSHHi Enid.ENIDHey Josh.JOSHAre you ready to go?

               For a moment it's not clear who he's talking to, and then:REBECCA(still counting 
                              receipts)
                         Yeah, just one second...

               She finishes, takes off her apron and emerges from behind 
               the counter. She kisses Josh perfunctorily.REBECCA(to Josh)
                         Did you remember to pay the phone 
                         bill?JOSHYeah.REBECCA(to Enid)
                         Call me sometime.ENIDDefinitely. We still have to go to 
                         that shoe store sometime.

               Rebecca & Josh leave. Enid is totally alone in the now-alien 
               world of the Quality Cafe. A momentary pause as she calmly 
               stares into her orange juice. We see a small, round TRAVEL 
               BAG at her feet.EXT. CITY STREETS/ACME SHOES - EVENINGWe see Enid walking down the familiar streets of her world.

               It's early evening, quiet except for distant street noises.

               She walks toward the old ACME SHOES AND REPAIR STORE. It 
               looks the same, miraculously preserved, until she stands 
               right in front of it. She looks through the partially papered 
               over window and sees WORKMEN inside installing new fixtures: 
               a modern counter and several small tables, all made from a 
               FAMILIAR GREEN PLASTIC. A sign in the window reads: "Coming 
               Soon: Another COFFEE EXPERIENCE.EXT. CITY STREET - EVENINGShe continues walking as the sun has set and there is a calm 
               stillness to the city. She turns a corner and is startled by 
               her reflection in a large window made of one-way glass. She 
               stops and looks at herself. Everything about her looks perfect 
               for once; no need to change a thing. She moves closer to the 
               glass and, shading her eyes, tries to look inside.

               She continues walking. Darkness is just setting in and she 
               has the street all to herself.EXT. COMMERCIAL AREA/BUS STOP - NIGHTWe see Enid at NORMAN'S BUS STOP, sitting on the bench. She 
               looks at the apartment building across the street. A woman 
               who has just arrived home from work turns on the TV, bathing 
               her living room with that EERIE BLUE LIGHT. The same thing 
               happens in another window down the street... then another...  
               Enid looks down the street. In the distance A BUS rounds the 
               corner and heads toward her.

               From a third-story window across the street, we see the bus 
               as it arrives and stops, blocking Enid from view. A moment 
               later it pulls away, leaving an empty bench. The CAMERA moves 
               upward, farther and farther away as the music swells and the 
               credits roll.EXT. BRIDGE - EVENINGThe bus disappears over the crest of the bridge.THE END
