            change for you.CUT TO:M.C.S. JACKJACKWell, I'm looking for a change.ULLMAN (OFF)Our people in Denver recommended
            Jack very highly, and, for once, I
            agree with them.CUT TO:M.S. ULLMAN7.ULLMANLet's see, where were we?  Yes.  I
            was about to explain that eh... our
            season here runs from oh May 15th
            to October 30th and then we close
            down completely until the following
            May.CUT TO:M.C.S. JACKJACKDo you mind if I ask why you do
            that?  It seems to me that the
            skiing up here would be fantastic.ULLMAN (OFF)Oh, it sure would beCUT TO:M.S. ULLMANULLMAN (CONT'D)but the problem is the enormous
            cost it would be to keep the road
            to the Sidewinder open.  It's a...
            It's a 25 mile stretch of road -
            gets an average of 20 feet of snow
            during the winter, and there's just
            no way to make it economically
            feasible to keep it clear.  When
            the place was built in 1907, there
            was very little interest in winter
            sports, and this site was chosen
            for its seclusion and scenic beauty.CUT TO:M.L.S. ULLMAN over WATSON & JACK.JACKWell, it's certainly got plenty of
            that.

JACK laughs.ULLMANThat's right.  And did they give
            you any idea in Denver about what
            the job entails?8.JACKOnly in a very general way.ULLMANWell...CUT TO:M.S. ULLMANULLMAN (CONT'D)...the winters can be fantastically
            cruel, and the basic idea is
            to...to cope with the very costly
            damage and depreciation which can
            occur.  And this consists mainly of
            running the boiler, heating
            different parts of the hotel on a
            daily rotating basis, repairing
            damage as it occurs and doing
            repairs, so that the elements can't
            get a foothold.CUT TO:M.C.S. JACKJACKWell, that sounds fine to me.

ULLMAN grunts off.CUT TO:M.S. ULLMANULLMANPhysically, it's not a very
            demanding job.  The only thing that
            can get a bit trying up here during
            the winter is eh... the tremendous
            sense of isolation.CUT TO:M.C.S. JACKJACKWell, that just happens to be
            exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm
            eh... I'm outlining a new writing
            project, and eh...(MORE)9.JACK (CONT'D)five months of peace is just what I
            want.CUT TO:M.S. ULLMANULLMANThat's very good Jack, because eh...
            for some people eh solitude and
            isolation...CUT TO:M.C.S. JACK.ULLMAN (OFF) (CONT'D)can of itself be a problem.JACKNot for me.CUT TO:M.S. ULLMAN.ULLMANHow about your wife and son?  How
            do you think they'll take to it?CUT TO:M.C.S. JACK.JACKThey'll love it.ULLMAN (OFF)Great...CUT TO:M.S. ULLMANULLMANWell, before I turn you over to
            Bill, there is one other thing I
            think we should talk about.  I
            don't want to sound melodramatic,
            but it is something that's...(MORE)10.ULLMAN (CONT'D)been known to give a few people
            second thoughts about the job.CUT TO:M.C.S. JACKJACKI'm intrigued.CUT TO:M.S. ULLMAN.ULLMANI don't suppose they eh told you
            anything in Denver about the
            tragedy we had up here during the
            winter of 1970?CUT TO:M.C.S. JACK shakes his head.JACKI don't believe they did.CUT TO:M.S. BILL WATSON.ULLMAN (OFF)Well, my predecessor in this jobCUT TO:M.S. ULLMAN.ULLMAN (CONT'D)hired a man named Charles Grady, as
            the winter caretaker.  He came up
            here with his wife and two little
            girls of about eight or ten.  And
            he had a good employment record,
            good references and from what I've
            been told, I mean, he seemed like a
            completely normal individual.  But
            at some point during the winter, he
            must have suffered some kind of a
            complete mental breakdown.(MORE)11.ULLMAN (CONT'D)He ran amok and eh... killed his
            family with an axe,CUT TO:M.C.S. JACKULLMAN (OFF) (CONT'D)stacked them neatly in one of the
            rooms in the West Wing, and then he
            um... then he put eh both barrels
            of his shotgun in his mouth.CUT TO:M.S. ULLMAN sitting behind desk.ULLMAN (CONT'D)The police eh... they thought that
            it was what the old-timers used to
            call cabin-fever, a kind of
            claustrophobic reaction which can
            occur when people areCUT TO:M.C.S. JACKULLMAN (OFF) (CONT'D)shut in together over long periods
            of time.JACKWell, that is eh quite a story.CUT TO:M.S. ULLMAN laughs.ULLMANYes, it is.  Oh, it's still hard
            for me to believe that it actually
            happened here, but it did and eh...
            I think you can appreciate why I
            wanted to tell you about it.CUT TO:M.C.S. JACK.12.JACKAh, I certainly can, and eh... I
            also understand why your people in
            Denver left it for you to tell me.

            alone in a place where something
            like that actually happened.JACKWell, you can rest assured Mr.
            Ullman, that's not going to happen
            with me, and eg as far as my wife
            is concerned, I am sure she'll be
            absolutely fascinated when I tell
