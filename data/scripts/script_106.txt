          chanting Magbar Carter! Magbar Ahmrika!� Fists in the
          air.SUPERIMPOSE: TEHRAN - NOVEMBER 4, 1979YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN -- about 2/3 men and 1/3 women, some
          with flak jackets; about half the young women wear full
          chador. Many wear plastic bibs with photographs of
          Ayatollah Khomeini.
          PASTED TO ROOSEVELT GATE: photographs of STUDENTS who
          were killed under the deposed Shah of Iran's regime.
          Signs in English: U.S.A. RETURN THE SHAH� -- JUSTICE
          FOR MURDER.� A few IRANIAN POLICE attend -- more as
          bystanders than peacekeepers.
          A MAN frantically stabs an EFFIGY of the SHAH.
          An IRANIAN STUDENT films the scene with a Super 8 camera.2 EXT. EMBASSY GROUNDS - MORNING 2From INSIDE THE EMBASSY GATES we can hear the noise of
          the protest. There are three primary buildings on
          campus: the CHANCERY, the embassy's main building, THE
          AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, and the CONSULATE.
          We can see that the compound is securitized: sand-filled
          traps and steel bars on the windows of the consulate.3 INT. U.S. EMBASSY - CONSULATE OFFICE - MORNING 3Now, we see the POV THROUGH those steel bars.
          Standing on a chair looking at the protest outside the
          gate, is BOB ANDERS, late 40s-50s, a consular officer.(CONTINUED)ARGO - Final 2.3 CONTINUED: 3BOB ANDERSCarnival's bigger today.

          window.4 EXT. ROOSEVELT GATE - MORNING 4Then, in a famous piece of archive footage, something
          simple happens. A YOUNG MAN IN A SWEATER climbs the gate
          and makes it to the other side.
          And now, we see the REVERSE of that famous shot. This
          isn't archive footage anymore.
          We're looking at the POV of TOM AHERN, 48, the CIA
          station chief here.5 INT. MARINE GUARD POST - MORNING 5From a pillbox on the embassy campus, SGT. ROCKY

          A group of STUDENTS -- these more brisk, organized, all
          bearded and dressed in flak jackets -- push their way to
          the front of the protest --
          WOMEN raise a banner. It's a signal.
          As if on cue, the IRANIAN POLICE move from the gates. A
          WOMAN removes a large pair of bolt cutters from
          underneath her chador -- hands them to a BEARDED STUDENT
          -- who gets to work on the CHAINS holding the gateCLOSED --When one YOUNG MAN wearing a green military field jacket
          raises his fist, we can see that he has a concealed
          PISTOL in his clothes.
          More STUDENTS climbing the wall -- dropping the 12 feet
          to the other side, one after another.
