                       Roselyne BoschREVISEDSeptember 23, 1991FADE IN:CREDITS AND MUSIC OVER:INT.  AUDIENCE ROOM - GRANADA - DAYWe start on a man's elegant slipper.  He is seated in a
	splendid chair.  Moving up the stocking leg, we pass the
	garter of Castile, coming to rest on a pair of delicate
	hands.  His fore finger impatiently plays with a large
	topaz ring.  Over this, we hear distant footsteps, echoing
	on marble floors.CUT TO:A Castilian face:  aquilaine profile, olive complexion,
	dark eyebrows and meticulously sculpted beard.  This isTREASURER SANCHEZ.A door slams somewhere, the footsteps getting closer.  We
	can now here a subdued conversation.

	TREASURER SANCHEZ stands up as:

	The door opens at the far end of the large gilded room.
	A WOMEN, magnificent in somber taffeta, enters.  QUEEN
	ISABEL OF SPAIN moves towards him.

	He bows slightly as she sits at the end of the large
	table.  She is followed by a PRIEST, BROTHER BUYL, and
	three dignitaries of Church and State.

	All sit beside her.  TREASURER SANCHEZ takes a document
	and starts to read aloud.

	On screen the words:  GRANADA - SPAIN - 1500SANCHEZYour Majesty would wish to know the
			true facts concerning the island of
			Hispanola, our first settlement in
			the New World, and the activities
			there of your servant, Christopher
			Columbus, Admiral of the Ocean Sea,
			Governor of that Island.  You will
			remember with what hopes and
			promises he beguiled us -- the truth
			is that he now presides over a state
			of chaos, degradation and madness
			beyond imagining.

	SANCHEZ punctuates each word carefully.SANCHEZFrom the beginning, Columbus proved
			himself incapable of managing the
			affairs of the island.  He appointed
			his brothers to important positions,
			at once injuring the pride and
			dignity of the nobles who had gone
			with him.  He promised to build a
			city, the City of Isabel, named
			after Your Majesty.  What he
			actually built was nothing but a
			collection of huts, and that in the
			wrong place, for all of it was
			easily swept away by rain and mud.
			Is that not so, Brother Buyl?

	The PRIEST nods.BROTHER BUYLYes, Your Honor.SANCHEZHe promised gold.  Not finding the
			easy quantities he promised,
			Columbus commanded each Indian to
			pay an annual tribute.  Most being
			unable to, they were barbarously
			punished, against the express wish
			of Your Christian Majesties...

	ISABEL lowers her eyes.SANCHEZSince provocation and injustice
			never ceases, many of the Indians
			have fled to the forests, or have
			begun to slay the Christians.

	ISABEL looks over at BROTHER BUYL.ISABELCould it be so?BROTHER BUYLYes, Your Majesty.SANCHEZBut there is worse.  From the
			beginning, he forced the nobles to
			undergo physical labor, treating
			them equally with the Indians, all
			of them reduced to slavery.  When
			the nobleman Adrian de Moxica
			protested against such treatment...
				(he pauses)
			... he was executed.
				(pause)
			Is that not true also, Brother
			Buyl?BROTHER BUYLYes, Your Honor.  It is all true.
			All of it.  I saw it with my own
			eyes.SANCHEZHe has lost control.  His great
			arrogance has led him into
			depravity.  He encourages our
			soldiers to marry the native women.
			He promised a paradise, but he has
			made a hell full of all its horrors.

	Silence.ISABELIs that the man I knew, Treasurer
			Sanchez?SANCHEZYes, Your Majesty.CUT TO:INT.  HUT - ISLAND - DAYCLOSE ON the FACE:  COLUMBUS is stretched on a bed,
	sweating heavily in fever, clearly delirious.  Insects
	crawl over his face, he makes no effort to swat them away.
	There is a dripping sound of water.FERNANDO (V.O.)Of all the words my Father wrote and
			there were many, I remember these
			the most.  "Nothing that results
			from human progress is achieved with
			unanimous consent..."

	Rain is falling into the room over documents spread on a
	table.  COLUMBUS stands up and moves to the table.  Some
	of the walls have been blackened with smoke and flames.  A
	lizard scuttles into the shadows.FERNANDO (V.O.)"And those who are enlightened
			before the others are condemned to
			purse that light in spite of
			others..."

	COLUMBUS stares down at the documents, moving them away
	from the rain drips.  He stares out by the window, and we
	see:

	A devastated landscape.  Flooded roads, half-destroyed
	huts, broken trees... A dog picks its way through the mud.FERNANDO (V.O.)There was a time when the New World
			didn't exist...DISSOLVE TO:EXT.  OCEAN - DAYA vast stretch of ocean.  It fills the screen.  Unbroken,
	infinite, luminous, mysterious -- it stretches away,
	meeting and blending with the sky in pale ribbons of pearl
	and misty light.FERNANDO (V.O.)... The sun set in the west on an
			ocean where no man had dared to
			venture.  And beyond that,
			infinity...

	Pulling back, we discover:

	A TEN-YEAR-OLD BOY and a strongly built man in his middle
	thirties, are riding a mule.  The MAN'S weather-beaten
	face frames unusually bright eyes.

	On the screen these words:  ANDALUSIA, 1491

	COLUMBUS AND HIS SON are following a windthrashed path at
	the top of the hill.  COLUMBUS hums a song, and FERNANDO
	looks up at him in adoration.FERNANDO (V.O.)Once I asked my Father where he
			wanted to go.  And he replied:  "I
			want to travel all over the seas.  I
			want to get behind the weather..."

	FERNANDO laughs.  He then starts to hum along with hisFATHER.CUT TO:EXT.  HILLSIDE APPROACH TO LA RABIDA - DAYA rugged landscape, remote and steep, with lines of stone
	walls and thousands of sheep.

	FERNANDO, rushes down a slope, barking like a dog, chasing
	the sheep who fan out in droves in front of him.  High-
	spirited and wild, FERNANDO laughs and tumbles over.

	COLUMBUS rides his mule along the narrow track, watching
	his SON'S antics with amusement.  In the distance, the
	solitary figure of A MONK SHEPHERD.

	COLUMBUS calls out to his son:COLUMBUSFernando!

	FERNANDO runs over.  COLUMBUS lifts him up onto the mule.

	As they move along the track we now see, perched on a
	distant hill, isolated and austere, the Monastery of La
	Rabida, their destination.EXT.  CLOISTER - LA RABIDA - DAYAs they dismount and walk into the quiet cloisters,
	FERNANDO suddenly spots a familiar FIGURE, standing under
	the ROMAN arches.FERNANDODiego!

	He rushes over, full of joy, to kiss his BROTHER -- an
	adolescent dressed in the novice-robe, with a solemn,
	delicate face.  DIEGO'S response is constrained.COLUMBUSDiego!  Aren't you going to kiss
			your brother?

	DIEGO smiles a little, and kisses FERNANDO -- who is
	immediately distracted by a procession of hooded MONKS,
	hurrying to the refectory, as a bell begins to chime.

	The MONKS all turn to greet ANTONIO DE MARCHENA, a white-
	haired, elderly man -- and a monk cosmographer.
	MARCHENA'S gesture is broad and elegant as he opens his
	arms to greet COLUMBUS.  He pats FERNANDO'S head and turns
	to DIEGO.MARCHENADiego, take Fernando to the dining
			hall.  He must be hungry.DIEGOYes, Father.

	Both CHILDREN leave under the arched roof.  COLUMBUS and
	MARCHENA begin to walk across the cloister.MARCHENADiego is a bright boy -- a pleasure
			to teach -- but so serious...
			Brothers should be raised together,
			Colon.  Even brothers from different
			mothers...COLUMBUSFather, I am doing what I think is
			the best for him.  And he has the
			teacher I would have chosen for
			myself.

	MARCHENA laughs at the compliment.MARCHENAJust be careful you don't lose him.

	They have crossed the cloister.  MARCHENA pushes open a
	door.INT.  A HUGE LIBRARY - LA RABIDA - DAYHundreds of books lined up on the shelves, displaying the
	miracle of printing, a recent German discovery.  Several
	MONKS, perched on high stools behind lecterns, are busily
	"ILLUMINATING" some of these massive volumes, delicately
	painting around the letters in bright colors and gold
	leaf.

	Rays of light fall diagonally through high openings,
	projecting geometric patterns on the tiled floor.  As
	MARCHENA and COLUMBUS move forward their conversation is
	punctuated by light and shadow.MARCHENA(fumbles in a pocket
				under his robe)
			I have something for you.

	Almost casually, he hands COLUMBUS a letter.MARCHENAYou will be heard at the University
			of Salamanca...

	COLUMBUS stops dead in his tracks.  Almost frantically he
	tears open the letter, hardly able to believe his eyes.COLUMBUSGod... That's in a week!MARCHENAThat's what it says.COLUMBUSHow did you manage it?MARCHENA(smiling)
			With some difficulty.  I had to
			promise them you were not a total
			fool.

	MARCHENA pushes open a second door, hidden behind a wooden
	panel.INT.  STUDY - LA RABIDA - DAYMARCHENA is not a tidy man.  Books are piled up on the
	floor, the desk, on every shelf, along with maps,
	instruments of astronomy... the visible evidence of an
	inquiring mind.

	With practiced familiarity, as if they had done this a
	hundred times -- which indeed they have -- MARCHENA sits
	behind his desk, and COLUMBUS opposite him.  MARCHENA
	lights a candle and considers the mess.  Then
	methodically, he slowly sweeps it from in front of him
	with his sleeve, exposing a large map underneath.

	When he looks up again, there is a new severity in his
	expression.  He turns over an hourglass.MARCHENAWhy do you wish to sail west?COLUMBUSTo open a new route to Asia.  At the
			moment there are only two ways of
			reaching it...

	He leans forward, and points to the map spread out on the
	desk.COLUMBUSBy sea, sailing around the African
			Continent -- the journey takes a
			year...

	His finger traces the journey, from west to east.COLUMBUSOr by land...

	We are CLOSE now on the map, as we watch his finger
	tracing a line between Europe and the Far East.COLUMBUS (O.S.)... But the Turks have closed this
			route to all Christians.  Trading
			with the Orient has become arduous,
			if not dangerous.
				(he pauses)
			There is a third way...

	We notice that the outline of the European continent is
	familiar.  But we also notice that, in that great expanse
	of ocean, the whole American continent is missing.COLUMBUSBy sailing West across the Ocean
			Sea.

	CLOSE ON MARCHENA'S FACE, touched by the mystery.MARCHENAHow can you be so certain?  The
			Ocean is said to be infinite.COLUMBUSIgnorance!  I believe the Indies are
			no more than 750 leagues west of the
			Canary Islands.MARCHENAHow can you be so certain?COLUMBUSThe calculations of Toscanelli Marin
			de Tyr, Esdras...MARCHENA(interrupting)
			Esdras is a Jew.COLUMBUSSo was Christ!

	MARCHENA throws his quill in the air in frustration.  He
	glances at the hourglass:MARCHENATwo minutes... and already you're a
			dead man.  Don't let passion
			overwhelm you, Colon.COLUMBUS(mockingly)
			I'll try to remember that,
			Marchena...MARCHENAFather Marchena!COLUMBUS(ignoring this)
			Passion is something one cannot
			control!MARCHENA(heatedly)
			You get so carried away when you are
			being contradicted!COLUMBUSI've been contradicted all my
			life... Eternity!MARCHENA(amused)
			Only God knows the meaning of such
			words, my son.EXT.  COURTYARD - LA RABIDA - EVENINGDIEGO and FERNANDO wait in the courtyard.  COLUMBUS
	appears and lifts FERNANDO onto the mule.  DIEGO turns to
	go.COLUMBUSDiego.

	COLUMBUS walks over to him, squats down so their eyes
	meet.  He looks at his SON for a moment.COLUMBUSWould you like to come and stay with
			us?

	Uncomfortable with the proposition, DIEGO cannot find an
	answer.COLUMBUSI'll do whatever makes you happy.DIEGOI am happy, Father.

	COLUMBUS reaches out -- and touches his shoulder.

	He climbs up behind FERNANDO, who waves back to his
	BROTHER as they ride off.EXT.  CADIZ - STREETS AND CATHEDRAL SQUARE - NIGHTCOLUMBUS leads the mule, carrying the sleeping FERNANDO,
	through narrow streets.  There's a clamorous noise in the
	air.  Suddenly a large group of YOUNG MEN, shouting with
	excitement, run up the street and brush past them.  Then
	more people.  FERNANDO sits up straight.  The noise grows,
	rowdy, rumbling, sharp with excitement and violence.

	Huge CROWDS have thronged the massive old square outside
	the cathedral.  Holding the mule by its reins, COLUMBUS
	tries to push his way through... Suddenly, as a gap opens
	in the crowd, we see the cause of the excitement:  in the
	center of the square stand three pyres, already alit.
	HOODED EXECUTIONERS are busy around the fires.FERNANDOLook, Father!

	Before COLUMBUS can stop him, FERNANDO has slipped off the
	mule and into the crowd.COLUMBUSFernando!

	But the BOY has been swallowed into the mass of people.
	COLUMBUS tries to follow him.  Flames leap into the night
	sky with a terrible crackling, lighting up the square with
	a lurid glow.  Prayers are being chanted somewhere.

	FERNANDO has elbowed his way to the front of the crowd.

	A PRIEST brandishes a crucifix in front of the face of a
	MAN bound to a post.  The heretic wears the "sambenito", a
	robe made of coarse fabric on which his sins have been
	crudely illustrated -- we see cabalistic signs,
	indicating that the man is Jewish.

	THE MAN'S eyes are mad with fear.  But he refuses to kiss
	the crucifix, as a sign of his repentance.

	FERNANDO is transfixed by the scene, but still doesn't
	realize what is happening.  He is too close to the
	platform to see what is in the flames of the other pyres.COLUMBUSFernando!

	He motions to his son, takes the BOY'S hand, and drags him
	away from the scene.  But FERNANDO looks back.  The
	distance now allows him to see inside the flames.

	A HALF-CHARRED FIGURE -- THE MAN'S face is distorted in a
	silent scream... The neck snaps like burning wood, and the
	head falls on one shoulder.  Then the whole body collapses
	into the fire.INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - HALLWAY AND STABLE - NIGHTCOLUMBUS and FERNANDO lead the mule into the white-washed,
	stone-floored hallway of the modest house.  FERNANDO is
	mute, shocked by what he just witnessed.  COLUMBUS takes
	the mule into its stall, and as he does so, his mother,
	BEATRIX, appears from the kitchen to greet them.  She is a
	beautiful woman in her twenties, a calm, strong, domestic
	personality.  COLUMBUS tousles the BOY'S hair.  FERNANDO
	glances at his MOTHER but looks subdued and doesn't say
	anything.INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHTCOLUMBUS joins BEATRIX in the kitchen, where a MAID is
	cooking.  He explains Fernando's subdued manner.COLUMBUSExecutions.  In the square.

	BEATRIX nods.  He goes to the stone butt and pours water
	on his hands.COLUMBUSThey've agreed to see me in a week.

	BEATRIX puts the candle on the table.  Her face lights up
	with a smile.  He walks to her, and kisses her.COLUMBUSI could be gone for years.BEATRIXI know.COLUMBUSI haven't given you much of a life.BEATRIX(amused)
			Well... that's true.  I have a child
			by a man who won't marry me!  Who's
			always leaving...COLUMBUSAre we going to argue?BEATRIXI'd love to argue with you
			sometimes.  But you're never here!

	They laugh and kiss.COLUMBUSPerhaps I was never meant to live
			with a woman...BEATRIX(still kissing him)
			I find that hard to believe.DISSOLVE TO:INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHTThey are eating around the table, and FERNANDO is
	unusually silent and thoughtful.  COLUMBUS pours a little
	wine into FERNANDO'S water, to distract him.  FERNANDO
	looks up at him, surprised.  COLUMBUS smiles, then looks
	over at BEATRIX.COLUMBUSFernando, don't you think we are
			lucky to live with such a beautiful
			woman?

	He winks at FERNANDO.  BEATRIX smiles.INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHTThe room is dark.  As COLUMBUS approached the bed with a
	candle, it illuminates the naked body of BEATRIX.  BEATRIX
	looks up at him intently.  A drop of wax falls on her
	skin.  She flinches, murmurs...

	They make love.EXT.  SALAMANCA UNIVERSITY - DAYA medieval "campus".  Students-novices are playing
	"pelote", with basket-gloves and a hard ball.  They run
	with their robes tucked around their waist, revealing
	white legs.  Others are studying, reading, hurrying to
	their class.

	We find COLUMBUS watching the game from the steps above
	the court.  Others are waiting with him.  A MONK comes
	from a door, and looks around the group.MONK(hesitant)
			Christopher Columbus?INT.  AUDIENCE ROOM - UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA - DAYAn El Greco painting.  A tableau of twenty MEN sitting on
	dark, sculpted seats.  Candles throw a gloomy light on
	their faces.  Some are Churchmen, others are dressed in
	bourgeois outfits.

	Only one of them is richly dressed in the grand Spanish
	fashion -- he is SANCHEZ, Treasurer of the House of
	Aragon.  A MONK (Don AROJAZ) holds a stick with an ivory
	claw at the top.  Languidly, he scratches his back -- his
	off-hand manner only makes him more impressive than his
	peers.AROJAZYou say Asia can be found by sailing
			west?COLUMBUSYes, your Eminence.  The voyage
			should not take more than six or
			seven weeks.AROJAZUnfortunately, Don Colon, that is
			precisely where our opinions
			differ...
				(pause)
			Are you familiar with the work of
			Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?COLUMBUSI am, Your EminenceAROJAZThen you cannot ignore that
			according to their calculations, the
			circumference of the Earth is
			approximately...
				(he leans forward)
			22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes
			the ocean... uncrossable.

	He leans back, satisfied, and pauses for effect.AROJAZBut you may have found new evidence
			proving that these men of knowledge
			are totally mistaken!

	A ripple of mirthless laughter.COLUMBUSYour Excellencies are aware of the
			statements of Marin de Tyr?HERNANDO DE TALAVERAWe are.COLUMBUSThen you are also aware that his
			theories contradict Ptolemeus... De
			Tyr believes the Ocean to be only
			750 leagues...

	A murmur of protest spreads among the members of the
	Commission.  But Columbus is determined to press his
	theories.COLUMBUSThe Florentine Toscanelli and the
			French Cardinal Pierre d'Ailly both
			think that Marin de Tyr is accurate
			in his calculations.  And therefore,
			that the ocean can be crossed.

	Indignant and amused murmurs.  DIEGO DE DEZA raises his
	voice to quiet the assembly.DIEGO DE DEZAGentlemen, let us suppose Marin de
			Tyr is right...
				(the laughter
				subsides)
			Are we here to examine this proposal
			or not?

	Silence.DIEGO DE DEZA(to Columbus)
			In your opinion, how long would the
			voyage be?COLUMBUSSeven weeks.  Six, during the summer
			months.

	The murmur increases.AROJAZMarin de Tyr is wrong -- and has
			been corrected many times over the
			centuries by the finest geographers.
			Your voyage, Don Colon, would take a
			year!

	A MAN of simple bearing, that COLUMBUS identifies as
	being a seaman, interrupts.VICUNAHow would the crew survive without
			being able to land for fresh water?
			Water is undrinkable after six
			weeks!  You'd never be able to turn
			back!COLUMBUSWe wouldn't have to turn back!  We
			would find land at this point!AROJAZSenor Colon, an experienced captain
			such as yourself will understand our
			concern with the crew.  I am not
			willing to have on my conscience the
			loss of men who would have relied
			upon our judgment.COLUMBUSExcellency, you are right.

	Instantly, the protests stop.COLUMBUSI am a seaman, not a scholar... But
			as a simple man craving for
			knowledge, I have read all the work
			of these renowned geographers and
			discovered that none of them could
			agree on the exact width of this
			ocean...

	He pauses, and starts walking in front of the experts, as
	a lawyer before a grand jury.COLUMBUSTherefore, as a modest man, I
			wonder:  who is right?

	The experts listen.  CLOSE ON SANCHEZ'S FACE, impressed by
	the boldness.COLUMBUSWho is right?  This question remains
			unanswered.

	He walks and stops before TALAVERA, and catches the look
	of SANCHEZ, sitting just behind him.COLUMBUSYour Eminence, there is only one way
			to settle the matter.  And that is
			to make the journey.
				(to the assembly,
				with passion)
			I am ready to risk my life to prove
			it possible.AROJAZYour life, and that of others!COLUMBUSIf they agree to follow me, yes.SANCHEZ (O.S.)Suppose you cross this ocean.
			Suppose you reach Asia.  What would
			Spain do there?

	Conscious of a friendlier voice, COLUMBUS sees the
	Treasurer SANCHEZ, an imposing man in his fifties.COLUMBUSTrade, Your Excellency.  According
			to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China
			is one of the richest of the world.
			Even the meanest buildings are
			roofed with gold.AROJAZ(interrupting)
			Is that all that interests you?
			Gold?COLUMBUSNo.  The Portuguese have already
			discovered black-skinned people.  I,
			too, will find other populations --
			and bring them to the word of God.

	THE MONK smiles thinly.AROJAZChristopher -- Christo Ferens -- the
			Bearer of the Cross!MONK(ironic)
			And Colon -- the one who populates!

	Another small rill of laughter.AROJAZIf God intended our proximity to
			Asia, do you believe he would have
			waited for you to show it to the
			world?COLUMBUSDid He not choose a carpenter's son
			to reveal Himself to the world?

	A hum of interest.  CLOSE ON SANCHEZ -- watching COLUMBUS
	intently, a hint of an admiring smile on his lips.AROJAZSo you consider yourself the chosen
			one?

	A pause.AROJAZDon't you realize your words could
			be considered heretical?COLUMBUS(calmly)
			Blind faith is what I consider
			heresy!

	The murmur turns to an audible gasp.  AROJAZ gets to his
	feet and leans forward, threateningly, the flame of a
	candle only inches from his face.

	There is absolute silence.  COLUMBUS meets the MONK'S gaze
	unflinchingly.COLUMBUS(quietly)
			Asia can be found to the west -- and
			I will prove it.AROJAZIF-GOD-WILLS-IT!EXT.  TERRACE - UNIVERSITY - DAYThe JURY is alone to deliberate.  Food and wine has been
	laid out on tables.  In the distance, students' cries
	carry over the conversation.

	SANCHEZ approaches.AROJAZThe Treasurer of Spain honors us
			with his presence.

	SANCHEZ bows slightly.SANCHEZThe State has some reason to be
			interested in this man's
			proposition, Your Eminence...AROJAZThe Judgment is ours!SANCHEZNaturally.  But I would really
			deplore the loss of such a potential
			opportunity for Spain for a...
			dispute over a point of geography.

	SANCHEZ helps himself to some grapes, looks round at the
	other members of the committee, who pretend not to be
	listening.AROJAZ(interrupting)
			He is a mercenary!  Did he not
			already try to convince the King of
			Portugal of his absurd notions?SANCHEZIndeed.  The world is full of
			mercenaries -- and states often make
			use of them, when it benefits them.
				(casually)
			My only concern is the welfare and
			prosperity of Spain.

	AROJAZ understands the hint, and stops smiling.AROJAZYou would use your influence to
			assist this... intriguer?

	SANCHEZ reaches for a decanter of sherry.SANCHEZYou know, Your Eminence, the
			fascinating thing about power, is
			that what can be given so
			effortlessly...

	He offers the decanter to AROJAZ, who automatically lifts
	his glass.  But instead, SANCHEZ pulls back the decanter,
	pours himself a drink, and replaces it on the table,
	leaving AROJAZ staring at his own empty glass.SANCHEZ... can so easily be taken away.

	And he drinks with a smile.INT.  LA RABIDA - MARCHENA'S STUDY - EVENINGMARCHENA reads aloud the Commission's letter.MARCHENA... and therefore nothing could
			justify the participation of Your
			Highnesses in the venture that
			relies upon such feeble assumptions,
			and which any man of knowledge
			would take to be impractical... if
			not impossible.

	He shakes his head, puts the letter down.  COLUMBUS looks
	appalled; devastated.COLUMBUSThey didn't listen.  They didn't
			want to listen!

	He paces about the book-lined room.MARCHENAYou mustn't give way to despair.
			You must wait.COLUMBUSWait!  I've waited seven years
			already!  How much longer do you
			want me to wait?MARCHENAIf God intends you to go, then you
			will go.COLUMBUS(angrily)
			Damn God!

	MARCHENA is shocked.MARCHENAColon!COLUMBUSDamn all of you!  You all set up
			theories based on what?  You never
			leave the safety of your studies!
			Go out!  Find out what the world is
			about and then tell me something I
			can listen to!

	He seizes a beautiful book from MARCHENA'S desk.COLUMBUSThese don't mean anything!  They're
			full of assumptions!  Out of the
			heads of old men who've never been
			past the end of their gardens!

	He hurls the book across the room.  MARCHENA is horrified.MARCHENANo...!  My books...!

	COLUMBUS seizes more books from the shelves, just sweeping
	them to the floor.COLUMBUSAll of them!  Just lies!MARCHENAColon!  Don't!

	MARCHENA tries to stop him.  In his fury, COLUMBUS

	cries bring three MONKS rushing into the room.

	As COLUMBUS continues to rage and scatter books
	everywhere, they try to stop him, struggling with this
	big, powerful man -- to almost comical effect.  Finally, a
	short, muscular MONK delivers a quick punch that sends
	COLUMBUS crashing to the floor.INT.  CHAPEL OF LA RABIDA - EVENINGCOLUMBUS lies face down on the stone floor.  He is dressed
	in a homespun robe.  His arms are stretched out in

			man doing penance.FERNANDOWhat can you do?DIEGONothing.  That's the point,
			Fernando.

	A pause -- and then FERNANDO lies face down on the floor
	beside his FATHER, and stretches out his arms in the same
	way.  DIEGO is left looking on, unable to bring himself to
	join them.EXT.  CLOISTER - LA RABIDA - DAYAlong the cloister, maps are drying, hanging like laundry
	in the light breeze.  COLUMBUS pins up a new addition.
	Another MONK works nearby, in silence.PINZON (O.S.)Senor Colon?

	COLUMBUS turns, to see a small, stocky MAN approaching:  a
	middle-class gentleman.  He nods.PINZONAh, thank God!  I've been looking
			all over Seville for you!  Never
			expected to find a sailor in a
			monastery, eh?

	He laughs.  COLUMBUS smiles, but doesn't say anything.
	PINZON is clearly a little surprised.PINZONName's Pinzon, by the way.  Martin
			Alonzo Pinzon.  I'm a ship owner
			from Palos...

	COLUMBUS glances around cautiously, and walks a little way
	down the cloister, away from the other MONK, gesturing for
	PINZON to follow him.  PINZON is yet more surprised by
	this strange behavior.PINZON(indicating the
				monk)
			Is he a spy?

	COLUMBUS shakes his head.  PINZON stares at him,
	perplexed.PINZONWhat is it?  Are you a Trappist?

	COLUMBUS shakes his head again.PINZONVow of silence...?  Penance?

	COLUMBUS nods vigorously.PINZONJesus!  Just my luck!

	He takes off his hat, wiping his forehead with a silk
	cloth.PINZONListen.  I'll do the talking for
			both of us.  You just nod.  Agreed?
			Just as I do with the wife.

	COLUMBUS nods.PINZONI know that the Commission turned
			you down, right?  What do you
			expect?  You're a foreigner... But I
			want to help you.

	COLUMBUS gives him a glance like one throws a question in
	the air.PINZONYou wonder why I believe in you?
			Hey, I am a seaman.  And we don't
			like to be told where to go, and
			where not to go.

	COLUMBUS looks at him, and bursts out laughing.  The other
	MONK looks round severely.  COLUMBUS ducks behind a map,
	PINZON following him.  PINZON lowers his voice.PINZONI don't look like it, but I have
			friends at the Court.  The Treasurer
			of Aragon, for example.  He finances
			me.  His name's Santangel.  Ever
			heard of him?

	COLUMBUS shakes his head, but looks increasingly
	interested by what he's hearing.PINZONHe can get you an audience with the
			Queen!  You know why...?  She owes
			him money.  That's how it is.  You
			-- me -- the Queen -- the world and
			his mistress -- agreed?

	COLUMBUS nods.PINZONSo.  What do you say?

	COLUMBUS looks around, catches the disapproving face of
	the MONK, crosses himself, then speaks:COLUMBUSWhere can I meet this man?PINZON(indicating with a
				nod)
			Immediately.

	COLUMBUS turns and sees an elegant Lord in his fifties,
	examining the maps.EXT.  STREETS OF GRANADA - DAYA huge Islamic Crescent being pulled down from the minaret
	of a mosque.  SOLDIERS are holding back a crowd at the
	foot of the tower.  To the ecstatic cries of the crowd, a
	Cross is hoisted up in its place... Astride horses,
	COLUMBUS and the Treasurer SANTANGEL are watching the
	scene.

	They push through an extraordinary scene.  The city of
	Granada has just been reclaimed from the moors after
	several years of siege.  All around them, SPANISH SOLDIERS
	are herding, bedraggled columns of the defeated MOORS,
	bearing only a few possessions.  Ragged, half-starved men,
	women and children.SANTANGELThese people built Granada...
			Centuries ago!  It is a great
			victory over the Moors, Don Colon --
			and yet what a tragedy it is!

	The THREE HORSEMEN pass a procession of grateful
	PENITENTS, who are crawling on their knees, chanting
	psalms and flagellating themselves.  At the head of the
	procession, HOODED PRIESTS carry a statue of the Virgin
	Mary swathed in silk and lace.

	The gates of the Alhambra Palace are in sight.COLUMBUSIs this a good time to meet her?SANTANGELIt couldn't be better.  Victors
			can't say no.

	Bells are pealing triumphantly.  The noise is tumultuous.
	They ride towards the magnificent palace.EXT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - GARDENS - DAYFabulous Moorish gardens:  ponds filled with golden carp;
	exotic bird cages hang from lemon trees... The distant
	sounds of victory.

	SANTANGEL and COLUMBUS walk through the gardens, escorted
	by HALBERDIERS.  SOLDIERS pass by, carrying coffers or
	piles of documents.

	As they approach the inner sanctum, however, there are
	fewer people.  They stop by the Lion's Fountain, where
	several DIGNITARIES are waiting patiently for an audience.

	SANCHEZ appears.  They bow.  SANTANGEL approaches to
	murmur a compliment.SANTANGELYour Excellency... truly grateful...
			your help... as ever...

	SANCHEZ protests softly, and looks over at COLUMBUS, a
	half-smile forming on his lips.  Then a DUENA appears, and
	motions for COLUMBUS to follow.INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAYAn ornate Moorish door is pushed open by the DUENA'S hand.
	We enter the Throne Room -- sculptured colonnades,
	mosaics... At the far end, windows open onto a view of
	Granada's rooftops.

	Against this dazzling light, the delicate silhouette of
	QUEEN ISABEL OF SPAIN.  The light in her blonde hair
	creates a halo around her head as she turns.  COLUMBUS
	falls to his knees.ISABELRise...!  Come forward!

	He approaches the window, stopping close to her.  ISABEL
	scrutinizes him quickly.ISABELI should not even be listening to
			you, since my council said no.  But
			Santangel tells me you are a man of
			honor and sincerity... And Sanchez,
			that you are not a fool.COLUMBUS(bold)
			No more than the woman who said she
			would take Granada from the Moors.

	ISABEL smiles, enjoying the lack of obsequiousness.ISABELThe ocean is uncrossable?COLUMBUSWhat did they say about Granada
			before today?ISABEL(a beat)
			That she was impregnable.

	ISABEL smiles again.ISABELI cannot ignore the verdict of my
			council.COLUMBUSSurely you can do anything you want.

	A direct challenge.  She doesn't know what to make of this
	man.ISABELHow little you know.

	This little hint of vulnerability subtly reverses their
	positions for a moment.  Now we sense COLUMBUS
	scrutinizing her.COLUMBUSMay I speak freely?ISABEL(with a smile)
			You show no inclination to speak
			otherwise!COLUMBUSI know what I see.  I see someone
			who doesn't accept the world as it
			is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a
			women who thinks... "What if?"...ISABEL(amused at his
				familiarity)
			A woman?

	A slight pause.COLUMBUSForgive me... but you're the only
			Queen I know.

	She bursts out laughing.ISABELThen we are equal... since you are
			the only sailor I know!

	A beat.ISABELHow old are you, Senor Colon?COLUMBUSThirty seven, Your Majesty... And
			you?

	Once again taken off guard, ISABEL flushes, and turns away
	slightly to hide it.ISABELThirty eight...

	A pause.ISABELYou will be informed of our
			decision.

	COLUMBUS bows and goes to leave.  As the DUENA opens the
	door for him, he turns back.COLUMBUSActually, I thought you were younger
			than me!

	And he goes out, leaving her stunned.EXT.  SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - TREE-LINED ROAD - DAYA chalk white road, lined with trees.  Two liveried
	SERVANTS are walking down the road, one carrying a large
	silver tray, the other a smaller tray.

	the road, with documents under his arm.EXT.  SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - STABLE BLOCK AND PADDOCK - DAYThe CLERK enters an imposing stable block.

	In the paddock, SANCHEZ is training a magnificent young
	horse, making it step sideways, bending it to his will.
	The ADMINISTRATOR watches him, unable to interrupt.

	Behind him the two SERVANTS can be seen bringing in the
	silver trays, with covered dishes of food, a decanter of
	wine.  They begin to lay them out on a table.EXT.  SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - STABLE BLOCK AND PADDOCK - LATERSANCHEZ pours himself some wine, tucks into his his food,

	And he carries on eating.SANCHEZYou worry too much, Carvajal... The

	What they see:

	SANCHEZ and COLUMBUS together.  COLUMBUS is visibly upset.SANCHEZ(calmly)
			We have considered your -- demands

	COLUMBUS tightens his fists, tries to remain calm.COLUMBUSIf I am right, my requests are fair!

	SANCHEZ holds up a document.SANCHEZWe have prepared our own contract...

	He offers the document to COLUMBUS, who takes it, scans it
	quickly, shakes his head.COLUMBUSNo...SANCHEZNo?COLUMBUSNO...!  I have waited too long,

	COLUMBUS leans over the table, faces him.COLUMBUSAnd were you never ambitious,

			If you won't accept our proposal,

	COLUMBUS smiles.COLUMBUSIf you can do that, Excellency --

	He turns, strides towards the door.  We hear a WOMAN'S
	muffled laughter.

	As COLUMBUS goes out, ISABEL appears through a secret

	a glass of wine.  There is a movement behind him.  BEATRIX
	is standing at the foot of the stairs, in a night-shirt.

	COLUMBUS turns and looks at her, almost sad.COLUMBUSShe said yes.BEATRIX(moved)

	She smiles.  But he seems to be unable to share her

	Sitting at his desk, COLUMBUS is looking at the map.FERNANDO (O.S.)You can't go there!

	Turning, COLUMBUS finds his son beside him.COLUMBUSWhy not?

	FERNANDO points at the monsters.  He pulls the boy to him.COLUMBUSThere aren't any monsters, Fernando.

	And he hugs his SON tightly.EXT.  HILLSIDE AND GATE - PRE-DAWNA luminous procession passes through a Moorish stone gate,
	down to the harbor.  We see the faces of the SAILORS and

	The caravels are being towed by three rowing boats.

	CLOSE ON THE MEN, rowing, drenched with sweat.

	FROM THE PROW, COLUMBUS is staring at the horizon.

	ALONSO pulling at his oars stares at COLUMBUS' distant
	figure with hate and resentment.

	ALONSO suddenly ships his oars, throwing the whole boat
	into disarray.  Chaos.

	Total silence.  MENDEZ and ALONSO stare at each other.MENDEZContinue rowing!ALONSOTo where?

	ALONSO defiantly stares at MENDEZ.  He then starts to beat
	a rhythm on the hull with his fist, followed by the
	others.  In the two other boats, the MEN begin to follow
	suit, beating a rhythm of protest on the hulls.

	MENDEZ looks up to COLUMBUS, in panic.

	COLUMBUS moves to the door.  As an afterthought, he takes
	his scarlet-embroidered jacket from a hook.EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAYMost of the men are now back on board.

	They go silent as COLUMBUS appears.  He walks slowly over
	to them.  All, including ALONSO, are surly, threatening...COLUMBUSWho gave you the order to come on

	He looks up and down the line, finishing on ALONSO.  They
	stare at one another.ALONSOGod doesn't want us to cross the

	Some of the MEN murmur their agreement.COLUMBUSCursed?ALONSOWe set sail for greed.  God has

	ALONSO glances towards the SHIP'S BOY, with his hair lip.
	The BOY lowers his eyes.  COLUMBUS moves towards him,
	pulls him forward, stands him in front of ALONSO.COLUMBUSThis boy has the voice of an angel.
			What comes out of his mouth is
			blessed, Alonso.  What comes out of

	Some of the men laugh at this statement.  ALONSO is ill at
	ease.  COLUMBUS pauses, looks around at all the MEN.COLUMBUSListen to me!  Every man is afraid
			who does something for the first
			time.  But those who overcome their
			fears, will find their rewards.  I
			do not know if it is God's will that

	The MEN are listening.  We sense a subtle change of
	mood...COLUMBUSThis jacket to the first man who
			sights land!  I want a man up that

	COLUMBUS points at the SHIP'S BOY.COLUMBUSYou start first.

	The SHIP'S BOY rushes up the mast.  As he climbs, the
	mainsail starts to fill with wind.  The deck begins to
	move under their feet.

	This movement under their feet seems to imperceptibly
	erase the fears and the angers.MENDEZAlonso!  Jaime!  Don't let this wind

	Turning abruptly, he enters his cabin.EXT.  SANTA MARIA - PROW - MISTY NIGHTCOLUMBUS is seated, isolated at the prow, wrapped in his

	COLUMBUS shakes his head no, and starts drinking from the
	bowl.CUT TO:COLUMBUS' head nods lower and lower to his chest.  He is
	asleep.  We become aware of a sharp buzzing sound.  It
	becomes louder as we move closer to COLUMBUS' face.

	A mosquito lands on his temple.  COLUMBUS reflexively
	slaps it.  He wakes up, and looks at his fingers -- a spot
	of blood, a crushed mosquito.  He stares at it for a
	moment.  Then slowly gets to his feet.EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - NIGHTIn the luminous moonlight, COLUMBUS is standing, staring
	up at thousands of insects that wheel around the mast
	lantern.  We hear the flutter of their wings and see the
	bats as they swoop and dive in a feeding frenzy.

	COLUMBUS turns, stares into the darkness, desperate to see
	the land that must be close.

	He kneels by MENDEZ, wrapped in a blanket.  He touches his

	The entire CREW stand and stare, silent, holding their
	breath.

	As the sun begins to rise, the fog dissipates -- slowly,
	exquisitely, revealing a single palm, so close it seems
	almost as though they could touch it.  Then a white slash
	of beach.

	Near COLUMBUS, a SAILOR falls to his knees and burst into
	tears.  Others laugh with joy.  COLUMBUS watches this
	vision in disbelief, his mouth open as if it were
	difficult for him to breathe.  Tears come to his eyes.  He
	closes them.  Then opens them again.  The land is there --
	a green paradise.

	On screen the words:  OCTOBER 12, 1942.  GUANAHAN ISLANDEXT.  BOATS - DAYThree row boats plunging through the surf towards the
	beach.  COLUMBUS stands in the prow of the first boat.
	MENDEZ is in the second.  PINZON the third.  They stare
	entranced at the lushness of the foliage, and the blue
	clarity of the water...

	As the first boat beaches, COLUMBUS leaps out and wades
	ashore.  Behind him the rest of the landing party splash
	through the sun-dazzled water, carrying the banner of
	Castille and Aragon.EXT.  BEACH - DAYThey stand on the beach, almost in a dream.  There is
	silence.  The ROYAL NOTARY, ludicrously overdressed, now
	wet through, stumbles over to COLUMBUS and holds out his
	contract and a pen.  COLUMBUS scrawls his name.

	The MEN stare at him, filled not only with new respect,
	but with something amounting to awe.

	COLUMBUS turns to them, tries to speak.COLUMBUSBy the... by the Grace of... God...

	He swallows.  Tears have sprung to his eyes.  He is so
	moved he cannot continue.  Coming to his rescue -- THE
	SHIP'S BOY starts to roll the drum.  He then stops.COLUMBUS(pulling himself
				together)
			In the name of their Gracious
			Majesties of Castille and Aragon,
			and by all the powers vested in me,
			I claim this island and name it San

	The MEN cheer as the flags are rammed into the sand,
	flapping in the wind.

	COLUMBUS starts to walk towards the jungle, and in silence
	the rest follow.EXT.  JUNGLE - DAYImmediately they are met by an incredible wall of SOUND!
	The jungle is filled with NOISE.  The impossibly-loud
	CRIES of EXOTIC BIRDS, the CHATTERING of MONKEYS.  The
	SPANIARDS are overwhelmed.

	They move forward.  Rays of sunlight pierce through the
	high canopy of leaves, like the roof of a magnificent
	cathedral.  The sounds and smells intoxicate their senses.
	They are filled with wonder.

	Then PINZON stops.  He has seen something.  Another stops,
	then a third, staring ahead of them...MENDEZ(whispering
				urgently)
			Arquebuses!

	Several of them raise their weapons to their shoulders,
	pointing them into the jungle.

	From COLUMBUS' POV we slowly scan the face of the thick
	jungle ahead.  For a moment we don't see anything -- and
	then, with a shock, we see the first INDIAN.  Naked,
	painted like an idol, carrying a hunting lance.

	As if they had materialized from nowhere:  the rest of the
	HUNTING PARTY, with their bows and spears.  Silent.
	Watchful.  They stare back at us.

	The SPANIARDS nervously finger their weapons.

	COLUMBUS slowly lifts his hand into the air:  a clear
	signal not to fire.  Then, removing his sword, he drops it
	on the ground, and starts to walk forward, fixing his gaze
	upon the first INDIAN he saw.PINZON(warningly)
			Colon!

	COLUMBUS ignores him, even though some of the INDIANS have
	raised their weapons.  He stops in the no-man's land
	between them.  The INDIANS don't move -- but something
	excites them.

	The SHIP'S BOY, wearing COLUMBUS' embroidered jacket and
	the drum, has followed COLUMBUS and now stands close to
	him.  He is the cause of their interest.  COLUMBUS puts
	his arm around the BOY, and this gesture of affection
	seems to put the INDIANS at their ease.  They start
	talking and pointing.  They come forward slowly, start to
	tentatively touch the BOY'S jacket.  Then, now laughing,
	they touch COLUMBUS, pulling at his beard.  COLUMBUS
	laughs too.

	Sensing their innocence, the rest of the MEN lower their
	weapons.  Some of them laugh.

	An apparition:  a beautiful young INDIAN GIRL, totally
	naked, walks out of the jungle.

	She is pregnant and holds a child.  We begin to hear
	Indian music, played on a flute.CUT TO:EXT.  INDIAN VILLAGE - DAYA large post is lifted from the ground by two SPANIARDS
	pulling on ropes.  The post is fixed into position -- and
	then we see that it is a large wooden cross... The INDIAN
	VILLAGERS watch the ceremony with some interest and
	amusement.

	COLUMBUS looks over at the men and gestures at theINDIANS.COLUMBUSWe have come here in peace, and we
			will behave with honor.  They are
			not savages and neither will you be.
			Treat these people as you would your
			own wives and your own children.

	INDIANS have prepared food for the SPANIARDS, who are
	drinking and enjoying themselves in this strange world.

	COLUMBUS sits with MENDEZ, PINZON, the INDIAN CHIEF,
	ELDERS OF THE VILLAGE.  Other INDIANS stand around,
	smiling, curious.

	The INDIANS talk among themselves.  The ELDERS smoke
	primitive cigars -- and offer them, with good humor, to
	their guests.  The SPANIARDS cough and choke at first...
	and laugh.  In return, they offer the INDIANS wine...

	Dogs roam around the campfires.  The WOMEN openly suckle
	their babies.  The MEN are entranced.

	PINZON draws out attention, for the first time, to a small
	gold ornament on the nose of one of the INDIANS.  He
	points to it, indicates his interest in it.PINZONGold...!  Gold!

	The INDIANS says the word in his own language, laughing.
	We see that some of the other INDIANS also have small gold
	ornaments.

	PINZON repeats the INDIAN word for gold.  The INDIAN
	removes the ornament from his nose, gives it to PINZON,
	who indicates that he wants to have it.  The INDIAN nods
	-- but points to PINZON'S dagger, indicating that he wants
	it in return.  PINZON shakes his head, stops the INDIAN
	from taking it.COLUMBUS(to Pinzon)
			Give it to him!

	PINZON looks at him, about to argue -- but COLUMBUS
	insists.  PINZON takes out the dagger and offers it to theINDIAN.PINZON(irritated)
			By God!  That's the worst trade of
			my life!

	His friends laugh.  Innocently, the INDIAN has taken it by
	the blade.  He yelps, looks down at the blood welling
	up... A moment of tension... Then MENDEZ laughs at his
	clumsiness, and the ELDERS laugh too... and the INDIAN
	laughs.

	Just outside this circle, we see the first INDIAN we saw,
	squatting on his haunches, watching.  This is UTAPAN.INT.  TENT - DAWNThe first light outside -- the strange, wonderful sounds
	of the jungle all around.  COLUMBUS writes in his journal.COLUMBUS (V.O.)October 21st, 1492.  I think we have
			returned to Eden.  Surely this is
			how the world once was, before the
			beginning of time.  I believe no man
			will ever see this land again as we
			do, for the first time...

	He looks up.  UTAPAN is squatting in the doorway of the
	hut.  He's been there all night.  COLUMBUS takes more ink
	on his quill and begins to sketch UTAPAN'S face in the
	margin of his log-book.  He draws well.

	He gets up and walks over to UTAPAN and shows him the
	drawing.  It's an electrifying moment.  UTAPAN is shocked
	and amazed.  At first he is rather frightened of his own
	image... Then he is happy, and laughs... and COLUMBUS
	laughs with him and puts a hand on his shoulder in a
	gesture of friendship.

	UTAPAN gets up, and indicates that he too has something he
	wishes to offer.EXT.  JUNGLE - MORNINGUTAPAN expertly scampering through the jungle.  COLUMBUS
	follows him.

	UTAPAN orders COLUMBUS to sit.  COLUMBUS obeys.  UTAPAN
	looks up at the tops of the trees.  The sun is rising, and
	filters through the foliage.  As if the time had come,
	UTAPAN stands up, and COLUMBUS does the same.

	A gap in the dense vegetation.  Something is glittering.
	Gold.  A mass of gold.  As they approach, COLUMBUS
	discovers --

	A large pool of fresh water.  The morning sunlight has
	turned the water into liquid gold.  The surface ripples
	with the breeze.  UTAPAN smiles.  It the stranger
	satisfied?  Isn't this what he came for?

	COLUMBUS plunges into the pool.  As he emerges, he fills
	his palms with liquid gold.DISSOLVE TO:EXT.  RIVER - DAYWide shot -- A flotilla of canoes are going upstream.

	off his boot, and grabs his foot, examining the blisters
	on his toes.  As he puts his foot back into the boot, he
	jumps screaming in pain.

	ALONSO yelps, grasping his ankle.

	CLOSE ON a snake sliding out of the empty boot.

	While his COMPANIONS rush to him, a SAILOR spots the
	snake, and decapitates it with his sword.  UTAPAN glances
	at the dead snake.  He then goes and kneels -- he sees the
	bite on ALONSO'S ankle.COLUMBUSHelp him!

	ALONSO is quiet and silent.  His eyes are looking around
	at his companions.  UTAPAN shakes his head.  There is
	nothing he can do.

	ALONSO is now leaning back, supported by one of his
	friends.  He has grabbed the forearm of a SAILOR.  His
	look is already far away.  His companion shouts at UTAPAN.SAILORDo something!  Help him!UTAPANHe dead.

	ALONSO starts convulsing.  HIS FRIENDS hold him, desperate
	in their helplessness.  Others simply move away,
	horrified.  One of them cries.EXT.  RIVER - DAYStanding in the stream up to his thighs, A SPANIARD (a
	gold expert) examines some stones.  He then looks up at
	COLUMBUS and PINZON and just throws the stones back into
	the water without a word.

	The group of SPANIARDS are resting, exhausted by the
	humidity.  Some are drinking from the river, others soak
	bandanas, and tie them around their necks...

	One after another, they stand up slowly -- they look
	discouraged, tired, and beaten.EXT.  MOUNTAINOUS JUNGLE - DAYUTAPAN and the SPANIARDS are trekking in the hills.  Fully

	trots forward.

	Finally, COLUMBUS turns around and sees... nobody.  He
	calls out to UTAPAN.COLUMBUSUtapan!  Wait!

	UTAPAN stops obediently, and rushes back to COLUMBUS with
	comical energy.

	On their way back, they find one SOLDIER sitting, leaning
	against a tree.  He has removed his helmet.  His hair
	sticking to his forehead.

	As COLUMBUS and UTAPAN walk back, they find another
	SAILOR, then another, then the whole group gathered around
	PINZON.  Ashen, he burns with fever.  He attempts a smile.PINZONWell... You'll have to continue

	COLUMBUS looks around him -- what he sees:  exhausted men

	collapses.EXT.  JUNGLE - DAYA line of SPANIARDS and INDIANS threading their way down a

	MENDEZ and UTAPAN watch the CHIEF GUARIONEX putting a
	Spanish helmet on his head.  The helmet is too big, almost
	covering his eyes.  The ELDERS appraise the gift with
	solemn wonder.

	In return, GUARIONEX hands COLUMBUS a parcel made of
	leaves.  COLUMBUS unwraps them.  Inside:  a GOLD grimacing
	mask.  The first real piece of gold.  COLUMBUS is unable
	to conceal his excitement at this first real evidence of
	the metal.

	He waits for the CHIEF to speak, but the CHIEF only looks
	at him.  On the ground, we see other presents offered by
	the SPANIARDS -- trinkets, and necklaces...UTAPAN(to Columbus)

	Suddenly the cabin seems to lurch over.  Things fall from
	the table, smashing on the floor... COLUMBUS nearly falls.EXT.  SEA - NIGHTWe are in the middle of a violent storm -- of terrifying
	proportions.  The thunder is deafening.  Light irradiates
	the darkness.  We see the two caravels, dwarfed by the
	massive seas.EXT.  DECK - NIGHTFive MEN are struggling to lash down the tiller.  The deck
	jumps and rolls.  It rises five meters into the air then
	falls into space and hits the water with a terrible crack.
	Waves sweep over the decks.  We hear desperate cries for
	mercy from the terrified crew, loud enough to be heard
	above the storm.

	COLUMBUS and MENDEZ are crawling towards the mast, along a
	lifeline.COLUMBUS(screaming to the

	The MEN start to scramble below decks.COLUMBUS(to Mendez)
			Stay with me!

	The ship rolls again.  COLUMBUS and MENDEZ crawl towards
	the mast.  Another gigantic wave crashes over them, tons
	of water falling like cement.  They reach the mast.  The
	wood groans.COLUMBUSWe may have to cut it!

	MENDEZ nods... COLUMBUS grabs some rope.  The ship rises
	into the air again, crashes down, the deck disappearing
	beneath them for a moment.COLUMBUS(screaming out)
			I'll stay here -- to decide if we
			cut it.  Help me!

	With MENDEZ'S help, COLUMBUS is tied to the mast:  one

	MENDEZ seems to hesitate.  COLUMBUS screams at him again.COLUMBUSI said -- below deck, Mendez!

	MENDEZ crawls away.

	Another huge wave washes over COLUMBUS.  He emerges,
	almost suffocated.  The storm rages, its eerie light
	making it seem at times like bright daylight.  But as the

	There's an enormous thunderclap on "four" -- it indicates
	how close they are to the eye of the storm.

	The ship keels over again, dropping down and down, seeming
	never to rise... COLUMBUS lifts his head to the heavens,
	screams out:COLUMBUSDamn you!

	As if in answer, another flash of lightning that
	illuminates the sky and the sea.  COLUMBUS starts counting
	again.COLUMBUSOne... two... three... four...
			five...

	Another terrible clap of thunder on "five" -- COLUMBUS
	starts laughing, knowing the storm is moving on.

	Then, in the strange light, something seems to move
	through the air towards him; it looks like some kind of
	projectile, a craft, with a trail of vapor.

	COLUMBUS stares up at it... amazed.  We start to hear the
	"Te Deum", majestic and heavenly.CUT TO:INT.  CATHEDRAL OF CORDOBA - SPAIN - DAYCOLUMBUS looks up at the vast roof, to see an incense
	burner, swinging, gliding swiftly across the ceiling,
	trailing a think vapor of incense.

	A magnificent "Te Deum" is being sung -- in honor of
	COLUMBUS' achievements and return.  The whole cathedral is
	packed with nobles and dignitaries in their gorgeous
	robes.

	BEATRIX, FERNANDO and DIEGO are staring in fascination at
	COLUMBUS' triumph -- somewhat separated by the grandeur of
	this occasion.  COLUMBUS passes by, walking proudly down
	the long central alley, beside KING FERDINAND and QUEEN
	ISABEL and other GRANDEES.  He turns to his family,
	keeping his eyes on BEATRIX until she is out of his
	vision.

	The procession is followed by UTAPAN, and other INDIANS in
	tribal regalia...

	whisper to him.AROJAZIt won't be easy to get rid of your

	DE MOXICA.  Hesitantly, he brings a lighted cigar to his
	lips -- then pauses.

	We discover other people around the magnificent candle-lit
	table.  NOBLE MEN and NOBLE WOMEN.  SANCHEZ.  COLUMBUS.QUEEN ISABEL.COLUMBUS takes the cigar from MOXICA.  The rest watch him
	with rapt curiosity.  COLUMBUS inhales deeply then, to
	their astonishment, blows out the smoke through his nose.COLUMBUSYou must not inhale, but simply
			allow the palate to enjoy the flavor
			of the Tobacco...

	He hands the cigar back to MOXICA.  With a casual air,
	MOXICA himself inhales deeply -- almost chokes to death.
	He gulps down a glass of wine... much to the amusement of
	the others.MOXICA(deeply embarrassed)
			And you say this is an Indian vice?
			By God!  I don't see any kind of
			pleasure that would make this a sin.COLUMBUSThe Indians have no such word, Don
			Moxica.ISABELDo they have such thoughts?COLUMBUSThey come and go as naked as the day
			God created them...

	ISABEL blushes slightly.COLUMBUSThey don't see sin in their

	COLUMBUS nods, turns and whispers something to a SERVANT
	standing just behind his chair.  The SERVANT goes to open
	the door -- and in comes UTAPAN, dressed as a tribesman,
	carrying a casket.  The WOMEN around the table fan
	themselves furiously at the sight.  UTAPAN puts the casket
	down in front of the QUEEN, and steps back.COLUMBUSThese are gifts for Your Majesty.

	ISABEL opens the casket, revealing the gleam of gold
	inside.  She takes out some of the little golden
	ornaments... a bracelet and then the mask.

	She holds it, somehow moved by its crude beauty.

	ISABEL raises the mask to her face, looking across atCOLUMBUS.The image is somehow powerful enough to reduce even the
	ARISTOCRATS to silence.  She speaks from behind the mask.ISABELWe are more than gratified.

	The guests laugh obsequiously.  COLUMBUS bows a little --
	looks up and meets the eyes of SANCHEZ, who is staring at
	him, coldly.INT.  ROTUNDA - DAYA SWORD MASTER advances towards us with determination, his
	sword flashing.  He is fighting an adversary we do not
	see, and comments his movements.MASTERSi!  Si!  Muy bien!  Excellente!
			(Yes!  Yes!  Good!  Excellent!)

	We discover the SWORD MASTER is fencing with COLUMBUS.  A
	dozen duellists are practicing in the magnificent rotunda,
	surrounded with a two-tiered colonnade.

	Out of breath, COLUMBUS stops the exercise, and removes
	his protective canvas padding.  He bows at his teacher,
	who salutes him in return.

	COLUMBUS walks to a tressel laden with food and beverages.
	SANCHEZ, in a fencing outfit and boots, is having a glass
	of wine.  Upon seeing COLUMBUS approaching, he hands him a
	glass.SANCHEZYou defend yourself admirably...COLUMBUS... for a commoner?

	SANCHEZ laughs and raises his glass.SANCHEZTo your second expedition.

			A little hypocrisy goes a long way.INT.  ROOM - ADMINISTRATION - DAYCOLUMBUS with two MEN:  the oldest, around thirty, is a
	strong-looking man.  The youngest, no more than twenty
	five, is thin and fit.  There is obvious tension in the
	room.  These are BARTOLOME and GIACOMO COLON, COLUMBUS'
	brothers.  BARTOLOME is angry, and GIACOMO thoughtful.BARTOLOMEYou might have given us a choice!GIACOMOBartolome is stronger, more capable
			than I will ever be...COLUMBUSI need both of you.  What are you
			afraid of?  We are living what we
			always dreamt of.GIACOMOYou know I never shared those dreams
			with you.COLUMBUSAre you saying you refuse to help?

	COLUMBUS looks at them with such pained surprise...BARTOLOME(amused)
			You bastard... you always had your
			own way...COLUMBUSLet me show you something.

	He opens the door to a terrace.CUT TO:EXT.  GALLERY - DAYThe large gallery courtyard is crowded with PEOPLE --
	applicants for the voyage.  As COLUMBUS appears, they all
	press forward, calling out his name, trying to get his
	attention, touching his sleeves as if he were a saint.
	They crowd around COLUMBUS and his BROTHERS.  COLUMBUS
	nods, murmurs vaguely, here and there...COLUMBUSOf course... Of course... We'll see
			to it... Yes... Thank you... Soon...
			Soon...

	Fighting their way through, the BOTHERS press their way,
	reaching the other side of the gallery.  We get glimpses
	of the incredible activity down below.  ADMINISTRATORS,
	MILITARIES, MERCHANTS are busy around tressels covered
	with documents, plans, maps... preparing the second
	expedition.

	COLUMBUS puts his arms around them.COLUMBUS(indicating the
				applicants)
			Now -- you tell me.  Who can I
			trust?
				(almost amused)
			We're brothers!  We must be a House.
			A bloodline!  In this country one
			can't exist alone!  I need you...!
			Both of you!

	He walks then to the balustrade.  The cries from the
	courtyard down below subside... some of the applicants
	begin to look up, aware of his presence.SOLDIERWhere is the Admiral?  Has anyone
			seen the Admiral?

	Everybody laughs.COLUMBUSHe is here!  What is it?

	He leans over the balcony.  In the middle of the
	overcrowded courtyard, the SOLDIER who was shouting is
	brandishing a document.MANAdmiral!  The horses have arrived.COLUMBUSI know.  I saw them!  Who did we
			hire today?

	ANOTHER ASSISTANT raises his eyes.ASSISTANTThirty blacksmiths, twenty eight

	The whole courtyard bursts out laughing.EXT.  ORANGERY - VICEROY'S HOUSE - DAYUTAPAN is lying in his hammock.  FERNANDO turns him over.
	UTAPAN falls to the ground.

	COLUMBUS walks beside BEATRIX.COLUMBUS(looking at his son)

	BEATRIX smiles, nods.  They walk on.COLUMBUSBeatrix, I want to ask you
			something.BEATRIX(with a smile)
			You don't usually ask.COLUMBUS(after a pause)
			I can arrange for the Queen to take
			Fernando and Diego into her service.

	BEATRIX stops in her tracks, looks at him.COLUMBUSIt is a great honor.  We could not
			hope for anything better.

	BEATRIX nods, but bites her lip, and looks back atFERNANDO.BEATRIXFor once I wish you weren't right.

	COLUMBUS puts his arm around her waist, pulling her
	closer, they move away.EXT.  FAR END OF THE ORANGERY - DAYFERNANDO is now swinging expertly in the hammock.  UTAPAN
	is pushing him gently.  He slowly straightens up to watch
	COLUMBUS and BEATRIX disappear, somehow sensing there is a
	dilemma.  FERNANDO noticing UTAPAN'S reaction, turns to
	his parents.  The arbor is empty.  FERNANDO becomes
	pensive.

	We become aware of the rustling of the jungle.SLOW DISSOLVE TO:EXT.  BEACH AND EDGE OF JUNGLE - DAYFIFTEEN HUNDRED MEN spread along the beach, looking
	towards the jungle.  COLUMBUS stands beside his BROTHERS,
	and MENDEZ, and UTAPAN.

	MOXICA, astride a magnificent black horse, prances back
	and forth across the sand.  All are waiting.

	A signal cannon is fired from one of the ships.  Birds
	scatter into the air from the jungle -- but then silence,
	complete and ominous.  COLUMBUS stares into the jungle.
	Nothing.  No one to greet them -- no welcoming party from
	the MEN they left behind.

	COLUMBUS glances at MENDEZ.

	MENDEZ looks at him, but can't answer.

	MOXICA suddenly spurs on his horse, and guides it into the
	trees.  The order is given for the rest to follow, fanning
	out as they do so, weapons at the ready.EXT.  CLEARING - JUNGLE - DAYRuins.  The camp has been burned to ashes.  A strange
	sight:  arrows are stuck vertically into the ground, each
	with a moldering tuft of human hair attached to the
	flight.

	In silence the SOLDIERS pick their way through the
	devastation.

	The ground is littered with coconuts.  Kicking one over
	with his shoe, a SOLDIER discovers that his coconut is
	actually a human skull.  The gaping mouth has been filled
	to the brim with gold.

	But of the living, there is no sign.MOXICAIs this your new world, Don Colon?

	COLUMBUS looks around in dismay.  A YOUNG NOBLEMAN,
	HERNANDO DE GUEVARA, takes out his sword.GUEVARAThese animals should be shown what
			savagery can be!

	Other SPANIARDS join in, repeating this last word.NOBLEMANThree heads for every life taken.
			No mercy before God!GUEVARANo mercy!  Let's find them.COLUMBUSNo Guevara.  There will be no

	Silence.  Everyone looks at COLUMBUS.MOXICAWe lost cousins, friends.  We will
			wash this in blood.COLUMBUSIf you want to keep your head on
			your shoulders, you'll do as I say.

	They are all listening.COLUMBUSMoxica, I lost friends too... Thirty
			nine brave men who trusted me.

	He walks among them.COLUMBUSYou want a war?  Fine.  We are a
			thousand.  They outnumber us by ten!
			Who will you kill?  Which tribe?MOXICAWe don't need to know.COLUMBUSWe came here to stay!  To build!
			Not to start a crusade.  In this
			forest, there is enough danger to
			sweep us away in days!  So we will
			be brave and swallow our grief.  And
			in the name of those who died, we
			will accomplish what we came for.EXT.  INDIAN VILLAGE - DAYMOXICA mounted on his magnificent BLACK STALLION canters
	to the edge of the deserted village and enters the
	village.  UTAPAN is terrorized by the absence of anything
	living.

	All we can hear is the breathing of the horse.  The
	animal, an impressive mass of muscle, prances nervously.

	UTAPAN calls out in dialect.UTAPANThey here.

	Slowly, they begin to appear, one after the other --
	materializing from the jungle.  Shy and scared.

	They stare at this "Centaur" (the HORSE and the HORSEMAN
	seem to be one -- a God).

	To impress them even more, MOXICA makes the beast move
	sideways and backwards, rearing, its front hoofs pawing
	the air.  THE INDIANS retreat in terror, except for one,
	who stands his ground, brandishing his lance.

	UTAPAN encourages the YOUNG WARRIOR to approach the
	centaur.  He places his hand onto the shoulder of the
	animal.  The muscles shudder.  THE INDIAN jumps back
	comically, accompanied by the rest of the tribe.

	Without warning, MOXICA climbs down from the saddle.  More
	INDIANS step back in fear and absolute astonishment.  Now
	more have ventured from the jungle.  The bravest of them
	approach MOXICA, daring to touch him, and the horse,
	retreating then touching until they fill the compound.

	At this moment, COLUMBUS and his SOLDIERS appear all
	around them, pointing their muskets, and their crossbows.
	A moment of tension.

	COLUMBUS walks forward, towards the CHIEF (GUARIONEX) we
	meet before.COLUMBUSAsk the Chief what happened to my
			men?

	The CHIEF answers.UTAPANAnother tribe made war on them...
			came by sea... took them away...BROTHER BUYLGod have mercy on their souls...MOXICAThe monkey is lying.

	A pause.  The SPANIARDS shifting, eager for blood.MOXICAWe should kill them, Don Colon.

	UTAPAN looks anxiously at COLUMBUS.COLUMBUSNo...!  you'll do it my way.
				(to Utapan)
			Tell the Chief we will not harm his
			people, even though we have the
			power to do it.

	UTAPAN translates.  The CHIEF listens in silence.COLUMBUSWe will work with his people.  We
			want peace.  Ask the Chief if he
			understands?UTAPANHe understands.COLUMBUSAsk him if he will help.CUT TO:EXT.  WATERMILL AND DAM UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DAYIt is raining hard.  COLUMBUS is floundering in the mud,
	supervising a mixed work-force of SPANISH and INDIANS.
	They are attempting to raise the huge wheel of a
	watermill.

	Despite COLUMBUS' shouts of encouragement, it's clear the
	wheel is far too heavy and the mud too deep.

	Close by, on horseback, MOXICA watches the scene.
	COLUMBUS, plastered with wet mud, clambers out of the pit
	and approaches him.COLUMBUSDon Moxica -- we need your horse.

	MOXICA looks down at the sodden, dirty figure.COLUMBUSWe can't raise the wheel without it.MOXICAMy horse doesn't work.

	A beat.  COLUMBUS wipes some mud from his eyes.COLUMBUSDon Moxica -- we all have to work.MOXICAYou did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not
			my horse.

	He starts to turn away; COLUMBUS grabs hold of the reins.COLUMBUSForgive me, Don Moxica.  But it was
			your horse I was talking about.

	A beat.  MOXICA stares down at an equally determined
	COLUMBUS.  Then, in front of everyone, MOXICA has to
	dismount, and suffer the disgrace of it.COLUMBUSThank you, Don Moxica.

	COLUMBUS leads the horse away.CUT TO:EXT.  WATERMILL AND DAM UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DAYHarnessed, the horse pulls, with COLUMBUS and the MEN.
	The wheel is raised into position.CUT TO:EXT.  WATERMILL AND DAM - DAYWater thundering into the new canal.  The huge wheel
	begins to turn.  The MEN cheer and congratulate each
	other.  MOXICA looks at his mud-splattered and foaming
	horse, his eyes full of hatred.EXT.  CITY OF ISABEL - TWILIGHTA wide, high shot of the new "City", dominated by a huge
	wooden cross -- no more than a muddy main street bordered
	by a hundred bamboo and stone shanties, with candles
	burning in the doorways.  A main square with the
	Governor's Mansion, and the foundations of a church.

	In the twilight, COLUMBUS and the other WORKERS returning,
	dirty and tired.EXT.  VERANDA OF MOXICA'S HOUSE - TWILIGHTMOXICA and GUEVARA sit out on the "veranda", watching the
	MEN return.  MOXICA raises his glass in an ironic salute.MOXICATo the Governor of the Mosquitoes!

	They laugh.  We see the smoke and flames from a fire.
	Four or five INDIANS are squatting on the earth nearby,
	cooking for them, talking quietly in their own language.

	MOXICA calls out something in their language, and a naked
	YOUNG INDIAN GIRL comes out of the house, bringing more
	wine.  GUEVARA stares at her lasciviously.  MOXICA,
	letting his hand casually brush against her flank, smiles
	at him.MOXICADo you want her?

	He turns the GIRL round so that GUEVARA can admire her
	properly.  GUEVARA nods.  MOXICA lets the GIRL go with a
	peremptory order, and she disappears back inside.

	GUEVARA suddenly stands up -- unsteadily -- and sweeping
	his arm round in a broad gesture, says ironically:GUEVARATo the new world, my friend!  To the

	gusto.GIACOMO(as Nima pours the
				wine)
			Nima's a good cook!BARTOLOMEShe's more than that!

	Seeing GIACOMO'S sudden blush and discomfort, as NIMA
	smiles at him, the other BROTHERS laugh.

	To cover his embarrassment, GIACOMO returns to the topic
	of the food.GIACOMOWhat is it?COLUMBUSEat!  I'll tell you later.

	As he sees BARTOLOME stifling a laugh, GIACOMO pauses.GIACOMOI'd like to know what I'm eating.

	COLUMBUS eats a mouthful, glances at BARTOLOME.COLUMBUSIguana.

	A look of horror crosses GIACOMO'S face; he wretches
	slightly, puts down his fork, and gulps down some wine.
	The BROTHERS laugh again.COLUMBUSWhat wrong with it?  The Indians eat
			it!GIACOMOI'm not an Indian.BARTOLOMEHe wishes he were back in the

	Reluctantly this time, GIACOMO goes back to his dinner.EXT.  BALCONY - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHTThey are drinking and smoking cigars.  From the balcony
	they can see the dark mass of the jungle stretching away.
	GIACOMO is already dozing in his chair.  BARTOLOME sees
	it, and elbows COLUMBUS.  They both smile at their younger
	brother's exhaustion.  Then COLUMBUS gets up and leans on
	the balustrade, looking down at the city, the jungle
	beyond.COLUMBUSHow much gold have we found?BARTOLOMENot enough to justify a single

	BROTHER BUYL looks down at the body of a SPANIARD, covered
	in open sores.  The NOVICE joins him.BROTHER BUYLWhat kind of disease is this?DOCTOR CHANCAI don't know.  It seems almost as if

	It is a blisteringly hot day.  At the foot of the hill,
	GIACOMO sits at a table beneath an awning, with MOXICA and
	several CLERKS.  ONE HUNDRED FIFTY INDIANS standing in
	line at the table.

	In turn, they hand over a small quantity of gold.  The
	CLERK weighs it on a scale, and notes down each

	MOXICA impatiently gestures the INDIANS to move faster
	with a thonged crop.  An INDIAN approaches the table.  He

	the INDIAN WOMAN starts screaming and pushes back the

	to scramble to the front door, trying to put on his
	trousers.

	THE FOUR INDIANS catch him, and force him to lay on the
	ground.  THE MAN struggles, his eyes rolling in terror.
	TWO INDIANS force his mouth open.  A THIRD ONE kneels and
	starts stuffing it with gold dust.  THE SOLDIER chokes and
	suffocates.

	THE WOMAN still stands half naked against the wall,
	terrified.  AN INDIAN takes his knife from his leggings,
	slowly.  She starts sobbing and imploring in her language.
	THE INDIAN slowly walks to her, and plants the knife in
	the lower part of her belly.EXT.  MINE - DAYPAIRS of bloody red legs hanging still, high in the air.

	Pulling back, we discover:

	A DOZEN SPANIARDS have been crucified on the scaffolding
	of the excavations.  Some hands and noses have been
	removed.

	UTAPAN is standing, uncomfortable among the SPANIARDS.

	looks up at COLUMBUS for help in confusion.COLUMBUSYou have to find them, Utapan.  Look

	COLUMBUS is caught short.COLUMBUSWe have to stop this war.

	at them.  Two INDIANS try to run away.  They are shot.

	Watched by the other ARISTOCRATS, MOXICA sets fire to the
	parchment he has rolled up.  He blows the flames from the

	their heads.

	A crossbow arrow pierces the HALBERDIER.  Without a cry he
	falls forward into the water, and is carried away by the
	current.

	Two more MEN are hit.  One cries out, thrashes around in
	the water, an arrow protruding from his side.  The river
	stained with blood.

	Still no sign of the enemy.  COLUMBUS' MEN nevertheless
	start to return fire from the bank, creating a shield...
	others continue to wade across the river.  A MUTINEER is
	shot down from the branches of a tree...

	The first MEN come ashore.  Musket fire.  An exchange of
	arrows.  COLUMBUS is now wading across.  The MAN next to
	him is killed, and carried away by the current.

	Now, on the far shore, the enemy have shown themselves.
	There is hand to hand fighting, with swords and other
	weapons.  MOXICA kills one of COLUMBUS' men -- but his own
	are outnumbered and outmatched.  Already, some are
	beginning to surrender.

	In the midst of the fighting, COLUMBUS, sword drawn, pulls
	himself out of the river:  A MUTINEER lunges at him.

	being garroted -- his throat crushed with a rope.  The
	YOUNG MAN'S feet dance frenziedly.  We hear the choking.

	The drums cease.  BROTHER BUYL crosses himself and murmurs
	a prayer, deeply distraught.  GIACOMO has covered his
	eyes.

	COLUMBUS looks over his maps, trying to figure out where
	they are.  We see the outline of the continent of Asia.
	An OLD INDIAN squats beside him, silent, also looking at
	the map.  Then, slowly and very deliberately, he takes a
	piece of charcoal from the fire and begins to draw on the
	map.  Ignoring the Asian continent, he sketches the
	Panamanian coastline -- an isthmus.  MENDEZ and FERNANDO
	gather round.  COLUMBUS watches the OLD INDIAN with
	initial puzzlement, then growing excitement.MENDEZWhat's he doing?COLUMBUSHe's drawing an isthmus... He's

	The TRANSLATOR asks.  The OLD INDIAN shakes his head,
	laughs, points to the west, way beyond the other lakes,
	emphatically.TRANSLATORNo.  Says those are lakes.  Water on
			other side big -- as wide as here.
			Above and below, much land.COLUMBUS(stunned)
			An ocean...?  He's says it's an
			ocean?FERNANDOI don't understand.

	COLUMBUS is too stunned for a moment to explain.  The
	INDIANS laugh.

	Then COLUMBUS takes the charcoal, and begins to draw on
	the map, for his son.COLUMBUSHere is Europe... and over here, the
			continent of Asia.  But there's
			something in between!  Another
			continent!  We've found... another
			continent!

	FERNANDO stares west, then back at his FATHER.  COLUMBUS
	looks very feverish, his face bathed with sweat.FERNANDOFather...COLUMBUSThere must be a passage to that
			other ocean.CUT TO:INT.  SHIP - COLUMBUS' CABIN - NIGHTCOLUMBUS, feverish, lies on the bunk.  He shivers
	violently.  FERNANDO anxiously watches over him, bathes
	his eyes.

	Suddenly THE TRANSLATOR enters.TRANSLATORI help.

	A little reluctantly, FERNANDO lets him go to his FATHER.
	The INDIAN crouches over the bed, takes out a handful of
	leaves from a pouch.  He chews the leaves himself for a
	moment, until they form a sticky pulp, then opens
	COLUMBUS' mouth and puts the pulp inside, encouraging
	COLUMBUS to chew with the motions of his hands.

	COLUMBUS chews, quickly falling asleep.EXT.  MOONLIT VISION OF VAST LAND MASS - NIGHTWe see things from COLUMBUS' hallucination.  We are
	plunging through layers of clouds, the speed accelerating,
	giving us a sickening sensation of falling to land, closer
	and closer...

	COLUMBUS wakes up with a jolt.  Everything is silent.
	COLUMBUS walks outside.EXT.  DECK - NIGHTCOLUMBUS' fever has subsided.  He raises his head and
	stares at the mainland passing in the night.  He smiles.CUT TO:EXT.  JUNGLE AND BAY - HIGH WIDE SHOT - DAYThe roof of the jungle, the bay beyond, the caravel at

	THE SOLDIERS spread out into the empty village.

	FERNANDO, COLUMBUS and MENDEZ preceded by TWO ARMED
	SOLDIERS enter one of the huts.  The remains of a meal is
	still warm in bowls on the matted floor.

	A famished SOLDIER dips his hand in one of the bowls and
	devours its contents:  some kind of stew.  Stepping back
	accidentally, FERNANDO bumps into a large earthen jar
	behind him.  It rolls and crashes, revealing the remains
	of meat marinating in liquid.  There is something
	disturbing about the appearance of the content.FERNANDOOh my God...

	The remains of human beings.COLUMBUS(approaching)
			What is...?

	He stares at the remains, stunned.  THE SOLDIER stops
	chewing.  He drops the half-empty bowl he was still
	holding.  He runs at the back door, rams his fingers deep
	in the back of his throat, and vomits.SOLDIEROh Virgen Maria... Oh Madre de
			Dios...
			(Oh Virgin Mary... Oh Mother of
			 God...)

	But as he vomits and cries, he notices:

	A HEADLESS HUMAN TRUNK spread open, like a sheep carcass.
	Disturbed flies rise in clouds.SOLDIERJesus, Maria, y todos los Santos...
			(Jesus, Mary, and all the Saints...)CUT TO:COLUMBUS and the SPANIARDS meet in the center of the
	village.  All have made the same horrific discovery.COLUMBUS(urgently)
			Out!  Get out!

	THE SPANIARDS back out of the village, crossbows pointed
	at the invisible enemy hidden in the jungle.

	They are running through the dense forest for the river
	bank.

	The CANNIBALS materialize among the trees, running
	alongside.  Bounding, skipping, frightening FIGURES, their
	brutal faces painted in black.  They release arrows at the
	running SOLDIERS.  A SOLDIER stops, kneels to the ground,
	fires his crossbow and kills one of the CANNIBALS... but
	he is pierced by a spear.  TWO CANNIBALS drag him and cut
	his throat to finish him.ELSEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE -- CRIES AND CONFUSION, SPANIARDSand CANNIBALS moving in hand to hand combat.

	A CANNIBAL comes sprinting at FERNANDO, brandishing his
	lance.

	COLUMBUS jumps on the man, and plants a knife in his
	abdomen.  Blinded in sweat, he stabs the CANNIBAL, who
	collapses.  Frenzied, COLUMBUS stabs over and over again.

	He stops and looks at his forearm -- soaked in blood.
	Shocked by his own fury, he raises his hand and stares at
	it.

	A GIANT BLACK BUTTERFLY alights gently on his bloody
	fingers, COLUMBUS staring fascinated at its palpitating
	wings.  FERNANDO, screaming at his FATHER, drags him to
	his feet.  They run...CUT TO:THE SPANIARDS, COLUMBUS, MENDEZ, FERNANDO... all running
	hard to the boat.  ARROWS whistle around them as they leap
	into the canoes, nearly capsizing them, launching them
	into the current.

	SOME CANNIBALS still follow them along the riverbank.  But
	the canoes are faster, and soon, they are left behind.EXT.  SHIP AT SEA - DAYEndless seascape, the caravel plowing.EXT.  SHIP'S DECK - DAYFERNANDO is crouched on the poop deck, wrapped in a
	blanket.  He seems in a state of shock:  he is pale and
	shaking.  As COLUMBUS goes and sits near his son, he hands
	him a flask of alcohol.COLUMBUS(kindly)
			Take it.  Come on.  Drink.

	As COLUMBUS insists, brandishing the flask, FERNANDO
	notices that his hands are shaking too.  His FATHER'S
	forehead is dripping with sweat.

	FERNANDO drinks a gulp and grimaces.  He drinks again and
	hands the flask back to his FATHER, who does the same.
	FERNANDO notices dried blood on his FATHER'S fingers.
	COLUMBUS immediately hides his hand and stands.COLUMBUSI... I have to see Mendez.

	Then, with sudden anger.COLUMBUSYour brother was right.  I should
			have never taken you with me.  I'll
			never forgive myself.  Never!

	He walks a few steps, lurches, and has to lean against the
	rail.  He raises his hand to his eyes, grimacing in pain,
	as if they were burning.  FERNANDO scrambles to his feet
	and rushes to him.  COLUMBUS' eyes are already fixed
	somewhere -- fever is eating him up.COLUMBUSWill you ever forgive me?

	FERNANDO turns around for help.COLUMBUSCaptain Mendez!INT.  SHIP'S CABIN - DAYCOLUMBUS is lying on his couch.  FERNANDO is bathing his
	eyes, sweeping off the pus that continuously forms in
	them.  COLUMBUS is drenched in sweat.CUT TO:FERNANDO is writing under his FATHER'S dictation.COLUMBUSI came to Your Highness with honest

	We see a large amphitheater, filled with PEOPLE attending

	AROJAZ stands in front of the assembly.  Facing him,

	siesta next to his grapes.  He is sitting in a simple
	armchair, a rosary wrapped around his fingers.

	The presence of someone wakes him.  After a moment, he
	recognizes COLUMBUS and smiles.  Both MEN are very moved.MARCHENAI suppose we're both old men now.COLUMBUSYou'll always be older than me,
			Father.

	They laugh.  COLUMBUS sits down.  Bees drone lazily in the
	sunlight.COLUMBUSHave you ever forgiven me?

	MARCHENA nods his head.MARCHENAYes.  I forgave you a long time ago.
			You see, I was proud of you.  You
			were like a willful child.  You
			wouldn't accept what others told
			you.  You had to find things out for
			yourself, hurting yourself -- and
			others -- in the process.

	MARCHENA looks at his plants, sighs contentedly.MARCHENADo you remember when you said that
			people talk about the world, but
			never leave their gardens.

	COLUMBUS nods.MARCHENAMore than ever I wonder what it is
			we do achieve by leaving our
			gardens... The world changes -- and
			yet it seems the same.  We find new
			worlds, but fill them with the same
			people...

	He pauses, looks across at COLUMBUS, smiles again gently.
	MARCHENA, tiring, leans back in his chair, and looks up
	towards the sun.COLUMBUSI have to disagree.MARCHENAI knew you would.COLUMBUSNew worlds create new people.MARCHENAOh?  So you are a new man?COLUMBUSI don't know... I have the
			impression that I didn't change that
			much.  I still can't accept the

	MARCHENA starts laughing.MARCHENAGod bless you, and those like you!

	They both laugh.EXT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE BALCONY - EVENINGFERNANDO is sitting in front of his FATHER, examining
	documents and letters.  COLUMBUS has wrapped a shawl
	around his legs.  He looks even older now, with his mass
	of pure white hair.

	BEATRIX comes out with a tray, carrying grapes and a
	decanter of water.  She places it on a small table near
	COLUMBUS and touches his shoulder.

	As she is ready to return inside the house, he holds her
	back.COLUMBUSCan't you stay with us a little?BEATRIXI am busy inside.

	He smiles.  She looks at him smiling, intrigued.BEATRIXWhat is it, now?  Tell me...COLUMBUSI can't keep my eyes off you.  I
			would like to catch up with all the
			moments I didn't spend with you.

	FERNANDO looks up at them above his letters, amused and
	slightly embarrassed.  COLUMBUS looks at him with a fake
	air of reproach.COLUMBUSWhat are you listening to?FERNANDOI am not listening, Father.  But I
			can't help hearing.

	FERNANDO opens a letter and reads it quickly.FERNANDOIt's Diego... He is at the Court,
			with Santangel... He says they hope
			to get your privileges restored...
			And maybe the house.

	COLUMBUS smiles and nods -- all this seems to be of very
	little importance to him now.COLUMBUSBut how is he?  And Dona Maria?

	FERNANDO continues to read.FERNANDOFine, it seems.  Diego is thinking
			of starting a pearl trade, in Santo
			Domingo... He says he received many
			letters for you.  Some of your men,
			mostly.

	He opens one of them, glances at it.FERNANDOThis one is from Mendez!

	COLUMBUS' eyes brighten with joy.COLUMBUSWhat does he say?FERNANDOHe asks when he can come to visit

	COLUMBUS sighs, and leans back on his chair.  His eyes are
	fixed somewhere, searching.  Then, almost in a murmur.COLUMBUSI remember...

	We see the page.  FERNANDO writes: ... I REMEMBER...
