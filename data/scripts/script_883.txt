                         don't think she's so hot.STEW(disparaging gesture)Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures 
                         don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher,

                         I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.STEWGallagher! She's the real McCoy!? 22 ?GALLAGHERAnd the rest of us are truck horses?STEW(reproachfully)There you go, talking like a woman!GALLAGHER(a trifle resentfully)Well!STEWWell, you're my pal, aren't you? Then

                         has been regarding him with a curious 
                         expression. She loves being his pal, 
                         but wishes he would realize she is also

                         I'll give it back to you some time. 
                         Maybe.He flourishes the book of Conrad, which

                         the tip of her nose and tilts it up, 
                         studying the effect. Then, with a sigh

                         drapes aside. Then he crosses to a covered 
                         object and with a small flourish removes 
                         the cover - revealing a birdcage. He

                         Stew kicks back the covers and sits 
                         on the edge of the bed in his pajamas. 
                         Still sitting on the edge of the bed, 
                         he starts to slip his feet into a pair 
                         of slippers. The valet bends on one 
                         knee to help him.STEWThank you, thank you, thank you! I'll

                         him slip into it.STEWYes. I must have been pretty much plastered 
                         if I hired a valet.DAWSONOh, but you didn't engage me, sir.? 52 ?Stew, surprised, turns on him quickly.STEWWho did engage you then, if I didn't

                         the clothes that Stew has flung about.DAWSONOh, but indeed you do, sir, if you don't
