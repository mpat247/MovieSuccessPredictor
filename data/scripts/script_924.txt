                                       Ehren KrugerFADE IN:FIGURE IN A SANTA CLAUS SUITlies face-down in a nighttime expanse of snow. One of the 
               body's red-sleeved arms is twisted at a sickening angle. The 
               white snow beneath the figure is spreading with red.REVEAL EXT. SNOWY ROAD - NIGHTThe figure in the suit lies motionless. Snowflakes drift.INT. HALLWAY - NIGHTDark, rustic wood, an office with broken windows and whistling 
               winter beyond. A second BODY in a Santa Claus suit lies dead 
               in the doorway.

               It's a man with a large build. The suit is riddled with holes. 
               His face is missing.EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHTMore snow falling. A handful of cars in the lot. A third 
               BODY in the same red-and-white outfit lies atop the hood of 
               an old Pontiac. His head is not visible, having smashed 
               through the windshield. His suit is charred and blackened.

               A halo of broken glass outlines him. His black boots hang 
               off the front bumper. The parking lot is silent.INT. ROOM - NIGHTA floor scattered with shiny silver quarters. Reflections of 
               neon. There's a fourth SANTA here, face-down in a red pool. 
               The suit is far too big for him. Not that it matters now.EXT. SNOW-FILLED RAVINE - NIGHTwhere the fifth and final Santa lies at the edge of a ravine, 
               which plummets a hundred feet down. The man rests precariously 
               atop the slope, upside-down, eyes closed.

               His burned suit is smoldering. He has a sly but tired face, 
               late-20's, sandy hair, cold and scarred. This is RUDY DUNCAN.

               He opens his eyes.RUDY (V.O.)I never was much for the holidays.CUT TO BLACK:THE SOUND OF A WINTER WINDrises, as a TITLE appears: "SEVEN DAYS BEFORE..."

               where a handful of paper-cut snowflakes have been pasted.

               The sounds of YELLING INMATES and GATES slamming shut echo 
               through the fortress. Rudy watches a spider scurry across 
               the paper snow. It's his excitement for the day.

               He turns to the wall, where there's a photo of his teenage 
               self with some co-workers at an auto body shop. And a family 
               photo, cheery Midwesterners, with Rudy a scowling Artful 
               Dodger.A WALL CALENDARShows the dates have been crossed off up to December 18th.

               December 22nd is circled again and again.

               Rudy muses at the calendar, then hops out of his bunk. Drops 
               to the floor, crosses to a desk, finds a chewed-on pen. 
               Turning back to the beds we reveal --THE LOWER BUNKwhere Rudy's cellmate, NICK MASON (32), rugged, mustached 
               and well-built, sleeps soundly. In contrast, his bed-wall is 
               a COLLAGE OF PHOTOGRAPHS, twenty, maybe thirty of them. Almost 
               a mural.

               All of them photos of A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL, mid-twenties, 
               smiling out from beaches, parties and snowy scenes. Gorgeous 
               brown hair, heartbreaking smile. Effortlessly sexy.RUDYstares at the pictures for a moment, wistful. Nick snores, 
               turns over. Rudy climbs atop his bunk again, with the pen 
               this time. And crosses December 18th off the calendar.CUT TO:EXT. PRISON YARD - DAYThe two of them, Nick and Rudy, shivering by the fence. Nick 
               absently whistles some "Silver Bells," then digs for a smoke.NICKWhat's the first thing, man? What's

               Dozens of uniformed INMATES wander the yard, stamping feet, 
               hands tucked away, breath frosting. Nick tries to light his 
               cig, but the wind plays havoc. Nick curses, tosses it.RUDYHot chocolate.NICKWhat?RUDYGet a hot mug of chocolate.

               Nick laughs, stares through the fence at the gates of the 
               prison's entrance road. Longingly.NICKShe's gonna be out there, man. Right

                         that? Anything I want...RUDYYeah. Fuckin' Christmas.

               Nick grins. They stand there, shivering. It's freezing, but 
               the time they get outside is too precious to give up.RUDYAll those pictures she's sent... 
                         y'know... you sure they're all of

               They trail off in silence. Nick looks out at the prison road

               Nick's doing pushups on the floor below, smoking a cig, 
               reading sheets of pink stationery. With a new photo: of the 
               same GIRL, in a bikini by a lake. Vamping a childish pose.NICKSure as hell don't make me miss Millie

               Nick climbs off the floor, paces back to the bunks, marvelling 
               at the latest letter.RUDYWhat if she sees you, man, sees what 
                         you look like... and it's not there.

               Nick drops the page on his stomach. Rudy sighs, picks it up, 
               brings it to his nose.RUDYShe's using a new perfume.NICKNo, I think that's just oranges. She

               Nick drops back to his bunk, pasting the new lakeside photo 
               among his collage of pictures. Admiring his pen pal:NICKShoulda got yourself a girl.

               Above, Rudy peruses the page Nick gave him. Some lipstick 
               marks pressed to the paper. He passes it back, closes his 
               eyes.RUDYAll I want... is to make it to Sidnaw,

               There's the echo of CRASHING metal gates. Prisoners YELLING.

               line.RUDYShit. Alamo's back.

               Across Broadway, a parallel line is forming. A tall, tattooed 
               Native American, THE ALAMO, steps out of his cell. His hands 
               are the size of a man's skull.NICKDon't look like he missed the

               At that moment, Alamo glances over. Finds Rudy's eyes. Rudy

               Rudy stops. Slides back into the line of prisoners. Looks 
               across Broadway. The Alamo's walked on up ahead. Rudy 
               swallows, heads toward the mess hall.INT. MESS HALL - DAYA GLOOPY SPOON of CHUNKY RED AND GREEN JELLO gets splooshed

               taking his tray off the rail and turning --

               head. The cell block silent for the first time.

               Bootsteps from down the row. A SHADOW falls across Rudy's 
               somber figure. It's the Mean Guard. He stares at Rudy with 
               distinct pleasure.RUDYThe man had two days...MEAN GUARDWell. Least he won't be coming back.

               Rudy stumbles out with the group, shivering in a Goodwill 
               hand-me-down coat. Thin canvas, wouldn't keep him warm in 
               summer.

               Secondhand shoes. No possessions.

               He clutches his sides with his hands, hunched over. All

               fenceway.BEYOND THE GATEThere are a dozen FRIENDS and RELATIVES waiting. A few MEN, 
               several WOMEN, a couple KIDS. Bundled in winter coats, hats 
               and hoods. A prison shuttle bus is parked behind them.

               The released cons reach the gate, where a GATE GUARD unlocks 
               the fence to the outside world. Fifteen men are free.

               The ex-cons and relatives scan each other's faces. Wives 
               rush over to embrace their men. Pals nod to ex-cons and trade 
               slaps on backs. Reunion time.

               The snow batters them, wind whipping. Rudy keeps his head

               a seat at the back. A couple other lone ex-cons climb aboard. 
               Then the cons with relatives start to pile in.

               Rudy's window is steamed against the cold. He stares into 
               his lap, then reaches for his coat pocket. Takes out the 
               picture of Ashley, in her bikini by the lake. Stares at it.

               He rubs his window with his sleeve.

               Outside, the woman in the silver coat turns this way and 
               that, troubled. She's watching the other ex-cons climbing 
               onto the bus with their loved ones.

               The woman looks back to the prison. The guard closing the 
               gate. The steel door has been shut. No one else is coming.

               Rudy watches her sadly.

               Aboard the bus, the seats fill up. Ex-cons are feeling up 
               their wives, kids are climbing on their absent daddies, 
               buddies are jawing loudly 'bout how the neighborhood's 
               changed.

               The woman outside is now alone. Silver coat, pink poofball.

               Rudy looks at the bikini picture again.

               Then at the shivering bundle.RUDYDon't do it, Rudy...

               The bus ENGINE starts up. In the seat beside Rudy, an EX-CON 
               makes out with his WIFE while his bratty KID punches his 
               leg.

               Out the window, the young woman is scanning the bus windows. 
               Then the prison again. She turns in a worried circle. Rudy 
               looks swiftly away. Closes his eyes.RUDYDon't do it ...

               The bus door closes. It REVS and starts forward. Rudy sighs 
               with relief. The photo of Ashley falls to the floor.EXT. PRISON RELEASE GATE - CONTINUOUSThe young woman watches the bus pull away, down the snowy 
               road. But it doesn't get fifty feet before it suddenly stops.

               The door opens. And Rudy steps out.

               The bus REVS up again and GROANS OFF into the winter.

               The young woman pushes her poofball hat out of her eyes. We 
               get a look at her face for the first time. Skin pale, lips 
               turning blue, but it's the girl from the pictures. It's 
               Ashley.

               She watches Rudy's figure trudge back toward her. Snow 
               obscuring him until he's right in front of her. Both of them 
               shivering. Both of them standing there.

               Another awkward pause. Rudy picks up a milk dispenser beside 
               the coffee, puts it to his lips. It gives him a wide white 
               mustache. He stares straight-faced.

               Closer. It's a car's engine.

               Rudy spins for the source, focuses, and manages to make out

               a hundred feet down, kicking up geysers of snow!

               On the road, the Nova skids to a stop. Ashley and Gabriel

               and tangled, the rifle flying from Gabriel's grasp --TO THE BOTTOM-- where they come to a tangled, snowy halt. Gabriel struggles

               He extends a hand to Ashley --RUDYCome on.

               the two of them scramble away from the woods, Rudy with the 
               rifle, toward the meadow and its frozen pond.

               Rudy scrambles back, onto sturdy ice. He stares, stunned, at

               Then the highway. Safety within sight.

               But he can't run. Cursing himself, he grips the rifle tightly 
               and LEAPS into the ice-hole --EXT. RIVER BENEATH THE ICE-- plummeting underwater, the temperature hitting his body 
               like needles. He writhes, spinning around --

               the ice above her. Strength giving out.

               Rudy struggles to her, wrapping an arm around her. She fights, 
               panicked, clawing at the ice, both of them pulled further 
               away from the opening.

               With Ashley safely in hand, Rudy raises his rifle-arm, 
               pressing the barrel against the ice above them --

               Gabriel steps to the liquor cabinet, feels at the shelves. 
               They split in the middle. And there is a combination safe 
               mounted in the back. Gabriel turns to Jack Bangs:GABRIELOpen it.

               The two of them CRASH down, wrestling and rolling toward the 
               parking lot window. Two guns spill to the floor. Rudy grabs

               Before Merlin can make a move, Rudy fires --

               The Motor City Monster steams to a stop beyond the overlook.

               Ashley stares daggers. Shakes her head ruefully --ASHLEYMen.

               -- and pulls a handgun, SHOOTING Gabriel in the heart.

               Gabriel falls to his knees in the snow, his mouth a ring of 
               shock. Blood spurts through his red coat. He stares at Ashley, 
               incredulous.

               She steps forward and PUTS another bullet in his neck. Gabriel 
               falls still.

               Ashley's breath frosts in the cold.

               Rudy watches her. Finally, she meets Rudy's eyes. They stare 
               each other down for a long moment, before:RUDYWhere is he.

               A silence.

               No one moves.

               And finally, the CRUNCH of footsteps from around the side of

               A shadow moves across the snow behind the trailer, and soon

               It's Nick Mason.

               Alive and well.NICKMerry Christmas, Rudy.

               Ashley smiles. Her muscles-and-mustache man pen pal is here.NICKI missed you, beautiful.ASHLEYI missed you too, Nicky baby.

               They share a passionate kiss. Ashley malts at the sight of

               Ashley steps toward the ramp, taking out a matchbook. Nick 
               steps further into the trailer, to the back of the Nova.IN THE CARRudy immediately wriggles his hands, trying to touch his 
               wrists together. Trying to press together the white cuffs of 
               his Santa suit. Trying to get the right pressure point --

               -- as a BLADE suddenly springs out of the cuff! The

               As Ashley tosses her match onto the hood, and FIRE races

               Without a word, he stares at the food before him. And takes

               and sets it in front of him.

               And digs in. Stuffing his face in silence.
