          impersonated an airline pilot for
          Pan Am Airlines, and flew over two
          million miles for free. During that
          time I was also the Chief Resident
          Pediatrician at a Georgia hospital,
          the Assistant Attorney General for
          the state of Louisiana, and a
          Professor of American History at a
          prestigious University in France. By
          the time I was caught and sentenced
          to prison, I had cashed over six
          million dollars in fraudulent checks
          in 26 foreign countries and all fifty
           states, and I did it all before my
           18th birthday. To this day, I am the
           only teenager ever to have been placed
          on the FBI' s most wanted list.

          crawl across the prison floor.

          down and holding his gun against Frank's head --cocking the
