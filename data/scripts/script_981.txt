A strange,
    self-propelled motorized gurney whirrs into view and makes
    its way over a pedestrian crosswalk. The passenger, MARK
    O'BRIEN, in his early 30s, is visible only from the neck up.
    The rest of him is covered by a blanket. He operates the
    gurney with a mouth control and a set of mirrors positioned
    around his head.NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)Mark O'Brien has been going to UC
               Berkeley since 1978. That's O'Brien
               in the motorized gurney heading for
               class last week.

    The gurney continues along a leafy promenade on the campus.
    Passers-by just go about their normal business.NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)He had polio when he was 6 years
               old. The disease left his body
               crippled but his mind remained
               sharp and alert, and since he
               wanted to be a writer, Mark O'Brien
               entered Cal to major in English and
               learn his trade.

    THE SCENE CHANGES to the interior of a large auditorium. A
    graduation ceremony is in progress.  Suddenly, everyone in
    the hall, GRADUATES, their FAMILIES, ACADEMICS and OTHERS,
    rise to their feet as Mark, in his gurney, buzzes across the
    stage, a mortar board hung on one of the handles.1A.NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)And so, Mark O'Brien graduates from
Cal, one of 250 English majors to
receive degrees today.2.The DEAN steps forward, congratulates Mark and places a
     diploma on his blanket. The gurney makes its way across the
     rest of the stage to thunderous applause.

     reporter talks to camera.NEWS REPORTERIf this report tells us anything,
                it is that a disability is not
                necessarily a handicap.

     alley cat to the front of a modest, ground-floor apartment.
     It pauses, then slinks round the side, onto a ledge and in
     through a partially-opened window.INT.    MARK'S PLACE.    NIGHT3                                                                     3The cat comes through the window, hops onto the floor and
     quickly finds a nice little plate of food scraps that has
     been set out specially. As it settles down to its meal, we
     become aware of a heavy and regular sound, like a ship's
     pump, coming from somewhere close-by.

     In the center of the room is an object that looks like a prop
     from a `50s sci-fi movie. A human head protrudes from one
     end. The object is an iron lung, and its purpose is to keep
     its occupant, Mark O'Brien, breathing. Every 4.5 seconds, the
     pump mechanism creates a vacuum inside, forcing Mark's chest
     to expand and suck in air. He is fast asleep.2A.MARK (V.O.)Breathing
          Look you
          This most excellent canopy, the
          air,
          Presses down upon me
          At 15 pounds per square inch
          A dense, heavy, blue-glowing ocean.
          Teasing me with its nearness and
          immensity.
          And all I get is a thin stream of
          it.
          A finger's width of the rope that
          ties me to life.

Having now eaten its fill, the cat has a good scratch, then
wanders over to the iron lung.3.It hops up onto the small platform that supports Mark's head
    and slides itself along his face, once this way, once the
    other way, then jumps on top of the iron lung and walks its
    length. Through the portholes, we just make out the shape of
    Mark's bent, undersize body.  Suddenly, Mark's nose twitches.
    He opens his eyes and grimaces.MARKShit!

    His face continues to contort as he tries to cope with the
    terrible itching.  He shakes his head violently, then stops
    suddenly and closes his eyes. We hear his thoughts.MARK (V.O.) (CONT'D)Okay, just focus. Now, scratch
              with your mind, okay, your mind,
              scratch with your mind...

    After a couple more nose twitches, he settles down. It seems
    to have worked. In his peripheral vision, Mark can see the
    cat making itself comfortable in a corner chair, one of the
    only other pieces of furniture in the room. The first hints
    of dawn start to appear through the curtains. They
    illuminate a large framed portrait of the Virgin Mary hanging
    on the wall.   Mark acknowledges it.MARK (CONT'D)Good morning.

    Sunlight streams in, making the picture look truly sacred.EXT.   MARK'S PLACE.    DAY4                                                                 4JOAN, a solid but slovenly woman in her late 30s, walks up to
    Mark's front door, takes a key from her purse and lets
    herself in.INT.   MARK'S PLACE.    DAY5                                                                 5She comes in.JOANGood morning.

    Mark does not immediately acknowledge her.MARKYou're late.A LITTLE LATERThe center of the iron lung, basically a thin mattress, has
    been slid out, and Joan is in the process of giving Mark a
    bed bath. He is frail and helpless.4.There is a look of resentment in his eyes as this apparently
    unfeeling woman exercises total control over him, at least
    temporarily.MARK (V.O.)Joan
              I swear this was one crazy bitch
              Who'd swing me about enough to
              scare me,
              But careful enough so she could
              say:
              "Now what was all the yelling
              about? You polios are screamers.
              Always were."
              I didn't say a word, but typed my
              skinny novel in my head,
              And thought about revenge.

    In the course of washing his private parts, Mark has an
    involuntary erection. Joan gives him a shriveling look. He
    feels belittled and humiliated.A LITTLE LATERMark is on his side, his trousers are on and she is buttoning
    up a bright red shirt. It is an awkward business. They do it
    in silence, avoiding eye contact as much as possible.EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MARK'S PLACE.     DAY6                                                                 6Joan pushes Mark along in a gurney, similar, but slightly
    different from the one in the news clip. There are no mirrors
    and no motor, just an oxygen tank, a tube and a mouthpiece
    just next to Mark's mouth. Most of him is covered with a
    colorful blanket. The whole thing is a sports-coupe version
    of his iron lung.JOANWould you mind if I asked you a
              favor?MARKYou need help moving furniture?

    She has no apparent sense of humor.JOANI need an advance on my pay, like
              two weeks. That's not a big ask, is
              it?

    Mark looks rightfully shocked.MARKWhat if you don't last another two
              weeks?4A.He gives her a look, and means it. We hear his thoughts.MARK (V.O.) (CONT'D)Joan never failed to put me in a
          crappy mood. It was also a drag
          that I was no longer allowed to use
          my other gurney, the self-propelled
          one. It had caused a couple of
          spectacular accidents.

They turn a corner and approach a church.5.MARK (V.O.) (CONT'D)Basically, in spite of all the
                mirrors, I couldn't see where I was
                going.6A   EXT. CATHOLIC CHURCH.     DAY                            6AJoan pushes Mark's gurney into the sanctuary.INT.   CATHOLIC CHURCH.    DAY7                                                                 7FATHER BRENDAN is giving a sermon. Mark listens with
     satisfaction. There are not many others there.FATHER BRENDANThe Apostle Luke tells us that when
                Elizabeth spoke to Mary, the baby
                in her womb leapt - "For lo, as
                soon as the voice of thy salutation
                sounded in mine ears, the babe
                leaped in my womb for joy". So
                Mary's fear and apprehension slowly
                gave way to pride and purpose.
                Elizabeth saw the greatness in
                Mary. "Blessed art thou among
                women". Elizabeth, pregnant herself
                with St. John, felt the power of
                this wondrous woman. It was
                Elizabeth, and her absolute faith,
                that gave Mary the courage she was
                lacking, and she gave thanks
                saying: "My soul doth magnify the
                Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced
                in God my Saviour".

                May the spirit of the Lord be
                amongst you and remain with you
                always.


     Mass is over. PEOPLE come up to Mark and place a hand on his
     head or chest and say, "God bless you." In the background we
     can also hear Father Brendan.FATHER BRENDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)May the peace of the Lord be with
                you.PARISHIONERSAnd also with you.A LITTLE LATER5A.7A   INT. SIDE CHAPEL. DAY                                     7AMark waits alone in a tiny chapel off to the side of the
     church. He turns his head, takes a suck on the mouthpiece of
     his portable respirator, then looks around at the impressive
     stained glass windows. The expression on Mark's face is that
     of a true believer.MARK (V.O.)I'm definitely a true believer. But
               I believe in a God with a sense of
               humor. A wicked sense of humor. One
               who created me in His own image.

     Father Brendan enters. There is an awkward short moment when
     he realizes that there is no point in offering to shake
     hands. For no good reason, he nods instead.FATHER BRENDANHello. I'm Father Brendan. I don't
               think we've met.6.MARKNo, we haven't. I'm Mark O'Brien. I
          knew Father Seamus very well. I'm
          sorry that he's not here any more.FATHER BRENDANAs are many others. I'm going to do
          my best to fill his shoes. I
          understand you'd like me to hear
          your confession.MARKYes, I would. By the way, I enjoyed
          Mass. I liked your tone.

Father Brendan is not sure how to take this.FATHER BRENDANThank you.MARKYou don't believe absolute privacy
          is an essential part of the
          confessional, do you?FATHER BRENDANNo, I do not. I believe sincerity
          is the most essential part.MARKI told my attendant to come back in
          half an hour. Is that okay?FATHER BRENDANYes, take your time. I'm in no
          rush.MARKDid Father Seamus say anything to
          you about me?FATHER BRENDANNo one said anything to me about
          you.MARKI can be a bit time consuming, but
          I'm worth the trouble.

Father Brendan breaks a smile for the first time.FATHER BRENDANI'm here for you Mark.7.MARKLook, this is not exactly a
          confession. I haven't yet done the
          deed. I was hoping to sort of get a
          quote in advance.

Father Brendan sits down.FATHER BRENDANTell me what's on your mind.MARKThe most immediate thing on my mind
          would be my attendant, Joan. I'm
          thinking of getting rid of her.
          It's an evil thought, but I can't
          help it.FATHER BRENDANIs she dishonest, or incompetent?MARKNo, neither of those. She looks at
          me the wrong way. It's that you-
          need-me-more-than-I-need-you look.
          I'd like to show her she's wrong,
          just for the evil satisfaction it
          will give me. Is that a sin,
          Father?FATHER BRENDANWell, it obviously troubles you.MARKYes, it troubles me a lot. Because
          maybe it's really a power trip. Me
          against her. Me against the world.FATHER BRENDANI really wouldn't worry too much
          about that. The question is whether
          you like having her around.MARKI can't stand her.FATHER BRENDANThen get rid of her. If I were in a
          position to choose, I'd get someone
          nice. Even it was a power trip.MARKThen I have your blessing to fire
          her?8.FATHER BRENDANUnofficially, yes.MARKThat's good enough for me.FATHER BRENDANPlease, if ever you feel I can be
                  useful, do let me know. It was a

     the keys on an electric typewriter. At the other end of the
     stick, which is about a foot long, is Mark, manipulating it
     adeptly with his mouth. There is a white index card in the

     see the doorway. As a finishing touch, she dabs a little
     cologne behind his ears, then puts the mouthpiece of his

over and opens it. Silhouetted against the light is Cheryl
with a substantial bag. She could be the Avon lady. She has a
light blouse, light skirt and her long hair is loose.CHERYLHi, I'm Cheryl. I'm sorry I'm late.VERANo, that's fine. Come in. I'm Vera,
          I'm one of Mark's helpers.

face, just a smile.CHERYLHi, Mark O'Brien.

Vera is already at the front door.VERAI'll be back, say, in two hours?CHERYLYes, two hours, that would be

Mark blurts out.MARKYour money's on the dresser.

Cheryl walks over to the dresser. When her back is turned,
Mark screws up his face in self-disgust. She finds an
envelope.CHERYLThank you.

She puts it in her bag. Mark eyes her carefully.MARKThat was the wrong way to start
          off.33.CHERYLYes, it was. Shall we start again?MARKPlease, you start.

She sits down on the bed and looks at him. It is a very
frank stare. She is trying to take a lot in.CHERYLAlthough the aim is for us to have
          sex, I'm not a prostitute and you
          don't need to pay me up front. I've
          nothing against prostitutes, but
          there's a difference. We can talk
          about that later.MARKI'm sorry.CHERYLThe other thing is, there is a
          limit to the number of sessions we
          can have together. Did Laura
          mention that when you saw her?MARKI'm sorry, I don't remember.CHERYLThe limit is six. But that gives us
          plenty of opportunity to explore.

          have an erection.MARKYes, but not out of choice.CHERYLDo you know how many men there are
          on this planet who would give
          anything for a natural erection?

She looks around the room.CHERYL (CONT'D)Is this your place?MARKNo, it's a friend's. The only
          bedroom furniture I have at my
          place is an iron lung. I've
          sometimes thought about buying a
          futon, in case the need arose.CHERYLIt's worth thinking about.34.MARKI've got the space. It can be
          expensive though, a nice futon. I
          mean, how much do you think a good
          one would cost?CHERYLMark, just take a deep breath, then
          let go.MARKDo I seem anxious?CHERYLYou do a little.
Cheryl lies down beside him.CHERYL (CONT'D)Laura told me you were a poet.
          What's it like to be a poet?MARKIt's a way of living inside your
          own head, which is where I spend
          most of my time.CHERYLBut not today. By the way, I like
          your shirt.

He smiles, genuinely flattered.MARKThank you.CHERYLSo I need to ask you some basic
          questions. Okay?MARKSure.CHERYLWhat is the iron lung for?MARKIt keeps me breathing. I can spend
          a few hours outside of it, with my
          portable respirator, depending on
          how I feel. But I work and sleep in
          the iron lung.34A.CHERYLHow do you feel right now?35.MARKOut of my league.CHERYLI meant your breathing.MARKOh...fine. In fact, better than
          usual.CHERYLThat's great. Do you have any areas
          of unusual sensitivity? Any parts
          of your body you don't want me to
          touch?MARKI have normal sensitivity all over.
          It's just that my muscles don't
          work. You can touch me anywhere.CHERYLShall we get undressed then?


Mark is taken by surprise by the suddenness of it. He
hesitates momentarily.MARKSure.

Cheryl starts to unbutton his shirt. Mark's terror is visible
in his eyes and she can also feel his heart palpitating. She
starts to slowly extract one of Mark's arms from his shirt-
sleeve. Suddenly, he lets out a piercing scream.MARK (CONT'D)Ow! Ow! Stop! It hurts!

She recoils, shocked.CHERYLWhat's wrong?MARKHoly Mother of God!CHERYLTell me what's wrong.MARKMy fingers! They're caught!

She discovers that his fingers have been snagged in the
fabric of the shirt and his fingers are being bent backward.36.CHERYLOkay, okay, I've got it. Don't
          worry.

She carefully frees his fingers and eases the sleeve off.MARKBe careful, please.CHERYLMark, I'm going to be really
          careful with you. I don't want to
          hurt or injure you in any way, but
          it's really not sexy when you yell
          at me. Okay?MARKI won't yell at you any more.CHERYLBut you'll tell me calmly the
          moment anything starts to hurt?MARKYes.CHERYLNow, let's do the other arm.

Little by little, she extracts the other arm. He grimaces his
way through it, but more in fear than in pain. She finally
sets his shirt down on the end of the bed.CHERYL (CONT'D)Nice shirt.MARKYou already said that.CHERYLDid I? I guess I'm a little
          anxious, too.

She undoes the top of his pants.CHERYL (CONT'D)Okay, I'm going to slide these

     Cheryl continues undressing, Mark looks away.CHERYLOkay, the difference between me and

     She stands there for a few moments, but he keeps his eyes
     averted. She turns back the sheets, gets into bed beside him
     and he finally looks at her.MARKWhenever I'm naked, everyone else

                parents, would intervene to keep
                this moment from happening.

          feels ticklish or bothers you, let

She strokes his hair.CHERYL (CONT'D)You have soft hair. It's nice to
          the touch. So you like it?MARKI do.

She moves her fingers round behind his ear, then the front of
his ear.MARK (CONT'D)That feels weird.CHERYLWeird good? Or weird bad?MARKJust weird.

She moves her hand down his neck.MARK (CONT'D)Good.

exercises?38.CHERYLYou're clever to have worked that
                out.

     are a little like shock waves.MARKPeople tell me I'm very perceptive.CHERYLWould you like to see what I feel

      Giants' game. Mark is engrossed. Suddenly the broadcast
      stops. The digital read-out on the clock radio, which says
      12:57, disappears. A street light, visible through the
      window, goes out. The electric pump under Mark's iron lung
      whirrs to a halt. We hear the sound of air escaping, then an
      eerie silence. Even the cat is motionless.

      For a few moments, Mark seems hypnotized. Then, he twists his
      head and clamps onto his mouth stick. He manoeuvres it over
      to the speaker button on the phone and manages to press it in
      the semi-darkness. We hear a dial tone.INT.   ROD'S BEDROOM.    NIGHT154                                                            154There is an answering machine on a bedside table.ROD'S VOICEHi, this is Rod. Leave a message,

      He swings the mouth stick over to the 9 button. As he presses
      it, he loses his grip and the mouth stick falls to the floor.MARK (CONT'D)Shit!

      At first, he seems panicky, but after a few moments he begins
      to control his breathing and gradually psyches himself into a
      strange calm.MARK (CONT'D)So this is how it ends.

      The room is dominated by a small, beautifully tiled immersion
      pool with a hand rail and steps. The MIKVAH LADY gets up from
      her chair and approaches her.MIKVAH LADYIs this your first time?CHERYLYes, it is. I'm converting.

      She takes off her robe and hands it to the Mikvah Lady, who
      does not fail to notice Cheryl's body.MIKVAH LADYSo, what do you do?

      Cheryl steps towards the pool.MIKVAH LADYI see you're very comfortable with

                 the walls or anything.

      She immerses completely. We see her under the water. She
      hears a voice in the distance, her own voice. At the same

      A few feet in front of Mark, Cheryl is holding a full-length
      mirror. The angle is such that he can see all of himself. He
      is mesmerized by his own image. Flashes of light from the

      cocoon over him in place of his iron lung. There is a

                 don't go near the light.SUSANIs that what you remember?MARKNo. I assume I passed out. Before
                 that, I remember feeling sorry for
                 myself.SUSANDo you feel relieved now?MARKNo. I mean, I'm relieved that Rod
                 got to me in time, but I still feel
                 sorry for myself.SUSANI'm sure there's a cure for that.

                 for me right now. My priest
                 couldn't.SUSANAre you religious?MARKYes. I would find it absolutely
                 intolerable not to be able to blame
                 someone for all this. Are you?SUSANNo, I don't go to any church and I
                 don't think about God very much.
                 But I believe there's a mysterious
