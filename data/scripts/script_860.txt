                                 Jon SpaihtsFADE IN:EXT. INTERSTELLAR SPACEA million suns shine in the dark.
          A STARSHIP cuts through the night: a gleaming white cruiser.
          Galleries of windows. Flying decks and observation domes.
          On the hull: EXCELSIOR - A HomeStead Company Starship.
          The ship flashes through a nebula. Space-dust sparkles as it
          whips over the hull, betraying the ship's dizzying speed.
          The nebula boils in the ship's wake. The Excelsior rockets
          on, spotless and beautiful as a daydream.INT. STARSHIP EXCELSIOR - GRAND CONCOURSEA wide plaza. Its lofty atrium cuts through seven decks,
          creating tiers of promenades framing a vast skylight.
          The promenades are empty. Chairs unoccupied. Beetle-like
          robots vacuum the carpets and wax the floors.CAFETERIASuper-modern and gleaming. Hundreds of tables, all empty.FORWARD OBSERVATION DECKLounge furniture and star-filled windows. Completely
          deserted. A robot on spindly legs washes the glass.HIBERNATION BAYEndless corridors lined with vertical glass tubes. Inside
          each tube stands a PASSENGER. Eyes closed in sleep. If
          they're breathing you can't tell by looking.
          They sleep on their feet, leaning against padded supports.
          Straps secure them in place; sensors adhere to their skin.
          They wear shorts and tank tops with HomeStead Company logos.
          We survey their faces. No children, no senior citizens. Men
          and women of every ethnicity in the prime of their lives.
          We settle on one man. JIM PRESTON, 38. Sound asleep. A small
          display on his pod reads:JAMES PRESTONRate 2 Mechanical Engineer

                        Passenger class: silverFARE: ONE-WAYA deep BOOM. Echoes roll down the corridors.
          Lights wink on in Jim's hibernation pod. Machinery hums to
          life. Instruments beep and chitter.
          Medical data fills the pod's screen. Jim's temperature rises.
          His heart begins to beat. He takes a breath.
          Jim opens his eyes.
          Groggy, blinking, seeing nothing.
          The backrest behind him converts into a recliner, lowering
          him into a seated position.
          The sensors on his skin drop off and snake back into the
          pod's machinery.
          A video screen descends before Jim's eyes.

          She makes it sound sexy. Jim scowls and rubs his eyes.

          takes his pills and gulps his juice with a grimace.

          revealing a Homestead Company bathrobe and slippers.VIDEO STEWARDESS (CONT'D)Make yourself comfortable in your

          He shuffles down the corridor in his slippers, rubbing his
          face. Having trouble keeping his eyes open.
          Behind him, his pod closes up. Its screen reads PASSENGERDISCHARGED.ELEVATOR FOYERJim finds a bank of elevators. As he approaches, the

                    prepare for your new life on

          screen, and the presentation's running there too.ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (CONT'D)Passengers are organized into

          The DOORBELL rings.
          Jim opens the door eagerly - and deflates. No one there.
          He looks down. A waist-high CARGO ROBOT peers up at him with
          goggle eyes. It carries two suitcases and a duffel bag.CARGO ROBOTPassenger James Preston?JIMJim. Yeah.CARGO ROBOTYour luggage, Passenger Jim. Swipe

          The robot zips out the door.

          But it's just a window-washer: a robot with long spindly
          limbs. It moves past Jim, polishing windows. Oblivious.

          slippers. He looks shell-shocked.
          He comes to the Concourse Bar: the fanciest watering hole on
          the ship. Black leather stools along a marble bartop.
          Jim touches the bartop...and a MAN swings up behind the bar -
          as if mounted on a hinge. A handsome fellow in a bartender's
          uniform - his hair and skin eerily perfect. This is ARTHUR.

          movement, he glides the length of the bar, polishing all the
          way, and glides back as if on roller skates.
          Jim steps up on the footrail and peers behind the bar.

          He finds a room marked EMERGENCY GEAR and opens it eagerly.
          It's full of space suits and oxygen tanks.
          He peers into a red HAZARD cabinet: fire extinguishers, an
          axe, an epoxy foamer for atmosphere leaks - all behind glass.
          He opens another door marked EMERGENCY MANUALS - and smiles:
          shelf after shelf of waterproof, fireproof technical manuals.
          Jim pulls a manual labeled HIBERNATION SYSTEMS.INT. SUBDECK B - PASSENGER CARGO STOWAGE - DAYA cavernous cargo hold. Jim drives a forklift down the aisle,
          scanning container numbers.

          PRESTON." The forklift pulls it from the rack.18.THE CARGO CONTAINEROpens to reveal Jim's belongings. Cartons marked "sports" or
          "clothes" or "kitchen stuff."
          Amidst the cartons, a heavy-duty TOOLBOX. Jim hauls it out.HIBERNATION BAYJim sits in front of his empty hibernation pod. His toolbox
          beside him. The Hibernation Systems manual lies open.
          Jim tinkers with the electronics inside his pod.
          The pod hums to life. Its data screen flickers with
          information. Mysterious WHIRS and THUNKS.
          The canopy opens.
          Elated, Jim bounces to his feet. Strips off his shirt and
          scrambles in. The canopy closes over him.
          He assumes the position, his back against the backrest,
          waiting for the pod to put him to sleep.
          Nothing happens. He pokes at the ports where the sensors and
          intravenous lines used to protrude. Shakes the machine.
          He gives up. It's not working.
          But now he's trapped inside the pod.
          He pushes at the canopy, but it's locked shut. He pounds on
          the glass with no effect. Finally he loses it, shouting and
          stamping, hammering and raging - all muffled behind glass.
          Exhausted, he sinks to the floor of the pod, staring out at
          his tools and his manual, his discarded shirt.
          Then he notices the emergency release handle down by the
          floor. He pulls it, and the canopy pops open.OUTSIDE THE PODThe pod's display screen blinks back to its original message.PASSENGER DISCHARGED.CREW HIBERNATION FACILITY DOORJim looks through the porthole at the sleeping crew.

          fly. He's drenched in sweat. Mussed and unshaven.
          He lifts the goggles and inspects the door. The laser cutter
          has barely marked the surface.
          The door's a mess. Its switch hangs on wires. There are pry
          marks around the latch. Gouges around the window. Failed
          drill holes. Dents left by an axe.
          But the door stands firm.
          Jim lets the laser cutter fall. It joins a scrapyard of tools
          on the floor: sledgehammer, jackhammer, drill, crowbar, axe.HIBERNATION BAY - JIM'S PODAnother debris field surrounds Jim's hibernation pod. Tools
          and cables, electronic instruments, a diagnostic laptop.

          sweaty and grimy, a whiskey in front of him.

                    snap your fingers and be wherever you

                    else. That's not a crisis, it's the
                    human condition.
          Jim takes a moment to consider that.JIMThat's not me.ARTHURWell, maybe not. The point is, you
                    can't get so wrapped up in where
                    you'd rather be that you forget to

          He pulls back the curtain, sits in the booth. The curtain

                    wouldn't be alone anymore, but you'd
                    be stranding another person on the
                    island. Would you make the wish?ARTHURI don't know. I've never been on an
                    island.JIMOkay. Say you figured out how to do
                    something that would make your life a
                    hundred times better. But it's wrong,
                    and there's no taking it back. How
                    wrong would it have to be to stop
                    you? I mean, what if it made your
                    life a thousand times better? How do
                    you do the math?ARTHURJim. These are not robot questions.
          Jim stares at Arthur in frustration.JIM(spelling it out)

                    use some company.32.JIMI'd be stranding her on this ship for

          Jim buries his face in his hands.JIMWhat am I going to do?ARTHURJim. I'm here for you.JIM(LOOKING UP)Arthur, you're a machine.
          Jim hauls the manual off the bartop and stalks away.EXT. STARSHIP EXCELSIORThe ship forges through space, its lit windows shining.
          Jim paces back and forth on a promenade, a tiny figure
          dwarfed by the mighty ship and the tapestry of stars.DECK TWO - HALL OF FAITH - DAYJim passes under a sign reading "Hall of Faith," into a
          circular walk.
          There's a small fountain in the middle of the circle. Around
          the edges, doors labeled: BUDDHISM, JUDAISM, HINDUISM,CHRISTIANITY, ISLAM, OTHER FAITHS.Jim walks the circle, looking through the doorways: a cross,
          a Buddha, an abstract sculpture in the "Other Faiths" chapel.
          He continues around the circle and out into the ship.DECK FOUR - STARBOARD E.V.A. ROOMJim opens a door marked "Starboard E.V.A. Room - No
          Passengers Beyond This Point!"
          The E.V.A. Room is dominated by an airlock. Spacesuits in
          racks. Tools, tethers, shuttle docking rings.
          Jim goes to the airlock. Opens the inner door.
          A BUZZER sounds a warning.33.He steps into the airlock. The door closes behind him.
          Jim looks at the red lever that opens the outer door. He
          grips the lever. Looks thoughtfully out at the stars.EXT. STARSHIP EXCELSIOR - STARBOARD AIRLOCKThe airlock outer door opens with a blast of air. Jim emerges
          from the airlock - wearing a SPACE SUIT.
          He plants his feet on the hull and walks up the side of the
          ship on magnetic boots.ATOP THE SHIPJim walks forward across the giant skylight.AT THE BOWJim stands, face uplifted. The cosmos reflected in his visor.

          He finds a squadron of housekeeping robots waiting outside.
          He taps the "PLEASE SERVICE" button beside his door.
          The robots zoom inside with squeals of joy.HIBERNATION BAY - AURORA'S PODJim stands in front of Aurora: toolbox in one hand, the
          technical manual in the other. He's breathing hard.
          He sets the toolbox down. Opens the manual. It's densely
          annotated in Jim's handwriting.
          He opens the pod's cover panel and goes to work, following
          the steps in his manual. His hands shake.
          He starts to close a final contact.
          Stops.
          Gets to his feet. Stands looking at Aurora.
          Quickly he kneels and completes the circuit. Pulls his hands
          away as if the metal had burned him.JIMOkay.
          Aurora's pod hums. Medical data flows across its screen. Her
          vital signs re-start. Her pale skin flushes with color.
          Jim beats a retreat.AURORA'S PODAurora's perfect lips part. She takes a shallow breath - and
          then a deep one. Her chest rises and falls.
          Her thighs shift as she bends her knees. The sensors on her
          body drop off and withdraw into the pod.
          She opens her eyes. They're beautiful.
          Her pod's backrest flexes, scooping up her knees as it
          becomes a seat. A video screen drops in front of her.35.VIDEO STEWARDESSGood morning, Aurora!BERLIN SUITEThe luxury cabin now tidy and immaculate.
          Jim bursts in, wild-eyed. Drops his toolbox. Hides the marked-

          Jim runs down six flights of stairs, his heart in his throat.
          He reaches the Grand Concourse out of breath. He stops a few
          paces away, just looking at Aurora, getting his wind back.AURORAPassenger or crew?JIMPassenger. Jim Preston.
          He sticks out a hand. She shakes it firmly. Electric for Jim.
          First contact.AURORAI'm Aurora.
          Jim's lips move as she speaks her name, almost saying it with
          her. Aurora. She doesn't pick up on it.AURORA (CONT'D)Do you know what's happening? Nobody
                    else in my row woke up.JIMYeah, I...same for me.AURORAThe crew's supposed to wake up a

          Jim swallows hard.JIMThe crew's still sleeping. They've
                    got a special facility. I can see
                    them in there but I can't get in.

          watching the floors go by.AURORATypical. There's so much incompetence
                       in these big companies. No

                       apologizes. Nobody even feels bad.
          Jim is only half listening - his eyes drawn to the spill of
          her hair over her neck, the line of her jaw.AURORA (CONT'D)It's the corporate mentality.

                    you'll need oven mitts to read it.
                    Trust me.JIMIt's not that simple. Putting
                    somebody into hibernation takes
                    special equipment. Remember the
                    facility where they put us to sleep?
          Jim points at a pod beside them. A middle-aged woman inside.JIM (CONT'D)This pod will keep her in hibernation
                    as long as you want. And it can wake

          Aurora covers her mouth. Her eyes full of horror.AURORAOh, my God. No.
          She turns her back. Suddenly she walks briskly away. And
          breaks into a run. Jim watches her go, astonished.
          After a moment he runs after her.HIBERNATION BAYAurora runs down a row of hibernation pods, her eyes
          searching wildly among the glass tubes. She turns a corner.
          Hesitates. Runs down another row. She's fighting tears.
          She puts on speed. Her sash unknots itself and her robe
          billows behind her.IN ANOTHER ROWJim jogs along, worried. He's lost her. He pauses, listening.
          In the distance, slippered feet. He runs that way.
          He stops: the sash of Aurora's robe lies on the deck. He
          picks it up. Runs on.JIMAurora!
          He turns another corner and sees her. She's sitting down, her
          back against a hibernation pod. Laughing at her own tears.AURORAI can't even find the one I'm
                    supposed to be in.
          Jim extends a hand. She lets him pull her to her feet. He
          gives her the sash, and she ties her robe around her.AURORA (CONT'D)Thanks.
          Jim looks back at her, miserable with guilt.JIMI shouldn't have told you like that.41.AURORANo, I'm sorry. It just hit me how
                    serious this is. How did you wake up?JIMI just did. I woke up, my pod dumped

          brings up his account information.JIMI've sent...sixteen messages to

                    farther away. We'd die of old age

          through cabinets full of medicines and instruments.48.She opens a steel vault. A deep freeze: icy vapor rolls out.
          Inside: racks of steel capsules at subzero temperatures.
          She leans close: each frosted capsule is labeled with a
          passenger's name and the word SPERM or OVA.CREW HIBERNATION FACILITY DOOR - EVENINGAurora frowns through the window at the sleeping crew.
          A litter of tools still surrounds the battered door. Aurora
          snatches up a crowbar and bashes the porthole. The bar spins
          from her stinging hands, but the window's not even marked.ELITE DECK - ELITE PROMENADE - EVENINGJim sits at a table with his tools, struggling with a high-
          tech mechanism.
          Aurora drops into a chair across from him. He looks up. Takes
          in her condition: weary and frustrated.AURORAThere's no way we're going to build a
                    hibernation machine.JIMNo.AURORAAnd there's no magic sleeping drugs

                    doesn't need one; she just needs a
                    way with words and an attitude. I'm

          deserted. Aurora is all curiosity.
          Suddenly Arthur appears, doing his swinging-up-on-hinges

          in quite those words.AURORA (CONT'D)A hundred and twenty years'
                    hibernation means you never see your

                    your way to another planet and

                    know these people.
          Jim walks up to a hibernation pod. Glances at the data

                    So. What is there to do around here?MOVIE THEATER - DAYJim leads Aurora into the movie theater. The lights come up.
          The curtain opens. Aurora looks around in wonder.
          A bundle of cables snakes down the aisle.JIMWatch your step. I've made a few
                    changes.
          Next to Jim's favorite seat there's a cluster of machines
          with power cables and hoses running to them.
          Jim and Aurora sit. A screen beside Jim lists movies.JIM (CONT'D)I got tired of running up to the
                    projector room, so I moved the

                    movies to choose from. I've only
                    watched about five hundred of them.
          He taps a button on another machine, which produces a bucket
          of hot popcorn. He offers Aurora some.JIM (CONT'D)Popcorn?
          Aurora grins and takes some.60.GYMNASIUM - BASKETBALL COURT - DAYJim and Aurora play one-on-one. She's not especially good,
          but fiercely competitive. They jostle and scramble, laughing.
          Aurora snags the ball. For a minute she just stands there,
          beaming.JIMWhat are you so happy about?AURORAI'm up two points!
          She cuts around him toward the basket.DECK TWO - VIRTUAL MUSEUM - EVENINGJim and Aurora walk through the museum's white rooms. The
          walls display a Jackson Pollock collection.
          Aurora goes to the control podium. Scrolls through the menu,
          covers her eyes and chooses blind.
          The wall panels fill with Heironymous Bosch paintings -
          medieval visions of Hell. She winces and chooses again. A
          somber collection of portraits by Dutch masters. She frowns.
          Jim steps to her side and makes a selection.
          The walls fill with abstract landscapes - stark plains and
          oceans, with lonely figures isolated in the vastness.
          The images pull Jim and Aurora in: they stand before a dark
          seascape.
          Without thinking she reaches out and tucks her hand in the
          crook of his elbow.FADE TO BLACK.SUPER: ONE MONTH LATERSWIMMING POOL - MORNINGAurora swims laps, cutting through the water.

          of him but doesn't let on.
          Underwater she smiles.61.DECK THREE - SHOPPING DISTRICT - MORNINGA cleaning robot scurries along the shopping street, looking
          for spots to polish.

          Beside him on the floor, his kidnapped cleaning robot does a
          figure-eight. Jim smiles in satisfaction.FORWARD OBSERVATION DECK - DAYAurora sits in her habitual writing position: cross-legged on
          her favorite sofa, her writing slate in her lap.AURORAThe starship's designers gave the
                    ship a daily rhythm. The light is
                    warm in the morning, bright during
                    the day, cool at night. We need those
                    changes. But I miss other rhythms.
                    There are no holidays here. Every day
                    is a day of leisure. There are no

          A mechanical whir distracts her. She looks down.
          Jim's pet robot looks up at her with binocular eyes. It
          carries a note in a clip on its back. Aurora pulls it free.

          Aurora laughs.
          Beside the note-clip, the robot carries a pen in a makeshift

          written in bold letters:

          jewelry, her hair up. She looks like a goddess.
          The doorbell rings. She answers it.
          Jim stands on her doorstep in a black jacket, looking dapper.

          Jim walks onto the dance floor. Holds out his hand to Aurora.
          She comes to him, and they dance. They're pretty good. Smiles
          grow on their faces.
          Jim spins her out, spins her back - close enough to kiss.
          They almost do - but they don't.DECK THREE - SHOPPING DISTRICT - NIGHTJim and Aurora ride along on the cargo robot. Her head rests

          She pulls him to the photo booth. They tumble inside. As the
          strobe flashes, she kisses him hard.
          Outside, the photo strip drops into the tray: four color
          pictures. In the first they laugh; in the second they clown;
          in the third, they kiss. In the last image, Aurora smiles at
          the camera; Jim looks at Aurora.

          A passing robot pauses to observe the scene - then moves on.SERIES OF SHOTS1. Jim and Aurora make out fiercely in the movie theater
          while a movie plays onscreen.

          moves against him: she's close. She climaxes gorgeously.
          3. Jim stands on a promenade. Aurora passes, jogging. He
          gives her a smile as she goes by. A moment later she runs

                    Tradition? The wish for something

          Jim opens cargo containers. He finds ingots of metal,

          Giving in, she begins to explore Jim's possessions: poking
          into the drawers of his nightstand and dresser.
          She opens his closet. Shifting things, she finds a dog-eared
          manual on hibernation pods. She pulls it out.
          There's a bookmark in the pages. She goes to open the book -
          and the bookmark slides into her hand.
          It's the photo strip Jim took during his isolation: Four
          identical shots of his face, bearded and hollow-eyed. The
          melancholy images hit her hard.
          She touches the pictures to make them move: but Jim sits
          immobile. In the fourth image, he sighs heavily.

                    But it's also a prison. I'm moving at

          The deep RUMBLE is louder. A bloody light fills the sky.
          A STAR looms ahead of the ship: a RED GIANT. The Excelsior
          rockets toward the star.
          The passage takes less than a minute. The Red Giant swells in
          the windows. The ship shudders. The engines howl. Aurora
          falls into Jim's arms. The ship bathed in red light.
          The star fills the skylight, fills the sky itself. A fiery
          surface turbulent with sunspots and mysterious currents. The
          engines howl.
          And then they're past. The star recedes, dwindling as quickly
          as it grew. The engines quiet. The ship's calm restored.AURORA(BREATHLESSLY)That was incredible.JIMClosest we'll get to a star on the

          Gus waves and walks off. That leaves Jim and Aurora sitting
          awkwardly on the same side of a diner booth.
          After a moment Aurora moves over to the other side. Looks at
          Jim across the table.AURORA (CONT'D)Six hundred years old!JIMI've missed you.
          Aurora stares, caught off guard. She gets up.AURORASee you in the morning.COMMAND DECK - DIAGNOSTIC CENTER - MORNINGGus and Jim examine the Diagnostic Computer. Jim holds a

          Jim puts the pedal down. The cart lays rubber on the deck
          plates and shoots down the aisle while Aurora and Gus yell.SHIP'S STORESUp on a hydraulic lift, Gus digs components out of storage.
          Hands them to Aurora, who hands them to Jim, who loads them
          into the cart.95.DIAGNOSTIC CENTERGus works on the Diagnostic Computer while Jim looks on.

          Gus clamps a final component in place and nods at Jim.GUSStart `er up.
          Jim closes a circuit breaker and powers up the computer. A

          The screen flashes a message: RUNNING VESSEL DIAGNOSTIC. A
          progress bar shows that the diagnostic is 0.0% complete.

          cups of coffee, and hands her one. Aurora smiles, touched.AURORAThank you.
          Gus arrives in a fresh coverall, a steaming mug in hand. No
          signs of frailty. He hands each of them a digital slate.GUSAll right. Last night I checked ten
                    atmosphere stations and two of them

          symptoms. He stares, astonished.GUSSon of a gun.
          A sound behind him. Gus turns to find Jim watching. He looks

                    I was sixteen I lied about my age and
                    got onto a lunar shuttle crew. A few
                    years later I moved on to planetary
                    ships. Made the Venus run a hundred
                    times, then Jupiter and Saturn. Then
                    the gravity drive came along. Real
                    spaceflight. I did everything I could
                    to get onto an interstellar ship. I
                    was thirty-six years old the first
                    time I saw an alien sun. No going
                    back after that. I've walked on

          Gus extends a hand to Aurora. She throws her arms around him.AURORAGus. I can't stand it. There's got to
                    be some other way. Don't do this.
          Gus gently frees himself from her arms.GUS(TENDERLY)It's all right, Aurora. It's all
                    right.
          Gus turns to Jim. They clasp hands. Slap each other's
          shoulders in a rough embrace.GUS (CONT'D)Jim. Fix the ship.JIMYes, sir.GUSAnd take care of each other.
          Gus turns and opens the airlock. He straightens, squares his
          shoulders, and steps inside. Turns to face them.GUS (CONT'D)All right.
          Aurora covers her mouth. Jim raises a hand in stunned
          farewell. The airlock door closes. Red lights flash.
          Through the porthole they see Gus look out into space.
          Then the outer door slams open and a blast of air shoots Gus
          out among the stars. His body lost in the infinite night.
          Aurora steps into Jim's arms. Lays her head on his chest. For
          a moment he holds her. Then she pushes him gently back. Meets

          clings in the gale-force wind, grimacing in pain.111.There's a RAGGED HOLE punched in the hull. Outside, stars

          Jim pulls a HAMMER from his belt and jams it crossways in the
          doorway, propping open the door. The door's motors whine.
          Jim dives inside. Skids to a stop beside Aurora. Pulls her
          loose from the column and shoves her toward the door,
          fighting the wind.
          Aurora scrambles through the doorway. Jim tries to follow -
          but the hammer suddenly bends and springs out of the doorway.
          The door slams: Aurora outside, Jim in the airless room.
          The last of the atmosphere flashes away into space.
          Aurora screams and pounds on the other side of the door. But
          Jim hears only his own thudding heartbeat.

          The air jets stop. The wind dies as the air escapes.
          Jim lunges back to the open drawer. Pulls the LASER CUTTER
          from his tool belt and cuts the entire drawer free.

          Air screams away through the gaps.
          Jim lunges to an emergency locker and pulls out an epoxy
          foamer - a steel canister like a fire extinguisher. He aims
          it at the hole in the hull and pulls the trigger.
          ORANGE FOAM blasts out, stiffening into a hard plastic. Jim

                    ejecting the empty pods.121.AURORA(HORRIFIED)They're not empty.EXT. STARSHIP EXCELSIORThe ship leaves a trail of glowing hibernation pods.INT. HIBERNATION BAYJim slides to a halt in front of a hibernation pod. Pulls a
          power driver from his belt and removes the cover panel.
          Aurora arrives on his heels. Watches as he works.
          An ominous sound approaches. BOOM-CHAK...BOOM-CHAK... The
          wave of ejections advances down their row.AURORAHurry.JIMI see it.
          He's not fast enough. The pod slides up and out of sight.EXT. STARSHIP EXCELSIORThe pods Jim was working on tumbles out into space.INT. CREW HIBERNATION FACILITYJim slams into the facility at a dead run. Scans the crew
          hibernation pods. Picks one and goes to work.
          Aurora enters. Looks at the man inside the hibernation pod: a
          stern fellow with a bristling gray beard.AURORAWho's that?JIMThe Captain.
          The sounds of the ejection wave come closer. Boom-chak.AURORAYou don't have much time.JIMI know.122.BOOM-CHAK! A crewman's pod vanishes into the ceiling on the
          opposite side. The ejections march down the row.AURORAGo go go!
          The wave of ejections reaches the end of the facility and
          marches back on Jim's side.JIMGot it!
          The hibernation pod hums to life.
          Inside, the Captain opens his eyes. He stares in astonishment
          at the first thing he sees: Aurora, in her bathing suit and
          shirt, a disheveled angel.BOOM-CHAK!The pod beside the Captain's shoots out of sight. He sees it.
          Looks at Aurora in alarm. Reaches out, his hand spread flat
          on the glass.
          She reaches back, her hand matching his.
          The Captain's pod rises through the ceiling and vanishes. Jim
          roars in frustration. Aurora leaps back with a cry of horror.DECK NINE - AFT OBSERVATION DECKJim and Aurora stare out the windows. In the ship's wake,
          five thousand pods glitter like diamonds. The cloud of pods
          dispersing as they watch.
          Stricken, Aurora walks away.
          Jim watches her go, then turns back to the window, looking
          out at the tumbling sparks.EXT. STARSHIP EXCELSIORThe starship recedes, leaving five thousand pods in its wake.FADE TO BLACK.SUPER: TWO WEEKS LATERINT. COMMAND DECK - DIAGNOSTIC CENTER - DAYJim stands at the Diagnostic Computer. The indicator light
          panel is a sea of green. Only a few red lights remain.
          Aurora enters.123.JIMThat's the last of the burned out
                    processors. When it reboots we should
                    be all green.AURORACan we talk?FORWARD OBSERVATION DECKAurora's writing couch. Jim and Aurora sit facing each other.
          Aurora gathers her thoughts. Takes a deep breath.AURORAYou know, if it wasn't for you waking
                    me up, I'd be drifting out in space
                    right now with the others. And if
                    you'd never awakened, the whole ship
                    would have been lost while we slept.
          Jim shakes his head at the tangle of it.AURORA (CONT'D)But no matter how we got here, the
                    fact is that we're here. All I know
                    is, when I have a good idea, you're
                    the person I want to tell. When I
                    wake up in the morning, I wish you
                    were there. When I look at you, I
                    just see Jim. And I miss him.
          Jim looks at her, moved and caught off-guard.JIMI've missed you too.AURORAI don't want to be angry anymore. I
                    can't be. We've come through too
                    much. No matter what you've done...
                    the fact is, I love you.
          Jim reaches out and takes her hand. She watches him
          intertwine his fingers with hers.
          Aurora gazes out at the stars - the endless shining sky that
          enfolds them. She looks at Jim and smiles.AURORA (CONT'D)Hell of a life.
          Jim meets her eyes.JIMHell of a life.124.She climbs into his lap, and they kiss. A kiss with a year's
          frustration behind it. A kiss that matters.EXT. STARSHIP EXCELSIOR - STARBOARD AIRLOCK - DAYThe airlock opens with a gust of air. Jim emerges in a space
          suit - followed by Aurora.ATOP THE SHIPThey walk toward the bow, stars reflected in their visors.AT THE BOWThey sit side by side. Aurora takes Jim's hand.
          They lean together, helmets touching, and look together into
          the blue stars of their future.FADE TO BLACK.SUPER: EIGHTY-EIGHT YEARS LATEREXT. HOMESTEAD II - CAPITAL LANDING FIELD - DAWNAn orange sun rises over green hills. In the foreground the
          roofs of Homestead II's capital city glow in the dawn.
          At the city's edge, timeworn spacecraft sit on their landing
          gear around a grassy landing field.
          Colonists gather. They watch the sky expectantly...
          A new star shines on the horizon.
          The star grows into a white starship gleaming in the sun. The
          Excelsior sweeps over the field with a rumble of engines.
          The ship's hull is scorched and abraded from its cosmic
          crossing. But the lights shine, the engines throb, the
          landing gear receive the weight of the ship.
          The starship's gangway lowers. The doors open.
          CHILDREN run down the gangway. Children of all ages, of all
          races. Twenty of them, thirty. They point at the sun, at the
          clouds, laughing, wide-eyed in wonder.
          We move up the gangway, through the disembarking passengers.
          Behind the children: Teenagers. Adults in smaller numbers as
          they grow older. Finally a handful of gray-haired elders.125.INT. STARSHIP EXCELSIOR - GRAND CONCOURSETransformed by the wear and tear of a century's habitation.
          Paths worn into floors, furniture repaired or re-purposed.
          We move past vegetable gardens. Battered sweeper robots water
          the plantings. Window-washers till the soil.
          The OAK TREE towers a hundred feet tall over the Concourse.
          Its branches brush the skylight far above.
          We move past walls decorated with murals and carvings.
          At the Concourse Bar, Arthur is slicing vegetables. His
          timeworn uniform mended by hand.
          At the aft end of the Concourse, a high wall. Here a long
          list of dates is inscribed. The last date is the ship's
          landfall on Homestead II; the first, Jim's awakening. In
          between: an accelerating tally of births, deaths, marriages,
          catastrophes and achievements...a century of shipboard life.
          At the base of the wall we find a table like an altar, where
          a collection of artifacts is displayed:
          The meteor pried from the Excelsior's heart.
          Gus's worn shipcard, his picture still visible.
          A beautiful hand-bound book. In the Blink of an Eye: Our
          Lives Between the Stars, by Aurora Dunn. Beneath these
          printed words, a handwritten dedication: For Jim.
          In the center of it all, in the place of honor: the photo
          strip of Jim and Aurora from their first date.
          They laugh. They clown. She kisses him.
          Aurora looks into the camera's eye.
          Jim looks at Aurora.FADE OUT.THE END.
