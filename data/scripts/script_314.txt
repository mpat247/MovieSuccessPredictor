                                                 February 10, 19981    EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - DAY                               1We circle around the island of Manhattan moving closer and
     closer till we're looking down on Fifth Avenue. As the
     melody continues to play we MOVE towards a building and ZOOM
     into a window.2    INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY                              2A fifty-year old female therapist (DR. GREENBAUM) sits at
     her desk, frowning as she takes notes. Books of Jung and
     Freud line the shelves.

     A young man (SEBASTIAN VALMONT) sits in a chair in front
     of her looking impatient.

     The therapist continues to write notes.DR. GREENBAUMJesus. We've been at this for six
               months.SEBASTIANI know.DR. GREENBAUMAnd you haven't made an ounce of
               progress.SEBASTIANI know.

     Sebastian takes out a cigarette.DR. GREENBAUM(not looking up)
               There's no smoking in my office.

     Sebastian sneers at her then puts the cigarette away. Dr.
     Greenbaum finishes her notes and looks up at him, shaking
     her head.SEBASTIANWhat do you want me to say? That I'm
               supposed to feel remorse because I act
               the way I do? The truth is I don't.

     Dr. Greenbaum shakes her head and takes notes.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Look, I'm not like all the other kids
               in high school. I don't care about book
               reports and extra-credit. Teachers
               are idiots anyway. The only challenge
               out there for me is women. You see a
               girl you like. You pursue them. You
               conquer. You move on. It's exciting.DR. GREENBAUMBut you said you have the worst
               reputation.SEBASTIANI do.DR. GREENBAUMDon't you want to change that?SEBASTIANLet me tell you something, doctor.
               Chicks love a guy with a bad rap.
               They say they don't, but they don't
               mean it. They all think that they're
               the ones that are going to "save me."
               The trick is to let them think it's
               true.DR. GREENBAUMI think that's all the time we have
               for today.SEBASTIANSame time next week?DR. GREENBAUMNo. This is going to be our last
               session.SEBASTIANWhy? I like spending time with you.
               You know, you're quite attractive for
               a woman your age. You have killer legs.
               Killer.DR. GREENBAUMThis isn't a joke. Your parents spend a
               lot of money to send you here. I'm
               trying to help you.SEBASTIANDon't be insecure, Doc. You're a big
               help.

     Sebastian picks up a book of Freud.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               He was a coke addict, you know.DR. GREENBAUMYou think you can come in here with that
               cute little smirk on your face and try
               and flirt with me. It doesn't work,
               Sebastian.SEBASTIANIt works a little.DR. GREENBAUMNo it doesn't. I see right through you.SEBASTIANYou do?DR. GREENBAUMI hope for your sake you grow out of
               this immature phase. It's going to get
               you into trouble.SEBASTIANWell, you don't have to get nasty about
               it.

     Sebastian approaches a photo on her desk and picks it up.DR. GREENBAUMMy daughter, Rachel.SEBASTIANYummy.DR. GREENBAUMDon't even think about it. Rachel is an
               exceptionally well rounded young
               woman, who happens to be attending
               Princeton this fall. She's way too
               smart to fall for your line of b.s.SEBASTIANReally? Care to make a wager on that?DR. GREENBAUMGood luck, Sebastian.SEBASTIANWhat, nervous I'm going to win?DR. GREENBAUMWould you please leave.

     Sebastian puts on his glasses and leaves.

               Asshole.

     The doctor stews for a moment, then reaches into her
     desk, sifts through some papers where she finds a pack of
     Benson & Hedges and lights one up. She looks at the photo
     of her daughter, then hits the speaker phone and dials.

               him.DR. GREENBAUMWho told you?RACHELYou don't know him. I'm so stupid.

               breath, and step out of the circle.RACHELWould you cut the psycho babble bullshit,

               killer legs and how we wanted to

     Sebastian standing in the elevator.DR. GREENBAUMYou son of a bitch.

     Doctor Greenbaum races down the hall pushing several
     people out of her way. Sebastian stares at her
     expressionless as the elevator doors close.

                              DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)
               You're gonna pay for this you little
               shit. You hear me.

     A DENTIST peers outside of his office to see what's
     going on. He exchanges looks with Doctor Greenbaum.

     Sebastian turns to her and sneers. He takes out a wad of
     money and shoves it in her breast pocket before entering
     the townhouse.6    INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                     6A SERIES OF SHOTSCLOSE ON:  A tuna on a chopping board. WHACK! A butcher

     BUNNY CALDWELL, a forty year old nouveau-riche socialite
     talks incessantly. CECILE CALDWELL, her beautiful

               Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you
               this fall. You've always been an
               inspiration to Beau and I on raising
               her. We just hope she can rise to the
               high standards which you've set for
               her.KATHRYNI'll do my best.

               beautiful language.

               You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never
               been in a co-educational atmosphere before.KATHRYNDon't worry, it's totally understandable.
               Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood
               are very upstanding gentleman, however
               there are the occasional bad apples.MRS. CALDWELLLike your step-brother Sebastian. I can't
               believe they didn't expel him after what he
               did to the school nurse.SEBASTIAN (O.S.)I hear she's recovering quite well.

     Mrs. Caldwell turns to see Sebastian standing in the
     doorway. He walks over and takes a seat.

               Nice meeting you.SEBASTIANCiao.MRS. CALDWELLLet's go, Cecile. Now!

     Cecile follows Mrs. Caldwell out the door. Kathryn
     closes the door behind them.SEBASTIANDo you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash
               and her stupid daughter are doing in my
               house?KATHRYNI'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.

     Kathryn sits on the sofa next to Sebastian. She unscrews
     her crucifix. The top part becomes a small spoon and the
     bottom part a small vial of coke.

               mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my
               inheritance per usual?KATHRYNHopefully, though she suspects that your
               decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the
               maid.

     Kathryn uses her crucifix as a coke-spoon and snorts a
     bump.

               What's wrong with you today? Therapy not
               going well?SEBASTIANIt was fine.

               Huge sacrifices were made on my part to

               shattered.SEBASTIANWhy go through Cecile? Why not just
               attack Court?KATHRYNBecause if there's an attack made on
               Court it could be traced back to me.
               I can't allow that to happen.
               Everybody loves me and I intend to
               keep it that way.SEBASTIANI see your point... though why should
               I care?KATHRYNI need you to seduce our young Cecile.
               Introduce her to your world of
               decadence and debauchery.SEBASTIANSounds intriguing.KATHRYNShe's quite cute you know. Young
               supple breasts, a tight firm ass and
               an uncharted pootie.

     to rub herself. He thinks for a moment, then:SEBASTIANI can't.

     Kathryn throws his hand off of hers.KATHRYNWhy not?SEBASTIANOh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy.
               "But I thought high school was only
               four years." I mean, please. She knows
               nothing. She's seen nothing. I could
               have her under the table at Au Bar
               sucking me off before the appetizer
               arrived. Go get one of those moron
               friends of yours to do it. I have a
               reputation to uphold.KATHRYNOh but diddling the therapist's
               daughter is a challenge?SEBASTIANThat was just simple revenge. What I
               have planned requires sheer genius.

     picks it up. It's the latest issue of "Seventeen."KATHRYNI'm not interested in the latest dating

     She closes her eyes and they repeat the scale. It sounds
     much better. Ronald takes the moment to study Cecile's
     face. It's obvious he's smitten with her.

     ON KATHRYN: who watches from the door. A grin crosses
     her face.

     Ronald replaces her other hand and plays a beautiful Bach
     Sonata, with he and Cecile sharing the bowing. He closes
     his eyes as the music takes over him. Now Cecile opens
     her eyes and gazes into his. The feeling is mutual.

     ON KATHRYN: She accidentally bangs her hand onto a table
     which causes a metal tray to fall to the ground.

     They drive on in silence. A smile comes over Annette's
     face. She turns to him, crosses her eyes and makes a
     face. Sebastian looks over.SEBASTIANWhat are you doing? Stop it, it's
               distracting.

               really hot and then I started shaking
               and then like, I don't t know... it
               felt like an explosion, but a good one.

     Kathryn laughs.KATHRYNCecile, you had an orgasm.CECILEI did?KATHRYNI'm so proud of you. You're becoming a
               woman.CECILEI am?

     Kathryn nods. Cecile embraces her, happy.KATHRYNNow listen. Now that you're on your
               way, it would be stupid of you to stop.

               happy pappy? Practice makes perfect,

               anymore problems.SEBASTIANYippy.KATHRYNWho are you spying on?SEBASTIANTake a look for yourself.

     He hands the binoculars to Kathryn, who looks out the

               she?SEBASTIANIf you must know, yes. I don't know

     The puppet attacks a laughing Annette. She playfully
     grabs Sebastian and starts to tickle him. Sebastian
     tickles her back.

     They roll around on the ground until Sebastian lands on
     top of her. A moment of tense silence passes and
     Sebastian kisses her. The kissing intensifies until she
     pushes him off her.

     Sebastian stands.

               take it anymore and decided to dump
               her. She flipped and he went on the
               defensive. I distinctly remember him
               saying the same thing over and over
               again. "I'm completely fucked up."
