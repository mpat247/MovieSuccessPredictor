          Jigsaw. He kills people very
          creatively.TRUDIEBut you don't give a shit who dies.
          There's no character development.

Sherrie joins Trudie as she pulls up a profile.   A glimpse of
a shirtless young hottie.SHERRIEThat's Channing Tatum.

It's hard to make out on the small screen.TRUDIEIt is not?     Is it?3SHERRIEFrom his Abercrombie days.        You're
          being punked.

The PHONE RINGS again.   Sherrie goes for the kitchen phone.SHERRIE (CONT'D)(into phone)
          Hello?MAN'S VOICE(from phone)
          Who is this?SHERRIEThe more impatient version of the
          person you just spoke to.MAN'S VOICEI'm sorry. You don't have to be a
          bitch about it.SHERRIEOf course I don't.     Eat me.

Annoyed, Sherrie starts to hang up when--MAN'S VOICEYou hang up on me and I'll cut into
          your neck until I feel bone.

Sherrie stops in her tracks.     Stunned.    Trudie looks at her.TRUDIE(to Sherrie)
          Who is it?

Sherrie's not sure what to think.    So she holds out the
phone.SHERRIEIt's for you.

Trudie takes it.   Hesitantly.TRUDIEHello?MAN'S VOICEWho is this?TRUDIE(into phone)
          Trudie. Who is this?4MAN'S VOICEThis is the last person you're ever
          going to see alive.

Trudie looks to Sherrie.   WTF?TRUDIE(into phone)
          What?SHERRIEIt's a prank. Hang up.

Trudie hangs up.TRUDIEWhy'd you hand the phone to me?SHERRIEYou're the one with the stalker.TRUDIEAre the doors locked?SHERRIEDon't freak out.

The phone RINGS again.   They stare at each other.TRUDIELet it ring.

Beat. The RINGING stops. They look relieved. Then,
Trudie's SIDEKICK buzzes on the kitchen counter. She picks
it up. Reads.TRUDIE (CONT'D)(reading)
          It's from stalker boy.
              (holds it up)
          "Answer the phone."SHERRIEOh for god's sake. It's a joke,
          Trudie. I bet it's Lexi or Karen.

Trudie takes off for the living room.SHERRIE (CONT'D)Where are you going?TRUDIETo make sure the front door is
          locked.5Sherrie follows her.INT. FOYER - NIGHTThey come to the front door. Trudie checks the locks as
Sherrie watches. Trudie turns back to Sherrie when...

The DOORBELL RINGS. They both SCREAM. Staring at the front
door. Sherrie starts for it. Trudie stops her.TRUDIEDon't answer it.SHERRIEIt's a joke, Trudie. Someone made
          a dummy profile and now they're
          trying to scare you.TRUDIE(calling out)
          Who is it?
              (no answer)
          I said -- who is it?
              (still no answer)
          Let's call the cops.

Just then, Trudie's SIDEKICK BUZZES with a message.   Trudie
jumps out of her skin. She looks at it, reading.TRUDIE (CONT'D)"I dare you to open the door."

Trudie's officially terrified. Sherrie is not quite sold.
She's contemplating opening the door.TRUDIE (CONT'D)No, Sherrie. Don't.SHERRIEWho emails you from the front
          porch?

Trudie shrugs.   Has no idea.SHERRIE (CONT'D)One of our asshole friends, that's
          who. I bet it's Karen and Lexi.

Sherrie starts for the door.    Trudie stops her.TRUDIENo, don't, I'm scared.SHERRIEOr Barry or Lance. It could be
          anyone we know. Lisa, Bailey,
          Wayne, or the hopeful long shot --
          Channing Tatum.

Sherrie goes to the front door -- unlocks it. Trudie steps
back, shaking. As the door rips open revealing--

AN EMPTY DOORWAY.   No one's there.   Sherrie steps outside
onto the porch.

Trudie watches her as she looks around.    She shrugs, turning
back to Trudie.SHERRIE (CONT'D)There's no one out here.

Sherrie stands in the doorway, facing Trudie -- her back
exposed to the outside. Just then...

Trudie's SIDEKICK BUZZES in her hands.    Trudie looks, opens
it up.SHERRIE (CONT'D)What does it say?

Trudie reads her phone.TRUDIEIt says, "I'm not outside.     I'm
          right behind..."

TRUDIE has time to register this.     She spins around to see a--A GHOST FACE KILLER SPRINGS FROM THE DARKNESS -- LUNGING ATHER. KNIFE IN THE AIR.Sherrie SCREAMS for her friend, watching as the GHOST FACE
stabs Trudie. The knife penetrates deep. Upon its
withdrawl, Trudie drops instantly. Dead.

Sherrie stands frozen. Until the GHOST FACE turns his
attention to her. That's all it takes for Sherrie to flee.

She spins around.   Starts out the front door when--

ANOTHER GHOST FACE KILLER APPEARS on the porch, completely
surprising her.

Sherrie starts to SCREAM but the GHOST FACE is too fast.      A
flash of silver.A KNIFE SLICES SHERRIE'S THROAT.    STIFLING HER SCREAM.7She stands there a moment, clutching her neck as the blood
pours from it. Unable to scream. A look of confusion and
helplessness.

A beat. As she GURGLES for air.      Then -- out of nowhere --A MADDENING SCREAM.CUT TO BLACK.   SUPERIMPOSE TITLE:STAB 6GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)You're fucking kidding me.

Suddenly, the CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL--INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHTA TV SCREEN -- STAB 6 -- MAIN TITLESIt becomes clear the previous sequence was merely the opening
scene from a movie on television.

As the CAMERA PULLS BACK FURTHER REVEALING -- TWO TEEN GIRLS
on a couch. In a different living room. In a different
house. They are watching the horror movie STAB 6.

RACHEL and CHLOE, both 17.    Best friends. Rachel grabs the
remote. Shuts off the TV.     She's the more outspoken one.RACHELThat was so fucking stupid. Pure
          horse shit. The death of horror.
          Right here. In front of us.

Chloe is more reserved.   She tries to defend it.CHLOEI jumped.    It scared me.RACHELA fucking Facebook killer?     You're
          kidding me, right?CHLOEIt's a few years old. Now, it
          would be twitter. Which would make
          a lot more sense.

Rachel gets up and goes to the kitchen.    Opens the fridge.8RACHELA bunch of articulate teenagers sit
          around and deconstruct horror
          movies until a ghost face kills
          them one by one. It's been done to
          death. The whole self-aware, post-
          modern meta-shit is over. Stick a
          fork in 1996 already.

Chloe stays in the living room.    It's an open floor plan so
they can see each other.CHLOEI like STAB movies. They're
          scarier. It's not torture porn or
          zombies or aliens or Asian ghost
          girls. There's something real
          about a guy with a knife. Who just
          snaps. It could really happen.

Rachel opens a soda and starts back to the couch where she
plops back down next to Chloe.RACHELI can't do it. These sequels don't
          know when to stop. They just keep
          recycling the same shit. Even the
          opening scene. Some random girl
          gets a call that undoubtedly ends
          in her getting killed. It's all so
          predictable, there's no element of
          surprise, you see everything
          coming...IN A FLASH, CHLOE PULLS A BUTCHER KNIFE FROM UNDER A PILLOWAND STABS RACHEL IN THE STOMACH.Blood spews as Rachel registers surprise.    Shock.   A very
unpredictable moment.

Rachel looks down and stares at the knife in her stomach.
Complete and insidious horror. As her friend Chloe's face
turns maniacal and evil. She pulls the knife out.CHLOEDid that surprise you?

Rachel tries to speak, but spits up blood.   Beat.RACHEL(barely audible)
          Why....

Chloe stabs her again.   Deeper this time.9CHLOEBecause you talk too much. Now
          shut the fuck up and watch the
          movie.

Rachel's body goes slack. As she sits there. On the couch.
Bleeding to death. Chloe reaches for the remote. And as
Rachel nears death, Chloe HITS PLAY.A MADDENING SCREAM.    CUT TO BLACK.   MAIN TITLE CARD.   AGAIN.STAB 7The CAMERA PULLS BACK REVEALING--INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHTA TV SET. The previous scene was also another fake out.
TWO TEEN GIRLS are lounging in a family room of a large
house. JENNY, 16, cute and bouncy, sits up LAUGHING
uncontrollably. She hits PAUSE.JENNYOh God, I love it. I've seen this
          movie five times. It gets me every
          time.

Her friend, MARNIE, 16, brainy, over-achiever.MARNIEYou're kidding? I don't get it.JENNYIt's like a TWILIGHT ZONE movie
          within a movie.MARNIEI get that. But it's illogical.
          It begs the question. If the
          beginning of STAB 7 is STAB 6?
          What's at the beginning of STAB 6?
          STAB 5? And, if so, what was STAB
          4 about?

Jenny stares at her.JENNYYou're over-thinking it.MARNIEYou know what kills me? Somewhere,
          someone thought that was clever.(MORE)10MARNIE (CONT'D)There's a reason I don't watch
          these movies.JENNYI can't believe you've never seen
          them. We live in Woodsboro.MARNIEThis has nothing to do with
          Woodsboro. I thought STAB was
          based on true stories.JENNYThe first three, the trilogy, was
          all about Sidney Prescott and the
          Woodsboro Murders.MARNIEYou know my mom went to school with
          her--JENNYAfter that, they just kept making
          lame ass sequels. Money.MARNIEDo we have to finish it? I know
          it's the anniversary of the
          Woodsboro massacre but I hate
          horror.

Jenny smiles.    Of course, she does.    Just then, she looks to
the hallway.JENNYDid you hear that?MARNIEI didn't hear anything.

Jenny rises.    Starts towards the hallway.JENNYI did.MARNIEDon't try and scare me.       I didn't
          hear anything.JENNYI'm not trying to scare you.MARNIEYou do this all the time.11JENNYNo, I don't.MARNIEHalloween night? When I walked
             into the kitchen and found you dead
             on the floor with blood everywhere?JENNYIt was Halloween.    Lighten up.

Jenny moves to the hallway.MARNIEWhere are you going?JENNYI heard something.

Marnie doesn't believe her.       But still...MARNIEAre we the only ones here?

Jenny nods.JENNYI'm gonna check it out.MARNIEI know you're trying to scare me.JENNYI swear I'm not.

Jenny takes off for the hallway.INT. HALLWAY - HOUSE - NIGHTIt's dark.    Jenny moves down it quickly.INT. FAMILY ROOM - HOUSEMarnie waits and watches from the living room.        Uneasy.INT. BEDROOM - NIGHTJenny enters her bedroom.       Simple.   Sweet.   She notices an
open window.MARNIE (O.S.)What is it?

Jenny calls out.12JENNYI left a window open.IN THE FAMILY ROOMMarnie hears that.    Calls out.MARNIEThat was stupid.IN THE BEDROOMJENNYI'm just gonna check it out.IN THE FAMILY ROOMMarnie looks around. Goes to the back patio sliding doors.
Checks to make sure they're locked. Just then, the PHONERINGS.JENNY (O.S.) (CONT'D)Will you get that?IN THE BEDROOMJenny has a cell phone in her hand.      She's the one who's
calling her own house.JENNY (CONT'D)Marnie?IN THE FAMILY ROOMMarnie goes to the phone.       Answers it.MARNIE(into phone)
          Hello.MAN'S VOICEHello.     Who is this?MARNIEMarnie.    Who's this?MAN'S VOICEThe last person you're ever going
          to see alive.MARNIESo lame.

Just then, Jenny BURSTS out LAUGHING.13IN THE BEDROOMJENNYI'm sorry.     I had to.MARNIE(from phone)
          You bitch. So not funny.

Jenny's very amused with herself.JENNYSomebody falls for it every year.MARNIEI don't know why you get off on
          this shit -- AAHHHH...

Just then, Marnie SCREAMS. It's a DEADLY SCREAM.    Then, the
line goes dead. Jenny pauses.JENNY(into phone)
          Marnie? Marnie?

Jenny looks to the bedroom door. Is she being pranked?      The
SCREAM was very real. She gets up and starts for the
hallway.INT. HALLWAY - HOUSE - NIGHTJenny moves down the hallway.    Back to the family room.JENNYMarnie?

Suddenly, a CRASHING NOISE. Something is upturned. It's
followed by silence. Jenny's looking a little scared.INT. FAMILY ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHTJenny enters to find the room completely dark and empty.    The
back patio doors are wide open. Jenny looks around.JENNYMarnie?   Where'd you go?

Jenny circles around the couch. Stumbles over something.
Tripping. She looks down and sees Marnie lying dead on the
floor. Her eyes COLD and LIFELESS.

Jenny SCREAMS. Just then, Marnie sits up LAUGHING
UNCONTROLLABLY. Jenny's been punked. A victim of her own
prank.14MARNIEGotchya.    You should have seen your
          face.

Jenny knows she can't be mad.MARNIE (CONT'D)I knew you were up to something.
          How'd you do the voice on the
          phone?JENNYAn app I downloaded.

Marnie gets up.   Jenny helps her.MARNIECan we please stop scaring each
          other now? It's bad enough we've
          had to grow up in this town.JENNYOkay, okay, you got me.

They both plop back down on the couch.    The glass doors open
behind them.MARNIEWhat now?JENNYWanna watch something else?MARNIEWe can watch the rest of the movie.JENNYWe don't have to.

Neither see the GHOST FACED FIGURE that enters through the
sliding glass doors. It slowly makes its way to the couch.MARNIEIt's okay.     Now that I'm in the
          mood.JENNYAre you sure?

The GHOST FACE moves closer to the couch.      Knife in hand.MARNIEMight as well.15Jenny reaches for the remote control.   Just as the GHOST FACE
raises the knife.JENNYYou like horror movies.   You're not
          fooling anybody.

As Jenny hits PLAY.   The Ghost Face STRIKES with the knife.THE SCREEN CUTS TO BLACK.   MAIN TITLES.SCREAM 4EXT. WOODSBORO - MORNING - ESTABLISHINGThe morning sun shines bright over the quaint town of
Woodsboro, California.

Little moments of small town life are all around.   Picture-
perfect. Innocent. Quiet. Then--

SIRENS BLARE as SQUAD CARS tear down Main Street, racing,
speeding... interrupting any hope of a peaceful day.INT. BEDROOM - RILEY HOUSE - MORNINGA CELL PHONE VIBRATES across the night stand. PULL BACK to
reveal a COUPLE sleeping. Finally, a woman sits up, barely
awake.

It's GALE WEATHERS. Or more accurately, GALE RILEY. Ten
years later. Still strikingly beautiful. But no longer in
that "camera ready" way. She eyes the VIBRATING CELL PHONE.
Looks to her husband. SHOVES HIM.GALEYou're buzzing.

He doesn't move. It forces Gale to get up. She walks around
to the night stand and takes the cell phone and SILENCES it.

Then, she takes a pillow and SLAMS IT DOWN on the man
sleeping beside her. He leaps up. Huh?

It's DEWEY RILEY. All grown up. Still sweet-faced and
boyish, but experience has seasoned him. Matured him.

Dewey looks around but Gale has already disappeared to the
bathroom.16INT. BATHROOM - MORNING - MOMENTS LATERGale is at the sink, brushing her teeth. Dewey enters.
Silence. He goes to the toilet room. His limp is nearly non-
existent. Years of physical therapy.

Dewey pees. Gale spits. More silence.           The unspoken tension
speaks volumes. Finally...DEWEYYou know what today is, right?

Gale nods.DEWEY (CONT'D)Are you going?

Gale shrugs.    Dewey finishes up.    Flushes.DEWEY (CONT'D)I think it would be nice if you
             went.

Gale studies herself in the mirror.      She's not the same Gale.
There's something missing.GALEI'm sorry about last night.    I
             wasn't in the right space.

Dewey finishes up.    Flushes.DEWEYWanna talk about it?

He turns to his wife.       But she's already left the bathroom.EXT. RILEY HOUSE - MORNINGA nice two-story house in a nice neighborhood.        Dewey exits
the house and moves to an SUV in the drive.

It has the WOODSBORO SHERIFF'S DECAL on the side. Just then,
a cute SPORTS CAR SPEEDS down the street. ROCK MUSICBLARING.DEWEYSlow down.

Dewey hops in his jeep.INT. SPORTS CAR - MORNINGBehind the wheel, KIRBY REED, 17, slows the car.17KIRBYShit.   Fuck.

A cute and quirky girl. Was probably a tomboy until a year
ago. Now, she's alternative. Or so she wants you to
believe. Either way -- she's cool.

She rounds the corner.EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - MORNINGThe neighborhood is lined with houses. Nice lawns,
sidewalks, etc. A typical small town neighborhood.

Kirby pulls up and parks in front of an old two-story home.
Full of character. She TOOTS the horn. A few moments and a
young girl emerges.JILL ROBERTSA 17 year-old beauty. Pretty in that ingenue way. Smart.
Strong. And a little bit goofy. She makes it sexy. A young
girl full of contradictions -- but instantly likable.
There's not a mean bone in her body.

She hurries to the car and hops in.INT. KIRBY'S CAR - MORNINGKirby turns the MUSIC DOWN, launches into a huge discussion.KIRBYOkay, don't get upset.   Trevor
          called me last night.JILLWhy is he calling you?KIRBYHe knows I have your ear and he
          wants to work it out.
              (looks across the street)
          Where's Olivia?

Kirby HONKS the horn again. Suddenly, OLIVIA MORRIS, 17,
emerges from the house directly across the street from Jill's
house. Olivia is sexy hot. Her walk, style, attitude is
fearless and fierce.JILLWhat did Trevor have to say?18KIRBYHe was fishing. He wants to know
          how upset you are.JILLWhat did you tell him?KIRBYEpic grief. Not since Bella fucked
          the werewolf have you known such
          grief.JILL(re: Olivia)
          Can we not talk about this now?

The car door opens. Kirby nods.    Gets it.   But as Olivia
crams into the back seat.OLIVIAOkay, so Trevor called me last
          night.

Jill throws her hands up.   WTF?   Kirby hits the gas and they
take off.JILLHe called both of you?    What is he
          thinking?OLIVIAHe wants to kiss and make up.JILLThat's not going to happen.

Just then, LADY GAGA'S TELEPHONE song starts playing.   Jill
starts digging in her bag, for her cell phone.OLIVIANot Lady Gaga. For god's sake,
          change your ringtone. Can we hate
          her yet? I so wanna hate her.

Jill eyes her CALLER ID -- JENNY RANDALLJILLWhy is Jenny Randall calling me?

Both Kirby and Olivia shrug.19OLIVIAI don't know. I don't like Jenny
           Randall. She threw up on me at
           Tony Marshall's luau.

Jill answers while Olivia explains her hatred.JILL(into cell)
           Hello?MAN'S VOICEHello, Jill.KIRBY(to Olivia)
           That luau was freshman year.OLIVIA(to Kirby)

          are freaks.KIRBYIt's Massacre Week.    People go
          looney, remember?

They continue on but Jill is clearly bugged by it.EXT. WOODSBORO - MORNING - ESTABLISHINGThe morning sun shines bright over the quaint town of
Woodsboro, California. Little moments of small town life are
all around. Innocent and simple. Picture-perfect.

Except on every lamp post for three blocks -- a GHOST MASK
has been placed over the light fixture. Somebody has played
a prank.

A CITY WORKER stands on a ladder, removing a mask. A female
officer oversees. This is DEPUTY JUDY HICKS, 30's. Cursed
with cute-ness, Hicks plays it serious at all times. She's
over compensating. But it just makes her cuter.

The SHERIFF'S JEEP pulls up.    Dewey slowly gets out,
surveying the stunt.DEPUTY HICKSHey, Sheriff. It looks like the
          celebration has begun.

Dewey looks up and down Main Street.    Damn.DEWEYDamn kids.     How'd they get up
          there?DEPUTY HICKSI'm sorry, you can never get away
          from this.

She smiles, small-town sweet.DEPUTY HICKS (CONT'D)Hey, I made some lemon squares.
          They're in my car.21Dewey shies away from the idea.DEWEYE-eh, no thanks, Judy.DEPUTY HICKS(moving closer)
          Sheriff, you're not cheating on
          your wife if you eat my lemon
          square.

Sidney who is full of quiet strength and honesty.SIDNEY (CONT'D)It was clear my life was in need of

Sidney rises.INT. FAMILY ROOM - KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHTCharlie and Robbie are playing a game of pool, in the middle
of a heated discussion.ROBBIEYou're totally missing my point.83CHARLIEYou're missing mine. The original
          STAB was an irreverent self aware
          post-modern deconstruction of the
          horror genre. How do you remake
          it?ROBBIEYou tap into the zeitgeist and take
          it to the next level.CHARLIEAnd what's the next level?ROBBIEPost-post-modern unaware self
          awareness. The genre has evolved.

Kirby shoots him a look.   "In your dreams."ROBBIENew rule. You can kill gay people

          changed. The black person still
          can't be the killer.ROBBIEYet. But Obama's in office.    He'll
          change that.KIRBYThe post-modern era of the 90's is
          what triggered these remakes to

          no choice but to start over.KIRBYBecause there's no such thing as a
          new idea.CHARLIEThat is sadistically sad. I refuse
          to believe it. So if you drink and
          do drugs -- will you live?ROBBIEYou can even say, "I'll be right
          back."KIRBYHere's the rule. Do the double

          be okay.IN THE KITCHENTrevor makes a drink.   He holds up the bottle of vodka.85JILLNo thanks.

He puts it down.   He'll pass too.    He pours two sodas.TREVORI can't believe Mr. Baker was
          behind it. That's crazy. Do they
          have any idea why?CHARLIEBecause he's bananas.      You should

          one either. Forget it, I watch too

          question. Are you ready?

No, Sid's not ready.    She's not ready at all.SIDNEYNo, I'm not ready.

A shaking, terrified, Kirby stares at Charlie in the yard.
Their eyes meet. He's begging for his life. Kirby turns to
Sidney, finding courage.KIRBYI'm ready.

Sidney puts her cell on SPEAKER so Kirby can hear.GHOST FACEEasy warm-up: Name the killer inSTAB--KIRBY(interrupting question)

Then, she goes to Charlie in the yard -- she still holds the
knife. Sid quietly opens the door when--GHOST FACESidney, you step out that door and
          I will slit him ear to ear.

Sid closes the door back.IN THE BACK YARDCharlie is watching, horrified, his life in their hands.GHOST FACE (CONT'D)What current remake featured--KIRBYTEXAS CHAINSAW, DAWN OF THE DEAD,HILLS HAVE EYES, AMITYVILLE HORROR,THE FOG, HALLOWEEN 1 & 2, LASTHOUSE ON THE LEFT, FRIDAY THE 13TH,NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, MY BLOODYVALENTINE, WHEN A STRANGER CALLS,THE STEPFATHER, BLACK CHRISTMAS,PROM NIGHT, HOUSE OF WAX, PIRAHNA,THE FOG -- I got it, right?

          Wait. In the FINAL CHAPTER we
          learned Mrs. Vorhees gave birth in
          1946, right? And, um, in the
          original, the two counselors were
          killed in the flashback in `58 and

Kirby leaps up.    With mad and crazy euphora.IN THE BACK YARDCharlie is relieved.   Sort of.INSIDE THE GUEST HOUSESid looks around the yard.   It's deadly quiet.SIDNEY(into phone)

Sidney kills it.   Looks around.   Turns to Kirby.SIDNEYYou won. Okay, let's try to get
          Charlie get to the house. Okay?

A petrified Kirby can only nod.102IN THE YARDCharlie watches the, curious as to hwat they're up to.
Sidney unlatches the door. Looks to the left, to the right.

Slowly, she steps out.   Kirb joins her.

ON CHARLIE -- Scared.    Worried.   Hopeful.

Kirby looks at the back yard.   To the main house.   There's no
sign of anyone. Anywhere.KIRBYI won.   Didn't I?IN THE YARDCasey and Sid race to Charlie. They rips at the tape around
his arms. All the while, looking around into the shadows of
the yard, knowing the KILLER could be anywhere.KIRBY (CONT'D)I won, Charlie. I won.

She rips the tap of his mouth, then arms...CHARLIEOh god, hurry...SIDNEYFinish this and get outta her. I
          gotta find Jill.

Sidney starts for the main house while Kirby continues
freeing Charlie.

With his hands free, Charlie starts helping. He rips his
legs free from the chair. He rises up. He grabs Kirby,
kisses her for saving his life.KIRBYWe have to hurry.CHARLIEYeah, just one thing.

She looks at Charlie -- his expression turns. Then, she sees
the KNIFE he reaches for, hidden in the chair. The next
moment happens fast -- AS CHARLIE STABS HER WITH THE KNIFE.

It SLICES INTO KIRBY'S stomach.     She stumbles back.103CHARLIE (CONT'D)How did you fucking know 11? You
          fucking cow, you were supposed to
          miss that one. Goddammit.

Kirby looks at him with childlike innocence.    Then, the pain
and shock follow.CHARLIE (CONT'D)Yeah, you win alright. You fucking
          prick tease. You win death.

He STABS her again -- FURIOUS AT HER. She COUGHS UP, unable
to speak -- a look of stunned horror. He STABS HER SEVERAL
MORE TIMES -- QUICK JABS. Kirby manages a SCREAM.

Sidney turns in time to see Kirby drop to the ground.   As
Charlie meets Sid's stare.CHARLIE (CONT'D)Okay, you look genuinely surprised.
          I can explain.

He takes a step towards Sid.    She stumbles back inside the
house. He starts for her.INSIDE THE HOUSESid locks the doors.   Races through the house to the...INT. FOYER - KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHTShe rips the front door open as GHOST FACE LUNGES AT HER,

find...

TREVOR -- HE REACHES OUT. GRABS HER. Sidney SCREAMS.
KNOCKS HIM OVER. Then, she moves fast. Sid rips the
bathroom door and bolts.104Sid runs to Kirby's bedroom door. She opens -- GHOST FACE is
before her. Sidney STRIKES with her kitchen knife.

It's catches GHOST FACE'S ARM.    He flinches.   It's enough for
Sidney to squeak by.INT. UPSTAIRS LANDINGSid races down the hall. She gets to the stair case.     Looks
down to see Charlie climbing up -- knife in hand.

Sidney runs down the hallway to an open doorway.    She goes
inside and trips instantly over something.

She comes face to face with Deputy Hicks. Sidney is on top
of her, staring directly into Hicks' cold, dead eyes.

SIDNEY SCREAMS.    Rolls off her. Turns to see -- GHOST FACE
enter the room.    Sidney looks around. There's no where else
for her to run.

Slowly, GHOST FACE approaches.GHOST FACEWhat's the matter, Sid? You look
           like you've seen a ghost.

And with that, the Ghost Face removes its mask, revealing
Jill underneath. She sports a wicked smile as she slips out
of the costume.

Sidney's face drops to the floor.JILLYep, it's me. Surprised.SIDNEYJill.   No...

Sidney tries to make a break for it.   But she comes nose to
nose with a loaded gun.JILLI've got the Deputy's gun. I'm
           dying to shoot it. I'm so sick of
           the knife thing. Now, get up.

Beat.   As Sidney does as told.INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - NIGHTCharlie is dragging Trevor's body to the top of the stairs.
It's obvious now that his feet have been bound and he's been
seriously injured. His shirt is bloody red.105CHARLIEC'mon, Trevor, buddy, this might
          hurt a little.

Charlie sits him up at the top of the stairs and then pushes
him. His body goes TUMBLING to the body.

He lands with a THUD. And a CRACK. Something broke. He lay
at the bottom of the stairs -- CRYING OUT IN PAIN. Charlie
trots down to join him.CHARLIE (CONT'D)It looks like you broke your leg.
          That sucks.

Charlie PRESSES down on it.    Trevor SCREAMS IN AGONY.TREVORYou fucker...

Jill appears, leading Sidney down the stairs.CHARLIE(to Jill)
          You asked her the easy questions.
          Didn't you use my list? I put the
          harder ones at the top. Why did
          you skip?JILLIt's done.     Can we move on?CHARLIECan we do him yet? With DNA
          testing, we're good with time line.

Jill turns the gun to Trevor -- without flinching.   She
shoots him in the forehead. He drops over dead.SIDNEYJesus... why...

Jill turns the gun back on Sidney.INT. KITCHEN - KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHTJill and Charlie lead Sid into the kitchen where Robbie lay
dead on the floor.CHARLIEYou got it figured out yet, Sid?
          In keeping with our remake theme,

          generation's--106SIDNEYBilly and Stu.JILLAnd we're the innocent victims.CHARLIEWe're Sidney and Randy. And we get
          to go to college and have a sequel.
          But this time -- Randy gets the
          girl.

Charlie moves to Jill -- she lets him kiss her. You get the
sense she tolerates Charlie. They break. He smiles.CHARLIE (CONT'D)You did real good. You're the
          perfect victim.

Jill can't hide it.   She's full of exhilaration.JILLI was so believable today. I told
          so many lies I actually believed
          them. I was born for this.

Jill's true colors start to take shape. She's a deeply
troubled sociopath. She looks to Sidney.JILL (CONT'D)C'mon, let's face it. I've had
          enough practice. Do you know what
          it was like growing up in the this
          family? In this town?CHARLIEHer mother was a slut bag whore
          just like your mother. Sisters. I
          made out with her mom once. She
          got drunk and slipped me the tongue
          one night.JILLDrunk bitch.SIDNEYYou crazy fucks...

Just then, the PHONE RINGS.JILLWatch this.107Jill races for it. Grabs it haphazardly and sinks into aMASTER PERFORMANCE OF HYSTERIA AND FEAR.JILL (CONT'D)(into phone)
          Oh my God, help me. He's trying to
          kill me. He killed Sidney... Help.

Jill hangs up.   Back to calm and poise.    To Charlie.JILL (CONT'D)C'mon, we need to get on with it.
          They'll be here soon.

He raises his arms -- as Jill holds the KNIFE.    She's going
to stab him.JILL (CONT'D)I'm going to do this hard.   It
          can't be tentative.CHARLIEC'mon, baby, let's do this old
          school, like Billy and Stu. It's a
          remake, baby.
              (ala Chinatown)
          No, it's a sequel. It's a remake,
          sequel, remake, sequel, sister,
          daughter, sequel...

Jill stabs him. She gets him DIRECTLY in the heart. He
drops to his knees. Instant pain. But his face registers
confusion too.CHARLIE (CONT'D)That's not the way we rehearsed
          it...

He doubles over, bleeding. She takes the opportunity --
STRIKES him again. And, in this moment, he realizes he's
been played and betrayed.JILLThere's been a change of plans.
          The problem with you, Charlie.
          It's always been about killing
          Sidney Prescott. My plan is a
          little bigger. I'm going to become
          her.

And with that, Jill stabs him again. Charlie can't believe
it. He's stunned and shocked. He falls back, crumbling to
the floor. Still. As Jill looks down at him with a glimmer
of diabolical glee.108A quick kick of her foot.    His body doesn't move.   He's dead.SIDNEYHow did you turn into this?JILLNothing is ever what it seems.
          Your words, Sidney. I've always
          been this. You know what it's like
          growing up related to you? All you
          hear is Sidney this, Sidney that,
          Sidney, Sidney...You were always so
          fucking special. Now it's my turn.

Jill takes the knife.JILL (CONT'D)And now you have to die.    Those are
          the rules.SIDNEYWhat rules?JILLThere's only room for one lead.
          Let's face it, Sid, you're ingenue
          days are over.

Jill STABS Sidney with the knife. She GASPS in pain. Jill
STABS her again quickly. This one WRACKS Sid's body. She
drops to her knees. Sidney's eyes roll back in her head.
Everything goes slow-motion.JILL (CONT'D)Apropos. Finally, what should of
          happened 15 years ago.

Sidney falls to the floor. Jill watches as Sidney draws her
last breath. Sad. Tragic. Epic. All at once.

Jill springs into action.    She's well rehearsed.

She kneels next to Charlie's body. She takes his limp hand
and claws at her own face, with careful attention to his
fingers. She's securing her DNA under his nails.

She then makes sure his class ring is facing out on his
middle finger and proceeds to PUNCH herself with his limp
hand.

It doesn't really create the desired effect.      She tries
BACKHANDING herself. That works better.109Quick and fast, she BASHES herself several times. It hurts
like hell. She CRIES out but continues until she hears aCRACK.BLOOD SPEWS FORTH. It's broken. Jill SOBS in genuine pain.
But, she's not done. She leans down closer to Charlie's
body. Takes his other hand and places it on her head,
clamping down on her hair.

She takes a BEAT to prepare herself. Then, YANKS AWAY.
RIPPING a large CLUMP OF HAIR from her own scalp.

Jill SCREAMS in pain.    That fucking hurt.

She throws Charlie's hand to the floor -- hair clutched in
his dead fingers. Then, she sees GALE begin to stir again.

Jill moves fast. She stands up and quickly moves -- racing
backwards, free falling into...THE GLASS COFFEE TABLEIt SHATTERS to pieces. Jill lay there engulfed by the
table's frame. GLASS is everywhere. Beat. She attempts to
rise -- it takes a few tries. As she CRIES OUT. She's truly
hurting now.JILL (CONT'D)Help me... Somebody help me...

Glass shards stick out of her arm, back and shoulders.   Blood
streaks her arms. Jill tries to get up, but can't...

She lay there CRYING ... WHIMPERING ...

As Jill lay there, hurt and bleeding. Her face full of
helpless innocence. The moment DISSOLVES TO:EXT. KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT - LATERThe aftermath. Flashing SQUAD CARS and AMBULANCES. The
carnage is overwhelming. POLICE barricade the property.
MEDIA gawk from a distance.

On a stretcher in the back of an AMBULANCE, Jill's wounds are
being treated. Her shirt has been cut up the back side, and
little pieces of glass are being picked from her flesh.

We reveal Dewey standing alone, staring guiltily at this
horror show. Eyes full of tears.GALEThis wasn't your fault.110Dewey doesn't speak.    He's terribly shaken.GALE (CONT'D)At least Jill's okay.

Dewey silently nods.    Gale hugs him tighter.AT THE AMBULANCE - MOMENTS LATERJill sits in the back, weakly talking to Dewey.   Laying out
her cover story.JILLCharlie told me he and Trevor had
          planned this since last year. He
          said they were Billy and Stu all
          over again. Except that this was
          going to be the reboot of all time.

In the B.G., NEWS REPORTERS and PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS shout:PRESSJILL!   JILL! Look OVER HERE!!

Jill timidly squints at Dewey.    A helpless little girl face.JILLWhat should I do?DEWEYI gotta warn you. For the rest of
          your life, they're never gonna
          leave you alone.JILL(fake overwhelmed)
          Maybe I'll just... give them one
          picture. So they'll go away...

Wincing, hamming up the pain, Jill "trembles" and lifts
herself to her feet with Dewey's assistance. Then -- she
steps around the edge of the ambulance.

FLASH! FLASH! FLASH! FLASH! FLASH! The yard BLAZES WHITE
WITH CAMERA FLASHES, like Yankee Stadium lit up at night.

Just then, an OFFICER    announces from inside the house --OFFICERWe have one alive.     A woman.

Dewey and Gale light up with this news.111DEWEYYou mean Sidney?AND CRASH AND BURN.
