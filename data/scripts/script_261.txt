               oncoming darkness is punctuated by the sounds of farm country -- 
               a few birds, a distant rumble of thunder from some heavy 
               clouds on the horizon, a dog's barking.

               CAMERA PANS the green, squared-off flatland, lit only by a 
               fine sunset in its final throes. Then, gradually, starting 
               from nothing, a rumble is heard, quickly growing louder and 
               louder until the sound of a train can be recognized.

               CAMERA PANS quickly, discovering the railroad line atop a 
               man-made rise of land, and the speeding passenger train is 
               upon us, flashing by with a roar.

               Then, as if from nowhere, the figure of a man hits the 
               embankment and rolls crazily down to the bottom into the 
               thick underbrush alongside the tracks.CLOSE SHOT -- BODYIt lies in the bushes, still, unmoving -- dead. CAMERA PANS 
               AWAY to the quiet peaceful countryside as the sound of the

               TITLE MUSIC begins with a crash.(MAIN TITLES)DELETEDFADE IN:EXT. MEGEVE -- DAYA handsome and elegant hotel perched on the mountain-side 
               overlooking the French resort town. A large, open sun deck -- 
               tables, gaily colored parasols, sun bathers.

               One of the latter is REGINA LAMPERT, a lovely young girl.

               She is, besides taking in the sun, involved in her favorite 
               activity -- eating.

               Then -- a dark, ominous shape intrudes in the f.g. FOCUS 
               CHANGES to bring into sharp relief a revolver -- shining, 
               black and ugly in the sunlight.

               REGGIE, unaware of her danger, continues to eat.

               The finger tightens around the trigger and finally the gun 
               shoots -- a stream of water arcs, with unerring aim, straight 
               into REGGIE's face.ANOTHER ANGLEIncluding JEAN-LOUIS, a French boy of six or so. REGGIE looks 
               at him sternly.JEAN-LOUIS(in for trouble)

                         Va jouer, mon ange.

               JEAN-LOUIS scampers off, content to have gotten off so 
               lightly. SYLVIE notices REGGIE's lunch which consists of 
               cold chicken, potato salad, rolls and butter, wine and coffee.SYLVIEWhen you start to eat like this 
                         something is the matter.

               No answer from REGGIE. SYLVIE begins reading a magazine as 
               REGGIE continues eating.REGGIESylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.SYLVIEï¿½a alors! From Charles?REGGIEHe's the only husband I've got. I

                         just too miserable.

               REGGIE picks up a chicken leg and starts off. SYLVIE regards 
               the devastated table before following.SYLVIEIt is infuriating that your

                         divorce!EXT. HOTEL TERRACE -- DAYAn open balcony running around two sides of the pool, sun-
               worshippers lying in deck-chairs. REGGIE and SYLVIE appear,

                         I admit I moved to Paris because I 
                         was tired of American Provincial,but that doesn't mean I'm ready for 
                         French Traditional. I loathe the 
                         idea of divorce, Sylvie, but -- if 
                         only Charles had been honest with me -- 
                         that's all I ask of anybody -- the 
                         simple truth. But with him, everything 
                         is secrecy and lies. He's hiding 
                         something -- something frightening -- 
                         something terrible -- and evil.

               She stops as she is aware of a weird figure hovering over 
               her. She wheels, terrified.CLOSE SHOT -- PERUVIAN SNOW-MASKA strange, grotesque knitted mask that completely covers the

               Eyeing one, then the other, SYLVIE sizes up the situation 
               and rises.SYLVIEViens, Jean-Louis, let us take a 
                         walk. I have never seen a Rothschild 
                         before.

                         dishonesty infuriates me. Like when

                         the small size. I always thought the 
                         large size was the largest size, but 
                         he says that the family size, the 
                         economy size and the giant size are 
                         all larger than the large size --

               his forty-odd years. Sickly would be the word that describes 
               him best -- pallid, consumptive-looking. He wears heavy 
               tortoise-framed glasses which fall down his nose and cause

               The EMCEE now circulates, forming teams, telling the patrons 
               to line up, making sure there is a woman next to every man. 
               REGGIE and PETER are the second couple in their line.

               Then the EMCEE picks up a basket of oranges and places one 
               under the chin, held securely against the chest, of each man 
               at the head of the line. Blowing a whistle, a signal for the 
               game to begin and the band to play, the men turn to the women 
               behind them and attempt to transfer the oranges from under 
               their chins to under the chins of the women -- without using 
               their hands.

               (This maneuver can only be accomplished by embracing one's 
               partner passionately and firmly pressing the orange against 
               the partner's throat until he or she can grip it tightly 
               enough with the chin to turn and offer it to the person next 
               in line, where the process begins anew. However, the slightest 
               miscalculation, which can be brought about by any number of 
               human frailties -- haste, modesty, inhibition or lack of co-
               ordination -- will surely result in losing control of the 
               orange so that it either falls to the floor [where it can 
               only be picked up by the chin] or it starts to roll and slide 
               from its proper place to some other, less proper, spot on 
               the human anatomy, forcing the man or the woman to retrieve 
               it -- again, with the chin only. This latter is an activity 
               which can prove extremely satisfying to old friends, or even 
               new friends who wish to become old friends, but can only be 
               a torment for total strangers and/or the English).VARIOUS SHOTS -- ORANGE GAMESome of the couples in various states of confusion,

               quite shapely young girl in a strapless dress (held up by an 
               abundance of cantilever). PETER 'takes' when he sees the 
               twin obstacles which might -- and probably will -- encumber 
               the game but increase his worldly experience.

               The contest begins: because of her stature he is forced to 
               move in low, making the ordinary embrace needed for success 
               difficult, if not impossible. Then, inexorably, the orange 
               starts to slip down the GIRL's front. Manfully he goes after 
               it.CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIEShe is enjoying it thoroughly.TWO SHOT -- PETER AND GIRLBending over backwards, in a sort of frontal half-nelson, 
               PETER makes a last valiant effort and voilï¿½, grips the orange

               They go at it, working their bodies together to make it all 
               possible. Then, for a moment, the game and the onlookers 
               seem less important than their proximity. But, alas, they 
               are too good despite themselves and the transfer is 
               accomplished -- again with appreciative cheers from the TEAM.

               REGGIE, with the orange now tucked firmly under her chin, 
               turns to the next team-member in line and is locked in an 
               embrace before she realizes her partner is LEOPOLD GIDEON,

               BARTHOLOMEW's photo.

               REGGIE starts to draw back but GIDEON holds her tightly.

               He and DYLE go to it, CAMERA FOLLOWING. Through the door, 
               which SCOBIE closes behind them, is a flight of stairs,

               beyond. DYLE and SCOBIE come out onto a level portion of 
               roof. On the street side, the roof angles down abruptly into 
               a steep, slate-covered pitch, broken only by two widely 
               separated oval-shaped dormer windows.

               Below these is a rain gutter, then nothing -- for seven 
               stories.DYLEVery pretty. Now what?SCOBIEI'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which

               SCOBIE aims the gun and starts advancing toward DYLE.SCOBIEStep back.

               DYLE turns and looks -- there is nothing behind him but a 
               sheer drop to the street.DYLEBack where?SCOBIEThat's the idea.

               Moving quickly, DYLE lashes out and hacks SCOBIE's gun hand 
               with the side of his palm and the gun falls to the roof.

               Following through, DYLE punches the large man full in the 
               jaw, but instead of falling, SCOBIE wraps his arm around 
               DYLE, holding on tightly until his head clears.

               Then, to his amazement, DYLE is lifted into the air and, 
               unable to break the bear-hold, carried toward the edge of 
               the roof. Working his arms between their two bodies, DYLE 
               suddenly flails them out with all his strength and the hold 
               is broken, but at the price of his coat and the flesh on his 
               back as SCOBIE's metal claw rips through both, a wound 
               extending from the center of DYLE's back to his shoulder.

               Both men look around for the gun, spot it simultaneously and 
               leap for it, both landing short of the mark. Now they grapple 
               with one another, each trying to break free and reach for 
               the gun.CLOSE SHOT -- THEIR HANDSTwo hands, one real, one metal, inch toward the gun.MED. SHOT -- DYLE AND SCOBIEThe battle is going to SCOBIE whose weight and strength are 
               beginning to tire DYLE, who is now on his back, trying to 
               stop SCOBIE from crawling over him. He has the large man by 
               both lapels of the raincoat in a last-ditch effort to hold 
               him. But SCOBIE, his face horribly distorted from the strain, 
               continues to inch forward toward the gun.

               Suddenly, DYLE releases his hold. With nothing restraining 
               him, SCOBIE lurches forward, tumbling past the gun, his 
               momentum carrying him onto the sloping part of the roof, 
               where he begins sliding down. SCOBIE beats wildly at the the 
               slate with his claw, trying to gouge a grip.CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE'S CLAWAs it slides across the slate, making a hideous scratching

               When we played our Charade we were like children posing, 
               Playing at games, acting out names, guessing the parts we 
               played.

               Oh, what a hit we made. We came on next to closing Best on 
               the bill, lovers until love left the masquerade.

               Fate seemed to pull the strings, I turned and you were gone.

               While from the darkened wings the music box played on.

               Sad little serenade, song of my heart's composing, I hear it 
               still, I always will, best on the bill Charade.
