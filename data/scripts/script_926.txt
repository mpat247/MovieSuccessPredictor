REMEMBER MEWritten byWilliam Fetters & Jenny LumetRevised April 16th, 20091   EXT. SMITH STREET STATION -- BROOKLYN -- NIGHT                 1It's very late. It's quiet. Just the sounds of The CityLINDA SANTANA CRAIG, an attractive Hispanic woman in her
    thirties, waits at the ELEVATED STATION for the F train.Linda looks great. She's dressed festively but tastefully.
    Next to her is her eleven year old DAUGHTER, ALICIA. She is
    twirling about the platform, still jazzed from the birthday
    party they attended in The City.Alicia wears a black dress with a pink cardigan and has a pink
    handbag. We notice a CHARM BRACELET with four-leaf clovers on
    her right wrist.The mother and daughter wait alone at one end of the station
    platform.TWO TEENAGE BOYS wait at the other end. They speak soft,
    SLURRED SPANISH to each other.Linda gives the boys a glance and evaluates. She watches them
    as Alicia spits a wad of gum into her mom's open hand.The Boys approach. Linda tenses. At the last second the boys
    make a hard left turn and disappear down the stairwell. It's
    quiet again. Linda relaxes, smiles at her daughter. The F
    TRAIN is rounding the final bend into the station.Their focus is on this train. It's getting closer, louder.And so they don't see, don't hear the Boys coming back up the
    stairwell behind them.Not until the boys have the mother and daughter boxed in and
    the one who can hardly grow a mustache is showing them his
    gun.Linda puts her arm around her daughter. Alicia looks
    terrified.The train roars INTO THE STATION as Linda quickly hands over
    her purse, her watch. She hands over her engagement ring and
    her wedding band.One of the boys yanks Alicia's little purse away from her.The other boy fumbles the wedding band. The ring CLANGS to
    the ground and rolls to a stop a few feet away.We hear MEN'S VOICES echoing up the stairwell.Now the Boys are boxed in. And starting to panic.2.-- THE TRAIN DOORS SLIDE OPEN --.The Boys see their way out and step into the last empty rail
    car, leaving the mother and daughter alone on the platform.Through the window on the train, Linda stares at the boy
    holding her daughter's purse, her face hardening into a MASKOF CONTEMPT.The boy clocks it. Who does she think she is?-- THE TRAIN DOORS BEGIN TO CLOSE --When a HAND WITH TATTOOED KNUCKLES reaches out and stops the
    car doors from closing.A forearm and gun extend out of that last subway car ...
    There's a muzzle flash... a distant POP... a cloud of smoke
    ... a mist of blood... and Linda's body collapses on itself.Alicia's face, shock, terror and blood.2   EXT. SMITH STREET STATION -- LATER THAT NIGHT --   M.O.S        2A WORKING CRIME SCENE, lots of uniforms and light, a white
    sheet draped over Linda's body where it fell.BLUE AND RED LIGHT dances against the stairwell wall where a
    man is taking the stairs two at a time. Late thirties, big,
    plain clothes, he is SERGEANT JAMES CRAIG. When he reaches
    the platform, he stops.Craig kneels before the white sheet. Peels it back. We stay
    on him. We don't see what he sees. We just see how he sees
    it. Then he turns...THE WEDDING BAND. It's been tagged and numbered as evidence.
    Craig picks it right out of the chalk outline and slips it
    into his pocket.Alicia, wrapped in a blanket, standing next to a round police
    MATRON. The Matron is tenderly trying to clean Alicia's face.
    Alicia locks eyes with Craig and stumbles towards him, her
    legs not quite working.Craig saves her from the stumble and envelops her, lifting
    her as the blanket falls to the ground.Alicia makes little gasping noises. Trying to speak but
    can't.Craig walking back now, carrying his entire world. He reaches
    the stairwell and suddenly falls to one knee. Alicia gasps.3.The closest UNIFORM puts a hand on his arm. A moment.
    Composure. A deep breath. Then as quickly as he went down,
    he's back up.Craig looks back now, taking it all in. Is it real? Sees all
    the cops looking at him, then begins down the stairs.WE DRIFT UP above the station until we find ourselves with a
    clear view of the southern tip of Manhattan, where the TWINTOWERS STAND TALL.3   INT. LOWER EAST SIDE RAILROAD FLAT -- BEDROOM -- MORNING        3SUBTITLE: "Eight Years Later"Tiny kitchen, clutter, a MESSENGER BIKE hanging from hooks on
    the wall, a lot of books. There is a PHONE RINGING under the
    bed.TYLER ROTH, early twenties, handsome, looking haggard. He is
    sitting on the floor, shirtless, bed head, wrapped in a
    blanket. A GUITAR is on his lap. Tyler has propped some well
    worn, hand written pages of MUSIC against a box of off-brand
    laundry detergent and is squinting at the notes, frustration
    etched in his face.A forgettable BLONDE lies sleeping on the bed.Tyler, not a born musician, is trying to teach himself one of
    the PHRASES OF MUSIC in front of him. He is completely lost
    in the moment, with DEEP GROOVES in his fingers. By the
    ASHTRAY next to him, we can tell he's been at this a couple
    of hours.The Blonde in the bed re: the ringing phone...BLONDE(out of it)
              Hello?Tyler gropes around the floor with one hand until he finds the
    phone, simultaneously glancing at the digital clock. His eyes
    widen in alarm.TYLERYeah...
                  (listens)
              Of course. I'm on my way. I
              know...I know...I know...I know.Tyler climbs out of his blanket and yanks on a pair of dark
    suit pants. Before he pulls on his white undershirt we
    observe a TATTOO that simply says "Michael" over his heart.4.He searches through a beat-up chest of drawers, seeking a
    reasonably clean button down shirt...TYLER V/OGandhi said that whatever you do in
              life will be insignificant but it
              is very important that you do it......And scrubs at a mysterious stain on the shoulder of an
    expensive but worn to hell suit jacket with a dishwasher
    brush.TYLER V/O...I tend to agree with the first
              part.4   EXT. GREEN WOOD CEMETERY --BROOKLYN -- LATER                     4A cluster of MOURNERS stand before a tombstone in the
    distance. They are not in funeral dress, as this is not a
    funeral. It's a memorial.A beat up GYPSY CAB with a WEST INDIAN DRIVER pulls to a
    stop. From the trees and the sky we know its LATE
    SPRING/EARLY SUMMER. A gorgeous day.Tyler gets out of the cab, holding the rim of his empty
    coffee cup in his teeth. He sorts a rumpled wad of singles
    and hands some to the driver, who screeches into reverse.
    Time is money.Tyler crushes the coffee cup flat and slips it in his jacket
    pocket then lights up a smoke. He takes one long drag then
    extinguishes it and slips the butt into his pocket. He begins
    towards the mourners.His mother... DIANE HOFFMAN, a beauty. Past burdens etched in
    the lines on her face. Dressed tastefully in expensive
    bohemian. She smiles like someone who's been crying but
    doesn't want anyone to know she has.TYLER(sweetly)
              Hello, your majesty. How are you?DIANEI'm fine... you look good...He kisses his mother's hand and he's moving to greet his
    stepfather...LES HOFFMAN, Unruly curls streaked in gray, tweed jacket and
    tie. They exchange a firm handshake and muttered hellos.5.The weight of Tyler's gaze falls to CAROLINE ROTH, his
    diminutive bespectacled, eleven year old sister. She's
    holding a little paper bag.She flashes him a look. He kneels besides her and whispers...TYLERThanks for organizing everybody.Caroline makes a face. Turns her nose away from him.CAROLINEYou smell like Listerine and beer.He snorts and kisses her cheek.Caroline reaches into her bag and takes out a handful of
    smooth white stones, on which she has painted the names:
    "Mom" "Tyler" "Les", "Dad", "Caroline". She begins to arrange
    them in a little circle on the grave.Tyler's father...CHARLES ROTH, late fifties, breathes power, precisely
    dressed, two hundred dollar haircut. A predator.CHARLES(aside, to Tyler)
              You couldn't wear a tie?Tyler holds his father's eye.TYLERCould have.Beat.Charles adjusts his own collar like it's an explosive.POV: The Tombstone. The four adult family members stand side-
    by-side. They look like strangers on the subway as Caroline
    sits on the ground, arranging the stones.5   INT. JUNIOR'S RESTAURANT-- BROOKLYN -- AFTER                  5The family sits together in a booth. Tyler rolls a Bic
    lighter over his knuckles. Caroline draws a funny portrait of
    Tyler on her napkin. He is smoking nine cigarettes at once.
    Diane gives the menu a ridiculous amount of attention. Les is
    eyeing the Cheesecake. Charles subtly aligns his silverware.6.DIANE...This is nice... I think it's
          nice that we still do this...CAROLINE(gently)
          Mom.DIANEI forgot. I'm trying to purge
          "nice" from my vocabulary. Michael
          would like that we still do this.Tyler takes out a cigarette. Lights it. Without saying a word
his mother takes it and snubs it out in an empty water glass.DIANE(to Caroline)
          Did you tell Tyler what your art
          teacher said about your portrait?Caroline, as bemused as an eleven year old can be, looks at
her mother, then at her brother. She adopts a very motherly
tone.CAROLINETyler, did I tell you what my art
          teacher said about my portrait?TYLERWhy no, Caroline. What did your art
          teacher say about your portrait?DIANE(smiling)
          You two. I quit.She flickers a glance at her ex husband and squeezes Les'
hand.CAROLINE...She was very impressed. She said
          I captured a moment like a young
          James Whistler.The WAITRESS brings platefuls of extravagant cheesecake to
the table. Les dives in. Charles is having toast. He sips a
glass of water and takes a surreptitious glance at his Patek
Phillippe.7.TYLERYoung Whistler... good... 'cause
          Whistler really fell off late in
          his career. He's the Michael
          Jackson of European art history.DIANEShe suggested your sister take
          Pratt's Summer Art Intensive and
          that's hugely prestigious.Caroline looks a bit sheepish, Tyler high fives Caroline.Diane, again, flickers a glance at Charles.CAROLINEI would be the youngest one, ever,
          practically...CHARLESTyler, would you please pass the
          butter?Beat.DIANECaroline was speaking.TYLER(to Charles)
          Are you really this clueless? Are
          you really dismissing her like
          this?Diane touches Caroline's hair.CHARLESCaroline is perfectly capable of
          speaking up if she is feeling
          dismissed. Caroline, are you
          feeling dismissed?CAROLINEI'm okay.CHARLES(solicitous, to Caroline)
          I didn't mean to change the
          subject.TYLERWhat was the subject?8.CHARLESExcuse me?TYLERThe subject we were discussing.
              What was it?Beat.CHARLESNow's not the time for your heroics
              TylerTYLERNo. It's the perfect time.Charles makes a minute adjustment to his collar.Father and son lock eyes until...TYLER(whispering, to Caroline)
              Do you need me to take you
              anywhere?Caroline shakes her head.CAROLINEI'll stay with mom.Diane glares at her ex-husband.Tyler rises and kisses his sister's forehead.TYLERThen I'll see you after school.CAROLINEKay.He exits as Caroline sips her lemonade, avoiding everybody's
    eyes.6   INT. SUBWAY CAR -- JUST AFTER                                 6Tyler standing although there are a few seats available. The
    car window strobes behind him. He takes off his jacket and
    button down and ties them both around his waist.9.7   INT. WALL STREET COFFEE SHOP -- AFTER                             7Tyler in his pants and white tee shirt looks completely out
    of place amidst all the business types.He sits in the last booth facing the street. His tattered
    JOURNAL lies open in front of him, a BINDER CLIP holds his
    page as he works quietly crafting an entry.The HOSTESS, tired, in her 60's, slides a piece of baklava on
    the table as she shuffles past.HOSTESSEat something.Tyler gives her a huge grin.TYLERYes, ma'am.8   EXT. 4TH STREET -- JUST AFTER                                     8Tyler and his roommate, AIDAN BREWER, 22, energetic,
    inappropriate, walking west towards N.Y.U. Young people in
    easy, summery dress. Tyler smokes. Aidan doesn't. Aidan
    remembers something, smirks.AIDANI sold your girlfriend a
              toothbrush.TYLERYou sold my who? ...What?AIDANThat voluptuous, delightfully
              oblivious little blonde you left in
              your bed this morning... I sold her
              a toothbrush. Got three bucks.TYLER...Congratulations?AIDANAre in order, yes. Because that
              sale inspired our newest business
              venture: "The S.L.U.T."TYLERI was unaware we had a previous
              business venture.10.AIDANThe 'Single Lady's Universal Tote'.
It's the one-night-stand travel
pack for women. We throw in some
make-up, toiletries, cell phone
charger, cab numbers. Retail it at
S19.95, maybe do an infomercial.TYLERAnd you think women would buy this?
With money?AIDANHey one-night-stands happen... It's
a part of life... like stubbing
your toe. Sometimes you misjudge a
corner and bend back your pinky
toe, other times you wake up in a
freshman dorm wearing a field
hockey tee shirt wondering why your
balls smell like cinnamon...TYLER(nodding sagely)
Of course. Yes.AIDANDon't underestimate the novelty
gift market. Think about it...
instead of giving that token slutty
friend a ten-inch purple dildo for
her birthday, you hook her up with
"The SLUT." Everyone has a laugh
and the implication that she'll
probably use it someday remains.
What do you say? Are you down?TYLERI'm down with getting you on some
sort of medication.AIDANOK...fine...be cynical...just
remember at some point in history
two people had a conversation just
like this about the light bulb. One
of them went on to fame and fortune
and the other one probably went to
work at Mickey D's or something.TYLEROr Denny's. Denny's was big in the
19th century.11.9    EXT. COBBLE HILL -- MORNING                                   9A TINTED TOWN CAR stops in-front of a funky corner brownstone
     where Caroline waits in a plaid jumper on the front steps.
     THE DRIVER opens the back door of the car.10   INT. TOWN CAR. (DRIVING) -- LATER                         10Caroline in the cavernous backseat alone. Her pink knapsack
     her only company.The Town Car stops at a crosswalk for a GROUP OF CHILDREN in
     jeans and tee- shirts on their way to a local Public School.
     Caroline sees them through the tinted glass. They couldn't
     see her even if they wanted to.PROFESSOR (O.S.)It's an unfortunate reality but a
               reality nonetheless ...11   INT. LECTURE HALL -- NYU --DAY                            11TYLER sits in the back of the room. Their PROFESSOR addresses
     the few students paying attention.PROFESSOR...in the wake of terrorist attacks
               these insurance company actuaries
               are provided a unique opportunity
               to raise premiums and profits to
               protect against events that will
               likely never occur again...One girl, a focused brunette with beautiful eyes, takes notes
     relentlessly. She is present, absorbing the material. She
     raises her hand.GIRLIsn't that also an ethical
               question?Tyler shoots her a glance. He takes in her lovely face, her
     casual dress, and the CHARM BRACELET with its four leaf
     clovers. WE REALIZE this is Alicia "Ally" Craig, now 19.Tyler grimaces at the question and its implications of hope.12   EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- AFTERNOON                            12At the Alice in Wonderland statue where KIDS climb all over
     the faded bronze mushroom caps and characters.12.The statue is warm, the bronze absorbing the late spring sun.
Tyler is perched on the Mad Hatter, his face turned towards
the sun while Caroline hides with the dormouse.Tyler lights a cigarette. AN UPTIGHT MOMMY glares at him.UPTIGHT MOMMYWhy don't we make this a non-
          smoking statue?CAROLINE(emerging)
          Yeah, Tyler . Why don't we make
          this a non-smoking statue?He makes a face.CAROLINEYou promised you'd quit...TYLERI know.CAROLINEYou're gonna get emphysema and then
          you're gonna have to drag an oxygen
          tank with you everywhere...TYLERYou think that would be the worst
          part about having emphysema?CAROLINEEverywhere you go, Tyler. Even the
          bathroom.Tyler takes a final drag. Tosses it on the ground.CAROLINEWhy do you think Dad doesn't
          wanna...like, listen to me?TYLERDad loves you.Caroline gives him a look.CAROLINESo? You can love someone and not
          want to spend any time with them.Caroline is climbing around Alice. Her hands on Alice's hair.13.TYLERYou've got that right.CAROLINEMom loves Aunt Sara. But at
               Christmas, last year, she wouldn't
               let Les leave them in a room
               together 'cause she said there
               would be a "yule tide homicide."TYLERThat's because Aunt Sara drinks...
               You don't drink, right?CAROLINEDuh.TYLERSo why would anyone wanna avoid
               you?Caroline shrugs, not convinced. A silent moment passes.CAROLINEMichael used to drink.TYLERYeah. He did. But Michael was 21.
               All 21 year olds drink because it's
               new and exciting. Aunt Sara drinks
               because she wishes she was 21.A shared smile.CAROLINEYou're 21.Tyler's smile fades.13   INT. THE STRAND BOOKSTORE -- DAY                            13Tyler on a rolling ladder, shuffling books around. Aidan on
     the floor, eating two pieces of pizza, folded down the
     middle, at the same time.AIDANWhat about Atlantic City for your
               birthday this year? Get a suite.
               Couple of ladies. You could call
               Toothbrush Girl, what do you think?TYLERI think I'd rather be sodomized.14.AIDANHey, it's your day.He gestures to the shelves.AIDANWhat's the point? How do you know
          where anything is in this place,
          anyway? There's like...AIDAN/TYLER"Eight Miles of Books!"TYLERI don't expect you to appreciate
          this, but the schematic for this
          particular shelf is authors who
          were sleeping together...AIDANNo shit?TYLERAnd ended up dead or in prison.Beat.AIDANThis is why chicks dig you.Tyler laughs.AIDANSeriously. They like this freaky
          poetic crap. I ran into Megan
          yesterday. She's bartending at Don
          Hill's tonight. She wants us to
          stop by. She practically begged me.TYLEREh.Aidan, visibly frustrated with Tyler's reluctance, grabs the
rolling ladder and pushes Tyler into the Romance novels.TYLERHey!AIDANHey nothing. You've been a ghost
          the past couple weeks. You never
          wanna go out. I'm feeling
          unappreciated here.(MORE)15.AIDAN (cont'd)
               I can't deal with this brooding
               introvert shit anymore man. I'm
               ready to set up an intervention.A silent moment passes.TYLERYou realize interventions typically
               discourage binge drinking?AIDANOne drink. Come out for one drink.TYLERWhen's the last time you had one
               drink?14   INT. DON HILL'S -- THAT NIGHT                                14A hip venue on Greenwich Street. Deejay. Music pumping.
     Aidan and Tyler make their way through the crowd to a
     congested bar where the CUTE BARTENDER is swamped.AIDANHey, Megan!She ignores him.AIDANYou look great! Can I get two
               Heinekens?MEGANDo. Not. Speak.Tyler snorts with laughter.AIDAN(genuine)
               Is she mad at me or something?TYLERNo no. Girls are like that when
               they're way into you.AIDANOh.Two nubile young GIRLS approach Aidan. Tap his shoulder.GIRL #1Excuse me?16.Aidan flashes a winning smile.AIDANWell, hello...GIRL #1Could you take a picture for us?She holds out her camera. Aidan hesitates, then smiles.AIDANMy pleasure...The girls pose. Aidan takes the camera. Turns it around.
     Extends it. Smiles. And promptly SNAPS A PICTURE OF HIMSELF.
     He casually returns the camera to the confused young woman.Megan returns and practically flings the beers at Aidan.AIDANThanks. You've met my roommate...MEGANI hope you die.Tyler laughs his ass off.TYLERShe's all over you. Cheers.They clink bottles.15   EXT. GREENWICH STREET -- LATE NIGHT                          15Tyler and Aidan stand with the girls from Aidan's photo
     opportunity. All are thoroughly intoxicated. There is a knot
     of CLUB GOERS halfway down the block, drinking and having a
     fine time.AIDANI love this street. I love this
               city. Where are you guys from,
               again?AIDAN'S GIRLMiami.AIDANMiami. Miami, Barcelona, Rio. New
               York is it, man. God broke the mold
               when he made this city.17.TYLERYou ever actually been to any of
          those places?AIDANWhat's your point?There's a gust of wind. Aidan's girl shivers. She's wearing a
tiny dress.AIDAN'S GIRLWhat are we doing? I'm freezing.AIDANShoulda worn a jacket. Like me.O/S WE HEAR: a beer bottle crashing on the ground, and from
far away a ghostly, plaintive girl's voice disappearing into
the night...VOICE O/SMichael...Mi-i-chael!Tyler turns towards the sound. It's as if he's trying to spot
a train in the distance. His hand goes to his pocket and
fishes out his pack of cigarettes.AIDAN'S GIRL(to Aidan)
          Asshole.She walks away, looking back at her friend, annoyed.AIDAN'S GIRLAre you coming?Tyler's Girl looks at Tyler, who is still preoccupied.TYLER'S GIRL(to her friend)
          Hold on, Lauren.The girls step away. Tyler's Girl appears to be trying to
convince her friend to stay. Aidan watches them, hopefully.Tyler isn't watching them. He's watching two cool looking
MUSICIANS, crossing the street with the LIGHT, carrying SOUNDEQUIPMENT.A quartet of NEANDERTHALS pulls up at the light in front of
them in a car, aggressive music playing. The Neanderthal at
the wheel has the brilliant idea to rev his engine and lurch
the car forward, startling the musicians, toying with them.18.MUSICIAN #1 glares, but gives no further response, he just
wants to get across the street. The Neanderthal revs and
lurches again.MUSICIAN #2 slams his hand on the hood of the car.MUSICIAN#2What's your problem?NEANDERTHAL DRIVERMy problem? Keep your hands off my
          car, asshole.MUSICIAN#2Blow it out your ass, Guido.MUSICIAN#1Go back to Long Island.The car's four doors open, and the Neanderthals lope to the
front of the car. The driver is holding a mini baseball bat
at his side.NEANDERTHAL DRIVERI'm from Queens, faggotA Neanderthal shoves one of the musicians, and the driver
starts wailing on the other with the bat. Tyler watches as
the Neanderthals overpower them. The altercation has turned
into a full on assault. The Musicians are getting stomped
into the pavement.TYLER'S GIRLSo we were thinking we could go...Tyler walks right past the girl without even looking at her.AIDAN(under his breath)
          God damn it.Aidan runs off after Tyler.Tyler jumps fully into the thick of it, swinging, grabbing
the beefiest Neanderthal in a choke hold and pounding the
guy's face. He fights like a pit bull. Not feeling, not
stopping.Aidan gets punched in the face. Tyler elbows the nose of the
guy who punched Aidan and it spurts blood. Then someone hits
Tyler in the gut, and he doubles over and takes a knee to the
chin. The musicians get back to their feet and fight back.
It's a brawl.19.Aidan's girl is screaming for the cops. Tyler's girl,
     following the instincts of the inebriated, has teetered near
     enough to the brawl to imperil herself.A Neanderthal swings at Aidan and misses, grazing the girl.
     She jerks away in her high heels and crashes to the pavement,
     splitting her lip on impact. Tyler head butts the guy.16   EXT. SIDE STREET -- LATER                                   16An AMBULANCE and TWO E.M.T.'S are on site.THE COMBATANTS from the brawl are lined up on the curb.SERGEANT JAMES CRAIG, a little older and heavier than when we
     first met him at the train station, is standing with the
     Girl, who is a mess. Her nose bloody, her dress torn.Craig shields the Girl with his body, listening carefully to
     her and her friend as the two girls GESTURE ANGRILY at the
     Neanderthals. Craig's eyes flicker in the same direction.Craig's PARTNER, LEO, AFRICAN AMERICAN, a few years younger,
     is on the radio to Dispatch.Craig snaps his fingers at one of the E.M.T.'s and receives a
     blanket, which he carefully wraps around the girl. Then, to
     his partner, indicating Tyler and Aidan...CRAIGCut those two loose.Leo puts down the handset and uncuffs the guys.LEO(quiet)
               Take a walk.Tyler takes a beat, looking at the lineup. Aidan, rubbing his
     wrists, gestures "Let's go". Tyler looks at the bloodied Girl
     and...Craig, going through the pockets of Neanderthal #1.CRAIGAnything in here that's going to
               stab me, Einstein?Craig finds a packet, or a vial.CRAIGNice. You like to get high and hit
               women?20.Aidan gives Tyler's elbow a gentle tug. Tyler's caught up in
the action.NEANDERTHAL#1I don't even know the bitch.Rage flickers across Craig's face.Craig moves down the line to one of the musicians, going
through their pockets.CRAIGHow about you two?Tyler, compelled, drawing closer to the action.MUSICIAN#1It wasn't us, man!NEANDERTHAL#1That cocksucker kicked my car!CRAIGShut up, genius.MUSICIAN#1(to Neanderthal)

          Tyler...LEO(quietly, to the guys)
          Take a walk, I said.TYLERHey!Craig, big angry Irish cop, turns to Tyler.21.TYLERThey didn't do anything. They
          didn't start this. Those assholes
          did. Why do these guys have to go
          downtown?CRAIGWhat are you still doing here?TYLERThis is bullshit. It was those
          gorillas who started this.Craig moves slowly toward Tyler and starts going through
Tyler's pockets, roughly. He finds his wallet. Starts rifling
through.CRAIGWell, Mr. Roth. What makes you
          think I give a shit?TYLERYou're a police officer. You're
          supposed to.What the hell? Craig looks from the guy he was frisking to
Tyler's girl, wrapped in a blanket. She spits blood. He turns
a bit to Tyler.CRAIGIt's a great relief to me, Mr.
          Roth, to know that you're on top of
          the situation. Now go the fuck
          home.He turns back to work.Tyler looks briefly at Aidan. Aidan looks desperate "Please!
Let's get out of here!"Tyler TOUCHES CRAIG'S ELBOW.Aidan's jaw drops. Leo takes several silent steps in. Craig
looks at his own elbow then looks at Tyler. The kid must be
out of his mind.TYLERHow about you do your job?SLAM. Craig takes Tyler's legs out, driving his face into the
pavement, a GASH opens above Tyler's LEFT EYE. Tyler lies
there dazed and disoriented as Craig, with one knee on
Tyler's neck, crushes his face into the ground. He slaps the
cuffs on.22.17   INT. PEARL STREET LOCKUP -- AFTER                           17Who knows what time it is. A lovely ASSORTMENT OF

     Everybody looks like shit. Tyler sits on a bench in the
     holding cell, looking quite relaxed.The lock up door slides open and Aidan is returned to the
     perch. The ESCORTING OFFICER shouts across the din to Tyler.ESCORTING OFFICERYou can have your call now.TYLERI'm good.The door slides shut behind Aidan.AIDANYou're good? Thank God you're good.Beat.AIDANWhat are you trying to do? What did

     brown sugar from the dispenser, then flips open a bottle of

     his coffee.ALLYWhat did you tell me you were going

     car.She flips down the visor and checks her very light eye

     Lights it. Draws the ire of...THE RECEPTIONISTYou know you can't smoke in here.Tyler looks down at a heavy crystal ash tray on the coffee
     table in front of him. It's clearly never been used.TYLERSo what's with the ash tray?THE RECEPTIONISTIt completes the room.Tyler takes a long drag, grinding out the ember on the

     and rich wood, breathing power. There's a flat screen
     computer, but no personal effects anywhere.Charles sits at his massive desk. As Tyler enters, Charles
     registers his injuries. A flicker of something over Charles'

     businessmen and women. He's writing in his Journal, his foot
     tapping fast. We see the very act of writing eases him,
     loosening his strangled grip on the pen, slowing down the
     manic rhythm of his foot.28.25   EXT. PRIVATE SCHOOL. JUST AFTER.                            25It's just after three, Caroline emerges from school in a
     CLUSTER OF 6TH GRADE GIRLS. One of them dips her head towards
     Caroline's ear, as if to share a secret. Whatever she says
     makes Caroline's face crumble, almost to tears, and the girls
     snicker.Tyler hops from his perch on a parked car. His bike leans on
     a fire hydrant.TYLER(to Caroline)
               Hey.He looks at the girls, sizing them up, and flicks his
     cigarette to the sidewalk, cool as hell. The girls have a

               otherwise acting like human beings.

          general direction?Aidan holds a MATH TEXTBOOK at an awkward angle to mask his
obvious interest in Ally and Tyler's conversation.ALLYSubtle.TYLERI have this theory that an
          objective third-party, having no
          prior contact, would be able to

          he is just by looking at him.ALLYAh.TYLERHe's my roommate. And I've
          witnessed so many glaring examples

     neck. Suddenly, Tyler throws her to the bed. He takes
     control. Ally's momentarily taken aback, but doesn't stop

     frozen in the ancient freezer. There's got to be six inches
     of frost in there. She starts stabbing it with a wooden
     spoon. As she hears the door, she turns and puts on her most
     blistering attitude like an overcoat. As Tyler walks into the

     eyes widen...80.ALLYOh my God.She runs to him, he falls into her. He's a mess. He won't let

     completely lost in the storm and Alicia Santana Craig is
     going to get him through.ALLYOkay.She yanks his head up.ALLYIt's okay.They kiss. She brings his hands up into her hair, around her
