		demonstrates the etude for him, he places a thumb
		in his mouth and leans against her arm.ON THE METRONOME at an andante rhythm. CARL and
		TITA, now in their teens, are seated side by side

		respect: Nicholas steps out into the aisle and,
		followed by Tita, Carl and HERBERT, moves down

		earth, then lifts up into the air, revealing Bobby
		in hard-hat and heavy gloves, operating the levers.
		As the hoe swings off to the side and deposits a
		load of earth into the rear of a truck...... a SERIES OF SHOTS begins, showing Bobby and a
		fellow hard-hat (ELTON) engaged in the dirty and
		dangerous task of working "crew" with a team of
		TOOL-PUSHERS on the derricks of Signal Hill.
		Functioning as servants of the well and its pumps,
		the PULL rods, MAKE and BREAK joints on the rig
		floor, WELD tubing, CARRY pipes, CLIMB the "tour,"
		and PLAY THE DOZENS on beer wagon breaks.INT. BOBBY'S CAR - SIGNAL HILL - NIGHTABOVE SONG OVER:Bobby, still in his hard hat, as he drives. Out

		staring morosely across the room, to:A PORTABLE STEREO,playing the song:WYNETTE (V.O.)"And if you love him/Oh be proud of
			him/For after all, he's just a
			man..."RAYETTE DIPESTO,in a waitress's uniform with a bowl of beer nuts.
		After placing them on the coffee table in front of
		him, she leans down and kisses him. Challenged by a
		less than reciprocal response, she kisses him more
		fervently. As she moves her lips from his ear to
		his neck, he lifts the can to his mouth and drinks.WYNETTE (V.O.)"Stand by your man/And show the
			world you love him/Keep giving all
			the love you can/Stand by your
			man."The song concludes, and setting aside her ardor for
		the moment:RAYETTE(Arky accent)
			I'm gonna play it again...As she starts for the stereo, he takes hold of her
		hand.BOBBYYou're not going to play it again.RAYETTEWell, lemme play the other side
			then.BOBBYNo.Again, he prevents her from moving to the stereo
		and pulls her down onto the couch.RAYETTENow quit, Bobby. You said you're
			goin' a help me pick a song.BOBBYYou said.RAYETTEWell, lemme sing the one I picked
			an' see what you think...
				(she sings)
			"When there's a fire in your
			heart/Break the glass/Sound the
			alarm..."He picks up one of the couch pillows and holds it
		over his ear.RAYETTEOh, you prick...She pulls it from his hand.RAYETTEHow 'bout if I just cut off your
			damn water?BOBBYI'm too moved by your gentility to
			speak.She immediately softens and tries to become more
		"refined."RAYETTESugar, you know how I feel about
			you, don't you? I'm just tryin' to
			get you to take an interest in my
			kind a things, an' what I'm tryin'
			to do with myself...
				(bringing her face close
				to his)
			You know, there id'n anything in
			the world I wouldn't do for you,
			baby. I started livin' the day I
			found you, you know that?BOBBYYou're playing the other side.Very hurt, she sits up and looks away from him. He
		finishes the beer and holds the can out to her.BOBBYCerveza.RAYETTE(grabbing it from him)
			Serveza yourself!BOBBYNow, now.RAYETTE(she stands up)
			No, dammit, I would easy.And, as she turns and goes toward the kitchen:BOBBYBut you heal fast.Through the open door to the kitchen, Rayette can
		be seen opening the refrigerator. She takes out a
		can of beer and returns to Bobby.RAYETTE(over the above)
			You can play the piano, an' your
			whole damn family can play on some
			type a musical instrument. An' all
			I'm askin' is for you to listen to
			my singing for one single little
			second...She hands him the can and sits back down on the
		couch.RAYETTEBut you think you would? No, you're
			too damn selfish...He gestures at the name tag on her dress, and, as
		we'll find he often does, speaks in the Okie-Arky
		accent he's learned from working the rigs:BOBBYWhy'nt you take 'at sign off your
			tit, Ray, an' let's go on out.RAYETTEOut where?She sits down and begins removing the tag.BOBBYI don't know, I'll holler up Elton
			an' Stoney...She thinks about it, then moves closer to him and
		begins unbuttoning his workshirt, as:RAYETTEI'll go out with you, or I'll stay
			here, and do anything you'd like
			for me to do... if you'll just do
			one thing. If you'll tell me that
			you love me.BOBBYYou can sing the song.RAYETTE(annoyed)
			You know what, you are never
			satisfied.BOBBYThat's right, hand.The response makes her deeply insecure and she
		immediately lays her body against his...RAYETTEOh, now, baby...... and initiates another round of kissing.INT. BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHTBobby lifts his ball from the return rack, moves to
		the lane and bowls a perfect strike. Making a self
		congratulatory gesture of triumph, he turns back
		to:Elton, seated at the scoring table. His wife,
		STONEY, is seated beside Rayette on the horseshoe
		banquette. As he addresses Rayette, we note that
		Elton's two front teeth are missing.ELTON(Okie accent)
			Your ball, Ray.RAYETTE(reluctant)
			Is this suppose to be fun?BOBBYGo on, get up there...She rises and moves to the rack.BOBBY (CONT'D)... and stay relaxed this time.Picking up ball, she moves to the head of the lane
		and slings it down the alley, watching hopefully
		as...... it rolls off to the right and takes only one
		pin.ON BOBBYas she moves to her second ball.BOBBYNow don't loft it, just release it
			like I told you.ON RAYETTEas she bowls the ball down the right-hand rut and
		comes back to the banquette, apologizing:RAYETTEThe ball's too heavy for me,
			honey...He looks past her to Stoney, about to bowl her
		ball.BOBBYIt's not the damn ball.And as Stoney bowls a strike, Rayette hugs his arm.RAYETTEI'm tryin', baby, so don't start
			gettin' mad now.BOBBYNo, I'm not mad at you, hand. It'll
			be all right. Just spot and follow
			through...And as Elton bowls a strike...BOBBY (CONT'D)(mumbling)
			Shit.He gets up and passes Elton on his way to the rack.BOBBY (CONT'D)Nice ball, El.Rayette, to Stoney as she watches Bobby prepare to
		bowl:RAYETTEId'n he somethin' to see?And as he makes another strike and returns to the
		banquette, she gets up and throws her arms around
		him. He returns her embrace, smiling over her
		shoulder at:Two heavily made-up young women (TWINKY and BETTY)
		taking possession of the adjacent lane. (Note that
		Betty is of diminutive proportions, while Twinky is
		Amazonian.)RAYETTE (CONT'D)Is it my turn again?BOBBYRight. Now show me a little
			somethin' this time, okay? Give me
			some form...He remains standing, watching as she throws another
		gutter ball and then comes back toward him, alibi
		ing:RAYETTEI can't help it, honey, the ball
			just keeps goin' cocky wobbly on
			me...BOBBYWill you just do what the hell I
			tell you...RAYETTEI did, didn' I, El?BOBBYYou got another ball comin'.She moves to the rack and, concentrating hard,
		advances down the lane and releases the ball. It
		rolls slowly down the center, hits at precisely the
		right spot and clears the pins.ELTONAtta boy, Ray!Ecstatic, she comes back to the banquette, seating
		herself beside Bobby and trying to solicit a
		response from him.RAYETTEThat was damn good, wad'n it? I
			finally did it...BOBBYYeah, great.
				(begins removing his
				bowling shoes)
			Why don't you throw Z's for 19
			frames, and then roll a strike on
			the last ball in the last frame of
			a losing game? Just wonderful.Turning to address the two young women over the
		back of the banquette.BOBBY (CONT'D)Wasn't it, ladies?TWINKY(pointing at herself)
			Are you talking to us?Rayette pulls off her rental shoes and throws them
		to the floor.RAYETTEI'm gonna go wait in the car.He stretches his arms out on the back of the
		banquette as though he intends to reside there
		awhile.BOBBYYeah, why don't you do that.She grabs her sling-back and her purse and as she
		gets up:STONEYWait an I'll I go with you,
			honey...As she picks up her belongings and follows Rayette:ELTON(changing his shoes)
			We gotta get on home an' relieve
			the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come
			on over.BOBBYOkay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for
			the beers...
				(hands him the bowling
				shoes)
			An' walk Rayette over with you,
			will you.Elton moves off and Bobby, now full of remorse,
		slumps into a depressed reverie. Beyond him, Betty
		and Twinky, can be seen, engaged in some discussion
		concerning him.A WAITRESS with a tray approaches and leans down to
		him.WAITRESSCan I get you anything else?BOBBYNo. How much do I owe you?WAITRESSFive'll do it.He takes some loose bills from his pocket and lays
		them on her tray. She thanks him and moves off. As
		he reaches down and pulls on one of his boots,
		Twinky approaches behind him and leans down over
		the back of the banquette.TWINKYWe been wantin' to ask you
			something. Are you the guy on YV?BOBBYAm I on TV?TWINKY(pointing lo Betty)
			She says you're the one that sells
			all the cars on TV.BOBBYWell, I don't claim to have sold
			'em all. They still have some left,
			I believe.Betty appears on the other side of the banquette.BETTYSee, I told you it was him...
				(then to Bobby)
			Your name's Donnie something,
			right?BOBBYI leave it to you.BETTYMy name is Shirley, but they call
			me Betty, and her name's Twinky.BOBBY(looking to Twinky)
			Twinky?BETTY(explaining)

				other)
			Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is
			nice talking to you girls. I just
			wish I had more time...BETTYThat's a wig you wear, isn't it?BOBBY(touching his hair)
			A wig?BETTYYeah, I told her it was you, but
			that you're wearing a wig, 'cause
			on TV you're mostly bald in the
			front.BOBBY(to Twinky)
			Your little friend's real sharp
			there...
				(to Betty)
			Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig
			on TV, because with two and a half
			million people watching you, you've
			gotta be sincere. I just like to
			wear it when I'm out slippin'
			around bowling alleys an' things
			like that. I think it gives me a
			little more class, don't you?TWINKYOh, definitely...BETTY(looking at his hairline)
			Yeah, but I can see a little bitty
			of the net up there, that's what
			give it away.TWINKYIt's so weird to see you in person,

		up a pencil and a score sheet.TWINKYI'm gonna give you our number,
			Donnie, just in case...
				(as she writes)
			We're both professionals, if you
			didn't guess.BOBBYWell, you seem very professional...TWINKY(handing the score sheet
				to him)
			I always tell everyone the same
			thing. I got rolled and beat up
			real bad recently, and since then
			it's two for one, an' I work
			strictly in tandem with Betty...He glances at the dwarfish Betty.BOBBYYeah, I can see how she'd come in
			handy.EXT. BOWLING ALLEY PARKING LOT - NIGHTRayette sits sulking in Bobby's car. He comes up to

		drinks from a bottle of beer.
		After a moment, a loud belch comes from Nicholas
		and Tita quickly requests:TITADon't laugh...She attempts to stifle her own amusement, as do
		Bobby and Catherine, then changes the subject:TITA (CONT'D)What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate
			anything...CARLI took some aspirin and it really
			upset my stomach.Catherine begins pouring the coffee.CATHERINEOne thing that's hard to understand
			is how you could have this

			without a second thought...BOBBYI gave it a second thought.Tita seats herself at the table, addressing Spicer:TITAHe looks tired to me, Spicer. I

		the room:CATHERINEI mean, how could you not play
			anymore? That's so strange to me...BOBBYI have played a few times. Here and

			once a rehearsal pianist for a Las
			Vegas musical revue.CATHERINEYou don't call that music, though.BOBBYOf course I do. It's music. You

		simultaneously vocalizing as he does.Though Tita and Catherine are amused, Carl winces
		disapprovingly and breaks into Bobby's act:CARLRobert, do you mind?BOBBYWhat?CARLNothing. Will you excuse us for a

		quickly turns back to the mirror.BOBBYYou think I'm a fake.CATHERINEI think it's what you think.BOBBYNo, it isn't what I think.CATHERINELook... You made a very calculated
			move, and then made me feel
			embarrassed for responding to you.
			That wasn't necessary.She moves away from him and he follows her.BOBBYYes, it was. You've made it clear
			that if I can cut a little piano, I
			might get a little response.CATHERINE(stops and turns to him)
			I don't think that's accurate...BOBBYUp to now, what I've been getting
			from you are meaningful looks over

			for the day after tomorrow, this is
			the day after tomorrow, and I am,
			unfortunately, seeing you... Now if
			you'll excuse me, I'd like to take
			a bath.She moves back to the dresser and as she begins
		searching through an array of bath oils on top of
		it, Bobby steps in beside her.BOBBYIt's convenient to fake looking for
			something right now, isn't it?CATHERINEI'm not faking anything. I'm

			What are you doing, screwing around

			be difficult for you.CATHERINEI'd like you to leave now. Is that
			direct enough?He makes no move to go.CATHERINE (CONT'D)You're not a serious person, by
			your own admission. And that may be
			interesting, but it doesn't
			interest me...Needing the safety of distance, she moves over to
		the windows next to the bed. Again, he follows
		after her.BOBBYSerious, that's what's important to
			you?CATHERINEYes, that's what's important to
			me...He takes her by the shoulders...BOBBYOkay, let's be serious...... and forces her onto the bed.CATHERINENo, don't do that...BOBBYShut up...He hesitates for a moment, full of things he wants
		to say and cannot. Catherine looks up at him,
		uttering a quiet challenge:CATHERINENo inner feeling.BOBBYThat's right.CATHERINEI don't believe vou.He leans down to her, begins kissing her. Her arms
		encircle him and laying back on the bed, she pulls

		and full of a lifetime of derelict feelings, a FADE
		OVER BEGINS, to:INT. CATHERINE'S BEDROOM - DAYCatherine and Bobby lie side by side. He watches

			most brilliant man I'd ever met...
			And I'm sure he was, because at
			that age, I hadn't met that many...
			But he was insidious, you know. He
			had me convinced that I was a
			mediocrity, musically, as a woman,
			as an intellect. But in this
			completely imperceptible, pleasant
			way, so that you weren't even sure
			he was doing it. Anyway, I just
