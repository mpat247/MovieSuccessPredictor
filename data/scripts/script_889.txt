    door, a decal: "CAPETOWN SANITORIUM." Two men dressed
    in the white uniforms of the sanitorium exit the farm-
    house; one gently guiding a rather frail, troubled
    woman toward the car; the other totes her suitcase.

    The V.O. of a young man narrates:YOUNG MAN (V.O.)There comes a time in everyone's
               life when they discover that the
               only person you can truly depend
               on is yourself. That the only
               real power anyone has to get
               anything done is the power of one.
               With any luck you can make it
               through a lot of years before you
               ever have to face the reality of
               that fact.

               It was a luxury I never had. I
               discovered it the year my mother
               had her nervous breakdown.

    One attendant holds the rear door of the car open for
    the woman. Before entering, she turns one last time
    toward the farmhouse.2   HER POV                                                   2A young BOY looking one part scared, one part sad, and
    one part lost stares back at her, his hand held by a
    large, amiable black woman with tears rolling down her
    round cheeks.YOUNG MAN (V.O.)I was all of six.3.3   BACK TO SCENE                                                3The woman enters the car. The car drives off down the
    road. The Boy watches it disappear behind a plume of
    swirling dust.YOUNG MAN (V.O.)My father died before I was born,
              and even though I was raised by
              my Zulu nanny, with my mother,
              depending on her health, in
              nominal attendance, it was
              decided, with her departure, that
              I, too, would depart...
                     (beat)
              ... for boarding school.

    The dust the Boy has been watching reverses itself.
    An unseen vehicle comes up the road.YOUNG MAN (V.O.)But before I could be sent out
              into the world one very serious
              matter had to be dealt with.
                     (beat)
              I was a chronic bedwetter. Since
              my nanny was the one responsible
              for my well-being, she did what
              any responsible Zulu mother would
              do. She called on the greatest
              medicine man of her tribe --
              Inkosi Inkosikazi.

    Out of the dust a large black Buick ROADMASTER ROARS up
    the road and into the yard, scattering chickens and
    geese, stopping in front of the wide-eyed six-year-old
    and his tremulous nanny. A huge Zulu jumps out of the
    front passenger seat and opens the rear door. A moment
    passes, and then two splayed, cracked feet descend from
    the car and settle into the dust. INKOSI INKOSIKAZI,
    100 years old, small, black, wizened, hair and beard
    whiter than cotton, a leopard skin draped over his
    shoulders, a beaded fly switch in one hand, a trussed
    chicken in the other, exits the car.CUT TO:4   EXT. YARD - NIGHT                                       4A fire burns bright in the black African night. The Boy
    sits holding the chicken, close by the fire, while Inkosi
    Inkosikazi shuffles around him, drawing a circle in the
    dust with a stick.4.YOUNG MAN (V.O.)Legend had it that Inkosi
               Inkosikazi was the last son of
               the great Zulu king, Dingaan,
               who fought both the Boers and
               the British to a standstill
               nearly 100 years before, and the
               night Inkosi Inkosikazi was
               conceived stars fell from the
               sky until the sun rose.
    The circle    complete, the old man sits down opposite the
    Boy. From     a leather pouch he produces several bones. He
    throws the    bones on the ground and studies them for a
    moment. He     begins to wave the fly switch back and forth
    in front of    the Boy's eyes, chanting low, softly. The
    Boy's eyes    grow heavy; his lids droop.5   DREAM - EXT. WATERFALL                                     5The Boy and the old man are standing above a great
    waterfall. In the swirling pool far below are ten
    stepping stones linking one bank to the other.YOUNG MAN (V.O.)The medicine man instructed me to
               jump off the falls and climb along
               the ten stepping stones, counting
               as I went until I reached dry
               land.

    The Boy jumps, cascading down the   falls and into the pond
    below.  He clambers up the first   rock. It is slippery.
    He falls off and climbs back on,   buffeted by the spraying
    water.  He makes his way stone by   stone toward the other
    side.YOUNG MAN (V.O.)Even though it was only a dream,
               I felt as if my struggle to reach
               dry land was terrifyingly real.
               The water was like ice, bone-
               chilling, cold, and as I made my
               way from one stone to the next I
               could feel my strength desert me.
    The progress from one step to the next gets progressively
    harder as the Boy keeps slipping into the swirling water,
    coughing and sputtering.YOUNG MAN (V.O.)I was three rocks in when I ran
               out of gas. I couldn't pull myself
               any further. No matter how hard I5.tried, the current tried harder.
              I felt myself going under for the
              last time.

    The Boy's grip slips off the rock.   He starts to go
    under.CUT TO:6   EXT. FARMYARD - DAWN                                       6The fire has gone out. The Boy is still sitting in the
    circle, the chicken still in his lap. His eyes snap
    open. The first thing he sees is Inkosi Inkosikazi
    sitting across from him with a big smile.CUT TO:7   EXT. YARD - DAY                                            7Inkosi Inkosikazi enters the Buick. The Boy and his
    smiling nanny watch. They Boy still holds the chicken.YOUNG MAN (V.O.)Inkosi Inkosikazi said the spirit
              of the great Zulu warriors lived
              in me. He told me that whenever
              trouble arose I should return to
              the waterfall and keep stepping
              across the rocks until the trouble
              passed. He said three rocks were
              enough to conquer my problem with
              the night water; that I was very
              brave. He said I was a man for
              all Africa, bound to her by my
              spirit, bound by my dreams.
                     (beat)
              And he let me keep the chicken.

    The Boy and his nanny watch the car go off in a cloud of
    dust.CUT TO:8   EXT. VELDT - DAY                                           8The Boy sits on a train looking out the window at the
    veldt and the wildlife moving across in the distance.

    A sack on his lap moves. The chicken's head pops out.
    The Boy gives him some kernels of corn and scratches
    behind his scraggly comb.YOUNG MAN (V.O.)Although I was bound by spirit6.and dream to Africa, I was bound
               by heritage and language to the
               birthplace of my grandparents --
               England -- a country I had never
               seen, but one that was to cause
               me eminently more problems than
               bedwetting ever did.CUT TO:9    EXT. ROAD TO SCHOOL                                        9A motorcar driving along the road to the school.YOUNG MAN (V.O.)The school I   was sent to was
               attended and   staffed entirely by
               Afrikaaners,   the oldest of the two
               white tribes   of Africa.CUT TO:10   INT. SCHOOL                                                10The six-year-old walks timorously through the halls,
     filled with bigger boys -- brash, noisy, hostile. They
     only speak the "Taal" -- Afrikaans. Over and over they
     jostle or verbally deride the six-year-old, knocking his
     books down so that when he bends to pick them up he is
     kicked in the butt. Or pulling his shirt out from under
     his jacket and making it hard to move.YOUNG MAN (V.O.)I spoke only English. The hated
               tongue. The language of the enemy
               who had usurped power and stolen
               the country through political
               chicanery and military brutality.

     A mob of boys, led by a big bully, JAAPIE BOTHA, runs
     the six-year-old through the bathroom and into the
     showers, fully clothed. He tries to run out. Jaapie
     Botha grabs him and throws him back in, holding him with
     one ham-fisted hand under the shower head and turning the
     shower on with the other. The six-year-old stands
     miserable as the stinging water pelts him.YOUNG MAN (V.O.)During the Boer War of 1896,
               26,000 Boer women and children
               were herded into detainment camps
               by the British, where they died
               like flies from dysentery,7.malaria and black water fever.
               And it seemed I was destined to
               shoulder the responsibility for
               each and every one of those
               deaths.
     The six-year-old in his first soccer game receives the
     ball. He tries to move  upfield, but he is kicked and
     pushed, the ball taken from him. He gets up gamely to
     follow the chase, only to be flattened, blindsided by
     Jaapie Botha.YOUNG MAN (V.O.)And no one made this more evident
               to me than Jaapie Botha, a wheat
               farmer's son from the Transvaal.CUT TO:11   INT. DORMITORY                                                11The six-year-old, asleep, his chicken perched alertly
     atop the bed.YOUNG MAN (V.O.)The only time I was at peace was
               when I slept. Inkosi Inkosikazi's
               chicken proved to be, like his
               previous owner, a salvation.CUT TO:12   EXT. REAR OF DORMITORY - DAY                                  12The Boy builds a small shelter for the CHICKEN, who
     CLUCKS and forages contentedly.YOUNG MAN (V.O.)During the day he would live
               outside the dorm, happily scarfing
               down bugs and grubs, secure in a
               little house I built for him.CUT TO:13   INT. DORM - NIGHT                                       13YOUNG MAN (V.O.)And at night he would hop through
               the window and, perching over my
               bed, squawking if any intruders
               came near.8.Several boys sneak up in the    dark. The CHICKEN begins
     to CHATTER. The six-year-old     wakes, a shoe in hand
     ready to throw. The shadows     scatter. The Boy gives the
     chicken a few grains of corn    and an affectionate scratch
     behind the ear, and goes back    to sleep.YOUNG MAN (V.O.)He was my best and only friend.CUT TO:14   INT. SCHOOL                                                   14Boys and faculty running through the halls excitedly,
     showing newspapers with pictures of Hitler and
     Chamberlain on the front. Posters and slogans with
     swastikas are slapped up on walls. Some boys mimic
     "heiling" to each other.YOUNG MAN (V.O.)I'm sure in time a status quo
               would have been achieved between
               me and my schoolmates were it not
               for the cataclysmic events
               occurring in that faraway place
               none of us had ever seen.

               Two montjhs after I arrived at
               the school World War II broke out
               in Europe. Hitler had vowed to
               crush the British Empire. The
               Boers sharpened their swords in
               anticipation.
     The six-year-old comes back to his bed in the dorm to
     find a swastika carved into it.CUT TO:15   INT. DORMITORY - NIGHT                                        15The six-year-old sleeps fitfully. There is a MUFFLED
     SQUAWK. He wakes. A blanket is thrown over his head.CUT TO:16   INT. DARKENED BASEMENT ROOM                                   16The Boy is dumped on the floor, the blanket removed. His
     eyes open in horror. The room is lit by torches.
     Shadows dance fearfully off two dozen boys with swastika
     armbands and leather pistol rigs without pistols strapped
     to their sides. In front of him on a platform Jaapie
     Botha stands, his shirtsleeves rolled to the shoulder,9.as another student painfully tattoo-scars his arm with
a swastika, using a knife and blue dye. Seeing the six-
year-old, Jaapie turns his attention to him and
addresses him in Afrikaans.JAAPIEGod has sent Hitler to deliver us
          from the English bastards who stole
          our country and killed our people.
          Heil Hitler!
The other boys chorus in.ALLHeil Hitler!JAAPIEWe will swear a blood oath. When
          Hitler comes we'll rise up and
          kill the Verdomde Rooineks.ALLA blood oath!    A blood oath!
Jaapie bends down and grabs the six-year-old by the
shirt front, yanking him up.JAAPIEWith your blood.

Jaapie slaps the Boy across the mouth three times.
Blood flows from his mouth and nose. Jaapie dips his
finger in the blood and smears it across his new tattoo.
He holds up his bloodied fingers.JAAPIEWe swear allegiance to Adolf
          Hitler. Heil Hitler!ALLWe swear allegiance to Adolf
          Hitler. Heil Hitler!JAAPIEDeath to all Englishmen in South

The chorus repeats.JAAPIEGod bless the fatherland.    Heil
          Hitler!

The voices come back to him stronger.10.ALLHeil Hitler!

     Jaapie grabs the six-year-old again.JAAPIESee what we have in store for
               you when Hitler comes, Rooinek.
               Hoy!

     He gives a command. The boys at the far end of the
     room part. The six-year-old's eyes open in terror.17   HIS POV                                                       1720 feet away Inkosi Inkosikazi's chicken, his chicken,
     is hung from a rafter upside down, haplessly flapping
     against his bonds.18   BACK TO SCENE                                                 18BOYNo!

     But before he gets two steps towards the chicken he is
     gang-tackled and held. Jaapie picks up a sling and a
     rock.JAAPIEFor crimes committed against the
               whole Boer people. I, Jaapie
               Botha, the judge and Uberfuhrer,
               sentence you and your Rooinek
               kaffir chicken to death. Heil
               Hiter.!ALLHeil Hitler!

     Jaapie starts to swing the sling around and around.     The
     six-year-old struggles to get free.ALLHeil Hitler!   Heil Hitler!
     The SLING WHISTLES through the air, faster and faster.BOYNo!
     Jaapie releases the stone. It flies true, catching
     the SQUAWKING, struggling CHICKEN flush in the chest.
     The flapping stops as blood soaks through feathers.11.Jaapie flings his hand forward, victorious.JAAPIEHeil Hitler!ALLHeil Hitler!

The Boy takes the opportunity to break loose. He rushes
Jaapie, whose arm is outstretched, putting him off
balance. The Boy catches him low, driving his head into
Jaapie's exposed stomach. Jaapie falls back and gets
the knife used for his tattooing right in his ass.
Jaapie Botha bellows like an enraged bull as he grabs
futiley for the embedded blade. His cohorts laugh,
thinking it tremendously funny, until Jaapie removes
the knife and turns with it, dripping his own blood, his
eyes murderous. The laughter dies. Jaapie's breath
comes hard.JAAPIEHang him up!

A few boys protest.BOYSJaapie!   No!

But Botha is murderous, intent on revenge.JAAPIEHang him!

He waves the bloody knife in the air. Three boys grab
the six-year-old and drag him to where the chicken is
hanging. Two more boys throw a rope over the same
rafter. Others bind the struggling boy, trussing his
hands to his sides.JAAPIEYou will pay for the deaths of
          our grandfathers and grandmothers,
          our aunts and uncles. All
          Rooineks will pay and you will be
          first. Pull!

The boys who tied the rope now yank it over the rafter.
The six-year-old is hoisted up until he is eye-level with
the chicken.JAAPIEIn the name of Adolf Hitler and
          the fatherland, I sentence you to

     let the rock fly the door to the room opens and two STAFF
     MEMBERS burst in, surprising in.STAFF MEMBERWhat's this?

     The rock flies from the sling, but Jaapie's attention is
     diverted. His aim is off. The rock grazes the boy above

He shoves Morrie playfully out the door and follows.CUT TO:16.22   INT. LONG HALLWAY - CLOSEUP - PK AND MORRIE           22as they walk down the long   hall looking straight ahead.
     Sweat dapples PK's face.    Both boys are focused on
     double doors at the end of   the hall. There is the
     distant MUFFLED sound of a   CROWD CHEERING.MORRIEYou hear Sutcliffe screwed
               Bartlett's sister when he stayed
               with them over holidays?PKI don't believe it.MORRIEI heard it from Bartlett's own

               holiday.

     The CHEERING crowd grows LOUDER the closer they get to
     the double doors.MORRIEYou nervous?PKNo.MORRIEChrist! I'm about to have a calf.
               This bloody Boer gets lucky,
               we're in the poorhouse.
     They reach the double doors. Still in CLOSEUP, Morrie
     turns to face PK for the first time.MORRIENow remember. We're not here to
               exhibit our wares. We go in, we
               do the job, we get out. Right?

     PK is so focused his eyes seem to bore through the doors.
     He does not move his head a hair.PKRight.17.Morrie and PK draw a deep breath. Together they push
open the double doors. Together they stride into a
floodlit, fully-packed sports arena and head down the
fan-lined aisle to the raised boxing ring in the center.
Schoolboys in their respective school blazers, Afrikaan
and English, yell, whistle and clap. PK and Morrie,
in FULL FRAME, reveal PK in a boxing robe with taped
hands, and Morrie with towel and bucket.ANNOUNCERAnd at the end of six matches in
          all weight divisions, the score

The stands explode with cheers.ANNOUNCERAnd now for the final bout to

          pounds, standing 5'8", from the
          Helpmakeer School with a record of
          13-0 on the year, Jannie
          Geildenhaus.
A huge cheer goes up for JANNIE, muscular, bare-chested,
as he dances and shadowboxes for the crowd.

PK enters the ring. He stands, robe on, eyes intent on
Jannie. When the noise subsides the Announcer continues.ANNOUNCERAnd in this corner, representing
          the Prince of Wales School, the

          140 pounds, Kid P.K.

Now the English schoolboys cheer for their man, but PK
does not respond. He barely moves. He raises an arm in
bare acknowledgment. His attention stays focused across
the ring on his shadowboxing opponent. PK watches Jannie
dance closely when a low CHANTING begins from outside the
stadium -- African, tribal, mystical harmonies of black
voices building until the white voices inside the stadium
are stunned to silence. The song carries beautifully in
the night. For the first time PK's focus is broken, but
not like the others in the audience, who haven't a clue
as to what's happening. He has heard this before. This
is familiar.18.This is for him. A distant knowing flickers in his eyes
     like a man who has heard the voice of fate whisper his
     name.

     Over and over, one phrase is indistinguishable -- the
     chorus of the song. "Ono  bi shobi ingelosi." The
     chanting stops as suddenly as it began. A moment passes
     before the crowd begins to buzz with the phenomenon.

     The Announcer attempts to bring everyone's attention
     back to the business at hand.ANNOUNCERWe thank the native population for
               their spirited display of
               enthusiasm. But now, on to the

               ring, please.

     PK, focused again, meets Jannie at the REFEREE.REFEREEYou both know the rules.     No

               clean fight. Good luck     to you.
     The fighters slap leather. PK turns back to his corner
     when his focus is broken dramatically by a face in the
     crowd.23   HIS POV - FRONT ROW - HALF-DOZEN SCHOOLGIRLS               23sit; one of them MARIA ELIZABETE MARAIS, 17, with honey-
     blonde hair and lapis-blue eyes, turns her head and
     engages PK's eyes and his heart. She quickly looks
     away. But a  connection has been made -- fire passed.24   PK                                                         24goes back to his corner and takes off his robe.   Morrie
     stands, holding PK's mouthpiece.PKFirst row, third from the left.

     Morrie looks down at Maria.MORRIEWe're in a bloody war here, in19.case you forgot. Let's keep our
               mind on that, hey?

     He jams the mouthpiece into PK's mouth as the BELL RINGS.
     PK turns to an onslaught by Jannie, a real brawler.
     Jannie's big, overhand rights almost nail PK until he
     finds his footing and dances away. Jannie comes after
     him hard, his schoolmates bellowing encouragement. But
     PK's far superior boxing skills put Jannie at an immed-
     iate disadvantage. It is a classic battle of a boxer
     versus a fighter. PK's jabs keep Jannie at an arm's
     length, until he closes with a combination. Jannie,
     willing to take three punches to land one, absorbs PK's
     point scoring combinations and tries to land knockout
     punches. When he has had enough punishment he lunges
     into a clinch.JANNIEBlery Rooinek.     I'll kill you.

     PK pushes off as Jannie hammers at his kidneys. Backing
     up, PK repays the compliment with two quick jabs to the
     face. PK works Jannie, turning him left then right,
     working the angles, keeping him off balance while he
     racks up the points. Jannie goes left. As PK chases
     him that way his eyes fix on something out of the ring.25   HIS POV - REAR EXIT DOOR - TALL BLACK MAN                   25with a younger black companion of more average height,

     that split second Jannie    seizes the opportunity. He
     comes across with a big    right hand to PK's jaw. Jannie
     connects. PK goes down     hard. The crowd goes wild.
     Morrie leaps up and down    in the corner.MORRIEGet up!     Get up!

     But PK is seeing double.    He shakes his head, trying to
     clear it.MORRIEUp!   Up!27   PK'S POV - JANNIE                                      27dancing in his corner, sensing victory, the Ref over20.him, counting.28   BACK TO SCENE                                             28PK forces himself up.   The Ref checks him.REFEREEOkay.   Fight.

     Jannie comes rushing in, banging PK with a series of
     hard rights, but dropping his left each time he throws
     one. PK absorbs the punishment as best he can, backing
     up, dancing away. Jannie is all over him just as the
     BELL RINGS. Jannie goes back to his corner, triumphant.
     PK goes back to his and sits down with a blank ex-
     pression. Morrie goes to work on a small cut over
     his eye.MORRIEWhat are you trying to do,
               bankrupt us? What happened?

     PK turns and looks at the two Africans at the rear door.
     Morrie's eyes follow him, tensing as he sees the two men.MORRIEChrist! If they get caught in
               here they're dead.

               when he throws the right?MORRIEYeah?

     The BELL RINGS. PK and   Morrie trade a look. Jannie
     comes rushing over and  throws a big right. PK steps to
     his own right side and  pops Jannie right over his dropped
     left hand. He looks at   Morrie again.21.29   ANGLE ON MORRIE                                            29MORRIEThank you, God.

     Jannie comes after PK, paying for each big right he
     throws as PK finds his mark. PK plants one, then two,
     then three punches on Jannie's face. Finally, frus-
     trated, Jannie forsakes all pretense of boxing and tries
     to nail PK with wild, flailing blows. PK bobs and weaves
     and feints. Jannie's punches grow weary. PK begins
     to bear down, driving his man back with rapid-fire com-
     binations until he delivers the coup de grace, a left
     hook to the heart and a driving right uppercut. Jannie
     goes down in a heap. The crowd goes wild. The Referee
     counts him out. Jannie's seconds rush into the ring to
     lift their fallen fighter. Morrie also rushes in,
     followed by the Prince of Wales boxing team. They hoist
     PK up on their shoulders.30   PK'S POV - MARIA MARAIS                                    30rising from her seat, and leaving with the other girls.

     raucous celebration. Morrie comes bouncing through the
     crowd, until he enters the empty dressing room in the
     rear, where PK is getting dressed. Morrie takes a wad
     of money out of his pocket.MORRIEHere you go, pal.

     African moonlight. A security guard mans the front gate.
     PK takes a route through shadows and shrubs, searching
     for a way in. He finds one in a tree whose massive limbs
     reach over the wall. In a flash PK is up the tree and
     over the wall.CUT TO:34   EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS                                        34PK makes his way through the darkened campus. A few stu-

     with towels and toiletries and step into the       same room.

               separate tribes, ay?28.PKUnfortunately.MARAISWhy do you say that?PKBecause it's the whole tribal
idea that creates our problems
here in South Africa.MARAISThe problems of South Africa, my
boy, do not come from tribalism.
They come from counter-tribalism.
From people insisting that natural
laws which have been in place and
operating since God's creation,
should be tampered with. Does
the gazelle sleep with the lion?
Does the rhino graze with the
mouse? The separation of things
is not coincidental. Do you think
a Zulu wants to see his culture,
his sense of identity, replaced by
someone else's anymore than I do?PKNo, sir. But I don't think he
wants being a Zulu to mean he is
denied the same rights as
everyone else has.MARAISWhich is why civilization is
defined by the ability to live
under the rule of law. Laws
define rights.PKBut do they define justice?MARAISAh. Justice. The banner behind
which the English marched as they
gobbled up a quarter of the world?
Justice, my boy, is only relative
to who's in charge.PKAnd how long they stay in charge

dispense that justice...

          to see my daughter. Correct?PKYes, sir.MARAISAnd knowing  who I am, what I stand
          for, do you  think this sort of

          reputation wouldn't want his
          daughter seeing someone who didn't

          You're right. I admire a keen
          mind.  But intellectual reputation

     On the rock, a seven-year-old PK sits looking somewhat
     sadly over the landscape. A long shadow covers him.

               original thought. In school you
               will get all filled up with the
               facts. Here your brain will learn
               where to look, how to look, how
               to think. And then you will have
               for yourself all the brains that
               have ever been.

               successful career as a concert
               pianist all over Europe. On his

               represent Him, I think He would

               blessings He tried but failed to
               give man. It is true. Look.
               The cactus is humble but not
               submissive. It grows where no
               other plant will grow. The sun
               bakes its back, the wind rips it
               from cliffs, or drowns it in the
               dry desert sand. Not a complaint.
               In good times or bad it will
               still flower. It protects itself

          like those nice school fights
          you're used to. Three knockdowns
          you win.

Just then, as if to underscore his point, one of the
fighters in the ring gets caught witha solid shot to the
jaw. He hits the canvas inches from where they are
standing. Solly, PK and Morrie all look at him, and then
at each other.MORRIEWhat does it cost for you to train
          him?SOLLYFor my personal attentinons, Mr.
          Manager? Fifty pounds a month.

Morrie pulls out a wad of money and proffers it to Solly.MORRIEHere's for six months in advance.
          Three hundred pounds.
Solly pushes the money back.SOLLYSix months? I don't know your
          boy'll last six minutes.PKI'll last.

Solly notices that every black fighter in the gym has
stopped working and is staring at PK.SOLLY41.What are you staring? Punch,
          don't stare. C'mon. Work or
          you're out.

The blacks go back to work.SOLLYThat your gear?PKYes, sir.SOLLYGo change in the back. We'll see
          if you couldn't find a better use
          for all that money.PKThank you, sir.

PK heads towards the rear.      Solly turns to Morrie.SOLLYWhy's he want to do this, a nice-
          looking schoolboy?MORRIEHe wants to be welterweight champ
          of the world.

Solly breaks up laughing.SOLLYOh sure, sure. And I'd like to
          be twenty-five again.MORRIEYou like to make book on it?SOLLY(joking)

     opponent. Morrie stands at ringside with Solly.SOLLYLet's just start out nice and
               easy now.

     He hits the bell. The fighters circle. PK's opponent
     starts punching, jabbing, probing. After two feints he
     comes after PK in earnest. PK steps left and peppers
     him with three quick blows to the face. Solly's interest
     is suddenly piqued. Again the fighters circle. Again
     the opponent sets up with jabs and again he attacks.
     This time PK dodges, hits him hard and spins him around,
     hitting him twice more. A smile appears on Solly's face.
     The opponent, angered now, gets more aggressive. PK
     keeps bobbing and weaving, sticking and slipping punches.
     The opponent unloads, banging away at PK with everything
     he has. PK backs up two steps, then shifts positions.
     The opponent's momentum carries him into the ropes. As
     he comes off the ropes PK throws him an eight-punch
     combination, demolishing his opponent. PK steps back.
     The opponent sags. Solly hits the bell, clearly excited.SOLLYNever I seen someone so young
               throw an eight-punch combination.
               Where did you learn such a thing?PKIn prison, sir.SOLLYYou trying to be a comedian and a

     Just then the sound of GRUNTING and THWACKING fills the
     air. PK passes a room set up as a boxing gym. Through
     a crack in the door he sees a dozen boys being coached
     by some guards. Some guards are also being coached by
     a second man. A third man, LIEUTENANT SMIT, oversees
     the whole training session. PK watches, mesmerized.VON ZYLYou like to box?PKI would like to learn, meneer.

     The group disperses. PK beckons the photographer to
     wait. He grabs Geel Piet and forces him to stand,
     much to the little man's protestations, for a photo
     of the two of them. As the picture is taken Geel

               Each prisoner entering the yard
               is searched. It was prison policy

     All the prisoners are seated on the ground behind Doc,
     who is raised with the piano on a small stage. Guards
     surround the prisoners -- a solid, edgy border encasing
     a black center. The front of the yard is filled with
     seats on which sit the Kommandant, his wife, assorted
     prison brass, politicians, and a smattering of the local
     Afrikaan Hierarchy. PK is overseeing the seating of the
     prisoners when Doc comes up to him.DOCHave you seen my page turner?PKNo.

     He turns the stage over to the professor and takes his
     seat. The professor sits at his stool, poised. PK, in
     front of the singers, watches him for a cue. Doc drops
     his head. PK points to a group of singers. MUSIC and
     VOICE blend spontaneously. "The Concerto for the Great
     Southland" begins.

     Doc plays magnificently with great style. PK focuses on
     leading the singers. Each section, each tribe singing
     its own songs with its own distinct cultural imprints on

     one. PK runs through the corridors. He runs through the
     kitchens, the empty dining area, the SOUND of the concert
     chasing after him.

     He runs through the recreation area and past the boxing
     room when he hears a THUD, and another.93   INT. BOXING ROOM                                           93He bolts into the room and hits the light switch. The

     scrambles into the ring and cradles the lifeless, blood-

      door does not open, locked from the outside.117.Bretyn smiles cruelly.BRETYNLocks keep people out but they
                 also keep them in.
      He has walked right up to Morrie, not taking his eyes
      off Morrie's for a moment. Morrie meets his gaze evenly.
      The moment is broken as Bretyn's baton slams into Morrie's
      stomach, dropping him to this knees.BRETYNGet up, you bloody commie Jew!
      He bangs Morrie hard in the jaw, knocking him out cold.BRETYNCaptain.
      The two police lines start to move towards each other,
      sandwiching the Africans, PK and Maria.

      Mandoma gives an order. The blacks pick up anything
      they can to face the inevitable--stools, chairs, a
      flagpole.PKNo.    Wait.   We'll leave.BRETYNToo late. You never should have

      into the man's ribs followed by another to his jaw.
      The man goes down.156   PK'S POV                                                  156118.Morrie has risen to take a policeman out with a stool

      through the air. Maria is caught flush on the forehead
      as she comes between PK and the club. She falls to
      the floor dead. PK swings a stool with all his might,
      breaking the cop's face open.PKMaria!

      PK drops to the fallen girl's side. He is frantic at
      the sight of her gaping bloody wound and the sight of
      her open blank eyes. The battle raging around him
      recedes before his pain and rising rage. All at once
      he explodes, screaming like a madman.

      He leaps at Bretyn and bangs one punch after another
      into the startled man. Bretyn's face is broken over and
      over against PK's fists. Still PK keeps pounding blow
      after blow into the fallen man.

      Three cops descend on PK and beat him mercilessly
      until he drops to the floor, unconscious.

      Mandoma is hit hard and goes down.

      up at PK.THOMASAre you crazy?     To sign on for

looks over as four huge men enter, drillers, men whose
faces and bodies are as hard and massive as the rock
they work.

One of the men pauses at the door and grabs his head as
an enormous jolt of pain runs through it. He shakes it
off and follows his friends to a table.

Thomas looks concerned.PKSomething wrong?THOMAS(unconvincing)

                bad enough. Mixed with a little

      As they reach the door the behemoth explodes with a
      roar. He grabs his head and staggers backwards; a mad
      look comes into his eyes.

      His three huge frineds rush to grab him.   He throws
      them off as if they were ants.

      He rips a table out of its bolting to the concrete
      floor and flings it across the room.
      The men drinking in the bar, all tough cases, begin to
      flee.

      behemoth struggles against his three massive friends
      and pulls him out of the bar.CUT TO:182   EXT. MINER'S CAMP - TWILIGHT                               182Pk is watching a rugby match being played at twilight.

      unconscious. Two of his teammates carry him off the

      PK comes down a side street. A half a dozen men at
      cards, hard-faced desperadoes, see him pass, eyeing him
      closely. PK averts his eyes. From behind his back
      comes the sound of LIPS PUCKERING loudly, indecently.
      PK swallows hard. The sound of a CHARGE turns him to
      the six men bolting from their card game after him,
      whooping with lascivious intent. PK takes off.

      The chase takes PK and his pursuers flying through the
      streets of the camp, past one identical cement hut after
      another.  People watch, disinterested. No one raises
      a hand to help.

      PK comes racing around the corner to three of the men132.blocking the street in front of him. He whirls. The
      others catch up behind, yelling and hooting. The two
      lines advance.

      PK gets ready. When the first man is close enough he
      hits him hard, breaking his jaw. He swings at another,
      catching him flush in the face. But then the rest are
      upon him. Even though PK fights like hell, he is
      overwhelmed. The blows come from everywhere, beating
      him to the ground. His arms and legs are firmly grabbed
      by four men. He is banged hard face down onto a concrete
      table. The fifth man pulls down his pants and the sixth
      begins to undo his own fly. All the men scream obsceni-
      ties, anticipating the rape.

      PK struggles like hell to no avail. As he is about to
      be violated, a roaring giant of a man tears into the
      pack like a bear shredding dogs. He scatters the men,
      knocking some unconscious, sending the rest to flight.
      He stands over PK, a looming block of granite with a
      wild black beard and coal-black eyes. His intent only
      becomes clear as to whether he is claiming a prize or
      helping a friend when he offers PK his hand, lifting PK
      effortlessly.

      He examines PK's bruised face with some concern and
      then smiles.PKYou know, Rasputin, I had them
                right where I wanted them.

      to Elijah. Elijah lights a cheesa stick. He hands the
      glowing stick to PK. PK waves towards the tunnel. One

Elijah nods.

PK holds his hand out for the cheesa stick. Elijah
lights the flare. He goes to hand it to PK. PK
notices Elijah's hands shaking. He sees the fear in
Elijah's eyes.PKGo on.ELIJAHI stay with you, baas.PKThat's an order.

Elijah, released from his responsibility, retreats

PK stands holding the flare, a little distracted by
Elijah's fear, wondering.
Elijah sounds the BLAST WHISTLE.PKOne... two... three.
A MUFFLED BLAST comes from the other side of the hangup
deep in the stope. PK freezes, confused, and then a
SECOND BLAST goes off. The hangups starts to give. AndANOTHER BLAST.PK lights his own fuse and runs like hell over the bars
toward the tunnel.
The hangup, loosened by the explosions inside, gives
before PK's bomb ignites. The rock is crashing down.
PK races the rock. The tunnel is within sight.

The men yell for him to jump.

PK is about to leap when a rock hits the bar, bounces up,
and catches him in the stomach. He  loses his balance
and goes over the side as the hangup comes crashing down.

powder-mad Botha.150.PK jumps out of the way at the last minute.

      his best to stay out of the charging giant's way.

      Botha charges him. PK sidesteps and hits him with a
      left hook. The punch has no effect. Botha swings out
      wildly. PK easily dances away. Botha picks up
      another table and heaves it at PK. PK jumps to avoid
      it, but trips on an overturned stool. He goes down.
      The miners outside, crowding three deep, yell and shout.
      People start to make bets.

      Botha charges PK as PK scrambles up. Botha swings. The
      blow glances off PK's shoulder and sends him flying,
      spinning over a table. Botha leaps at PK, driving him
      into the wall. PK grimaces, sagging. Botha picks him
      up and starts to squeeze him to death in his massive
      arms. PK, his hands free, starts to pound on Botha's
      ears with his palms. Botha screams as the powder head-
      ache accelerates through the top of his skull. He
      drops PK. PK rolls away and swings a stool at Botha's
      midsection. Botha is driven back. PK goes to swing
      the stool again. Botha catches it as if it were made
      of balsa. He rips it out of PK's hand and flings it
      back at him, charging behind it.

      PK goes topping end over end. Botha gets a hand on him
      and lifts him from behind. He flings PK over the bar.
      PK hits the floor, stunned. Botha pulls at the bar
      trying to get at PK.

      He rocks the bar and rocks the bar as PK is trying to
      regain his bearings. Finally, with one tremendous rip,
      the bar comes away from its bolting. Botha pulls it
      aside.

      PK rises just as Botha moves in. PK hits him three
      solid shots to the stomach but Botha hardly feels
      them. He grabs PK and starts to squeeze him again.

                 One.
