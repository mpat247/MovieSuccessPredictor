			    Sylvester StalloneRING PRODUCTIONS, INC.MASTER SCRIPT: INCLUDES ALL REVISIONS AS OF 1/7/76  REVISED:INT. BLUE DOOR FIGHT CLUB - NIGHTSUPERIMPOSE OVER ACTION... "NOVEMBER 12, 1975 - PHILADELPHIA"... The club itself resembles a large unemptied trash-can.
The boxing ring is extra small to insure constant battle.
The lights overhead have barely enough wattage to see who is
fighting.

In the ring are two heavyweights, one white the other black.
The white fighter is ROCKY BALBOA.  He is thirty years old.
His face is scarred and thick around the nose... His black
hair shines and hangs in his eyes.  Rocky fights in a
plodding, machine-like style.  The BLACK FIGHTER dances and
bangs combinations into Rocky's face with great accuracy.
But the punches do not even cause Rocky to blink... He grins
at his opponent and keeps grinding ahead.

The people at ringside sit on folding chairs and clamor for
blood... They lean out of their seats and heckle the fighters.
In the thick smoke they resemble spectres.  Everyone is
hustling bets... The action is even heavier in the balcony.
A housewife yells for somebody to cover a two dollar bet.

The BELL RINGS and the fighters return to their corner...
Somebody heaves a beer can into the ring.

The Black Fighter spits something red in a bucket and sneers
across the ring at Rocky.BLACK FIGHTER(to cornerman)
		... I'm gonna bust his head
		wide open!

In Rocky's corner he is being assisted by a shriveled,
balding CORNERMAN, who is an employee of the club... He
works on Rocky without any enthusiasm.CORNERMAN(lackluster)
		... Ya waltzin' -- Give the
		suckers some action.ROCKYHey --CORNERMAN(overriding)
		Ya movin' like a bum -- Want
		some advice --ROCKY... Just gimme the water.2.A FIGHT FAN rushes up to Rocky... He is sixty-five, with
yellow teeth and wearing sunglasses.FANShould I bet the fight don't
		go the distance -- Ya feel
		strong?ROCKYAbsolutely.CORNERMAN... Ya want some good advice?ROCKY... I just want the mouthpiece.

The BELL RINGS... Rocky makes the sign of the cross.  The
fighters engage in battle.  The other fighter grabs Rocky in
a clinch and purposely butts him... The butt opens a bleeding
cut on the corner of Rocky's eye.

Rocky becomes furious over the foul and drives a flurry into
the man's body... Rocky slams the man on the jaw and the
fighter is out for the night.  The fans throw rubbish into
the ring.  Rocky ignores it.

The fans loudly go about collecting bets.  The referee does
not bother to even count the fighter out and drags him under
the ropes where he is placed on a stretcher.  Two new
fighters enter the ring.  Rocky slips on a tattered robe.
Embroidered clumsily on the back is, "The Italian Stallion."ANNOUNCERWinner, Rocky Balboa -- Next a
		six rounder between local
		lightweights.

Without pomp Rocky climbs out of the ring and bums a
cigarette from a spectator... The fighter on the stretcher
passes behind him.  He watches for a moment and continues up
the aisle... Before he even reaches the rear of the club the
BELL RINGS and the next fight has already begun... Rocky
fades into the darkness of the rear of the club.THE TITLE CREDITS END:INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHTRocky has nearly completed dressing and reaches into his
locker for his hat... Also in the dingy room are ten other
fighters... Two taped fighters talk shop in the corner.3.FIGHTER #1... Tomorrow me an' my woman
		are gonna tip on down to
		Atlantic City, man.FIGHTER #2... It's cold, Bro'.FIGHTER #1... That's right, I got the
		city to myself...

Another paces nervously... Two other fighters shadowbox and
spit nervously on the floor.

A young pug combs his hair and listens to a portable RADIO
that is BLASTING MUSIC.

The fighter that Rocky has just defeated is drinking a beer
and joking with three other fighters... Some of the fighters
are smoking.  The room is cloudy.

A short man of fifty enters.  He is dressed in a sweater
buttoned over a t-shirt.PROMOTER...Balboa!?

Rocky raises his head.  The promoter steps over.PROMOTER(continuing)
		... Twenty bucks for the
		locker an' cornerman -- Two
		bucks for the towel an'
		shower, seven for tax -- The
		house owes ya, sixty-one
		dollars.

The man peels off the money and departs... Rocky closes his
locker, nods to the defeated fighter, and leaves.INT. TROLLEY - NIGHTRocky is on the trolley heading to South Philly... The
trolley is empty except for a thin old black WOMAN... The
black Woman studies Rocky's bruised face... Rocky becomes
self-conscious.ROCKY(almost apologetic)
		I'm a fighter.4.WOMAN(tired)
		... Yo' iz an accident.EXT. STREET - NIGHTRocky exits the trolley and walks down the block... He waves
at a pair of high-heeled hookers and they wave back.

Rocky passes a sleeping wino curled in front of a dirty
bookstore.  Rocky drags the man into a protective passageway.

Further down the street, Rocky pauses in front of the
"ANIMAL TOWN PET SHOP"... He peers into the dark store and
sees a sad, huge dog sitting in the window.  He mumbles to
the dog and continues to the corner.EXT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHTA short while later, Rocky approaches his apartment located
in the most deprived section of South Philly.  He kicks away
the litter that has gathered against the apartment steps and
enters.INT. ROCKY'S HALLWAY - NIGHTThe narrow hallway is painted olive brown.  A single light
bulb illuminates the gloomy corridor.INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHTRocky enters.  The one-room apartment is drab, with a
curling boxing poster of Rocky Marciano tacked on the wall...
Nailed against the far wall is a mattress.  The mattress is
used as a punching bag.  Stuffing spills out of the center.

Rocky drops his coat on the floor.  He puts on a pair of
glasses.  He crosses to a small turtle bowl... He lifts the
creatures.ROCKY...Look who's home.

Rocky starts to boil a pan of water on his hot plate, then
places an old 45 RPM record on a battered phonograph.  The
record is a tune, "ALL IN THE GAME."

... As the CRACKLING MUSIC BEGINS, Rocky picks up his
hairbrush.  Using it like a microphone, he mimes to the
record.  He assumes the posture of a famous singer crooning
to thousands of adoring fans... He then switches into a
bullish fighting stance and throws several punches.

The water boils.  Rocky soaks his badly-swollen hands.5.EXT. SUNRISE OF PHILADELPHIA SKYLINE - DAWNWe SEE the jagged skyline, highlighted by the towering
figure of William Penn that rises above the dawn haze as it
sits majestically above City Hall...EXT. DOCKS - EARLY MORNINGRocky is walking along the waterfront... He has a bandaid
over one eye.  He looks at the rugged stevedores going about
their business... He stuffs his hands in his cheap wool
jacket and approaches a ship being unloaded.

Rocky passes two thick Mafia types leaning against a parked
car.  These men look like blood drinkers.MAFIA #1Yo, Rock -- How's your Boss?ROCKYReal good.MAFIA #2Fightin' again?ROCKYYeah, here an' there.MAFIA #1Mebbe we make sum money
		togather soon... Give ya boss
		my best.

Rocky shrugs and moves away... He nears a heavy man working
the crane.  The heavy man looks frightened... He stops the
crane and hurries into the ship's hole.  Rocky dashes up the
gangplank.INT. SHIP - DAYThe man enters the ship's hole and runs past tons of stacked
crates and coffee beans.

Rocky sprints after him... He lunges and flings the man by
the neck against the wall of stacked cargo.FATS(terror-filled)
		Don't hit the face!  Not the
		face!!ROCKYMr. Gazzo wants the two
		hundred now!6.FATSHonest to God I'm broke --
		Gimme a break.ROCKYMr. Gazzo says I should get
		two hundred or break the thumb.FATSPlease, I need my hands to
		work -- Christ, don't bust my
		thumbs.

At wits' end the man picks up a large metal hook used by
stevedores.  Rocky remains cool.ROCKYGoin' fishin'?

The man drops the hook.ROCKYWhat's ya name again?FATSBob.ROCKYLook, Bob, if ya wanna dance,
		ya gotta pay the band -- If ya
		borrow, ya gotta pay the man...
		Me, I ain't emotionally
		involved.

Rocky's determined expression strikes home.  The fat man
quickly fumbles through his pockets and hands over a small
wad of bills.ROCKY(continuing; counting)
		A hundred an' thirty.FATSThat's it, I'm broke.ROCKYThat's it? -- Completely?FATSThat's it.ROCKYWhat about for food an' stuff?7.FATSYou have my food in ya hand.

Rocky looks almost sympathetically into the fat man's
flushed expression.ROCKY... The juice is climbin'
		every week.FATSI know the juice is climbin' --
		I been workin' six months just
		to pay the damn interest.ROCKYYa still light seventy.FATSWaits! -- Be smart.  Ya don't
		have to break nothin' -- Here,
		take my coat, it's worth
		fifty-sixty dollars.  It's
		yours.

The man quickly removes his coat and extends it...FATS(continuing)
		See, ya a smart guy, Gazzo's
		don't have to know nuthin'.
		I'll go tape up the hand like
		ya broke my thumb.  Gazzo
		won't be wise to nothin' -- Be
		a smart guy, keep the coat,
		we'll fake like ya broke the
		hand.

The man extends his coat again... Rocky suddenly grabs the
man's thumb and bends him to his knees.FATS(almost a whisper)
		No - no - no - Please -
		Please - Please don't...

Rocky releases the man who remains almost in shock.  The
thumb is fine.ROCKY...That's what coulda happened.
			(walks off.)8.EXT. STREET - DAYLater that morning Rocky passes "Animal Town Pet Shop" in
South Philly... The shop is not very prosperous looking.  In
the window hangs a sign reading "Today's special -- Mixed
Kittens -- $1.50"... Rocky stops at this shop every morning.
He stares at a litter of Lhasa Apsa puppies.  He taps the
window and whistles.  He SEES a girl behind the counter and
presses his face against the window and does his impression
of the Hunchback of Notre Dame.  The girl nervously looks
away.

The girl behind the counter is ADRIAN KLEIN.  She is not
very attractive, but pleasant-looking.  Thirty years old.
Brown hair pulled back.  Light skinned.  She wears glasses.

Rocky really stops by to flirt with Adrian, but she is so
painfully shy nothing ever gets started... Rocky enters.INT. PET SHOP - DAYADRIAN... Could you take the puppy
		out --CUSTOMERIt can breathe.ADRIANPlease -CUSTOMERPlease, nothin' - I paid for
		this dog and can do whatever I
		want with it - I can throw it
		through the window if I want -
		Now give me my two dollars
		back before I do throw it
		through the window.

Rocky walks over to her, stares hard in her face and snatches
the bag out of her hand.  He removes the puppy and hands it
to Adrian.CUSTOMERGet away from me - Give me that!

Rocky takes a couple dollars out of his pocket and hands it
to the lady... She nervously exits.ROCKY... How's the turtle food this
		week?9.ADRIAN... Fine.ROCKYMe, I'm kinda aggravated.ADRIAN... I'm sorry.ROCKYAin't your fault - Here's the
		problem.

Adrian nods... Though charmed, she is slightly intimidated.ROCKYThe last food I got here had
		more moths than flies -- An'
		the moths get caught in my
		turtle's throat -- That makes
		them cough --

The OWNER, a squat woman of forty, steps out of the back and
waves at Rocky.ROCKY(continuing)
		Yo, Gloria -- I was talkin'
		about the turtle food -- Like
		I was sayin', the moths get
		caught in the turtle's throat
		an' makes 'em cough...
			(coughs)
		A little cough an' I gotta
		smack 'em on the shell -- An'
		whatta think they get?

Adrian shrugs.ROCKY(continuing)
		I smack 'em hard on the shell
		an' they get... What?ADRIAN... I don't know.ROCKYShell-shocked!

Both the Owner and Adrian smile.10.OWNERStartin' with the bad jokes
		early today, huh.ROCKYInventin' jokes ain't easy.

Rocky steps over to a large cage at the rear of the shop...
Inside is a huge dog.ROCKY(continuing)
		How's Butkus this mornin'?OWNERAin't had time to check 'em.

Rocky opens the cage and the large dog jumps out and looks
very happy.ROCKYYo, Butkus -- Dead.  Play dead.

The dog plays dead.ROCKY...What kinda dog is this again?OWNERBullmastiff.ROCKYThe owner was suppose to pick
		him up three weeks ago.OWNERWe're not responsible for
		animals left over thirty
		days - We board it ain't a
		animal shelter, Y'know.
		...Adrian, I want you to clean
		all those cat cages downstairs,
		they're a mess.
			(Adrian nods.)


Rocky waves goodbye to Adrian and exits the shop.EXT. LEHIGH ST. TRAIN TRESTLE - DAYGazzo picks up Rocky.11.INT. GAZZO'S CAR - MOVING - DAYMR. GAZZO and his YOUNG BODY GUARD sit in the front seat...
Rocky is in the back seat.ROCKYHe only had a hundred an'
		thirty. -- I think he's good
		for the rest next week, Mr.
		Gazzo.GAZZO(patiently)
		Sure, Rocky, Bob's good for
		it...

Gazzo hands Rocky a twenty.GAZZOTomorrow collect from Del
		Rio -- He's late three weeks.
		How'd you do last night?ROCKY... Fine.

Gazzo's Bodyguard looks at Rocky's bruised face in the
mirror and smiles.BODYGUARDDid ya get the license number?ROCKYOf wa?BODYGUARD... Of the truck that run over
		your face.

Gazzo steps out of the car and beckons to Rocky.GAZZOYo Rock.  Did I give you a job
		this mornin?  How come ya
		didn't break this guy's thumb
		like I asked ya?  When ya
		don't do what ya are told, it
		makes me look bad, kid.ROCKYI figure if I break the thumb
		this guy gets thrown outta his
		job and can't pay nothin no
		more.12.GAZZOIt don't matter.  It's my
		reputation.  These guys think
		they can get off light.  It's
		bad for my reputation -- It's
		bad for business.  See ya
		killer.

Gazzo gets into his car.GAZZO(to Bodyguard)
		... The Rock's a good kid.BODYGUARD(emotionless)
		... A meatbag.

They pull away.EXT. GYM - DAYGazzo drives off and Rocky strolls across the street to
Goldmill's Gym.  On the way he passes several familiar
people and exchanges waves... Out front is a young Irishman
who runs a soft pretzel stand... His name is RUDY.  It is
apparent from his face he was a prize fighter... He is blind
and mentally defective.RUDY...See the fight last night?RUDYNah, I was fightin' myself.RUDYApollo Creed beat the bum to
		pieces.EXT./INT. GYM - DAYMickey's Gym is surrounded by bars and a couple of greasy
spoons.  Out front a crowd of young Blacks talk and jive
among themselves.  Two winos lean against the entrance.

Rocky enters the gym... The place is nearly full.  The
MEASURED BEAT of SKIP ROPES and THROBBING SPEED BAGS makes
the room come alive, like it was a mindless piece of
machinery.  Over the loudspeaker MUSIC by the Isley Brothers
BLARES out... The music adds a background to the CLANG of
the AUTOMATIC TIMERS, SNORTING SPARRING PARTNERS and the
THUDDING of HEAVY BAGS.13.The room is divided -- Fifty percent Black -- thirty-five
percent Latin -- ten percent white -- five percent other.

As Rocky walks through the gym many of the FIGHTERS pause to
wave and yell greetings.FIGHTER #1Hey, hear ya knocked Spider
		Rice out in the sixth?ROCKYThe third -- Shoulda seen it.

Rocky passes another FIGHTER punching the heavy bag.FIGHTER #2(removes glove)
		Hey, Rock, touch my hand.ROCKYHow come?FIGHTER #2C'mon, it's important.

Rocky touches the Fighter's bare hand.FIGHTER #2(continuing)
		Can ya tell I just whacked-off?

Rocky smiles and moves away.INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAYThe dressing room is lined with dented lockers.  Wooden
benches stretch across the room.  On the wall is a sign that
reads, "NO KISSING."

Rocky goes to his locker.  He tries to open it but fails.
He leans his ear against the lock and rolls the tumblers.
Still it does not open.  He shakes the lock forcefully, no
luck... Rocky is flustered and sits on a bench to ponder the
situation.

After a moment of deep thought, Rocky stands, seizes the
bench and smashes open the lock.  Opening the door Rocky is
taken aback when he sees a set of very flashy clothes.ROCKY(mumbling)
		... These ain't my clothes.14.He sees a picture of several black girls taped on the inside
of the door.ROCKY(continuing)
		... These ain't my pictures.

A short powerful man of thirty-five enters.  His hair looks
like it has been shaped with hedge clippers.  His name isMIKE.ROCKYYo, Mike -- What's happenin'
		here?MIKEIt ain't your locker no more.ROCKYWhatta ya talkin' about it
		ain't my locker no more?MIKEListen, I'm with you -- But ya
		gotta talk to Mickey -- I put
		ya stuff in the bag over there.

Rocky looks at his belongings crammed in a wilted shopping
bag and follows Mike across the room... Mike leans his head
into the shower room.  Two Latin fighters are lathering up.FIGHTER...Hey, Peanut, gimme some
		soap, Man.MIKE(irate)
		Hey, Nobody -- Yeah, you,
		Nobody -- You don't call me
		Peanut.FIGHTERPeanut, gimme some soap.

The fighters laugh.  Inflamed, Mike removes a bar of soap
from his pocket and hurls it at the insulting fighter.  It
hits just above the man's head.  The fighters are shocked
into silence.

Mike turns and exits with Rocky... The fighters curse them
loudly in Spanish.15.INT. GYM - DAYRocky and Mike move past fighters going through their
training routines.ROCKYYou were ready to bite that
		guy's face.MIKEYeah -- See the fight last
		night?  Apollo Creed beat that
		English guy bad.ROCKYCreed's great.

Mike fakes a friendly punch at Rocky and hurries off to
another chore...INT. GYM - DAYThe Owner, MICKEY, sits on a stool near the entrance.  He
wears a baggy suit... He is in his late seventies.

Rocky approaches... Mickey is conversing with another fighter.MICKEYI don't care what nobody says,
		this bum Creed woulda never
		made it in the Thirties --ROCKYHey, how ya feelin', Mickey?MICKEY(monotoned)
		... What?ROCKYI said, how ya feelin'?MICKEY(dryly)
		Do you see me talkin'?  Huh?ROCKY(low)
		Yeah.16.MICKEY(spitting)
		Then stand there an' wait till
		I'm done -- Creed's good,
		yeah, he's real fine but I
		gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper,
		who's got the stuff it takes
		to be a champ -- He's mean,
		quick, an' big -- What more
		d'ya need?  Okay, go to work...
			(to Rocky)
		Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?ROCKYI was talkin' with ya man,
		Mike. -- Hey, how come I been
		put outta my locker?MICKEYDipper needed it.

Rocky turns and looks at DIPPER sparring... Dipper is a
young, muscular heavyweight with a mean expression.MICKEY(continuing)
		Dipper's a climber -- You're a
		tomato.ROCKY... Tomato?MICKEYFacts is facts.  I run a
		business here -- I'm cleanin'
		house --

Mickey pauses to watch a young middleweight time-skip as his
trainer sings "FASCINATIN' RHYTHM."MICKEY(continuing)
		How old are ya?ROCKY...What?MICKEYHow old?ROCKYCome July, twenty-five.17.MICKEYMore like thirty.ROCKYTwenty-five, thirty -- What's
		the difference? -- It took me
		two months to learn the
		combination of that locker.MICKEYThe legs must be goin'.ROCKYYeah, they're goin', -- that's
		nature... That was my locker
		for six years.MICKEY... Did ya fight last night?ROCKYYeah --MICKEYDid ya win?ROCKYYeah, Kayo.MICKEY... Who'd ya fight?ROCKYSpider Rice.MICKEYRice is a bum.ROCKYYou think everybody I fight is
		a bum.MICKEYAin't they?

Mickey shoots Rocky a quick, indifferent look and removes a
rosary from his pocket and idly rolls it around his fingers.18.MICKEY(continuing)
		Ya want the truth -- Ya got
		heart, but ya fight like an
		ape -- The only thing special
		about you is ya never got ya
		nose broke -- keep ya nose
		pretty -- what's left of ya
		brain an' retire.ROCKYListen, I'm gonna take a
		steam -- Did good last night --
		Shoulda seen it.MICKEYHey, ever think about retirin'?ROCKY...No.MICKEYThink about it.ROCKYYeah, sure.

Shrugging, Rocky moves away.ROCKY(continuing)
		...I think I'm gonna take a
		steam -- Shoulda seen me
		fight -- Did good, y'know.

Mickey leans over to Mike who approaches with a mop and pail.MICKEY(gesturing
			towards Rocky)
		Known him since he was
		fifteen -- A waste of life.

Dejected, Rocky travels to the locker room.  He passes Big
Dipper sparring in a ring... Dipper spits a mouthful of
water in a bucket and looks smugly at Rocky.DIPPER(to Rocky)
		... I dig yo' locker, Man.TRAINERTime, Dipper.19.Dipper smiles cruelly and begins sparring... Scene FADES on
Rocky's crestfallen expression.  He moves off.EXT. PET SHOP - DUSKAt sunset Rocky comes down the street and pauses at the pet
shop... He is eating Colonel Sanders' fried chicken out of a
bag... He taps on the window with a chicken bone.INT. PET SHOP - DUSKInside Adrian is arranging pet toys on the counter... She
hears the tapping, sees Rocky, and tenses.  Rocky enters.ROCKY... Wow -- cold!  Good night
		to catch pneumonia.

Adrian smiles slightly and moves behind the counter.  Rocky
fumbles idly among the pet toys.ROCKY(continuing)
		Ah -- I came in here for
		somethin'... Oh, yeah, would
		ya like somebody to walk ya
		home?

The girl wants to say yes but a tremendous inferiority
complex will not permit it... Rocky understands.ROCKY(continuing)
		Hey, how's my buddy doin'?
			(looks into
			Butkus' cage)
		-- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see
		ya later.ADRIAN... Goodnight, Rocky.

Rocky exits.  Adrian watches his departure with mixed
emotions.EXT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHTA short while later Rocky arrives at Andy's Bar... He throws
the Colonel Sanders bag and bones in a large public litter
can.  The trash can has a bicentennial picture of George
Washington pointing at a pile of garbage.  The caption
reads, "There was no litter at Valley Forge!"20.INT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHTRocky enters the bar.  He sits the Drunk in a booth...
Several drinkers wave at him.  OLD ANDY sets a mug of beer
in front of him... Rocky seems to be looking for someone.ROCKYCatch pneumonia out there --
		Seen Paulie?

Andy casually nods towards the men's room.

Rocky traverses the room and passes TWO DRUNKS leaning on
the bar.INT. ANDY'S RESTROOM - NIGHTRocky enters the restroom... It is a vile stench hole with
years of the remnants of many sick drunks caked on the wall.

PAULIE is presently trying to comb his hair in the only
remaining piece of mirror in the room... Paulie is in his
early thirties.  He is medium height.  Brown hair.  Square
shouldered.  He has a foul personality... A classic
misanthrope.ROCKYYo, Paulie.PAULIE(very drunk)
		Yo, Rocky -- Look at this
		mirror.  I'd like to kill the
		friggin' moron who broke this
		mirror.ROCKYYo, Paulie.PAULIEWhat?ROCKYYour sister's givin' me the

		head with a razor.ROCKYDon't get mental, man.PAULIEYa caught me in a bad mood.ROCKYYa always in a bad mood --PAULIE... Adrian ain't sharp.

The restroom stench is overwhelming... Rocky covers his nose
with the neckline of his t-shirt.PAULIE(continuing)
		She's a loser -- She don't
		enjoy life -- She reads --
		Brainy -- Pushin' thirty
		friggin' years old!  She's
		gonna die alone if she don't

stumbling, Paulie talks as he walks.PAULIEThe girl's dryin' up!  She's

		Rock -- How 'bout yo' talk to
		her?  Y'know, it's Thanksgivin'
		tomorrow.ROCKY... Sure.PAULIETomorrow you come for some
		bird, right?ROCKYAbsolutely...

Paulie smiles and Rocky guides him to a booth... Rocky steps
to the bar.  Andy leans over to him.ANDYThat was alotta crap to go
		through for a dinner invite.

Rocky shakes his head no and raises his eyes towards a
suspended television... the nightly sports broadcast is on.
The SPORTS COMMENTATOR is at the airport and about to
interview the heavyweight champion of the world, APOLLO
CREED.  Creed is twenty-eight years old.  He is a tall,
smooth-muscled Black with barely a scar on his light coffee-
colored face...23.He is followed by an entourage of mixed trainers and
cornermen.  Also tagging alone is a small group of hangers-on.

The Commentator interviews Creed as he and his followers
disembark a private jet.COMMENTATORHow was the flight, Champ?APOLLOVery high an' very fast.

Apollo's crowd smiles almost automatically at everything he

slumped unconscious in the booth.

hangs the sign "ATOMIC HOAGIE SHOP, INC." Out front are
several YOUNG MEN and WOMEN.  They are much too young to be

Rocky ignores the statement and faces a very young girl who
is smoking and leaning whore-like against the wall.ROCKYIs that Marie? -- Marie, ya

		out so late?

The girl, MARIE, assumes an indifferent attitude, attempting
to impress her friends.MARIE... Screw you.ROCKY(awed)
		What'd you say?MARIE... Screw you, yoyo.

The gang laughs.  Angered and shocked, Rocky grabs her arm.ROCKYDid these guys teach you to

Rocky and Marie exit the dark school yard... Standing in the
shadows of the building are three young muggers.  The light
from their cigarettes flares red in their faces.

The muggers pace Rocky across the street and follow them
down the block... Rocky sees them and stops and faces the
three.  The muggers pause and study Rocky from a distance of
twenty yards.  Rocky gives a loud boxer's snort, wipes his
nose with the side of his thumb and rolls his shoulders...
The muggers are intimidated and slowly peel off the meander
away.

Rocky turns to Marie who has been standing behind him.ROCKY(points down

Marie nods.ROCKY(continuing)

They exchange smiles and Marie moves away.  Rocky has made
an impact on her life.MARIEGoodnight, Rocky.ROCKY'Night, Marie.

Rocky flings open the window and bellows like a foghorn.ROCKY(continuing)
		!!Yo, Paulie -- Ya sister's
		with me!  I'll call ya later.

Rocky closes the window and faces the woman... She is not
smiling.  She looks frightened.50.ROCKY(continuing)
		What's the matter?  Ya don't
		like the room?ADRIANIt's fine.ROCKYIt's only temporary.ADRIANIt's not that --ROCKYWhat's the problem?  You don't

Adrian moves to the door... Rocky intercepts her.ROCKY(continuing; softly)
		Would ya take off your glasses?ADRIAN(dumbstruck)
		What?ROCKYThe glasses... Please.

Rocky removes her glasses and looks deeply into her eyes.ADRIAN(timidly)
		... T-thank you.ROCKYDo me another favor?ADRIAN... What?ROCKYCould ya take off that hat.

After a moment, Adrian removes the hat... She is becoming
rather pretty.ROCKY(continuing)
		I always knew you was pretty.ADRIANDon't tease me.

The woman melts into the corner and begins lightly sobbing...
Rocky steps forward and fences her with his arms and body.ROCKYI wanna kiss ya -- Ya don't
		have to kiss me back if ya
		don't feel like it.

Rocky softly kisses the woman... Her arms hang limp.  He
puts more passion into the kiss and she starts to respond.
Her hand glides like smoke up his back.52.She embraces his neck.  The dam of passion erupts.  She
gives herself freely for the first time in thirty years.EXT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - DAYThe following day, Rocky strolls down the street to
Goldmill's Gym... Out front a group of young blacks stop
talking and study Rocky as he passes.  Rocky's eyebrows knit
in confusion.INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - DAYRocky climbs the stairs and enters the gym...

... In a matter of seconds, his presence is known and the
athletes stare in wonderment... The big black heavyweight
contender, Dipper, throws down his towel in disgust and
turns away.

Mike quietly approaches Rocky.MIKEHey, Rock -- What happened?ROCKY'Bout what?

Mickey Goldmill steps out of his office...MICKEYDid ya get the message, kid?ROCKYMessage -- What message?

Mickey pulls out a card from his breast pocket... He hands
it to Rocky.MICKEYA Rep from Miles Jergens'

fumbles with his rosary beads.MICKEY(continuing)

The Secretary rises and enters Jergens' office... Rocky eyes
the multitude of sporting pictures hanging on all four walls.

The Secretary returns.SECRETARYYou may go in.

Rocky collects himself and enters...54.INT. JERGENS' OFFICE - DAYMiles Jergens warmly greets him.JERGENSHello, Mr. Balboa -- I'm Miles

The weight of the statement comes crashing down in Rocky.
For a long moment he becomes nothing more than a basket case
as he ponders the statement... He half regains his senses.ROCKY... Ah... Absolutely.

top floor landing.ROCKYY'know how I said that stuff

Gazzo takes out a wad and peels off several bills.GAZZOHere's five hundred -- Put it

Gazzo looks at the Bodyguard and shakes his head as if to
imply, "Why's this guy asking such a foolish question?"

Rocky walks away.63.INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHTRocky returns home and enters his apartment.  After turning
on the light, he flips on his RECORD PLAYER.  He now feeds
the turtles.ROCKYLook who's home!

Rocky notices two telegrams laying inside the threshold.  He
approaches them with a sense of awe.  He opens and reads one.
Settling on the bed, he reads the other.

A KNOCK is HEARD.  Rocky opens the door.  Mickey Goldmill,
the gym owner, stands framed in the doorway.MICKEY(stiffly)
		I seen the light.  I figure
		somebody was home.ROCKYHey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin'

Rocky tosses soiled clothing off a mangled armchair.ROCKY(continuing)

		Mick, this is too much.MICKEYHow do you mean?ROCKYI'm usta seein' ya at the gym,
		but seein' ya here, in my
		house, it's kinda outta joint.

By the manner in which Goldmill listens, it is obvious
something important is preying on his mind.

Rocky is slightly uncomfortable, almost embarrassed at
having outsiders see how he lives.MICKEYListen, Rock, you're a very
		lucky guy.ROCKYYeah.64.MICKEYWhat's happened is freak luck.ROCKYFreak luck for sure.MICKEYLook at all them other fighters.
		Real good boys.  Good records.

		Freak luck is a strange thing.

Mickey does not hear.  His attention is drawn to the turtles.MICKEYWhatta' those?ROCKYTurtles -- domestic turtles.MICKEY(businesslike)
		I'm here tellin' ya to be very
		smart with this shot.  Like

Mickey looks hard into Rocky's eyes.MICKEY(continuing)
		Ya need a manager.  An advisor.

He lights a half-smoked cigar.ROCKY(at a loss)
		Fifty years, huh.65.MICKEY(stronger)
		Fifty years.  The rep is known
		around Philly, an' a good rep
		can't be bought, but I don't

Mickey deafly continues, becoming more engrossed every second.MICKEYLook at this face -- twenty-
		one stitches over the left
		eye, thirty-four over the
		right -- my nose was busted
		seventeen times, the last

Rocky points to his most prized possession.ROCKYNobody ever said that --
		There's his picture.MICKEYYeah, ya kinda remind me of

Mickey has rung the bell.  Nothing could please Rocky more
than being compared to his idol.ROCKYReally think so?MICKEYYa got heart.ROCKYHeart, but I ain't got no
		Tocker.

Rocky shifts against the wall and lowers himself into a
crouch.MICKEYChrist, I know this business.
		Rocky, when I was fightin' it
		was the dirtiest racket goin',

		that's me in my prime.  I had

Rocky rises and opens a window.MICKEY(continuing)
		Respect, I always dished ya
		respect.ROCKY... Ya gave Dipper my locker.MICKEY(almost begging)
		I'm sorry, I -- I made a
		mistake.  Kid, I'm askin' man

		Whatever I got, I always got

		about ten years ago when I was
		startin', but ya never helped

Mickey drops the ashtray and kneels to pick it up... He
remains on one knee.MICKEYIf ya was wantin' my help, why
		didn't ya ask?  Just ask.ROCKYI asked, but ya never helped
		nothin'! -- Like the Bible

		chance.MICKEY(yells)
		Rocky, I'm seventy-six years
		old.  Maybe you can be the
		winner I never was -- your
		shot is my last shot!

Rocky is choked and goes into the bathroom and closes the
door.

Mickey struggles to his feet and, like a beaten man, leaves.

Several moments later Rocky steps out and lowers himself
into bed.  Springing up a second later, he runs outside.69.EXT. STREET OF ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHTRocky races up the block toward the shadowy and hunched form
of Mickey.  Way in the distance, we SEE Rocky stop the old
man beneath a street lamp.  He places an arm around his
shoulder.INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - PRE-DAWNThe following morning, Rocky's ALARM CLOCK GOES OFF at
exactly four A.M.  Not accustomed to rising this early, with
great difficulty Rocky staggers to his feet and wavers to
the bathroom.  He turns the light on and roaches scatter.

At the top of the mirror hang the telegrams.  Rocky fills
the basin and submerges his face in cold water.

Rocky sways to the icebox and removes a dozen eggs.  He
cracks five raw eggs into a glass and downs it in one
swill... his body quivers.EXT. STREET OF ROCKY'S APARTMENT - PRE-DAWNRocky steps outside.  He is dressed in a well-worn sweat
suit with a hood, gloves and sneakers.  It is pitch dark and
his steaming breath attests to the cold.

He begins running down the center of the deserted street.
He can only be clearly SEEN as his form passes beneath the
street lamps.

Two garbage men stop hoisting cans to watch him pass.EXT. ART MUSEUM STAIRS - DAWNRocky stands at the base of an overwhelmingly steep flight
of stairs.  He stares up at the stairs that nearly disappear
into the morning gray.  Taking a deep breath, he starts up.
From the start, he looks out of shape and halfway up his
legs give way.  Standing, he brushes off and descends the
stairs.EXT. CITY HALL - DAWNRocky passes City Hall and veers to the river.  He pauses,
heaving great gusts of exhausted breaths.  He throws several
lazy jabs in the air and walks awhile with hands on his
aching sides.  Men delivering the morning papers observe
with amusement.

Rocky forces himself to begin running again.70.EXT. ELEVATED TRAIN STATION - DAWNHeading along Spring Garden Street, Rocky passes beneath an
elevated train station.  The ROARING TRAIN overhead seems to
blend perfectly with his muscular running style.EXT. DOCKS - DAWNThe sky is beginning to lighten.  The fighter now runs along
the piers and past anchored freighters.EXT. EASTERN PACKING COMPANY - DAWNIt is five-thirty and Rocky approaches the loading platform
belonging to Eastern Packing Company.  Alongside the loading
platform come several boxcars.

Rocky mounts the ramp and knocks on the metal door.  It soon
opens and Paulie guides him inside.  Paulie is drunk.INT. SHIPPING OFFICE - DAYPAULIEHow ya feelin'?ROCKY(panting)
		... Tight.PAULIEI got whiskey here.ROCKY... No.

Rocky notices TWO PUERTO RICANS lounging alongside theshipping office.PAULIEThis is the guy who's fightin'

		Hooray, man.PAULIERock'll be comin' by every
		mornin' to pick up some
		Prime -- can't train on that
		store crap.

Rocky smiles and Paulie leads him out of the office and to
the large metal door of a walk-in refrigerator.INT. FREEZER - DAYThey enter.  The freezer resembles a modern torture chamber...
row after row of hanging slabs of beef stretch into the
darkness to the far end of the refrigerator.  The blower
overhead causes the men to speak loudly.PAULIE(teasing)
		If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end
		up hangin' on the hook, right?ROCKYGazzo's a good man.PAULIEHow 'bout you talk to 'em
		about me?
			(tightly)
		Please do me that favor.ROCKYKeep this job, ya eat better.

Paulie opens a jackknife and idly jabs the hanging meat.  He
swills whiskey from a pint bottle.PAULIEY'know, d'ya think you an' my
		sister -- Ah, doin' good
		together?ROCKYWhatta you think?PAULIEAin't sure, what's the story?ROCKYWhat?72.PAULIEThe story -- what's happenin'?

Paulie speaks like a man who has been mulling this over for
quite a while.PAULIE(continuing)
		Ya really like her?ROCKYSure I like her.PAULIE(nervous laughter)
		What's the attraction?  I
		don't see it?ROCKYI dunno -- she fills gaps.PAULIEWhat gaps?ROCKY(shrugs and
			takes meat)
		She got gaps.  I got gaps --
		together we fill the gaps.PAULIE(sharply)
		You ballin' her?ROCKY(turns around)
		Don't talk dirty 'bout ya
		sister.PAULIE(tersely)
		C'mon, ya screwin' her?

From across the room Rocky looks him hard in the eyes.ROCKYThat's why I can't put ya
		together with Gazzo, cause ya
		talk too much -- big mouth.

Paulie reddens.  He steps forward and slams his fists in a
hanging beef.73.The punching of the beef is a muted challenge and Rocky
responds.

Rocky walks up to a beef and slams his fist into the ribs.

The grotesque object swings in a wide arc like a hanging
corpse.  Rocky moves to the next one and hooks.

Rocky's face reveals a never before seen concentration, as
though he were locked in total battle.PAULIEHit the rump.  The rump!
		Ya'll break the ribs!

Rocky speeds up and continues pounding on the second row of
beef.  Paulie's eyes widen and his face grimaces with every
punch, like he were receiving it.  Rocky moves into the dark
recess of the refrigerator.  Only the dull SOUNDS of his
POUNDING FISTS can be HEARD.

Rocky works his way to Paulie again.  Every hanging beef
swings and appears surrealistically alive.PAULIE(continuing)
		We do that to Creed an'
		they'll take us to jail for
		murder.

Rocky looks at his hands.  They are drenched in red up to
the elbows with beef blood.

Paulie hands him a package of beef.ROCKYDon't talk dirty 'bout ya
		sister.

Rocky takes the package and runs out.  Paulie's bleary eyes
reveal a fearful respect and slight resentment.INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - DAYThe gym is filled to capacity.  The NOISE is DEAFENING.
Rocky pounds a heavy bag.

Mickey steps forward and removes a piece of string from his
pocket.74.MICKEY(passionate)
		Stop!  Stop!  I can't stand it!
		It's clumsy.  You're off
		balance.

He motions to his bullish helper, Mike.  He hands him the
string.MICKEY(continuing)
		Tie it to both ankles -- Leave
		two feet slack.ROCKYI never had good footwork.

Mike completes the task.MICKEYForget the footwork -- You're
		off balance.  The legs are

Everyone laughs... Dipper moves across the room like a large
snake.  He brushes people aside and steps behind Rocky.  He
nudges him... Rocky thinks it is an accident and ignores it.

Dipper pushes harder and Rocky looks questioningly at him.DIPPER(loud)
		Ya nothin', Boy!

Apollo stops his sales pitch in mid-sentence... The
television crew faces Dipper.DIPPER(continuing)

across the side of the head... The gym becomes stone cold.
Dipper is in total command and enjoying every moment of it.80.DIPPERIf yo're afraid to fight me,

Mickey looks nervously around and knows it's only seconds
before the blood will run... Rocky stands motionless.MICKEY(softly)
		Let's take a walk, Rock.
		Please, don't take a chance.
		He wants to hurt you so you
		can't fight.

Rocky swallows his pride.  He still has the string around
his ankles.  He starts to shuffle away with Mickey... Dipper
steps forward and viciously slaps Rocky again.

Mike jumps forward.MIKEWhy you tryin' to cut 'im, man!
		Back off, scumbag, or I'll
		bite your face!

Dipper cuts loose with a hook and knocks Mike flat.  The
room reeks of fear... Apollo's eyes flick back and forth
between Rocky and Dipper.  Apollo taps his bodyguards and
they begin to ease away.DIPPER... Now, boy, kiss my feet.

Rocky eyes his friend lying on the floor.  He shuffles
forward and stands before Dipper.DIPPER(continuing;
			almost in a whisper)
		... Kiss 'em.

Rocky looks at Mickey, then lowers his eyes to Dipper's
feet... Dipper smiles.  Rocky starts to bend towards the
shoes.  Without warning, he explodes with a pair of
combinations into Dipper's exposed ribs.  A CRACK is HEARD
and Dipper sinks to the floor writhing in pain... The room
is silent except for Dipper's moaning.

Apollo is stunned by the scene.  The gym has become a very
gloomy place.  He eyes Rocky with admiration and a hint of
apprehension... He leaves.81.Mickey is the first one to shake off the chill... He shakes
his fists at the Reporters, and puts his arm around Rocky.MICKEYThe kid's got cannons -- Print

The crowd disperses, leaving Dipper a pathetic and broken
figure lying on a dirty gym floor.INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHTThey enter the dismal apartment... On the floor are at least
ten telegrams.  Rocky scoops them up and tosses them aside.
Next to the door is a pile of over a hundred telegrams.ADRIANDon't you open them anymore?ROCKYThey either say, 'Kill the

lovely curtains from a shopping bag... The colorful curtains
glare in the dark room.ADRIANLike?ROCKYSharp -- Real nice.ADRIANReally -- You don't think

He takes a bottle of wine out of the icebox.  As he swills
the wine he hears the SOUND of Rocky's and Adrian's VOICES
traveling from his sister's room.  Paulie's face tightens
and he staggers towards the bedroom.

He stands outside the bedroom door and peers through a
crack... Rocky, Adrian, and the dog are watching TV in the

Paulie kicks the door out of frustration and appears to be
bordering on a nervous breakdown.PAULIE(continuing)

Paulie goes to the living room closet and removes a baseball
bat... Rocky and Adrian quickly follow.PAULIEI don't want ya messin' up my

windows... Rocky is slumped in a chair and it is apparent he
has lost interest in watching the movies.

The film has completed its run through the projector and
lazily flops around on the top reel... Listlessly Rocky rubs
his reddened eyes.97.The door opens and Mickey flips on the light... The two men
stare at each other for a long moment.  Mickey studies
Rocky's despondent expression and knows what is on the
fighter's mind.MICKEY... I know what you're
		thinkin'm kid -- At least ya
		gotta shot -- All ya can do is
		try ya' best.

Rocky stands and, with his dog, inches past Mickey and exits
the room.  Mickey walks over and turns off the projector.
He idly pushes the machine with a lazy motion until it
slides off the desk and crashes to the floor.EXT. STREET - DAWNAfter leaving Mickey's gym, Rocky and his dog listlessly
move down the street and head for home.INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - DAYRocky arrives at his apartment... Adrian is asleep on the

Adrian touches Rocky's face... The fighter gently lowers
himself beside his woman.ROCKY(continuing)

the Philadelphia Spectrum.

The Spectrum is filling to capacity... Grandly dressed
celebrities and wealthy fight fans lower themselves into
their ringside seat.  Nearly everyone is holding a red,
white, and blue sweater...

blue.  High above the ring are huge posters of GEORGEWASHINGTON - ABE LINCOLN - DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. - BENFRANKLIN - and APOLLO CREED.INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHTApollo Creed sits in his dressing room... It is dead silent

Alone, Rocky is on his knee praying.  Completing his silent
prayer, he stands and looks at himself in the mirror.
Suddenly a wave of emotion sweeps over him as he thinks that
in a few moments he will face the most overwhelming challenge
of his life.

Out in the dressing room, the door opens and a guard leans
in and nods that it is time.  He leaves... Rocky steps out.MICKEY... It's time, kid.

Rocky nods and moves toward Adrian.ADRIAN... I'll wait for you here.

Rocky nods and she kisses him.  The fighter leaves with his
trainers... Adrian is on the verge of tears.INT. HALLWAY - NIGHTRocky, Mickey and Mike start down the long hallway... Up

		fifty million fans in theatres
		in nearly every corner of the
		world.  I would like to
		welcome an old friend, and co-
		commentator for this evening's
		event -- Jimmy Michaels.COMMENTATOR #2Thank you, Bob.  The
		electricity is everywhere
		tonight.  Rocky Balboa, a
		fifty-to-one underdog, is
		living a Cinderella story
		which has captured peoples'
		imaginations all over the
		world -- to quote a popular
		sports magazine, 'The fighting
		style should be 'The Caveman
		Against the Cavalier.' From
		the increase in sound it
		appears the challenger is now
		approaching the ring... His
		record is forty-four wins,
		twenty losses and thirty-eight
		knockouts.COMMENTATOR #1I only wonder if this man has
		the skill to go past three
		rounds -- Vegas odds say, 'no.'102.ANOTHER ANGLEA wedge of uniformed guards knife down the aisle to the ring.
Many people wish Rocky well as he passes... people also hurl
insults.  From the expression on Mickey's face it is also
the greatest night of his life.  In the audience are familiar
faces from the gym.  From the back of the arena a ROAR goes
up... Apollo Creed is in a mock boat dressed like George
Washington.  He throws silver dollars.  The NOISE builds to
DEAFENING proportions.  Creed's trainer holds the rope and
Creed bounds into the ring.  He tears off the Washington
outfit and it is clearly SEEN that Apollo Creed is garbed in
an outrageous Uncle Sam outfit... On his head is a red,
white and blue sequined top hat.  The robe is sequined red,
white and blue.  His boxing trunks are red, white and blue
silk with stars around the waistband.  The boxing shoes
match the trunks.  On his chin is a pointed white Uncle Sam
beard.COMMENTATOR #2You could go deaf with the
		noise -- it undoubtedly means
		Champion Apollo Creed is
		heading towards the ring --COMMENTATOR #1Am I seeing right?  Creed is
		approaching the ring in a boat.
		Is he supposed to be George
		Washington?  Obviously so.COMMENTATOR #2It's been confirmed that it is
		definitely an impersonation of
		George Washington -- a great
		way to start 1976 off.COMMENTATOR #1I agree.

Immediately Creed begins gracefully dancing in a wide circle.
He passes within inches of Rocky in his Uncle Sam outfit.APOLLOI want you!  I want you!

The crowd loves the taunting.  Apollo Creed floats back to
his corner.MICKEYDon't let 'im get you tight.103.ROCKYWhatta ya think that outfit
		cost?ANOTHER ANGLEThe ANNOUNCER steps to the center of the ring... Several men
in suits stand against the ropes... Paulie is dressed nicely
and sits at ringside with a pretty blonde escort.  Rocky

his date... Rocky smiles and gestures back.ANNOUNCERLadies and gentlemen --

FRAZIER rumbles to the center of the ring.  The CROWD CHEERS.
Apollo puts on a show... He grimaces and gestures like he's
going to attack Frazier.  His cornermen hold him back.  They
laugh.  Frazier goes to Rocky's corner.FRAZIERSave some of him for me.ANOTHER ANGLEThe Commentators beckon to Frazier as he exits the ring.COMMENTATOR #1The former champ looks great --

The arena EXPLODES and Creed puts on a display of hand speed.ANOTHER ANGLEThe REFEREE motions to both fighters... They step to the
center of the ring.  As the Referee explains the rules
Apollo and Rocky stare hard into each other's eyes... The
Referee's voice fades and the fighters' expressions fill the
screen... Something soulful and frightening is being
communicated.REFEREE... Now come out fighting.

The fighters return to their corners.MICKEYGod bless ya, Rock.ROCKYThanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try.ANOTHER ANGLEThe BELL RINGS... Creed dances forward and boxes Rocky as
though he considers the man an amateur.106.ANOTHER ANGLECOMMENTATOR #1The Champ stings the slower

disbelief.  So do Rocky's.

		got the power!  The body, get
		the body!!!  Ya got him goin'!REFEREESix!... Seven!... Eight!...

Creed is up... His playful attitude is gone... he is now all
business.  His lightning jab stings Rocky's face repeatedly.APOLLO... Come at me, sucker!

Rocky charges and a terrific right crashes against Apollo's
chin, followed by an uppercut to the liver that causes Creed
to cringe...107.Apollo counters with jabs and Rocky whips brutal combinations
to the body.

and furious.  Apollo melts out a left hook that raises a
goose egg over Rocky's eye... Apollo employs footwork that
dazzles Rocky.  He has class.  He studies Rocky and employs
his lightning jab with cutting accuracy. Still Rocky shuffles
ahead, bombarding Creed's midsection with hooks.108.ANOTHER ANGLEThe round ends with Apollo assaulting Rocky with blinding
combinations and delivering a stupendous right cross that
flings Rocky into the ropes and shatters his nose... The
round ends.ANOTHER ANGLEApollo stands in his corner and jokes with the fans, but he
is beginning to show the strain from the body punches.APOLLOMan, I rearranged his face

steps Rocky's sledgehammer hooks.  An expert ring general,
Apollo uses the ring fully.  Rocky keeps tearing in and
Creed meets the bombing attack that cause thick swelling...
Near the end of the round Rocky fires a penetrating punch to
the heart.COMMENTATOR #1Apollo almost sprints out of
		his corner -- feints and
		throws a pair of left-right
		combinations.  Balboa drops
		beneath a left upper cut and
		lands a very solid shot on
		Creed's temple -- not much
		movement from Balboa, duck a
		left, a right, another left
		and explodes with a right hook
		to the temple -- I mean
		explodes.  The Champ backs off.COMMENTATOR #2There's no way Apollo expected
		this kind of hitting power.COMMENTATOR #1No way -- but the brilliant
		ability of the Champion to

		Rocky.(MORE)110.COMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D)Creed on the offensive --
		Balboa takes the punishment

The wallop knocks Apollo off balance... The CAMERA GOES TO A
STEEP ANGLE SHOT from the floor, VERTICALLY UP Apollo's body.
The SCENE GOES INTO SLOW MOTION... Rocky releases a
terrifying uppercut that opens a gash under Creed's eye.

GROWING ROAR OF THE FANS... She exits the dressing room.INT. ARENA HALL - NIGHTStepping out of the dressing room she walks down the corridor.
The MOUNTING CHEERS make her speed up.  She opens the door
at the end of the corridor and is hit by a THUNDEROUS WAVE
OF SOUND.  The guard at the door inspects her and goes back
to watching the fight.112.INT. ARENA - NIGHTAdrian stands at the rear of the arena and watches the
battle.  She is entranced by the power of it all.

Back in the ring, Rocky keeps grinding ahead.  He plants a
thumping left over the Champion's heart and Creed winces...
Rocky is game but losing.

At ringside Paulie is frantic... He is living the fight from
his seat.

Mr. Gazzo and his Bodyguard watch from the second row.
Gazzo looks proud.  The Bodyguard, impassive.INT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHTA huge and lively crowd look up at the television over the
bar... They see Rocky driving Creed against the ropes and
cheer loudly.ANDY... The Rock's got real stones.INT. ARENA - NIGHTThe men are fighting with appalling tenacity.  Rocky rips
and tears into the body... Apollo counters with a ceaseless
stream of rapier-like lefts... The Challenger is seriously
outclassed.APOLLOC'mon -- Lemme cut yo'!

Rocky wades in and Creed employs incredible footwork.  He
sets himself and cuts loose with a thunderbolt right cross
to Rocky's already broken nose.  Blood sprays from the wound
and red droplets drip from his chin...

Rocky takes a merciless beating and is staggered by a
torrent of combinations.  Rocky's eyes are closed.  But
Creed cannot drop him... The BELL RINGS.ANOTHER ANGLEThe Commentators shift in their seats.COMMENTATOR #1Without a doubt this is the
		most punishing brawl I have

		my eyes!

Mickey nods to Benny.  He secretly places a small ring knife
between his index and middle finger.  In one smooth movement
he drags the razor over the blood welts and quickly covers
the draining wounds with gauze... It is done so quickly no
one is ever aware of the operation.ANOTHER ANGLEAt the rear of the arena Adrian looks transfixed at the ring.
She is caught up in the heat of the battle.ANOTHER ANGLEThe BELL RINGS for round fourteen.  Rocky bores in close,
but Apollo still has spring in his legs.  He seems determined
to end it this round... Apollo catches Rocky flush on the
jaw.  Rocky is staggered.  Like a wolf, Apollo cuts loose
with pure savagery.  Rocky is driven against the ropes and
receives a devastating beating from the Champion... Rocky is
dropped.

Rocky sits stunned in the middle of the ring... Everything
is a distortion.  He looks for familiar faces as though to
ask for help... Mickey and Mike scream frantically for him
to stay down.REFEREESix -- Seven -- Eight --

Rocky gets to his feet and tenses with renewed energy.  He
is like a wounded wild animal.  The tide suddenly turns.
Rocky drops low and catches Apollo with a pair of terrific
body punches that seem to drive Apollo's diaphragm up to his
throat... A CRACK is HEARD.  A glaze of pain covers Apollo's
eyes.  It is only a supreme effort that keeps the Champion
upright... Apollo is badly hurt.  He is bent over.

Rocky moves towards Apollo.  Apollo flicks dread jabs into
Rocky's eyes... The Italian wades in with punches that seem
to bulge out Apollo's back.  Creed takes the punishment like
a stoic.

Blood is running from Apollo's mouth.  In the clinch he
leans over Rocky and it drips down the Italian's neck and
shoulders.  Apollo shields his wound from the ringside
judges and continues to fight.115.ANOTHER ANGLEThe BELL RINGS.  Apollo's men rush out and guide him to his
corner.APOLLO... Ribs broke --

		Great, kid, great.

The ring Doctor leans over Rocky and checks the eyes.DOCTOROne more round -- How do you

Rocky is approaching the supreme moment of his life.  He
cannot be bothered with pain or doctors.116.ROCKYFine -- Go away, I'm gonna

Everyone is distraught over Rocky's dangerous condition.MICKEYWe gotta stop it, kid.MIKEYa gave it ya best shot!MICKEYNobody's gonna say ya didn't

		never seen anything like it in

a lethal blow to the side of the head that jolts Rocky's
mouthpiece into the second row... Rocky sags against the
ropes in a crucified position... The insane crowd leaps to
their feet.ANOTHER ANGLERocky's bloody teeth snarl at Apollo and he waves him to
come ahead and fight toe to toe... Apollo obliges with a
weary but effective burst of rights and lefts that have K.O.
written on every punch.  Rocky counters the assault blow for
blow.ROCKYGimme ya best!!!!

Mickey looks at the clock... TEN SECONDS TO GO.ROCKY(continuing)
		Gimme ya best!!!

Blood sprays over the ropes and onto the ringside
photographers... They are horrified and wipe away the blood.

The fighters stand toe to toe and drag every remaining bit
of strength from their souls and beat each other without
mercy.  They look hypnotized and have entered a dimension
far beyond blood and pain.SIXFIVEFOURTHREETWOONE!ANOTHER ANGLEThe BELL RINGS... The arena EXPLODES with thunderous approval.118.Their cornermen rush to their collapsed fighters... In the
midst of all the confusion both fighters look at each other
with unabashed respect -- They stand like blood-drenched
gladiators on the most dramatic night of their lives.

As though reacting to some unspoken command, they both step
towards each other and embrace... Apollo whispers in Rocky's
ear.APOLLO... Ain't gonna be no rematch.ROCKY... Don't want one.

Mickey comes over and separates them and leads him back to

Mickey and Rocky look at each other and grin.  Mickey hugs
Rocky like a son.  Mickey raises Rocky's hand again.  Rocky
turns away from Mickey and pats Benny the cut-man's
shoulder... Benny smiles wearily.  Rocky stares across the
ring at Apollo Creed, who stands victorious, but his face
and body are badly distorted... The two men lock stares that
reflect admiration.ANOTHER ANGLEApollo climbs out of the ring and the fans crush forward
screaming his name and waving red, white and blue banners.ANOTHER ANGLERocky also climbs out of the ring and waves of frantic well-
wishing fans rumble forward... Mickey's eyes show mounting

they are soon engulfed by screaming waves of humanity.
Apollo is suddenly hoisted into the air and is being carried
along by a legion of fans.120.ANOTHER ANGLEOn the opposite aisle Rocky is experiencing the same
overwhelming adulation by his fans but does not seem to be
frightened by it, like Apollo.  Mickey tries his best to
control things but his voice is drowned out in the growing
clamor.  The fans shove the guards aside and hoist Rocky to
their shoulders.ANOTHER ANGLERocky's and Apollo's fans are aggressively competing against

The CHANTING IS DEAFENING.ANOTHER ANGLEFearful that Rocky is in danger, Adrian tries to move
forward.  Running headlong into the crowd, she angles
through the mass to get to Rocky.ANOTHER ANGLEShe is manhandled and shoved in a multitude of directions,
but she keeps her feet... She sees him.  In the distance,
Rocky floats INTO VIEW and Adrian flattens against the wall
and waits for the procession to pass.

The procession approaches and she clearly sees Rocky's
unbelievably battered but smiling face.  He appears to be
king of the world.

The procession approaches and passes Adrian.  She jumps on
her toes and waves frantically but is not seen.  She screams
Rocky's name... Somehow the delicate voice knifes through
the racket and reaches Rocky.

Rocky frantically looks in all directions and barely manages
to see Adrian jumping up and down waving.  The crowd is
carrying him away.  He attempts to lower himself but the
crowd won't permit it.121.Rocky instead turns and begins climbing across people's
heads and shoulders.  He resembles a man trying to go up a
down escalator.  People are jammed so tightly together Rocky
manages to crawl across them to Adrian.

Still suspended in air, Rocky leans down and Adrian jumps up
and they lock in an embrace.ADRIANI love you -- I love you -- I
		love you...

The two are swept along into the greatest night anyone can
remember...THE END
