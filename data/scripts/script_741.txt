MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERYScreenplay by

                          Woody Allen & Marshall BrickmanNOTEMost of the sequences in this production are filmed using a hand-
          held camera or a Steadycam. These very mobile cameras move around
          the set, and get constantly closer and further from the
          characters. Still, we'll be using the usual technical terms, such
          as �long shot� or �full shot� or �medium shot� here and there to
          give the reader an idea of the location of the camera at the
          beginning of each sequence. And then we'll mention the movements
          of the camera.TRISTAR LOGOWinged white horse flying over cloudsBLACK SCREENCREDITS IN WHITE LETTERS ON BLACK SCREENWe hear jazz music during the credits.END OF CREDITSNEW-YORK - AERIAL VIEW - EXTERIOR NIGHTWhile the camera is flying over New-York, we keep on hearing the
          jazz music.
                         
          The camera reaches a round building that looks like a stadium and
          starts moving around the building.HOCKEY GAME - INTERIOR NIGHTLong shot on the skating rink. A hockey game is in progress on the
          rink. The camera follows a player, and then pans on the audience.
                         
          The camera stops on a medium shot of Larry and Carol, a couple in
          their early fifties. Larry seems fascinated by the game, but Carol
          seems to find it boring. She looks at the ceiling, and then puts
          her hand over her mouth to suppress a yawn. Larry turns toward
          her.LARRYCome on.CAROLWhat?LARRYYou promised to sit through the entire hockey game without
           being bored and I'll sit through the Wagner opera with you
           next week.CAROLI know, honey, I promised. I know.LARRYI already bought the earplugs.CAROLYeah. Well, with your eyesight, I'm surprised you can see
           the puck.
                         
          The crowd starts yelling and we guess that one of the players has
          done something really good. Carol mockingly claps her hands.CAROLYay, hooray.
                         
          Then she raises her eyes to the ceiling, seeming more bored than
          ever.LARRY'S BUILDING - LOBBY - INTERIOR NIGHTA nice-looking apartment building in New-York.
                         
          Full shot of the lobby. We see the street through the glass door.
          An uniformed attendant is standing near a counter, on which he is
          writing on a book.
                         
          Larry and Carol are coming from the street and entering the
          building. He is carrying some shopping bags, and she is reading a
          newspaper, the �Daily News�.LARRYGod. I can't wait to get into bed and stretch out.CAROLYeah.
                         
          The attendant slightly turns around and bows to them. They bow
          back to him. He goes back to his book-keeping, and the couple
          keeps on walking through the lobby.LARRYYou know, there's a Bob Hope movie on television later.CAROLknow. Can you believe this guy in Indiana ? Killed twelve
           victims, dismembered them and ate them.LARRYReally ? Well, it's an alternative lifestyle.CAROLYeah, I'll say.
                         
          They reach the two elevators. Larry presses the call-button on the
          wall between the two elevators.LARRY'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR - INTERIOR NIGHTMedium shot inside the cabin of the elevator. The inner door
          slides open. Carol enters first, still reading her newspaper.
          Larry enters behind her and presses a button on the control panel.
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           Hold the elevator.
                         
           LILLIAN (voice over)
           I'm coming.
                         
          Hearing people's voices, Larry puts his hand on the edge of the
          door to keep it from closing.
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           Hold the elevator.
                         
          Paul and Lilian enter the elevator. They are a middle-aged couple.
          He is bald and tall, and very smily. She is small, with grey hair.LILLIANThat's right.PAULThank you.
                         
          Lilian has a broad smile when she recognizes Larry and Carol. The
          elevator door slides shut. Lilian looks at Carol.LILLIANI, uh, I see you at the gym sometimes.CAROLOh, you do ?LILLIANYeah, we live in the apartment down the hall.CAROLOh, well, I go whenever I have the discipline.LILLIANIt's important to put that time in. It does wonders.CAROLOh god, yeah. I agree with you.LILLIANExercising changed my life.CAROLWell, geez...LARRYI prefer to atrophy. I'm not a very exercise person.PAULWe bought a treadmill last week.CAROLOh, well, we had one. But you know, we got rid of it
           because it was just taking up too much space.LILLIANOh, it-it-it...LARRYBecause you have to turn it on and get on it once in a
           while. That was her problem.LILLIANHey, I... exactly, I... and it's so confusing, with all
           those buttons and computerized programs. I'm just never
           gonna get that.LARRY'S LANDING - HALLWAY - INTERIOR NIGHTFull shot of a very sober and modern hallway. Creme-colored walls,
          grey carpeting, dark wooden doors.
                         
          We hear the elevator door opening and Carol comes out, followed by
          Lilian, Larry and Paul. They all talk together and we can hardly
          understand the following dialogue.CAROLOh, I know. It's late.LILLIANIt's so wonderful, meeting.CAROLOh, well, yeah.PAULIt is just like New York. You have neighbors. You never
           meet them... You guys...
                         
          The following line, said by Lilian, is clearer and we understand
          it better.LILLIAN... I've seen you so many times in the hallway, you know...
           and I've always wanted to come up and say hallo.PAULWell, anyway... good night.
                         
          Larry and Carol walk away from Lilian and Paul, who remain near
          the elevator.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Good night. Such a lovely couple. You know that...
                         
          Paul bends down to pick up something on the carpet. Lilian walks
          one step in Larry's direction.LILLIANOh, uh, say, hello ?
                         
          Paul starts opening his apartment door, just across the hallway
          from the elevator.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Huh ? Yeah ?LILLIANHuh, listen... why don't you come in for a-a-a second and
           have a drink with us ? I mean, we'd really love that.
                         
          The camera pans around toward Larry and Carol. Larry makes a
          negative sign with his hand.CAROLOh, oh well that'd be fine...
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           She makes great Irish coffee.
                         
          Mute conversation between Carol and Larry. Larry evidently doesn't
          want to accept Lilian's invitation, but Carol wants to.
                         
           LILLIAN (voice over)
           Oh, please ? Uh uh, I want you to give me a treadmill
           lesson.LARRYThere's a movie on television I want to watch.
                         
          Carol starts walking toward Lilian and Paul's apartment, followed
          reluctantly by Larry.
                         
          The camera pans around during Carol's next line, and we see Carol
          entering Lilian an Paul's apartment.CAROLOh, about the tread... oh, well, if I can figure it out,
           then believe me, anybody can.
                         
          She laughs, and Larry, entering the apartment behind her, utters a
          forced laugh.PAUL'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHTThe cosy apartment of middle upper-class people. The decoration
          looks like them.
                         
          Medium shot of Lilian walking across the bedroom toward the large
          double bed. She walks near the famous treadmill.LILLIANHave a look at the instructions. They drive me crazy. You
           know ? I don't know what I'm doing at all. Let's look...
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           No. Please, it's easy.
                         
          Lilian picks up a book on a table near the bed.LILLIANWonderful book they've given me. Now I'm at level five.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           What ?LILLIANThat I know.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           You're that advanced ?LILLIANWell, yeah.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           God, I only got to level two.
                         
          Lilian brings the book to Carol.LILLIANLook at these diagrams. Do you believe this ?CAROLThat's amazing.
                         
          She is standing near the treadmill. Lilian shows her one of the
          diagram in the book.LILLIANI can't understand this even.CAROLLet me see.LILLIANYeah, well. See this ?CAROLOkay.PAUL'S APPARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHTOne of the wall could be a bay window, but, for the moment, it is
          entirely covered by a beige drape.
                         
          Medium shot of Paul bringing a stamp book to Larry.PAULNow, let me show you a mint 1933 airmail. Very rare... and
           very beautiful.
                         
          Larry is seated near a small table, on which Paul puts the book
          down. Paul sits down next to Larry.LARRYYeah.
                         
          Paul picks up a special philatelist magnifying glass and puts it
          in front of the stamp, for Larry to have a better look at it.PAULLook at that. And this plate block is quite unique because
           it has a flaw in the engraving. See if you can see it.
          Larry, who is not interested in philately at all, scratches his
          head.LARRYUh, it's hard for me.PAULActually I'll give you a little hint. Right down here in
           the corner.LARRYThat tiny thing there ?PAULInteresting, yeah.LARRYAh, you have a really...PAULThat makes it quite valuable, you see. And I just got a
           commemorative set of issues that are going to be quite
           valuable, too.
                         
          He picks up a transparent envelope inside which are several
          stamps.LARRYYes.PAULLook at the color, right there. All these are gonna become
           a real f...
                         
          Larry stands up.LARRYWell, listen... we're probably keeping you up, right ?PAULOh, no-no-no. This is wonderful.LARRYI should be going.PAULWhat do you do, if I may ask ?LARRYMe ? I'm in book publishing. I work up at Harper's.PAULAre you really ?LARRYYeah.PAULI own an old, uh, cinema. Having it redone.LARRYOh.PAULUsed to have a string of three, but, you know, business is
           not what it used to be.
                         
          He picks up some more stamps from the table.PAULNow, look at these presidentials. Look at the color work.
           Even the perforations are still intact.LARRYWhere's Carol ?PAULAll the...LARRYBecause I should really be going, actually.PAULOh, really ?LARRYYeah. I mean, so, we...
                         
          In the background, behind Larry, we see Carol and Lilian entering
          the room.LILLIANCoffee's ready !LARRYOh, coffee. I forgot coffee.
                         
          He turns around to face the women.
           PAUL (voice over)
           Good. We can get back to this later. Come on in.
                         
          We see Paul's hand on Larry's shoulder, pushing him toward the
          centre of the room.
                         
          A little later.
                         
          Full shot of the room. They are all seated around a low table,
          Larry and Carol on the sofa, Paul and Lilian on two armchairs.
          They've just finished their coffee.LILLIANWell, we've never had any children, but it's easy to
           empathize. Oh, um, uh, what college does your son attend ?CAROLBrown.LILLIANOh.PAULNice color.
                         
          They all laugh.LILLIANPaul never attended college. He's self-made.PAULAlways regretted it. I think knowledge is the second most
           important thing. First is health, then knowledge, then
           money.
                         
          Larry puts his cup down on the low table.LARRYYou know, it's amazing how time, we,... we'll just...LILLIANAnd, do you work ?
                         
          Larry stands up.CAROLHuh ? Do I ?LILLIANYes.
                         
          Larry looks at Carol and sits back on the sofa.CAROLOh, well, I actually, um, I used to work at an ad agency,
           but that was many years ago.
                         
          The camera moves closer to Carol and Larry.CAROLBut... You know, I've been seriously thinking of starting a
           little restaurant. But, well, Larry, he's trying to talk me
           out of it.LARRYOh, she's a great cook, though, really. Her duck and fennel
           omelette on a bed of scallops and Hollandaise sauce with
           truffles and sweetbreads'll make you snap into a fetal
           position and have you in bed screaming for a month.CAROLHe loves to tease me, but actually, he really loves exotic
           food.LILLIANMy weakness is any rich dessert, cream, butter, anything
           with fat.CAROLOh, really ? Oh well, let... listen... I'll fix you a
           dessert that'll make your eyeballs roll up. You'll have to
           exercise for a month to work it off.LILLIANYeah.
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           We're going to Le Cirque for our anniversary.CAROLNo, really ?
                         
          The camera moves around, away from Larry and Carol, to Paul.
                         
           LILLIAN (voice over)
           Yes. Twenty-eight years. November.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Really ?PAULWell, what do you buy the woman who buys everything ?
                         
          The camera moves around backward, away from Paul and back to Larry
          and Carol.LILLIANWe already have twin cemetery plots.LARRYWell, it's... I always think a Bentley is in good taste.
           You know, or you can go the route that I went with her. On
           her twentieth, I got her some very lovely handkerchiefs.CAROLYeah. Oh no. But, you know, they had my initials on them.LARRYYeah, it was a very, very high-class item. I didn't even
           know her size. I'm going over.
          Carol bursts out laughing.
                         
          Black screen. Actually, we are in :LARRY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHTCarol and Larry's apartment is quite different from the one we've
          just left. It is the apartment of a couple of New-York
          intellectuals, with nice, artistic furniture. We hear a door
          opening.LARRYJesus, couldn't you keep the conversation going a little
           longer in there ?
                         
          Lights are switched on.
                         
          Full shot. We see only part of the hall, the camera being in a
          corridor, and the walls of the corridor concealing part of the
          hall.
          Carol enters the apartment, and Larry holds the door for her.LARRYI was signaling you frantically.
                         
          Larry closes the door.CAROLI was just trying to be neighborly.LARRYNeighborly ? If this guy showed me his stamp collection one
           more time... I mean, my favorite thing in life is to, you
           know, look at canceled postage.
                         
          The camera follows Larry walking in the corridor toward :LARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHTActually there are two large beds in the bedroom, the room being
          divided by a partition set between the two beds. The partition is
          only a half wall. There is a opening, without door, at each end of
          the partition, to go from one section of the room to the other.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Oh, come on, Larry. It was sweet. They, you know, they're
           looking forward to their anniversary.
                         
          Medium shot of Larry taking his jacket off. He puts it on a chair.LARRYOh, and I'm looking forward to seeing that Bob Hope movie.
           I don't know why they put it on so late.
                         
          The camera turns back to the corridor and Carol, still in the
          front hall.CAROLYou know, do you think that's gonna happen to us ?
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           What ?
                         
          Carol walks in the corridor, toward the bedroom.CAROLWell, that we'll become like them ? You know, just another
           dull aging couple, you know, with our little walks, you
           know...
                         
          She walks into the bedroom.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           We are a dull aging couple.CAROLOur TV, our lox and bagels. And... and our twin cemetery
           plots ?
                         
          Larry is seated on his bed. Carol looks at some pills bottles on
          the night table.LARRYNo, we should be as lucky as them. To, you know, to be in
           their physical shape, at their age ? They look great. Did
           you see the dumbbells this guy lifts ? If I lifted
           dumbbells like those, I would get a hernia the size of the
           San Andrea's Fault.CAROLHow often do you think they make love ?
                         
          She goes out of the main part of the room, and the camera follows
          her.
                         
          She sits down on the other bed and starts taking her shoes off.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Oh, you know, probably more than we do, in their shape. You
           know, I'm sure as much as once a week.CAROLLarry ?
                         
           LARRY (voice over)

          Carol stands up from the bed and moves across the room. The
          camera, still located in the main part of the room, follows Carol,
          so we don't actually see her walking, but we see the partition and
          the large clock on it.
           CAROL (voice over from behind the partition)
           Yeah, but we're not turning into a pair of comfortable old

          This film is a very famous 1944 film directed by Billy Wilder, and
          referred by the Library of Congress as one of the hundred best
          films of the Twentieth Century. The term �double indemnity� refers
          to a clause in certain life insurance policies that doubles the
          payout in cases when death is caused by certain accidental means.

           on you.CAROLMe ?
                         
          She laughs. They have reached their building. The camera turns
          around to follows them inside the building. Larry puts his hand on
          Carol's back to guide her inside the building. We see an ambulance
          revolving light reflected in the glass door of the building.LARRYYeah. Why are you so stunned ? I think that...CAROLPlease. I mean, you know, I adore him, but you know, he's
           like a girlfriend to me.LARRYUh. Now he's divorced, you know ?CAROLDo I detect a note of jealousy ?

          They seem surprised by what they see on the landing. There is a

          a stretcher standing in the corridor. On the stretcher, a body -
          Lilian's body - is covered by a white sheet. Three men are
          standing near the stretcher, one of them wearing green gloves and

          coffee inside. She bends down and opens the cupboard door. Not

          turns around to look inside the cupboard above the sink. She
          closes it, and bends down to look inside the cupboard next to the

          its hook on the wall.CAROLOh, man.

          Larry, standing at the entrance of the kitchen.LARRYOkay. Are you happy ?

          Larry joins his wife in the hall.LARRYNow, can we back to bed ?CAROLNo.LARRYFor crying out loud, it's no big deal. You're making a

          The camera follows Carol to a reverse angle shot showing the
          workshop of Jack, the factotum caretaker of the building. With a
          screwdriver and a plier in his hands, he is working on something

          the workshop. She looks around, apparently looking for something.
          She peeks through the door of the workshop, to make sure Jack is
          not coming back too early. Carol rushes to a key-box on the wall,
          into which there is a spare key for every apartment in the
          building. She selects a key, takes it out of the box and puts it
          in her pocket. Then she leaves the workshop toward the staircase.LARRY'S LANDING - HALLWAY - INTERIOR DAYFull shot of the hallway. Carol comes out of the elevator, and
          looks around her. She walks back and forth in the hallway, before
          coming back to Paul's apartment door, just in front of the

          The camera zooms on Paul. He has almost crossed the street, but he
          suddenly stops a few feet from the next sidewalk. He feels his
          jacket : apparently he has forgotten something in his apartment.
          He turns around and starts walking back on the crosswalk.PAUL'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAYCarol is still looking in all the cupboards of the kitchen. She
          gets out of the kitchen into the living-room.PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAYThe camera pans around the room, following Carol, who looks inside

           crazy. Go, leave, leave, leave.PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAYCarol puts the phone down on the desk. She stands and turns around

          Black screen shot on the front door in the dark of the corridor,
          then the camera quickly spins around to show Carol, standing in
          the living-room, with a frightened look on her face. She walks
          away from the room. The camera spins back to the front door, which
          opens. Paul enters and switches the lights on. He closes the front
          door, and walks along the corridor to the living-room.
                         
          Carol walks into the kitchen from the living-room.

          looks through all the documents scattered on the desk.
                         
          The camera pans back to Carol, hiding in the kitchen, then back to
          Paul.
          Paul opens both his hands in a gesture of despair : apparently, he
          hasn't found what he was looking for. He starts walking across the
          room, and the camera pans back to Carol in the kitchen. She rushes
          out of the kitchen.
                         
          The camera remains at the same spot, and we see Paul in the

          He closes the closet, and starts looking through the documents he
          has found. He puts them inside the inner pocket of his jacket. He

          He puts the phone down on its hook, and starts walking out of the
          room. He stops, thinks for a couple of seconds, turns around, sits
          on the bed and picks up the phone.
          Back to Carol under the bed. The bed frame hits her back when Paul
          sits on it. She looks up. We hear Paul dialing a number.

          apartment.NEW-YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAYStarting from street level, the camera tilts up along a very
          modern office building, all glass and steel. A sign, above the
          main entrance, says �10 East 53�. This is the building where
          Larry's office is located.LARRY'OFFICE - INTERIOR DAYFull shot of a large office room. In the forefront, a reception
          desk, with a young female receptionist talking to someone we still
          don't see. Coming from the other end of the room, Larry is walking
          with Marcia, a tall dark-haired lady, wearing sunglasses.LARRYSo, I thought your rewrites were great. I really think you
           helped your book, you know ? It's... It's dense a little
           bit, but, uh...MARCIAWell, I don't want it to be too transparent, I mean...
                         
          They are now at the reception desk level, and, since the camera is
          following them, we can see the young gentleman the receptionist is
          talking with.LARRYThat's... That's something you're never gonna have to worry
           about, you know ? This book makes �Finnegan's Wake� look

           suggestions from, but even you shouldn't push it.LARRYNo, I'm not pushing it. I think the book is great.
           Absolutely great. You know, but, uh... how much, how much
           of Dorothy is you? As I was reading it, I kept thinking how
           much is... you know, how much did you base it on your own
           life ?
          They have now reached a smaller room, actually Larry's private
          room. Marcia takes her glasses off, and then her coat, and sits on
          a sofa.MARCIAWell, I was a waitress. I lived with a poet. I was a film
           critic.

          the room, looking through some documents.LARRYOh, really ? Do you still play ?

           I could turn your game around in two hours.LARRYCould you ? That's great. That's... you know, you-you have
           all these skills, and you're beautiful, and you can write
           so well... and now it turns out you play poker. This is,
           uh, too good to be true.
                         
          Larry sits down with the pile of documents on his laps. The camera
          pans back to Marcia. She has a cigarette in her hand.MARCIAWell, I wouldn't say beautiful.

           MARCIA (voice over)
           No. Don't let my confidence fool you, it's a facade. Why do
           you ask ?LARRYBecause I have a friend who became single recently, and I-I
           know he would get a big kick out of you.
                         
           MARCIA (voice over)
           Oh. So, when do you want your poker lessons ?LARRYUh, next week. I could take you to lunch. We could-we

          in order on the desk. Larry walks to her, and whisper something we

          located slightly above street level. Carol is seated in front of
          the window, looking very pensive. She takes a sip of her glass of
          wine. She looks absently though the window.NEW-YORK - A LOUNGE - INTERIOR DAYThe street seen through the window, next to which Carol is seated,
          but we don't actually see Carol. We see a big car, followed by a
          bus. The camera zooms on the bus. Through one of the bus windows,
          we see a woman, seated inside the bus. And this woman looks very
          much like the deceased Lilian, Paul's wife.NEW-YORK - STREET IN FRONT OF THE LOUNGE - EXTERIOR DAYClose shot on the window, in front of which Carol is seated. She
          looks at the passing bus, with a wide open mouth, and a surprised,

          Lilian on board of it. They walk near the entrance of the

          Only two people, Larry and Marcia, are seated at a table behind a
          set of crossed wooden bars, on the other side of which the camera
          is located. Apparently Marcia is teaching Larry how to play poker.

          The camera pans back on Larry and Marcia. This is a different
          shot, with the camera in front of their table. Marcia seems very
          relaxed with the cards in her hands, when Larry seems quite
          nervous. He holds the card very close to his eyes, seeming afraid
          that his partner will look at them.MARCIAYou seem in a strange mood.LARRYNo, no, no. I'm just probably just a little drunk.MARCIAOn Perrier ?LARRYNo. What are you talking about ? I had rum cake.MARCIAWant any cards ?

          Two plainclothes police officers and one uniformed policeman are
          talking with Carol and Larry. They both try to explain the
          situation to the police officers. But since they both talk
          together, the police officers have a hard time understanding them.
                         
          While they are talking, the camera zooms forward from a long shot
          to a full shot of the group.

          The camera pans from the uniformed policeman to the two police
          officers talking with Carol and Larry in the middle of the room.
          The following dialogue transcript separates what Larry says from
          what Carol says, but, most of the time, they talk together at the
          same time, making it quite difficult for us, or for the police
          officers, to follow their conversation.CAROLBecause, I mean, she was, she was there, do you

          We hear a click coming from the door of the room.LARRYShhh !...
                         
          Larry picks up a metal lamp from the floor and hides behind a
          closet in front of the door with Carol behind him. The door opens
          and the cleaning lady walks in with her bucket and things. Larry
          is ready to hit her, but, when he realizes who she is, he drops
          the lamp. The cleaning lady yells.CLEANING LADYAhhh !... Oh, Jesus! What...LARRYI'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm... Didn't mea... I-I, oh, it's-

           no-no-no croissants tomorrow for breakfast.
                         
          He takes some money out of his pocket and gives it to her.LARRYHere, here. Here, take this for yourself. I like the
           towels. Keep the little mints coming on the pillow, uh...
                         
          He closes the door.CAROLOh, Jesus. Larry. I mean, really.LARRYLet's go. That's why the light was on. This is crazy, we're
           gonna get in trouble.CAROLJust a second, Larry. Let me just look around here, just a
           little bit.
                         
          Larry picks up the lamp which is broken in two pieces.LARRYOh, look. I did damage. I... Now. I'll be sued.

           Oh ! Larry !LARRYThat's what ?
                         
          Carol comes back to Larry, holding something small in her hand.CAROLLarry, look. Look. I thinks that's her wedding band, Larry.LARRYHow do you know ?CAROLHow do I know ? I saw it on her.LARRYYou did ?CAROLYeah.LARRYJesus.CAROLI think so.LARRYSo much for the police combing every inch of this place.
           Where did you find it ?CAROLI found it behind the door, right there.LARRYOh, brother. Let's get out of here, come on. And take the
           ring with you. Maybe there's a pawnshop open.CAROLOkay. Okay.
                         
          Larry opens the door and they walk out of the room.HOTEL WALDRON - ELEVATOR CABIN - INTERIOR NIGHTMedium shot inside the cabin. The elevator is moving down.CAROLDidn't I tell you the police weren't thorough ? I mean they
           probably thought we were cranks, right ? I mean, we got no
           body, and... I mean, they must get fifty crisis calls a
           minute. Why would they bother with us ?LARRYI don't know. I just know, this is very deep stuff.CAROLJust...LARRYWe should not be here. I'm scared, this is creepy. You know
           what I mean ? This goes... this could be... Who knows who's
           involved in this ? This could go very deep, Carol. This
           could be like, you know, like with the Warren commission,
           or something. I don't like it.CAROLOh, not the Warren Commission.
                         
          There is a loud noise and the elevator suddenly stops.CAROLOh, my God !LARRYJesus ! What is that ?CAROLWait a minute. Okay, all right, now look. All right. The-
           the elevator's probably stuck.LARRYWhy are we stopping ? Why are we stopping ?CAROLRelax now, Larry.
                         
          Carol starts punching all the buttons on the control panel.LARRYDon't tell me to relax ! I'm-I'm-I'm a-a world-renowned

           Uh, Larry, relax. Now, if you just don't panic, okay ?
           Don't panic, all right ?LARRYI'm not panicking, I'm not panicking, I'm...CAROLNow, just don't worry.LARRYI'm just going to say the rosary, now.CAROLSomebody'll help us. Somebody's gonna help us. Somebody'll

          Close shot on Larry's distorted face. We see Carol's body going
          up.LARRYOh, Jesus, you've got to cut down on those rich desserts.CAROLOh, wait a minute, now ! Oh, just wait ! Wait, wait !LARRYLet's go, my life is passing in front of my eyes. The worst
           part of it is, I'm driving a used car.CAROLOkay, now you'd think they'd loosen this stupid thing.
                         
          Medium close shot on the ceiling of the cabin. Carol is trying to
          open a trap above the ceiling lamp.LARRYI'm scared.
                         
          The trap opens, and Lilian House's body comes out. Carol yells and
          falls down on the floor. The upper part of the body is hanging out
          of the trap, with its arms moving around.CAROLOh, my God !LARRYOh, my God. It's her.
                         
          The camera tilts down to floor level and Larry and Carol.CAROLSo that's where he hid her.LARRYOh, Jesus. Claustrophobia and a dead body. This is a
           neurotic's jackpot.
                         
          Suddenly, the lights switch off. The cabin is now pitch dark.CAROLOh ! Oh, Larry, hold on. I'm scared.
                         
          We hear the noise of the elevator starting again.LARRYWe're going down.CAROLOh, God. What's happening ?LARRYWe're going down.CAROLOh, God, press up ! Press up !LARRYPress up ? I can't see my hand. How can I press up ? Jesus.CAROLWe must be heading for the basement, Larry.LARRYThe basement. I want to get off in the mezzanine. I'm
           returning shoes. It's dark in here.
                         
          We hear the noise of the elevator door opening.CAROLWhat ? What are you doing ?
                         
          Apparently Carol has come out of the elevator.HOTEL WALDRON - BASEMENT - INTERIOR NIGHTThis shot is supposed to be in the basement of the hotel, but
          since it is still pitch dark, we can't tell the difference.LARRYWhere are you... I'm getting back on the elevator. I don't
           care.CAROLI don't know where... Larry.LARRYI-I can't see anything.CAROLThere's nothing out there. Wait a minute. What are you
           doing ?
          Larry lights a match, and we see his scared face lit by the flame
          of the match.CAROLHey, what are you doing with matches ?LARRYTh-Th-These are my matches. I got them at...CAROLWait a minute, what... When were you at the �Caf� des
           Artistes� ?

           At-at the... At...CAROLAt the �Caf� des Artistes� ?LARRYYeah, b... A French, a French authoress. An author.
                         
          He lights another match. We very dimly see the basement walls
          around them.CAROLWait. Shh ! Shh ! Shh !LARRYJesus.CAROLTry this way.
                         
          Medium full shot of Carol and Larry walking toward us in a
          corridor. Beside the light of the match, there is some other dim
          light coming from somewhere in the basement.LARRYI like a basement with-with knotty pine and a pool table.
           You know, where you can...CAROLHey, look, look, look, look. Uh-huh.
                         
          They are now in close shot.LARRYWhat ? What ?CAROLWhat's this ?LARRYI... No, wait a minute. Not so fast. I don't like it here,
           it's dank.
          The camera turns around to follow them in the corridor.CAROLAll right.LARRYAnd there's strange noises. I don't know what this is. I
           don't know. This...
                         
          We hear a loud metallic bang.LARRYOh, Jesus !CAROLCalm down.LARRYCalm down ? Don't tell me to calm down.CAROLThere. Turn the light on.
          Larry switches the light on. They are in a room with beige walls.
          There are pots of paint stacked behind Larry.LARRYThis... Wh-Wh... I-I don't... What do you...CAROLLet me see.
                         
          Carol tries to open a door near Larry, but it is locked.CAROLWhere... There. Oh. We're locked in here. What are you
           gonna do ?LARRYOh, relax, relax, relax. Don't... I'll break it down. Stand
           back.
                         
          Larry walks back a few steps and rushes on the door, trying to
          break it open.CAROLCareful, now.LARRYDon't worry. Just-Just give me a second.
                         
          He does it another time.CAROLDon't hurt yourself.LARRYMust be one of those new doors.CAROLLet's try out here.
                         
          Carol points to another room opening in the one they are in.
                         
          Carol and Larry are now walking in a lit corridor.LARRYOh, my god. I keep hearing noises.CAROLOh. What's down there ?
                         
          Carol walks rapidly toward a dark section of the corridor. The
          camera follows her.LARRYWhere ? Where you... Where are you going ? Don't leave me.CAROLLet me see. It's okay. What ? Oh !
                         
          She has reached a door with a barred window showing the street
          outside.CAROLYeah. I think this is it. I think this is the service
           entrance.
                         
          She tries to open the door, but it is a bit stuck.LARRYWell, come on.CAROLI'm trying.LARRYCome on, get it open.
                         
          Carol succeeds in opening the door.CAROLI got it. I got it.LARRYGo into a trot.
                         
          They rush outside.NEW-YORK - STREET OUTSIDE THE WALDRON HOTEL - EXTERIOR NIGHTLong shot on the dark street. At a distance, we see a man putting
          a large oblong-shaped parcel in the trunk of a car. The man looks
          very much like Paul.
                         
          The camera pans around to give us a reverse-angle medium shot of
          Carol and Larry coming out of the basement of the hotel. They
          stopped in the middle of the short staircase.CAROLWait ! Wait ! Did you see that ?LARRYWhat ?CAROLIt looks like somebody's putting a body into a car.LARRYJesus.CAROLI swear. Look. It's got a white sheet on it.LARRYYes.CAROLRight... Yeah. Come on.

          Larry.LARRYIt is. Oh, brother.
                         
          The camera pans back around to give us a reverse-angle shot of the
          car leaving the curb of the street.

          The camera pans back around again to give a reverse-angle medium
          long shot of Carol and Larry running toward their car.LARRYI'm not going to follow. I'm not gonna... I don't wanna
           follow him.CAROLNo, let's follow it.

          then pans to the bridge itself. At this early hour of the night,
          the bridge still has a lot of traffic moving on it. Then the
          camera moves down to get a closer look of the traffic on the

          also follows Larry's car, even though, from this height, we can't
          tell which car it is.

          They reach the other car surrounded by huge piles of metal scrap.
          The car and the scenery around it are lit by a powerful red light.
          Carol and Larry run toward the place where the red light comes
          from. It is inside a huge building. But they don't go inside the
          building and, instead, keep on running along the building.

          stage floor, a white circle, on which there is a chair and a small
          table with a telephone. Suzanne Raphael, a young woman, is
          auditioning. She is seated on the chair, holding the telephone.
          Behind Suzanne, which is the left side of the stage seen from the
          audience, a white wall, with a doorless opening. On either side of
          the wall, two red columns. And on either side of the girl, which
          are the front and the back of the stage, two red metallic frames.
          In front of the girl, a video camera on a tripod, with an operator
          standing behind the camera. Actually, the operator is Sy, Larry
          and Carol's friend, whom we have seen much earlier in the film, in
          the antique market and at Elaine's restaurant. The stage is well
          lit, when the audience hall is in the dark.SUZANNEYeah, well, Dad, you know, I've heard just about enough of

          right side of the stage, where there is several rows of theatre
          seats and a table in front of the seats. Ted, Marcia and Marilyn
          are seated in the front row. Marilyn is Sy's wife, whom we have
          also seen earlier in the film. Carol is seated in the second row,

          her hands trough her hair, takes another breathing, and picks up
          the phone handset from the telephone on the table. She overdoes it
          a lot, trying to act as the prima dona she is not.HELENYeah, okay.

          phone in her hand any more. She is holding a script and looking at

           He never even did that. He went and shot Broome. And that
           was not part of the plan. Broome might have got to the
           police before he died.
                         
          Larry walks around the backstage, trying to find his way. We see
          the black and white film on the screen, but also reflections of
          the screen on the multiple mirrors scattered around the backstage.

          Behind Paul, we see the film on the screen. We have now reached
          the famous last scene of the film, shot in the hall of mirrors.
          Rita Hayworth's face is reflected on the many mirrors in the film,
          just like, in the actual scene in the backstage, Paul and Larry

          Arthur's figure, walking with a cane, is reflected in the many
          mirrors in the film. Just the same, Gladys, who has just entered
          the backstage, walking with a cane, is also reflected on the
          mirrors scattered around her. She has a gun in the hand which is
          not holding the cane.
                         
          While Gladys and Paul are talking, the film keeps on showing on
          the screen behind them, but we do not understand the words from
          the film, because Paul and Gladys' voices are louder.GLADYSHallo, Paul. Didn't you expect me ?
