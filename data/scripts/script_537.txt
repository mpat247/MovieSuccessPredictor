HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOUWritten byAbby Kohn & Marc SilversteinJuly 20, 2007EXT. PARK - DAYWe float down through a serene, leafy park to the
          children's play area. There, in the sandbox, a BEAUTIFUL
          FIVE YEAR OLD GIRL plays among a group of kids.GIGI (V.O.)I have a theory about how this all
                    started...A SIX YEAR OLD BOY approaches. He watches the little
          girl for a moment as she gently shapes her sand castle.And then - out of nowhere - THE LITTLE BOY PUSHES THELITTLE GIRL DOWN.LITTLE GIRLWhy did you do that?LITTLE BOYBecause you smell like dog poo.Some of the other kids SNICKER at this brilliant one-
          liner. Our little girl's face turns red.LITTLE BOY (CONT'D)You're so stupid just like dog poo!
                    You're made of poo!And then, just to punctuate, he JUMPS ON THE SANDCASTLE,
          smashing it. Finally, our little girl starts to CRY.INT. KITCHEN - DAYOur beautiful girl sits at a kitchen table with her MOM.
          She can only get out one syllable between big, wet sobs.LITTLE GIRLMade. (SOB)   Of. (SOB)   Dog. (SOB)   Poo.MOMHoney, do you know why that little boy
                    did those things? And said those things?The little girl shakes her head no.MOM (CONT'D)Because he LIKES YOU.FREEZE FRAME ON OUR LITTLE GIRL'S FACE - TRYING TOPROCESS THIS.17/20/7                                                 2.GIGI (V.O.)Uh - excuse me -- but what - the - HELL?
                    Where did that rumor start? Because moms
                    have been spreading it for years.BACK TO THE SCENE - THE MOM CONTINUES...MOMThat little boy is doing those terrible
                    things because he HAS A CRUSH ON YOU.We see our little girl take this in, like she is just now
          beginning to understand the ways of the world.GIGI (V.O.)Do you understand what this means? We
                    are all encouraged to believe that if a
                    guy acts like a total jerk -- that means
                    he likes you. Sure, that's a lesson that
                    might serve us as five year olds, but
                    many of us keep believing this advice
                    well into adulthood.INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHTA CUTE COLLEGE GIRL sits CRYING in front of her ANSWERING

                    same...The machine evilly flashes 0 in the NEW MESSAGES window.ROOMMATE #1That Phi Delt so obviously liked you.

                    secretary when I came home early from the
                    Maldives. So unoriginal, it made me feel
                    sorry for him. My second husband was a
                    pinch more creative. Cheated on me with
                    my sister - but made me believe that I

           PIANO starts to play on a tiny stage - empty. And then -
           a terrified but determined Anna takes her place in front
           of the mic. And begins to SING.It's a "THE LAST GOODBYE" by JEFF BUCKLEY - barely
           recognizable - more of a torch song. As she sings, she

                     before we give them away.Beth dutifully puts her hands in the pockets. And then
           she FEELS SOMETHING. Her face registers curiosity as she
           pulls out - A BLACK VELVET RING BOX. Beth looks at it,
           and when she looks up - Neil's down ON ONE KNEE.NEIL (CONT'D)I love you so much. So much. I want to
                     make you happy. I need to make you happy
