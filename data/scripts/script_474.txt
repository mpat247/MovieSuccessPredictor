          I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to
          present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable
          to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed
          to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind,
          that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what
          is good and acceptable and perfect. -Romans 12:1-2EXT. THE SHAW'S HOUSE - FRONT LAWN - NIGHTA perfect suburban house with bay windows and a front lawn.

          Rose smiles at him.ROSEWe're here.EXT. ARMITAGE ESTATE - AFTERNOONThe woods give way to an huge front lawn. A large mansion sits
          in the middle. Thick forest surrounds the estate except for
          one side which is the edge of a lake. The property feels
          expensive and isolated; no other houses in sight.
                         
          As they drive through the large front lawn, Chris sees WALTER,
          African American 35 in the distance facing away. Walter wears
          a gardening hat and trims hedges. He works slowly and
          methodically.17.ROSE(TO CHRIS)That's the grounds-keeper... I
                   think his name is Walter.
                         
          Rose parks in front of the house, and. He has a pleasant
          smile. Rose gets out of the car and waves.ROSE (CONT'D)Hi!

          Walter waves silently. Odd.
                         
          As Chris gets the luggage from the trunk, Rose runs to the
          front door and RINGS the DOORBELL. FOOTSTEPS. The door swings
          open revealing...
                         
          DEAN ARMITAGE, 59, a tall, balding, barrel-chested, bear hug
          of a man. Though clearly smart, Dean has an endearing
          cockiness and a bad case of Dad humor. He is the kind of guy
          who pronounces garbage, Gar-bahge.
                         
          And... MISSY ARMITAGE, 56, A beautiful beacon of intellectual
          patience. She is poised and warm; relaxed and in control. They
          stand in the shadows of the doorway smiling. Rose hugs her

          the door behind them.
                         
          Outside, Walter watches as his smile fades away. He slowly
          turns and goes back to work.19.INT. ARMITAGE LIVING ROOM - DAYA wonderful house looms ahead. The interior is worldly and
          interesting; clean and homey. Several paintings of castles and

ARMITAGE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAYRose and Chris take their bags upstairs.INT. ARMITAGE HOUSE - ROSE'S BEDROOM - DAYRose's old room is preserved in the state of a young-minded
          teenage girl. Lots of pink and dated boy band posters, a

                   areas, two study's, two main
                   kitchens. There's an observatory
                   wing on the top floor. And you'd
                   be hard pressed to find a room
                   that doesn't serve as library.
                         
          Chris zones in on a photograph taken in the 90's in front of
          the Armitage house. Dean and Missy are younger, and Rose and
          her brother Jeremy are kids.DEAN (CONT'D)That's Jeremy. Rose's brother.

          race.DEAN (CONT'D)My Dad was a runner. A good
                   runner; great sprinter.23.DEAN (CONT'D)Oh, In fact, you might find this
                   interesting, he was just beat out

                   round for the `36 Olympics in

                   stood out in my mind.DEANOf course. One of those perfect

                   race, and here comes this black
                   guy to prove him wrong on the

          Dean winks.HOUSE - MISSY'S OFFICE - DAYDean opens the door to the office. He and Chris stand outside
          the door as Dean reaches in to turn on the lights. In front of
          the desk two comfortable-looking chairs face each other. Books
          line the walls, and are stacked everywhere. Dean and Chris
          don't enter. A white cat laying next to a teacup wakes up on
          the desk.DEANOkay Snowbell just looking.(TO CHRIS)Missy's office. This is where she
                   takes appointments.CHRISShe's a Therapist right?DEANYeah. One of the best in the

          Missy walks out of the dining room into the kitchen. The door
          swings open and Chris gets another glimpse of Georgina who
          stands with a kitchen knife and wears an intense and wicked
          little smile. The door swings shut.DEANOkay, new subject. Chris, Yanks or

          Dean is loud and stern for the first time. Jeremy's eyes
          flutter, DRUNK and embarrassed. He grabs a wine bottle and
          goes upstairs`.ROSEAnd that's my brother.34.EXT. THE ESTATE. NIGHTFull moon. CRICKETS.INT. ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHTRose and Chris make hushed love in her bed. A stuffed lion

          ear. He smacks his own head and sits up. A soft HOWL of WIND
          rushes through the room. The CLOSET DOOR CREEKS open.

          down the hallway past the pictures towards the kitchen.
                         
          The basement door is open a crack. Chris peers into it
          curiously. A stairwell leads down into pitch darkness. Chris
          shuts the door. A figure now stands at the end of the hallway
          behind him. He doesn't notice. He just keeps going into...INT. ARMITAGE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUSChris walks through the kitchen. He bumps into a bar chair

          across the lawn again. A moment of terror comes over Chris. He
          makes out a shape. It's now running towards him. Chris backs
          up in fear just as the figure emerges from the shadows and
          into the moonlight. It's Walter, the grounds keeper. He passes
          Chris without noticing. Chris gathers his breath.
                         
          The kitchen light turns on and floods the backyard. Chris
          drops the cigarette and stomps it out. He turns back towards
          the house and finds himself face to face with Georgina, who
          glares through the window dead in Chris' eyes. He's caught.

                   Logan! They were asking me about
                   the African American experience.

          Andre/Logan is a little caught off guard but dives in.ANDRE/LOGANMy life as an African American has
                   been, for the most part, very
                   good. It's hard to be too specific
                   as I haven't much desired to leave

          Everyone turns to Chris. Andre/Logan steps forward and looks

          grip off of Chris. When they do Andre/Logan screams

          now. He packs his small bag and looks out the window. One car
          remains parked in the designated parking area. It's the first
          to have arrived for the party: Jim Hudson's. The driver brings
          the dog to the back seat. He gets a green envelope from the
          glove compartment and brings it to Missy at the front door.
          She accepts it silently.
                         
          The driver drives away without Jim.
                         
          Chris goes to leave Rose's room. Her closet creaks open. Chris
          sees a framed picture of Rose inside. Not quite knowing what
          he's looking for, he goes to the closet. The picture is a
          frightening one. Rose is one of the witches in a high school
          production of Macbeth. It's on top of a red shoebox that has
          the drama/comedy masks drawn on top of it.
                         
          He takes it off of the shelf. Inside is a pile of pictures. On
          top is one of Rose dressed as Juliet in a high school play.72.The next one is of Rose at 13 playing Ms. Hannigan in Annie.

          ages in different class plays.
                         
          Finally Chris comes upon a photo printed from a computer. It's
          a selfie of her and some other black guy. The picture is
          almost identical to the one she took with Chris before the
          ride up. Under the image are written the words. "X-mas 2014"
          Stunned, Chris flips to the next picture. It's another
          romantic selfie, this time with a different black guy.
          Underneath, the caption "Memorial Day 2013"
                         
          He continues flipping through the stack of pictures of Rose
          with 8 different black guys. The last one is a picture of Rose
          with Walter. In it she kisses Walter's cheek intimately.
          "Thanksgiving 2009" Walter looks different in the picture. He
          isn't smiling vaguely; he's got swagger.ROSE(EMOTIONLESS)What are you doing?

          Rose is truly distant for the first time. A different person.

          is now phoning it in.ROSEI was just looking for them. I'm

          makes you feel any better, I'm
          thirsty too.CHRISI need to get outta here.JIMRight. So, the reason I am talking
          to you now is so you can
          understand what is happening to
          you. I guess your `understanding'
          it raises the success rate of this
          whole thing. Not even sure I

          you dirty dog. You're one of the

          wrangling method sounds way less
          pleasant.CHRISIs this some kind of a game to
          you?JIMThey asked me for my favorite
          song, which was hard; I like all
          types of music. Turns out they
          really just needed one I knew all

          Taylor's "You Got a Friend." I
          hope it hasn't been too torturous;
          that wasn't the point. The point
          is that you learn it, and for us
          to have that knowledge in common.CHRISWho the fuck are you people?JIMOh right. Okay, let me back up and
          give you the cliff notes. The
          Armitages and I are a part of a

                   lineage redefined the nature of
                   that search. They proved that the
                   power didn't just exist in that
                   object; You see, with science the
                   Armitage's created a miracle.CHRISYou hypnotize me? Break my will..?
                   Make me a slave like the others?

                   sedate you. Oh, that and to
                   prepare you psychologically...CHRISFor what?
                         
          Jim smiles.JIMFor the procedure.CHRISWhat's the procedure?JIMAre you ready...? Drum roll
                   please. Brain transplantation.
                   Some say it could never be done;JIM (CONT'D)They experimented for centuries,
                   but it turned out re-linking the
                   brain to a foreign central nervous
                   system was impossible. The nerve
                   connections are far too intricate
                   and delicate.89.CHRISWhat the fuck?JIMDean's the only guy who really
                   gets the science. He's the one who
                   discovered that full brain
                   transplantation isn't actually
                   necessary to transfer the soul,
                   and that partial brain
                   transplantation solves the little
                   nerve ending problem.CHRISNo.
                         
          Jim holds up a Color coded diagram of the human Brain. There
          is a big red part that takes up 80% of the image. The other
          20% is blue and located near the lower back of his skull.JIMOkay so... You see the blue part?
                   That's the piece of your brain
                   that's all rooted in the nervous
                   system. So that stays; keeping
                   those tricky little connections
                   intact. The rest is discarded.
                   Then they'll remove the red part
                   of my brain from my skull and put
                   in yours. Your "blue" and my "red"
                   basically absorb each other. And
                   apparently the brain heals
                   surprisingly fast, so assuming
                   everything goes as planned, we
                   should be up and functioning in a
                   couple weeks.CHRISAnd my brain?JIMYour red part? It'll be discarded,
                   but don't worry. You wont be gone.
                   Well not completely. You'll still
                   be in there somewhere; limited
                   consciousness of course;JIM (CONT'D)you'll still be able to see and
                   hear but your existence will be as

          The television turns off. Chris clenches his body trying to
          pry free from his restraints, before his shoulders collapse
          with exhaustion. He lifts his head to a rip in the leather arm
          of the chair revealing its cotton stuffing. He looks at the
          cotton. We see Chris make a difficult decision.LATER...We hear nothing except a HEART BEAT.

          The Television turns on. On the screen, a woman's hand holds a
          tea cup. With a spoon, she clinks it. We don't hear it though.

          Rose enters wearing a white and black nurse's outfit with a
          red cross on the chest. She rolls a medical table into the
          room. She draws a dotted line across his forehead and around
          to the back of his scalp. Then she unstraps his arm and
          prepares it for an IV. She inserts the needle.
                         
          She goes to put earbuds connected to an ipod in his ears but
          sees the arm of his chair has been stripped open. She looks at

          Then, through the agony, her face curls into a twisted smile.
          She's having fun. Psycho. Rose goes limp in Chris' hands.92.Chris takes the cotton out of his ears. We can hear again.

          racket. He pulls Jeremy inside and shuts the door cutting off

          it to put Chris in a choke hold from behind. Chris slams the
          back of his head into Jeremy's face. He does it again, and
          again, and again. Jeremy squeezes tighter.
                         
          Chris, about to pass out, reaches into Jeremy's pocket and
          pulls out his keys. He scrapes them deep into Jeremy's eye.

          Chris again but slips on his own blood banging the back of his
          head on the coffee table. He's out.EXT. FRONT YARD - NIGHTChris begins to run but then sees the beige sports car we
          recognize from the opening scene. He looks at Jeremy downed in
          the doorway and then at the keys in his hand.
                         
          Moments later...INT. SPORTS CAR - NIGHTChris is in the driver's seat. The tubular metal helmet sits
          next to him in the passengers seat. His phone finally turns
          on. There is a very small amount of batteries. He turns the
          ignition. The English to French tutorial comes on.TUTORIALI seem to have misplaced my
                   passport. Je crois avoi egare mon

          night. He dials 911.911 OPERATOR911 emergency, I'm at the home of
                   Dean and Missy Armitage--
                         
          Chris looks in the rearview mirror as the house gets smaller
          behind him. All of a sudden, BAM! The car slams into and over
          Georgina, who, in the night, seems to come out of nowhere. The
          phone falls.CHRISAhhhh!TUTORIALCan you direct me to the nearest
                   hospital? Pouvez-vous me diriger

          He drives on a few more seconds on a flat tire but then stops
          the car. Chris breathes heavy.CHRIS(TO HIMSELF)No... no... Don't do it... Just
                   get the fuck gotta here... Just

          motionless bloody heap that is Georgina.TUTORIALWhere is the nearest train

          He looks back at the house which is now filling with smoke.
                         
          Chris quickly gets out of the car and lifts what's left of
          Georgina's mangled unconscious body into the passenger's seat
          of the car. He shuts the door and gets in the driver's seat.
          He floors it.
                         
          After a moment of driving, Georgina's eyes open and she rises.
          The wig slides off her head revealing an old surgical scar
          around the top of her head. Chris hasn't noticed her yet. He
          reaches for his phone.TUTORIAL (CONT'D)Can you please call the police?
                   Pouvez-vous s'il vous plait

          Annoyed, Chris turns off the sound system just before Georgina
          grabs his face and scratches it.96.GEORGINAAhhhhh!!CHRISAhhhhhhhh!!
                         
          Chris, veers the car into a tree. Georgina`s head hits the
          windshield hard and bursts open. She's dead. So is the car.
                         
          A bullet hits the rear view mirror. Jeremy stands in front of
          the smoking house with a hunting rifle. He's soaked in blood.JEREMY(THROUGH TEARS)Grandma!!!!

          Walter is grandpa and he's so fast.JEREMY (CONT'D)Get him!!!
                         
          Chris crawls out of the car as Walter/Grandpa sprints across
          the front lawn strait at him. Walter's hat flies off revealing
          the surgical scar around his head like the others.
                         
          Jeremy shoots again, and it grazes Chris' side. Chris runs
          through the trees. Walter/grandpa closes the gap quickly.
          Another shot hits a tree. As Chris reaches the road, Walter/
          Grandpa pounces like a jaguar and rolls him over on his back.
          He pushes his thumbs into Chris' eyes.GRANDPADamn you to Hell!!!

          chris' head.GRANDPA (CONT'D)You ruined everything!!!
                         
          Chris, blinded, raises his phone to Walter/Grandpa's face. He
          takes a picture, flashing strait into Walter/Grandpa's eyes.97.Walter/Grandpa doesn't shoot. Instead he looks up. Jeremy is
          confused as to why Walter/Grandpa has stopped.JEREMYWhat...? Grandpa--?
                         
          Walter/Grandpa spins and gathers his bearing. His eye is
          cocked and blood trickles out of his nose. He let's out a
          PAINED MOAN reminiscent of the deer's.WALTER/GRANDPAAhhhhhhh!
                         
          Walter/Grandpa shoots Jeremy in the chest. He falls. Chris, on
          his back, pushes himself away. Walter/Grandpa sees Chris'
          scurry. He turns looking mad.CHRISWait.
                         
          Walter/Grandpa raises the gun under his own chin and shoots
          himself through the head. He falls. Approaching sirens blare
          in the distance.
                         
          Chris lays in shock. It's over. Just then a hand grabs Chris
          face! Jeremy's still alive! Blood pours from his mouth.JEREMYAhhhhhh!
                         
          They both go for the gun, grabbing it at the same time. They
          roll around in the grass. Chris ends up on top. He bludgeons
          Jeremy over and over with the butt of the gun into the ground.
          Chris is lost in violence.
