mix of first class people: OLD MONEY in Gucci enjoying
freshly baked cookies, a MILLIONAIRE in jeans and a T-
shirt, BUSINESS PEOPLE relaxing after a tough day, and...

...a very nervous MAN.

Shifty-eyed. Alone in an aisle seat, the emergency row.
We hold on him for a moment, but not for too long. Then
we continue moving into --THE COACH SECTIONStopping at the lavatory, the "OCCUPIED" sign switches to
"VACANT" and...JAMES EARL JONES(or actually, a James Earl Jones type, who for ease of
description, we'll simply refer to as James Earl Jones)
steps out of the restroom, in full African regalia:
multi-colored dashiki, mufti (it's a kind of hat), the
works. He heads up the aisle towards --THE FIRST CLASS CABINWhere he is stopped by a --FLIGHT ATTENDANTI'm sorry, sir. This cabin is
           restricted to first cl...

Mr. Jones now removes a FIRST CLASS TICKET.JAMES EARL JONESIs this what you're looking for?

She looks at it -- a little confused as to why he's just
handing it to her now -- but then she nods. As he passes:FLIGHT ATTENDANTOh, I'm sorry. Please. Is there
           anything I can get you?JAMES EARL JONESScotch, blended. Straight.

He continues into the first class cabin and toward --CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                              2.THE FIRST CLASS EMERGENCY ROOMWhere he slides in past the nervous, shifty-eyed man (his
name is PASQUAL) and sits by the window.

After a moment, Pasqual quietly clears his throat and
leans, slightly, towards Jones.PASQUAL(tentatively)
          They say birds can't fly this high.JAMES EARL JONESThey say only angels can.

Now Pasqual nods. Nervously begins to remove something
from his pocket when they are interrupted by --FLIGHT ATTENDANTShall I pour your scotch?JAMES EARL JONESNo -- I'll take the bottle. Thank you.

She hands him the airplane-sized bottle -- he waves off
the glass. She shrugs, leaving...

Pasqual to resume what he was doing. Slowly, he removes
a roll of Certs. He looks to Jones -- "Well? What about
your end of the bargain?"

From within his dashiki, Jones pulls out a black velvet
pouch. He hands it to Pasqual, who opens it to find
diamonds. A helluva lot of diamonds. Pasqual smiles.

He hands the roll of Certs to Jones. It's not breath
candy at all, but a tiny roll of explosives, with a tiny,
high-tech triggering mechanism.JAMES EARL JONESAh, c-5. The most dangerous
          explosive material ever invented.
          Hard to believe that this little
          contraption could blow up ten city
          blocks.PASQUALBe careful with it, huh?

Both men smile.   Pasqual's very relieved that the deal is
done.

Then suddenly, the lights blink out.

Pasqual looks around, nervous. But it's just the in-
flight movie beginning. Clouds, and a woman holding a
torch.(CONTINUED)CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                              3.CONTINUED:Columbia Pictures presents... David Spade and Adam
Sandler in "BOSOM BUDDIES: THE MOVIE."

James Earl Jones shakes his head, rolls his eyes.JAMES EARL JONESAnother movie from an old TV show?PASQUALWell, what're you gonna do?JAMES EARL JONESWalk out.PASQUALThat's very funny.

But James Earl Jones is dead serious.JAMES EARL JONESNo.   It isn't.

Jones grabs Pascal in a headlock and turns toward the
back of the plane, shouting:JAMES EARL JONES (CONT'D)EVERYONE!   FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELTS!Now Jones does the unthinkable. Holding Pasqual tight,
he yanks open the emergency door release.

With a RUSH, the cabin decompresses.

Panic erupts as air, paper and everything not belted in
screams out of the open door, including --EXT. THE BIG BLUE SKY - FALLING AWAY FROM THE 747 - DAY-- James Earl Jones, still holding Pasqual in a bear hug.
They plummet, wind violently tearing at them. Pasqual's
frantic SCREAMS doppler quite nicely.DROPPING WITH THEMThey continue to fall, gaining speed. Pasqual is
terrified, but Jones doesn't seem worried. In fact,
casually, he glances at his watch, and then looks --FAR BELOW THEM - ACROSS THE SKYAt the tiny black speck gradually grows larger in the
distance...CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               4.CLOSER - ON THAT BLACK SPECKIt's a jet helicopter. Its door opens, and now a SKYDIVER leaps
out, helmet down, arms back, streaking across the
sky in aerodynamic perfection, heading directly towardsJONES AND PASQUALwho are still plummeting toward the earth at terminal
velocity. Jones begins to let go of Pasqual, who SCREAMS
and tries to clutch onto him, desperate.JAMES EARL JONES(over the rushing wind)PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER. WE HAVECOMPANY.PASQUALWHAT?Suddenly -- WHOMMPPPH!! -- the skydiver spread-eagles,
stopping the wild dive directly behind Pasqual, and
immediately binds his arms and straps a parachute on him.

All three are still free-falling.

James Earl Jones nods at the Skydiver who, even under the
helmet and goggles, is clearly a beautiful woman.

Meet ALEXANDRA "ALEX" MUNDAY, one of Charlie's Angels.
She's a sultry bombshell -- a classic femme fatale --
only she's playing for the good guys.

She gives James Earl Jones a wink, then jerks Pasqual's
rip cord and -- WHOOMPH. Pasqual's chute deploys. He
flies upward, leaving --

Alex and James Earl Jones, both still falling.    Below the
ocean screams up at them. Not much time left.

James Earl Jones pulls his belt -- and his mufti flies
up. It's actually a tiny drogue chute, deploying his
entire dashiki. His outfit hides a parachute rig.

Alex pulls her own rip cord and -- WHOOMPH -- her chute
unfurls, and now...

Alex and James Earl Jones gently float towards --EXT. THE BIG BLUE SEA - DAYA cigarette boat floats through the choppy water, a
gorgeous young woman expertly throttling up the growlingV-8.Say hello to NATALIE THOMPSON, Charlie's second angel.
At a glance, she's the brainy-shy girl next door.(CONTINUED)CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 5.CONTINUED:But put her behind the wheel of any vehicle, and she's
unstoppable.

Natalie glances ahead, maneuvering the boat perfectly under
Alex, who drops on deck. Alex gathers her chute, then whips off
her helmet to give her cascading mane a wild shake.

Here comes James Earl Jones. Natalie guns the boat
underneath...a perfect catch. Alex helps him with his
dashiki-chute, and then all three look up...

Here comes Pasqual. Natalie whips the boat around,
catching him as he helplessly drops into the seats, still
bound, still scared out of his wits. He gapes wild-eyed
at the two Angels, then whirls on James Earl Jones.PASQUALYou crazy bastard!JAMES EARL JONESI think you mean crazy bitch.

With that, James Earl Jones reaches up and pulls his face
off. Latex rips free, and standing there (without his
dashiki, James Earl Jones has a great figure) is...

... stunningly beautiful DYLAN SANDERS, angel number
three. She's the wild one.

Pasqual's jaw drops as Dylan shakes her hair free, then
reaches in her mouth --DYLAN(still with James Earl Jones' voice)
             Don't need this anymore.

-- and extracts a voice-modifying chip.DYLAN (CONT'D)(now in her real voice)
             But I sure could use this.

And she pulls from her pocket the airplane-size bottle of
Johnnie Walker Black. She twists it open and downs it.DYLAN (CONT'D)Damn I hate to fly.EXT. BEACH DOCK - DAYNow, MEN IN "FBI" WINDBREAKERS haul Pasqual away, two of
them carefully handling the certs-explosive. A harmless
fellow pushes his way past them and onto the dock.

It's JOHN BOSLEY, Charlie's lieutenant.(CONTINUED)CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 6.CONTINUED:He reaches the boat, which Natalie ties off while Alex
and Dylan neatly fold their parachutes.BOSLEYWell, Angels, the experimental
             explosives are back in the hands of
             the government, and the free world
             can breathe just a lit-tle bit
             easier tonight, thanks to you three.

Alex, Natalie and Dylan stroll from the dock onto the sand,
each starting to unzip/unbutton/unsnap their action gear and
hand it to Bosley as they continue walking.NATALIEAnd thanks to you, too, Bos.ALEXWe couldn't have redirected the
             flight path without your help.

Bosley puffs, proud. He speaks over the ever-growing
pile of chutes, body suits, goggles, the dashiki...BOSLEYNothing a little teamwork can't do.
             At least, that's what Charlie's
             always telling us, right ladies?DYLANCharlie will be joining us, won't he?BOSLEYHe sends his regrets. But he
             wanted you to know that dinner is
             on him, so feel free to celebrate.

By now, the Angels have stripped off all of their
equipment, revealing eye-popping evening gowns.ALEXIf it's on Charlie, we will.

The Angels share a laugh as they arrive in their sassy
duds at a private beach club, where a WAITER greets them
with a tray of champagne flutes.

They each take a glass, turn to each other and raise
them. Another Angels Mystery... Case Closed.

side by side. These are three very different girls.

NATALIE, with a page-boy cut and wearing a Catholic
schoolgirl's uniform, sports glasses and braces; a bit
awkward and gangly, even shy.

ALEX, formally dressed with perfect pig-tails, is
sophisticated and self-possessed; a class act, even at ten.

DYLAN, wild blond hair and faded T-shirt, has a jaded,
street-wise smirk; even at this young age, her isolation
and disillusionment are masked by seeming confidence.CHARLIE (CONT'D)... there were three very
             different little girls.

flaunting it) demonstrates a chess-playing computer
program to a room of impressed advisors.

ALEX, valedictorian at Oxford, passionately delivers her
address to a crowd of rapt students, faculty and parents.

DYLAN, in leather and a helmet, steps off a Harley. She
sees a punk with a mohawk slapping around his girlfriend.

in his shower clogs, which SQUISH with every step. He's wearing
two towels: one around his waist, and a second around his
chest.

As more steam dissipates, we see there    are SEVEN MEN sitting on
the risers. Six are gorgeous, ranging     from Calvin Klein models
to Marlboro Men. Bosley looks around,     taking a keen interest.
Maybe he's checking them out, maybe he    isn't. We just don't
know.

The seventh man is ROGER CORWIN, who we recognize from
the videotape. He's leaning forward, a gold chain
dangling. It's beside him that Bosley takes a seat.

He sets the ice cup -- and the transmitter -- in a
strategic location.

Noticing that none of the other men have towels around
their bosoms, Bosley nervously undoes his, revealing skin
the color of cooked salmon. He fluffs up his sparse chest hair,
then decides to smush it back down.

He tries to make eye contact with Corwin, working way too
hard. Annoyed, Corwin finally looks over.BOSLEYHot in here, isn't it?

Corwin shakes his head, idiot.BOSLEY (CONT'D)Just came here to unwind a little.

The door opens, a rush of steam. ADONIS HIMSELF enters.
Picking a seat behind Bosley, he pulls off his towel as
he passes. We just see a bit of ass, but Bosley is face-
to-face with the babymaker.

One ice chip is not going to do it.    He chugs the rest of
his cup, includingTHE TRANSMITTERwhich BLEEPS.    Corwin and others look over.    What the hell
was that?

The device still in his mouth, Bosley has no choice but to
smile and swallow. His eyes go wide as he chokes it down.

his chest a bit, trying to get the transmitter down.CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               20.INT. PRIVATE MASSAGE ROOM - DAYCorwin walks into a lushly-appointed private massage

Corwin gets under the sheet, on his stomach. The

talks with another suit, and further on, a conservatively-
dressed DYLAN who chats up a group of WALL STREET TYPES.DYLANThe average investor sees technology

What ensues is the fastest, wildest, two chicks and one
guy foot chase you've ever seen. Here are some highlights:

-- Thin Man pulls himself, clumsily, over a chain link
fence. Dylan and Natalie pull an old Jackie Chan trick
and run up the side wall and hop over easily.

-- Thin Man, still on foot, waits for traffic to slow,
then darts across the Harbor Freeway. By the time Dylan
and Natalie get there, traffic is roaring again.
Undeterred, they make their way through, tucking and
rolling under the wheels of a moving semi.

-- Dylan is racing down an alley, when a car comes barrelling
at her. She leaps up onto the hood of the car as it drives
underneath her, a la one of those That's Incredible! stunts.

to an interior thunderstorm. Steam fills the room as an
inch of water grows on the floor.

To the left, Bosley starts playing oommpa OOMMPA oommpa

with a feather in his hat.

Natalie begins to YODEL.

Dylan hands a fancy envelope to the bewildered thug. Thug
Two is approaching from behind, curious what the hell is
going on.

Dylan begins to TALK-SING a song in German about a too-
curious goat and his worried mistress. Even with the pantomime,
we have no idea what's happening. It seems
wholesome, but occasionally one of the girls touches the
other in a weirdly coquettish, oddly sexual way.

canister drops into the flames from above, suddenly
venting a HISSING cloud of halon gas. The fire dies
immediately, the logs covered with a violent frost.INT. THE CHIMNEY - NIGHTAlex doesn't even need a rope. Her feet pressed to the
sooty walls, she expertly slides to the bottom.INT. GREAT ROOM - NIGHTAlex backs out of the fireplace to find a WAITING BAD GUY

against the stone, making a spark.

Rolling, jumping and diving, Alex scurries as Pokerman
slashes and stabs. She ducks behind a chair, which
Pokerman catches with the hook, winging it across the
room.

Backed against the wall, Alex yanks on the heavy
curtains, pulling them down, along with the wooden
curtain rod. A spin, a flourish of velvet and the
curtain rings drop off to leave her with a trusty
quarterstaff.

She goes on the offensive.    Thrust, parry, spin.

But he's a worthy adversary. One good karate kick breaks
her staff in two. She uses both pieces to club him in
the knees, then rolls back to the fireplace.

She grabs the remaining tool: the fireplace tongs.
Pokerman swings. Alex catches his weapon in the tong
scissors, yanking it free with such force the point sticks
in the wall.

A quick kick knocks Pokerman to the floor, where Alex
rolls on top of him. She catches his head in the tongs,
squeezing his temples. His eyes bulge.ALEXWhere's Knox?CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  35.INT. WINDOWLESS ROOM - NIGHTYoung billionaire ERIC KNOX paces. He's grungy, with

Dylan and Natalie's new song has them sharing the saddle
of an imaginary horse. When Dylan reaches back to slap
the "horse," she hits Natalie in the rump. Both women
tee-hee.

The thugs think it's pretty hot.

Dylan whispers a secret to Natalie.     Natalie WHISPERS
back.

Turning to the thugs, they each lean in to WHISPER into
a different thug's ear. As the men smile, the angels
suddenly BONK the two men's heads together. Both men
fall, knocked out.

Stepping over the bodies, Dylan heads inside.INT. MOUNTAIN HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHTLooking for the way out, Alex leads Knox to a closed

piling into jeeps to give chase. From the side of the

The van THUMPS AND BUMPS its way across the low grass,

With that, he walks out of the room.

The Thin Man signals to the Henchmen. Two of them force
Dylan to sit in one of the wooden deck chairs.

to rage.NATALIEYou bitch!   I like that guy.

Mocking, Vivian wipes away a tear.

Natalie lets forth a typhoon of fury, a full-out Mortal
Kombat. Vivian is thrown back against the bookcase,
where she knocks over a candlestick.

That's the trigger for the bookcases to begin sinking
into the floor. Circling around the room, each set of
shelves drops to a different level, forming steps that
lead to the upstairs room.

his head down from above, watching the brawl. Natalie is

And now she does exactly what she told the Thin Man she'd do:

She pitches forward, ducking her head so the chair's back
crashes into the railing, tearing it off. She stands.DYLAN (CONT'D)Okay, that part worked.

The Guards FIRE -- but Dylan has already launched herself
from the railing into that backflip, which lands her on
the head of --

Fat Boy, flattening him bad, and smashing the rest of the
chair into kindling. She grabs the wooden seat and whips
it up, catching bullets from Guard #3 before flinging it
like a Frisbee at Guard #2, nailing him right on the chin.

Quickly she stands again, between Guards #3 and 4.DYLAN (CONT'D)Now, guys, I warned you. This is
             where you shoot each other.

The two men scoff, disbelieving. Then Dylan does a head
fake, both Guards panic, and fire, but Dylan drops, leaving
each man a clear shot at the other. Both gape. Both fall.

Just Guards #5 and 6 left.    Dylan's chair arms are still
taped to her forearms.DYLAN (CONT'D)Okay, here's where we improvise.

chair.

arms are still strapped to the arms of the first chair --
is taped to the chair she now sits in.BOSLEYOh my God, let me help you.

And then, with no warning, he hauls off and punches the

backward, dazed. Then he reaches for his gun, in the

roundhouse kick, knocking the gun out of the Thin Man's
hands. The Thin Man immediately responds, throwing two
quick punches, which Alex expertly blocks and then follows
with a hitch-kick to the chin.

Jason, dazed and confused, thinks he must be hallucinating.JASONWhat the hell is going on?

Whew, that was close. But it'll start up any second.       She
has to keep it stopped. But how? She glances to the
sidelines and gets an idea.ON THE COURT --MUSIC starts from overhead, the respective teams' cheerleaders
coming out for one last routine.

As they kick into gear, Natalie comes out with them, dressed
as a Duke cheerleader. She follows along with the dancers, a
bit timid at first, then more confident as she gets into it.INT. ARENA BASEMENT -- BENEATH THE COURTDylan races through the basement, looking for the briefcase.
Then she spots it, hooked into some wires that snake up
into ceiling above.

her, and she's totally in the moment. But there's another
agenda as well...COURTSIDE RADIO ANNOUNCERThe time out is over, but one

She spins to see Knox, standing behind her.KNOX (CONT'D)See, if you snip ANY of those wires,
          the bomb WILL blow up.DYLANIt's gonna blow anyway, once the
          clock gets to zero.KNOXWho told you that, my idiotic
          henchman? Do you think I tell him
          ANYTHING that's confidential?

He holds up a small TRIGGERING DEVICE. It's the same one
we saw Pascal try to sell in the opening scene.KNOX (CONT'D)THIS is what triggers that bomb.     So
          if you'll kindly step away, I'll

Knox laughs.KNOXGood one.
                 (beat, as he backs up)
          Well, I must be going. If you like
          your body parts attached to your

Knox turns to go, but the other Angels are blocking his way.ALEXGive it up, Knox. You're surrounded.NATALIEGive us the detonator.KNOXNO!Stumbling backwards, Knox holds it up high.KNOX (CONT'D)I'll blow this building sky high, I swear!CHARLIE (O.S.)Don't do it, Eric. It's me you want,

Everyone turns, as one, to a figure emerging from the shadows.KNOXCharlie?

That's right, it's Charlie. Finally, after all these years,
we get a look at him, and boy is it... disappointing.

He's not what we expected. Short, portly, dressed in a
"We're #1" t-shirt; the Angels are absolutely floored by
Charlie's appearance.ANGELSCharlie?

Charlie ignores their stares and addresses Knox directly.(CONTINUED)CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 100.CONTINUED:CHARLIEYour father was a double agent, Eric.

             hate me so much, just shoot ME.
             Just shoot me, Eric.

Charlie spreads his arms, leaving Knox a plenty wide target.

It's a horribly tense moment.       The Angels are frozen, watching
Knox decide Charlie's fate.

Knox is sweating, debating his choices. Can he really do
this? Charlie's not the glamorous, smug asshole he imagined.
He starts lowering his gun.KNOXOkay.  You're right.

             I'll just kill you.BLAM!It all happens in the blink of an eye. Knox fires, hitting
Charlie in the chest. Natalie leaps out and tackles Knox.

to go off.

Dylan runs to Charlie's side.DYLANCharlie, no.   NO!

She hold shim in her arms as the other Angels gather round
their fallen leader. He gasps for air.DYLAN (CONT'D)He's trying to say something.

Then Dylan notices something weird. He's not gasping for
air, there's something stuck in his mouth.

With a great, hacking cough, he spits it out. It's a voice
chip, like the one Dylan used in the opening scene.(CONTINUED)CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                101.CONTINUED:VOICEUcch, that tasted terrible!

The voice isn't Charlie's. Dylan reaches down and rips
off Charlie's mask, revealing...NATALIEBosley!   Are you okay?BOSLEYThink so.

He pulls back the padding from the suit, revealing a small
wound where the bullet grazed his side.BOSLEY (CONT'D)Hurts, but it looks like it'll heel.

Dylan laughs, Alex ruffles his hair.DYLANHey, wait a second. If Bosley's
             here... then where's Charlie?

reflection in the window -- not enough to see his face,
but we get some sense of the man.

He turns away, begins walking.    Steps down onto the sand.CHARLIE(to cell phone)
             I'd love to, Angels. But I have some
             precious treasures to watch over.

move past. Does she somehow recognize it's Charlie?
