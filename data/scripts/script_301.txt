Los Angeles.EXT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - DAYThe armored truck pulls up. An ARMORED TRUCK GUARD emerges
from the back with a satchel and heads inside.INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTIONA large foyer. Security station and elevators. PARTY SOUNDS
can be heard from a second floor balcony.
DOUGLAS is the security guard manning the station. Seeing
the Armored car Guard entering, he picks up the phone and
dials. Beat. Into phone --DOUGLASLast delivery's finally here.
The Armored Truck Guard approaches the security station. As
he and Douglas exchange paperwork, the Armored Truck Guard
references the sounds from upstairs --ARMORED TRUCK GUARDParty?DOUGLASIntroducing a new line of jewelry.ARMORED TRUCK GUARDWife wants me to buy her a ruby ring.
           Told her to spend a little time with
           the family jewels first.
PING. An ELEVATOR opens. A second security guard's inside.
Handing over the satchel and heading out --ARMORED TRUCK GUARDKeep it real.INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTIONWe see the security guard with the satchel use a key-card to
gain elevator access to the lower floors. As the elevator
doors slide closed...3.INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - MOMENTS LATERAn exclusive showroom. Display tables empty. At one end of
the room, the elevator. At the other end, the open door to
a walk-in vault.

The ELEVATOR PINGS, and the doors open. The guard emerges
with the cart. Pushes it across the room to the outside of
the vault.
A man in a suit emerges from the vault and starts unloading
the cart into the vault.INT. SUBWAY STATION - DAYA train arrives.   People jostle on and off.
One man remains on the platform. MILES. Crisp dresser.
Carrying a large leather bag. A cylinder hanging by a strap
over his shoulder.
The train doors begin to close.   When...
A fist inserts itself between the doors. They re-open, and
a man steps onto the platform. TONY FAIT. Well-dressed.
Intense.
Fait joins Miles. They watch the train pull out. They
check to make sure the station's empty. Then jump off the
platform into the tunnel and disappear.INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAYThe man in the suit has finished unloading the cart. He
closes the heavy vault door and spins a large wheel on the
door, securing the vault.INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAYFait and Miles run down the dark tunnel, staying close to
the wall. Miles stumbles. Falls toward the deadly, high-
voltage third rail.
Out of nowhere, Fait's hand grabs Miles' jacket. Stops him.
Just before he hits. Inches from the rail. Fait pulls him
back up and away from the danger.FAITWatch yourself.
Miles nods.4.FAITKeep it tight.
Miles nods again, and they set off.INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - DAYSounds of the PARTY continue from upstairs. At the security
station, the guard, Douglas, looks up from a magazine and
scans the security monitors.ANGLE - SECURITY MONITORSdepicting the empty vault, empty vault anteroom, various
empty store areas and the elevator, in which we see the man
in the suit riding up.BACK TO SCENEDouglas settles back in with his magazine.INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAYFait and Miles reach an access door tagged with paint.    Fait
starts to open it.
Suddenly, the tunnel is filled with the ROAR of an
APPROACHING TRAIN. Fait and Miles leap to the wall.   Press
their backs against it as tightly as they can.
The TRAIN whooms past, inches from their faces. When it's
gone, Miles sighs with relief. Fait cracks the access door.INT. SUBWAY UTILITY TUNNELS - DAYFait moves quickly, Miles following. Fait makes fast lefts
and rights, following more spray paint.
They branch off into a small dirt-floored space, deep in the
sub-foundation of a building. Fait stops. Overhead is a
flat ceiling. On the ceiling, his flashlight finds a spray-
painted circle.FAITBull's-eye.
Without a word, Miles begins assembling equipment.    Fait
pulls out a cell phone.EXT. PARKING GARAGE - (SANTA MONICA) ROOFTOP - DAY5.A man, DUNCAN SU, sits in a rental 2002 Thunderbird.INT. SU'S RENTAL T-BIRD - CONTINUOUS ACTIONSu's focused, intense, listening to a fancy WALKMAN through
HEADPHONES. We hear what he hears. Only there's no music,
just STATIC.
Suddenly, on Su's headphones, a PHONE RINGS. Su grows even
more alert. We hear a man with a French accent answer the
phone.CHRISTOPHE (V.O.)Yes?FAIT (V.O.)We're in position.CHRISTOPHE (V.O.)Delivery confirmed. The stones are
           there.FAIT (V.O.)Not for long.CLICK.   HISS.Su didn't like what he just heard.       Curses in Chinese.   And
takes off.EXT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAYPerched on the side of a cliff above the Pacific, next to
the park. The top floor is at street level.
Su easily gains access to the roof of the building. He
moves to an exact position just at the ocean-side edge. It's
an eight-story drop.
Su faces in.      And then... Hops backward off the roof.
Falling feet-first through the air, Su momentarily grabs
onto an eight-floor balcony rail, slowing his descent, then
lets go.
Momentarily grabs a seventh-floor rail and lets go. Grabs a
sixth-floor rail. Hangs on this time. Vaults lightly onto
the balcony.INT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY6.A large, free-standing FISH TANK BUBBLES away. Nearby,
CHRISTOPHE is packing to leave town. When...SU (0.S.)Where are the stones?

Christophe turns.       Sees Su standing behind him.CHRISTOPHE(French accent)
           Who the fuck are you?
Wham.   The Chinese boxing version of a bitch-slap.SUWho's getting them for you?CHRISTOPHEFuck off.
Wham!   Wham!   Wham!     Wham!   Much more violent than a bitch-
slap.CHRISTOPHEI'll tell you.SUI know.INT. SUB-FOUNDATION - DAYA plasma torch burns through the metal-reinforced slab
overhead. Fait taps Miles, who turns off the torch.
Fait hammers at the last layer. And...INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTIONA hole appears under the private display table, where it
can't be seen by the room's security camera.INT. SUB-FOUNDATION - DAYFait communicates via a high-tech, transmitting/receiving
earwig.FAITDaria.INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - DAYDouglas looks up from his magazine and checks the security
monitors again. Everything a-okay.7.ANGLE - FRONT DOORA limo pulls up outside.EXT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - DAYA uniformed chauffeur gets out of the limo, moves to the
back and opens the door. A very attractive woman in a
short, tight dress emerges.INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - DAYEscorted by the chauffeur, the woman, DARIA, enters. She
approaches the security station. Up close, in the light,
Daria's even more alluring. And knows how to wield it.DARIAI'm here for the reception.DOUGLASName, please?DARIAAngie Rawlins.
Douglas scans a list of names.      Checks off hers.DOUGLASThank you. You can go on up.       Front
          elevator, to the mezzanine.
Daria turns toward the elevator. Then doesn't go. Just
glances up toward the party, suddenly unenthusiastic.DARIA... I hate these things.      Don't you
          hate these things?DOUGLASI'm just here to do my job.
Daria looks back at Douglas.      Studies him a moment.   Liking
what she sees.DARIAThen again, you never know who you're
          going to meet...
She shifts her wrap, baring cleavage.      Then leans over the
desk. Giving Douglas an eyeful.DARIA8.I'll bet you're a lot more fun than
          any of those boring people upstairs.
Douglas is unaffected.   Just looks at her blankly.DOUGLASReally, ma'am.   I have a job to do.
Daria doesn't understand why he's not interested in her.
Then she glimpses Douglas's magazine lying on the desk.DARIA'S POVThe magazine is Genre.   Males for males.   Buff boys.   Big
pecs, big penises.BACK TO SCENEDaria steps back.DARIAWell, I suppose I should go up and
          see what they're selling.
Daria turns back and calls to her chauffeur, TOMMY.DARIATommy...
What happens next happens very quickly and sotto voce, as
Daria walks toward Tommy:
She whispers into a hidden mike --DARIAChange of plans. He's gay.
Tommy hears it over his earwig.TOMMYNo way.DARIAYeah way.INTERCUT WITH:INT. SUB-FOUNDATION - DAYFait and Miles have heard it, too.   Into his mike --FAITTommy.    Your turn.9.A look of alarm on Tommy's face.    Into his mike --TOMMYUh-uh.FAITThis isn't a conversation.    Do it.
It's an order.    Tommy knows he has to.   Shit.TOMMYShit.DARIAKey-card.

Then, still to Tommy, her voice again at normal volume --DARIAWhy don't you keep my purse?     I
          shouldn't be too long.
Daria hands Tommy her purse. Palms the key-card from him.
Then heads toward the elevator, as...
Tommy replaces the sick look on his face. Does his best to
look flirty as he walks over to the security station. Leans
over the desk with a yummy-smile on his face.TOMMY... Aloha.
(NOTE: The following scene is INTERCUT with Scenes 20
 thru 28.)
Douglas looks up from his magazine.DOUGLASHi.TOMMYI hope you don't take offense at
          this... but I just have such a
          weakness for a man in uniform.DOUGLASIf that's your thing...TOMMYUniform's definitely my thing. I
          mean, I see a sailor, I'm thinking,
          mmm, seafood. Y'know?DOUGLASI'm not actually supposed to be10.talking on duty.TOMMYWho's talking? Honey, this is a
          flirting... But you're probably just
          another good-looking man wasting it
          all on women. World's full of fools.
Beat.   Douglas lets him see the Genre magazine.TOMMYYahtzee!... Okay, Mr. I-Always-Have-
          A-Hard-Nightstick. Put away the
          pictures of those underfed, white
          males and let's broaden your
          horizons.TOMMY (CONT'D)I like sunsets and puppy dogs, and
          I'm big in the pants. Just hope I'm
          not too cute for you. And don't tell
          me it's a color thing, hon, or I'll
          come over there and slap a little
          discrimination right upside your
          yummy little cheeks.DOUGLASI'm hooked up.TOMMYAnother big, hot, cuddly, black love-
          Jesus got there first. That bitch.
          Taking you. From me.DOUGLASSorry.TOMMYHey... This day and age, sweetie, I
          can appreciate the monogamy. Saving
          it for your number one is keeping the
          world safe, and it's okay by me.
          Even if you are just breaking my
          heart... Guess I'll just have to come
          in here someday, let you catch me
          shoplifting and resist arrest -- just
          to have you wrestle me down and cuff
          me.DOUGLASI can be pretty rough.TOMMYDon't you get me all excited now.   I
          was just learning to accept my
          disappointment.11.Tommy sticks out his hand.TOMMYTommy.     But you can call me Rachel.

Shaking hands --DOUGLASDouglas. And, man, I really gotta
          get back to what I'm supposed to be
          doing, okay?
He looks away.     Scans the monitors.ANGLE - MONITORSEverything looks normal.ANGLE BACK ON TOMMY AND DOUGLASSeeing Douglas is unaware of what's happening in the vault,
Tommy relaxes.TOMMYI'll leave you alone. But is it okay
          if I just stand here and stare at the
          muscles I'll be missing for the rest
          of my
          life?
OFF which...INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTIONDaria gets in. Looks back to make sure Tommy has Douglas's
attention. He does.
Instead of going up, Daria uses the key-card to access the
controls to go down.ANOTHER ANGLEAs the doors close, Daria shoots a wink back at...TOMMYwho furtively flips her the bird.        Never missing a beat with
Douglas.12.INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAYFait emerges from the hole beneath the table.INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAYOn the monitors, we see Fait in the vault anteroom and Daria
descending in the elevator as Tommy keeps Douglas's
attention diverted.INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAYFait holds a small digital camera next to the room's
security camera. Mimicking the security camera's slow pan,
Fait films the room. When he's done....CLOSEUP - FAIT'S DIGITAL CAMERAWe see the panning shot of the room on the monitor. Fait
pulls up an on-screen menu, clicks on "Repeat." Whereupon
the mini-movie begins playing in a continuous loop.INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAYAs Fait mounts his camera in front of the security camera,
Daria steps off the elevator, putting her hair up, ready to
work.INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAYOn the anteroom monitor, we see the monitor on Fait's camera
slide into position, making the room look empty, as Tommy
continues diverting Douglas's attention.INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAYFait and Daria push the display table aside as Miles shoves
equipment bags through the hole in the floor.
Fait opens the leather bag, revealing tools, a tripod, three
steel cables and a long, rectangular box. Miles grabs a
high-tech DRILL. Begins BORING a hole high up on the vault
door.
Fait hands Daria the tripod to set up, while he uncoils the
steel cables, attaches them to the wheel on the vault door.
Then opens the rectangular box and lifts out what's inside.
A surface-to-air missile. Fait sets it on the tripod.13.Miles, the hole drilled, picks up the cylinder he'd had
slung over his shoulder. Pulls out a pressurized metal
canister of liquid nitrogen.
Miles injects the nitrogen into the hole. A CRACKLING sound
as the super-low-temp LIQUID spreads out inside the vault
door. The outside frosts over.
Fait finishes attaching the free ends of the cables to clips
on the SAM. Final checks of the rig.FAITOut.INT. SU'S RENTAL T-BIRD - DAYSpeeding through L.A.   Calling 911 on a cell phone.SU... I want to report a crime in

Fait pulls out a remote control firing device.   He pushes
the button. And...INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAYThe SAM IGNITES with a blinding flash and streaks across the
room. The steel cables instantly snap taut and... RIP the
vault's wheel and frozen locking mechanism right the fuck
out of the door.INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAYThey felt a rumble.   Tommy covers --TOMMYEarthquake.14.Douglas checks the monitors.      Everything looks okay.TOMMYBet you know how to hit a ten on the

in pieces and a hole the size of a Sub Zero where the SAM
augured into the opposite wall.DARIAHoly shit...

Fait's already swinging open the vault.FAITThis will trigger the silent alarm.
          Let's go. We got eleven minutes.
Miles moves down the rows of   drawers, using a tool to pop
all the locks. Fait and Daria   follow behind, quickly pulling
out the drawers and emptying   jewels into nylon bags. Fait
empties drawer after drawer.    All white diamonds. When...
He opens a drawer containing various colored diamonds.     And
stops, admiring them.FAIT... I love colored stones... Look at
          this...
He holds up a small, faceted blue diamond.FAITTwo-point-seven million.
Into the bag.MILESWhose shit we stealing, anyway?FAITDrug dealers and money launderers.DARIAWorks for me.
Then something else catches his eye. He holds up a small,
pink diamond on a chain. Admires it.FAITThis I can use.15.And pockets it.DARIAT.Fait moves to her. Daria's fishing into a nylon bag she
found in a drawer. Pulls out a handful of... Large black
diamonds. Many more in the bag.FAITPow.
He takes the bag. Stows it in his jacket. When...
Suddenly, Fait's CELL PHONE RINGS. Surprising them.   Beat.
Fait answers.FAITGo.INTERCUT WITH:INT. SU'S RENTAL T-BIRD - DAYSu's speeding through Los Angeles streets.SUYour employer betrayed you. The
          police are on the way. Leave the

Fait just hangs up.INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAYTommy and Douglas hear APPROACHING SIRENS. The SIRENS STOP
outside. SWAT, cops, the works. All heading for the front
door. Tommy whispers urgently into his mike.TOMMYShit.  Five-0 at the do'.

helps another up to check the top of the train. The SECOND
COP jumps back down.SWAT COP #2All clear.ANGLE BACKFait turns back to Daria. Signals her to climb up onto the
top of the train. Then begins climbing after her.
As Fait reaches the driver's window, he sees ANOTHER SWAT
COP approaching the train's DRIVER, checking under seats,
etc.
Fait has to climb fast. The SWAT Guy and the Driver getting
closer. Looking up. Just as...INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - THEIR POV - CONTINUOUS ACTIONFait's leg just clears the window.      They don't see it.

During which, just above them...
Fait and Daria lie very still. Daria's tense. Fait winks at
her, trying to relax her. Daria's still tense. He raises his
eyebrows slightly. Shifts his gaze down.
She doesn't get it. Finally follows his gaze. Sees her
position is giving him a full view of her cleavage. She
looks back at him in disbelief.FAITNice.
That does it. She relaxes and smiles back. Under which a
voice crackles over the SWAT Cop's radio.RADIO (V.O.)All clear.SWAT COP #4(to Driver)
          Okay.    Get this train outta here.
Whereupon the train jerks to a start.INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - MILES - DAYrunning toward the rear of the stopped train.   Leaping onto
the rear steps. When...
Out of nowhere, a foot catches him in the head, sending him
flying back down onto the rails. And... There is Su in
front of him.19.SUThe stones.MILESYou'll have to come and get 'em.

Su moves on Miles. Miles throws a solid punch at him. Su
and Miles fight on the track behind the stopped train. The
deadly third rail making the fight even more dangerous.
Miles is a street boxer. He's good. He's ferocious. But
he's no match for Su. When Miles is subdued, Su grabs the
bag of jewels, makes sure Miles doesn't have any more, then
goes.INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - SUBWAY CAR ROOF - DAYRocketing underground. The tunnel ceiling whizzes by above
Fait and Daria. Intermittent tunnel fixtures just inches
from their heads.
Every time the train takes a curve, they both slide toward
the edge. Fait places a calming hand on top of Daria's. The
car takes a wide curve.
Daria's body flips to the side. She loses her grip.
Screams as she starts to fall off the train. Fait reaches
for Daria, losing his grip on his bag, which plummets off
the train.
Fait can't grab her. The train jerks again. He starts
sliding away from her, off the opposite side. Fait thrusts
out both hands as far as he can. And...
Just snags her at the last second. Grips Daria's wrists
with all he's got. They're now draped across the curved roof
of the train. Hands in the middle. If Daria slips, or Fait
lets her go, they both die.INT. RENTAL T-BIRD (OUTSIDE SUBWAY ENTRANCE) - DAYSu gets in. Empties Miles' nylon bag into his lap. A
fortune in gems and jewelry pours out. Su sifts through it,
increasingly agitated. What he wants isn't there. He throws
the bag down, cursing in Chinese.INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - SUBWAY CAR ROOF - DAYFait is at his limit. His grip starts to loosen. When the
train begins to slow. They pull into a station and stop.
Fait releases Daria, and she drops to the platform.20.Fait jumps down on the other side. He's lost the bag of
jewels. Knows they're gone for good. He feels for the bag
of black diamonds. Still has them.
Unseen, Fait joins Daria on the platform, and, hand in hand,
they melt into the crowd of commuters.EXT. AIRPORT - GENERAL AVIATION TERMINAL - DUSKA stretch limo and a Cadillac Escalade wait on the tarmac
next to a Gulfstream, which has just arrived.
The jet door opens, and a man emerges with a bodyguard. The
man, LING, is Asian, about forty. Emanates grace and power.
As Ling descends the steps, and two thugs from the SUV go to
retrieve baggage...
A woman steps out of the waiting limo to greet Ling.   She's
also Asian. Dressed in American casual. Beautiful.     SONA.
She's not smiling. As Ling approaches her --LINGEnjoying California?
CHARLES, the bodyguard, answers for himself.CHARLESHope we're not here long.    I hate
          sunshine.
Ling kisses Sona on the lips.    Then --SONAWe may have a problem.
Ling's mood quickly darkens.LINGThe stones?SONAThe exchange was just robbed.LING... Let's hope that was part of the
          plan.INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - VAULT ANTEROOM - DAYSwarming with police. When... Su steps off the elevator.

Su flashes I.D. We don't see it.   The Cop scopes it a
moment. He's clearly impressed.COPFollow me.
As he leads Su toward his superiors in the vault...INT. VANESSA'S BEDROOM - NIGHTVANESSA, eight, is in her pajamas, playing SIM Coaster on
her computer. The door opens. Fait enters. His daughter.FAITYou know it's past your bedtime.VANESSAJust a little longer.FAIT(imitating sweetly)
          'Just a little longer'... School
          tomorrow, baby. Let's go.
Vanessa sighs. Fait stands over her as she shuts down the
computer, talking her through the commands, making sure she
doesn't dawdle.FAIT'Exit.' 'Quit.' 'Do not save.'
          'Special.' 'Shut down.' Sleepy-
          time.

around the room and tucks her into bed.FAITYou bag some Z's now, you hear?VANESSAOkay.FAIT... Wait a second.VANESSAWhat?FAITI think there's something behind your22.ear.VANESSAOh, please, that is so lame.     It's in
          your hand.

She takes his right hand, opens it and turns it over.
Nothing. Takes his left hand, opens it and turns it over.
More nothing. She's stumped.
Fait smiles. Puts his hands together. When he opens them,
there is the pink diamond pendant on the chain.VANESSAHow'd you do that?

Fait slips the chain over her head and kisses her.FAITGood night.
Then Fait looks up.     Addresses the air above her.FAITAngels east, angels west, north and
          south, do your best. Guard her,
          watch her, while she rests.
A bedtime ritual. Fait goes. When she's alone, Vanessa
holds up the diamond, which catches every bit of available
light and shines in the dark.
Then she rolls over and closes her eyes.INT. FAIT'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHTFait enters.     Vanessa's nanny, TONITA, is there.    To Tonita--FAITShe'll stay down now.TONITAShe won't listen to me lately.     Only

and falls    in beside him. Fait throttles back. Keeps
driving.     Until, finally... The cops turn off. And now...
Fait hits    it. Until...
Traffic ahead forces Fait to turn into an alley in a semi-
industrial area. Behind him, the Escalade tries to follow,
but is cut off by the on-coming cars.

them: Ling's two thugs. We barely have time to realize
that Fait's escape has been blocked by construction
equipment down the alley. He's had no choice but to turn
and fight.

Which is what he does, rushing the passenger.
The battle's ferocious and fast. Ultimately, Fait's out-
muscled and out-gunned. He's forced back against the open
door of the Escalade, guns to his head.LING THUG #1Give us the stones.FAITMan, how many times I gotta tell

tries to reach the gun behind the chain-link fence. Almost
gets it. When...
Two vicious DOBERMANS, guard dogs for the junkyard behind
the fence, leap out of nowhere, SNARLING and SNAPPING and
smash into the fence. The killer jumps back, barely
escaping with his arm.
The fight continues.   Fait and Su wear them down.
Behind the fence, the Dobies want flesh. Every time someone
crashes into the fence, they're right there trying to get a
piece.
Also, every time someone crashes into the old fence, we see
a series of chain-link connections loosen and break. Until
it happens one too many times. The entire fence goes down.
The dogs are out. The nearest targets: Su and Fait.Su and
Fait must now focus their attention on fighting off and
evading the ferocious attack dogs.
Finally, Su kicks one dog flying. Whip-kicks the other off
Fait. The two men run for the Escalade. The dogs are up in a
flash. Su spots an abandoned car. A rear door is open.SUOver here.
Fait follows, right on his heels.
The dogs close in.
Su reaches the car. Dives through the open door.
Somersaults over the rear seat. Kicks open the far door and
rolls out. Fait dives in right behind him. The Dobies leap
in after Fait.
Fait's airborne completely through the back seat and out the
other side of the car. Clears the door. And... Su slams
the door shut.
We watch a two-Doberman pile-up against the suddenly closed
door as Su leaps to the car's other side and shuts that
door, too. Trapping the SNARLING, foaming DOGS inside.

When suddenly...
KA-WHAM! Archie's Abrams TANK BLASTS through a wall and
into the hangar.
Archie's head pops out of the driver's hole. At the same
time, Tommy pops up out of the turret and trains a mounted
machine gun on the stunned group.TOMMYFreeze, motherfuckers!87.Russell watches the advancing tank.RUSSELLI knew it!   I knew it!ANGLE - BEHIND TANKFait and Daria enter through the hole in the wall using the

its slow approach. Archie's not a great driver. Tommy
sweeps the muzzle of the machine gun across the group.TOMMYJust be cool!
At which point, Russell breaks for his five-ton truck.89.TOMMYI said don't move, motherfucker!
Russell just keeps going. Slides open the side door in the
back of the five-ton, revealing... A twin-fifty machine gun.
Two barrels, .50 caliber. Dangerous even for a tank.
Russell vaults in and takes aim.RUSSELLFucking amateurs!
He starts FIRING. People start running. .50 CAL. ROUNDS take
big CHUNKS out of whatever they hit.TOMMYShit!   What do we do?ARCHIEShoot back!TOMMYHow?
The question's answered for him.   He somehow does the right
thing. And...
Tommy's MACHINE GUN begins RIPPING CHUNKS out of the FIVE-
TON and EVERYTHING near it. Tommy's a horrible shot; the
gun's more in control of him. But...
Russell finally dies under a HAIL of HEAVY LEAD.ARCHIETwin .50's some major firepower.

INTERCUT WITH which...ACROSS HANGARLing and Sona are moving toward the limo. Ling has the
stones. When... Su is there. Blocking the way. Sona
attacks. Su easily blocks the counters. Knocking Sona back.
Never taking his eyes off Ling. When...
Sona, who's fallen back against a buyer's bodyguard, quickly
takes the bodyguard's small, full-auto SCORPION and turns
the gun on Su.
Su dives for cover as the BURST SHREDS the AREA where he'd
just been standing. As Sona continues hunting Su... Su sees90.Ling getting into the limo.    To Archie and   Tommy, as he
signals --SUDon't let him get away!

As a result of which...TOMMY AND ARCHIEHaving just waxed Russell, see Ling in the limo. Tommy's .50
is out of ammo. He switches to the .30 cal. tank's machine
gun. As Archie steers toward the limo, Tommy begins BLASTING
away.LIMOLing's trying to drive out, when the .30 CAL. SLUGS PUNCH
HOLES in the LIMO. The tank keeps coming. Ling bails out as
the TANK CRUSHES the LIMO.
INTERCUT WITH which...SU AND SONAPlay cat and mouse. Su rapidly runs out of room to hide.
He can't get away. Su stands. Faces her. Faces the
inevitable. When...
WHAM! Daria appears from nowhere. Kicks the gun from
Sona's hand. To Su, re: Ling, now running from the crushed
limoDARIAGet him.
Su goes after Ling.
And now it's Daria vs. Sona.
Sona's a better fighter, but Daria's got passion on her
side. It's a good fight. Until, at last, Sona finds the
Scorpion. She swings it up. And...
Daria executes a sudden, improvised double move that strikes
Sona's arm in such a way as to cause her to point the
SCORPION at herself, just as she FIRES. The burst rips
through her chest and kills her.
And now, here's what's been going on outside...EXT. AIRFIELD91.As Charles runs from the hangar, chasing Vanessa across the
tarmac into the darkness of the airfield...MILESflips to NIGHT VISION on the sniper-scope.    And...SNIPER-SCOPE POV - NIGHT VISIONCharles and Vanessa become clearly visible. Charles is

sign of her. Until...
Charles notices the door to the gas truck isn't closed all
the way. He whips it open. And...
There's Vanessa, hiding inside.
Charles grabs her.   Yanks her out struggling and kicking.CHARLESTime to end this my way.
And then...FAIT (O.S.)Drop the girl.92.Charles looks over.    Fait is there, holding a gun on him.
Vanessa's relieved and excited to see her father.FAITPut her down.
Charles lowers Vanessa to the ground.    He releases her.VANESSADaddy!
Vanessa runs to her father. Dives into his arms. It's a
little more energetic than Fait was expecting. And...

Suddenly, Charles uses the distraction to rush in behind
her. He hits Fait hard. A kick sends the gun flying.
Charles keeps coming. Charles keeps pounding.
Fait's hampered by Vanessa. She won't let him go. Fait
stays between Charles and Vanessa. Guarding his little
girl. Barely managing to fend off Charles, a seemingly
unstoppable force.
The fight winds through the planes, under wings, through
struts.SNIPER-SCOPE POV - NIGHT VISIONFait, Charles and Vanessa.    No clear shot.MILEScomms Fait.MILESNo shot.FAIT, CHARLES AND VANESSAThe fight continues.   Fait's suffering under Charles' brutal
attack. When...
Vanessa causes Fait to stumble near a plane.   They fall.
Charles moves in. And...
Fait's hand goes to a set of chocks set against the plane's
wheel. The chocks are two heavy wooden blocks connected by
a length of nylon rope.
Fait turns to Vanessa.93.FAITDon't move.
Fait jumps to his feet. Swinging the chocks. Not quite
like nunchakus; more like a medieval mace. And now, all of
Fait's fury comes pouring out as he uses the chocks to beat
the living shit out of Charles. Charles tries to fight
back, but he's out-matched by the chocks and Fait's emotion.
The punishing blows land like Thor's hammer. Until...
A mighty swing nearly takes Charles' head off. Charles is
unconscious before he hits the ground. Fait stands over
Charles. Tosses the chocks down.FAITWrong kid.    Wrong dad.

Fait turns. He moves back to where Vanessa's still hiding.
He scoops her up. And... Father and daughter hold each
other tight. Forever. During all of which, also INTERCUT...EXT. HANGARLing, having just escaped being crushed in the limo, runs
out just as... Four helicopters take off, one after the
other, carrying the buyers away.
The fifth chopper, an AGUSTA A109, is POWERED UP, waiting
for the wheelchair-bound French Buyer, being helped by a
bodyguard.
Ling intercepts them. Knocks out the bodyguard and tips
over the Frenchman's chair. Then jumps into the Agusta.INT. AGUSTA - COCKPITLing puts a gun to the pilot's head.LINGGo!EXT. HANGARSu, having left Daria to fight Sona inside, runs out.EXT. AIRFIELDThe Agusta begins to lift off. Su starts running toward the

And then... Su lets go.      Drops fifteen feet to the ground.
As...
Behind him, having clanked out of the hangar, the Abrams
tank is stopped. The turret swivels toward the Agusta.INT. TANKArchie aims the cannon.TOMMYCan you hit it?ARCHIENo problem.   Absolutely... Load.

crashing.EXT. AIRFIELDThe out-of-control AGUSTA swings back toward Su and the
hangar, losing altitude. Then SMASHES into the tarmac,
ripping open the fuel tank, spilling fuel behind it as it
caroms off the hangar and inscribes a large, skidding circle
around Su before CRASHING into another CHOPPER and BURSTINGINTO FLAMES.The spilled fuel ignites.    A circle of intense fire.   With
Su in the middle.
The Agusta pilot, still alive, has been thrown outside the
circle. But Ling's only path of escape takes him inside.
Into the circle. He emerges with the bag of stones.
Su is waiting.LING96.You were lucky last time.   You
          Won't be lucky again.
The final fight begins.
The two martial arts masters battle in the circle of fire,
using everything they can lay their hands on. Each the
equal of the other. Each knowing it's a fight to the death.
For a long time, the fight could go either way. Until...
Ling gets an arm around Su's neck. Like Charles, Su thrashes
and flails. Like Charles, he can't get away.LINGI'll kill you fast.    You won't
          Feel a thing.SU... I won't.    You will
What happens next happens in an instant:
Su breaks the hold. Hooks one of Ling's arms.   Wrenches it.
A direction it can't go.
Ling's ARM BONES SNAP, TISSUES RIP.
Ling screams in pain. Just as... Su pulls the ceramic
Capsule containing the activated sliver of stone from
Ling's pocket. And...
Slams the capsule deep into Ling's open mouth. Ling gags,
choking on the capsule lodged in his throat. His horror-
stricken eyes meet Su's. Su lets him suffer another moment.
Then, in SUBTITLED Chinese --SUThis is for our friends.
And Su strikes him in the throat. A spearing, open-hand
blow with his fingertips. Hard. Hard enough that...INSIDE LING'S THROATThe CERAMIC CAPSULE SHATTERS. Releasing the hot, glowing
white sliver of stone into Ling's windpipe. The fragment's
super high-energy radiation instantly beginning to cook
Ling's body from within. The power of a few thousand
microwave ovens turned on all at once.
Ling's bodily fluids instantly start boiling dry as...ANGLE BACK ON LING97.As, light beaming from his eyes and mouth, Ling flash-cooks
from the inside out.
Not simply burned. Horribly desiccated. His seared and
darkened skin shrink-wrapped, mummy-like, around his
skeleton. Human jerky.
In a moment, it's finished. Ling's dry-roasted remains
topple over. Su has closed a chapter.SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATERSu and Fait meet on the tarmac. Su has the stones. Fait's
