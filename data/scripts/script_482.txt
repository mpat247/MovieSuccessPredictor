PAN DOWN below Maude's waist to reveal that she's turning into a chicken
from the feet up.  First her shoes RIP apart as large, yellow chicken feet
sprout.  Then her dress SWELLS and SPLITS, revealing a large, feathered

foot scratches the floor.MAUDE-CHICKEN (VO)(more CLUCKS)WIDER ANGLE -- FULLSHOT OF MAUDE-CHICKENNow completely transformed and six feet tall, she leaps up to perch on
