                                      July 15, 1991FADE IN:EXT. A SENTRY TOWER ---- in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere.

               Small beams of light coming from lamps attached to the tower 
               cut through the ground mist. We HEAR all the unidentifiable 
               sounds of night in the woods. We also HEAR, very, very 
               faintly, a slow, deliberate drum cadence. And as this starts, 
               we begin to MOVE SLOWLY UP THE TOWER, more becomes visible 
               now:... the sandbags on the ground piled ten-high... the 
               steel, fire escape-type stairway wrapping around the structure 
               and leading to the lookout post, and finally... THE LOOKOUT 
               POST, maybe forty feet off the ground.

               Standing the post is the silhouette of A MARINE. He's holding 
               a rifle and staring straight out.

               The drum cadence has been building slightly.CUT TO:A WIDER SHOT OF THE FENCELINE. And we see by the moonlight 
               that the tall wire-mesh fence winds its way far, far into 
               the distance.SUBTITLE: UNITED STATES NAVAL BASE GUANTANAMO BAY - CUBA.The drum cadence continues, and weCUT TO:INT. A MARINE BARRACKSWe HEAR two pairs of footsteps and thenCUT TO:THE BARRACKS CORRIDORwhere we see that the footsteps belong to DAWSON and DOWNEY, 
               two young marines who we'll get to know later. They stop 
               when they get to a certain door. The drum cadence is still 
               growing. DAWSON puts his hand on the doorknob and turns it 
               slowly.  He opens's the door and they walk intoINT. SANTIAGO'S ROOM - NIGHTWILLY SANTIAGO, a young, very slight marine, lies asleep in 
               his bunk.

               DAWSON kneels down by the bed, puts his hand on SANTIAGO'S 
               shoulder and shakes him gently. SANTIAGO opens his yes, looks 
               at DAWSON, and for a moment there's nothing wrong --

               -- and then SANTIAGO's eyes fill with terror. He lunges out 
               of the bed -- but forget about it. In one flash DAWSON and 
               DOWNEY grab him out of bed, and before the scream can come 
               out, DOWNEY's shoved a piece of cloth into SANTIAGO's mouth.

               Everything that happens next occurs with speed, precision 
               and professionalism.

               Fidelis and it's coming from THE U.S. MARINE CORPS BAND, a 
               sight to behold in their red and gold uniforms and polished 
               silver and brass.

               The BAND is performing on the huge and lush parade grounds 
               before a crowd made up mostly of TOURISTS and DAY-CAMPERS.

               As the TITLES ROLL, we watch the BAND do their thing from 
               various angles. Incredible precision is the name of the game.

               The WOMAN is JOANNE GALLOWAY, a navy lawyer in her early 
               30's. She's bright, attractive, impulsive, and has a tendency 
               to speak quickly. If she had any friends, they'd call her 
               JO. As she walks, she mutters to herself ...JOI'm requesting... I'm... Captain,

                         Two marines, Corporal Harold Dawson 
                         and Private Louden Downey, entered 
                         the barracks room of a PFC William 
                         Santiago and assaulted him. Santiago 
                         died at the base hospital 
                         approximately an hour later. The NIS 
                         agent who took their statements 
                         maintains they were trying to prevent 
                         Santiago from naming them in a 
                         fenceline shooting incident. They're 
                         scheduled to have a hearing down in

                         poster marines and Santiago was known 
                         to be a screw-up. I was thinking 
                         that it sounded an awful lot like a

                         skill, but a familiarity with the 
                         inner workings of the military. In

               KAFFEE's in his late 20's, 15 months out of Harvard Law 
               School, and a brilliant legal mind waiting for a courageous

                         midnight on August 6th, the defendants 
                         went into the barracks room of their 
                         platoon-mate, PFC William Santiago.  
                         They woke him up, tied his arms and 
                         legs with rope, and forced a rag 
                         into his throat. A few minutes later, 
                         a chemical reaction in Santiago's 
                         body called lactic acidosis caused 
                         his lungs to begin bleeding. He 
                         drowned in his own blood and was

                         you he was getting on a plane in six
