                         in front of DeLancey.

               The figure is CAPTAIN JOHN MILLER.  Early thirties.  By far
               the oldest man on the craft.  Relaxed, battle-hardened,
               powerful, ignoring the hell around them.  He smiles, puts a
               cigar in his mouth, strikes a match on the front of DeLancey's
               helmet and lights the cigar.

               DeLancey tries to look away but Miller grips him by the jaw
               and forces him to lock eyes.  Miller smiles.  DeLancey is
               terrified.

               Delancey Captain, are we all gonna die?

               Miller Hell no, two-thirds, tops.

               not going to get a scratch.  A few, including DeLancey, manage
               thin smiles.  Miller releases his grip on DeLancey who moves
               his jaw as if to see if it's broken.  Miller pats him on the

               MILLER motions to WADE, a small, wide-eyed, demolition man
               who's struggling under the weight of half-a dozen satchel
               charges.MILLEROkay, Wade, your turn.

               the first of three bunkers.  Dodging bullets from inside.

                         covered.

               Sarge shakes his head at Miller, then he looks over the cliff
               at the scores of men, their shattered, burning bodies covering
               the rocks and the beach below.  He's clearly affected.

               Miller coldly glances at the dead and wounded.  Then he moves
               on, leading his surviving men toward the two remaining German
               bunkers.  The SOUNDS OF BIG GUNS and MACHINE GUNS FIRE
               surround him.  DISSOLVE TO:EXT. WAR DEPARTMENT BUILDING - DAYThe SOUND OF CLATTERING MACHINE GUN FIRE SEGUES TO that of

                         what he's looking for.  Rises from

               walls and tables are covered with maps of Normandy and complex
               deployment charts.  A ONE-ARMED COLONEL with a chest full of
               ribbons pours himself another cup of coffee.  He clearly
               hasn't slept in a long time.  The Young Captain, his staff
               officer, walks in.

               about.

               One-armed colonel Yes?

               Young captain Two brothers died in Normandy.  One at Omaha
               Beach, the other at Utah.  Last week in Guam a third brother
               was killed in action.  All three telegrams went out this
               morning.  Their mother in Iowa is getting all three telegrams
               this afternoon.

               The life drains from the Colonel.  Others in the room hear
               and freeze.

               One-armed colonel Oh, Jesus.

               Young captain There's more.  There's a fourth brother.  The
               youngest.  He parachuted in with the Hundred-and-First

               nerds the day before finals.  They're breaking down and
               gridding field maps and covering them in plasticine.  Tedious,
               detailed work.

               One of them is TIM UPHAM, a thin, twenty-four year old,
               patrician with gentle, thoughtful eyes behind his thick
               glasses.  He nervously jumps at the sound of a VERY DISTANT
               EXPLOSION, then he forces himself to concentrate on his work.
               Miller strides in.  Miller I'm looking for Corporal Upham.

               Upham raises his eyes from his map and re-focuses.

                         we're going to Ramelle.

               Upham knows enough geography to know what that means.

               Miller looks at him closely, not sure if he's joking.

               Upham I'm writing a book and I...

               Miller's expression gives him his answer.

               others in the back of the jeep.  As they drive off, the CAMERA
               CRANES UP to reveal the vast tableau of the biggest invasion
               in military history.

               The scope of the operation is stunning.  The beach is covered
               with mountains of supplies.  A steady stream of vehicles
               winds up the dunes.  Hundreds of barrage balloons, anchored
               by heavy steel cables, hover over the entire scene.  Off-
               shore, a massive Mulberry port is under construction, workers
               swarming over it like ants.  Beyond that, thousands of ships
               and boats of every type and description.  The smoke of
               hundreds of fires rises on the horizon.  EXPLOSIONS, some
               distant, some close, BOOM and RUMBLE.

               It's an awesome, breathtaking sight.  Miller and his tiny
               band of men, weave their way through the middle of it,
               speeding away from the beach, heading inland, leaving the
               bulk of the American Army behind.  Ext. french road - day
               Miller and his men drive fast passing American vehicles and
               infantrymen moving forward.  The sides of the road are
               littered with the debris of burning German vehicles, abandoned
               equipment, bodies.

               Sarge drives.  Miller reads a map.  Upham, cradling a pristine
               M-1 rifle, is all eyes and ears.  Jackson and Wade calmly
               take in the view.  Reiben checks out the close quarters in
               the back of the jeep.REIBENCaptain, can I ask you a question?MILLERSure, Reiben.REIBENWhere are you planning on putting
                         Private Ryan, sir?

                         that's an order.  He speaks French

               Captain hamill Fundamentals, short runs, double up at the
               corners, one man close, one man wide.  Be careful.  Go.

               The squad takes off.  Captain Hamill sees Miller.  The two
               captains glance at the bars on their shoulders, then speak
               familiarly.

               Captain hamill How was the road in?MILLERWe had a jeep until a few hours ago,
                         a nice one, it had a cute little
                         flag with a couple of stars on it.

               Captain hamill Oh, what a shame.

               One by one, Miller's men join them in the alley.MILLERWe called in a strike on the eighty-
                         eights that took it out, but it's

                         wherever the hell that bastard is.

               Captain Hamill points across a wide field toward a distant
               chateau that has a private chapel with a fifty-foot steeple.

               Captain hamill That's where your boy is.  We've been trying
               to get him since this morning.  He killed two of my men trying
               to get close enough for a shot.  Miller eyes the distant
               steeple.MILLERJackson.

               Jackson steps up.  Miller points to the steeple.  Jackson
               knows what he's supposed to do.  He puts down his M-1 and
               takes off the long, zippered, leather sheath, strapped to
               his back.

               He spits a massive bullet of tobacco juice, then calmly and
               methodically unzips his leather case and pulls out a very
               unusual, long-barrel, rifle.

               Miller and his men give him some room.  Hamill and his men,
               along with Upham, watch curiously.

               Jackson opens a two-foot tripod with a flick of his wrist,
               sits down and carefully attaches the rifle to it.  Then he
               takes a scope from a narrow wooden box and mounts it.  He
               adjusts the eye-piece and clicks in the bolt-action.  Upham
               is fascinated.UPHAMWhat is that?

               Jackson pulls back the bolt and loads a single, over-sized
               shell.JACKSONThirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel
                         with dual-groove, parallel rifling,

               Jackson sights on a tree about a thousand yards away and
               FIRES.  Evaluates.  Calibrates the scope.  He re-loads.

               Jackson FIRES AGAIN.  Evaluates.  Perfect.  He wipes the
               dirt and sweat from his forehead, puts his eye to the sight
               and waits, absolutely motionless.UPHAMThat must be four thousand yards.JACKSON(without taking his
                              eye from the scope)
                         Forty-two-hundred, I figure.UPHAMYou take account of the wind?

               Jackson doesn't dignify that with an answer but he looks
               back with an expression that clearly says, "What are you,
               some kind of fucking idiot?" Reiben puts himself between
               Upham and Jackson.REIBEN(put-on Southern accent)
                         Dang right, he take 'count of the

               trigger.JACKSONReiben, how many time I got to tell
                         you, I'm from Tennessee.REIBENThey got squirrels there, too, right?

               Jackson FIRES.  Waits.  A tiny smile.  He starts taking apart
               the rifle.  A very impressed Captain Hamill barks to his
               radioman.  Captain Hamill Get a hold of Command, tell them
               the St. Mere road is open.

               The Radioman cranks up his radio.  Captain Hamill turns to
               Miller.

               Captain Hamill How far back is the rest of division?MILLERVery far, they're not coming this
                         way, they're going to take Caen first.

               Captain Hamill Goddamn it, I was afraid of that.  We're in a
               lot of trouble up here, and it's gonna get worse before it
               gets better.  How many men did you bring?MILLERFive, but we not staying, we're on
                         our way to Ramelle.

               Captain hamill Shit, are you the guys going up to find Private
               Ryan?MILLERYeah, you know about that?

               Captain hamill Command radioed, wanted to know if he came in
               with the early wounded or dead.

               Several of CAPTAIN HAMILL'S MEN, among them a GENTLE-FACED
               PRIVATE, prick up their ears at the mention of Private Ryan.

               Captain hamill We're supposed to tell you, they intercepted
               a German transmission after you left.  The Krauts have two
               companies on their way to Ramelle to take back that bridge,
               they'll be there sometime late tomorrow.MILLERWonderful.

               Captain Hamill If Ryan's alive, you'd better get him the
               hell out of there before those Krauts show up.MILLERHow do we get out of here?

               Captain hamill You don't, until tonight, we're hemmed in
               real tight.  After dark you try to slip out to the east.  If
               you tip-toe, stay off the main roads and roll a few sevens,
               you've got a fair chance of making it up to Ramelle by
               tomorrow night.

               Miller processes the information.  Captain Hamill shakes his
               head.

               Captain hamill Tough, huh?  Three brothers?

               Miller shrugs.

               Captain hamill We sure as hell could use your help here, but
               I understand what you're doing?MILLERYeah?

               Captain hamill Good luck.MILLERThanks.

               Captain hamill I mean it.  Find him.  Get him home.

               Miller is a bit taken aback by Captain Hamill's forceful
               sincerity.  Then he shakes it off and motions to his men.MILLERLet's find someplace to hole up.

               Miller nods to Captain Hamill, then, as he moves to the head
               of the alley, Miller passes Upham.UPHAMSir, I'm sorry about what happened,I...MILLER(interrupting)

               He takes off, crouch-running back down the block.  Upham
               watches him go.UPHAMDid you see what he did, back there?
                         He stepped right into the open, so I

                         rest of us have mothers.MILLERYou have orders, too.JACKSONSir, I have an opinion on this matter.MILLERI'd love to hear it.JACKSONSeems to me, Cap'n, this mission is

               settle down into the debris, close their eyes and try to
               follow Miller's order.  Upham looks around at these strange
               men, then, a simple, hard glare from Miller makes him follow
               suit.

               flashlight.  He turns it on, in the dim glow of the light,

               flashlight, studying his maps.  Sarge lies near him, awake,
               watching him.  Sarge notices some unopened envelopes in
               Miller's map case and speaks quietly to him.SARGEYou ever going to open those letters?
                         Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.MILLERMaybe.SARGEIt's not normal, not reading letters

               Miller looks at Sarge.  A moment passes between the two of
               them, then miller takes refuge in the maps.  Sarge looks at
               the men.SARGEYou think they'll be alright?MILLERThey're fine.  As long as they can
                         gripe, they'll be alright.SARGEAnd what about you?

               Upham recoils.  Miller instantly regrets his words.  He turns
               to Upham and sees that he's really scared.  Miller get a
               hold of himself and speaks gently.MILLERDon't worry, Upham, God'll protect

                         all night, anyway.

               Upham manages a slight smile.  Miller watches the lights for
               a moment more, then he pretends to shrug it off.MILLERLet's go, this ain't what they pay
                         us for.

               the way.

               move out, on of Captain Hamill's men, the Gentle-Faced Private
               who was so interested in the talk of Private Ryan, steps up
               with a couple bandoleers of B.A.R. ammo.  He offers them to

               Reiben looks at the bandoleers and is about to give a smart-

               night is dark.  The band of six Americans makes their way
               warily along a French cart path.  Sarge eases up alongside
               Miller and speaks quietly to him.  The others don't overhear.

               on.EXT. FRENCH CART PATH - NIGHT (LATER)Farther along.  The men are tired but alert.  Jackson is at
               point.  Miller behind him.  The others at intervals.  Sarge
               brings up the rear.

               A SOUND.  Jackson stops.  No one speaks, they communicate
               only with hand signals.

               JACKSON SIGNALS to Miller, ten, twenty, thirty men coming.

               MILLER SIGNALS for the men to get off the path.  They ease
               into the brush.  An instant later, a PAIR WARY GERMAN INFANTRY
               MEN appear.

               REIBEN grips his B.A.R. and looks to Miller for permission
               to open up.  Miller shakes his head and signals, "let them
               go." A moment later AN ENTIRE PLATOON OF GERMANS rounds the
               bend.  Fifty men.  Heavily armed.  REIBEN breathes a sigh of
               relief and lowers hi B.A.R.

               THE GERMAN PLATOON passes, their boots no more than two feet
               from the faces of the hidden Americans.  Upham is wide-eyed
               with fear.  The others are stone-faced.THE GERMANS PASS.MILLER MOTIONS for his men to hold their positions.

               UPHAM doesn't see the signal.  He stands, breathing a sigh
               of relief, just as a GERMAN WHIP-TAIL SQUAD appears, trailing
               the platoon by thirty meters, protecting their rear.

               UPHAM FREEZES.  He's standing, barely in the shadows, nearly
               exposed.  Shitting bricks.

               Pissed, MILLER prepares to fire.  The Whip-tail squad
               approaches.

               Then, the GERMANS PASS, miraculously, not seeing Upham in
               the shadows.  They walk on and disappear.  Upham is weak-
               kneed, amazed that he's still alive.

               MILLER shoots a devastating glare at him, then signals the
               rest of the men to follow him into the woods.  Upham scurries
               after Miller, staying close on his heels.EXT. FIELD - NIGHTThe little band of Americans walks along the edge of a field,
               parallel to a cart path.  Wary.

               Miller notices Jackson and Wade drifting too close to each
               other.  He SNAPS HIS FINGERS, getting their attention, and
               motions curtly for them to open it up a bit.  They do so.EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHTDark.  FAINT DISTANT ARTILLERY.  Miller checks the map as
               Sarge shines a red flashlight on an array of directional
               signs.  One of them reads:  "Ramelle 16 Km." Miller puts
               away the map.  Checks the horizon.  The first glow of dawn
               is visible.MILLERIt'll be light, soon.  Let's pick it

               Miller stands, a bit apart from the others, looking out at
               the view.  It's lovely.  Dew shimmers on the long grass.
               The war is far away.

               Upham walks next to him.  They look out at the view together
               without speaking for a moment.MILLERIt looks like a Renoir.UPHAMYes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth

               Upham looks closely at Miller and sees that he means it.UPHAMFive hundred, then.

               Miller takes a last look at the view and allows himself to
               feel an overwhelming wave of sadness.  Then he turns himself
               back into a commander and barks at Upham.MILLERLet's go, private.

               Miller strides away.  Upham watches him, trying to figure
               him out, then he simply follows him.EXT. HEDGEROW LANE - DAWNThe seven Americans walk along a hedgerow lane, untouched by
               war.  Spreading trees arch gently over the lane which is

               An old FRENCH FARMER kneels on the ground, weeping, next to
               this SLAUGHTERED FAMILY, two adult women, an adult male and
               a boy, no more than ten.  His animals, a pair of cows and a
               draft horse and some pigs are dead as well, shot to pieces.
               A DEAD AMERICAN PARATROOPER lies sprawled in the dirt with
               empty shell casings around his body.

               Miller and his men approach carefully.  Miller motions to
               Upham who squats down next to the French Farmer and speaks
               gently to him in French.

               The FARMER SPEAKS SOFTLY as if in a trance.  Upham stands
               and translates.UPHAMFive nights ago, he found this
                         paratrooper caught in a tree with a

                         to get a doctor.  The doctor refused
                         to come and when he got back, this
                         is what he found.  The Krauts must
                         have shown up while he was gone.MILLERDid he see any sign of them?

               Upham gently asks.  The FARMER ANSWERS.UPHAMNo, but he heard firing, just east,

                         about his loss.

               Miller heads off without glancing back.  The men hesitate.
               Sarge jerks his head for them to move out.  They do so.

               Upham squats down and speaks softly to the Farmer, puts his
               hand on the man's shoulder, then rises and follows the others.EXT. HEDGEROW FIELD - DAYA beautiful, hedgerow-lined field of tall grass.  The last
               of the dew and morning mist is just burning off.

               The six Americans walk carefully through the woods to the
               edge of the field.

               Miller notices something.  He silently signals stop, crouches
               and scans the field and the hedgerow on the far side.

               Sarge and Jackson ease up next to him.  Jackson points to
               some trees nearby, freshly shattered and pock-marked with

               WADE LOCKS EYES WITH MILLER.  Looking at him without blame,

                         closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers
                         slightly as he unclips one of Wades
                         dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it.
                         Sarge notices.

               Miller stares at his hand and steadies it before the men
               see.  He picks up the dogtag and pockets it.

               Then Miller carefully re-packs the un-used morphine and sulfa,
               rises and picks up his Thompson.

               Miller motions to them curtly.MILLERKeep it down.

               They shut up.  Miller falls in step to Sarge.  Speaks quietly,
               the men don't hear.MILLERWe've got to find someplace to hole
                         up for a bit.

               Miller speaks authoritatively and says the right things, but
               there's something missing.  It's subtle.  Only Sarge notices.
               He watches Miller head off into the brush alone.EXT. SMALL CLEARING - DAYMiller walks into a small clearing, slows then stops.  The
               life drains from him.  He stands there, looking at the dirt,
               tilting his head, this way and that, as if listening for
               faint, distant voices.  His face shows a battle raging within,
               as he fights to keep from losing it entirely.  Behind him,
               Sarge steps to the edge of the clearing and watches.  Miller
               senses his presence, turns and looks at him if he were a
               thousand miles away.  Sarge sits down on a log and waits.MILLERWhat was the name of that kid at

                         sing that song about the man on flying
                         trapeze?SARGEYeah.MILLERYou know why I'm such a good officer?
                         Because of my mother.  Have I ever
                         told you about her?SARGEBits and pieces.MILLERShe's the best poker player you ever
                         saw.  My father used to go to these
                         Saturday night games and lose his
                         shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him
                         an ultimatum, either she gets a
                         regular seat at the table or she
                         locks him in every Saturday night.
                         He squawked and so did his buddies
                         but after a while they gave in and
                         from the first night she sat down,
                         she never lost.  She could read those
                         cocky bastards like they were playing
                         open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had
                         sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her
                         eyes, the tone of her voice, her
                         bets, her jokes, the way she sipped
                         her coffee, she was a master.  She
                         won more money on shit hands than
                         anyone in the history of the game.
                         Every Saturday night, my father would
                         lose two, three hundred bucks and
                         she'd win it all back and then some.
                         And I'd stand there, glued to her
                         shoulder, from the time I was five
                         years old, watching every hand, every
                         move, studying how she did it.
                              (beat)
                         That's why I'm such a good officer,
                         I can look at a man's face and tell
                         you exactly what he's holding, and
                         if it's a shit hand, I know just
                         what cards to deal him.SARGEAnd what about your own hand?MILLERNo problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less?
                         So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear
                         me apart when I'd get one of my men
                         killed, but what was I supposed to
                         do?  Break down in front of the ones
                         who were standing there waiting for
                         me to tell them what to do?  Of course
                         not, so I bluffed, and after a while,
                         I started to fall for my own bluff.
                         It was great, it made everything so
                         much easier.  Sarge Is that why your
                         hand's been shaking?MILLERIt could be worse.  You know the
                         first thing they teach you at O.C.S.?
                         Lie to your men.SARGEOh, yeah?MILLERNot in so many words, but they tell
                         you you can have all the firepower
                         in the world and if your men don't
                         have good morale, it's not worth a
                         damn.  So if you're scared or empty
                         or half-a-step from a Section Eight,
                         do you tell your men?  Of course
                         not.  You bluff, you lie.SARGEAnd how do you bluff yourself?MILLERSimple, numbers.  Every time you
                         kill one of your men, you tell
                         yourself you just saved the lives of
                         two, three, ten, a hundred others.
                         We lost, what, thirty-one on the
                         cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times
                         that number by putting out those
                         guns.  That's over three hundred
                         men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand.
                         Then thousand.  Any number you want.
                         See?  It's simple.  It lets you always
                         choose mission over men.SARGEExcept this time, the mission IS a
                         man.MILLERThat's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's
                         Ryan?  If they're both standing in
                         front of me and I have to shoot one
                         or the other, how do I choose?  Look
                         at my hand, there it goes again.SARGEJohn, I've got to tell you, I think
                         you're about used up.MILLERI think you're right, Keith.SARGEYou want me to take over?

               The question helps Miller pull himself back together.  He
               looks at his hand and forces it to stop shaking again.MILLERNo, but if I get any worse, you'll
                         have to relieve me.SARGE(sighs)
                         Just what I want to do.

                         you do, they might make me give back

                         to lip off to colonels anymore.SARGEI'll do my best.

               They shake their heads at the madness of it all.  Miller

               Miller picks up his Thompson and looks around, re-orienting
               himself.  He's about ninety-five percent there.MILLERThanks for drawing that machine gun
                         off me.SARGEYou're welcome, John.MILLERBut, that's my personal brand of

                         busted.

               Sarge allows himself a slight smile.SARGEYes, sir.

               Miller jerks his head for Sarge to follow.  They head back
               to the men.EXT. CLEARING - DAYThe men are all in their private worlds, thinking of Wade.

               No one responds.MILLERI said, who the hell is Wade?

               The men exchange looks.  Jackson speaks for them.JACKSONSir, I understand what you're doin',
                         but I respectfully request permission
                         to grieve in my own manner.MILLERYou'll grieve the way I tell you to
                         goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade,
                         there was one, but he died a long

                         but I understand.MILLERGood, now get your goddamned gear.

               The men pick up their equipment and prepare to move out.
               Sarge and Miller exchange a silent look.  Miller shakes his
               head to himself, amazed that the men still allow this shit
               to work.  He knows they have no choice.EXT. FRENCH ROAD - DAYMiller and his men walk along the road.  The men are silent,

               Miller laughs.  Miller I'll bite, Reiben.REIBENI've given this a lot of thought,
                         sir.  The best thing that could happen
                         is, we find Ryan and he's dead.MILLERWhy's that?REIBENWell, sir, consider the possibilities.
                         A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take
                         him back to the beach.  Knowing you,
                         you don't let him carry my gear,
                         even though he really should, and we
                         all get killed, trying to keep him
                         alive.MILLERExcept for the last part, that one's
                         not bad.REIBENB:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown
                         up by the German equivalent of Wade,
                         whose name I know you don't want me
                         to mention.  There's nothing to find.
                         The biggest piece is the size of a
                         pea.  We wander around, looking for
                         him until the Germans pick us off,
                         one after another.MILLERI don't like that one.REIBENNeither do I, sir.  C:  And this is
                         the worst one, we find Ryan and he's
                         wounded.  Not only does he not carry
                         my gear, we have to carry his gear.
                         And him.MILLERBut we accomplish the mission.REIBENMaybe.  But what if he dies on the
                         way back?  you see what I'm saying,
                         sir?  The best possible situation
                         is, he's dead, we find his body,
                         more or less intact, we grab one of
                         his dog-tags and high-tail it back
                         to the beach, or better yet, we head

               Suddenly Miller stops dead.  He listens, hearing something
               the others don't hear.  He motions for them to freeze, they
               do.  The SOUND grows louder.  It's an OMINOUS RUMBLE.MILLERI don't think so.EXT. FRENCH ROAD - DAYTHE RUMBLE turns into the ROAR OF A BIG GERMAN CONVOY.  Troop

               Just then they hear an OMINOUS RUMBLE, deeper and more
               threatening that that of the convoy.  The sound gets LOUDER
               and LOUDER.  Miller and his men exchange looks.  They know
               that sound, they don't like it.FOUR MASSIVE GERMAN TANKSAppear down the road, heading for the German soldiers who
               greet them enthusiastically.  The tanks are tigers, huge,
               far bigger than an American Sherman.  Each one, sixty-two
               tons, with a big 88-mm gun, four heavy machine guns and
               impregnable armor.  Each one, an infantryman's nightmare.

                         his head for his men to follow, low,
                         along the wall.  The men are happy
                         to do so, looking back nervously at

               civilians.  Miller and his men enter the square, weapons
               ready, leap-frogging from doorway to doorway.

               Miller and Sarge crouch-run to the cover of some overhanging
               debris.  They listen, trying to pinpoint the exact source of
               the firing.

               Sarge motions his guess.  Miller nods in agreement.  He
               signals for the men to follow him around, not toward, the
               firing.

               They move on, dashing from cover to cover.EXT. BRIDGE - RAMELLE - DAYA dozen AMERICAN PARATROOPERS on the bridge exchange SPORADIC
               FIRE with a few German snipers hidden in the buildings near
               the bridgehead.  The bridge has clearly been the scene of
               heavy fighting.  Craters, burning debris and shell casings
               are everywhere.  The bridge is intact, only slightly damaged.
               There are dozens of German bodies along the riverbank on

               He finds himself next to SERGEANT BILL FORREST who was the

               Forrest motions to one of the paratroopers.

               Forrest Go get Ryan.(TO MILLER)What do you want him for, sir?

               Miller doesn't answer.  Jackson leaps over the barricade and
               scrambles to them.MILLERJackson, get a hold of command.

               Jackson cranks up the five-thirty-five.  Miller turns to

               They pause to FIRE, covering Sarge, the last of Miller's men
               to leap over the barricade.

               Forrest Eleven, sir.  We started with thirty-six.  The bridge
               was easy to take but the Krauts have been coming back at us
               ever since.  They must want it intact or we'd be long gone.

               Forrest Sir, what do you want with Ryan?

               Miller doesn't answer, he looks past Forrest and sees:PRIVATE JAMES RYANDashing from cover to cover, making
                         his way toward them.  Ryan is an
                         American classic, nineteen years
                         old, earthy, handsome, sharp, cocky.
                         Though he's exhausted, unshaven, and
                         smeared with dirt and blood, he's
                         very alive.  His eyes shine, his
                         face has a spark.  You can't help
                         but love this kid.MILLER'S MENAll watch Ryan run toward them.JACKSONSo, that's Ryan.REIBENLooks like a flaming asshole to me.

               Their eyes remain glued to Ryan as he makes it to the
               barricade.  He salutes Miller.REIBENI'm Ryan, sir.  You wanted to see
                         me?

               Miller looks at Ryan for a moment, amazed that he's finally
               face-to-face with him.  Ryan waits.  Miller hesitates,
               searching for words.  Then he speaks gently but clearly.
               Miller Private, I've got some bad news for you.  Your brothers
               have been killed in action.

               The life instantly drains from Ryan.  His breath comes hard.
               Somehow he remains upright.

               Ryan All three?MILLERYes.

               Ryan sways.  Miller grabs him and eases him back, leaning
               him against some sandbags.THE PARATROOPERSAre stunned at the news.  They look
                         at Ryan, there's nothing else they
                         can do.MILLER'S MENAlso look at Ryan, but then, one
                         after another, they turn away,
                         adverting their eyes, looking a their
                         own boots, the debris on the bridge,
                         the sky, anything other than Ryan.MILLERWe've been sent to get you out of
                         here.  You're going home.

               Ryan weakly waves Miller off.  Miller motions to his men and
               the paratroopers to move away.  They do so, giving Ryan a
               little room.

               Forrest Three brothers, the poor son-of-a-bitch.MILLERSergeant, we're moving out and I'm
                         taking you and your men with me.

               Forrest But, sir, our orders are clear, we're to hold this
               bridge until we're relieved by forward elements of the Twenty-
               ninth Division.MILLERI'm giving you new orders, Sergeant.

               Forrest Sir, you can't do that, these orders are from command.MILLERI'm not going to leave you and your
                         men here to get killed.  Get them
                         together, we're moving out.

               A VOICE from behind them speaks simply, clearly, firmly.RYAN (O.S.)No, sir.

               They all turn and see Ryan standing there.  Miller is about
               to automatically rip Ryan a new asshole for contradicting
               him, but he quickly calms himself, gently touches Ryan on
               the arm and speaks softly to him.MILLERCome on, Private, you're going home.

               Ryan jerks away from Miller.RYANNo, sir.

               All eyes are on Miller and Ryan.  Miller remains patient.MILLERPrivate.  I'm sorry about your
                         brothers but staying here and getting
                         yourself killed isn't going to help.RYANSir, if the Krauts are holding this
                         bridge when division shows up, our
                         guys are going to be sitting ducks.MILLERThis bridge cannot be held.  The
                         Germans have two companies less than
                         three miles from here.  They have
                         tanks.

               That news clearly affects Ryan and the other paratroopers,
               but Ryan holds his ground.  Ryan Sir, I'm still not going.

               Miller speaks with restrained, but growing, anger.MILLERPrivate, if you want to commit
                         suicide, that's your choice, but
                         you're going to have to wait until
                         after I get you back to the beach.
                         And you're not going to take these
                         men with you.

               Ryan stands eye-to-eye with Miller.RYANI'm not leaving, sir.

               Miller starts to boil over.MILLERThe hell you aren't, you're comin'
                         with me if I have to drag you every
                         inch of the way.  You hear me,
                         Private?RYANI hear you sir, but I'm not leaving.

               Miller grabs Ryan by the lapels and shakes him.  Ryan doesn't
               resist.MILLERListen you little son-of-a-bitch
                         you're coming with me or
                         I'll...I'll...

               Ryan speaks softly.RYANWhat are you going to do, sir, shoot
                         me?

               Miller considers it.  Then REIBEN SPEAKS UP from behind

               hears something over the SOUNDS OF FIRING.MILLERHOLD IT!  HOLD IT!Ryan and Reiben cease firing.  Now they hear it, too.

               A RUMBLE, DEEPER AND MORE OMINOUS than any they've heard

                         The fear on their faces turns to
                         resignation.  They know that they
                         are dead men.  They settle into their
                         positions, and prepare to fire and
                         die.

               They wait.  The RUMBLE GETS LOUDER AND LOUDER.

               THEN MILLER'S FACE STARTS TO CHANGE...a hint...of a
               smile...then a real smile...

               with scores of heavily-armed American soldiers.

               They keep coming and coming.  American tanks, with wave after
               wave of U.S. infantrymen, looking for targets.  They find a
               few among the departing Germans.THE ADVANCING TROOPSRun onto the bridge and start to
                         secure the position.  A SERGEANT and
                         a few of HIS MEN look around,
                         curiously eyeing Miller, Reiben and
                         Ryan, battered and bloody, standing
                         among the bodies.

               A MAJOR strides up.

               One of the soldiers speaks quietly to another.

               Soldier That's him, that's Ryan.

               The Major puts his hand on Ryan's shoulder.

               Major Command is looking for you, son.  You're going home.

               Ryan looks up, tired.  He nods.EXT. RAMELLE BRIDGE HEAD - DAYAmerican tanks and hundreds of fresh troops stream down the
               road and over the bridge.MILLER, RYAN AND REIBENWatch.  In a small area, cleared of the debris, the bodies
               of Jackson, Upham, Sarge, Forrest and the other paratroopers
               are laid out, neatly, respectfully, covered.

               Miller and Reiben stay protectively close to Ryan, as if
               they don't want to risk him being bumped into or run over by
               any of the advancing troops or vehicles.MILLERWalks to the bodies.  He kneels down
                         next to Sarge and looks at him for a
                         long moment.  Then, with a steady
                         hand, he takes one of Sarge's two
                         dog-tags.  Then he does the same to
                         Jackson and Upham.

                         who grips them tightly and nods in
                         thanks.

               Miller takes a last look at the bridge and the bodies, then
               he shoulders his gear.  Miller Let's move out.

               Reiben and Ryan gather up their gear.  They walk with Miller
               down the road, away from the bridge.CAMERA CRANES UPThe three dirty, bloodied, tired men

               They walk on, disappearing in the distance among the hundreds
               and hundreds of American soldiers who are marching down the
               road and over the bridge.
