FINAL DESTINATION 2
                          By J. Mackye Gruber and Eric BressFADE IN:INT. DARK ROOM - NIGHTTITLES OVER:A padded wall is papered with NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS that date back to
the early 1900s:

"LOCAL FOWLER BROTHERS LOSE $35 TICKETS TO BOARD TITANIC" appears
over "FOWLER BROTHERS KILLED IN COAL MINE MISHAP." Another series of
articles reads, "JEWISH PROFESSOR DENIED ADMITTANCE TO HINDENBURG"
and "PROFESSOR RABINOWITZ KILLED IN AVALANCHE." Etc...

Continuing along the wall, the newspaper articles all focus on the
fates of the original SURVIVORS of the FLIGHT 180 CRASH.

We DISSOLVE between the various headlines depicting the gruesome
deaths of Tod, Terry, Ms. Lewton, Billy Hitchcock, Carter and Alex
Browning.

Also in the mix are various CRIME SCENE PHOTOS of the deaths.

Decapitated torsos, crushed, mangled bodies, the charred remains of
another and the face- down body of Alex Browning.

MAPS line the walls as well, pinpointing the locations of numerous
deaths, perhaps seeking a pattern. Charts that timeline bizarre
deaths, seating charts of downed aircraft, etc...

corners and place it in the center of all the others:A REMEMBRANCE FOR THE VICTIMS OF FLIGHT 180Friday marks one year anniversary.END TITLES.FLASH TO BLACK as a HAND ENTERS FRAME, PULL BACK TO REVEAL:EXT. KIMBERLY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAYKIMBERLY BURROUGHS, 19, puts a folded AAA map in her mouth. She opens
the back of a RED NISSAN SUV, and pla ces her duffel bag inside.

That done, she lets the map drop from her mouth, catches it in her
free hand and turns to hug her father, MR. BURROUGHS.KIMBERLYThanks, Dad. I'll call you.MR. BU RROUGHSYou have everything, Kimberly?
             Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?KIMBERLYRelax, Dad. It's Daytona, not

             Sunblock? Mace?SHAINA (O.S.)Condoms, handcuffs, lube?

Kimberly and Mr. Burroughs turn to see --

SHAINA, 19, tall leggy brunette. Tan, tight tube top revealing her
pierced navel, Kimberly's best friend. She walks up the driveway with
her bags.SHAINAJust kidding, Mr. B. Don't worry,
             I'll keep an eye on her.MR. BURROUGHS(sarcastic)
             Oh, that makes me feel a lot
             better.

Shaina throws her bags in, shuts the back and climbs in the SUV.
Kimberly hugs her dad, kissing him on the cheek.KIMBERLYI know this is the first time we've
             been apart since. But everything's
             gonna be okay.MR. BURROUGHSI know, honey. I just --

Kimberly hugs him tighter. Cutting him off.MR. BURROUGHSYour mother would have been so
             proud of the way you've handled
             yourself through all of this...KIMBERLY(softly)
             I know, Dad.SHAINA (O.S.)Hello, the guys are waiting!Kimberly gives him a quick kiss, jumps behind the wheel, starts the
car and pulls away as Shaina cranks up the stereo.MR. BURROUGHSBuckle up!

Mr. Burroughs waves as the girls roar off. As he looks down he spots
an OIL STAIN left by Kimberly's SUV. As he drags his shoe across the
stain, a SLIGHT BREEZE blows past his face.

CAMERA PUSHES IN as a look of concern crosses his face.EXT. HIGHWAY ON RAMP - DAYON OLD WOMANAs she pushes her supermarket cart up the on ramp. A SQUEAKY WHEEL is
shrill and disturbing.

DRIVERS of several waiting vehicles avoid staring at her weathered
face as she passes. Up ahead waiting in line, is Kimberly's red SUV.UP AHEADWaiting in line, is Kimberly's red SUV.SHAINA (O.S.)Watch it!

Kimberly accidentally KISSES the bumper in front of her while
daydreaming. She calls out to the driver in front:KIMBERLYSorry!   My fault!

Shaina looks over, concerned. In the backseat, the guys DANO and
FRANKIE laugh hard and some of Frankie's milkshake comes out of his
nose.SHAINAWant me to drive?KIMBERLYNo, I'm good.

Shaina looks at Kimberly as a HAND suddenly hits Kimberly's window.
Kimberly spins around, startled.

Kimberly stares transfixed at the Old Woman, who stares back with
chilling intensity.

The kids ad-lib "Let's go" and "Fucking freak." The Old Woman's
PLASTIC BAG BREAKS, sending oranges rolling down the on- ramp. The OldWoman breaks eye contact with Kimberly as she rushes to retrieve
them.

The signal turns from red to flashing yellow.

Kimberly pulls the SU V onto the highway, looking in the side view
mirror to see the Old Woman look up at her in SLOW-MO.FRANKIEDano, shouldn't we go back and help
              your mother?DANOBlo w me.CU ON KIMBERLYAs she looks back from the mirror and reacts to an ominous electronic
road sign that flashes "WARNING: CONSTRUCTION NEXT 180 FEET".NISSAN SUVKimberly merging into traffic, NEARLY COLLIDES with a speeding yellow
mini- bus carrying a high- school football team.

Kimberly nervously jerks the wheel to the right, then realizing she's
speeding towards the road construction barrels, she swerves back
left, right behind the mini-bus at the last moment.CLOSE.Kimberly pulls around the mini-bus as rowdy football players tackle
each other, yelling:FOOTBALL PLAYERSPile up!    Pile up! Pile up!

Kimberly flicks on the radio and we hear HIGHWAY TO HELL by AC/DC at
earsplitting volume. Kimberly and Shaina jump from the shock and
reach to lower the volume.

Kimberly, disturbed by this, hits SEEK -- an oldies station. A GRISLY
CAR CRASH from Nervous Norvus' TRANSFUSION album.DANOChrist, is this tribute to Princess
                 Di Day or what?

Kimberly passes a car WEAVING on her right. The driver reaching into
the back seat to quiet a BARKING DOG hanging on its head out the
window.KIMBERLY(unnerved)
              Jesus, all the crazies are out
              today.

A CLOUD passes Kimberly's head. She smells it and turns around,
taking her eyes off the road to see Dano smoking a joint.KIMBERLYI told you no drugs in the car!    My
              dad will freak!

Dano and Frankie exchange looks, God, what a geek!DANO(laughs)
              Calm down, Kimmy.   It's not drugs,
              just weed.FRANKIEYeah, you should have specified.

Kimberly turns to Shaina, helpless. Shaina spins around, her eyes
wordlessly tell Dano, I know she's a priss, but put it out.

Then Kimberly's CELL PHONE RINGS. She hits the speaker button.MR. BURROUGHS (V.O.)Kimberly? It's Dad.KIMBERLYHey, Dad. What's up?

Dano defiantly blows more smoke toward Kimberly, then breaks into an
unexpected coughing fit - looking over to see a HELLS ANGEL laughing
at hi m. The biker's trashy GIRLFRIEND, also laughing, quickly FLASHES
HER TITS at Dano over:MR. BURROUGHS (V.O.)Your car's leaking either
              transmission or brake fluid. I
              want you to have it checked ASAP at
              a gas station.KIMBERLYYou got it, Dad. I'll call you if
              I have a problem.MR. BURROUGHS (V.O.)I mean it. Take care of it.KIMBERLYI will, Dad. Bye, luv you.Kimberly passes a STATION WAGON on her right, the DRIVER squinting at
a map while driving. A mattress and some furniture tied to the top
SHIFT as the wagon hits a bump.SHAINAUm, Kimberly, your dad's not gonna
               call like every ten minutes is he?

Before Kimberly can answer, Dano sees a CHP speeding up behind him.
He lowers the joint at once.DANO(hiding bag of weed in
                           pants)
               Shit! There's a cop behind us.
               Pull into the right lane now!

Kimberly, scared, does as she's told nearly colliding with a speeding
flat bed semi hauling a huge load of logs !

A HORN BLASTS. The truck swerves. Then speeds by on the right. A
COILED CHAIN drops down to the highway.DANOLook first, idiot!

Shaina turns up the radio and leans over to Kimberly.SHAINAIgnore 'em.ON LOG TRUCKOne end of the RUSTY CHAIN holding the logs in place rattles on the
pavement, sparking.

Looking in her rearview mirror, Kimberly turns pale - the COP pulls
in behind her.KIMBERLYDano, put that out NOW.

Dano takes one last drag and flicks the joint out the window. It
bounces on the windshield of a FORD EXPEDITION to their left.INSIDE THE EXPEDITIONKAT, 28, very corporate America, wears a navy blue power suit and
speaks into a phone headset while smoking a cigarette.KATNo, I'm stuck on Jury Duty so I
             won't be able to pitch the
             campaign. Let's get Silverstein to
             come in and...

Kat sees the joint that smoulders in the dried leaves beneath her
windshield wipers. A moment later, a small FLAME crackles.KATWhat the hell?     No,   not you.

Kat flicks on her WINDSHIELD WIPER FLUID, successfully putting out
the joint, but her worn wipers smear ash and fluid around, impairing
her vision.

Kat turns and looks at --

DANO, dead serious all of a sudden. Staring straight ahead.DANOWhat's the cop doing?      Did he see
             that?

Kat sees the tailgating CHP, smiles, then resumes her conversation.KATForget it, I'll call him myself.

Kat hangs up, then looks down at her cell phone, squints and dials a
number...PAN OFF KAT TO OFFICER THOMAS BURKEEarly 20's, rookie cop, who seems to have missed the entire exchange.INSIDE THE POLICE CARThomas speaks into his radio.THOMASI was supposed to be off today.
             How did I get screwed?DISPATCHER (O.S.)No biggie. Drake called in sick.THOMASCopy that.
                    (switches off; annoyed)
             Go on, sleep it off Drake.

Thomas tries to sip from a McDonald's coffee cup on the dashboard,
but it's TOO HOT. He places it back on the dash.The VIBRATIONS of the road make the COFFEE CUP slide closer and
closer to the edge of the dashboard.BACK TO KIMBERLY'S SUVDano nervously looks back.FRANKIERelax, dude.

But Kimberly still looks uneasy as her dashboard "Check Engine" light
begins flickering.

Kimberly spots a road sign -- Next Service 18 Miles.KIMBERLYThis trip better be wor th it.
             What's the guy- girl ratio again?SHAINAGet ready to smile, five guys per
             girl.KIMBERLYI can live with thaaaa --

Kimberly stops mid-sentence when the WHITE VAN in front of her
suddenly SLAMS ON ITS BRAKES and pulls onto the shoulder for no
reason. Kimberly SCREAMS, swerving around the van just in time to
avoid an accident. Frankie instinctively SHOUTS at the van.FRANKIEWhat's your problem, ya fuckin'
              crack baby?!INSIDE THE WHITE VANISABELLA CRUZ, late 20's and VERY PREGNANT, drives a delivery van
full of funeral wreaths, crosses and classic rose urns. Most are
marked: In Memory of Flight 180.

She chokes back sobs into a cell phone as she pulls over.ISABELLA...couldn't Keep your dick in check
             for another month? I knew this
             would happen when I got pregnant.

She pounds the steering wheel, furious.ISABELLAWhat'd the doctor say? I have to
              come in to test for STDs? Goddamnyou, Jorge.

A CRATE in the back of her van topples over and CRASHES and a flurry
of sunflower petals sails out the window. Isabella jumps in surprise
and, wiping tears from her eyes, rolls up the windows as petals
shower the visor of --

EUGENE, the Harley Rider, who smears the petals (and some squashed
bugs) around his visor and drops back.INSIDE NISSAN SUVKimberly falls back into the right lane and looks uneasy as she sees
a TRUCK DRIVER guzzling from a flask as it passes the SUV, revealing
its side is an ad for FIRESTONE TIRES.

It finally clears frame, revealing a highway billboard that reads,"DRUNK DRIVING KILLS."Kimberly reaches back and pulls on her seatbelt in spite of laughter
from the back seat.

Up ahead, the RUSTY CHAIN seems to have more give to it. LOGS STRAIN
against it.

Suddenly, a black cloud of exhaust from a blue '83 Chevette in front
of them causes everyone to roll up their windows.

OIL DRIPS from its rusty exhaust pipe. The thick exhaust BLINDS
Kimberly.FRANKIEGas it around these idiots. We do
               have 1200 miles to go, you know.

Kimberly tires to enter the passing lane, but she's blocked by a
SUBURU WAGON. In the front seat, a seven- year old kid is sadistically
SMASHING two toy cars together.

Kimberly passes the Suburu and pulls up to a PACER. The Harley roars
by, startling her.INSIDE PACERNORA KESNER, 35, and her son TIM, 15. Tim drums on the dashboard with
two ten-ounce Naya bottles.NORATim, will you cut that out? I
               can't even hear myself think.

Tim frowns and then winces, holding his jaw.TIMDamn, it really hurts, Mom.NORAI know, we'll be there soon.

Tim drops the Naya bottles on the seat. One of them quietly falls to
the floor, rolls a bit, finally settling UNDER THE BRAKE PEDAL.INSIDE NISSAN SUVKimberly is still behind the smoke-spewing Chevette. She passes it on
the left. Frankie rolls down his window.FRANKIE(yells to driver)
              Ever hear of the Ozone layer,
              asshole?INSIDE CHEVETTERORY, 27, leans down to snort a line of coke off a Def Leppard CD
case. S he looks up to see the Patrol Car is now behind him, he
reflexively taps the brakes.

Rory, eyes like saucers, sits rigidly transfixed at the wheel and
nonchalantly wipes the CD clean on his pants.INSIDE NISSAN SUVShe has dropped back behind the Chevette and CHP car and is running
down along side of a BLACK TRANS AM.

Up ahead she sees the Hig hway Patrol Car flick on its LIGHTS and pull
into the shoulder around the Chevette and behind the Semi loaded with
logs.INSIDE THE COP CARAs Thomas pulls in behind the log truck, his coffee cup lurches
forward, spilling hot coffee all over his lap and the floor.THOMASSon of a bitch.INSIDE TRANS AMIts driver, EVAN SCHAEFFER, 21, flashes a cocky smile at Kimberly,
clearly making Frankie jealous.FRANKIEA Trans Am. That shit went out
              with New Kids on the Block.DANOYeah. Who does he think he is?
              Knight Rider?FRANKIE(laughs; then)
              Who?

Frankie leans out and tosses milkshake on Evan's window.DANOYou know, Hasselhoff before he did
              Baywatch.

Evan, pissed off, flips off Frankie. The windshield wipers smear
around the thick milky fluid. The sun blinding him.KIMBERLYWhat's the chance of finding a nice
              mature guy once we get to Daytona?SHAINAHow does a nice mature fuck sound?

Kimberly laughs, then leans in close to Shaina.KIMBERLYHey, thanks for talking    me into
              this trip. Ever since     my mom... I
              dunno, I just feel like    I'm
              starting to live again,    you know?

Shaina smiles in understanding.INSIDE POLICE CRUISERThomas bends to wipe up the mess. He only glances at the road as he
tries to soak up the coffee.

Suddenly up ahead, THE RUSTY CHAIN SNAPS! The logs roll off the side
of the truck onto the highway.

One bounces as it hits, and slams through Thomas' front winshield and
out the back, taking Thomas' head with it.

EUGENE slams on his brakes. His Harley slides out and he is SLAMMED
to the ground, sliding at 60 miles per hour across the highway, right
in front of the yellow mini-bus.

The MINI- BUS DRIVER brakes to avoid Eugene. The FOOTBALL PLAYERS
tumble forward and hit him in the head. He loses control and slides
off the road onto the grass median.

He blows a front tire and the mini-bus begins to flip, ROLLING
several times int o the oncoming lanes of traffic, and is HIT by aMACK TRUCK.Eugene slides into a huge log, and hits it with a sickening crunch.
Only to be HIT and CRUSHED by his sliding motorcycle.

Rory looks up too late and REAR ENDS Thomas' car, EXPLODING the gas
tank and HURLING Rory's dead body halfway through the windshield
where it remains half in/half onto the hood.

KAT, dialing, looks up, slams on her brakes, but SKIDS on oil from
the Chevette.
She swerves into Kimberly, SIDE SWIPES her, then swerves to miss a
huge log -- only to run head on into two more, flipping the
Expedition end over end right next to Kimberly.

Kimberly swerves back from being hit by Kat, just in time to see a
huge log ahead. She tries to turn hard to the right to avoid it, but
hits it broadside --

Sending the SUV FLIPPING OVER the top of the log and SLIDING down the
road. Inside, Shaina, Dano and Frankie are tossed around like rag
dolls, shredded by glass and shrapnel -- Frankie is EJECTED out the
side window.

Kimberly's SUV slides to a stop on its side. She looks back to her
mangled but still alive friends and up in time to seeNORA'S PACERNora sees the collisions ahead and slams on the brakes but the fallen
Naya bottle prevents her from braking, and she SLAMS into the back of
Kat's Expedition.

The crash test dummy collision folds her Pacer and it EXPLODES into a
huge fireball.

EVAN, blinded by the smeared windshield, is too late. He swerves his
Trans Am around the burning cars onto the wet grass.

Kimberly sees the topless Trans Am slowly roll out of a huge WALL OF
FIRE and coast to a stop. Evan comes up battered and bloody but still
alive. He is trapped in his burning car, screaming and trying to
release the seatbelt.

Then, just when she thought it was over, a HUGE SEMI slides thro ugh
the wall of fire, SMASHING the Trans Am out of the way, SPINNING it
like a top. With the back sliding at 90 degrees it keeps on coming.KIMBERLY'S POVThe semi's grill comes right at her!CU ON KIMBERLYShe screams and we --CUT TO:THE HIGHWAY O N RAMP - NISSAN SUV - 8 MINUTES EARLIERSweating profusely, Kimberly's eyes dart around, taking in her

mini- bus with football players speeds past.KIMBERLYOh my god, oh my god...

Dano, confused, rolls a joint.SHAINAWhat is it? What are you?KIMBERLYThere's going to be a huge
             accident! Everyone's gonna die.

Dano hums the Twilight Zone theme.FRANKIEThat's it. My turn to drive.

HONK! The drivers behind them start leaning on their horns. Kimberly
leans out the window and sees the Chevette, the Pacer, The White Van,
the Trans Am, the Harley...all the familiar vehicles from the pile
up. She turns on the radio, frantically scans the dial.SHAINARelax, you need to chill the fuck
              out.KIMBERLYHighway to Hell, Highway to Hell.SHAINAFor Christ sakes girl, take a
              breath.D.J. (O.S.)Taking you into an all request
              weekend with a classic from AC/DC.

The opening guitar riff to HIGHWAY TO HELL blares from the speakers.
Kimberly turns to Shaina with a "believe me know?" look, but Shaina's
nowhere near on the same page.

HONKING behind them.

Kimberly, shaking like a leaf, pulls the SUV forwards, turning it
sideways to block off all traffic.DANOWhat the hell are you doing?

Dano shifts in his seat and sees - a Highway Pat rol Car ominously
cruising up the shoulder of the onramp. He shoves a bag of weed,
along with the joint, down his pants.DANOFive-O's coming!   Let's fucking
              roll, man!

Officer Thomas Burke stops the car behind them.FRANKIEJesus Christ! Here he comes!
              Move!KIMBERLYNo!   We'll all die if we do!

The cop turns on his FLASHERS.DANOI told you she'd ruin everything!SHAINAShut up, Dano, just stay cool.
                     (to Kimberly)
              He's just stoned.

Officer Thomas Burke exits his car and approaches the passenger side
of the SUV, hand on weapon. Thomas taps the window with his knuckle.THOMASWhat's going on here?KIMBERLY(incoherent, through
                           tears)
               There's going to be a pile up.
               Logs. Bodies everywhere. I saw it
               happen. It happened.

Thomas looks to the guys in back who shrug, "we don't know her."THOMASMiss, please step out of the
               vehicle.

As she does, Thomas discretely unsnaps his holster. RORY nervously
eyes the action. Sneaks a paper bundle into his sock. ISABELLA, the
pregnant woman in the White Van, gets out. She gives Thomas her
friendliest smile, milking the pregnant belly.ISABELLAExcuse me, but is there some way we
               could just drive around? I have a
               delivery.

Her CELL PHONE RINGS and she leans back inside to answer it.ISABELLAHey hon, you got a mysterious
               caller on the answering machine
               from Planned Parenthood. What's
               going on?

As she listens, growing agitated, the Harley Rider dismounts and
pulls off his helmet. Revealing EUGENE DIX, 35, a nebbishy school
teacher in cool leathers.INSIDE PACERNORA watches the SUV, distressed.NORAWhat on Earth are they doing?TIM(picking up two Naya
                           bottles)
               Who am I, David Blane?

Nora gives Tim a hard stare, then they both break into smiles. Nora
tousles his hair. And doesn't stop.TIM(good-natured laughter)
             Okay, quit it already.

As he laughs, something pains his jaw and he winces. THOMAS isn't
quite sure what kind of insanity he's dealing with yet. Dano and
Frankie, no help, stare dead ahead.KIMBERLY(trying to calm herself)
             The radio played the same songs,
             the old lady's bag broke the exact
             same way it did in my premonition.

Kimberly erupts into a panic when she sees the LOG TRUCK speed past.
She grabs at Thomas for emphasis.KIMBERLYTHAT's the truck that's going to
             kill everyone!THOMASAlright miss, calm down. I just
             need this lane open. I need you to
             pull your vehicle onto the
             shoulder!KIMBERLYYou're not listening to me!   You
             have to do something!

EVAN impatiently yells out the window of his TRANS AM.EVANArrest this whack-job, wouldja?
              Some of us have lives, y'know.

Kimberly looks to Shaina for support, but even Shaina can't meet her
eyes.KIMBERLYWhy won't anyone listen to me?

Thomas, subtly reaching for his cuffs.THOMASI'm not going to tell you to calm
             down again --

A SERIES OF CRASHES AND EXPLOSIONS ARE HEARD. In the distance. It's
neverending. Horrific. Kimberly's face crumbles. She screams in

Nora pulls a reluctant Tim out of the room. As she opens the door,
the others watch Detective Suby and Thomas appear from nowhere to
calm her down . When the door swings shut, an awkward silence.
Suddenly, the door opens again and Thomas leads Mr. Burroughs inside.
Mr. Burroughs sees Kimberly and chokes back tears.MR. BURROUGHSKimberly...

appears in the darkness, carrying a brand new television with some
packages on top. He's unable to s ee the long rickety stairwell he
climbs.

The stairs are littered with Chinese take out MENUS and a TONKA TRUCK
apparently left by some kids.

As Evan slowly climbs the staircase, a FAT MAN comes down, forcing
Evan to lean against -

THE RAILING - which CREAKS and BENDS. After the FAT MAN passes, Evan
slowly continues up again, TEARING HIS SHIRT on a nail.EVANMotherfucker.A HEATING DUCT CLICKS ON. The air blows a TONKA TRUCK slowly toward
the center of the staircase, directly in Evan's path - but Evan just
misses it!

He continues past MORE TOYS, nearing the top stair -

The Airduct coughs, sending menus fluttering toward Evan's feet and
he slips on them! He juggles the TV - but ultimately rights himself
and continues down the hallway.INT. EVAN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUSDim, cheap, probably roach-infested. As Evan enters, the small
packages fall off the TV box and onto the floor.

Evan places the TV by the door, looks at his torn shirt, but fuck it,
who cares; he's on a natural high. He peels his shirt off, revealing
his PIERCED NIPPLES, flicks on the radio and DANCES his way over to
the fridge and grabs a drink.

In the tiny kitchenette area, a small swarm of flies hovers over a
grease-filled frying pan.

Evan recoils, throws open the window and throws the grease to the
sidewalk five stories below. An ominous BREEZE enters --

And a kitchen cabinet slowly BLOWS OPEN. Some FORKS and KNIVES slide
forward on poorly stacked plates. Daring to fall into the toaster.

Evan spills some cooking oil on the range while pouring it into the
frying pan, then dumps in some frozen mozzarella sticks. Evan puts
the frying pan on the stove and turns it on HIGH.

He then grabs a container of CHINESE FOOD and rests it on the counter
next to the fridge. On the fridge, several colorful MAGNETS spell outHEY E.PUSH IN on the H - which mysteriously drops into the Chinese food -
the word EY E remaining. Oblivious, Evan puts the food in the
microwave and turns it on.ANGLE ON STOVEThe cooki ng oil creeps toward the range... Evan hits PLAY on his
answering machine and rushes across the room to tear open his
packages...VOICE (O.S.)Dude! You suck! You buy one
              fucking ticket in your whole life
              and win twenty grand? We're going

A CLICK, then hold MUZAK: AC/DC's HIGHWAY TO HELL.ANGLE ON MAGNET in Chinese fo od. SPARKING. It pops and fizzles. And
ugly sound.

As many similar messages continue, Evan unwraps a new ROLEX! He
slides it over his wrist, admiring it.ANGLE ON KNIFELazily sliding off the shelf and into the toaster, protruding about
an inch and a half. Hardly noticeable.

By now, Evan has opened the next package; a gaudy gold and diamond
encrusted horseshoe ring.

He carries the ring into the kitchenette, sees the Chinese food is
FLAMING, and his hands flash out to turn it off -- A SMALL EXPLOSION
from the microwave startles him.

The RING falls into his drain/garbage disposal!EVANDamn it!

Evan reaches INTO THE DRAIN, his fingers searching for the ring. When
he tries to pull his hand back out, the ROLEX CATCHES.

Another small EXPLOSION from the microwave, this one cracking the
GLASS. A Solo Plastic Cup nearby begins to melt.

Flames sputter around the rim of the frying pan. In moments, the oil
from the pan IGNITES. A small fire.

Evan sees all this and YANKS with all his might. No use. As the FIRE
slowly spreads to nearby cereal boxes, Evan starts to panic. He
continues yanking... Stuck.

He sees a bottle of PALMOLIVE on the other end of the counter. His
fingers reach for it.

Slightly out of his grasp. But his fingertips are just long enough to
knock the bottle backwards - where it rests against TWO SWITCHES.

The FIRE ALARM goes off. The PHONE RINGS.

Evan desperately lifts his leg and tries to use his foot to edge the
Palmolive over. By pushing the bottle up against the wall, it
threatens to turn on one of the switches.ANGLE ON FINGERSIn the GARBAGE DISPOSAL. A SWITCH is flipped - but the light goes on.
And the Palmolive lazily falls, resting on the remaining switch.EVANCome on, come on...

Evan makes one last push with his foot - accidently flipping the
SWITCH - the GARBAGE DISPOSAL GRINDS METAL!

Evan, horrified, miraculously yanks his hand free, brushing against
the knife in the toaster.

When the SHOCK goes through Evan's body, his other hand jerks out,
knocking the flaming frying pan to the floor.

The entire kitchen is in flames, including the new TV blocking the
door. The window slams SHUT! The room fills with smoke.EVANJesus Christ!

Evan grabs a fire extinguisher. A mere dribble of foam comes out. He
begins COUGHING in the smoke.

Evan tries the window - STUCK! He has no choice but to smash the
kitchenette window with the fire extinguisher to get to the fire
escape.

He dr ops the fire extinguisher, starts to climb out the window, hears
a creak and looks up just as --

A large jagged shard of glass comes CRASHING down at him -- Evan
jumps back just in time as it shatters before him. The fire
completely engulfs the kitchen.

He bravely jumps through the window pane, landing on the fire escape.
He runs down the fire escape from floor to floor.

A LARGE BLAST from his window showers him with glass and brick
shrapnel, but ultimately, he makes it to the fire escape's lowest
level, intact.

He tries to lower the rusty metal ladder to the ground. It budges
once, then twice, but won't go down. So he climbs over the railing
and gently drops to the ground.

Safe and sound, he breathes a sigh of relief and turns to walk --

SUDDENLY he s lips on the very grease he threw out the window, his
legs shoot out from under him and he lands on his back.

The rusty ladder suddenly dislodges and hurls downward -- coming
right for Evan's face -- but stops halfway!

As Evan laughs, breathing a final sigh of relief, it suddenly
PLUMMETS again -- impaling Evan through his eye socket!INT. POLICE STATION - COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHTThomas sits at the computer terminal. He checks to make sure no one's

the way the victims died. As Thomas begins a localized search of the
word, "PREMONITION" --

her inner sanctum. A mattress on the floor, a plastic bottle of
water, some paperbacks and a bedpan.

Kimberly's jaw drops when she sees the far wall: a SHRINE to flight

At once, Clear, enraged, is in her face, speaking through clenched
teeth.CLEARMy family is dead.   My friends are

Clear angrily peels a Polaroid off the wall and shows it to Kimberly.
While we don't see the photo, Kimberly's horrified face paints a
gruesome picture on its own.CLEARAnd yes, that's the blade of a
             fucking ceiling fan in his head.

opens the door. Kimberly, devastated, turns to leave, then summons
her courage and turns back to Clear.KIMBERLYKnow what? I think you're a
             coward. I think you hide out in

Kimberly nods, ever creeping closer to the front door -- when
AUTOMATIC LIGHTS FLASH from over the garage.

All three freeze for a moment, during which we hear STOMPING emanate
from within the house, and the lights SHUT OFF.

But nothing else happens. No one comes to a door. Thomas sighs, and
as if suddenly remembering his status, he walks fearlessly and
purposefully to the front door.

He makes a fist, is about to knock - when the DOOR FLINGS OPEN and a
ROTTWEILER LUNGES for his throat - only to have its collar snagged at
the last second by its owner -

The Rottweiler cowers, and Jorge shoves it to the floor, where it
lands on its feet and fearfully trots away. Jorge's face is once
again pleasant, but it's a thin veneer.

through the house, into a bedroom and sees -

the floor to reveal a YOUNG WOMAN, naked, trembling with fear, takes
a closer look at Clear.YOUNG WOMANWe never meant to hurt you

jump out and run towards the blast site.KIMBERLYYou can't cheat destiny. I know
                what I have to do to save us. I
                have to die.THOMASThat's crazy. You can't give up
                now. We can still fight this
                thing.

But Kimberly isn't listening. She stares through the glass doors at
the --AMBULANCEA red stripe down the side, but the hood is completely white. Six
floral scented air-fresheners hang from the rearview. The 'van' from
her vision! And it's running!KIMBERLYI have to do this.

Kimberly wipes tears from her eyes, kisses Thomas' cheek, then turns
and runs before he can speak.EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUSKimberly heads right for the open ambulance. The driver's door almost
seems to swing open for her as she gets in.INT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUSThomas frantically tries to get through the electric doors, which
SPARK and short out. He struggles to pry them apart.EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUSKimberly shifts into gear and speeds off. Thomas squeezes through the
doors and runs after her. An EMT, the driver of the stolen ambulance,
rushes outside.EMTWhat the fuck?!EXT. LAKE - DAYThomas chases the ambulance, watching helplessly as it barrels over
curbs, pylons and a fence, ultimately plunging straight into the
lake!

Thomas sprints to the lake as fast as he can - the EMT trailing far
behind.INSIDE THE AMBULANCEKimberly panics as the ambulance fills with water and she takes a
final gasp of air --ON THE LAKE'S EDGEThomas stares in horror at the percolating air bubbles as the vehicle
descends below the surface -- and he dives in!UNDERWATERThomas swims into the dark, murky water. Deeper and deeper, he g ets
to the ambulance and tries to open the door. Stuck. He withdraws his
baton and BANGS on the glass - nothing!

He tries coming up for air, but his pants snag on the jagged metal of
the twisted bumper. He squirms frantically...

And as his exhausted body loses consciousness, everything --FADE TO BLACK.INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAYBLACKNESS.DR. KALARJIAN (O.S.)Ready and...CLEAR!

The SHOCK of defribulator paddles brings Kimberly back to life.KIMBERLY'S POVLooking up at Dr. Kalarjian, all she can see is part of a woman's
face and a partial nametage reading "Kalarjian".

It would appear as if she's choking Kimberly, but --

An EEG MONITOR turns from a flatline to a steady heartbeat, the same
POV as the premonition.NURSEShe's back!DR. KALARJIANFive CC's of narcodon. I want her
                 stabilized and prepped for ICU.

Kimberly turns her head to seeTHOMASUnconscious, CPR being performed on him by the EMT (who's now soaking
wet). Thomas doesn't respond.

An INTERN opens an eyelid, points a flashlight at his eyes. Shakes
his head, nothing. The sopping wet EMT goes back to performing CPR.

Finally, Thomas coughs up water, chokes, gasps for air, then BOLTSUPRIGHT.THOMASKimberly?!

He turns to see Kimberly reaching out for him. Immeasurably relieved,
he takes her hand and allows himself to be eased back down to the
platform. Kimberly's eyes fill with tears.KIMBERLY(whispering)
             Welcome back. We did it.           For
             real.THOMASI know.   I can feel it too.

Outside, a parting of dark clouds causes a shaft of sunlight to flood
into the hospital. Its light covers Kimberly and Thomas with an
ethereal glow. There are no more doubts; they've won.

They exchange meek, yet triumphant smiles in the smoky, chaotic
hospital.SLOW DISSOLVE TO:EXT. PARK - DAYWe are at a summer barbecue. Frisbee, lawn darts, croquet, et.
Everyone's happy.TITLE CARD: FIVE MONTHS LATERANGLE ONShish -Kabob entering a mouth.REVEALKimberly taking a bite, relishing the taste and calmly pulling the
metal skewer from her mouth.KIMBERLYMy God, this is delicious. I can't
              believe I used to be a vegan.

Thomas, out of uniform, takes a bite of his own. As the metal skewer
is deep in his mouth --

A running FRISBEE PLAYER accidentally bumps into Thomas! But no harm.
Thomas gives the guy a friendly pat and goes back to rewrapping his
mouth around the shish-kabob.MR. BURROUGHS (O.S.)So what's the deal, Thomas? Three
              months and you still haven't asked
              my daughter out on a date.

Kimberly turns red as Mr. Burroughs appears and takes a seat.THOMASWhat's wrong with a platonic
              relationship?MR. GIBBONSPlatonic my ass. That's for ugly
              women.KIMBERLYFor God's sake, leave him alone,

                          voice)
              Besides, if you can beat Death,what's he got to worry about me
             for?

Mr. Gibbons sits down at the table with two plates of food. His wife,
MRS. GIBBONS, joins.MR. GIBBONSYou know, you still never explained
             to us how you did it.

It seems by now everyone's familiar with the concept.THOMASWell, technically when we died, we
             gave Death what it wanted. And by
             the time we were revived, it had
             already moved on to graver
             pastures.

Mrs. Gibbons makes a face, finding the discourse distasteful. She
changes the conversation.MRS. GIBBONSYou know, I'm having the greatest
             day?KIMBERLYFood's great too, Mrs. Gibbons.

A chorus of friendly laughter.BRIAN (O.S.)Dad used to call her the
             pincushion. From Hellraiser.

BRIAN enters frame, soaking up fresh laughter. He holds a plate full
of raw chicken fillets and some long, wooden matches.BRIANDad, you had the spatula last,
               right?MR. GIBBONSSure, here.

Mr. Gibbons hands it over and Brian saunters away from camera,
SLIGHTLY OUT OF FOCUS, toward the barbecue, his body framed between
Kimberly and Thomas' heads.KIMBERLYBrian looks like he's having fun.MR. GIBBONSSure does. Owes it to that friend
               of yours, in a way.

Mr. Gibbons immediately regrets having said that.KIMBERLYHow's that?MR. GIBBONSWell, Brian was nearly hit by an
               ambulance the day...but your friend
               Rory pulled him back at the last
               second.

Kimberly and Thomas ominously turn their heads around. In the BG,
Brian fidgets in front of the barbecue.MRS. GIBBONSYou never told me that, Peter.
               Boy, that was lucky.

BOOM!!! The PROPANE TANK blows Brian to smithereens. A deafening
silence follows, punctuated when Brian's ARM lands on Mrs. Gibbons'
plate. PLOP.FADE TO BLACK.END CREDITS.
