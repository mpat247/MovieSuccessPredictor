The bee having popped his balloons, Seymour falls to
the ground below, where he comically falls into a
barrel and begins floating down a pink lemonade river.SSSHere we are, April Valley. Where all the magic
happens. Easter magic that is. And everybody's getting
                ready for the big day!MUSIC BREAK: INTRO SONGELROYGood news, sir...ANTOINEPeteeeeer!PETERHuh, what? Antoine, Call maintenance. A lever on the
             control panel is missing.ANTOINERight away sir!ELROYMr. Cottontail, our productivity is up over one
  tenth of one percent over the last three days.PETERSo that's...   good?ELROYYes sir, that's good.PETERAnd we'll be ready for Easter?ELROYBy a whisker. I really had to light a fire under
             that marshmallow cream...PETER(gasps) Light a fire?!ELROYIt's just a figure of speech sir.PETER(sniffs air)ELROYUhh... fire! Fiiire!PETERDon't worry everyone, it's just a figure of speech.ELROYNo, FIRE!

Peter grabs a fire extinguisher and uses it to skate
down to the fire like a badass. He puts out the
fire.PETERNow! Who was supposed to be watching the nougat?
            Come on, somebody speak up.FACTORY WORKERActually sir, a lot of us have been wondering...PETER...yes?FACTORY WORKERWhat is nougat?PETERNougat. You know, it's-it's nougat, it's fluffy.
   It's chewy, it's partially hydroge-- hey, wait a
   minute. I want a name! who's responsible? Elroy?
                 who's responsible?ELROYDon't make me say, sir, please. It'll only make you
                      angry.PETEROh no. It was Junior... JUNIOR!!!!SSSSounds like Junior's in a little bit of trouble.
   Don't worry about the nougat, they made more.

Cut to: a grassy field, where Peter Cottontail
Junior is showing his friends one of his new
inventions.JRLadies and gentlemen! For generations, Easter
 bunnies have delivered eggs the old-fashioned way:
hopping down ye olde bunny trail. Today friends, we
   welcome the FUTURE. I give you Peter Cottontail
Junior's supercharged Easter basket speed shooter!CHUNKWooooow!SOPHIECool!JUNIORLet's make bunny history.

He shoots, he splats.SOPHIEOr we could make an omelet.CHUNKAwesome! Can we do me next?JUNIORThe problem must be an imbalance between the drag
      coefficient and the lift coefficient.CHUNKW--what's that mean?JUNIORNo idea.SOPHIEMaybe that's the problem?PETERJunior!SOPHIEGotta hop! He's so busted!PETERWhew! (clears throat) Now. Junior. you missed all
     the excitement down at the candy factory.JUNIORI think you're the one missing the excitement Dad.
Check this out-- it's a little something I call... the
                      future.PETERThe future looks kind of icky, son.JUNIOROkay, needs some work.PETERLet's talk about work. Like watching the nougat
                      vat.JUNIORWhat is nougat anyway?PETERNougat, you know it's nougat! It's fluffy, it's
chewy, it's partially hydrogenated-- it's the stuff
 you were supposed to be watching, but because you
           weren't, it caught on fire!JUNIOROh. That nougat.PETER(sigh) Why does it seem like wherever you go,
  trouble is always hopping behind 1    qyou?JUNIORGive me one example!PETERLet's see, there was the automatic basket weaving

games. Have I ever told you the story of Irontail?PETER AND JUNIOR (TOGETHER)His evil trickery almost ruined Easter forever...PETERHave I told you this before?JUNIOROnce or twice.PETERHe and I were bitter enemies! and--JUNIOR(interrupting) Dad, that Iron Tail story is ancient
              history, get over it!PETERUghhh. Okay, I just hope you never have to learn
 about him the hard way. Now pick up your toys and

fine without your... improvements. Now don't keep your

time, Junior. Paint the eggs as slooow as possible,

New scene. We see a wintery town. Close up on a little
human girl looking out of her window.SSSOutside of April Valley the world is wrapped in
winter, and kids everywhere are more than ready for
                      Spring.HUMAN GIRLMom, will winter ever be over?HUMAN MOMWe'll know spring is coming when Jack Frost's window
    paintings melt away! So it might be a while.

Suddenly there is a super sexy blue lady floating past
the window, just out of view of the humans.JACKIEJack Frost? Darling please. Dear old Jack is so last
                     century.

She uses her magical ice powers to make the window
frostier.JACKIEThe names Jackie, Jackie Frost. Write it down.

Suddenly a ray of sun shines through a cloud,
melting the icy window.JACKIEArgh! Infernal sunshine ruining another masterpiece!

Jackie whistles and a flying car, driven by a
penguin, pulls up in midair. She gets in.JACKIEHome, fish breath. And this time no stopping for
                    squid tacos.

Cut to: the Cottontail home. Peter and Mrs.
Cottontail are making dinner.PETERWhy is he in such a hurry to improve everything?MRS. COTTONTAILHe takes after you, Peter, he's impatient!PETERHe's got to slow down a little. A Bunny's got a walk
                 before he can hop.MRS. COTTONTAILIf you were his age and all you got to do was pull
   weeds and watch pots boil, you'd try to change
                     things too.PETERHey, at his age--MRS. COTTONTAILNot with your mouth full.PETER(swallows) At his age, I was responsible!MRS. COTTONTAILRight, responsible for goofing off, sleeping late,
              dreaming the day away...PETERExactly-- hey!MRS. COTTONTAILPeter, give Junior some real responsibility! He's
 not a little kid anymore. There must be something
              you could have him do.PETERWell, of course it... No...yeah-- yeah! I got it!

Cut to a clock tower on a hill. Peter and Junior are
walking towards it.JUNIORYou have got to be kidding. I'm supposed to get
          excited about cleaning a clock?PETERSon, this is the clock of Spring, one of the four
      clocks of the seasons Father Time made.

            PETER AND JUNIOR (together)
  Without the four clocks, the seasons would never
                      change.PETER...never...change. Have I told you this before?JUNIOROnce or twice. But Dad, just polishing the outside?PETERAnd inside. Polishing the most important part, the
                  spring of Spring.JUNIORYeah but, can't I, you know, trick it out a little?
    take it from analog to digital, slap on some
subwoofers, really make the bass tones pop? (starts
                    beatboxing)PETERNo nonono, no improving, no trick outing, no
upgrading. Look, what I'm about to give you is very,
very big. Huge, huge. The big time! It-- it literally
   is time and it's very big. It's the big time.JUNIORWhat was that?PETERNothing. Here we go.

With reluctance, Peter hands Junior the key to the
all-important clock of Spring, putting the power to
control the weather in the hands of his adolescent
son.JUNIORYou're giving me the key to the clock of Spring?PETERUh... yeah. Don't lose it. Obviously, right? And do
 not-- do not leave the case unlocked! If anything
                      happens--JUNIOR(interrupting) I know, I'm responsible!PETERYes, that is absolutely right, I'm counting on you,
  son. (Peter walks away) Good, he's responsible.
       Okay. Yup, this is good... Real good.

Unseen, an evil-looking bat watches the two from
atop the clock tower.MONTRESOR(chuckles evilly)
 Interior, Jackie's ice palace. She is standing next
to an ice chaise with penguin guards and butlers
holding icy drinks on a tray.JACKIEI've had enough! I can't bear to watch that awful
sun melt away another one of my masterpieces! I wish
         there were no such thing as spring.MUSIC BREAK: ICE LIFEJACKIEWhy can't it be winter all year long?IRONTAILPerhaps I can help?JACKIEGuards! Intruder! Identify yourself.IRONTAILThe name's Tail. Irontail. (make metal tail noise)JACKIEIrontail! Like Irontail Irontail?IRONTAILIn the fur.JACKIEAnd what brings you to my frozen paradise, my metal-
                  tushied friend?IRONTAILWhat if I told you that I have a way to make sure
             Spring never comes again?JACKIEHmm. I'd wonder what's in it for you.IRONTAILRevenge. Peter Cottontail stole my job. If I can't
be the Easter Bunny then I'll make sure that Easter
                 never comes again.JACKIEHmmm. You've got my full attention.IRONTAILGood. Now then... There's this clock in April
                       Valley...

Cut to the clock of Spring. Junior is outside,
absorbed in his catapult.JUNIORReady, aim, and happy easter!.......Hmm. Improved
   velocity, decreased accuracy. Highly unusual.IRONTAILOne more time, what's the plan?JACKIESshh. Get in, get the spring, get out!JUNIORExcuse me, but you're not supposed to be here.IRONTAIL(to Jackie) No magic, you'll give us away. I'll take
 care of this. (to Junior) Bless my whiskers, don't
  tell me! you're the very picture of your father,
                 Peter Cottontail.JUNIORI'm sorry, do I know you?IRONTAILOh dear boy, I grew up here. But I've been far away,
 and I've brought some friends to see dear old April
                        Valley.JACKIESay freeze! (snaps photo)JUNIORThose are some strange-looking bunnies, and, whoa,
  that is one very fluffy tail, mister... um...?IRONTAILDon't tell me, a new egg delivery system?JUNIORIt's just a prototype, really.IRONTAILBrilliant! So original! Of course, new ideas aren't
     really appreciated around here, are they?JUNIORNo! I mean-- hey, how did you know?IRONTAILOh you could say we're two of a kind, you and I.
     Inventors, innovators, unappreciated by the
riffraff. Oh, I can see when a bright young bunny is
     being cheated out of his chance to shine.JUNIORYou can?

Meanwhile inside the clock, the penguins are trying
to steal the spring, but failing comically.JUNIORMy dad never listens to me. He just wants to do
 things the same old way they've always been done.IRONTAILYour father understands so very little. Now show me
              how this marvel works.JACKIEUgh! Do I have to do everything myself?

She shoots an ice ray, freezing all the clock's
inner works.JUNIOR...and then you have to adjust the tension on the
          spring. Too much tension is bad.IRONTAILYou're telling me.

Inside the clock tower, Jackie conjures a crowbar
made of ice and dislodges the spring.JUNIOR...But it's got to have enough thrust to get your
payload where it's going! ...I'm still working on--SOPHIEHey, Junior! The calendar day ceremony's about to
                      start!CHUNKHurry up, Spring's comin'!JUNIORBut I gotta finish up here!SOPHIEWell... we don't want to be late.CHUNKHow about we save you a place?JUNIORWait, guys!IRONTAILDon't worry, Junior, I'll finish polishing the
                      clock.JUNIORYou will?IRONTAILWith pleasure.JUNIORUm... you're gonna need this.

Junior hands Irontail the shiny key to the clock.JUNIORThanks. Hey guys, wait up!IRONTAILPolishing it off that is... (evil laugh) Oh you'll
bring big changes to April Valley all right, Junior.
                  Big, big changes.

The chauffeur penguin pulls up, they all hop in
Jackie's car and ride away evilly.
...Cut to new scene: All the bunnies are gathered in
the town center for the calendar day ceremony!PETERWelcome friends, to another happy calendar day!JUNIORWhoops, excuse me! Comin' through! That's my dad.PETERNow, how about we all say goodbye to March, and
                  hello to April!

Drumroll. Peter rips off the calendar page that says
thirty one to reveal... thirty two!!??? The crowd
gasps as the sky darkens.ELROYMarch thirtysecond? Theeeeeere's no such thing as
                March thirtysecond!PETERWh..Wha-?

Peter rips off another page of the calendar.BUNNY IN CROWD #1March thirty third?

Peter keeps ripping, but the numbers just keep going
higher. The month of March has become infinite.BUNNY IN CROWD #2March fifty first? Hey Cottontail, is this some kind
                      of joke?ANTOINEPeter, March is not ending!PETERWell, I can see that.ANTOINEWhat has happened to ze April?PETERI don't understand it, Antoine! Elroy!

A thunderclap. Storm clouds gather.ELROYI've never seen anything quite like this. I don't
          know what could have happened.PETERUnless...... Juniorrr!
 Junior has broken away from the crowd and in a panic
is sprinting up to the clock tower, panting heavily.JUNIOR(heavy breathing... even more heaving breathing) Oh,
  Dad... I'm sorry. the key! Where did I put the key?
                 (more heavy breathing)

He comes upon the icy clock and rushes inside. His
worst fears are confirmed: the spring of Spring is
missing! He screams.JUNIORAah!

He runs back out into the storm.JUNIOR(lots of ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)

Cut to: Junior, alone in his dark kitchen, writing on
a piece of paper.JUNIORDear Mom and Dad, this is all my fault. I made a
mistake. Now I've got to try to make things right. I
       hope you can forgive me, love, Junior.PETER(reading) ---love, Junior. I shouldn't have been so
                    tough on him.ELROYSir, it's the factory. The rain is causing a flood.PETERElroy, you. You're in charge of the factory.MRS. COTTONTAILPeter?PETERAntoine, you come with me. We're going to find
                      Junior!

It's dark and raining hard. Peter and Antoine are
standing on a bridge, over the formerly pink river.PETERYa see him?ANTOINENo Peter, I don't see him. Then again I'm three
          inches off ze ground. Hurry up!

Lightning strikes the bridge and it breaks in half,
stranding the two on opposite sides of the river.PETERAntoine! I can't get across!ANTOINENever fear, Peter. I will find your boy. I will
bring him back. I will not fail. I swear it upon my
 honor as a caterpillar, and a citizen of France!
         Don't step on me anyone! I'm off!

New scene. Interior, ice palace. Jackie, Irontail,
the penguins, and Montresor the bat are all dancing
around to some sick techno music for slightly too
 long. Jackie and Irontail are getting slightly too
close for a children's movie.JACKIEPenguins! Make my slightly mangy friend here a
                       drink.IRONTAILA toast!JACKIETo the end of Spring. But wait! Even without Spring
   there's still Summer, and that's even worse!IRONTAILThen why stop with Spring? We could just keep going,
                    you and I.JACKIEPut Summer on ice?IRONTAILAnd put the freeze on Fall?JACKIEI see the start of a beautiful partnership. Frost
                  and Irontail.IRONTAILI think Irontail and Frost has a certain ring to it.JACKIEHow did you come by that, um, that--IRONTAILRiveted rump? Chrome caboose? Platinum posterior?JACKIEYeah, that.IRONTAILOnce upon a time, it was a lovely puff of a tail.
 And then a careless, hateful little child ran over
 it with his roller skates and lopped it clean off.
 And ever since that day, I have had to wear this.JACKIESo you weren't always Irontail? What was your name
                   before that?IRONTAILUh... I-I don't remember.JACKIEIf we're going to be partners, you have to be honest
 with me. Even if we're going to be evil partners.IRONTAILI-It's really not that important.

A penguin whispers something into Jackie's ear.JACKIEIt's... Fluffy? (cackles)PENGUINS(laugh)IRONTAILI knew you were all going to laugh.JACKIENo no no, it's a fine name... Fluffy. We're going for
     a ride. Come along now penguins... Fluffy!PENGUINS(laughter)

Cut to a new, unfamiliar land. Our hero begins his
journey.JUNIOR(heavy breathing)FLUTTERLook ooooouuuuut!

A robin falls out of the sky and collides directly
with Junior.FLUTTEROoow, you hurt my beak!JUNIORWhat? You crashed into me!FLUTTERAnd my feathers! You definitely scratched my
                     feathers!JUNIORNow wait, you just--FLUTTERAnd I itch now! Oh great, I think you gave me lice.JUNIORLice!?MAMA ROBINMy baby!!! What have you done to him? What were you
thinking? He's molting, he's smaller than the other
        birds, and you done gave him lice?JUNIORActually, ma'am, he crashed into me.MAMA ROBINAnd you! Don't you know rabbits can give you lice?
     ...So, dear, are you new to Summer Hill?JUNIORYes, ma'am. I'm here from April Valley.

        FLUTTER AND MAMA ROBIN (together)
                 April Valley!?MAMA ROBINYou a little far from home... aren't you?FLUTTERWhat are you doing here?JUNIORI don't have time to explain. I have to find the
              clock of summer. Fast!MAMA ROBINDon't worry baby, Flutter will show you the way.FLUTTERMama!MAMA ROBINDon't you mama me. You better mind your Summer Hill
 manners. Now, you crashed into this boy, so you're
     gonna go on, and you're gonna show him some
hospitality. Now I'm going to sit on your brother.JUNIORHuh?FLUTTERHe's still in the egg.JUNIORThat makes more sense.

Jump to, Junior and Flutter hurrying toward the
clock of summer. But the sky is already darkening.JUNIOR...and I think they're gonna try to do the same
 thing to the clock of summer that they did to the
                 clock of spring!FLUTTERWow.JUNIORYeah. Wow. Come on, let's go!

It's just as they feared. The clock is frozen and
dark clouds cover the sky. In a watermelon patch
beneath the clock, strange, muffled noises can be
heard.CHIPMUNKHalp!...halp!...(struggle noises)

A frenzied chipmunk bursts forth from inside a
watermelon.CHIPMUNKThey jumped me from behind! They stole the sun of
   summer from inside the clock! Now summer won't
                       come!FLUTTERListen, I gotta get home.CHIPMUNKThe flowers won't flower!FLUTTERMy mom is calling,CHIPMUNKThe melons won't melon!FLUTTERSo I'm out of here.CHIPMUNKThe vegetables won't vegetate!FLUTTERSee ya!CHIPMUNKAnd eggs won't hatch!
 Flutter stops in his tracks, aghast. Now it's
personal.
...Cut back to April Valley, where snow is falling
from an icy sky.ELROYThe cold weather's making things difficult
     throughout our operations, sir. You see, the
  chickens can't lay eggs, the chocolate is frozen
solid, and the nougat, sir, well the nougat...don't--
   don't make me explain it, I can't describe it.PETER(exasperated) Any sign of Junior yet?ELROYUnfortunately, sir, no.PETERI'm counting on you, Antoine.

Meanwhile, Antoine is wriggling as fast as he can
through a dark and cloudy summer hill.ANTOINE(panting) Don't worry, Junior, I am on my way! Just
                      sit tight.

We cut to a new place with harmonica music and
cornstalks. A family of mice is scrounging for corn
cobs.MUNCH(grunting) Okay, don't anyone help me!PAPA MOUSEMunch, honey, leave it! There's nothing left.MUNCHMaybe we could just lick it.

Suddenly a hungry looking cat appears.MUNCH(gulps)PAPA MOUSERun for your lives!MAMA MOUSEMove it!MUNCHWhat is it with cats anyhow? Why don't you open a
                 can or something?

Munch scurries behind some cornstalks and the cat
passes her by. She appears safe.MUNCH(panting) Just once I'd like to see the view from a
           few links up the food chain.

Just then we hear a raptor screech. A hawk swoops
down and grabs Munch with its talons!MUNCHAah!HAWKGotcha.MUNCHAah! (Gasps) Oh my gosh. Help!JUNIORHey did you hear that?FLUTTERNo.MUNCHHelp!JUNIORWell did you hear that?FLUTTERNo. I did not hear that cry for help.

The hawk swoops down low, flying right overhead.MUNCHHel-lo!JUNIOROkay, tell me you heard that.FLUTTERUh, no?MUNCHHelp!...Help!JUNIORWell go on, go on! you're the one with the wings!FLUTTERFine, I'm going already. You're worse than my
                        mother.

Flutter flits up into the sky and approaches the hawk
with hesitation.MUNCHIt's about time!FLUTTERHey, what you got there?HAWKLunch.FLUTTERYou gonna eat that? Grrrross.MUNCHI'm not food!FLUTTEROkay, you asked for it...Robin attack!

 Flutter and the hawk begin an epic chase through the
 trees.MUNCHGet your big claws off of me! Aaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!

 Tiny Flutter bonks the hawk on the head repeatedly.HAWKBack off, bon bon.FLUTTERDrop it! Drop the mouse!MUNCHYeah!...No. No dropping! No dropping! No
            droooooooooooooooooo-.......FLUTTERIncomiiiing!MUNCHaaaAAHHHH...oof!

A quick-thinking Junior catches Munch.JUNIORGotcha!FLUTTERLook ooouuuut!JUNIORNot again.

          FLUTTER & JUNIOR (simultaneous)
                       Oof!FLUTTERHey, thanks for breaking my fall.JUNIORDon't... mention it.

They both look over to Munch, who is laying on the
ground, eyes closed. Is she dead?MUNCH...He gone?JUNIORYeah.MUNCHNice catch. where'd you get your pilot's license,
                off a birdseed box?FLUTTERYou're welcome.JUNIORLet's go, flutter.MUNCHHey, you guys hungry?JUNIORSorry. We have an appointment with the clock of
                        Fall.FLUTTERActually I do need to eat regular periodic small
                       meals.MUNCHCome on. I know where we can get something good!

Munch leads them to a tree with juicy apples. Flutter
flies up, tries, and fails to pull one off the tree.JUNIOROkay, plan B.

In an epic montage, Junior brilliantly combines a
board, fulcrum, and rock, making him the inventor of
simple machines. He jumps on the board, launching
the rock. It hits the apple but bounces off, hitting
Junior in the face, likely giving him lifelong brain
damage.JUNIORFigures. My ideas never work.

Magically, the apple falls on its own and rolls over
to Munch, who takes a satisfied bite.MUNCHAaaah. So! Where we off to now?

Cut to a dark and stormy Summer Hill. Antoine the
french caterpillar has come upon the clock, and
underneath it, a burst open watermelon.ANTOINEZere was a struggle here...[sniffs] there were three
penguins...in prosthetic ears!and one slightly mangy
    bunny... [sniffs] a gopher...no! a chipmunk! was
 imprisoned...in a papaya...no no! a watermelon... I
        love watermelon! my quest...continues!

Cut back to our newly formed trio, who are journeying
through the forest of Fall Falls.MUNCHI told you, all I needed was a little pick-me-up!
           Hurry up, we're almost there!

The clock comes into view. Four penguins and a bat are
teetering in front of it, stacked high in order to
reach the clock face and remove the leaf of Fall.JUNIOR(girly gasp)

Junior whips his head around to see Irontail and
Jackie Frost standing to one side, watching as their
minions do their bidding.JUNIORThose are the guys I was tellin' ya about!FLUTTERGet down!MUNCHLet me at `em!JUNIORGet down! Guys, we're only gonna get one shot at
                       this.MUNCHYou got a plan?JUNIORDo I got a plan!IRONTAILThe spring of Spring, the sun of Summer, and the
leaf of Fall. You know what this means? The seasons
   have stopped changing, and all that remains is
                      winter.JACKIEYes but, don't you think that you should let me take
           care of those little baubles?IRONTAILEase up, Jackie my dear. Stop being such a control
                       freak.JACKIEDon't call me that.IRONTAILControl freak?JACKIENo, "my dear."

Suddenly a dozen pinecones are launched into the
sky, falling around Jackie and Irontail.JACKIEWho is doing that?JUNIORThat WHO...would be me!IRONTAILCottontail...
 Temporarily distracted by a pinecone to the face,
Irontail drops the clock parts. Flutter and Munch
swoop in and grab them.IRONTAILOw! Ow!JACKIEAfter them!

Another epic chase montage. Flutter and Munch manage
to evade Jackie's ice rays and bring the items back to
their leader.FLUTTERHere, Junior!MUNCHWe did it!IRONTAILHand em over, kid.JUNIORNever! Never in a million years! Never in-- hey!IRONTAILJust like your father. Say hi to him for me. (make
                  metal tail noise)

Irontail removes the fake fluff from his butt
revealing his iron tail, shaking it around all
sassy.JUNIORIron Tail!JACKIEOh and kids? If I were you, I'd bundle up. It's
going to be a very, very cold LIFE! AAHAHAaahahaaaa!JUNIORLook, face it, we're toast.MUNCHHmm, toast? Where?!JUNIORWill you stop thinking about food?! We blew it. It's
                        over.MUNCHWell if your stupid invention worked like it was
                   supposed to...FLUTTERWell if you didn't have to eat your own weight every
                  ten minutes...MUNCHMaybe if you weren't such a chicken.FLUTTERI'm not a chicken. I'm a robin.JUNIORHere's an idea, why don't both of you just face
 facts? Ever since we met, absolutely nothing has
gone right. Your baby brother is never gonna hatch.
 Your family is never gonna have anything to eat, and
        I'll never be able to go home again.FLUTTERUh, Junior?MUNCHWhere are we?SSSOur heroes found themselves in a magical, colorful
place, Color Land! Where every color of the rainbow
   comes from....And soon they came upon the soul
 resident of Color Land, Seymour S. Sassafras! They
        should be arriving... right about now.JUNIORWho should?SSSYou should!JUNIORShould what?SSSBe arriving! And you're about to ask for my help.JUNIORAnd...do you give it to me?SSSI...I-I can't remember...Oh! Yes, yes I do. Follow
 me. And so they walked across the bridge. And Mr.
  Sassafras told him that Jackie and Irontail's plan
   was to plunge the world into permanent winter.ALL(gasp)SSSDon't worry! ...Sassafras's incredible bustproof
   bubble never bobbles! At least it hasn't yet!

Mr. Sassafras leads them to a wacky-looking
contraption that looks like a giant bubble attached
to an air pump.JUNIORThis is all my fault. Why do I spend so much time
             dreaming about tomorrow?SSSIt's important to dream about tomorrow, Junior, but
   you have to take care of today. It's a classic
               today-tomorrow problem.

They climb into the giant bubble and it begins to
rise.JUNIORBye, Mister Sassafras! Oh, by the way, how do we get
                       down?SSSNot a problem! Just pull the rip cord!FLUTTERAh, first-class travel!MUSIC BREAK: MAKE IT APPEARWe cut to Antoine, who is struggling through a
blustery Fall Falls.ANTOINEI am persisting in my quest. At this rate I will
never find the junior! Time...is my enemy. AAAhh! I
                 meant to do that!

Meanwhile, in the sky bubble, our heroes are fast
asleep.WIND[Sinister roaring noises]FLUTTERWhat was that?JUNIORI don't know!WINDRrroooaarrr!FLUTTEROk...ok...ok! Let's do somethin'! Like get out of
                       here?JUNIORMaybe if we raise the average kinetic energy
      quotient to offset the external inertia!MUNCHWhat does that mean?JUNIORIt means we gotta get out of here! Come on!

They throw themselves at the bubble's interior walls
frantically, to no avail.FLUTTERNobody tell my mama I did that.WINDRrroooaaarr!ALLAaahhhh!WINDGotcha! Ha ha ah ahaha ah! Got you good! You should
       see the looks on your faces! Hahahahaa!JUNIORWhat is the matter with you? That's no way to treat
                      people!FLUTTERDidn't your mama teach you manners?MUNCHWe're starving in here!JUNIORAnd we have to get to Winter Ridge as soon as
                     possible!WINDSorry, sirs, ma'am.MUNCHHey, maybe he could help us get there.WINDHmm, Winter Ridge? Okay now uh, that's quite a
                    distance.FLUTTERYeah, but for the north wind, one big huff could do
                     it right?WINDHa ha ha ha ha! The North wind! Hahaha! The North
wind? Is that what I look like to you? Hahahaha!JUNIORUhh I'm sorry, the Western wind?WINDAhahahahah! I guess I can't expect a bunny to know.
Heh heh heh heh. Thanks for the compliment. No, I'm
not one of these big "celebrity winds." Ga ha ha ha
                      ha ha...JUNIORBut you are a wind, right?WINDOh yeah, sure! Have you ever heard of the East by
  Southwest wind? Well, you're looking at him.MUNCHOh, great. Stuck in midair with the East by
                  Southwest wind.WINDLet's not get personal now. I could send you back
                 the other way.JUNIORNo! She's sorry Mr. Wind, sir. She gets crabby when
                   she's hungry.WINDReally? Same here!JUNIORIt's just we really need whatever help--WIND(interrupting) It's ok, it's ok, listen. I can tell
 you're good people. I'll do whatever it is I can.
                       Mmmm?JUNIORGreat! Thank you so much, Mister...WINDJust call me Wind! Get ready now! (warmup blowing
                     noises)FLUTTERThis guy couldn't blow out a birthday candle!WINDJust getting warmed up, just getting warmed up.
      Lemme try again. (more crazy noises)MUNCHI should have brought along some buffalo wings.FLUTTERWhat?!WINDHang on, hang on! I almost caught it that time. (big
                  inhale, big blow)ALLYeah! Woohoo! You did it! Etc.WINDThank you, thank you.SSSWhile our heroes tried and tried to get themselves
to Jackie Frost's fortress, April Valley looked more
               like February Valley.WIND(blowing, blowing, running out of steam...)MUNCHWe're here!WINDWhew. We are? Thank goodness, I'm a little
                 lightheaded. Whoa.JUNIORYou were awesome! I mean not quite gale-force, but--FLUTTERDefinitely kite-flying wind!WINDWhy thank you, gosh, that's nice.JUNIORNow if you could just put us down someplace safe...?WINDDown? Mmm, I don't do down. I'm a wind, not a
       downspout. Want me to call my cousin?FLUTTERMr. Sassafras said if we ever needed to get down,
               just pull the ripcord!JUNIOR(grunting noises as he jumps up to pull cord)

Junior pulls the cord, creating a hole in the top of
the bubble. They begin to plummet.ALLAaaaaaaaaaaaahh!FLUTTERAssume crash positiooooon!ALL[landing painfully] D'oh! Ooh! Ow! Etc....Yeah!

They land on some ice...which immediately breaks off
and begins to sink.MUNCHYou know, it's always something.WINDYeeeeeeeeeehaw!JUNIORLook!WIND[blowing noises]ALLYeah! Woohoo! Etc.JUNIORBye! And thanks!WINDAnytime. Look me up next time you blow through town!

The gang begins to trudge up towards the frozen
palace, sneaking past some dumbass penguin guards.
Inside, Munch slips on some ice, narrowly escaping
death once again.MUNCHAAAhhhhhh!FLUTTERGrab my wing!

Inside the throne room, Jackie is fitting Irontail for
a royal robe.IRONTAIL[sinister chuckle] by morning April Valley will be
frozen solid, and never again will I have to endure
   the springing of Spring, the rising of sun, or
             the...bringing of bonnets.JACKIEHold still, I say!

Junior, Flutter, and Munch sneak in silently, and
notice the trinkets frozen in a huge block of ice.JACKIEThat about does it. How's it feeling in the arms?IRONTAILRoomy. A perfect fit.JACKIEThis will keep you warm in the winter wasteland, now
               known as everywhere!JUNIORMunch, do you like eating ice cream?MUNCHI love ice cream!JUNIORWell you're in luck.IRONTAILSpeaking of perfect fits...JACKIE...What? Why are you looking at me like that?MUNCHI see the ice but when do I get the cream?JUNIORJust a little bit longer!IRONTAILWe make a charming couple, you and I. the whole
            world is our frozen oysterJACKIEAnd finally I get to rule it all!IRONTAILYou?JACKIEWell you didn't think you'd rule it?IRONTAILOh I think you're forgetting whose idea this whole
                    scheme was.JACKIEYes, but we took my car!IRONTAILGood point, got me there. How about a power-sharing
                   arrangement?

The two shake hands. Meanwhile in the corner of the
room, Munch has licked the leaf of Fall free from the
 ice. Suddenly, they're spotted by Montresor the bat,
who tugs on Irontail's sleeve.IRONTAILCottontail!

In this short amount of time, Munch has miraculously
licked all the way to the center of the ice block,
freeing the spring and the other thingies. Epic
penguin battle ensues.JACKIEGet them!JUNIORGo wide! Flutter, over here!

Flutter does a sick hockey puck boomerang move with
the sun of Summer, knocking down the ice chandelier
on top of the villains. Then Irontail lifts the
chandelier off them with Edward Cullen-like
strength.JUNIORQuick, Come on! Let's go!

There is a chase scene through the ice tunnels.
JUNIOR, MUNCH, and FLUTTER emerge from the tunnel
and begin walking through a blizzard. Then IRONTAIL
and JACKIE emerge.JUNIORWe gotta find our way out of here!FLUTTERWe gotta hide!MUNCHOr at least find a place to stash these things!FLUTTERI can't see!MUNCHMe neither!JUNIORThere!

They come upon a foreboding clock tower made of
ice.MUNCHWhat is this place?JUNIORThis must be the clock of Winter!

Suddenly, there is a voice from behind.IRONTAILWhat, no catapults?

Munch throws a tiny mouse-sized snowball at Jackie.JACKIEOh! How'd you guess, my favorite game!

Jackie traps them in a giant snowball with her epic
sexy snow powers.IRONTAILIrontail and Frost do it again!JACKIEI think you mean Frost and IrontailJUNIORI've got an idea! stay here!MUNCHDuh.

Conveniently, they are still right in front of the
entrance to the clock tower. Junior effortlessly digs
through the giant snowball and finds himself inside
the clock of Winter. He spots the shiny thingy that
probably controls the seasons. Outside, things aren't
looking good for Flutter and Munch.IRONTAILI think it wise we disposed of these forever.JACKIE[evilly] My pleasure...

Jackie is ready to straight up murder these animal
children.IRONTAILI meant these, not those.

Having been discouraged from committing infanticide,
Jackie contemplates the weather-controlling clock
thingies.JACKIEI know a place for these where they'll never be seen
   again. And lucky for us, it's right over here!

She means this giant convenient cliff-slash-abyss
they're standing next to. Back inside the clock,
Junior is being a genius.JUNIORThe timing mechanism must be driven by the master
   governor in the upper pivot rod! Okay. Today,
          tomorrow, today, tomorrow, now!

He successfully grabs the crystal and exits the clock
tower.JACKIEWhat is with this rabbit?IRONTAILMust be genetic.

Now that junior has removed the last clock piece,
there are no more seasons at all. The ground begins to
shake.JUNIORUh oh.

Suddenly, the clock tower is surrounded in a
terrifying green vortex, which extends up into the sky
and spreads throughout the land. Cut to April Valley.PETERHuh??ELROYOh my.

The same apocalyptic green sky and lightning storm is
happening in Summer Hill, and Fall Falls. Back at the
clock of Winter, Junior has a determined look on his
little bunny face.JUNIORGive us back those and I'll give you back this!IRONTAILNevah!

Just then, his tail gets struck by a bolt of
apocalypse lightning.IRONTAILHeruuugherughuuuaahghh!...I guess we're open to
                   negotiation.JACKIEHere's the deal, you give us back winter, we'll give
  you Fall. I don't mind watching things shrivel.JUNIORNot a chance! It's all or nothin, freeze dry! I'm
                   not kidding!

Junior dangles the crystal over the cliff's edge.IRONTAILThink you're pretty cute, eh, little tiny bunny? You
             drop yours, we drop ours.FLUTTERWhere you goin?MUNCHGoin' to get my munch on! Nom nom nom nom nomIRONTAILOw! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! (his tail makes noise)JACKIEStop that tail ringing!IRONTAILI can't! Ow! Ow ow!JACKIEI said cut it out, Fluffy!IRONTAILAnything you want, my dear!JACKIEDon't call me that!

Jackie attacks Irontail, and in the struggle, the
leaf and sun fall off the cliff!IRONTAILThis is all your fault, my dear!JACKIEOh, Fluffy! Don't turn on me now, Fluffy!
 The two fight over the spring.IRONTAILI got it! I got it! I got it!

Jackie pounces again and they both fall off the cliff,
but all the important clock parts fall with them.FLUTTERI can't believe I'm about to do this!MUNCHFlutter!

Flutter dives down into the abyss, and for a moment
disappears into the darkness.JUNIOROh, Flutter...

Is he dead? No, this is a children's movie. Flutter
appears behind them, heroically holding all the clock
pieces.JUNIORYeah!MUNCHWoohoo!

Junior restores the crystal to the clock of Winter.ALLWoohoo! Yeah! Etc.MUNCHThat was awesome! We should do this more often.FLUTTERDon't EVEN joke about that.JUNIORBut how are we gonna get back home?MUNCHI am NOT getting back in that bubble.WINDYeeeeeeehaww!ANTOINEDid somebody call a taxicab?

The gang climbs on top of mister Wind, and they set
off towards Fall Falls to start making things
right.WINDEverybody comfortable?ALLYeah! Woohoo! Etc.WINDLet's blow!

Munch returns to Fall Falls, restores the clock, says
goodbye to her new friends, and reunites with her
loving parents.MUNCHSee you guys!JUNIORSee ya, Munch!FLUTTERSee ya!MAMA MOUSEOh, we were so worried about you!PAPA MOUSEWelcome home, honey.

Next stop is Summer Hill, where Flutter restores
Summer.CHIPMUNKThanks, Flutter!JUNIORBye Flutter!FLUTTERThanks, I had fun! Bye y'all!MAMA ROBINWelcome home baby! Ooh, your mama missed you!

Suddenly, a crack in the egg. Then a chirp!FLUTTERLittle brother!

Finally, Junior returns home to April Valley.JUNIORThanks for everything, wind. Catch you later!WINDBye!

He restores the spring of Spring and the clock begins
working again. In the town center, all are gathered.ANTOINELet me through, let me through! Peter, to you I have
  made a promise. And today I have kept that promise!
               I give to you, your son!JUNIORMom! Dad!PETERJunior!MRS. COTTONTAILWe were so worried about you.ANTOINE(sniffs) Sadly, Antoine has... no one to hug!

 Junior and his mom hug Antoine the hero. Suddenly,
 there comes a deep voice from the crowd.IRONTAILwhat a tender scene!JACKIEI'd like to freeze it forever!PETERIrontail...! Stay here. Let me take care of this.

 Peter advances towards Jackie's onslaught of ice
 rays, using the calendar as a shield. One of the
 pages rips off.PETERHey, look everyone! April's here!JACKIE(shooting magic ice rays)PETER[grunting in reaction]IRONTAILIce him, Jackie!JUNIORHold on Dad, I'm coming!ANTOINEJunior!

Junior heroically jumps in front of his father,
deflecting Jackie's ice ray with the shiny key. The
ice magic ricochets and freezes Jackie instead!IRONTAILLooks like you won another one, Cottontail. I don't
 mean to turn tail and run, but it's time to put this
                    battle on ice.JACKIEExcuse me! Aren't you forgetting something?IRONTAILSo sorry, my dear.JACKIEI'm sorry too, Fluffy!

Jackie shoots a freeze ray at Irontail, who becomes
a big ice cube and comically falls into the pink
lemonade river. The crowd cheers!MRS. COTTONTAILOh Junior, you're just like your father. Isn't he,
                       Peter?PETERI think he's his own man now. Aren't you, Junior? I
                   mean, Peter.JUNIORAw, Dad!PETERYou know son, I've had a little trouble with the
nougat machinery. I could really use a guy with some
           new ideas. If ya know anybody.JUNIORFirst, for temperature control purposes, I propose
adding a bank of digital thermometers to the nougat
                        vat...SSSAnd that's the story of the bee who saved arbor
 day-- I mean the bunny who saved Spring. Yes, yes!
That's a much better story. Nobody likes bees, they
  just sting people and interrupt them, but that's
        just my opinion, Seymour S. Sassafras.
