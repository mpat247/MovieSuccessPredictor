                              Eran Creevy1   INT. COACH / MOTORWAY. MORNINGA large empty coach, all dull beige seats and wood veneer,
    makes its way along a stretch of motorway.2   INT. COACH / MOTORWAY. MORNINGAt the back of the coach we see a lone passenger. His eyes
    closed, head drooped. Suddenly he raises a hand and rubs the
    bridge of his nose. It's no use, Chris, 25, can't sleep. He
    pulls up a set of head phones, puts them on, and presses play
    on his MP3.3   INT. COACH. MORNINGLong shot from the front of the coach, the driver's gruff
    face to the left, empty seats filtering away from camera,
    Chris' head peaking above a back seat. We hear the music
    from his MP3 begin to play. It's Noel McKoy's "Brighter Day",
    a northern soul track that's reminiscent of Motown and
    comparable to the vocal sound of Marvin Gaye.

    The track will play over the following opening scenes, the
    credits fading subtly in and out in white text.4   EXT. STREET. MORNINGWe follow from behind as a hooded character walks with intent
    through Dudlowe: a sprawling new town built in the fifties to
    house the east end after the Second World War.CUT TO:We reveal Shifty, 25, Pakistani, as he makes his way through
    those morning streets. He blows on his hands to warm them up.SHIFTYSuddenly he ducks down and nips through an opening in a
    fence, making a short cut.5   INT. TREVOR HOUSE / BATHROOM. MORNINGBird's eye view on Trevor Perry, average looking, thickset,
    pallid skin, lying beneath the surface of the bath water,
    holding his nose.SIDE ANGLE ON BATH: TREVOR RISES, NOT GASPING FOR AIR, JUSTCALM, UNNATURAL ALMOST. SNOT RUNS FROM HIS NOSTRILS.2.6    INT. COACH. MORNING.Chris stares out of the window. The music still playing on
     his MP3. The coach makes a sharp left turn, the camera just
     catching a glimpse of the sign: DUDLOWE NEW TOWN.7    INT. GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNINGGlen, a severe almost cruel face, empty's about a kilo of
     cocaine onto a clean glass table.8    INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNINGJasmine, 25, pretty with out make up, dressed in a white

     strip of waste land Shifty just walked across.13   GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNINGGlen splits the cocaine into two piles.14   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / BEDROOM. MORNINGTrevor sits on the edge of the bed, staring at the floor. His

     face, he seems a little more with it.18   INT. GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNINGGlen opens a tub of Glucose and empties a measure into one
     half of the cocaine. He mixes it carefully.19   EXT. REZ'S HOUSE / BACK GARDEN. MORNINGShifty opens a back gate and walks towards a house.20   EXT. DUDLOWE STREET. DAYChris makes his way through the streets, bag slung over his
     shoulder. He looks around at the old place. Soaking it in.21   INT. GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNINGGlen takes a spoon of cocaine from the unmixed half and mixes
     it with citric acid. He sucks it up into a syringe.22   EXT. REZ'S HOUSE . MORNINGShifty quietly opens the back door to the house.23   INT. GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT / BEDROOM. MORNINGGlen carries the syringe to Loretta, pretty , but with bad
     facial burns on the side of her face. He injects the cocaine
     mix into her arm. She lays back on the bed, taking on the
     rush.4.24   EXT. DUDLOWE STREET. MORNINGChris walks along a residential road, in his hand a piece of
     paper with a scribbled address. He finds the right house. He
     stands there for a moment then hits stop on his MP3. Our
     soulful soundtrack comes to an end. He pulls down his head
     phones, walks to the door and knocks gently.25   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNINGShifty stands at the table sorting through letters. He hears
     the knock and walks to open it. He takes off his jacket, puts
     it on a hanger and opens the front door to reveal Chris.SHIFTYFucking hell, man...

     Shifty can't help but smile.SHIFTY (CONT'D)You're early!CHRISShifty.

     A smile creeps across Chris' face.SHIFTYYes, rude boy.CHRISYou alright geezer.SHIFTYI'm sweet... come in, man, come in.

     perched on the cistern. He looks at himself in the mirror.5.27   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / SHIFTY'S BEDROOM. EARLY MORNINGChris walks into Shifty's bedroom. He puts down his bag and
     pulls on a fresh tee shirt. He looks around at the room. New
     DVD player, LCD on the wall, a new game console, DVD's, CD's,
     lots of pristine trainers placed perfectly side by side,
     books about business, books about film, a perfectly stacked
     pile of mobile phone bills with the word "PAID" scribed
     across them. A picture of Mohammed Ali next to a picture of
     Allah. He approaches the window and looks out at the morning
     sun resting over a dull, featureless Dudlowe New-Town. He
     stands, staring.28   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNINGChris walks into the kitchen to see Shifty getting breakfast
     ready. Shifty turns to face him.SHIFTYYou alright son?CHRISYeah I just needed to splash my
               face, freshen up a bit.SHIFTYHave you slept?CHRISDid I fuck.SHIFTYMate, neither have I... I just got

          She's got fucking massive Gary's.

Chris laughs.CHRISYou always loved your titties,

Shifty lays sausages into a sizzling pan.SHIFTY (CONT'D)Mate, do you mind halal?CHRISNo, no, that's sweet mate,
          whatever.A BEAT.SHIFTYWere you on just one bus?CHRISYeah... no sorry, two. I had to
          change at Luton.SHIFTYLUTON!CHRISYeah, man.SHIFTYFucking random.

Shifty covers the sausages with a lid. We hear someone moving
about upstairs. Shifty quickly walks over to the freezer,
opens the door, reaches into the back and pulls out a large
bag of sweet corn.SHIFTY (CONT'D)I've got a few things to do today
          geezer, you can stay here if you
          want, just chill out.

He rummages about, and gradually, one by one, pulls out
tightly, cellophane-wrapped bags of coke and crack. He places
them in the pockets of his hooded top. Chris watches Shifty
closely, but doesn't say anything.7.SHIFTY (CONT'D)Or you can come with me?CHRISWhatever.A BEAT.CHRIS (CONT'D)(whispers)
               Does your brother know you keep
               those there?

     Shifty shakes his head.CHRIS (CONT'D)(Whispering)
               You not worried?SHIFTYMate, he doesn't eat vegetables.

     Shifty walks past Chris and taps reassuringly him on the arm.WE STAY ON CHRIS' FACE, AS HE TAKES IT IN.SHIFTY (O.S.) (CONT'D)Apart from in a pot noodle.29   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / STAIRWELL / KITCHEN. MORNINGWe follow Trevor from behind as he descends the stairs and
     walks into a large, smartly decked kitchen, an eight-year-old
     boy, Freddie, circles the kitchen-table smashing a Darth
     Vader into passing stools. Katie a three year old baby girl
     eats breakfast and Jasmine beats eggs in a bowl whilst
     talking on the phone.JASMINE(on phone)
               ... she's living like a drifter babe,
               I'm telling you, she's split... sort
               of... with Stefan... I know she did...
               but she stays at Mike's in the
               week, and then she's back at

               kids (to baby) Katie, darling, stop
               banging your bowl...

     Trevor considers the bowl of cereal and fruit juice laid out
     for him. His stomach churns. Cold sweat smothers his brow.8.JASMINE (CONT'D)(on phone)
               ...Neither knows about the other, and
               then she expects me (she drops to a
               whisper) to fucking cover for her
               (normal volume) Stefan's my mate
               for Christ's sake, I'm not getting

     This is too much for Trevor. He turns and walks away from the
     table.JASMINE (CONT'D)(on phone)
               ... and she has a go at me for taking
               on too much

                      looking up)

     breakfast untouched.JASMINE (CONT'D)Oh... what... nothing, Trevor's just
               walked out without touching his
               breakfast... I don't know, I thought
               so anyway...30   EXT. DRIVEWAY. MORNINGSilence. Trevor soaks it in - deep breaths - panic subsiding.
     He approaches his work van. "T. PALMER - BUILDER'S MERCHANT"
     inscribed on the side. He gets in - suddenly his mobile rings
     - he answers.JASMINEWhat's the matter?

     Off screen Katie continues to bash her bowl on the tray.TREVORNothing, I'm fine.JASMINEWhy didn't you say good-bye?TREVORYou were gassing away to Nicola...JASMINEAnd why didn't you touch your
               breakfast?9.TREVORI'm not hungry.

     starts the engine.31   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / FRONT ROOM. MORNINGJasmine drops the phone by her side, shocked at Trevor's
     temperament, and watches through the front room window as he
     drives away.10.32   INT. SHIFTY'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNINGShifty's laying out the breakfast. At that moment, Rez,
     Shifty's brother, walks in. Mid 30's, portly. He sees Chris.REZ(PAKISTANI - SUBTITLED)Motherfucker, the return of the
               white man.

     Chris stands and goes to embrace Rez, but Rez walks past and
     grabs a glass of orange juice from the side.CHRISHow you doing Rez, good to see you,
               man?REZI wondered why I could hear voices.
               I thought he'd brought home a rent

     dials a number on his mobile but gets the following message(V.O.)This number is currently

     He puts down the phone, and sits there, waiting, agitated.34   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / KITCHEN.   MORNING.All three of them eat in silence. Chris' eyes dart
     occasionally to Rez who pays no attention to anything but the
     food. There is an uncomfortable air in the room.35   INT. TREVORS'S VAN. MORNINGTrevor does a line of cocaine of the tip of his car key. We
     see that he doesn't have a huge amount left in his wrap.36   INT. REZ'S HOUSE/KITCHEN. MORNINGShifty's putting away breakfast, Chris and Rez sit at the

Rez pauses, thinking. Chris clocks him with an almost icy
stare.REZOh right.

Chris looks back down at his magazine. Rez knows he hit a raw
nerve. An uncomfortable silence. Shifty tries to break the
ice by talking about a more trivial topic.SHIFTY(to Rez)
          You remember Rachel, you fucking
          lunged her at Jazzbo Browns?15.REZWHAT... that's BULLSHIT.CHRISYeah, yeah, you went in for the
               kill and she lent away like she was

               I wouldn't mind if he did it
               discreetly, but he lunged her from
               about three feet.

     Shifty mimics Rez's historic lunge, Rez starts to laugh at
     the memory of it, covering his face with his hands.37   INT. TREVOR'S VAN. MORNINGTrevor tries the mobile again but gets the same message. He

Shifty watches Glen.SHIFTYWhere's the gear?GLENLenny's got it.*As Shifty walks to the car he discreetly backhands a roll of*money to Glen. Seated in the driver's seat sits Lenny, a
frail man, eyes sunken, hair thinning. His denim jacket
giving him the only dignity from looking like a walking
corpse. Seated next to him is Loretta. She's pulling out a
crack pipe itching to take a hit. Shifty leans through the
window and in one swift move takes a package from Lenny,
slipping it into his jacket, and drops a pile of cash into
his lap.SHIFTYAlright Lenny?LENNYAlright mate.SHIFTYYou alright Loretta.LORETTAAlright Shifty.25.56   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / FRONT ROOM. DAYRez lays down a prayer mat. He kneels down and begins to

               out.

     Lenny, having found the keys, starts the car simultaneously
     tooting the horn and igniting the window wipers. They drive
     off, frog-hopping the VW down the road.GLENYeah, it's a good job we're not
               making a fucking scene.59   EXT. ROW OF GARAGES. DAYChris and Shifty turn a corner into a row of garages. Chris

     Bob turns and walks out the porta-cabin. Trevor follows.TREVORBob.

     Bob ignores him.TREVOR (CONT'D)Bob I need this money.

     Bob stays quiet, approaches a workman and starts talking to
     him. Trevor stands behind them.TREVOR (CONT'D)Bob!

     Bob turns to him, and puts out his hand.BOBThank's for coming today Trevor,
               we'll definitely be in touch.

     Bob's hand hangs there. Trevor looks at him, to the hand. Bob
     turns away and carries on talking. Trevor stands for a moment
     then turns and walks away. Trevor's face is awash with
     emotion, it looks like he wants to cry but he holds it
     together.61   EXT. HILL TOP. DAYShifty and Chris sit atop of a hill looking out across a
     skate park - The camera observing them from behind. Shifty
     hands Chris a rolled spliff. Shifty doesn't say anything,

     Chris looks back out over the estate. Shifty's phone starts
     ringing. He looks at the screen it reads Trevor P MOB. He
     hits reject.62   INT. TREVOR'S VAN. DAYTrevor gets the answering machine. He smashes out at his
     dashboard.63   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. DAYRez carries a bundle of dirty clothes to the washing machine
     and clumsily throws them in. He pulls out the powder tray but
     it comes out completely from the machine.REZFUCK!He tries to wedge it back in but it doesn't want to go. Rez
     gets down on his knees and tries again, to no avail. He looks
     in the gap, and sees something.30.He sticks his fingers in and starts rooting around. He has
     something; slowly Rez pulls out a large, see-through,
     watertight bag brimming with wraps of cocaine and crack. Rez
     sits back against the machine just staring at it.64   EXT. HILL TOP. DAYShifty and Chris just sit. Suddenly Chris notices something.CHRISWhat's that?SHIFTYWhat?

     Chris points.CHRISThat fucking thing.65   EXT. PARK. DAYShifty and Chris approach an extreme sports park ride that
     helps build upper strength. At either end of a raised beam
     are two handles.CHRISWhat does it fucking do?

     Chris grabs the handles and starts moving with it.CHRIS (CONT'D)Mate, grab the other end.

     Shifty grabs the handles and starts running parallel to
     Chris, suddenly they both lift off the ground.CHRIS (CONT'D)FUCKING HELL!SHIFTYSHIIIIIIIIT!They're both cracking up laughing, loving it.66   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / KITCHEN / BATHROOM. DAYOn Jasmine's kitchen floor, just outside the connecting
     bathroom, are stacked a variety of toiletry goods. The sounds
     of scrubbing and movement echo out. Jasmine, her dressing
     gown grubby and soaked, cleanses, scrubs, and cleans the
     emptied bathroom like a woman possessed. She's purging her
     haven, washing away the sin that has tainted her sanctum.31.WE CUT TO A LONG SHOT, OVER FREDDIE'S SHOULDER TO SEE HIMWATCHING HER.67   EXT. VALERIE'S BLOCK COUNCIL FLATS. DAY.A fairly respectable but featureless tenement block looms.68   INT. VALERIE'S BLOCK COUNCIL FLATS/CORRIDOR. DAYShifty and Chris stand before a racing green door upon which
     a small ceramic emblem of a cat nestles under the number
     eight. Shifty knocks on the door. Silence. He stares at the
     emblem of the cat.SHIFTYFucking cat lovers.A BEAT.CHRISI can't stand people who feed their
               cat's... fucking red snapper... or

               day.32.A BEAT.Shifty bends down and looks through the letterbox. He sees a
     shadow approaching. He stands back up. The latch snaps,
     echoing down the clinical looking hallway.69                                                                  *INT. VALERIE'S FLAT / HALLWAY. DAYWe follow Shifty through a corridor deprived of light and
     colour. Valerie, who leads the way, is considerably smaller.
     We open into the front room and Valerie's revealed for the
     first time. At 5'5" with long arms book-ended by bony hands
     and a sculptured face, she smacks of an ageing Goth and is
     clearly an old hippie, her brain starched by LSD. Sleeping
     cats inhabit the surroundings like stationed guards.A BEAT.Valerie looks towards Chris.SHIFTYValerie, this is Chris, he's erm,
               he's an old friend of mine, we grew
               up together. He's cool. We go way

     He offers a hand that she takes politely.VALERIEYeah. Hi.

     A moment of uncomfortable silence.SHIFTYI called yesterday but you were

VALERIE'S FRONT ROOM. DAYChris looks about at the bits and bobs that litter her front
     room. Sleeping felines. Chintzy ornaments of cats. He picks
     up a framed photo of her daughter, Loretta, in better days,
     fresh faced, before the scars, ready to take on the world. He
     looks slightly shocked to see this.CUT TO:Chris sits in a sunken armchair, and looks around the room.
     He looks closely at a sleeping cat near his chair. He moves
     his foot and touches it but it slides along the floor, not
     moving just solid, as if frozen. It dawns on Chris that all
     the cats in the room are stuffed.34.Chris sits back in the chair, suddenly from next door, the
     deep hum of a drum and bass track starts thumping through the
     wall. It's so heavy it makes the shelves of chintzy cat
     ornaments rattle.71                                                                   *INT. VALERIE'S KITCHEN. DAYValerie prepares the tea whilst Shifty leans against the
     counter top.SHIFTYHow you been, alright.VALERIEYeah, I'm alright babe, you
               alright?SHIFTYYeah, I'm alright.VALERIEGood, good.

     Silence as Valerie prepares the tea.SHIFTYShe visited you yet?VALERIENo... not for a long time,
               Shifty... not seen her for a long
               time really, darling.

     Shifty walks over to Valerie and starts helping her make the
     tea. He seems to know where stuff is in this kitchen. He
     places a hand on her arm.SHIFTYShe'll come back one day.

     They carry on making the tea.72                                                                   *INT. VALERIE'S FRONT ROOM. DAYThe drum and bass track continues to thud through the wall. A
     fresh pot of tea stands next to an empty can of soft drink.
     Shifty pulls out two rocks of crack and places them before
     Val. Chris watches with intent. He almost can't believe what
     he's seeing. She opens the cellophane and places down a small
     yellowy lump. Then carefully she fashions the can into a
     smoking utensil. At that moment, one of her cat ornaments
     falls from the shelf because of the vibrating bass. Valerie
     walks over, picks up the china tabby, and places it carefully
     back on the side. She sits back down, clearly distressed by
     the music.35.We're tight on the can as Valerie lifts the paraphernalia to
      her mouth and takes a hit, a small grimace etched across her
      lips. She gestures with her hand offering Chris some.CHRISNo, no, I'm fine......thanks
                though.CLOSE ON SHIFTY.SHIFTYLook Val we're gonna have to do
                one...THE CAMERA PANS TO VAL- SHE LOOKS ANAESTHETIZED - BACK TOSHIFTY...Shifty nods at Chris for them both to leave. The thudding
      bass echoes out as they exit the flat. Chris looks slightly
      unsettled by what he's seen.73                                                                    *EXT. OUTSIDE VALERIE'S FLAT. DAYShifty shuts the door to Valerie's behind him. They go to
      walk off when suddenly Shifty stops dead in his tracks. He
      pauses for a while, and then shouts to Chris who has carried
      on walking.SHIFTYGeezer, give me a minute.

      Chris turns to see Shifty pulling up the sleeve on his
      jacket. Shifty reaches through the letterbox and manages to
      unhook the latch. The door swings slowly open, the drum 'n'
      bass booming out.73A                                                                   *INT. OTIS' FLAT / FRONTROOM. DAYShifty enters. The CAMERA follows. We're introduced to a dark
      hallway, clothes, magazines and CD's litter the floor. Shifty
      peers into one of the bedrooms leading off from the hallway -
      a mattress with no sheets. Shifty carries on down the
      hallway. Reaching a door, he slowly pushes it open, to reveal
      a grotty front room. On the TV a violent movie scene plays
      out, the sound turned down. A wiry looking 18 year old,
      Otis, sits on the sofa rolling a spliff, absorbed by the
      films images. A chavvy-looking bird sits to his left. Shifty,
      cool as a cucumber, rolls into the front room, straight up to
      the stereo, and turns it off. The young kid sits there, just
      staring, a spliff held in his two hands, totally flummoxed.
      Shifty stares him out.36.*SHIFTYAlright mate?OTISAlright.

     Shifty looks about at the room.SHIFTYWhat's your name?OTISOtis.A BEAT.SHIFTYWhere do you get your weed from?OTISIt aint... it aint mine, my erm, my
               mate left it, he left it here... I

               me...A BEAT.SHIFTY (CONT'D)At half the price.

     Otis looks at his girlfriend, and back to Shifty, utterly
     confused.76   EXT. VALERIE'S BLOCK COUNCIL FLATS. DAYChris watches a young mum below, she can't be more than 16,
     pregnant, and with another baby in a pram. He looks saddened
     by the girl. He turns and walks into the flat.77   INT. OTIS' FLAT / FRONTROOM. DAYSHIFTYI'm gonna sell you your weed half
               price, and your gonna keep this
               noise down.A BEAT.SHIFTY (CONT'D)Yeah?A BEAT.SHIFTY (CONT'D)(with threat)YEAH?At that moment Otis and his girlfriend look up to see Chris
     standing in the doorway. His presence adds menace to the
     situation.OTISYeah, alright, yeah.SHIFTYBecause if I hear one word of
               complaint from next door, just one
               single complaint, I'll come back
               here and I'll take your TV, I'll
               take your stereo, and I'll shove em
               up your birds arse.

     He lets the words sink in. The girl looks a little shocked.SHIFTY (CONT'D)Do you understand me?38.Otis nods.SHIFTY (CONT'D)DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?OTISYeah, yeah, it's cool, I'm sorry,
                  man, I didn't know I had it on
                  loud, I would have turned it down,
                  I'm sorry.

     Silence. Shifty stares Otis out. Otis looks away. Shifty
     picks up a biro from the floor and writes a number on Otis'
     wall.SHIFTYCall me if you need any more weed.

     He walks into the hallway, past Chris.CHRIS(almost disdain)
                  You don't miss a fucking trick.SHIFTYYou know it.78   INT. VALERIE'S BLOCK COUNCIL FLATS / STAIRWELL. DAYShifty and Chris make their way down the winding stairs of
