CHAPTER 19: A Different Future------------------------------EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-DAYWill and Smith are walking down a forest path. The boy has a radiation
tracker in his hand.WILLI've got a fix on Dad's suit beacon.

Dead ahead is a field of beautiful, alien flowers, their purple leaves
moving in the wind like an azure sea.WILLWow, that's Mom's favorite color.SMITHHow droll.

distance begins to twist, a rushing distortion sweeping towards them,
flowers growing, landscape aging rapidly within.SMITHRun, child, run.

Smith turns, begins to flee, pulling Will with him, away from the
rushing warp. Smith trips, falls, closes his eyes, waiting for the
distortion to overtake him. A beat. He opens his eyes.

SMITH-POV. A glowing, stationary portal shimmers behind him, revealing
beyond a forest ever older, darker, more overgrown.SMITHWill? Will?

No sign of the boy. Then, from behind a tree, Will appears.WILLWow!

The field across the portal has is now a mass of giant plants, the
flowers a deep red. Will rushes across the rip in space.SMITHWilliam, wait!WILLSee, over here I'm in the future.

(steps back towards Smith)

          Here I'm in the past. Don't worry.
          If my theories are correct, these
          doorways should remain stable, for
          a while anyway.SMITHI can barely contain my glee. Why
          aren't you aging like the plants?WILLThat's just an effect of the portals
          forming. Once they stabilize you can
          cross from one time to another

Will takes Smith's hand, pulls him across the threshold.

SMITH-POV. Where he stands is now lush, the sky overhead a glowing
crimson. Yet behind him, the path in as it originally appeared.
Younger. The sky, bright. Will has run deeper into the brush.

Smith notices something by his feet. He clears away the brush,
revealing shapes beneath the foliage. His expression darkens.WILL (OVER)What did you find?

Will has returned.SMITHCome, come, son, no time for
          distractions. Let's move on.

Smith shoves Will on, the boy unable to see what Smith saw.

portal rushes towards them like a glittering maw, the side of the
crater aging and crumbling in it's wake.

more deserted future.JOHNThe ship's back that way. we have to

lizard monkey aloft, her face remarkably like Penny's.

Suddenly BLIP begins to SHRIEK. (OVER) RUSTLING leaves.

SHAPES are moving in the trees, the vague outline of camouflaged forms
dropping to the ground. Five figures suddenly de-camouflage. Lizard
monkeys, two large, two smaller.

Directly in front of Penny, the largest monkey de-camouflages. Fully
grown, the beast is nearly twice Penny's height. Around the creature's
wrist is something odd. An old, tattered green ribbon.

BLIP begins to SCREAM and SHRIEK.PENNYBlip, no!

Too late. Blip leaps on the giant creature, grabs the ribbon. The
beast could slap Blip away like a fly. But the creature doesn't
resist, just stares down at Blip with something akin to tenderness.

Blip looks at the ribbon in his hand. Then at the one around her
wrist. Save for their age difference., the ribbons are identical.

The giant monkey moves forward, closing on a petrified Penny, paw
reaching out, touching her face. The beast begins stroking Penny's
cheek in a familiar gesture of comfort.GIANT BLIPNice girl. Pretty girl. Nice.

Penny stares up in stunned wonder.EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-EVENING-FUTUREDon and John are crossing the brush. The terrain in growing ever more
desolate, desert like. The double suns hang on the horizon.JOHNWe should be able to see the ship.

down and lifts a small metal fragment in his hand.

towards the bridge and crows nest hanging over the bubble.

Will walks to the control console platform, the platform now beginning
to rise on the gantry, towards the bridge above.

JOHN-POV. Something hangs from below the climbing Spider Smith's back.
It's an egg pouch of the kind they saw on the probe ship log.JOHN(shouting)

          Will, it's a trick. Smith's carrying
          an egg sack. If he's willing to stay
          on this world and die, why is he
          about to spawn? He's going through
