WORKOUT AREA � SAME NIGHTESTABLISHING SHOT OF MASTER KWAN'S SCHOOL, A RAMSHACKLE BUILDING IN ABURNED OUT ROW OF STORES.His is the only one still    occupied, and it doesn't look that
permanent. In the window    is a cardboard, handwritten sign that reads
"Kwan's Shaolin Kung Fu".    What remains visible behind the poster and
the security grate is an    IMPRESSION of people moving and milling
around.INT. WORKOUT AREA � SAME NIGHTESTABLISHING SHOT OF KWAN'S SHAOLIN KUNG FU SCHOOL.The students are doing their own thing, and they are a mixture of old
and young, men and women. They are not dressed alike, as they would
be in a Karate school: they are dressed in old T-shirts and tattered
sweat pants. This is not a wealthy school, by any means, and that is
typified by the appearance of SIFU KWAN, who is walking through the
students as they train. He is wizened old man, 70 years old if he is
a day, and he is dressed in a fraying Chinese jacket, scruffy cloth
shoes and a discolored Chinese T-shirt.ANGLE ON A YOUNG ADULTStruggling through a horse stance, his face in real pain. He is
trying his best to hold the stance, but his legs are quivering. He
drops out of the stance onto his knees. Master Kwan is right beside
him.YOUNG ADULTSifu Kwan, was that long enough? It's been 10 minutes...

Sifu Kwan shakes his head and puts his hands behind his back as he
walks past the student.KWANAt Shaolin Temple, in misty Songshan mountains, We monks
           trained in iron palm until our hands bled...
                   (beat)

           ... then we trained some more.
He walks on, leaving a puzzled student behind.YOUNG ADULT(getting back into horse stance)
           I guess not...ANGLE ON KWANAs he walks around the different people training. As one woman is
moving through an intricate series of movements, he sighs and
rearranges her hands.KWANTiger grasps his tail, not hamburger!
He    moves on, studying the room with his eyes, often glancing toward
the    door, and then toward the small clock on a table near the door.
It    is late, and Kwan is obviously waiting for someone to arrive. As
he    is waiting, a young STUDENT comes up to Kwan.STUDENTMaster Kwan, when can I learn flying kicks? I see Bruce
              Lee...KWANBruce Lee actor, we fighters, warriors. A sparrow in
              flight is beautiful, but a side kick to the ribs is
              effective. Show me.

The boy shrugs    and then    starts throwing side kicks. Kwan   is half
looking at the    boy and    half looking towards the door and   the clock.
The boy throws    three or    four kicks and then stops. He is   watching
Kwan watching    the door.    Kwan sees him, and turns back to   him.KWAN (CONT'D)(shaking his head)

              A Shaolin warrior lets nothing intrude. Continue, never
              mind.

He continues to kick, and Kwan continues to look at the door.
Finally, the student stops kicking, half-heartedly bows to the
master, and then moves to the side of the workout room. Kwan doesn't
know he's gone. Kwan turns around, forgetting for a moment what he is
doing, and comes face to face with the mother of a student, MRS.
RODRIGUEZ, and she is holding a uniform of some sort. She smiles
widely at him and holds up the uniform. It is beautiful, obviously
hand made, and on the back is embroidered: "Kwan's Shaolin" and
underneath that is "Drew Carson". Kwan takes in the entire outfit,
while the rest of the class is gathering around to have a look. They
are all very impressed.KWAN (CONT'D)Never in my days at the Shaolin Temple have I seen
              uniform as beautiful as this. Thank you, Mrs. Rodriguez.
              I wish Drew were here to thank you himself. Ta ma de!
This last he says looking at the empty door.MOTHERI only hope it brings him luck in the tournament.KWANLuck is no concern, Mrs. Rodriguez. Shaolin warriors
           depend on heart and soul � that's how they saved the
           T'ang emporer.
He looks again at the door, then claps his hands together, gathering
his students around him.KWAN (CONT'D)Xie Xie, Mrs. Rodriguez.
                  (to class)
During my time training at the Shaolin Temple, the birthplace of the
martial arts, I was lucky (glance at Mrs. Rodriguez)... er...
fortunate to have the best instructors in the world train me. But,
there was also time for individual training � where skills were honed
like the blade of a sword. Now, it is that time for you.

He turns to go.

One of the students, before he can leave, clears his throat.STUDENT 2What do you want us to do?KWANWhen the blind follow the blind, they both fall over the
           cliff. Understand?STUDENT 2No.

The others mutter "No" and shake their heads, confused.KWANNo matter.
He exits, leaving his students staring vacantly after him.

They look at each other, honestly not knowing what to do.EXT. DREW GARAGE � SAME NIGHTESTABLISHING SHOT OF OLD GARAGE.It is kind of spooky, and there are no lights on outside. There is
candlelight inside, and it is moving around � an effect not unlike a
ghost carrying a candelabra.INT. DREW GARAGE � SAME NIGHTESTABLISHING SHOT OF INTERIOR.The area is dilapidated, but very clean, with all kinds of kung fu
and Chinese paraphenalia lying around. Around the corner comes the
spooky light, and (with music building to a crescendo), we see DREWCARSON, a    muscular 16/17 year old, bowls of flaming wax on his bare
shoulders,    moving through the garage, practicing his kung fu
maneuvers.    He is kicking, punching, etc., occasionally spilling hot
wax on his    skin (INSERT).

Drew.ANGLE ON DREWAs he continues to move around the workout area, his arms and body
moving as he tries to match the movements on the TV.
Suddenly, Kwan jumps out of the shadows, attacking. Drew reacts
instantly, evading the attack, the wax sloshing around in the bowls
but not spilling (INSERT SHOT HERE). Kwan continues the attack, and
Drew evades, their movements matching the movements on the TV almost
move for move. It is a beautiful ballet, and Drew ends it by sweeping
Kwan down to the ground. When Kwan hits the ground, hard, his face is
lit by the TV screen.ANGLE ON DREWWho, for the first time, sees that it is Kwan.DREWMASTER KWAN!He hurries over to his master, a concerned look on his face.

He leans down to help Kwan up, forgetting about the bowls of hot wax.
It pours down on Kwan, scalding him, as well as running down Drew's
chest. Kwan struggles to get up, while at the same time trying to
wipe the hot wax off.DREW (CONT'D)Master Kwan! I'm sorry, very sorry!KWAN(blustering)

              I'm OK, never mind! What are you doing anyway?DREWIs taking the glued-on cups of wax off his shoulders, while peeling
the already hard wax off his chest.DREWPracticing. I saw it in this movie...
Kwan shakes his head and walks over to Drew, standing in front of
him.KWANWhy didn't you come to class? Why waste time with this...
           Should study tapes of opponent.DREWI'll still win. Besides, the Shaolin monks never had
           tapes to study... they did it this way... right?KWANNot quite � our drills at the temple had meaning. If we
           had tapes, we would have watched them.
Drew starts to protest, but Kwan doesn't even let him start.KWAN (CONT'D)"The    warrior who knows himself and his opponent will win
           100    times in 100 battles." Study the tapes I gave you.
           All    these years of one on one training � you're the best
           I've    ever taught.DREWThe best?KWANBest white boy, maybe. Just fight like a Shaolin warrior

                   (picks up tape)

           Face reality, before it breaks your jaw!

Drew holds out his hand for the tape, and Kwan slaps it into his
hand. Drew smiles a defeated smile and turns toward the VCR, when
Drew's stepfather, BOB, walks in. He is a big, overweight man, and he
is very angry.BOB(shouting)
           Are you screwing around with this stuff again?DREWLook, Bob, I'm not bothering you, am I?BOBIt's your attitude that bothers me, son.DREWI'm not your son, Bob. Lay off.
It is a threat, one that Bob almost takes up. Kwan feels the tension
in the room, and starts to say something.BOB(cutting him off)

           to let you be part of my entourage...BOBYou mean when you're in jail...DREWJust leave me alone, Bob, OK? I NEVER asked for anything
           from you.

He spins and kicks one of the hanging bags, then walks out of the
workout room, leaving Bob and Kwan standing alone.

Kwan looks at Bob, who towers over him, and smiles sheepishly.KWANPressure. Big tournament this weekend.

He starts to walk out, but Bob follows him.BOBHow would you have liked having to take care of a kid you
           never really wanted... ?KWANI wish I had the chance...

The next guy comes up, but before they can start, the psychologist,
DR. PFEELGUT, calls for "Time" and motions Trevor over.PFEELGUTIt's    not enough just to win, Trevor. You have to destroy
              your    opponent completely, mentally and physically. Beat
              him    once, he's a threat. Humiliate him, and he'll fear
              you    forever.

Trevor listens to this, nods his head once, and when Pfeelgut goes to
leave, Trevor pushes him into the pool.
Pfeelgut comes to the surface, smiling.PFEELGUT (CONT'D)Exactly!
Trevor goes back to the ring. He really takes it      to this guy,
alternately playing with him and hurting him. As      the guy tries to
hold his own, the string to his pants comes loose      and they start to
fall down. He grabs for them with both hands, and      Trevor starts to
back up, laughing with the rest of the group.ANGLE ON PFEELGUTToweling off, who is yelling to Trevor.PFEELGUT (CONT'D)GET HIM! NOW!!Trevor looks at him for a moment, not really understanding, then sees

He pauses, and decides not to tell another Shaolin Temple story. Drew
looks at him funny � this is very against his character.KWAN (CONT'D)I saw a Shaolin monk once. I was only 5 years old at the
           time, but I remember it like it was yesterday. I was
           coming back from the market with my father. Soldiers
           stopped us and were taking the food we had just bought.
           It was all we had left to eat � no more money. These were
           hard times in China, people were selling their children
           for food, and the soldiers had no right. Who can stop
           soldiers with guns, though? Yes?

He pauses, and takes a sip of tea, checking the needle, adjusting it
and turning it slightly this way and that.KWAN (CONT'D)Just as the soldiers were leaving, a monk stepped out of
           the crowd and told them very calmly to put the food back.
           Well, naturally, they didn't. They pushed the monk, and
           the next thing I knew the soldiers were in the street,
           and the food was back in my father's arms. 5 soldiers,
           and they were in a heap on the ground, their blood mixing
           with the dust of the street.

Kwan smiles with the memory � it is a sweet and heroic one.KWAN (CONT'D)The crowd whispered "Shaolin", and he bowed to us,
           touched my cheek and smiled, then just walked on. I
           watched him until he disappeared in the distance. He was
           larger than life, a hero to a little boy of 5. I vowed
           then and there to become like him, fight for right like
           the Shaolin.
He pauses again, looking at Drew. Drew meets his gaze, wondering why
he is telling him this story.KWAN (CONT'D)I never did, though. My family left China and ended up
           here in New York, a young boy's dream left behind inChina.DREWYou mean... all the stories...?KWAN(nodding)
           Made up. I never trained at the Shaolin Temple. When I
           realized my dream couldn't come true, I convinced myself
           that it had anyway. It was a small step to convince other
           people.DREWWhy are you telling me this?KWANI've given you all I can, and it's not enough. It was
           never enough. You're like a son to me, Drew, and you have
           all the potential in the world, but I can't take you
           where you want to go.

Kwan takes the needle out of Drew's arm, and then rubs the spot where
it was with a cotton ball.KWAN (CONT'D)There, that should control the swelling.

He watches Drew, who is pondering what Kwan has said.DREWSo you're not a Shaolin?KWANNo.DREWNever were?KWANNo.
Drew nods, an idea forming in his head. A slight smile forms on his
face. Kwan was expecting him to be angry, he never expected this.KWAN (CONT'D)What?DREWIf you are not a Shaolin warrior, then I will become one.KWANWhat are you talking about?DREWI'm going to the Shaolin Temple � they can train me so I
           will never lose like that again.
Kwan feels Drew's forehead. A long beat here as Kwan studies Drew's
eyes.KWANHe hit you so hard, you're delirious. I'll get a cold
           cloth.
He starts to get up, but Drew grabs his arm and forces him back down.DREW(eyes intent)

           Don't you    see? You said    yourself I needed the right
           training �    where better    than the Shaolin Temple? What's
           holding me    here? I have    the chance to do what you
           couldn't.    I will go to    the Shaolin Temple.

Kwan looks at him, realizes he's serious. He nods his head, giving
the idea serious consideration. He smiles along with Drew.KWANI must pay for your ticket...DREWNo! I'll make it there myself.KWANI grew up on the stories of the Shaolin, and you can be
           those stories. You can live my dream for me � at least

Drew turns back to stare at the front of the temple. He is letting it
all sink in.

After a moment, he picks up his backpack and heads for the front
door. He pulls it open and disappears inside.INT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE � SAME DAYESTABLISHING SHOT OF TEMPLE INTERIOR AS DREW OPENS THE HEAVY DOOR.The muted half light inside is in direct contrast to the sunlight of
the day outside. Drew quietly closes the front door, and the half
light takes over.
He walks through the temple proper, and what follows is a MONTAGE of
temple shots, establishing the feeling of thetemple:    the famous Shaolin monk painting, the depressions in the
floor of    the training hall, the incense blackened walls of the
temple,    the temple figurines, the red lanterns hanging from the
ceiling,    a huge wooden carving of
Bodhidharma, etc.
No one is around.
Drew continues to explore, looking for someone to talk to. He wanders
into another hall, following the O.S. sounds of CHANTING.
Once inside this hall, he sees a group of monks, amid hanging incense
burners and paper lanterns, sitting down on the floor chanting in
rhythm. No one notices that Drew is standing there. The monks eyes
are open, but they don't seem to see him.
He stands there for a moment, then shrugs and walks out of that hall.
He goes into a corridor, then passes the "Wooden Man Chamber".HE STICKS HIS HEAD IN, AND SEES ALL KINDS OF WOODEN STATUES LINED UP.HE ALMOST STARTS IN, BUT IS DISTRACTED BY THE SOUNDS OF TRAININGOUTSIDE (O.S.).

A monk, the DRILL SERGEANT (hereafter D.S.), is standing in front of
a wooden post, driving his hand into the wood.

The post TREMBLES with every strike.

Drew stands next to the monk, watching him intently. Again, the monk
takes no notice of him.DREWExcuse me, Master.
No answer.DREW (CONT'D)Hello? Busy, huh?
Still no answer. The man is just slamming his hand into the post,
over and over.
Drew sighs and walks on. He goes down a path, and flowering bushes
are on either side of him. He can see the "pagoda forest" in the
distance. At the end of the path, a monk, SAN DE, is sweeping up the
path.
Drew walks up to the monk and bows.DREW (CONT'D)Master, may I ask you a question?
No answer nor response. Drew's kind of tired of this treatment.DREW (CONT'D)What's the deal here? Is everybody deaf in this temple?
           Even if you heard me, you wouldn't understand, would you?

He walks off frustrated, wondering what he has to do to get noticed.
He walks back into the chanting chamber.INT. TEMPLE � SAME DAYThe monks are still chanting. Drew stands there, listening some more,
moving with the beat, until they stop chanting.
Drew, thinking it was some kind of performance, claps his hands.DREWThat was great! Great!

and physically force him to stand up and start moving him towards the
door.DREWI just want to be a monk!

Drew is forced through the courtyard to the front door.

watches with interest as they open the door and force Drew through
it, out of the temple.

Drew gathers up the clothing and stuffs it back into his pack. He
sits there for a moment, then gets up and heads for the small shops
and stands ringing the courtyard.
He walks past a couple of the stalls, looking at the people running
them. He doesn't see Ashema. He passes a tea stall, where one old man
is sitting down sipping his tea.

Chinese, motioning towards Drew.ASHEMANot now, Bau Bau.DREWBau Bau?ASHEMAMy nickname for him. He wants to tell you a story about

Drew turns his head, and a procession of kids about his age (some
older and some younger) come walking into the courtyard.

The front door to the temple opens wide, and a column of monks, all
in their best saffron robes, are lined up waiting to receive them.

carrying some baggage. They begin to enter the temple.ASHEMAThey are disciples. This is the last class for fighting

put out by the fact that Drew is among them.

are openly hostile to him.

down, their eyes on the floor, to the figure, who is moving towards

building.D.S. (CONT'D)You will be digging today, digging our new latrines.DREWLatrines? Why?D.S.A Shaolin fighting monk-in training does not ask
           questions. He just obeys.

The D.S. leads the way to the latrine building, and the disciples
follow, each of them carrying a shovel. Drew is trudging along, not
believing what they are doing.DREW (CONT'D)I came halfway around the world to dig latrines? I could

pole on his shoulders, the muscles in his arms, shoulders and back
straining. He walks off to the side of the area to dump it.
As he dumps the dirt, a pole appears and CRACKS across his back. He
drops the buckets and falls to the ground. He gets up as quickly ashe can, but there is no one to be seen.ANGLE ON DREW AND DISCIPLESAs they are working hard on the latrines. Drew is teaching them an

Drew shakes his head and starts to eat, quickly.ANGLE ON DREWAs he loads up a two baskets of dirt onto his pole. He gets it up
onto his shoulders, in pain, and starts to walk. Immediately, the
D.S. is there in front of him.

He examines the baskets. They are not full.
He moves quickly and dumps both baskets of dirt.DREW(shocked)
           What'd you do that for?D.S.Do a job well or don't do it.ANGLE ON GAO AND THE DISCIPLESAs they are in line for water. They each drink a large glass full,
then move back to their work area. Drew is the last in line. When
Drew gets to the front, the D.S. smiles and shakes his head.D.S.Sorry, all gone. Get some more.
Drew stares at all the water spilled onto the ground, then looks up
at the D.S., then forces a smile. He takes the proferred buckets of
water (made of wood, with pointed bottoms and large handles). The
D.S. indicates that they are to be held straight out to the sides, to
work on the shoulder muscles. Drew turns and walks away, muttering to
himself.DREW (CONT'D)I'm gonna get you, man. Oh, yeah...
Gao is laughing as he watches Drew go.EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE � SAME DAYESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW FILLING THE BUCKETS IN THE STREAM.Once they are filled, he starts back for the temple. His shoulders
are straining from the weight of the buckets.

He goes over the path to the temple, having to negotiate logs over
chasms, etc. After various trials and tribulations, Drew arrives at
the temple, his arms incredibly tired. The D.S. is there waiting for
him.

Drew, determined not to show any weakness, raises the buckets a
little bit higher. He comes to the D.S., proud and defiant. The D.S.
motions for him to put the buckets down.

Without thinking, Drew, puts the buckets down, and they both fall
over, spilling their contents onto the ground. Drew tries to stop
them, but he's too late. The water has all spilled out onto the
ground.DREWDon't tell me, I know. Get more water...INT. DORM ROOM � NIGHTESTABLISHING SHOT OF DISCIPLES ALL IN BED.They are exhausted from their work. Drew is lying in bed, his eyes

Gao smiles and shakes   his head. Gao starts forward, and WHACKS Drew
in the leg with a leg   sweep. Drew tries to keep his balance, and
fights a valient, but   losing battle. He falls over the side, the dirt
in his buckets flying   everywhere. Gao wipes his hands off and
continues walking.CLOSEUP ON DREW'S BLOODY HANDA huge splinter sticking out of it. He is in real pain. The D.S.
walks over and looks at the splinter, and in one move pulls it out.D.S.(heartlessly)

He walks away.ANGLE ON DREW AND THE DISCIPLESOn a work break. They are watching the monks training in the
distance. It is all the more desirable because it is unattainable.

In the distance, a monk can be seen walking between two other monks.
They are leading him out.

The monk continues walking until he walks right in front of the
disciples. His face and body are covered with bruises and welts. The
two other monks don't say a word, their faces grim.

they are going to walk on.DREW (CONT'D)Hi, Gao. How you doing?GAO(a little worried)
           Let me pass.
He reaches down and plucks a stick out of the earth at his feet, and
then closes on Gao a little bit.DREW (CONT'D)There's something on the bottom of your basket.

Drew pokes at the basket for a moment, right over Gao's head. Then,

raised for another strike.D.S.Back to work.

towards him, ready to slam him in the shoulders.

With one beautiful move, the D.S. breaks both poles, shattering when
they hit his arms.

He runs to his backpack and pulls out a boom box with speakers, and
puts on some good old American Rock 'N' Roll.
Everyone, but Gao, is moving in time with the music. Drew is the most
accomplished dancer, but the others are pretty bad.
The entire effect of the bald-headed monks rocking out is very comic.
Drew starts showing Li and Wu a couple of dance routines (old stuff �
the swim, the twist, etc.). Everyone is having a great time.ANGLE ON GAOGlowering, as he moves toward the boom box.

He reaches for the "Stop" button.

They push and shove into the middle of the room, a couple of kicks
and punches thrown, then they face off, ready to duke it out.

The party is raging, while Gao and Drew are the only ones static, set
to do battle.

the door, including Gao. Drew, meanwhile, has the presence of mind to
jump onto the boom box, shutting it off and hiding it with his body.ANGLE ON DOORAs the D.S. opens it and sticks his head in.

It is beautiful: powerful, graceful and intimidating.

Their form done, they file out of the chamber, leaving the D.S. with
his group, along with one fighting monk. The D.S. motions for them to
line up as the monks had.D.S.You will train 6 days a week, from 5 am to 9 p.m.,
           alternating with work and meditation. Sunday afternoon is

Finally, after a high arcing back throw, a real thumper, the worst of

Before anyone can move, however, Drew raises his hand as high as he
can, obviously in pain.DREW (CONT'D)I'm not sure I got that last throw clear in my mind.

Drew attacks, and the D.S. executes the manuever perfectly, crashingDrew down almost on his head. Luckily, Drew is able to twist at the
last moment and take the impact on his already bruised shoulder. He
moans and groans and lies there.DREW (CONT'D)I think I've got it now. Xie Xie!

as he takes a hand off the handle of the umbrella, the water slams
him and off he goes into the pool.

off balance. He throws another punch out, and Gao grabs it and pulls.

Drew makes an acrobatic catch and then flicks it back to Li, harder
than he should have. It heads for an ancient statue and smacks it
dead center, right in the face.
The statue starts to tip!
Drew and Li rush for the statue and catch it, just before it tips
over and smashes on the ground.
They look at each other, thanking their lucky stars the statue didn't
fall. They start to throw the frisbee again, when Drew spots the D.S.
coming towards them.
Drew stashes the frisbee in his shirt and grabs the brooms.

He tosses one to Li and they just begin sweeping again when the D.S.
rounds the corner.

His broom is going over the depressions where the monks train, and
soon he loses his desire to sweep. He takes the broom in his hand as
a weapon and starts to spin it, going through a martial arts form,
his feet moving naturally into the depressions in the floor.
He finishes with a flourish, having moved into a shadowy area in a
corner, and then bows to an imaginary crowd, using the broom as a
microphone.DREW(imitating an announcer)

Drew stops her with a finger on her lips, then strokes her cheek.DREWAshema, beautiful Ashema, I can't see you anymore. I
           will... miss you and remember you... always.

Ashema closes her eyes against the tears there, and buries her head
against Drew's shoulder.ASHEMAAre they making you do this?
She wants to hear that they are, even if it's not true. She NEEDS to
hear it.

Drew pulls her head away from his shoulder, looking into her eyes. It
would be so easy not to take the blame for hurting her like this.DREWNo. It is my choice, and my responsibility. I'm sorry...

deep breath. He does not tense up his arm and shoulder.

Gao looks questioning at the D.S.GAOWhat if I hurt him?D.S.You will not.

Gao starts to pull down, gently at first, but when he sees that the
old monk's arm is not bending, stronger, until finally he is putting
all his strength into it. The old monk's arm has not moved, and his
expression of relaxation and piece has not changed.

out. He takes off sprinting, with    Gao covering him like a blanket.

tries to avoid getting hit. Drew catches a haymaker, and he spins and
drops, and the thugs laugh, kick him a couple of times, and then kick
dust and dirt onto him. Drew doesn't get up.

The father tries to fight back, but they easily beat him up, sending
him into the dirt. The young boy runs forward. The leader of the

Before he can bring his arm forward, Drew's fingers come around his
wrist, stopping it.DREW (CONT'D)Oh, I don't think so...ANGLE ON THE CROWDIt's getting good now.

a beautiful woman standing next to where he left his clothes.

Drew starts to get out of the lake, then remembers that he is naked �
he stops, not quite knowing what to do. He goes as close to the shore
as he can without coming out of the water.

jump from place to place and make it across.DREWJust like at the temple...
He starts out, jumping onto the first stone, then moving on to the
others. He almost falls a couple of times, but regains his balance.
He gets a rythm going, and is soon almost halfway across.
He gets to one particular rock, only to find out that it's the head

himself to look straight ahead.
He just starts across when the rope bends and jumps. Drew turns
around to see a man RIGHT BEHIND HIM.DREWIs this rope strong enough for both of us?
No answer from the man, who is now pushing Drew to go faster. He is
inching up closer to him, and occassionally kicking him to go
quicker.DREW (CONT'D)OK, OK, I'm going!ANGLE ON THE ROPE BEHIND THEMWhich is starting to fray from the weight.ANGLE ON DREWWho sees that and is hurrying.

The rope is fraying more, and when Drew is almost there, the rope
snaps and they both go swinging into the side of the mountain.ANGLE ON DREWWho slams into the wall hard. when he hits, the scroll POPS out of
his pocket and goes up in the air.

to the cliff wall with the BACK of his hand.ANGLE ON MANWho is barely hanging on, just below Drew.

           life. Guard it well.

Drew reaches down for the man's hand, letting the box fall.

becomes aware of a figure sitting on the ground near him.
He looks down, and it is the ARHAT!DREWMaster! I apologize, I did not see you.
The Arhat says nothing, but just puts out his hand for the scroll.
Drew bows again, and gets down on his knees.DREW (CONT'D)I failed, Master. A person was in danger...
The Arhat holds up his hand, and Drew stops talking.DREW (CONT'D)Of course, you're right. No excuses...

Drew bows once more and is ready to leave. The Arhat reaches into his
robes and pulls out the embroidered box that Drew was given at the
temple.DREW (CONT'D)You have it? How?

The Arhat holds up the box in front of Drew for a moment, then tears
it in two with his hands, scattering the pieces to the winds.DREW (CONT'D)So, I didn't fail, huh?

           I can ask my question, then?

The Arhat sits without moving or speaking. Drew takes that as a yes.DREW (CONT'D)What is the meaning of life?

The Arhat ponders that for a moment, then smiles and puts his sandles
on his head and stands up.ARHATWhat is life? What is reality? The head of a dead cat.
He walks off, leaving Drew sitting there, dumbstruck by the answer.DREW(smiling ruefully)I just climbed a mountain to ask a loon about the meaning
           of life.
He shakes his head and gets up, following the Arhat. The Arhat is
standing on the other side of his hut, the sandles still on his head.ARHATFor forty years, Shaolin disciples have made their quest

           never intended to live as a monk in the temple, you need
           not enter the chamber.ANGLE ON DREWWho rises to the challenge.DREWMaster San De, I am part of the disciple class, am I not?

are flanking Drew as he pauses in front of the door. Drew turns to
look at San De, and the D.S. smacks Drew in the back of the head.DREW (CONT'D)What did you do that for?D.S.My last chance � when you come out the other side, we
           will be equals.
Drew smiles at the D.S.'s attempt to lighten him up. He turns to look
at the others from his disciple class, then opens the door and goes
through.INT. WOODEN MAN CHAMBER � SAME DAYESTABLISHING SHOT OF WOODEN MAN CHAMBER.Drew pauses for a moment,      examining the room. It is filled with
wooden statues of monks,      all in different fighting positions. The
carvings are precise and      incredibly beautiful. Their arms, open
hands, fists and legs are      fashioned out of hard wood, and they look
very dangerous indeed.

Drew gathers himself for a moment, then starts into the chamber.ANGLE ON DREW'S FOOTAs it presses down on one of the stones of the floor.

The attacks start � from all sides, as the wooden statues COME TO
LIFE, spinning, lunging and striking.

Drew is caught off guard, and is hit several times, driven back to
the door of the chamber. The statues stop moving.

Drew, a little scared, tries to remember the sequence of the statues,
letting his arms practice for the attacks.

There is fear in his eyes.

He starts in again, and the attacks come again, but they are
different this time.

Drew is clobbered.

Driven back to the door, Drew slumps against the wall. His face is
already bruised and bleeding.DREW(whispering)

it out in a breathing exercise.DREW (CONT'D)I am a Shaolin monk.
He enters the chamber again, and the attacks start again.
Drew, however, is prepared (both mentally and physically).
He blocks, avoids, rolls, jumps and redirects the attacks on him,
making his way across.
He is about halfway across when an especially fierce and large statue
comes crashing towards him. Drew, caught a little off guard, quickly
adjusts and manages to jump and spin out of the way.

Suddenly, as he turns and tries to get his breath, two huge, deadly
spears are streaking towards him. Drew blocks the SPEARS with his
arms, misdirecting them into the wall behind him.

They THWOCK into the wall, sticking there.

As he rounds a particularly difficult series of statues, a volley of
ARROWS comes HURTLING towards him. Drew blocks some, avoids others,
and catches one in each hand. He throws them down and continues on.

He goes past the few remaining statues, and is out of the Wooden Man
Chamber. All that is left is to walk down a little hallway and out
the door.

Drew looks behind him, then starts to walk. He goes cautiously,
expecting a trap or a trick.

Nothing happens.

He gets to the door and looks for a handle on the door. He spots a
handhold near the top of the door, and pulls it with his hand.

Immediately, his hands is locked in and a panel in the ceiling DROPS
right onto his arm, forcing it down. Drew fights back with his
muscles, the veins popping out in his arms and neck.
Behind him, a statue has started coming towards him, spinning like a
dervish. Its fists and legs are extended, and they are deadly.
The panel drops lower and lower.FLASHBACK TO UNBENDABLE ARM SEQUENCEANGLE ON DREWAs he relaxes his face, and forcibly relaxes his arm and entire body,

From out of the bamboo grove comes Ashema, her hands in front of her
and her head down. She is not sure Drew wants to see her.

Drew looks at her, then back to San De, but he is already gone. They
are alone.

Drew walks to her, takes her chin in his hand and tilts it up to look
at her face. Her eyes are full of love and tenderness, and a little
fear.

crazy, eager to see the match. Drew, oblivious to the crowd, walks
over to Trevor.DREWI came to the Shaolin Temple because of you, Trevor. You
           humiliated me, and I wanted to make sure it could never
           happen again.TREVORSo, let's see what you've learned.DREW(shaking his head)
           I've learned that... there's nothing to prove. Beating

           important for that.

Drew steps out of the ring and walks over to where San De is
standing. They bow, and the pride is shining in San De's eyes.SAN DEDo you turn away from him out of fear?ANGLE ON TREVORWho is seething.TREVORI thought the Shaolin monks were warriors, not babies!

He is pointing at Li and Gao and the others, who are itching to climb
into the ring. Gao goes over to San De, and shoots a questioning look
at Drew.GAOMaster, the American is insulting the Temple, and the
           fighting monks.SAN DE(looking at drew)

           What should be done?GAO (CONT'D)Someone should face him in combat. For the tradition of
           the temple.
San De looks at Drew long and hard.SAN DEThere are some times when a Shaolin must fight, and some
           people who will not learn until they are taught a lesson.ANGLE ON DREWWho understands the implication of what he is saying. He starts to
smile slowly.SAN DE (CONT'D)It's your call.
Drew nods, then turns to face the ring, where Trevor is still
standing, trying to get someone to fight him.
Drew walks with Gao back to the side of the ring. He turns to Gao and
Li and together they high-five.DREWFor the temple...
Drew climbs into the ring.

The crowd is going crazy. Trevor has a predator's grin on his face as
he sits down in his corner to get ready to start the match.

drinks, etc.ANGLE ON DREWWho sits alone in the other corner.ANGLE ON LI AND GAOWho see the difference. Immediately, they mobilize the other monks.ANGLE ON GAOWho pulls a drink from one of the men in the crowd, and rushes up to

(painfully), others are stretching his legs out, others waving towels
to bring air to him, etc.

The referee signals for the fighters to come to the center. They do,
and he motions for them to bow to each other.TREVORRemember last time, punk?DREWNothing exists but the moment, and...
                 (beat)

           ... I'm going to enjoy it.
They back up, and the fight begins.
Trevor attacks hard, but Drew avoids easily, using all soft gong fu.He continues to attack, throwing flashy technique after flashy
technique, but he can't touch Drew.TREVORStay still, dammit! Stand and fight!
And he dances out of the way. Trevor is getting more and more angry.
Soon, Drew tires of this game and decides to end this    quickly. He
goes after Trevor, and it is immediately obvious that    Trevor is
completely outclassed. Drew scores on Trevor at will,    and soon has
Trevor totally confused and helpless with a mixture of    high kicks,
takedowns, flips and punches.
Trevor drops to one knee, his hands down at his side, note even
bothering to defend himself.
Drew grabs Trevor by the front of his uniform and pulls back his
right hand in a fist. He is going to put him out with a good old-
fashioned roundhouse punch.ANGLE ON LI AND GAOYelling for the knock out blow.ANGLE ON D.S. AND SAN DEWorried about this latest development.

Instead, however, Drew smiles and lifts Trevor up and shakes his
hand, putting an arm around him to steady him in front of the crowd.

Trevor looks into Drew's face, wondering why Drew would do such a
thing. When he sees Drew's friendly face, he knows.

To teach him a lesson.

Trevor smiles and holds up Drew's hand as the champion.
