                                                    June 11, 2008FADE IN:INT. BACHELOR APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHTA modest city bedroom. Suitcases and half-unpacked boxes
          sit on one side of the room. Sc_-orLe's -moving in.
          In his bathrobe, PHIL FOSTER, a good looking guy in his
          mid-20's, hums to himself as he looks through stacks of
          WEDDING PICTURES organized all over the bed. Just as he
          finishes up a pile and starts another, beautiful CLARA
          FOSTER, in a bathrobe too, jumps across his lap.PHILHey, hey! Careful Clara! You were the
          one who told me not to mess up the
          precious picture piles!
          he gives him a long, slow kiss.PHIL (CONT ' D )Minty fresh.CLARAThat was nice.PHILIt was nice.CLARAHey from now on when you change the
          toilet paper, could you just make sure it
          is out?PHIL(CHUCKLES)Wow! She moves in and the honeymoon's
          over!CLARAOh, believe me, we're just getting
          started, Phil.PHIL(reaches into picture pile)
          Look at this one of your Mom with me. I
          mean that woman can't contain her 'Love!

          ON the wedding picture: RUTH, Clara's,mother, stands
          stiffly next to Phil with an expression like she's ankle
          deep in a manure bin.CLARA(LAUGHS)She just takes a while to warm up. You
          guys are gonna be best buddies. You
          picked a favorite of us yet?2.Phil finds the picture, handing it to Clara.CLARA (CONT'D)That's exactly the one I picked!

          Clara leans the photo on the night stand next to the bed.
          It's a PORTRAIT OF THEM FROM THEIR WEDDING. They look
          joyous, excited. A young couple with the world in front
          of them.PHILMan, I wish I was them.
          Phil kisses the back of Clara's neck, but her smile fades
          as she stares at the picture. He notices.PHIL (CONT'D)WHAT ISCLARAI just... when I was growing up my Mom
          and Dad had a picture just like this.
          Now they can't even acknowledge each
          other.
          Phil sympathetically gives her a squeeze.CLARA (CONT'D)Let's always remember to have some time
          that's just for the two of us. No matter
          what else comes up in our lives - if it's
          work or friends or when we have kids-PHILWe're having kids? With an "S"?(CLARA LAUGHS)OK fine. But I promise you it's never
          gonna happen to us.CLARAYeah, we'll see if you'll be saying that
          when I'm long in the tooth.PHILYou'll be even hotter long toothed.
          Right now to be honest Clara they're a
          little stumpy.CZ(GIGGLESOh really?
          As Phil climbs on top and kisses her, he reaches over and
          turns off the light. Suddenly, we hear the piles of
          pictures SLIDE OFF THE BED and hit the ground. Beat.CLARA (CONT'D)Phil. Tell me it wasn't the pictures.PHILwasn't the pictures.CLARAYou know how long that took?PHILWe'll fix the picture piles, Clara.
          We've got all the time in the world.
          From now on everything's gonna be just
          about us.
          Suddenly, a YOUNG VOICE breaks through the darkness.OLLIE (V.0.)MOM!The Talking Head's "Once in a Lifetime" kicksINT. PHIL AND CLARA'S BEDROOM 7 YEARS LATER - MORNINGNext to the framed wedding picture of Phil and Clara, an
          ALARM CLOCK on a side table reads 6:45 am.EOLLIE (O.S.)Mo-om!
          It's SEVEN YEARS LATER as Phil and Clara stir .-id groan
          in bed. Clara has the comforter WRAPPED ALL HER
          while Phil lies uncovered next to her in his boxers and a
          T-shirt. Without saying a word, they rise out of each
          side of their beds and sleepily march in opposite
          directions across their suburban bedroom- Clara down the
          hall and Phil to the bathroom.OLLIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)Mom! Mom! Mom!CLARAI'm coming, Ollie!INT. OLLIE'S ROOM - A LITTLE LATERAs the Talking Heads song continues, Clara makes Ollie's
          bed while OLLIE, 5, plays with LEGOs on the floor. Phil
          showered and dressed in a suit, walks quickly past the
          doorway carrying a briefcase, his eyes glued to a stack
          of PAPERS in his hand.CLARAUh Phil?0Phil doubles back, still looking at the papers.PHILYep?CLARAI need to switch. I've got an open
          house.
          Phil obviously doesn't want to be bothered right now, but
          contains it.PHILReally?CLARAYeah. Really.
          As Clara walks quickly past him, Phil claps his hands
          together.PHILOK, so I say today we go for the slacker
          look - cool yet approachable.OLLIEYeah, well Mom says that.
          Ollie points to a PREPPIE OUTFIT laid out on a chair.PHILOh. Well... that's cool too!INT. PHIL AND CLARA'S BEDROOM/BATHROOM - SAMEThe Talking Heads song continues as Clara walks quickly
          through the bedroom. She lets out a YELP as her shin
          SMASHES INTO PHIL'S DRESSER DRAWER - he's left them open.
          She kicks them closed and limps to the bathroom, then
          stops in the doorway. WATER covers the floor. Grabbing
          a towel, she tosses it down and shimmies to the mirror.
          As she picks up her toothbrush, she notices it's WET as
          well.CLARAEch. Mine.
          She re-rolls the toothpaste from the bottom up and starts
          brushing when she sees the sink - a Jackson Pollock of
          razor hairs and bits of toothpaste.
          Disgusted, Clara reaches for the Kleenex box, only to
          discover it's EMPTY. She tosses the box in the trash and
          shimmies on the towel to get some toilet paper.5Seeing the roll, she sighs as she takes it out of the
          holder, turns it around and puts it back so it ROLLS OUT.
          As the CREDITS END, the Talking Heads song fadNT. KITCHENPhil, pen in hand, is focused again on his papers as
          Ollie, now in the preppie outfit, watches him and waits
          at the table. Phil finally notices.PHILWhat?OLLIEBreakfast?PHIL(HOPPING UP)Oh. Yeah, sorry. Your Dad's a boob
          today. What's it gonna be?
          Ollie peers down the hallway to see if there's any sign
          of his tom.OLLIEHow about... some Captain Crunch?
          Phil gets an idea and writes zickly.PHIL(DISTRACTED)OLCaptain Crunch?The cereal?PHILUh... yeah. Sure.
          Phil grabs the Captain Crunch cereal box out
          cupboard and starts toward the table when Clara, dressed
          in a suit, comes into the room and spots it.CLARAAh ah ah... what's that Ollie? You had a
          bowl yesterday.IEBut Dad already said yeah sure.
          Clara glances at Phil.
          said it. I said itARCASTIC)(MORE)6PHIL (CONT'D)Yeah, sure! You know it's only one bowlA DAY-CLARA(CORRECTING HIM)A week.PHILOne bowl a day a week.
          Clara, eyebrows raised, eyes the Captain Crunch already
          in Phil's hand. Phil shakes the carton at Ollie.PHIL (CONT'D)This is not for you today!CLARA(CHUCKLES)Yeah right.PHIL(SHRUGS)Worth a try.CLARADid you get his lunch together?PHILOh. Whoops.CLARA(SIGHS)You just get his breakfast and I'll do
          it.
          As Phil takes out some Special K and pours milk for Ollie
          and a glass for himself, he finishes the carton. Peeking
          back over his shoulder, he sees Clara's dialing with the
          phone to her ear as she readies Ollie's lunch. He
          stealthily pours the TINIEST BIT of milk back, quickly
          returning the carton to the fridge.CLARA (CONT'D)(INTO PHONE)Hey Jane? I'm getting a late start but
          I'll be there as soon as I can.PHILSorry I dropped the ball. It's this
          Quarterly Report to Mr. Rivers today.
          You know how he freaks me out with all of
          his mixed animal metaphors that I don'tUNDERSTAND-CLARA(focusing on Ollie's lunch)
          Ollie, do you want a banana?7.PHILDid you hear me?CLARA(not looking at him)
          Uh huh. He freaks you out with his mixed
          animal metaphors that you don't
          understand. Banana Ollie?PHIL(BEAT)So I should probably get going. With the
          highway construction it takes forever to
          get downtown these days.CLARAOK. Have a good day.
          Phil kisses her on the cheek and Clara absently wipes it
          off. He looks at her strangely. Noticing, Clara quickly
          kisses Phil on the cheek.CLL. -- (CONT ' D )Sorry. Your mouthy was still ail milky.PHILSorry for the milky mouth.
          He heads out. With a sigh, Clara spots Phil's left his 1ï¿½1
          dirty glass on the counter. She cleans it in the sink,
          then gets the carton out of the fridge to put some milk
          in her own coffee. A DRIBBLE comes out. Shaking her
          head, she tosses the carton in the trash.EXT. FRONT OF FOSTER' S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATERAs Phil exits the front door and heads to the carport
          next to the house, his overly cheery neighbor CHAZ picks
          a newspaper off his lawn.CHAZ (O.S.)Well, well! We're up bright and early,
          aren't we!PHILYes we are!
          (under his breath)
          ike you say to me every morning.
          Reaching the carport, Phil scoots between his car and
          Clara's. He tries to open his driver's door, but Clara'
          car is parked TOO CLOSE and the door only opens a few
          inches. He tries to SQ'L'-Z- IN, but ends up GETTING
          STUCK halfway.8PHIL (CONT'D)OW! OW! OW!Dislodging himself, Phil sidesteps between the cars and
          peers around the other side of Clara's. TONS of room.
          Shaking his head, Phil crosses to his car's passenger
          side. OPEN HOUSE BANNERS piled in the garage block the
          front passenger door. Frustrated, Phil hops in the rear
          and grunts as he climbs diagonally over to the driver's
          seat.HONKING.EXT. EISENHOWER HIGHWAY - A LITTLE LATERThe Eisenhower Highway is a parking lot as ROAD
          CONSTRUCTION blocks 3 out of 4 lanes. In the middle of
          it, Phil checks his watch, frustrated. Peering out his
          window, he looks at a billboard of a smiling older man in
          slick suit and construction hat. The sign reads MAYORDIGGS APPRECIATES YOUR PATIENCE WHILE WE BUILD OURHIGHWAY TO THE FUTURE! Phil scowls, then checks his
          watch.EXT. STREETEClara and JANE, another sharply dressed realtor in her
          30's, walk down the street putting up OPEN HOUSE ARROW
          SIGNS on the sidewalk.JANEHis name's Juan and he's some kind of
          Spanish, I think. He knows all these
          exclusive, underground places downtown.
          It's so exciting. And in bed...(WHISPERS)I never knew I could still get my leg
          back that far.CLARAToo much information, Jane.INT. OPEN HOUSEClara and Jane speak loudly to each other as they each
          move quickly around different parts of the vacant home,
          cleaning and inspecting.
          The divorce was the best thing that ever
          happened to me. Seriously. You know
          that great nervous feeling in your
          stomach? Where you don't know what's
          going to happen next?9On her way down the hall, Clara spots a mark up ahead on
          the wall. She reaches into her large purse and pulls out
          a mini-409 mister and a rag. With the aim of a
          SHARPSHOOTER, she sprays ahead, wiping the mark as she
          passes.JANE (O.S.) (CONT'D)With Larry, I lost that. Everything had
          just become routine, you know? Boring.
          Jane's words hit Clara close to home. Passing on through
          the kitchen, Clara notices that the REFRIGERATOR makes a
          weird, loud buzzing noise.JANE (CONT'D)But now, all of a sudden I'm alive again!CLARAGood for you, Jane.
          Clara takes out her frustration on the ridge, kicki
          the side and silencing it.CLARA (CONT'D)Good for you.T. FRONT HALLWAY - A LITTLE LClara and Jane sit on the floor, together
          prospectuses.JANEThere's this g---eat restaurant downtown we
          went to the ot__ar night that you guys
          would love. _"st amazing view of the
          city. You guys should check it out on
          your next date night.CLARA(focusing on stapling)
          Yeah, well, maybe. We don't really have
          those that much anymore.JANE't have date nights:CLARA(shrugs),
          You know, we're pretty tired all the time
          between work and Ollie. And some of the
          shows on TV these days are really great.
          Ah. I see.10.1Ï¿ï¿½1They staple in silence for a second. Jane and Clara look
          at each other.CLAMI know that's really lame.JANESo it's Phil?CLARA(SIGHS)No, it's not Phil. It's the both of us.
          I don't know. It just... happened.JANESo why don't you change it? All you have
          to do is stir things up and have one
          great, sexy, exciting night again.CLARAI guess. Maybe.JANENot maybe. Tonight.CLARANah. Tonight's no good.Âï¿½JANEWhy not? Seriously think about it.
          What's really gonna be more important
          tonight than that?
          Clara takes this in. Jane's right.INT. CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGEChecking his watch, Phil shakes his head as he rushes
          through the large bullpen of the Chicago Mercantile
          Exchange. In the pits all around him, BUYERS and SELLERS
          scream out their orders.INT. MR. RIVERS' OFFICEIn a dark wood office with STUFFED AR 'ï¿½ L HEADS lining
          the walls, a young, smartly dressed man in his 20's,
          GEORGE, quietly goes through a binder with MR. RIVERS,
          60, at the older man's desk. As Phil bursts in they both
          look over.PHILI'm sorry I'm late. The construction on
          the highways is insane these days!MR. RIVERSDon't worry about it, Phil. It's fine.
          Catch your breath.
          George gives Mr. Rivers an ornate, pal-sy handshake, then
          heads out with the binder, nodding at Phil. Phil nods
          back warily, then takes out his binder, ready to launch
          into his report.MR. RIVERS (CONT'D)Uh, Phil. Listen, before we start...
          I've been thinking... this next quarter
          we need to venture into open tundra.
          Start really ripping the meat.PHIL(beat, trying to decipher)
          Uh. OK. You mean... take the fund in a
          more high risk direction?MR.Yeah. That's wha: I - -aid.
          Sure. OK, fine. I can work up some
          higher risk options and come back
          tomorrow.Âï¿½MR. RIVERS(CLEARS THROAT)OK. The thing is Phil, tomorrow I want
          George to give me his thoughts on where
          we need to be hunting too.PHILOh.MR. RIVERSs nothing personal.(BEAT)So let me get this straight. You're
          telling me that tomorrow I'm going to
          have to interview for the job I already
          have? Against George?MR. RIVERSI wouldn't put it like that. I Just need
          our pack leader to be more like... like a
          momma kangaroo. Ya get me?PHILKinda.(BEAT)Actually, no. Not really at all.12.MR. RIVERSThe blind baby kangaroo opens its mouth
          and knows its momma's teat is just always
          there, ready to suckle. But at the same
          time, momma kangaroo's still a wild,
          dangerous creature.PHILSorry. Still not totally getting you.MR. RIVERSI've had a wife and a family. Three of
          them. It's hard to stay the fastest
          cheetah when you need to mind the pack,
          Phil. George lives in the city, doesn't
          have a family to worry about. He can rip
          the meat.PHILListen, Mr. Rivers. I don't need to...
          I was ripping big bloody hunks of meat
          and eating them like tartare when George
          was still... in the jungle!MR. RIVERS(BEAT)What does that mean?PHILI can't be demoted, Mr. Rivers. I just
          can't.MR. RIVERSListen, nothing's set. It's just I gotta
          say that lately your leadership on this
          has felt a little... well... tame.PHIL(GETTING UP)That's all you needed to say, Mr. Rivers!
          I'll see you tomorrow.
          Determined, Phil marches out of Mr. River's office.SCHOOLClara talks on her cellphone as she picks up Ollie from
          school.CLARASo it's OK if we drop him off at 7? Our
          reservation's at 7:45.
          She passes another MOTHER desperately searching for a
          Kleenex for her BOY with snot dripping from his nose.13.Without breaking stride, Clara reaches into her purse and
          hands the grateful mother a tissue, then takes out a mini-
          bottle of Purell and cleans her hands.CLARA (CONT'D)(INTO PHONE)Thanks Mom. I really appreciate it.FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)Mrs. Foster?
          Clara turns to see Ollie's teacher, the tight buttoned
          MRS. CARDIGAN, 45, walking toward her in the parking lot.CLARAOh, that's Ollie's teacher. I'll see you
          later.
          Clara hangs up her phone and greets Mrs. Cardigan with a
          warm smile.CLARA (CONT'D)I've been meaning to tell you that you
          can just call me Clara, Mrs. Cardigan.MRS. CARDIGANI'd prefer Mrs. Foster. Boundaries
          matter.CLARA 1Ï¿ï¿½1OK...MRS. CARDIGANCan we speak a moment? Alone?CLARASure, sure. Ollie, go to the car.
          As Ollie does, Clara turns back to Mrs. Cardigan.CLARA (CONT'D)Is everything OK?MRS. CARDIGANWell, I'm afraid not. Oliver's been
          antagonizing the girls in the class a
          great deal lately. Especially Jenny
          Diggs.CLARAReally? Oh no. Why do you think that's
          happening?MRS. CARDIGANI'm going to leave that to you and your
          nd to figure out. But beyond that,
          ,i: overall attitude these days is
          just... sub par. E(MORE)14.MRS. CARDIGAN (CONT'D)His penmanship is sloppy. He lacks
          motivation and tries to just "get by" o
          assignments. You know, this is a very
          competitive school, Mrs. Foster. In my
          opinion, maybe you should consider
          whether this is really the right
          environment for him.CLARA(beat, stunned)
          Uh... wow. OK.
          Mrs. Cardigan starts away. Clara climbs into the car,
          watching Mrs. Cardigan.CLARA (CONT'D)(under her breath)
          Wow. What a bitch.OLLIEDid you just call Mrs. Cardigan a bitch?CLARA(remembering Ollie's in theBACK)No.OL LIEYeah you did.Âï¿½CLARAI didn't. I really didn't.
          Clara quickly pulls out.CAR PORT - LATERPhil SQUEEZES out of his drivers seat with folders full
          of RESEARCH. As he walks toward the house he spots the
          TONS of room on the other side of Clara's car and shakes
          his head.PHILUnbelievable!INT. OLLIE'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATERStill carrying his research, Phil peeks in on Ollie, who
          packs a suitcase.PHILHey buddy. Finally moving out? I gotta
          tell you it's about time.OLLIE0I'm going to Nana's tonight.15.PHILOn a school night? Why?OLLIE(SHRUGS)Mom says you guys are going out.PHILTonight? What? No.(CALLS OUT)Clara?INT. PHIL AND CLARA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATERPhil marches into the bedroom.PHILClara? Cl-
          He stops in the doorway as he spots her. Made up in an
          evening dress in front of a full length mirror, Clara
          looks STUNNING as she finishes putting an earring on.PHIL (CONT'D)Wow. Wow.
          Clara tns and smiles.ISCLARAI thought I could take you out to
          celebrate you finally getting that report
          in. A romantic dinner downtown like the
          old days, and teen...
          (raises :,er eyebrows)
           Ollie's going to stay at Mom's so we have
           the house all to ourselves. All night.PHILWow... It sounds... great.CLARAGreat!
          She turns back and continues getting ready.PHILIt's just... is there any chance we coul
          take a rain check?CLARA(TURNS)A "rain check"?PHILYeah. Unfortunately I really need to do
          a bit of work tonight. E16.CLARAI thought all the cramming was for this
          report today. Did something go wrong?PHIL(BEAT)Uh, no. Nothing like that. I just
          decided I could play with it a little
          more. Make it a little better.
          Clara takes him in a moment.CLARAOh. OK.
          Controlling herself, Clara starts putting her jewelry

          You know it. That's the thing, Phil. We
          used to do things on the spur of the
          moment all the time. Even after Ollie

          out of this and call my Mom then.
          As Clara heads into the closet, Phil looks after her,
          feeling terrible. About to leave, he notices that around
          the room, Clara's SET UP CANDLES in anticipation of their
          romantic night. He looks down again at the papers in his
          hand and sucks in, conflicted.INT. CLOSET - MOMENTS LATERAs Clara starts to take her dress off, Phil scoots past

          day. She's totally healthy and
          everything's normal with the pregnancy.
          So she goes into labor and walks into the

          makes my... never mind.
          Phil reaches over and turns up the air again. Tapping
          his fingers on the wheel with a sigh, he gets fed up,

          Clara shuts her vents, once again sending a POWERFUL GUST

          leaves it blowing on him as they drive.INT. THE SIGNATURE ROOMPhil and Clara rush off the elevator and enter the

          birthday, or slipping her some money-PHILOh, I see. Lying and graft were the
          answer!
          Clara shakes her head, then notices the YOUNG HOST
          searching for the party and starts focusing on him

          SMASH! - they HIT something head-on, SHATTERING the
          windshield.
           Shaking glass off himself, Phil peers forward. They're
          face to face - nose to nose - with another broken
          windshield. In the driver's seat of a SOUPED UP HONDA
          h fiber-optic colored lights, a YOUNG BLACK DUDE â¢
          stares at them in shock.BLACK DUDENo no no. Tell me you did not just do

          The Black Dude gets out of his car to inspect, head in

          Phil throws the car into reverse, but his tires just
          screech smoke, the wheels spinning in place.

          I think I got whiplash and shit.
          A SCREECH. Phil looks back to see FRANK AND HARRY'S
          TOTnNCAR coming around the corner.PHILShit.
          Thinking fast, Phil jumps out of his car and hops into
          the Black Dude's souped up Honda.BLACK DUDEHey! HEY! What do you think you're
          doing?
          The Black Dude chases after him, trying the driver's
          door, but Phil's LOCKED it. Phil yells to Clara.PHILPUT IT IN REVERSE AND GUN IT, CLARA!CLARAWhat? That's insane!EFrank and Harry's car SPEEDS TOWARDS THEM. It will smash
          into them in seconds...PHILI KNOW IT IS! BUT DO IT!Freaked, Clara hops to the driver's seat and switches to
          reverse, and guns it. At the same moment, Phil steps on
          the gas.
          The Black Dude, hanging onto the driver's door, SCREAMS
          as he's THROWN ONTO THE HOOD. The conjoined cars SHIMMY
          SHAMMY BACKWARD, just in time to dodge the Towncar. The
          Black Dude scrambles for his life through the windshield
          into the passenger's seat next to Phil.BLACK DUDEJESUS CHRIST! WHAT'S THE MATTER WITHYOU?!!PHILNOW PUT IT IN DRIVE!CLARAHuh?BLACK DUDEJESUS! JESUS!77.PH ILPUT IT IN DRIVE NOW!CLARAPhil, this is-BLACK DUDEJESUS JESUS!PHILDO IT!(to Black Dude)AND YOU! CUT THE JESUS!Mumbling angrily, Clara puts her car in drive and steps
          on it. Their cars lurch then burn asphalt as the wheels
          smoke and speed up in the OTHER DIRECTION. They race
          past Frank again, who angrily whips the Towncar around in
          pursuit.
          Looking over his shoulder, Phil tries to steer their
          conjoined cars down the middle of the street, but he and
          Clara are out of sync and their attached cars veer :ildly
          back and forth. They hit the curb at an angle and -JcK

          across the road. An ONCOMING SUV honks desperately.PHIL (CONT'D)Ahhhh! Other way! Other way!78.Flustered, Clara WHIPS her wheel in the other direction,
          and their two cars tilt up on four wheels (out of eight),
          barely screeching past.
          Landing again and taking in a deep breath, Phil shoots

          Finally, they hit the other side. Getting his bearings,
          Phil sees the Towncar has entered the park after them.
          He searches where to go next, then spots something.PHILClara! Reverse it, keep it straight

          rings out.LIEUTENANT MANNINGThe next one won't be a warning shot.
          They look over to see Manning training a gun as he and
          Stockton walk toward them, Harry and Frank behind with
          the plastic.MR. STOCKTON(to Harry and Frank
          Let's do it over there.

          the grass nearby.MAYOR DIGGSI'm going to wait in the c r
          don't mind.MR. STOCKTONSure thing, Mr. Mayor.EAs Mayor Diggs starts to walk back to the parking lot, he
          opens the manila envelope. Manning gestures for Phil and
          Clara to walk to the plastic sheets.PHILPlease. Please don't doLIEUTENANT MANNINGOver there.PHILPlease! We have a child!'VT MININGsaid over there!ï¿½J PH I L(BEGGING)Just me then, OK? I promise you she's
          not going to say anything! Please! We
          have a child!LIEUTENANT MANNINGLast time I'm going to say it.
          Resigned, Phil and Clara sadly look at each other, then
          walk to stand in front of the plastic on the ground.1Ï¿ï¿½1LIEUTENANT MANNING(CONT'D)On your knees.
          Phil, scared, holds out his hand to Clara. She takes
          looking back at him and they kneel in front of the
          plastic, side by side.
          Mr. Stockton nods to Lieutenant Manning, who checks his
          gun.M A Y O R DIG GS (O . S . )WHAT THEMr. Stockton and Lieutenant inning turn. Mayor Diggs
          sifts through pages of DOCJ J:TTS that were in t h ''w Wila

          pictures, Mr. Mayor. That is, until you
          -.sre so casual about is not needing to
          worry about the cop who was after us.
          That made me a little suspicious because
          I never told you which cop it was.CLARAThen we got to talking and realized how
          dumb we were.(MORE)102.CLARA (CONT'D)E If you came on to some waitress at the
          Rainbow, you must have felt pretty darn
          comfortable there.PHILWhich meant Stockton was probably your
          buddy.MR. STOCKTONWhere are the pictures?PHILBut we were still confused, because if
          you guys are buddies, how do you explain
          the Falconwood Corporation?
          Mr. Stockton's face blanches.MR. STOCKTONThey're obviously not going to tell us!

          you've got there, he owns Falconwood.CLARANot only that, you'll see those other
          pages that he also owns a cc=rpany called
          Eurostruct - which rents the city all of
          its construction equipment.MR. STOCKTONFrank, Harry!
          Frank and Harry reach for their guns, but Manning turns
          his gun on them.E103.PHILThe more violations Falconwood finds, the
          longer Eurostruct rents the equipment.
          That turns into big bucks, Mr. Mayor.
          I'm sure that's not a moral problem for
          you, but he's kind of screwing you in an
          election year, isn't he? Some of us are
          pretty pissed off about the roads.

          even go there!PHIL( `TIKES HEAD)Listen to them.
          Stockton angrily pulls his own the gun out of his jacket
          pocket, shoving it against the back of Phil's neck.MR. STOCKTONHow did you get this? How?HOLBROOKE (O.S.)Tha be from me.
          Mr. Stockton and others turn around to see HOLBROOKE

          With a smile Phil and Clara get up, disconnecting the
          WIRES under their clothing. Seeing them hand over the
          wires to Holbrooke, it hits Mayor Diggs what he's just
