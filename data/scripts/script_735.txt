"Man On Fire"OPENING TITLE SEQUENCEEXT.   MEXICO CITY - DAYHigh over the city on a bright Sunday morning, the sun
pounding its way through the orange haze of smog. As we
descend toward the clots of traffic blocking the streets:
the sounds of a Mass being sung.A CATHOLIC CHURCHThe big wooden doors open to release the parishioners
inside. Feature a tall, lanky 18-YEAR-OLD. Holding his
GIRLFRIEND'S hand, anxious for Sunday to really begin.
They don't notice the traffic suddenly thin, like a
faucet's been cranked down. They move toward a Mercedes
500. As a CHAUFFEUR holds the back door open for them...A GRAND MARQUISSqueals around the corner, lurches to a stop alongside
the Mercedes. FOUR MEN get out flashing  badges. In a
moment they're hustling Eighteen toward the car, stiff-
arming the chauffeur. As the girlfriend  cries and the
gossip among the parishioners begins...

The Grand Marquis pulls away.INT.   GRAND MARQUIS - DAYThey shove eighteen down to the floor of the backseat.
These guys are not the police.

A switchblade is flicked open. Practiced hands slit the
boy's Sunday suit from the base of his neck to his heels.
Eighteen yelps as the blade draws blood across one calf.

Duct tape is wrapped around his hands, eyes, and head.EXT.   WOODED AREA - DAYThe Marquis is parked across from another CAR. FOUR NEW
GUYS wait as Eighteen is hauled out of the Marquis. His
clothes drop away like a snake shedding its skin. He
stands naked, bound and blind. Eighteen is handed over
from one group to the other.INT. TELEPHONE - UPSCALE HOME - MEXICO CITY - DAYThe phone rings. A bomb going off. Eighteen's
distraught FATHER (family photos of the boy on the wall)

REVERSE TO REVEAL a battery of POLICE and NEGOTIATORS in
the room with him. One of them listens in, waves fingers
at him as the negotiations begin.INT.   VIDEO SURVEILLANCE OF AN 8' X 4' CELL - DAYA wall smeared with God-knows-what. Facing   it, Eighteen
stands naked blindfolded and shivering. The   back of his
leg still bleeds. He shifts nervously as a   little JACK
RUSSELL TERRIER eagerly licks the blood off  his calf.

A MAN ('The Dreamer'), we don't see his face, negotiates
by cell phone. Voice calm. As he runs numbers, he slaps
his thigh. Jack Russell trots over, gets an ear
scratched.

At a motion from the man, Eighteen is taken down to the
ground. Straddled by two men, his head is mummified in
tape leaving one ear exposed.

CUT TO T.V. - Rosanna Garcia Guerrero, editor of REFORMA
newspaper, being interviewed, "...organized crime
syndicates...growth of kidnapping in Mexico over the last
two years."EXT.   UPSCALE HOUSE - DAYAs a hand removes a ziplock baggie from the mailbox. A
glimpse of something we don't want to see. An ear
partially obscured by sweating plastic and a blood smear.EXT.   CITY SQUARE - MEXICO CITY - NIGHTA MERCEDES driving around the square, Eighteen's father
waving a white shirt out the window like a surrender
flag.EXT.   BRIDGE - NIGHT (3 AM)Footbridge over railway sandwiched between freeway.
Empty train blazes through. Dangerous, deserted downtown
neighborhood. Looks more like "war torn Beirut", burnt
out cars and trash. The 18 year old's father, naked to
the waist, walks from the family Mercedes over the
footbridge carrying a pillowcase full of cash to a semi-
derelict car on the opposite side with a white piece of
fabric taped in the rear windshield and trunk open. He
slams the pillow case in the trunk and leaves.EXT.   DOWNTOWN MEXICO CITY - TWILIGHTRUSH HOUR. A red stream of headlights separated from a
white stream of taillights by a narrow median.Work in Progress 2/10/03                                        3.


HORNS blare as a CAR stops. Eighteen, still blindfolded,
is dumped on the median. The car pulls away.

He stands there in the whirlwind. Pathetically SCREAMING
for help. More horns, shouts, no help.

             name of charity and good will shepherds
             the weak through the valley of darkness
             for he is truly his brother's keeper and
             the finder of lost children.DISSOLVE TO:INT.   AGO'S - MEXICO CITY - DAYSamuel Valencia Ramos and his lawyer Jordan Kalfus in the
privacy of an alcove table. Jordan is well heeled, well
connected and well oiled. In that order. Samuel, at 40,
already has the patrician look that has served the male
members of his family for generations. They discuss the
kidnapping, a headline on the paper Jordan tosses aside.JORDANThe family paid the ransom and he was
             returned two days later.
                    (laughs; chews)
             His father still hasn't gotten up the
             nerve to ask him if they fucked him up
             the ass.SAMUELAnd now every mother with money in Mexico
             City wants bigger and better bodyguards.
             My own wife included.JORDANIf she pisses you off, you get another one.SAMUEL(laughs grimly)
             Do you know what she told me last night?FLASH TO:INT.   SITTING ROOM - RAMOS VILLA - MEXICO CITY - NIGHTSamuel sits at his baby    grand piano playing a gentle
rendering of 'Delibes'.     His American wife LISA stands
away from him. Just the     sight of her back reveals a
pitch perfect petulance.    She tells him:Work in Progress 2/10/03                                       4.LISAA man's worth can be judged by what he
             has or what he owes. Only the amount
             matters.SAMUELAnd bankruptcy. Where will that put me
             in the social strata?LISAI'm only asking for one thing. And it's
             not an extravagance. It's not even for
             me; it's for our daughter.SAMUELOur daughter.

She turns at that: a woman so beautiful it nearly hurts
to look at her. She stares, plays him like Chinese
Checkers.LISAOur child's safety is at stake.SAMUEL(stops playing)
             These people are professionals. They
             don't waste their time taking children
             whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.LISASamuel, it is not something we should
             skimp on. A bodyguard's presence in the
             car or outside the school was at least
             some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I
             feel totally exposed.

She just stares at him.    He melts.RETURN TO:INT.   AGO'S - MEXICO CITY - DAYJordan smiles at his client, enjoys seeing him squirm.SAMUELOf course I care about Pinta. She'll be
             as beautiful as her mother one day.JORDANYeah?   And if she was ugly?

Samuel rolls his eyes. Jordan laughs.       Beheading two
cigars, he passes one to Samuel.Work in Progress 2/10/03                                5.JORDANAll my clients have kidnap and ransom
            insurance.SAMUELI have a policy, AIG. It covers me and
            my family and when it runs out in sixty
            days, without a bodyguard, I will not be
            able to renew it.JORDANI know you need to please Lisa. An ass
            like that is hard to find. Good
            bodyguards are even harder.SAMUEL(interrupts)
            I know! I just had to let one go because
            I couldn't afford him!

Jordan lights his cigar.JORDANYou need a bodyguard of some description.
            It's a dangerous world we live in. But
            you will get what you pay for. He
            doesn't need to be Superman, does he?
            Can you go fifteen grand?SAMUELFor a year?JORDANFor a few months. Hire someone cheap.
            You have to have a bodyguard to keep the
            insurance. Then fire him for
            incompetence. The important thing is
            Lisa's daughter will return to school.

Samuel finally follows the logic.SAMUELAnd Lisa will be able to save face.    We
            won't be the only family without a
            bodyguard.JORDANHer beauty fucks with your mind.SAMUELFor an American she understands this
            country very well.Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   6.JORDANShe understands men.

As Samuel puffs his cigar in satisfaction...EXT.    CORRIDOR - MEXICO CITY AIRPORT - DAYAs a 747 is towed by in the background, a MAN strides at
us. CREASY. Even in movement, he has a stillness, an
air of isolation. He's set apart from other living
things.

He wears dark sunglasses, carries a well-worn leather
bag. Inscrutable. Disconnected. A bit frightening.
The discipline of a soldier. The independence of a
gunslinger.

Automatic baggage teller (Red Light, Green Light).
Creasy feeds the machine with his perforated customs
card. Light flashes RED.CUSTOMS MANHe flips through Creasy's passport. Even the stamps have
stamps. Thailand. Somalia. Cuba. Columbia. Hong
Kong. Saudi Arabia. Every country in Europe. Guy's
been around.

deep matte black of Creasy's sunglasses.

Customs looks at Creasy a moment. He doesn't look like a
man who has 'friends'. Finally, customs smiles.Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   7.CUSTOMSI cannot see your eyes, Senor.

Creasy slips off the sunglasses. His eyes are deserted.
Inevitable. Customs can only look into them a moment.
He indicates for Creasy to put his bags on a conveyor
belt leading to an X-ray machine. Creasy lifts his bag
onto the conveyor. The official hits the start button.
The bag drives forward towards the X-ray machine.

Creasy pauses, then offers up a license from his wallet.CUSTOMSSenor?CREASYIt's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia.
             The gun you're about to find in that
             suitcase.

starts to oil the weapon.

out two metal tubes that he screws together. It's a

He takes a Colt Officer model .45 semi-automatic pistol
out of his waistband and lays it on the table in
preparation for something, we don't know what. He turns
to Lisa.CREASYI'm going to tell you a story. Your

             into his U.S. bank account. Colonel
             Ernesto Tazinari is also dead. He
             hijacked the ransom drop, another $2.5
             million. If my arithmetic is correct it

Through all of the above, Creasy removes the special
bullet held in the seam of his wallet. The misfire.     He
empties the other cartridges from his gun.

Lisa suddenly attacks Samuel in a violent, emotional
outburst of tears, screaming, and rage. Drawing blood
from his nose and upper lip. Samuel smothers Lisa's arms
beneath his. He appears strong and decisive for the
first time.

Creasy very carefully takes the bullet, puts it into the
magazine and chambers the round. He looks into Samuel's
eyes.CREASYA bullet does not lie. A bullet tells

He disconnects.   He cannot waste his ebbing strength.EXT. BRIDGE OF THE AZTECS - SUNSETDarkness has fallen. Few people are on the street as
Creasy pulls to the south end of the bridge. He parks...
looks around... it's deserted. She's not coming. Checks
his watch, turns and walks toward the bridge. The Ramos
Mercedes drives up the bridge. Headlights off. Lisa is
driving. She exits the car.

She runs to catch Creasy.LISACreasy... Wait.CREASYStay here. If you do something stupid,

Creasy waits. Breathing labored breaths. He sees it all.OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGEThe driver unties little hands. Removes a blindfold from
under the hood. He steps away. Offering no help.

The small figure is confused.CREST OF THE BRIDGECreasy calls out:CREASYPinta.   Pinta.

She turns and looks. It looks remarkably like her even
under the hooded sweatshirt. She begins to run. Across
the street, up the steps toward Creasy. A screaming
train flashes beneath. Car headlights illuminate the
bridge.

Time stands still and the 'city sounds' fade out to
nothing.

She runs up the remaining stairs and sprints across the
bridge. Her hood blows off revealing her full face.
It's definitely Pinta. Camera ramps as he jumps into
Creasy's arms. This is not the little girl we
experienced in the beginning of the movie. The
experience she just endured has been life changing. All
of a sudden we have a 40 year old head on an 8 year old
body.

She wraps herself around him. He picks her up.     We
glimpse a simple tear on his cheek. They talk.     But we
do not hear the words.

She notices her mom on the far side of the bridge.
Creasy maneuvers her toward Lisa.

Before she goes to her mother we hear:PINTAI love you, Creasy... And you love me,
               right?

Creasy nods.    The inference is that he will see her in a
few minutes.

We start to hear Linda Ronstadt painfully, quietly on the
wind singing "Blue Bayou." He continues to walk across
to the opposite side of the bridge and gets into the
kidnappers' car.Work in Progress 2/10/03                                          125.


There's a certain sort of calm of him.
He closes the door, he lays his head against the back
window. He looks out at PINTA at the other side of the
bridge, where she's screams for Creasy. "Blue Bayou"
gets LOUDER. Pinta now knows it was a lie. Creasy is
not coming back. We're shooting through the glass of the
back window. We se Mexico City reflected in the glass.
As the car pulls out, time slows, and we see Creasy lay
his head back and close his eyes as the car descends down
into a dark tunnel.

Pinta can see Creasy's face, eyes slowly closing. He can
hear her screams before being enveloped by the night. As
"Blue Bayou" continues...EXT.    MEXICO CITY STREETS - DAYDark spot in the road. Suddenly Police lights, on the

The car enters the gates. A collection of armed bodies
appear in the courtyard curious to see this national
hero. "Hombre en Fuego."

The car stops. Nothing. This beat seems interminable.
A hand opens the rear door: His forehead explodes. The
driver door opens barely two shots, two more bodies drop.

Panic and confusion. Everybody runs for cover. An
overhead helicopter illuminates the mayhem in the
courtyard. An armored vehicle rams through the gates.

Manzano explodes out of the driver's door in slow motion.
He is clearly on a mission. He strides through the
mayhem, Creasy's Sig Sauer in one hand, and a .45 auto in
the other.

Manzano's guide to his destination is the 'The Dreamer's'
little Jack Russell running back to his master on
instinct.

Manzano moves purposefully. His surrounding environment
is Chaplinesque in its chaos. He enters a long walkway
to a patio, following the dog. Daniel Sanchez appears at
the end of the hall. We ramp him into slow motion. The
