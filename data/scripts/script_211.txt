THE BOONDOCK SAINTSWritten byTROY DUFFYShooting Script:  White August 28, 1997INT.  GOTHIC CHURCH  10:00 A.M.  ST. PATRICK'S DAYDOWNTOWN BOSTONAs we open we see the inside of an enormous church. A young 
               looking PRIEST in his mid-thirties is finishing the delivery 
               of the Lordï¿½s Prayer. In the back of the church, in the last 
               pew, there are two who kneel on the cold, stone floor.

               They do not stand to sing, nor do they offer signs of peace 
               when told, but they pray. They grip and rub their rosaries. 
               They mutter their words in Latin.

               CONNOR and MURPHY MacMANUS (mid-twenties) are shrouded in 
               thick waist length navy P-coats, worn leather boots and the 
               hungry clothes of the poor. The boys heads are shaved and 
               they have facial hair.MONSIGNOR(dismissing young 
                              priest)
                         Thank you Father Macklepenny, for 
                         coming all the way across town to be 
                         our guest speaker today. I hope you 
                         found our little parish to your 
                         liking.

               Macklepenny takes his seat on the alter along side the regular 
               priests of the church. The MacManus brothers suddenly stand, 
               as all others remain seated. Each church goer between them 
               and the aisle shifts his/her position to allow the boys 
               passage, as if on command. The two turn and begin to stride 
               for the alter, eyes down, determined.ANNABELLE MACMANUS (V.O.)(thick Irish accent)
                         They've never been like anyone else. 
                         From the moment they were born, of 
                         the same womb, on the same day, they 
                         just had their own way, my boys did. 
                         And I always knew that one day they 
                         would do something of true greatness. 
                         I just never expected they would 
                         bring about such a... such a 
                         reckoning.

               The MacManus brothers are fraternal twins. As Annabelle 
               MacManus speaks, Macklepenny is taken aback as he scans the 
               congregation amazed to find that he is the only one who thinks 
               this out of the ordinary.

               The monsignor begins his sermon. Macklepenny rises to stop 
               the boys from this disgraceful disturbance.

               The elder clergyman finds Macklepenny's arm, keeping him 
               seated while shaking his head. Macklepenny's confusion gives 
               way to awe as he watches the brothers step onto the altar, 
               brush by the six seated priests, and approach the enormous 
               crucifix.

               They both fall to their knees and kiss the feet of Christ. 
               They rise and as abruptly as they came, they turn and head 
               back down the aisle for the front door. They stop at the 
               rear of the church, turning to listen to the sermon.MONSIGNOR(loud, authoritative)
                         ...and I am reminded of this holy 
                         day of the sad story of Kitty 
                         Geneviese. This poor soul cried out 
                         time and time again for help but no 
                         person answered her calls. Though 
                         many saw, not one so much as called. 
                         Her assailant wiped the bloody knife 
                         off on her lifeless little body. 
                         They watched as he simply walked 
                         away. Nobody wanted to get involved. 
                         Nobody wanted to take a stand... We 
                         must fear evil men and deal with 
                         them accordingly but what we must 
                         truly guard against, what we must 
                         fear most

               The MacManuses turn and walk out the door.EXT. CHURCH STEPS  SUNNY MORNINGThe boys put on their dark glasses and pause at the top of 
               the steps to light up their cigarettes. They both roll their 
               cigarette butts along their tongues and screw them into their 
               lips. In this unique way they light up, seemingly oblivious 
               to their synchronicity and mimic.CONNOR(Irish accent)
                         I do believe the Monsignor finally 
                         got a point.MURPHY(Irish accent)

               around the corner of the entrance to the loading dock. He 
               grips a gigantic, bloody slab of meat and smirks. Connor 
               flips his cigarette out the loading dock and passes his 
               brother's hiding place. He notices the workers have stopped, 
               and are looking at him.CONNORWhat?

               Murphy slaps Connor square in the face with the bloody slab.

               Connor's face is caked with blood as he stands stunned. He 
               then leaps on Murphy, sending him into a pile of nearby 
               hamburger. He grabs a large cow tongue from a nearby heap 
               and begins slapping Murphy in the face with it as they both 
               laugh and the workers cheer.

               Their boss, McGERKIN approaches with a very large woman.

               Her head is clean-shaven. The two are still laughing, out of 
               breath, they turn.MCGERKINBoys this is Rose, Baum, Gurtle...

                         Yeah?ROZDo you know where that term comes 
                         from? In the early 1900's it was

                         long as they used a stick no wider 
                         than their thumb.

               Connor holds up his thumb and stares at it.CONNORCan't do much damage with that. 
                         Perhaps, it shoulda been the rule of

               She returns an icy stare. He hands her the knife. The co-
               workers all seem wary of Roz.

               Murphy stands on one side of Roz, Connor on the other, 
               surrounded by a tight group of workers. Everyone is within 
               ear shot of one another, cutting meat as it goes by. Knowing

               Murphy winds up and punches her square in the face. She lands

               down the alley both ways. The glowing butt falls to a filthy

               Police through a jungle of ravenous reporters, police lines 
               and uniformed officers. He is impeccably dressed in a deep 
               red suit. He is smiling, confident as he walks. He is a very 
               good-looking, slender man.

               He looks intently, for a moment, at four uniformed officers.

               They approach two dead bodies, laying next to a dented green 
               dumpster with half the paint job scraped off.

               One man, IVAN CHECKOV, lays on his stomach, closer to the 
               dumpster than the other. The ass of his pants has been burnt 
               out and a large cotton bandage is in its place.

               The other, VLADDY, has a blood soaked bandage around his 
               head and is on his stomach as well. There are hundreds of 
               pieces of porcelain of various sizes everywhere. Three plain-
               clothed homicide detectives, DUFFY, DOLLY and GREENLY hover 
               close to the bodies. Dolly and Duffy listen to GREENLY, an 
               obvious rookie, give his over-confident theory of what took 
               place.

               The chief is about to interrupt them, but Smecker holds him

               bottles of wine from a wall rack. He swings them toward each 
               other with Vladdy's head as the mid-point. The bottles 
               haphazardly connect, one on each side of his head. He crumples

               They all cheer. Ivan's face is battered as Rocco wakes and

               The Hennessey is instantly ablaze and Checkov is screaming 
               and wiggling in horror. Some just stand there stunned, but 
               most of the remaining onlookers leap to Ivan's aid. They

               They wear tattered bathrobes and boxer shorts. They put their 
               feet down into their leather boots. The boys examine the 
               extent of one another's injuries and reflect on their 
               hangovers. They both laugh and grab their heads in pain.

               Boom! The door breaks open and in hobbles Checkov and Vladdy, 
               guns drawn. Checkov is all beat up and the ass of his pants 
               is burnt out. A bulky bandage covers his buttocks. Vladdy 
               has a large bandage around his head. The boys stand in 
               surprise.

               Ivan smashes Connor in the forehead with his gun, sending 
               blood gushing down his face as he falls to the floor. Murphy 
               helplessly yells his brother's name as he is brought to his 
               knees by Vladdy. Ivan positions Connor on his knees before 
               the toilet, which is open to the room. Checkov puts his foot 
               on Connor's head and proceeds, as he struggles, to hand cuff 
               him to the old toilet. So now Connor is bleeding and hugging

               Connor, blood running from his face, listens to absolute 
               silence for just a moment. Suddenly his face reads the gravity 
               of the situation. In a split second he turns into an animal.

               pristinely on a garbage bag just behind Murphy. Ivan's look 
               turns to one of terror. Bam! He is crushed by the toilet. 
               Boom! His gun goes off, punching a hole in the dumpster near 
               the bottom. Vladdy hears the bang and crouches as he turns 
               to see a wave of tiny porcelain bits.

               Connor lands squarely on Vladdy's back. His gun discharges 
               firing a hole in the brick of the opposing wall. He is 
               savagely crushed against the ground. Connor bounces off and 
               hits the wall, landing in the garbage completely unconscious.

               Murphy takes his hands from his head. There is dead silence.

               He runs to his brother, pulls him from the trash and checks 
               his vital signs. He seems okay. Vladdy, still alive, slowly 
               crawls for his gun, inadvertently covering his own bullet 
               casing. Murphy goes over, picks up the tank cover and clubs

               resonating boom.

               Murphy quickly takes everything from the scene; guns, money, 
               wallets, watches and a pager. He shoves it in a garbage bag

               filing cabinets, lamps and chairs. Rocco clutches a brown 
               paper bag as if it is made of gold. POPPA JOE YAKAVETTA, 
               Rocco's boss, is on the phone. He is in his late forties.

               He's always comfortably dressed; sleeves rolled up, collar 
               unbuttoned.

               VINCENZO LIPAZZI swaggers across the office to Rocco. He is 
               in his late thirties. He goes out of his way to look like 
               Elvis; open shirt, gold chains and medallions. He is 
               overweight and has a bouffant hairdo, accompanied by Elvis 
               shades. Vincenzo flips a half dollar in his hand constantly.

               Rocco and Vincenzo hate each other. Yakavetta talks on the 
               phone.VINCENZO(hushed)

               Rocco obeys like an angry child. Vincenzo puts it in front 
               of Yakavetta. He sits on a filing cabinet and flips his coin. 
               Vincenzo giggles and whispers as he pokes fun at Rocco.

               The two of them resemble kids behind the teacher's back.VINCENZO(hushed)

               Vincenzo's face drops he gets up and starts walking toward 
               Rocco. Roc points at him from a seated position. He's scared.ROCCOHey, hey, hey...

               Suddenly Yakavetta jumps to a standing position. He yells.YAKAVETTAFuck you! I could snap my fingers 
                         and have you dead in four hours, 
                         rotting in a truck off of Boyleston!

               He slams the phone down. Rocco and Vincenzo are shocked but 
               try to look composed.YAKAVETTAFuckin' 90's are killin' me. I

               As he speaks he unwraps the wax paper in the bag. Rocco looks 
               over his shoulder. It's a sandwich. He's embarrassed.

               Vincenzo smirks at him.ROCCOPoppa Joe, you want me to go now?YAKAVETTAYeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.

               Rocco starts for the door. Vincenzo begins whispering in

               Vincenzo continues whispering for a few more seconds, long

                         I have a dossier on every man in

                         have opened their borders to the 
                         mafia. But the Italians, they're not 
                         convinced that the grounds in mother 
                         Russia are fertile enough for 
                         organized crime yet. So they ain't 
                         ready to commit. The Russians are 
                         coming here anyway. They are 
                         unwelcome. What we have here,

               thick naval P-coats, jeans and leather boots. They each carry 
               a mid-sized, black, duffle bag. They are serious and business-

               back wall.

               One guy says something quickly to another in Russian. The 
               other gives a one word Russian response. They boys look at 
               each other. As the elevator climbs, their eyes focus.

               The door opens. As the men exit the elevator, each face is 
               seen individually, all are victims from Smecker's crime scene.

               The elevator goes up half a floor. They hit the stop button 
               and rummage in their bags. They suit up; black gloves and 
               black masks. They strap on four 9mm. pistols with silencers, 
               in shoulder holsters, one under each arm. Connor takes a 
               large coil of black rope and drapes it around himself. He

               insult is thrown as feet kick and fists fly. They begin to 
               get tangled in their own rope. The seam of the duct breaks 
               and a tangled mess of rope and MacManuses pour out.INT.  PLAZA HOTEL  SUITE  NIGHTThey crash through the ceiling right above the fat man's 
               head. The rope gets caught and slams the boys to a halt, 
               hanging them upside down, back to back about six feet above 
               the floor. They are turning in circles. The boss is balled 
               up in the fetal position on the floor. The shocked Russians 
               say only a word or two in panic before the MacManus brothers 
               react, reaching for their guns. The Russians start to reach 
               for their guns. It's too late. The boys draw and fire as 
               they spin. Taking four shots apiece.

               There are eight dead Russians. Chests explode as they fall 
               back on the couch in a loose circle. One victims is blasted 
               over the couch.

               They notice the fat man directly beneath them. Murphy grabs 
               his Rambo knife, reaches up and cuts the rope. They land in

               a heap, scramble over to the doomed man and place him on his 
               knees. They each put a gun to the back of his head and recite 
               this prayer in perfect unison.BOTHAnd shepherds we shall be. For thee,

               With the silenced pop from their guns we cut the sound and 
               go to black and white. (Slo-mo) Choral music starts with 
               Latin script being read in the background. They take their 
               rosaries out. They slowly walk around, mumbling prayers as 
               they care for the dead. They gently turn over the bodies 
               that were on their stomachs. They brush the hair back from 
               the victims faces. They place pennies in the eyes of al the 
               corpses. When they finish their ritual, they pull off their 
               masks and look at each other. They start to grin and look 
               around. They work each other into a healthy chuckle.CONNOR(looks up)

               Just then, there's a knock at the door. They snap into action. 
               They stand at each side of the double doors, looking through 
               the peepholes. They see Rocco on the other side dressed as a 
               hotel employee. He wears a polyester shirt with gold trim 
               and a name tag that reads Jaffar. He has a good cart in front 
               of him.

               They look at each other and grin. Murphy nods. As they open 
               the door, Murphy grabs the food cart and pulls it in.

               Connor seizes the mortified Rocco and pulls him in, slamming 
               the door shut behind him. They run, dragging him and then 
               throw him in the midst of the bodies. They put their guns

               bill comes through. Connor gives it to the dancer.CONNORYou've earned this.

               The boys begin to recite their prayer. Rocco is smiling and 
               excited, he still hangs on to the now hyperventilating dancer.

               They press the button. The door goes straight up. Vincenzo

               spiders and begins to fall in spots. His chest explodes, 
               sputtering medallions and bits of gold chain inside the booth.

               The dancer faints and Rocco lays her down gently.

               The boys step down in the boot and begin their ritual.

               Rocco watches intently, intrigued. They finish and turn around

               Just then two more bills come through the slots of the other 
               two doors, which have remained closed. Murphy looks through 
               left peep hole, Connor the right. Smiles spread across their

               Murphy is aching to help but Connor is more steady. A man 
               who has been shot starts to regain consciousness. Connor 
               turns his back to shoot him (slo-mo). Murphy sees his 
               opportunity, pulls the cue ball from the table, and rolls it 
               silently across the carpet toward Rocco.

               Connor fires with his left hand and as the casing ejects 
               from the gun he catches it in mid air and makes the sign of 
               the cross. Rocco is on his back, the man is straddling him.

               They both have each others throats and are trying to strangle 
               one another. When the ball is within arms reach, Rocco slams 
               his hand down on it and knocks his assailant in the skull.

               He straddles him and begins to mercilessly beat his face in 
               with the cue ball, yelling "You sick fuck!"

               He finally stops, gets up, runs toward the boys, and throws 
               an exhausted punch at Connor who just lays Roc down on the 
               pool table and says, "Nicely done, boy". Murphy tends to 
               Roc. Connor checks out the man and seems surprised.

               Murphy takes the bloody cue ball from Rocco's hand and 
               polishes it off on his jacket, making sure Connor cannot 
               see. He replaces it perfectly on the table. Smecker now stands 
               in front of the table with the cue shining in the background.SMECKERI've never seen wounds like these

               Smecker exits to the left as Greenly enters from the right,

               Suddenly, he throws open his trench coat to reveal a special 
               leather vest beneath. Six guns, all different, are holstered 
               on the front of it: three on each side extend from just below 
               his collar bones to his abdomen. Connor and Murphy don't 
               hesitate. They each draw one of their now unsilenced guns 
               from their shoulder holsters and aim, one arm over each of

               They all start shooting at once. The noise is deafening.

               The Taurus is being pierced and the front of the house is 
               splintering as it is riddled with bullets. Smecker is still 
               in the middle, hands raised to the heavens, turning circles.

               Rocco's pinky finger gets shot off, sending blood splattering 
               against the house. He dives in the bushes reeling. He pulls 
               a gun and starts firing.

               Murphy catches a bullet in the arm and dives for the bushes 
               as well. Il Duce with lightening speed, drops the guns and 
               pulls the next two down as he walks to his right about ten 
               feet. He commences firing and the casings hit the sidewalk, 
               all different calibers and sizes are dropping down the walk.

               It's him and Connor and nobody is backing down. They both 
               grind their teeth as they fire rapidly at each other. At the 
               same moment, The Duke gets hit in the arm and Connor takes a 
               bullet in the leg. The firing ceases for a moment.

               Connor remains steady and Il Duce looks down at his arm and 
               his own blood splattered on the sidewalk.IL DUCENo!... No! No!...

               He drops the guns and pulls the last two as he moves to the

               and swearing, as Connor does the same from his position on 
               the stoop.

               The Duke turns and runs, leaving a sea of casings, and guns

               inches from Connor's face. Connor puts his thumb and

               his back to Connor.

               He stretches his neck over and bites at the collar of his p-
               coat. He gathers as much of the material in his mouth as he 
               can. He starts to yell, "Do it!" but it is muffled.

               Connor, still sobbing, begins to kick his brother's left 
               hand repeatedly. He turns it into a bloody piece of broken 
               meat as Murphy screams through the shirt. Finally, it is 

               broken enough and Murphy pulls it through the cuff.

               He stands and breaks the chair into pieces and grabs the 
               sharpest piece. Hojo enters and Murphy shoves the sharp stick 
               up through the bottom of his chin into his head. He drags 
               him around the room yelling mumbo jumbo into his face as 
               Connor jumps up and down in his chair in rage, wanting a 
               piece of the action.

               Murphy throws the man down and Connor proceeds to viciously 
               kick his dead body. The two have turned into barbarians.

               They are instantly in the throws of passion. They grope each 
               other and Smecker cleverly avoids any contact with his crotch. 
               Smecker lies down on the floor and starts to wiggle and 
               seductively touch himself. Geno stands over him, straddling 
               Smecker's hips as he undoes his pants. Suddenly, Smecker 
               grabs both of Geno's ankles and has him locked in position. 
               He repeatedly kicks Geno in the balls from his lying position 
               on the floor. The guy falls on his back unconscious. Smecker

               as he walks down the hall, striding in his high heels, wig 
               back in place. He thoughtlessly blows Chappy away as he passes 
               his position and runs down a long hallway. He turns a corner 
               and points his gun at the Mafioso cohort but pauses.

               He is already sitting with his throat cut. Smecker looks 
               puzzled as Il Duce withdraws from the shadows behind him.

               they have sat back up in the chair. They are gently placing 
               pennies in his eye and sobbing as they begin to recite the 
               prayer. As they speak, Il Duce watches. He then begins to 
               whisper the prayer right along with them. Their words match 
               up perfectly. He leans against the wall, holsters his guns, 
               and withdraws a cigarette.

               He rolls it along his tongue and twists it into his lips.

               The boys are still reciting as he strikes a match. They react 
               instantly. Still kneeling they each point a nickel-plated 45 
               toward The Duke. They turn in time to see the light from the 
               match illuminate his face. Il Duce pauses then he strides 
               into the room and proceeds to recite the last half of the 
               prayer.

               He stops between the kneeling boys and finishes off the 
               prayer. The boys are stunned as they realize this is their 
               father. He makes the sign of the cross over Rocco. Then he 
               looks down to the upturned faces of his sons. He places a 
               hand on each of their cheeks.INT.  CHEAP BOSTON HOTEL ROOM  NIGHT  3 MONTHS LATERBoth sleeping boys throw their arms out, mimicking a crucified

               The door opens a crack and Connor waves the guard into the 
               foyer and starts talking to him. Then dad zaps him with a 
               stun gun. The guard is on the floor, incapacitated and 
               drooling as the boys handcuff him.

               Connor pulls out a length of chain and drapes it through the

               just before the judge's bench. They face him toward the
