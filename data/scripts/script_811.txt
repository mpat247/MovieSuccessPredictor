NASHVILLE AIRPORT - DAYTRICYCLE MAN drives into parking lot and parks next to GREEN'S 
	old Chevy. TRICYCLE MAM: locks his machine and walks toward 
	coffee shop. GREEN gets out of his car, locks it, starts in the 
	same direction. NORMAN parks the limo, goes into main building.3	INT. AIRPORT - DAYNORMAN is attracted to large �CONNIE WHITE� display.4	INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAYAt the entrance is another "CONNIE WHITE" display and from the 
	jukebox we hear one of her songs.

	The waitress, SUELEEN, drops a fork, then gets another from an 
	overflowing sink and hands it to her customer, TRICYCLE MAN.

	There are several people at the counter with him, including 
	GREEN, who has just walked in. Another man enters, DELBERT 
	REESE. SUELEEN waits on all of them.

	A small black man comes out of the kitchen, carrying a tray full 
	or dishes. This is WADE.WADE(to SUELEEN)
			You want a ride into town?SUELEENYou bet.

	REESE looks up, checking out SUELEEN, then WADE, then the 
	TRICYCLE MAN, then his breast pocket to see it his wallet and 
	checkbook are still there, then he buries himself in his 
	newspaper.SUELEENGot me an audition tonight.WADEWell, you just remember, if you 
			can't kick front, kick back, 'cause 
			at least you're kicking... Ten 
			minutes, okay?

	She nods and talks to the TRICYCLE MAN. REESE keeps sneaking 
	looks at her.SUELEENI've just been waiting for the 
			right spot to sing in... I'm so 
			nervous...

	She laughs and starts to rinse the dishes in the sink.SUELEENI'm good, though. There ain't but 
			one Sueleen Gay -- I don't mean to 
			be conceited, but really it's true. 
			I've been taking special coaching 
			lessons from Zeke Willard -- he's 
			just wonderful. Teaches you how to 
			phrase; that's really important. 
			And breathing. Well, you know all 
			about that. Anyway, I wrote this 
			song.

	She looks down and then begins to half whisper, sing, and half do 
	all of the gestures for a song she has written as she wipes some 
	glasses. The jukebox continues to play CONNIE WHITE, and every 
	time someone walks by, Sueleen stops. She finally gets through 
	the song and discovers REESE has been watching, too. She looks 
	away from him to the TRICYCLE MAN, who smiles. Be has finished 
	his meal.SUELEENOh, listen, I really do go on. 
			Here's your check. Sure has been 
			nice talking to you.

	As she removes her apron, a HAVEN HAMILTON song comes on the 
	jukebox, "Keep on a goin'."  The TRICYCLE MAN leaves.CUT TO:5	INT. CONTROL BOOTH - NASHVILLE STUDIO - DAYWe hear the last chorus or "Keep on a goin'" as sung by HAVEN, 
	who is recording.

	He is always dressed in white. In the booth are BUD and LADY 
	PEARL. Also present are two engineers and a producer. HAVEN is 
	accompanied by a long haired piano player with a white sweater. 
	HAVEN is not too happy with him.6	ANOTHER ANGLEOPAL enters the booth, carrying a too-large English tape 
	recorder. HAVEN Stops singing, mad at OPAL'S interruption and 
	the piano player. Through the glass we see him pantomiming 
	instructions for her to leave. As she does, HAVEN starts over.7	INT. HALLWAY - DAYOPAL wanders to the next studio. BUD follows, apologizing.BUDSorry. He sees a tape recorder and 
			gets upset.

	She looks at him.BUDHe's my father.OPALHaven Hamilton is your father? Can 
			you arrange an interview?8	INT. SECOND RECORDING BOOTH - DAYThey have entered a different control tooth. In the recording 
	portion, LINNEA and an all-black, male CHOIR sings a gospel song. 
	OPAL asks BUD who this group is.9	INT. FIRST CONTROL BOOTH - DAYBUD returns. HAVEN has just exploded at the piano player and 
	starts to leave, yelling at the producer.HAVENWho the hell is playing piano? Get 
			that hippie out of here... He's got 
			a tin ear. I asked for Pig, dammit. 
			I'm moving on 'cause I gotta get to 
			the airport. When you get my 
			backups straight, then we'll talk 
			about cutting this tune here.

	He heads for the hallway.10	INT. HALLWAY - DAYIt is jammed with black singers from the CHOIR. HAVEN hates 
	being crushed and moves through the congestion like a white 
	knight. OPAL moves near.OPALExcuse me, sir. I'm here putting 
			together a film. I would like to 
			ask some questions.

	She has to fumble with the bulky tape machine and transformer.HAVENForeigner?OPALI'm from BBC television.HAVENWhere the hell is that?

	HAVEN nod a politely and leaves the crowded hallway with BUD and 
	PEARL. He spots LINNEA.HAVENLinnea.LINNEAHow you doing, Haven?HAVENoh, fine. Couldn't be better.11	ANGLE T0WARD OUTSIDEThey all say goodbye and HAVEN'S group gets into a new white jeepCUT TO:12	EXT.

	GREEN sees his niece and walks over.GREENJoan?

	She turns.L.A. JOANDid you see who that was?GREENGlad to see you. Ester'll be glad, 
			too.L.A. JOANHe is just wonderful.GREENI'1l get your bag.CUT TO:15	EXT. LANDING AREA - AIRPORT - DAYGLENN has just deposited a postcard in a mailbox and approaches a 
	gathering cluster of people. NORMAN and TRICYCLE MAN are nearby. 
	Everybody is waiting for BARBARA JEAN to appear. GLENN steps 
	close to NORMAN.GLENNAm I late?NORMANLate!  Oh, Jesus!

	He runs off.16	ANOTHER ANGLEAs NORMAN runs toward passenger loading, we see HAVEN'S jeep 
	arrive with HAVEN, BUD and PEARL. It parks and all climb out. 
	REESE and TRIPLETTE approach the 'Barbara Jean' plane. BARNETT 
	is already on the runway, making arrangements. HAVEN'S group all 
	shake hands.HAVENDelbert, how are you?REESEI'm fine. This here is John 
			Triplette. Triplette, like you to 
			meet the Honorary Mayor, Haven 
			Hamilton.HAVENGood to meet you.
				 (turns to BUD)
			Bud, have them move the horses.TRIPLETTEPleasureREESEWhere is she?HAVENStill inside the plane posing for 
			pictures and signing autographs. 
			She's got a new album cut again. 
			She'll be down in a minute. But 
			she'll be late for the Opera if she 
			doesn't hurry. Bud, get the plane on 
			the walkie-talkie.

	BUD fumbles on his walkie-talkie telephone, but can't seem to get 
	anything.BUDThey don't seem to be answering. 
			The ambulance boys are here, though. 
			Barnett always expects them to get 
			there like a shot. That thing only 
			goes a hundred fall bore with the 
			sirens going.HAVENThank you, Bud.

	BUD nods like he has been complimented.17	ANGLE TOWARD PLANEA wave of noise begins from the fans. The band and majorettes 
	and horses and ropers go into a rendition of one of her hit tunes 
	as BARBARA JEAN appears. Everyone is breaking their neck to see, 
	especially GLENN. HAVEN and REESE give her the first round of 
	applause, then go back to talking. TRIPLETTE has never been 
	exposed to anything quite like this before and stands a little in 
	awe of the situation.

	When the twirling and tricking and music stop, BARBARA JEAN 
	descends the stairs.HAVENBud, tell them to move the horses. 
			Promised this strip would be spic 
			and span.

	He smiles and winks.REESEListen, we'll go get the car and 
			come back. This'l1 be going on for 
			a while.HAVENYou bet. She's probably talking to 
			somebody about their sick child. You 
			know how she is.

	They wave goodbye and head in the direction of the loading zone. 
	Behind them, the horse people disperse and get into their cars 
	and horse trailers, preparing to return to Nashville.18	ANOTHER ANGLEBARNETT comes over to REESE, TRIPLETTE, HAVEN, BUD and PEARL 
	while BARBARA JEAN continues to greet fans.19	EXT. AIRPORT NEAR PARKING LOT - DAYWhile the BARBARA JEAN arrival takes place on the runway NORMAN 
	finds BILL and MARY. NORMAN speaks softly and out of breath, 
	trying to pretend he's on time.NORMANHi.

	BILL slaps him on the back and engulfs him.BILLHi, Norman.

	NORMAN looks relieved. BILL and MARY have been arguing.NORMANSure is nice to see you all again. 
			I never thought I'd see you again 
			after the last time.BILLOh, Norman, you worry too much.

	MARY takes NORMAN'S hand.MARYNorman, how are you?

	She kisses him and he blushes. BILL and MARY are glad to talk to 
	someone else.NORMANFine. Just fine.

	As they walk to the limo, we see a car with loudspeakers on top 
	of it and clearly written door signs that read: "Replacement 
	Party" in red, white and blue. REESE and TILIPLETTE are walking 
	toward it, shaking hands with several people.NORMANSure have missed you all, though. 
			Oh, where's Tom?  Isn't he with you?BILLDon't worry about old Tom.20	ANOTHER ANGLETOM and the stews walk to a VW with a sun roof.

	Nearby REESE and TRIPLETTE get into their Cadillac, behind it the 
	Replacement Party car. Coming from the loudspeakers a tape-
	recorded VOICE:VOICEHave you thought about your future 
			and what America needs to examine...

	Behind the Replacement Party car is an airport bus with "Connie 
	White" posters on the side. GLENN is one or the passengers. He 
	cranes his neck to continue watching the runway and BARBARA JEAN.21	EXT. PARKING LOTNORMAN'S limo, with BILL and MARY, follows traffic as the 
	TRICYCLE MAN fires up his machine. WADE'S car with SUELEEN also 
	joins the procession.22	ANGLE TOWARD RUNWAYThe orange ambulance has moved into the area near the plane and 
	there seems to be a great deal at activity.

	REESE and TRIPLETTE'S car stops, and they rush out and run into 
	HAVEN, who is shouting for people to get the hell out of the way.23	NEW ANGLETwo ambulance ATTENDANTS cut through the crowd. HAVEN, TRIPLETTE 
	and REESE rush near. BARNETT is on his knees over BARBARA JEAN, 
	who has collapsed. The ATTENDANTS lean over her with ammonia. 
	They test her reflexes, etc..ATTENDANTHow long was she out?BARNETTNot too long. But she keeps 
			passing out.

	She comes to and looks at them all.BARBARA JEAN(oblivious)
			Just give your manna that vitamin 
			E. Makes a world of difference.HAVENHere she is again.

	She resists the ammonia, looks around and passes out again.ATTENDANTOkay, let's get her to the wagon.

	A stretcher is brought in and she is placed under oxygen. BARNETT 
	climbs into the ambulance with BARBARA JEAN, slamming the door on 
	DELBERT and TRIPLETTE. HAVEN stands there, yelling at people. 
	DELBERT and TRIPLETTE rush back to their car as the ambulance 
	speeds off, siren wailing.CUT TO:24	EXT. FREEVAY TO NASHVILLE - DAY25	TRICYCLE MANleads the procession.26	INT. GREEN'S CARGREENEater's been asking for you.

	L.A. JOAN is trying to find a station she likes on her transistor 
	radio.L.A. JOANUh huh.GREENShe's been in the hospital two 
			weeks yesterday.

	L.A. JOAN can't find anything she likes.L.A. JOANYou know anything about the 
			stations here?GREEN(hasn't heard) 
			It's hard to say. Doctors thought

			Ford truck had cut off his foot. 
			The other one said that wasn't true.

			oil changed?BUDYa... where do you want me to take 
			it?PEARLDo you remember Eddie Black? He had

	She laughs.SUELEENNo -- That's exercises. My coach 
			says you have to do exercise because 
			the vocal chords are muscle and need 
			to be stretched. Every time you 
			stretch them, the middle part sets 
			stronger. That's the place where I 
			sing.WADEYou think I got any kind of a

	He breaks into a scale.SUELEENYou sure do it loud.WADEIs that good?SUELEENIt's not bad.WADEYou think I should take lessons?SUELEENIf you're serious. Being serious

	He turns to the visitors.BARNETTDoctor says you'll have to go on 
			out now

	There are tones of disappointment, most of them are very involved 
	in their own conversations. TRIPLETTE walks toward the bed, but 
	can't really get close enough. He finally captures BARNETT as 
	the people start to leave.TRIPLETTEExcuse me, Barnett, how's she

	BARNETT turns and studies him for a moment as though he remembers 
	who he is. He doesn't.TRIPLETTEI'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. 
			I'm John Triplette... a friend of

			to be replaced, and, besides, I just

			Foxy who's been writing to me for 
			years is going to be there from 
			Michigan.DOCTORYou cannot leave this bed until I
