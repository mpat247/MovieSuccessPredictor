slowly heads down the residential street, cruises past
the Bronco in the driveway, and slows to a stop. The
music stops and TWO BLACK MEN spring from the car.

They move with purpose. The larger figure, crowbar in
hand, moves to the truck. The GUN wielding passenger
hurries to the front door and stands guard. Inside the
car, another man methodically waits.INT. BEDROOM - DANNY VINYARD'S EYESThe sex happening in the next room makes it difficult for
Danny to sleep. Next to a digital clock that reads
3:07AM, the clean cut 14-year-old flips to his side.

A poster of Lee Ving of FEAR onstage, taped to the wall.
Pre-Calculus and Biology books on the floor. Cassettes
scattered on his tiny desk. A stereo in the corner.

tome-filled bookshelf. The moans, meanwhile, approach
orgasm.

TIGHT ON DEREK VINYARD. The young man has a shaved head,
a thick goatee, and a well-crafted SWASTIKA on his left
tit. On top of Derek in the bed is his barely-of-age
girlfriend, STACEY. The covers are completely off and a
BLACK ROSE is tattooed across her right shoulder blade.
Danny watches her fuck, only for a second.DANNY(softly)

Der !

Danny walks over and shakes him. Startled, Derek
forcefully grabs his little brother's arm.DEREK(controlled)

Stacey stops and looks over.  Frustated, she rolls off
Derek and onto her side.STACEYFucking pervert, Dan!DANNYThere's a black guy outside Der...
breaking into your car.

Derek, muscled and tattooed, jumps out of the bed and
quickly puts on his skivvies. He reaches under his
mattress, pulls out a SIG .45 semi-automatic pistol, and
shoves in a clip.DEREKHow long has he been out there?DANNYNot long.STACEYWho?DEREKNobody. Relax.

Stacey sits up quickly from the bed as Derek pulls on his
black combat boots.STACEYWho's out there, Derek?DEREKNot right now, honey.

He looks at his girlfriend and walks off.INT. HALLWAY - SAMETIGHT ON DEREK. He walks down the hall. The intensity
on his face is alarming. He stops at the front door and
grabs the doorknob. Before he turns the knob, he peeks
through the eye hole on the door.EXT. HOUSE - DEREK'S EYE POVTHE BLACK GUARD carelessly turns toward the driveway to
see what's taking his partner so long with the wires.INT. HOUSE - DEREK AT THE DOORThe guard has his back to him. Derek goes.EXT. HOUSE - THE DUELDerek throws open the door and the black man standing

a distance.STACEY (O.S.)Get down, Danny! Jesus!

his bedroom window. Derek cocks his piece, points it and
walks toward the man.

TIGHT ON DEREK'S FACE. Eyes blistering.FADE TO BLACK:THREE YEARS LATEREXT. POLICE STATION - EARLY MORNINGA black man in a suit and tie, ROBERT SWEENEY, goes
through the automatic doors and into the station. He
approaches a DESK SERGEANT. A daily calendar on her desk
reads MONDAY. MARCH 3. 1997.SWEENEYCaptain Rasmussen?DESK SERGEANTBriefing room. Down that hall...third
door on the left.INT. BRIEFING ROOM - A MEETINGCops and detectives sit attentively and a few sip coffee.
The clock on the wall above reads 7:38 AM. Middle-aged
with slicked-back hair, CAPTAIN JOHN RASMUSSEN finishes a
thought. He spots Sweeney as he enters and aimlessly
reaches for a file.RASMUSSENAll right. Moving on--
(acknowledging)
Good Morning, Doctor.

The group looks over and meets Sweeney's hard glare.SWEENEYGood morning.RASMUSSENGentlemen, this is Dr. Bob Sweeney.
He's Principal over at Venice High and
for some time now he's done a load of
outreach work with gangs...in and out
of the can.

Sweeney nods as Rasmussen cough.  He sips water and
continues.RASMUSSENThree years ago a local kid named
Derek Vinyard gets sent up for
murdering a couple of Crips who were
trying to jack his car. Bob taught
Vinyard back in high school and has
followed the case closely.YOUNG COPHe was a skinhead, right?SWEENEYDerek was more like...the skinhead.
He and Cameron Alexander.COP #2Who?

Rasmussen opens a FILE in front of him. There rests
Derek's mug shot. He flips it over and reveals
CAMMERON'S MUG SHOT. Front and side view.RASMUSSENCammeron Alexander is probably the
biggest writer and distributor of
white power literature in LA County.
He promotes white power bands, writes
reviews, columns, all at the ripe age
of forty.YOUNG COP(smiling)
He's forty? Jesus.RASMUSSENPretty clean record...runs everything
out of his house down by the beach.SWEENEYThere weren't any organized white
gangs around Venice before those two
hooked up. Very few, if any. It was
mostly just black and Mexican. But it
was tiny. They hit it off though...
and Alexander hit the jackpot with
Derek.

Rasmussen reaches over and pushes play on a VCR.RASMUSSENWe got some uncut footage here.
Courtesy of NBC.ON THE TELEVISION--REPORTEREarlier this evening...LA County
Firefighter Dennis Vinyard was shot
and killed while putting out a fire in
a suspected Compton drug den.RASMUSSEN(to the group)
This being February of '90.EXT. VINYARD HOUSEHOLD - A LIVE BROADCAST - VIDEOTAPEA YOUNGER DEREK, short haired with no tattoos, stands
next to the reporter. Derek wears a Venice High
Basketball jersey drenched in sweat. Towel around neck,
he thinks to himself as the man speaks into the camera.REPORTERTo my right I have Lieutenant
Vinyard's oldest son Derek.
     (to Derek)
How do you feel about all this, son?DEREKHow do I feel? How do you think I
feel? It's typical.REPORTERTypical how, Derek?DEREKWell...look at our country. It's a
haven for criminals. Black...brown...
yellow...whatever.REPORTERSo you're saying the murder of your
father is "race" related?DEREKEvery problem in this country is
"race" related. Every problem, not
just crime. These problems are rooted
in the black community, the Hispanic
community, the Asian...every non-
Protestant group in our society.
     (then)
Look at the shit. Immigration...
welfare...AIDS...they're all the
problems of the non-white. Look at
the statistics.REPORTERMost of these issues you're referring
to though son are related to--DEREK(interrupting)
No no no! Don't say poverty right now
cause that's not it. They're not a
product of our fucking environment
either! Minorities don't give two
shits about this country! They're
here to exploit...not embrace.RASMUSSEN (O.S)(over reporter's question)
When Alexander got his hands on this
segment...he copied it, sent it out
and it became the Gettysberg Address
for hate groups across the country.BACK TO THE TELEVISION.DEREKMillions of white Europeans came to
this country and flourished within a
generation! A generation! So what
the fuck is wrong with these people?!REPORTERWhat does any of this have to do with
your father?DEREKBecause my father was doing his
fucking job! Saving a nigger
neighborhood he didn't give two shits
about! And he got killed by some drug
dealer who still collects a fucking
welfare check.

Derek looks at the man and walks over to HIS MOTHER
DORIS, who smokes a cigarette. The camera follows him as
he puts his arm around her and escorts her back inside
their Venice Beach residence. The camera pans back to
the reporter who just stands there, speechless.INT. BRIEFING ROOM - SAMERasmussen ejects the tape, the screen turns to fuzz, and
he turns it off.RASMUSSENVinyard was quietly released from
Chino on Saturday after three and some
odd years. And I think it's something
we might want to keep an eye on for a
few days.SWEENEYI don't wanna be an alarmist. But
payback is out there. I know it is.
And in this particular case...if
Vinyard gets popped...more people will
get popped.RASMUSSENIt's not exactly LAPD policy but I
want 24-hour surveillance on Vinyard
for a few days.COP #2(smiling in disbelief)
Twenty-four hour surveillance, sir?RASMUSSENJust for a few days.ANOTHER COPHe doesn't sound like Mr. Lovely here,
Captain. You want us to bust him or
protect him?

Rasmussen offers Sweeney a look that it's his question.SWEENEYI don't think Vinyard's gonna be the
one to start anything. It's his
following.RASMUSSENEither way...let's keep it low.CUT TO:EXT. VENICE BEACH BOARDWALK - MORNINGPEACEFUL DAY by PENNYWISE blasts from Danny's walkman
headphones. The day is cloudy and overcast but that
doesn't bother the local SURFERS. A twosome paddles
north to get a better break on the next set. Danny
watches as he skateboards down the strand.

His appearance is changed, now resembling a younger,
softer Derek.

Head shaved to a quarter of an inch, he wears a PLAIN
WHITE BACKPACK with punk/white power bands scribbled all
over it. Your standard Sex Pistols, DK, Germs, G.B.M.,
and Adolescents in black. Cro-Magnons and Skrewdriver
off to the left. In red is the largest name, DICK NIXON.CUT TO:EXT. VENICE HIGH SCHOOL - THE BIKE CORRALKids from all walks of life park their cars, lock their
 bikes and head off to class.EXT. HALLWAY - TIGHT ON A THRASHED LOCKERDanny throws his SKATEBOARD in, slams the door, and turns
 to face LIZZY, a pretty, redheaded freshman.LIZZYHi Danny.DANNYHey Lizzy.

The two smile at one another as the FIRST BELL RINGS.CUT TO:INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM - A URINALDanny takes a piss. Outside, a voice pleads "It wasn't
me!" DARYL DAWSON, pale and thin, is shoved into the
bathroom and he trips into the sink. LITTLE HENRY, a
young black kid, enters with two of his buddies. Danny
zips up and faces them.LITTLE HENRY(to a terrified Daryl)
                 Tellin' Baker I'm fuckin' cheatin'?
                 I've never cheated in my life.BUDDY #1Beat his ass, Henry!LITTLE HENRYWhy you trippin' on me?DARYLI didn't say anything, Henry. I
                 swear.BUDDY #2He's lying, man! I was right there!

Little Henry cracks Daryl in the face and practically
knocks him down with one shot. A bleeding Daryl
struggles to his hands and knees behind Danny.LITTLE HENRYNext time, man.

Danny stares into Henry's eyes and the trio exits. Dannv
helps Daryl back up to the sink. THE SECOND BELL RINGS.CUT TO:INT. CLASS - SAMEKids have just settled into their seats.  Danny walks in 
and tries to be discrete.OFFSCREEN VOICEVinyard!?

An OLDER TEACHER writes an Algebra problem on the board
for the students to solve.OLDER TEACHERYou're late.

The man grabs a pink slip off his desk and hands it to
Danny.OLD TEACHERBut it looks like you got bigger
problems.DANNY(reading the slip)
Oh, man! Come on. Get a job.

The teacher stares at him.CUT TO:INT. PRINCIPAL LOBBY - DANNYHe sits in a chair next to an office door marked DR.
ROBERT SWEENEY - PRINCIPAL. Danny glances at the
secretary as she types and talks on the phone.

TIGHT ON DANNY. He listens to the conversation through
the the crack in the door as his eyes swell.MURRAY (O.S.)I do not have a problem with him as an
individual, alright!?SWEENEY (O.S.)Oh shit Murray sure you do.  You hate
this kid.INT. OFFICE - THE CONVERSATIONThe bespectacled, short-haired MURRAY ROSENBERG, 48,
looks over and spots Danny listening outside. Murray
walks over and shuts the door. He looks at DR. SWEENEY,
who now has his jacket off.

He points to a typewritten report on the desk and smiles
in horror. It is titled BOOK REPORT--MEIN KAMPF.
"Daniel Vinvard - American History" is in the upper left
hand corner.MURRAYThis paper is a travesty, Bob!
Arguing for Hitler as a civil rights
hero?! You've gotta draw a line.SWEENEYMurray...it says in your syllabus that
they could do their report on any book
related to the struggle for Civil
Rights.MURRAYOh come on, Bob!SWEENEYLet me finish! He needs help...I'm
not disputing that. But I read it and
I'm not going to throw him out.MURRAYHis brother probably put him up to it.SWEENEYI can guarantee you his brother didn't
have anything to do with it, Murray.

Murray sighs and takes off his glasses.MURRAYDon't let him walk scot-free here.
For his sake...not mine. You might be
all he has left.

Sweeney stares at the younger teacher and nods.CUT TO:EXT. OFFICE - THE DOOR OPENSMurray walks out and turns back to Sweeney.MURRAYThanks, Bob.SWEENEY (O.S.)Okay. Get in here, Dan!

Danny and Murray make hostile eye contact.DANNYI knew it was you.SWEENEY (O.S.)Shut up and get your ass in here!INT. OFFICE - DANNY ENTERSBefore he even gets through the door he's chastised.SWEENEYWhat's it gonna be, Dan?DANNYWhat's what going to be?SWEENEYThis petty shit you're pullin'.DANNYWell...I don't know.SWEENEYYou said it, all right. Sit down.

Danny does what he's told. Sweeney stares at the
teenager and leans back in his chair.SWEENEYAre you okay?DANNYYeah.SWEENEYAny time you wanna talk, Dan--DANNYOkay.SWEENEYHow's Derek?DANNYFine.SWEENEYAdjusting okay?DANNYYeah.SWEENEYHe was a student of mine. Honors
English. He was a great student...
like you...but he hung out with
scumbags. Also like you. That's why
he ended up in the pen, hunh?

No answer. Sweeney holds up Danny's paper.SWEENEYGreat writing. I can't correct it
though. It wreaks too much of shit.DANNYCome on, man! I followed directions
and wrote an "A" paper. It's got
nothing to do with Derek.SWEENEYEverything you do now has something to
do with Derek. Who told you to do
this?DANNYLet us get on with our lives, man!SWEENEYHey, I'm not worried about Derek--he
can take care of himself.  I'm worried
about his little brother.
(softly)
Mein Kampf, Dan? I should expel you!DANNYDo it. What?  You don't think I could
handle it?SWEENEY(smiling in disbelief)
The street would kill you, Danny.
You're not tough. The second a
brother pulls a gun on your ass you'll
be holierin' for Doris.
     (pondering to himself)
So here's the drill. Take it or leave

your history teacher from here on out.
We're gonna deal with shit happening
right now. Call it American
History...X. I see your ass once a
day. Any more, any less, and you're a
memory at Venice High. Clear?DANNYIt took me a week to read Mein Kampf.
Come on, Sweeney.SWEENEYMy name is Dr. Sweeney. And I want a
another paper on my desk tomorrow.DANNYWhat am I doing it on then?SWEENEYIt'S not a "what", it's a "who."
         (after a beat)
Derek.SMASH TO:EXT. VENICE SHORELINE - LATE AFTERNOONA series of intercuts shows activity in and around the
pier. A HOMELESS LATINO MAN searches a trash dumpster.
OPEN VENDORS sell tie-dye and water bong paraphernalia.
A FAT WOMAN walks past eating a hot dog. BLACK GANG
MEMBERS play basketball in their low-rider shorts and
boxers.

TIGHT ON DANNY. He skateboards down the boardwalk,
performing tricks and spinning the board. He eats shit,
recovers, and looks off into the distance.DANNY (V/O)People look at me...and they see my
brother. That's how things have gone
since the murder of our father.EXT. BOARDWALK - NEAR THE BASKETBALL COURTFrom afar, he spots a group of black gang members shoot
hoops. He and Little Henry from earlier exchange a cold
glance.DANNY (V/O)Little Henry Hastings and his older
brother Jerome. Jerome's a Shoreline
Crip...Henry's on his way.

Little Henry and older brother JEROME catch their breath
and stare down Dan. Danny doesn't flinch. Jerome sips
from a 40 oz. beer and resumes playing.DANNY (V/O)Venice Beach, man. It didn't always
look like this. I mean...our Dad used
to take us down here to run...and it
was cool. Derek fucking owned this
place.        Since then though...the gangs,
man--

TIGHT ON DANNy. He watches the basketball action as he
takes a drag off his Marlboro Red.DANNY (V/O)--they've moved west from Inglewood
and South Central and have really
just...taken over. Especially at my
high school. The Venice Locos are big
too but they hang out in bumluck Mar
Vista. It's scary.
     (then)
And then there's The Disciples of
Christ. The D.O.C.

Jerome and Little Henry joke and argue with eight extra
players and spectators.DISSOLVE TO:EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - A GAME - FLASHBACKDANNY'S POV. The teams are a mixed assemblage of 3
blacks and 2 Latinos and 3 whites and 1 black and 1
Latino. SKINHEAD FAT SETH RYAN, early twenties, and his
two skinhead buddies, can't compete against the better,
predominantly black team. One of the skins, CURTIS, has
a shaved head, a light beard and an M-16 RIFLE tattooed
on his head.

JEROME and LITTLE HENRY sit together to the right of the
court and monitor closely. Danny looks over his left
shoulder and sees Derek and Stacey sit with CAMMERON.
Cowboy hat and BRONCO JERSEY, they sit and converse on
the bleachers.LAWRENCESeven-six. Let's go!  Set some picks!SETHBring it on, boy.

Derek quickly moves his eyes to the court.LAWRENCEBoy?

Lawrence quickly pivots past Seth, dunks it, and yells as
he hangs on the rim. The crowd cheers.SETHLucky piece of shit! I'm through
"monkeying" around with your ass!

Lawrence spins around and challenges Seth.LAWRENCEFat, pasty, pale, pastrami eating,
cracker, motherfucker. A hundred
bucks says I make you my bitch.SETH(to the crowd)
Here we go! Trying to make ends meet
for that cut in welfare.

He makes a scene and passes Danny on the sideline.
Lawrence waits for Seth to take it further. Danny looks
at him, concerned.DANNYIt's eight-six, Seth.SETHWhen I want your fucking opinion I'll
ask for it, fuckhead.
     (to Derek and Cam)
Help me cover here, guys.

Derek and Cameron stare at Seth, knowing Seth will lose
and embarrass them.CAMMERONYou got a big fucking mouth, fat kid.SETHI'll take this negro down.DEREKYou can't take a shit, Seth.  Shut up.

Derek shoots a look to Cameron, comes to a decision, and
stands. He shouts for all to hear.DEREKI got a bet.

Lawrence stares at him, sensing something harder.DEREKI come in, same score now, first one
to eleven. Black boys against the
white boys.

Lawrence looks back to his boys in disbelief.LAWRENCEName your price, Cracker.DEREKNo money...for the court. We win, you
grab your shit and find a different
place to run. Not just today...
forever. You win, and we don't come
back. No hitching, no fighting, here
in front of everyone. Six-eight, our
ball.

The action around the court gets very still.  Finally,
Lawrence nods.LAWRENCEYou got a lot of fucking balls, man.
Bring it. Right now.

Derek pulls off his sweatshirt and gives it to Stacey.
Lawrence gets his team together.CUT TO:EXT. COURT - BLACK VERSUS WHITENo more mixed assemblage of players.  One team is white, 
one team is black.A SERIES OF SMOTSDerek blows by Lawrence for a left handed layup. Derek
hits a thirty looter. Curtis grabs a rebound and uses
his elbows to get defenders off him. Big Lawrence fouls
Derek hard and Derek stares at him. Big Lawrence makes a
twenty foot turnaround. Lawrence advances on a three on
two and dunks it. Derek pump fakes three times and uses
the glass for a deuce. Finally, Derek drives the lane
and dishes to Seth at the last minute for a bucket.SETHYes! Ten a piece! Nice fucking dish.SETH and CURTIS slap Derek's hand as they get back on
transition. Derek stares at Lawrence. CAMMERON watches
intently.CAMMERONIt's all you, Der!LAWRENCEFuckin' BYU, man!  All right!  All we
need is one now!

Lawrence and Derek lock eyes, a look exceeding
competitive boundary. A look filled with rage.CAMMERONUse that fat ass and keep him out,
Seth!

Seth and the opposing player bang to get position
underneath.LAWRENCEI ain't losin' in my house!  Clear it 
out!

The POWER FORWARD dribbles beautifully up the court --
his teammates clearing out the key. Defensively, Derek
is solid. He tries to pass Derek but Derek's defense is
stifling. Again. With another tricky move, Lawrence
inadvertently puts his LEFT ELBOW into Derek's face,
sending him quickly to the pavement. EVERYBODY STOPS.CURTISThat's fuckin' offense!LAWRENCEGet the fuck outta here!  He was
movin' his feet!

Derek, teeth bloodied, rises. The two have a stare down.DEREK(threateningly)
I'll go if you want to.LAWRENCEYou wanna piece! Bring it!

Players quickly rush to restrain the two even though the
teams hate each other.DEREKIf you wanna go...I'm ready.  Don't be
throwin' fuckin' elbows.LAWRENCEFuck you!

Derek walks over to Cammeron, Danny and Stacey standing
courtside. She has a water bottle and a towel waiting
for him. He wipes his BLOODY LIP and takes a sip.
Cameron stares at Derek.CAMMERONHey.  Are you copacetic?

Derek nods and looks at Danny and Stacey.CAMMERONHe's gonna do that 180 spin move.DEREKI know what he's gonna do.DANNYYou gotta call offense on that shit.DEREKNot on point game you don't.STACEYFuck that, D. That chucker can't pull
that shit. It's fucking-DEREKNot on point, honey.

He turns back to the court and walks over to Lawrence.
He stands in front of him and checks the ball in.DEREKTens!

Lawrence takes the ball, passes it to the wing, and
quickly gets it back. Lawrence dribbles up top, makes a
marvelous 180 spin with the ball, and pulls up for a ten
foot jumper. Derek reads it perfectly and REJECTS IT.
Lawrence trips to the ground, Derek grabs the ball off
the fast break and DUNKS IT.DANNY(amazed by the dunk)
Holy shit!

Everybody courtside goes nuts. Derek walks to the
sideline, ignoring all the hand slaps being offered.
Everyone is riveted on Derek.SETH(to the other team)
Get off my  fucking court!  This is my
house!DANNYYeah! Fuck...yeah!

A sweaty Derek pulls his little brother close. He takes
a drink of water, spits out more blood, looks at his
bitter opponent, and says nothing.CUT TO:EXT. STREET - BY THE COURTDerek, Danny, Seth, Cammeron, Curtis and Stacey stand
outside the Bronco. The doors are all open and the
stereo softly plays music in the b.g. Derek dries off.

DANNY'S POV. Derek throws a shirt and tie over his
sweaty, tattooed body. Danny watches the tats disappear,
and it's almost like his brother is normal. A name tag
reads LA COPY CENTER - DEREK - ASSISTANT MANAGER.

Derek looks at JEROME and LAWRENCE from afar. Danny
notices the two men stare at his brother, ready to kill.
Derek meets their gaze.CUT TO:EXT. VENICE BOARDWALK - PRESENT - DANNY'S POVDanny awakens from his daydream. The black players now

fullsuits hang down.DANNY (O.S)There's dick for waves.CHRISI don't care. I just wanna get wet.

Derek stares at Seth, ready to beat the fuck out of him.
Suddenly, Doris starts in with a COUGHING ATTACK. Derek                                      
quickly fills a glass of water and goes in there.INT. LIVING ROOM - THE PINK BLANKETShe coughs incessantly. Derek sits down beside her,

stare at her in the background.DORISJust put me out of my mercy.DEREKYou'll be okay. You want me to pick
you up any more medicine?

checks out the couch.DEREKJesus. I can't believe I ever let it

Danny looks at Derek and smiles.DANNYWhatever, dude. I'm gonna go power

He pats his brother on the shoulder and walks off.DEREKNot at Cammeron's you won't see me.DANNY(turning back)
Come on, Der! It's gonna be fuckin'--DEREKForget it, Danny! It ain't gonna
          happen for you tonight.

Danny walks off, frustrated. He crosses Seth's path,
gets shoved into the wall, and reacts like it's an
everyday occurrence. Seth moves out the side window and
climbs out.SETHHurry up. I'm starving.DAVINAWhat else is new?

Derek nods, looks at his mother and kisses her on the
forehead.DEREKI'll see ya.DORISOkay. Be careful.DEREKI will.

Davina walks to the door and looks back to her brother.DAVINAWhat's the matter with you? You wanna
be a fuckin' loser your whole life?

Not receiving a response, she walks out the door.DANNYAsshole Sweeney.

He slowly begins to strike the computer keys. The screen
reads "People look at me and they see my brother. That's
the way things have gone since the murder of our father,"

DANNY'S POV. Danny looks to his left and sees Derek with
Cammeron, who sits in the driver's seat of the BRONCO.
Stacey leans in from the backseat.STACEYI hope you kill that fucker.

Derek looks back at her and straight to Cameron.CAMMERONHe might have a gun.DEREKAre you going in or not?CAMMERONYou know I got the cops on me. If I
come up on one of those cameras I'm a
dead man.

She nods and Derek gets out. The group is silent.DEREKCome on. Let's pull it together.
Hey! We're not playing fuckin' games
here. Let's go.

The group snaps to attention behind him as Seth toys with
the camera. CURTIS from earlier takes a hit off a joint
and makes Derek wait for him. Derek walks over to the
crazy man, takes the joint, and throws it onto the
ground.DEREKWhat the fuck, Curtis? You a fuckin'
nigger now? Want some crack?CURTISNo.DEREK(grabbing his neck)
Pull your fucking stupid head out of
your ass then.CURTISOkay. Jesus.DEREK(to the group)

immigration problems spiralling out of

taking over our land with their
fucking Yen. Mexicans...flocking into
this place like some giant fucking
Pinata was shattered.

The group busts up. Cammeron watches Derek and smiles.DEREKDon't laugh. It's tragic. On the
Statue of Liberty it says "Give me
your tired, your hungry, your poor,
your huddled masses...yearning to be
free." It does not say give me your
shiftless, your greedy, your indolent,
your criminals, looking for a free
ticket.

The group agrees.DEREKWe're here tonight to show the
government how we feel about
minorities taking over our country.

As the camera swings into line, TRACKING WITH THEM, Derek
reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a STOCKING
MASK. He pulls it down over his face.

The foot soldiers follow him in unison.DEREK(back to his troops)
Remember. No names. Danny?  Stay
right on my fucking ass, man.

And now they're getting ahead of us. As the CAMERA
SWINGS behind them, we see their destination.EXT. LIGHTED GROCERY STORE - SAMEThey storm the front entrance. The few people who are in
there scream and scramble for cover. Derek grabs a
Mexican boxboy and throws him to the ground. Seth
catches up to another and gets him on the ground.SETHWheto's your fucking green card,
asshole?

Seth kicks the young man in the face with a blatant shot
and continues. DEREK leaves a terrified white woman
alone like she's not even there and pushes over an
adjacent shelf, knocking over another worker with CANS OFBEANS.DEREK(referring to the border)
Can't hide from me, motherfucker!

He kicks the man and looks around the market for more.
Danny watches in awe. Curtis breaks a giant jelly jar
over a head. Another skin throws a BLACK CHECKER into a
shelf of POTATO CHIPS.

loosened tie, LA COPY CENTER name tag from earlier. His
charisma draws their attention as he rambles over the
crackling rainfall.DANNY (V/O)Everyone but Derek.DEREKFuck you, Murray. White men don't
cruise the streets of LA killing each
other.MURRAYNo.  You guys make bombs.

Derek stares at the man, eyes filled with homicide.DEREKYou're so fucking lame. A couple of
cranks in cabins in Montana is not
statistically significant.

Three different times Rodney King
comes at those officers with the
intent to hurt them. To hurt them!
Three times! But since we see it on
some fucking tampered videotape...the
bleeding heart media makes you believe

we see is Powell, Koon and Wind
hittin' him and--
     (busting up laughing)
Briseno kickin' him in the back of the
fuckin' skull with his boot. Still,
the dumbfuck's tryin' to get up and
kick their asses! That's how stupid
that motherfucker is. Those cops used
textbook-solid tactics and if Dad were
still here he'd say the same damn
thing.DORISThat doesn't make it right.DEREKYes it does. Yes it does. They're
cops! They are taught to use that
stick and they did.MURRAYExcessively.DEREKNo. Appropriately. Appropriately!
Cops have been granted a certain
amount of authority by society and
white people, unfortunately, are the
only ones who acknowledge it. I
acknowledge a cop's authority.

Davina starts to laugh.DAVINALook who's talking about respecting
the law? Mr. K.K.K. here.DEREKThat's two errors in one sentence,
Davina, so take a fucking course in
semantics. First error--I didn't say
I respect the law. I said I respect a
cop's authority. Second error...I'm
not a member of the fuckin' low rent,
disorganized, redneck Ku Klux Klan..
Pull your head outta your ass and look
at who you're dealing with.MURRAYDon't speak to her that way, Derek.DEREKMurray, stay out of it. You're not a
member of this family and you never
will be.MURRAYWhat the hell does that have to do
with anything?DORIS(to Derek)
You know...sometimes it's hard to
believe I gave birth to you.DEREKGive thanks to the food on the table
and then believe it, Doris.DORISWe both put food on this table, fella.DEREKTrue enough. The point is...if Dan
was walking across the street that
night and Rodney King plowed into him--DORISCan we forget about Rodney King for
chrissake?!DEREK(fiercely continuing)
--while hopped up on Chivas and
P.C.P...you'd consider the force those
cops used to be justified!DORISHe didn't hit anybody!DEREKIf he did though! If that shithead
killed Dan...you would have believed
the beating to be justified and so
would everybody else. But since he
didn't hit anyone...it's "Hands Across
America" for the son of a bitch.

Derek takes a bite of food.DEREKWe are still so hung up in this notion
that we have an obligation to help the
struggling black man and all you
contribute to it! Lincoln freed the
slaves a hundred and thirty years ago!
Get off your fucking asses!STACEYI'm with you, honey. All the way.

Davina drops her silverware on the plate with a clatter
and looks at her mother. Everyone stares at Davina.DAVINA(to Doris)
May I be excused please?DEREKDon't interrupt, Davina.DAVINAI didn't interrupt shit.DEREKThe hell you didn't. I was listening
to Stacey and then I heard you.
That's called interrupting. Wait 'til
she's finished and you can be excused.DAVINAWho the hell do you think you are?

Derek jumps up from the table and grabs her by the back
of the hair.  The table JOLTS and plates tumble to zhe
floor.DEREKYou don't know when to shut up.DORISDammit Derek!MURRAYWhat are you trying to prove, man?!

Derek turns and laughs at Murray.DEREKI'm trying to teach my sister some
respect, Murray.DAVI NALet go of my fucking hair!DEREK(to Murray)
See! See the way she speaks! Tell me
you're gonna shut up and I'll let go.DORISDerek!  Let go of her hair and sit
down!DEREKI will when I hear an answer, Doris.
Are you going to shut up, Davina?

TIGHT ON DANNY. He gets up quickly and tries to pull
Derek off. Derek turns and cracks Danny in the face with

vase with flowers crashes to the floor, just missing
Danny's head.MURRAYJesus!DEREK(to Danny)

Danny nods his head as everyone looks at Derek.DEREKIt's a real easy question, Davina. A
simple yes or no will suffice. Tell
me what I want to hear and I'll let
go.DAVINAFuck...you.

Derek takes a piece of roast beef off her plate and
shoves it in her mouth. Me holds the whole piece inside
so she can't spit it out. Davina cries as she chokes on
the meat.MURRAYShe can't breathe, Derek!DEREKStay back, both of you!  It's her bed,
she's gotta lie in it.
         (grabbing harder)
You can cry all you want, Davina. I'm
not gonna let go until you tell me
what I wanna hear! Are you going to
shut that fat fucking mouth of your's
and let my girlfriend tell her

DORIS grabs him from behind and he aggressively turns on
her. Derek curls his tongue behind his teeth and raises
his arm like he's actually going to smack his mother.
She grabs his arm though, forcefully.DORISLet go of her hair and get out.

Derek releases his grip on his sister and she spits the
roast beef onto the floor. She runs into the back
bedroom crying, choking and coughing.DAVINA (O.S)I hate you, you fucking asshole!

The door slams shut in the background.  Doris, Murray,
Danny, and Stacey all stare at Derek.  Derek calmly faces
his brother.DEREKYou okay?

Danny nods.MURRAY(softly)

Murray stares at Derek with pity.  Doris becomes
emotional.DORIS(to Derek)
Do you think you're the only one who's

Derek focuses on his mother for a moment. A captivated
Danny watches and waits as Derek turns to Murray.DEREKOut of respect for my mother...I'm
gonna let that comment go, Murray. I
won't bash your face in. But let me

Derek holds tight until the crying girl settles down.
He's gripped as desperately by remorse as he was moments
before by rage. He kisses and repeats his apology over

him. Derek looks to Danny.DEREK(hugging Davina)

Doris watches him disappear down the hall, distant
thoughts creeping back slowly.INT. BEDROOM CLOSET - DANNYHe grabs a flannel and throws it on. He sees a cigar box
that rests on the right shelf. He grabs it and looks
inside. The rolled-up LA TIMES clipping reads "Prominent

The two lock eyes. Derek does not flinch. Helicopter
lights shine on the house. COP CARS SCREECH TO A HALT.

DANNY'S POV. Two cops take cover behind their door, draw
their guns, and shout instructions. Derek puts the gun
down, puts his arms behind his head, and drops to his
knees. His eyes are remorseless.DANNY (V/O)Joseph Conrad once wrote that "murder

that okay with you?DORISI'd love it.
     (after a beat)
Do you think I should color my hair?DEREKYes.

He sits beside his mother and enjoys the moment.  He
thinks to himself.DORISI'm glad you made it back. I wasn't
too sure I was going to see you again.
You know how I get.

Filled with regret, he nods.DEREKYou think you'll be able to forgive
me? Someday maybe?DORISYou're my son. Of course I will.

Derek smiles and can't believe his tearful reaction.DEREKLook at me. I'm such a pussy.DORISNo you're not.CUT TO:EXT. VENICE BLVD. - A NEWSPAPER MACHINEDerek plunks a quarter down the slot and removes a copy
of the LA TIMES. Danny continues to skate ahead of him.
Sensing danger, Derek looks back behind him. With no one
in sight, he walks into a doughnut shop.INT. DOUGHNUT SHOP - DEREK'S POVHe takes a guarded look outside. Everything seems
normal. A bus drives by. A group of Mexican laborers,
dressed for work and smiling, walk past in the other
direction.

Inside, a black woman orders a dozen doughnuts from a
short Korean.man behind the counter. Her young daughter
grabs her leg. Danny sits down and reads Derek's paper.DEREKWhat do you want?DANNYMaple bar and a...large milk.

wanders from her mother's leg and over towards Derek.DEREK(to the girl)

She laughs.TISHAThank you.DEREKHow do I look?BLACK GIRL(bashfully)

girl together with his brother.DEREKWhat's your name?BLACK GIRLTisha.DEREKHow old are you, Tisha?

She holds up four fingers. Derek smiles.BLACK MOTHER(staring at Derek)
Come here, Tisha.

Tisha returns to her mother and they quickly exit. Derek
watches the girl as she continues to stare at him as they
make their way down the street.

Outside, a BLUE FORD screeches out front. Rasmussen and
the Young Mark Fuhrman type from earlier get out and
wait. Dr. Sweeney meets the duo and together they walk
inside.DEREKWhat's goin' on?SWEENEYWe need to talk, Derek.DEREKHow'd you find out I was here?SWEENEYWe were just at your apartment.RASMUSSENCammeron and Seth are in the ICU at
St. Johns, Derek. They were jumped in

somebody else.

Derek stares at Rasmussen and walks away.

Derek looks over and analyzes the innocence of his
brother.DEREKI can't, Sweeney.SWEENEYTry, Derek. Okay?

Derek senses the danger in his voice.SWEENEYOkay?  Before it explodes.

Sweeney walks away and then turns back to Derek.SWEENEYAnd watch your back.

Danny hops the fence with his backpack on. He looks back
at Derek. Cops #1 and #2 sit in their car in the b.g.DEREKHey.DANNYWhat?DEREKCome here.

Derek puts his hand over the fence. Danny walks up and
clasps it -- FINGERS INTERTWINED. Derek wants to say one
thing but something else comes out.DEREKI'll see you at home.

Danny smiles at his brother and nods. Danny puts his ear
phones on and heads to class. Derek watches his brother
through the chain-link fence. Danny meets up with Lizzy
and they soon disappear from Derek's sight. Derek turns
and walks down the street.COP #1You need a lift anywhere?DEREKNope.

Henry?LITTLE HENRY(afraid)
What does it look like I'm doin'?DANNYCome on, man, no.  You don't want to
do this. Come on.  Henry?

THE DOOR SMACKS OPEN and Danny moves to grab the pistol.
It discharges and a bullet rockets into Danny's chest.
He SLAMS back into the URINAL and gasps for air. The
force of the pistol knocks Henry to the ground. The two
kids who just entered bolt for help.

Danny slides to the tile, leaving a bloody trail. The
two stare at each other - EYE TO EYE. THE BLOODSTAINED

is raking his lungs.LITTLE HENRY(terrified)

Derek begins to cry outright. He can't control himself.
He lets go of Danny's corpse and charges out into the
hall.INT. HALLWAY - DORIS AND DAVINADerek embraces them. Doris grabs his face -- torn
between love and hate. Guilt-ridden, Derek tears from

right now and I want you to forget
about it!DEREKHow the luck do you know what I'm

Drowning in rage, Derek turns back to a misty eyed
Sweeney.DEREKThey shot him in a fucking...pisshole!SWEENEYAnd goin' after them won't bring him
back. Don't do it, Derek. Please,
man. You've come too far. The war is
over.

Derek contemplates the situation and presses his tongue
against his teeth, crackbrained. Sweeney slowly
approaches and cautiously wraps his arms around the young
man. Derek buries his tearing face in Sweeney's
shoulder.DEREKIt stops now, Sweeney.

Sweeney nods and the two lock eyes. Derek makes his way
back to Doris and Davina and together, they grieve.DANNY (V/O)We've heard it a million times, a
