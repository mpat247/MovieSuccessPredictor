  Rewrite by Steve Oedekerk7/30/02Shady Acres EntertainmentINT. KOWOLSKI'S BAKERY - KITCHEN - DAYA news crew shuttles around a GIGANTIC COOKIE. Standing by
are the KOWOLSKI BROTHERS, GUSTOV and VOL, two SHORT, STOCKY,
MEN, along with MOTHER KOWOLSKI and other bakery family
employees. A "30 YEAR ANNIVERSARY" sign hangs in the
background.
BRUCE NOLAN looks into a make-up mirror, desperately trying
to place a large segment of wayward hair.BRUCEOh, God, no! The hair's wrong.
          This is a bad sign.
               (calling out)
          We really need to get a make-up
          person?!
The segment producer, ALLY LOMAN, steps over.ALLYNot in the budget. And not to                         **worry, you're going to look great
          in this.
She holds out a HAIR NET.BRUCEA hair net? I'm not wearing a hair
          net. I just did the hair.ALLY(matter of fact)
          Health code. In the kitchen or
          around the cookie, you gotta have
          it.BRUCE(to crew: re hair net)
          You guy's should tell me this
          before hand, this is like a huge
          waste of...moose.
Bruce spreads the hair net, bends down out of frame, comes up
looking ridiculous and very disgruntled.BRUCERemind me to swing by an elementary                   *
          school after this and serve lunch.
Ally laughs.2.ALLYYou're a thing of beauty.     In
          three, two, one. . .
Bruce SNAPS from pissed to instant charismatic TV newsman.
(Note: Whenever Bruce speaks on camera he speaks in his
"REPORTER'S VOICE" - that recognizable, too-smooth delivery
that all news reporters seem to have. In mathematical terms
Bruce's version is to the 7th power.)BRUCEFor three decades the Kowolski
          Family Bakery has been a mainstay
          in downtown Buffalo. Known for
          their sinfully rich, cream filled,
          deep fried polski pierogis. And
          the occasional sugar induced coma
          that follows. Today, in honor of
          their 30 year anniversary, Momma
          Kowolski and her sons Gustov and
          Vol, decided to do something, a
          little bit different. Tell me
          guys, how did this idea come about?GUSTOVWell,    Vol said to me, 'Gustov, why
          don't    we make the biggest chocolate
          chip    cookie in Buffalo?' And I
          said,    'Yeah, sure.'BRUCEWow. Fascinating.
Bruce steps up to the HUGE COOKIE.BRUCEThe previous Buffalo cookie record
          was 3 feet, 17 inches baked by
          Gladys Pelsnick. But this behemoth
          cookie clearly proving that Gustov
          and Vol have much more free time.
The Kowolski brothers and all celebrate in the background,
toasting with big mugs of milk. Bruce steps forward, looks
dramatically at camera, slow zoom in as he speaks.BRUCE (CONT'D)As we witness the ceremonial
          toasting with milk it makes one
          pause and think. What are we
          really looking at here?(MORE)3.BRUCE (CONT'D)Is it just a big cookie or does
          this cookie represent the pride of
          Buffalo? Our dedicated and hard
          working citizens the key
          ingredient, with a few nuts thrown
          in.
              (motions his eyes to the
               Kowolski twins)
          And finally, the love of our
          families which provides the warm
          chewy center making our beloved
          Buffalo the sweetest place to live.

Camera is in CLOSE as Bruce signs-off.BRUCE (CONT'D)And that's the way the cookie
          crumbles. I'm Bruce Nolan,
          Eyewitness News.
Bruce's hair net SLIPS UP, PUFFING HIS HAIR INTO A BUN ON THE
TOP OF HIS HEAD. The Kowolskis and bystanders all laugh.
The frame FREEZES.
We PULL BACK from the TV and find Bruce holding the remote,
watching the recorded spot on TV. We are now...INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHTBruce is with his longtime girlfriend, GRACE. She has a box
of photos on the coffee table in front of her organizing them
into a photo album.BRUCESo, what do you think?GRACEIt's good.BRUCEIt sucks. It's a story about a
          cookie. People with eating
          disorders will be riveted,
               (goes into huge pathetic
                fan character)
          Dear Bruce, love the bakery piece.
          I can't wait to vomit so I can make
          room for more cookies.GRACEI thought it was funny. I love the
          hair net. How'd you get it to do
          that?4.BRUCEWhat? I'm cutting that. They made
          me wear that stupid thing. I don't
          even look like myself. The hair is
          one of the most important parts of
          an on camera persona. Right out of
          the gate, I lost the hair
          advantage.
Grace looks at a photo,GRACEOh, my gosh, look at this one. My
          sister is so drunk.
She places it in the album.BRUCEGrace. Try to stay focused here.
          I need your help.GRACEAren't you taking this a little too
          seriously?BRUCEIt's sweeps Grace. It is serious.
           There's an anchor job open. This
           is important. This is our future!
Bruce points to the TV as he says "future," not realizing
he's pointing at the ridiculous image of himself with the
hair net bun. Grace can't help but giggle.GRACEI'm sorry.
Bruce collapses into Grace's arms like a child. He clearly
has a fragile temperament.BRUCE(sighs)
          I'm never going to get anchor doing
          these kind of assignments. I want
          my work to matter.GRACEIt does matter. You're funny. You
          make people smile. Come on, take a
          break, help me put this album
          together.BRUCE(reluctant)
          Alright.
Grace holds up a photo.GRACEOh look at this. It's the first
          day we moved in together.
It's the two of them, younger, laughing.BRUCE(down)
          Yeah, so full of hopes and dreams.GRACEOh, here's me at my sister's
          wedding. I caught the bouquet.
It's a picture of Grace overpowering the other bridesmaids
for the bouquet.BRUCEYou look pretty intense, hun.GRACEWell, I was thinking about you.
Grace cuddles into Bruce.BRUCESo, you're attracted to me in some
          way, is that what you're trying to
          say?
Grace rolls over onto Bruce.GRACEYou have no idea.BRUCEI was saving myself for the wedding
          night, but if you keep this up, I
          may lose my resolve.
Grace stands, pulling Bruce up.GRACEWell, that's the way the cookie
          crumbles.
They kiss, stumbling toward the bedroom.6.BRUCEHey, that's a good line, but you
            need more resonance. From the
            diaphragm.
                (newscaster voice)
            That's the way the cookie crumbles.GRACEOh, say it again.BRUCE(bigger)
            That's the way the cookie crumbles.GRACE(sweet, southern groupie)
            Oh, I just love on-air
            personalities.BRUCE(newscaster voice)
            Well then, let me take these
            clothes off and slip into my hair

is the station manager and Bruce's boss, JACK KELLER, 50's, a
constant furrow in his brow.
Also in the room: Bruce's fellow field reporter and rival
EVAN BAXTER, 30' s , a walking statement. Impeccable posture,

Loman.JACKOkay, promos are approved, let's--ALLYAh, isn't that last one a little

          sweeps.
This hits Bruce hard. A beat of silence.EVANAnd that's the way the cookie

          holding your story in reserve.
          Now, can we get back to the board

slides down into his chair, deflated.INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATERJack is at Bobby's cart, paying for a sandwich. Bruce

          getting desperate man, I am pushing
          forty and what have I got to show
          for it? The point is, I've hit
          some kind of a ceiling here. Some
          kind of anti-Bruce barrierI And
          Evan is just lovin' it, by the way.
          He gets the good stories, he gets

          Evan's an asshole.BRUCEI can be an asshole.16.JACKNo, Bruce.     You can't.
Bruce thinks, then flips Jack's sandwich plate over. It
scatters on the floor. Jack and Bruce stare at each other
for a beat.JACKAre you going to pick that up?BRUCEYeah, I'm sorry.
Bruce bends down, starts picking up Jack's food.BRUCEIt's just- this anchor position

He extends his hand to Bruce.JANITORYou must be Bruce. I've been
          expecting you.BRUCEOh, this is hilarious. So you're
          the boss and the electrician and
          the janitor.36.JANITORNothin' wrong with rollin' up your
          sleeves, son. People underestimate

          Happiest people in the world stink
          like hell at the end of the day.
He strolls down the room, takes a seat behind the big desk.JANITORYour father knew that. He was a
          damn good welder.
Bruce approaches the desk.BRUCEHow do you know my father? And how
          did you get my pager number?JANITOROh, I know a lot about you Bruce.
          Pretty much everything there is to

          done or thought about doin', is
          right there in that file cabinet.

          Wow, a whole drawer. Just for me?

Bruce pulls the drawer and it FLIES OPEN, DRAGGING HIM THEFULL LENGTH OF THE ROOM --The Janitor casually pulls a file.JANITORNow this last entry was a little
          disturbing.

reads from the file.JANITOR(reads, scanning)

GOD AND HIS DESK. He tries again, and again.BRUCEOkay, I don't know how you're doing
          that, but I really gotta go. This

The waitress pours him a cup.42.WAITRESSWe've got a special on soup today.BRUCENo, that's okay.WAITRESSIt's tomato.BRUCEAlright, okay.
She heads off.    Bruce sits thinking.   Could it be real?
He looks at the SUGAR down at the end of the table, holds out
his hand and the SUGAR SLIDES ACROSS THE TABLE RIGHT INTO HIS
HAND. The CREAMER slides into his other hand.
Bruce is half scared, half thrilled. He pours some cream and
sugar into his cup, looks around the table.BRUCEExcuse me I need a spoooo...
Bruce chokes up a spoon into his hands, wipes it off with his
napkin.BRUCEThat's alright, I found one.
The Old Man eyes Bruce suspiciously, gets up and moves
further down the counter.
The Waitress sets down the soup, heads off, then turns back.WAITRESSI lie to my sister.BRUCEWhat?WAITRESS(becoming emotional)

          carpet. Come on.
Sam does. Bruce celebrates, does a happy dance and is
surprised to see Debbie standing there.DEBBIE(re: the peeing dog)
          Looks like your rain dance worked.BRUCEDebbie. Hey. You know, I never
          got to apologize for--DEBBIEI didn't really come to chat, I

albums on the coffee table. She flips through, surprised.DEBBIEThey're full... You did all this?
Bruce nods. Debbie looks at Bruce, sizing him up.DEBBIEYou really hurt her, you know.BRUCEI know.
Debbie starts to go, but turns back.DEBBIEYou know what I do before I go to
          sleep every night? I tuck my kids
          in bed, I eat a scoop of ice cream
          and watch Conan.(MORE)115.DEBBIE (cont'd)
          You know what Grace does? She
          prays. Most of the time for you.
This not only touches Bruce, but it gives him an idea.INT. BRUCE AND GRACE' S APARTMENT - NIGHTBruce sits anxiously at the computer with Sam, checks the e--
mails and types in GRACE CONNELLY. He hits "search". 1,273
entries appear.BRUCEThe woman does pray a lot.
He types in "Grace and Bruce" and eagerly awaits. There are
335 matches. He checks a few...
     "Dear God, please help Bruce to find himself, find
     contentment, find You."
     "Dear God, please help Bruce. He's struggling to find
     meaning."
     "Dear God, help Bruce to be happy. He can't seem to
     find his way..."
Over and over, he finds the same prayer, the same entry every
morning and night for months on end.
Bruce is touched.BRUCEShe still loves me, Buddy.
He KISSES SAM and races out.EXT. DEBBIE HOUSE - NIGHTBruce stands in front of the house with flowers, another
special creation. He looks at the lavish bouquet, then sets
them down, picks a single, normal Daisy from the garden.
Better.
He heads for the door when he hears crying. It's Grace. He
looks up, sees a light on in the upstairs guest room.
He climbs the fire escape and looks in the window.
GRACE is sitting on the bed crying. As Bruce watches her
cry, feeling her emotion, it starts to LIGHTLY RAIN.GRACEPlease God. Please...11 6.Through her tears she is praying.     Bruce looks at her with
total love.GRACEPlease God. I still love him...
Bruce smiles, thankful.GRACE...but I don't want to love him
             anymore. Please God. Help me to
             forget.
                  (cries)
             I don't want to hurt anymore. I
             want to forget.
Bruce just stands there, stunned. He gets it. He raises a
hand, and with a simple wave, he performs an excruciatingly
selfless act. He lets Grace go.ON GRACEHer face changes.     She wipes her eyes.   The pain is lifted.
And it is Bruce now who feels that pain. He looks at Grace.
A sad smile.EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHTRain droplets splash on the river where Bruce first raged at
God. He stands in the middle of the street, looks up
heavenward, weakly. Humble.BRUCEYou win. I' m done. Please. I
             don't want to do this anymore. I
             don't want to be God.
                  (sighs)
             Please, help me.
And with that, the rain stops. The dark clouds slowly open
as beams of light cut through, shining down upon Bruce,
birds begin to chirp.adding to this magical moment as. . .HONK1 HONKIA MAC TRUCK SLAMS THROUGH FRAME, MOWS BRUCE DOWN. His spirit
remains in the same spot, looking confused, then STREAKS UP
heavenward.FLYING POV117.SHOOTING HEAVENWARD like a missile, THROUGH THE CLOUDS,
THROUGH THE SKY to...

A HUGE WHITE ROOM - No walls, just white as far as the eye
can see. The flooring is the whitest of white puffy clouds.
Bruce finds himself standing there. He looks around and when
he turns behind him, he sees GOD. Floating on nothing, as
though sitting in the most royal throne.BRUCEAm I...?GODYou can't expect to kneel down in
          the middle of a highway and live to
          talk about it.BRUCEBut why? Why now?GODI work in mysterious ways, son.
A beat as Bruce takes everything in.BRUCEYou knew it all along. You knew if
          I got everything I wanted, I would
          ruin my life.
God doesn't respond, just listens.BRUCESo I'm dead... Okay. If this is
          what you want. Okay, okay...
God holds up the PRAYER BEADS, tosses them to Bruce. Bruce
looks at the beads, then up at God, puzzled.GODGo ahead, use 'em.BRUCEAlright... I've learned that I
          don't know as much I thought I
          did...GODBoy, you can say that again.BRUCEHey, I'm praying here.118.GODSorry, go.BRUCEIf I could have just one thing in
          the world. It would be for Grace
          to live a happy, joyful life. And
          that she finds someone...
              (getting emotional as he
               realizes what he's
               saying)
          ...that she finds someone that will
          treat her with the love and respect
          that she so deserves.
God smiles the most satisfied of smiles.GODNow that is a prayer.
               (beat)
          Well, I better get on that one.
          See ya, Bruce.
Off Bruce's puzzled reaction he DROPS THROUGH THE CLOUDS --
FALLING POV - BACK DOWN TOWARDS EARTH, back THROUGH THE
CLOUDS, and right INTO ANOTHER WHITE ROOM where...
BRUCE EYES OPEN and he GASPS FOR BREATH.    The PRAYER BEADS
still clutched tightly in his hand.
TWO DOCTORS stop giving Bruce CPR, see that his vitals have
returned. . .NURSEHe's back!INTERNBP 40 over 110 and rising.DOCTOR #1(to Bruce) -
          Bruce? Can you hear me?
               (Bruce nods)
          We almost lost you there.
WIDER ANGLE - The WHITE ROOM is a HOSPITAL ROOM - Bruce is
heavily bruised and bandaged.DOCTOR #1You lost a lot of blood. It wasn't
          easy to find a match - you're a
          very rare blood type.119.Bruce looks to the blood bag, sees "A/B Positive" written on
the side.CLOSE ON BRUCE - THINKING, HIS MIND RACINGBRUCE(groggy whisper)
          A/B Positive...DOCTOR #2 (O.S.)You should thank God for donors.
          We don't have a lot of that type on
          hand.NURSEThere's your angel now.
Bruce turns toward the hospital door and sees...GRACEA cotton swab taped to her arm. Now he remembers where he
heard of that blood type.GRACE(re: her swab)
          I hear that all of this winds up in
          a warehouse somewhere. But you
          know me, I'm a sucker for this
          stuff.
The doctors give Grace the nod to enter as they go, leaving
the two of them alone. Grace tentatively approaches.GRACEI don't even know what I'm doing
          here. But... When I heard that
          you'd been in an accident and that
          you might not make it. . .
She starts to cry.BRUCEHey, I'm okay.GRACEDoes it hurt?BRUCEOnly when I talk., and smile... and
          y'know, exist in general.120.Grace laughs. That's one thing Bruce could always do, is
make her laugh. Grace spots the prayer beads in Bruce's
hand, raises his arm.GRACEOh my gosh, you still have those?
Bruce looks at the prayer beads, then looks at Grace. He
remembers his prayer to God and the emotion wells within himGRACEWhat is it?BRUCENothing. It's just really nice to
          see you.
She goes to him, Bruce sits up a bit and they embrace.DISSOLVE TO:EXT. CITY PARK - DAYA BIG BLOOD DRIVE in progre   ss. Everyone is there, Grace,

          by tavern owner, Joseph French, who
          had a poor knowledge of grammar,
          and did not know how to use the
          possessive apostrophe, so he called
          it French Toast instead of French's
          Toast...
Pull back to reveal BRUCE, crutch under one arm, cast on his
leg, mic in hand, reporting. He's now talking in his OWN
VOICE, much more himself.BRUCEThis is Bruce Nolan at Buffalo's
          first annual "Be the Miracle" blood
          drive. Remember, the life you save

          a close call and, well, can you
          imagine what life would have been
          like without me?
Laughs in the background, from the people that know Bruce.
Bruce walks over to the Kowolski Brothers.121.BRUCEIn honor of this event, the
          Kowolski brothers have baked a one-
          of-a-kind, creation.
The brothers proudly unveil the special cookie and we see
that it's a HUGE SYRINGE SHAPED CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE.BRUCESure, a little creepy and a
          shameless plug, but we love 'em.
              (Bruce breaks off a little
               piece, takes a bite)
          Mmm, good needle. Remember, that's
          Kowolski's bakery. The bakery that
          gets more air time than a high
          speed chase.
Everyone laughs.   The Kowolski brothers beam.
Bruce takes a seat as a VOLUNTEER NURSE pulls up his sleeve,
revealing the prayer beads worn around his wrist. She ties
off his arm, starts to probe for a vein.�BRUCETo be honest, I've never been a big
          fan of shots. . .
The volunteer now is swabbing Bruce's arm and Bruce is
starting to sweat.BRUCE(nervous)
          Okay, we're good to go...They just
          stick it into my arm. Breaking
          through the skin, of course...
The volunteer pulls out the needle and Bruce PASSES OUT COLD.
Gasps, the Nurse leans close, total silence, then:BRUCEBLLLAAAA!Bruce jolts awake making the Nurse and several people jump.

He throws a look to Grace who smiles in return.    The crowd
applauds.BRUCEThis is Bruce Nolan reporting for
