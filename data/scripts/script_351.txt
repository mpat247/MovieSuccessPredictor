       smart but green, hair up in a towel, brushing her teeth. We
       intercut ANDY getting ready and...

       ... we see three or four other GIRLS getting ready too.

1A     A drawer filled with about forty lipsticks slides into                1A
       frame... One of the GIRLS carefully applies shiny lip gloss
       with a brush... ANDY puts on cherry Chapstick...

1B&C   A lacy thong floats through the air... one of the GIRLS pulls        1B&C
       it up her glossy legs... A comfy cotton pair of Jockey
       bikinis is tugged out of a pile... ANDY pulls them on...

1D     A gorgeous pair of slingback heels. One of the GIRLS pulls            1D
       the shoes on while her model handsome boyfriend reclines on
       crisp white sheets, watching her.

1E     A pair of comfortable wedges... ANDY dresses while NATE,              1E
       rumpled, unshowered, wearing an old Alice in Chains t-shirt,
       watches her, reclining in mismatched bed-in-a-bag sheets...

1F&G   A series of quick cuts... ANDY eats a full breakfast -- eggs,        1F&G
       bacon, bagel... One of the GIRLS carefully counts out seven
       almonds and pours a huge cup of black coffee...

1H&I   ANDY straightens a pile of newspaper clips from the Daily            1H&I
       Northwestern with the byline ANDREA SACHS and proudly tucks
       them into her hideous college-graduation-present briefcase...
       One of the GIRLS takes Listerine breath strips, keys and a
       Gucci moneyclip and shoves everything in a tiny Fendi clutch.2      EXT. NEW YORK CITY -- DAY                                              2The GIRLS, looking flawless, fold their legs into taxis and
       town cars as ANDY trots down the street and into the subway.3      INT. OFFICE BUILDING LOBBY -- DAY                                      3ANDY strides into an office building, confident. A GUARD

We
    widen out to see ANDY, bucking the flow like a salmon going
    upstream.

    She gets to an intersection, starts to cross the street...

    ...and just misses being decked by a bike messenger.5   EXT. ELIAS-CLARKE -- DAY                                              5ANDY sees a tower looming in front of her. Elias-Clarke.

    Streaming into the building are the polished GIRLS we saw in
    the opening... their heels click-clack on the concrete...

    They are the CLACKERS of Elias-Clarke. ANDY runs in.6   OMITTED                                                               67   INT.

    ANDY looks at them, then down at herself. If they're fat,
    what am I? Ding! Elevator opens and ANDY exits.8   INT. ELIAS-CLARKE HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICE -- DAY                       8ANDY sits across from SHERRY, 40's. On the wall are covers
    from the Elias-Clarke magazines -- a news magazine, a cooking
    magazine, a fitness magazine... and Runway.

    ANDY is unloading clips from her horrible briefcase.ANDYThis article was about the Take Back

     an elegant logo that says RUNWAY. ANDY walks over.ANDYHi, I have an appointment with Emily

     (EMILY (and MIRANDA, later) pronounce ANDREA Ahn-DRAY-a. ANDY
     refers to herself as AN-dree-a.)

     ANDY turns and sees a taller, thinner and, amazingly, more
     groomed CLACKER. This is EMILY. She looks the part of the
     sleek fashionista, but is propelled by a core of barely
     tamped down anxiety. She examines ANDY.EMILY (CONT'D)Human Resources certainly has a
                  bizarre sense of humor.

                  two girls after only a few weeks. We
                  need to find someone who can survive
                  here. Do you understand?ANDYYes. Of course. Who's Miranda?EMILY(eyes widening)
                  You didn't just ask me that. She's the
                  editor in chief of Runway. Not to
                  mention a legend. Work a year for her
                  and you can get a job at any magazine
                  you want. A million girls would kill
                  for this job.ANDYSounds great. I'd love to be
                  considered.

     She smiles. EMILY tries to think how to break it to her.EMILYAndrea, Runway is a fashion magazine.
                  An interest in fashion is crucial.ANDYWhat makes you think I'm not
                  interested in fashion?

     EMILY gives her a look. ANDY smiles, like she has no idea
     what EMILY could mean.

     Suddenly, EMILY'S Blackberry goes off. She gasps.EMILYOh my God. No. No, no, no.ANDYWhat's wrong?11   EXT.

     MIRANDA maintains a high rate of speed towards the elevator.

     glass, reaches into the fridge, pours a Pellegrino. Races
     into MIRANDA'S office. Races back out. Grabs an armful of
     magazines and newspaper from her desk and runs back into

     professional. Or fakes it.

     MIRANDA to her office.MIRANDAI don't understand why it's so
                  difficult to confirm an appointment.EMILYI'm so sorry, Miranda. I did confirm
                  last night, but--MIRANDAThe details of your incompetence do

     MIRANDA gestures impatiently. EMILY hands her the clipboard.
     MIRANDA peruses it as they walk down the hall.MIRANDA (CONT'D)Tell Simone I'm not approving the girl
                  she sent in for the Brazil layout. I

     We see large framed photo of MIRANDA, her husband STEPHEN and
     her twin GIRLS, CASSIDY and CAROLINE, in the Hamptons.

     And her tone is very remote. And now we can see JAMES really
     start to quake.

     MIRANDA arranges herself on the Mies daybed, legs folded,
     ramrod straight. The other RUNWAY editors -- NIGEL, JOCELYN
     and LUCIA and their assistants, stand behind MIRANDA.

     JAMES and his people stand off to the side as a few fit
     MODELS begin walking out in various outfits.JAMESThis season I started to think about
                  the intersection of East and West...

     trying desperately to impress MIRANDA. He's practically tap-
     dancing.JAMES (CONT'D)I didn't want to do, say, a blonde in
                  a kimono. It's more about capturing
                  the Eastern sensibility in the Western
                  woman. Kind of Uma Thurman in Kill
                  Bill in a kick ass dress with an obi
                  belt. The modern woman as Geisha meets
                  rock star, with a little Desperate
                  Housewives thrown in.

     Suddenly, there's a glimpse of movement from Miranda -- could
     it be a nod? Everyone holds their breath.

     No, she's just straightening her glasses.JAMES (CONT'D)And this, of course, is the dress
