                           Etan Cohen & Lowell CunninghamCLOSE ON A PAIR OF MIRROR AVIATOR SUNGLASSESStandard issue throughout the south to abusive, racist prison
          guards.

          Widen to reveal that, indeed, these glasses are on the
          sneering face of just such a man.
          We follow the guardDOWN A DINGY PRISON HALLWAYPaint peeling off the rusty bars. Somewhere, someone is
          playing harmonica. Prisoners yell complaints as he passes.
          He meets them all with--GUARDShut up, convict! Get yer hands
          off the bars!

          The guard passes through several levels of security doors,
          deeper and deeper into the more secure bowels of the prison --
          home of the scum of the scum.
          Meanwhile...PRISON VISITING ROOMThe lazy-ass guards in charge of screening visitors read
          magazines, watch TV. Footsteps -- someone's here. Which
          pisses them off, because that means they actually have to do
          their jobs.

          The unseen visitor buzzes for help. They take their time
          getting off their asses. When they finally look up, their
          gaze becomes a leer. Follow it to:
          DEVIL GIRL, the visitor. Too tall, too muscled, but hot if
          you're into that kind of thing -- an R. Crumb drawing come to
          life.

          She holds a CAKE -- the cutest, perfectly-frosted pink cake
          right off the cover of the Betty Crocker cookbook.GUARD 2Lookie here. Yaz's visitor. I
          guess even a turd gets flies to
          land on it.GUARD 3Me, I like a big girl.2.They smirk, hoping for a reaction. Devil girl emits a low,
          sinister growl like an angry Doberman... The guards look at
          each other and GET DOWN TO BUSINESS:GUARD 2I.D., visitation papers.BACK DOWN THE HALLWAY WITH THE GUARDHe reaches the end of the hallway. The biggest, most
          absurdly-reinforced double security door. He punches in a
          code.
          The giant door retracts -- its immense weight has it
          squeaking and groaning the whole way. Whoever's behind this
          thing must've done something REAL bad.WITH DEVIL GIRLGoing through the metal detectors, waved over with security
          wands. The guards are being thorough. Maybe more thorough
          than they need to be. They check everything -- even the
          cake. The digital readout tells them NO METAL DETECTED.GUARD 3She's clean. Well, not CLEAN, but
          you know.
          They laugh, buzz her through.WITH THE GUARDThe giant door finally opens, he continues to the end of the
          hallway. Stops in front of a cell. Yells in:GUARDHey, Yaz! You got a visitor.
          Let's go, pretty boy.VISITING ROOMSpare. Just a table and chairs in the middle -- poured
          concrete. Nothing a convict could, say, smash into the face
          of a guard.
          The perimeter of the room is lined with armed guards -- looks
          like they're not taking chances.3.At the lone table -- Devil Girl waits with her cake. She
          hears the door open -- her face lights up as IN STEPS HERBELOVED --YAZ, an evil hippie/biker badass right out of Easy Rider. A
          huge mane of hair, a big handlebar moustache that frames a
          grubby unshaven face...
          Everything about him seems strangely independently alive --
          every strand of hair, every fringe on his dirty jacket -- the
          way Elvis was in his prime.
          He wears a distinctive SKULL PINKIE RING. A smirk plays on
          his mouth that says -- I'm smarter than you, asshole.
          The guards escort Yaz, who can barely walk in his CHAINS and
          MANACLES. They dump him into one of the chairs. Devil Girl
          jumps up, they lock in a kiss -- it goes on too long.
          A guard pokes them with his billy club --GUARD 2This ain't a conjugal visit.
          quit yer conjugating.YAZWhen's the last time you conjugated
          anything?DEVIL GIRLI brought you a cake.YAZThanks, darling.(TO GUARDS)Hey could you cut this up for us?
          It's our anniversary. I'm romantic
          like that.
          A guard picks up the cake. Smirks and takes a dirty three-
          fingered scoop of frosting.GUARD 2(MOUTH FULL)Not great. She must.be good at
          somethin' else.
          They all LAUGH. He goes back for another scoop.YAZI wouldn't do that.GUARD 2Why's that, convict?4.GUARD POV:Where he scraped away the frosting, REVEAL A HORRIBLE ALIENMOUTHGUARD 2 (CONT'D)WHAT TH--But in a flash, the mouth SPRINGS OUT -- IT BELONGS TO A
          VORACIOUS ALIEN -- another springs out behind it -- they
          consume the guard's entire face.YAZThat's why.
          The aliens jump into Yaz's hands like a matching pair of
          grotesque ORGANIC SIDEARMS -- as vicious and bloodthirsty as
          their master, snarling and hungry for blood.
          The guards draw their weapons, but YAZ IS FASTER.-- he
          launches his aliens, taking them all out.
          Yaz "holsters" the aliens and...THE PRISON BREAK IS ON!!One guard, badly wounded, crawls to SOUND THE ALARM
          In the reflection of a pair of blood-spattered aviator
          glasses -- Devil Girl puts the guard down with his own
          weapon.
          She uses one of the cake-aliens like a saw to get Yaz out of
          his chains.YAZThere's nothing sexier than a girl
          killing for me.

          She runs a hand over his bicep.DEVIL GIRLYou got so strong in prison.

          Yaz notices the almost-dead guard:YAZI'm not just a man of brute force,
          you know. I prefer to be known for
          my rapier wit--
          His tongue SHOOTS OUT OF HIS MOUTH -- like a rapier --
          impaling the guard--5.YAZ (CONT'D)--and tongue.
          The tongue retracts -- he and Devil Girl KISS.
          They collect weapons off the guards and use the aliens to saw
          open the door.YAZ AND DEVIL GIRL ESCAPEPrisoners go nuts, guards scramble -- smoke, screaming,
          chaos.
          Yaz and Devil Girl, armed with weapons they took off the dead
          guards, BLAST THEIR WAY OUT.
          He's a sociopathic badass... and she's no slouch either.
           Along the way, Yaz shoots the door off the armory and grabs
          an armload of weapons -- Shotguns, pistols, and a Rocket-
          Propelled grenade (RPG).
          He uses and discards them as he goes.
          They head for the front gate and FREEDOM...
          But..
          They turn the corner and find 50 GUARDS in FULL RIOT GEAR --
          Plexiglass shields, helmets, shotguns -- all aimed at Yaz.
          All Yaz has left is his RPG.GUARD ON MEGAPHONEGive it up, Yaz! There's no way
          out!
          A beat of stand-off -- Yaz and Devil girl facing off against
          the 50 Guards... No one blinking...
          Prisoners. watching... what's gonna go down?GUARDYou can't win. You've only got one
          shot in there!
          Yaz lets the tension linger -- he seems to enjoy it. The
          guards SWELTER in their heavy riot gear.YAZYou look hot. Mind if I open a
          window?6.The guards share a look - huh?? Yaz grins, turns his RPG
          towards the wall behind the guards. The guards' faces goWIDE WITH TERROR.GUARDHey! Whoa! What are you doing?
          Don't do that!SLAM!Yaz blasts a hole in the wall -- the guards are IMMEDIATELY
          SUCKED OUT like from a hole blown in an airplane.
          What the...?
          Yaz steps through the hole.ON YAZAs he and Devil girl step through the hole, take a deep,
          satisfied breath of FREEDOM.
          Reveal we are on...THE SURFACE OF THE MOONThe signage on the prison reads INTERGALACTIC DEPARTMENT OFCORRECTIONS, LUNAR DIVISIONYaz looks up at the BLUE MARBLE OF EARTH, smiles.
          As Yaz fixes his gaze on our planet, his hair, his fringes
          INDEPENDENTLY ARTICULATE YAZ'S MALEVOLENT EMOTIONS... they
          also seem drawn here. Like bees, they express a collective
          intelligence.YAZI'm coming for you...
          Following Yaz's gaze to the Earth, we launch into...CREDITSMiB credits fly us through the Galaxy.
          Ending on a PARTICULARLY INHOSPITABLE LOOKING PLANET
          As it revolves, we observe its strange craters and surface,
          where steaming fissures belch geysers of noxious gases...7KAY'S VOICE (V.0.)When you really think about it, the
          universe is a pretty awful place.
          Full of danger, brutality, and ten
          million kinds of scum. So the
          trick is to find one or two things
          that make life in this cesspool
          worth living.
          And reveal we are actually looking at...PEKING DUCKRotating on a spit.
          JAY and KAY watch this awful duck rotate.JAYThat? That nasty, greasy thing
          makes your life worth living?
          There's people eating here, younger
          than that duck.KAYI was talking about the noodles.
          Best noodles in town.
          And we are inINT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - CHINATOWN, NYC - NIGHTTanks everywhere filled with strange fish. An eclectic NY
          crowd eats -- Wall Street guys, hipsters, a Chinese family or
          two, a couple of NYU professor types who love the
          "authenticity" of this place.
          KAY flashes a badge to the OWNER, Chinese.KAYGood evening, Mr. Wu.MR. WU(heavily accented, barelyINTELLIGIBLE)Kay, Jay... So happy see you... Mr.

          a look in the tanks.8MR. WUYes, you see, very fresh.JAYThe tanks in the back, Wu.MR. WUOh... so sorry... please no
          English, you come back later...JAYHey, save the chop socky bullshit
          for the locals, Wu. We need to see
          the kitchen.MR. WU(PERFECT ENGLISH)Why are you busting my balls, Jay?KAY (O.S.)Jay, take a look at this.
          Wu protests, Jay blows by him.THE KITCHENKAYSo this is what you're passing off
          as tuna?
          Reveal a giant tank holding a HUGE ALIEN FISH.JAYWow, I didn't think there was
          anything uglier than a catfish.
          Jay taps on the glass -- the fish SNARLS, making Jay JUMP.KAYUgly AND a clear violation of
          Health ordinance 32, sellingUNLICENSED EXTRATERRESTRIALfoodstuffs.MR. WUThat's an earth fish. Very
          traditional from China. You arrest
          me, that's hate crime.
          They turn their stares on him.9.KAYI guess it would be.
          (grabbing Wu's apron)
          If you were Chinese!
          Reveal -- from the waist down, Wu has the BODY OF A SLUG.MR. WUC'mon, I got larvae to feed. And
          earth fish is so expensive. This
          is the only way I could stay
          afloat.JAYLook, Wu. You can serve it to
          your... out of town guests, but
          locals get earth fish. REAL earth
          fish. The kind that doesn't jump
          out of their stomach and get
          everyone asking a lot of annoying
          questions. Like, "Why is my lunch
          eating Daddy?" You got it?

          weird?KAYYeah, look -- clean fork.10.JAYLook at table two over there. They
          haven't ordered a thing. When's
          the last time Wu let someone sit at
          a table without ordering? And
          table five over there just drank
          his third cup of duck sauce.
          Now Kay's radar is up --KAYCome to think of it... Why is Wu
          getting our noodles... outside?JAYBecause it's about to go down.
          Wu, at the door, closes the blinds. He catches them looking.MR. WUSorry, guys.
          Wu leaves, quickly pulling the door behind, him. The guys
          reach for their weapons.
          And IT GOES DOWN --
          It's a SET-UP, and everyone in the restaurant is in on it --
          The hipsters, the families, the wall street guys -- all draw
          various forms of ALIEN WEAPONS and ATTACK
          It's like a close-quarters Mafia hit -- everyone pumping
          truckloads of ordnance at each other. Close hand-to-hand
          combat. Someone wants Jay and Kay dead and they're not
          taking any chances.
          Right ahead of the onslaught, JAY GIVES KAY A HAND SIGNAL --
          He nods, and they dive in opposite directions, SAVINGTHEMSELVES FROM GETTING HIT.But not for long...
          An explosive lands between them --
          Kay gets BLOWN OUT THE FRONT WINDOW, rolls to a stop in the
          middle of theDESERTED STREETSilhouetted at the top of the block -- a biker on a
          motorcycle. As he pulls into the light -- YAZI11.Kay's eyes go wide with recognition.

          A messy battle THROUGH THE KITCHEN.
          The Giant fish's tank gets shot -- the FISH IS FREE! And he
          goes RIGHT AFTER JAY!JAYYou probably took that whole
          catfish thing the wrong way --
          The fish SNARLS AFTER HIM -- lunges and BITES!JAY (CONT'D)I was jealous, you know? Because
          you're so pretty!
          Jay BATTLES THE FISH-- throwing pots and pans in its mouth,
          squirting hot sauce -- working like a lion tamer to keep itAT BAY--JAY (CONT'D)Kay! KAY!!! Little help! Little
          help!OUTSIDE WITH KAYYaz getting closer. He pulls out a CANNON of a gun, fires
          into the air.YAZThis time you don't have your
          friends to tell you what happens
          next.KAYOh, I know what happens next.12.Kay draws his EQUALLY BADASS-LOOKING WEAPON --KAY (CONT'D)I've been waiting forty years for
          another shot at you, scum.

          Kay throws the gun at Yaz.
          Yaz laughs. Gets Kay in his sights.YAZAll I wanted was justice, Kay.
          Justice for my brothers. But you
          had to meddle, didn't you?KAYThey deserved what they got.YAZWhy don't you say that to their
          faces when you see them...
          Puts the barrel in Kay's face and BOOM!!!
          Yaz goes up in a GIANT EXPLOSION!!
          Reveal Jay, just fired the shot.
           Jay looks like total hell, beaten up, covered with 8 kinds of
          slime and alien guts.
          He stumbles over to Kay, who in contrast looks perfectly
          pressed.JAYSo I was thinking about making a
          chart for each time I save your
          ass. And when I do it ten times,
          you buy me lunch.13.Kay lets out a long, weary sigh.KAYWill you settle for a drink?INT. DESTROYED CHINESE RESTAURANTKay reaches behind the counter for a couple of beers. Jay is
          on his phone.JAY(INTO PHONE)We're gonna need a cleanup on the
          corner of Canal and Mott. And
          bring a net. Biggest one you've
          got.
          Follow Jay's gaze -- the giant fish flops its way down Canal.
          Jay and Kay back in their booth, Jay grabs a couple noodles
          off another table and starts eating.
          Through the scene, various MiB clean-up crew people work the
          crime scene.JAY (CONT'D)(MOUTH FULL)Why aren't you eating?(GETS NOTHING)So what the hell was that guy?
          Kay's quiet. Ominously quiet. Weighing his words:KAYYaz. Put him away a long time ago.
          Biggest mistake I ever made.JAYWhy? Was he the wrong guy?KAYNo. Should've killed him.JAYYeah, well, don't worry, I think I
          took care of him.KAYThat was too easy.JAYI make it look easy. That's the
          problem with being my partner.(MORE)14.JAY (CONTD)You get used to my game. It's what
          Dr. Phil would call taking for
          granted.KAYYou don't get it, hoss. This guy
          is different. Worse than anyone.
          He tried to blow up the Earth but I
          stopped him. He developed a
          dislike for me and for certain
          behaviors of mine, such as being
          alive.JAYC'mon, you know better {than anyone.
          What does an MiB agent call it when
          12 alien species try to kill him?
          Tuesday.
          Jay laughs at his own joke. Kay just stares.KAYMaybe.
          (calling off to cleanupGUYS)Make sure you get all of him, I
          mean it! He's an assembler!CLEANUP GUYYes, sir, Agent Kay.JAYSeriously, man, those noodles'll
          kill you before he does. I got
          your back.KAYI know you do.
          Stares at his noodles a while, like there's answers in there:KAY (CONT'D)I used to play a game with my
          daddy. What would you want for
          your last meal. Could do worse
          than this.JAYOh, yeah? I used to play a game
          with my dad, too. Called catch.
          I'd throw the ball, and then it'd
          hit the house `cause he WASN'TTHERE.15.KAYDo me a favor, don't badmouth your
          old man.JAYHard to badmouth someone you don't
          know.(CHECKS HIMSELF)Alright, forget it. The past is
          the past. And right now we have
          something much more important to
          talk about. Bowling Night.KAYI'm tired.JAYTired? What -- you afraid I'm
          gonna take that MVP trophy away
          from you?KAYPetrified. See you later.
          Kay takes a few tired steps and turns back --KAY (CONT'D)And slick? Watch yourself. A guy
          like Yaz can come after you when
          you least expect it. Anywhere,
          anytime.
          Jay watches Kay walk away. Looks like he's carrying a heavy
          load. Turns his attention to the clean up crew:KAY (CONT'D)What part of clean up everything
          don't you understand? There's a
          spleen on that car!CLEANUP GUYOn it, sir.DARK ALLEYA glow of a cigarette illuminates the face of... Devil Girl!

          MiB agents and aliens say hi, exchange trash-talk.
          We see shots of games in progress:
          An alien rolls a ball -- when it gets to the end of the lane,
          it sticks out arms, taking down all the pins.17.The aliens cheer, slap tentacles, clink beers and swallow
          them whole. A many-armed alien re-sets the pins.
          A giant alien with perfect dainty form approaches the foul
          line... and -- gutter ball! He gets mad and shoots the pins
          with his laser-eyes.

          Jay grabs the YAZ FILE -- the one he looked through last

          the missile shield --- Kay -- the
          real Kay -- loved that thing. He
          wouldn't shut up about it. I mean,
          that thing was all Kay.(REALIZING)But Kay's dead. He's been dead for
          years. But I knew him yesterday.

          Jay runs through Time Square, where guys sell stuff on

          Desperately looking for someone...
          Among the sellers, a suspicious-looking guy wearing a strange
          mixture of anachronistic clothing -- tri-cornered hat.
          As soon as he sees Jay, his eyes go wide and HE FLEES.

          was playing in the Apple store -- now continues as the 60s
          song itself, played over a tinny portable radio.
          He hops up just as a young white office worker comes out of
          one of the stalls, washes his hands... and flips Jay a
          quarter.
          Jay stares at it a beat, confused. Misreading his confusion,
          the office worker awkwardly digs out another quarter.OFFICE WORKERWhat the heck, you're doing a great

          climbs in with a car full of older executives.
          Jay shakes his head, just taking this all in.JAY (CONT'D)Wow. 1969. You're all dead now.

          Jay finds some classic 60s music and enjoys himself for a
          minute -- a sweet ride through 60s New York.
          A GREAT 1969 HIT -- THE TEMPTATIONS' "Can't Get Next to You"
          comes on the radio. Jay is swept up in the music and soon isSINGING ALONG AT FULL BLAST.At a light, he pulls even with an older Brooklyn Italian

          (including a TV hooked up to something strange with tons of
          wires hanging out) and lots of money.. LOTS of money...
          Not just piles -- the actual furniture is MADE OF STACKS OF
          MONEY. They've been using it for scrap paper, for napkins.JAYSo Yaz was never after you... he
          was after the Archanans. You just

          Then, faintly... a CHEERKAYHold that thought.
          They follow it out toTHE TRACKWhich is empty. No spectators, no horses. Just the
          Archanans...
          Who stand near the track watching... nothing.
          And yet --
          They cheer and clap as if watching the most exciting race
          ever.
          Jay and Kay exchange a "what the hell?" Look and approach
          them.JAYEverybody OK?ARCHANANSEverybody is everybody.70.JAYYeah... guess I can't argue with
          that. So listen up -- Yaz is down
          but he won't be for long, so we
          need to start coming up with some
          answers. First of all--
          The Archanans CHEER. Jay shakes it off.JAY (CONT'D)FIRSTThe Archanans CHEER AGAIN.JAY (CONT'D)What are you cheering about?!ARCHANANSThe races.
          Jay and Kay keep approaching... Puzzled -- the track is
          empty...JAYWhat races?
          Jay and Kay cross the threshold into their aura... and now--
          The empty stands are FILLED WITH CHEERING SPECTATORS WATCHINGAN INCREDIBLY EXCITING RACE.JAY (CONT'D)Where are we?LAMA.We are tomorrow.
          Jay steps backwards, out of the aura -- back to empty ghost
          town.
          Steps back in -- tomorrow's rabid fans, cheering the race.
          From the Archanans' POV -- we see ALL VERSIONS/ALL AGES OFJAY AND KAY..The effect is -- THEY SEE ALL TIME AT ONCE.JAYYou... can see the future.LAMAIt is what you call the future.71.ATTENDANTAh, the future. An illusion of the
          time-bound, borne of the fallacy
          that one moment follows another.LAMAYaz suffers from this greatly. And
          so he must have revenge on your
          planet.JAYRevenge?, For what?LAMAHe mourns the past because he can
          not see the dead are still as alive
          as they ever were. Just not now.JAYOkay, someday you're gonna explain
          that to me, but right now you need
          to stop the riddles because there's
          about two minutes until Yaz crawls
          out of his hole and gets back to
          trying to kill you. So help me
          out. I need to know IN ENGLISH why
          Yaz is trying to kill you and what
          that has to do with saving the
          Earth.ATTENDANTWe know what he will know.JAYYou know what... he will know...
          (figuring it out)
          You know his plans.(REALIZING)And you're going to stop him. He
          wants to kill you because you stop
          him.LAMA(CHEERFUL)Yes, if he does not kill us first.KAYDon't you know if he's going to?LAMASometimes he kills us, sometimes he
          does not. There are many futures.72.JAYOkay, which future is the one where
          you live and the Earth doesn't blow
          up?LAMAThe one where you take us home.

          Jay and Kay look for an escape route -- but MiB cars and
          trucks seem to be pouring in from everywhere.
          MiB agents descend on ropes, round up the Archanans--EX (V.0.)(MEGAPHONE)Agent Kay! Return to your vehicle!

          Inside the conference room -- the Archanans sit around a
          table.
          Ex paces, clearly talking ABOUT the Archanans to the other
          agents.
          Body language tells us the MiB reach some kind of consensus.
          Ex comes out -- Jay and Kay hop up.
          Ex notices Jay for the first time --EXWhat's he doing here? Didn't we
          just bust you?KAYThat was someone else. All these
          mooners look alike, right?
          A beat -- and Ex buys it completely.EXYeah... So look. We've talked
          about it. And you are to be
          commended, Agent Kay. You did a
          fine job bringing these illegals
          in. Now it's our job to get them
          out of the city for containment.
          Somewhere where if someone decides
          to blow them off the map, the
          collateral damage will be
          insignificant. Toronto.KAYBut they're in danger. One of the
          most dangerous beings in the

          And if that happens, we're all
          going with them, because they're

          Mooner who showed up telling us how
          they were gonna save the world,

          our nose into other people's
          business. Especially people in
          danger, because they have enemies,
          and those enemies destroy Earth.

          Kay walks up to Ex, looks him DEAD IN THE EYEKAYIt sounds like you need to cut some
          eyeholes in your stomach, because

          together, but NOT AT ALL RIGHT -- a leg stuck in the wrong
          place, the head at a weird angle.
          He catches his reflection in a hubcap and adjusts himself...
          Pops out an eye, swaps an arm...

          He trails off as they EMERGE FROM THE BRUSH
          And stop dead...JAY (CONT'D)Whoa. So that's how you're getting
          home.

          The huge crowd, the security, the press. HISTORY IN THEMAKING.T-Minus 30 minutes.JAYOkay. So we've got... 30 minutes
          to get past security. Get into
          Mission Control. Reprogram the
          flight path, pull the Astronauts
          off the launch and get them in that
          rocket.KAYWell, then. Better get started.JAYWeird. I feel like I've been here.(BEAT)Okay, I've got a plan to get
          through security. We just need to
          be invisible.87.YAZ ON HIS BIKEHurtling down the highway on his superfast bike, kicking up aHUGE DUSTSTORM...He gets STUCK BEHIND AN 18-WHEELER.

MISSION CONTROL STRUCTURE ENTRANCEHeavily guarded by AIR FORCE SECURITY -- people with a lot of
          guns and very little sense of humor.
          And up steps Jay, leading Kay and the Archanans.JAY (O.S.)'Scuse me... I need to get
          inside... I've got the big man's
          Cadillac... all washed and ready to-
          Before the words are out of Jay's mouth, he's down on the
          ground with a submachine gun stuck in his neck.GUARDMove and it's the last thing you
          do!
          The security is on Kay and the Archanans, forcing them down.
          Kay gives Jay a look --KAYGood work. It's like we're not
          even here.GUARD(INTO RADIO)Sir, this is unit 3 bravo -- we
          have an attempted perimeter breach

          We'll hold them here, sir.JAYYou've got it wrong, let me explain-88.GUARDShut up! Anything you have to say,
          you can say to my superior officer!
          And boy does he hate your kind...
          A click... click... click... Someone is approaching. Someone
          who walks like they mean business.GUARD (CONT'D)Lt. Colonel! Here are the
          intruders, sir!
          Jay cranes to see the Colonel -- he's African American. Jay
          grins, relieved --JAYFinally, someone I can talk to--
          But the Colonel is on him before you can blink, an equal-
          opportunity hardass to the extreme:COLONELThe only thing we're gonna talk
          about is what specific breed of
          dumbass you have to be to try to
          penetrate my launch site!
          He begins patting Jay down. Eyes widen --COLONELWeapon! You are going away for a
          long time...
          (to his men)
          Get them into holding. We'll
          interrogate them after the launch.
          A beat... and Jay goes for it:JAYSir, before you do that --- my name
          is Agent Jay. I appreciate your
          position, but I'm from a top-secret
          government agency in charge of
          protecting the world from the scum
          of the universe and right now, on
          behalf of the people of Earth, I.:
          need to commandeer your rocket soTHEY--(points to Archanans)
          --can board it. Can we count on
          your help?
          The Colonel stares at him for a beat..89.COLONELSo you want us to stop the most
          massive endeavor in American
          history, an event being watched by
          the entire world, the moment that
          will be the culmination of a
          challenge put to us by President
          John F. Kennedy himself... so a
          bunch of Hare Krishnas can take a
          joy ride?JAYWould it help if I told you I'm
          from the future?COLONELGet them out of here!
          He motions to the other MPs, who move to roust the group...
          But the Lama takes the Colonel by the arm--COLONEL (CONT'D)Hey!
          --and PULLS HIM INTO HIS AURA.
          On THE COLONEL'S face... He sees something POWERFUL
          The Lama releases him...
          The officer is stunned for a moment. Blinks back into focus
          and turns to the other guards --COLONEL (CONT'D)You men are no longer needed here.
          Report to delta gate.GUARDSir?COLONELGo!GUARDYes, sir...
          The Colonel turns to Jay, Kay and the Archanans:COLONELThe rest of you, come with me.
          The Colonel heads into the building. They follow.90.JAYThings change when you can see the
          future, right?COLONELThey sure do. This is definitely
          about some next-level shit.
          The PA crackles:P.A. (V.0.)T-minus seven minutes to launch...MISSION CONTROL STRUCTURE - UNDERGROUND HALLWAYMission control is an underground hub with hallway "spokes".
          Jay, Kay and the Archanans follow the Colonel down the
          hallway towards the main Mission Control center.MISSION CONTROLA hive of activity leading up to the launch.. Miles and
          miles of white guys in buzzcuts and shortsleeve button-down
          shirts. Thick glasses, slide rules, pocket protectors -- a
          sea of IBM men.
          Everyone smoking, RUSHING AROUND, LAST-MINUTE CHAOS...
          Hunkered over computer monitors... reel-to-reel data tapes
          spinning. Less computing power than an iPhone, but we put a
          man on the moon.P.A. (V.0.)T-minus six minutes...JAYAttention, everyone! We've got a
          change in plans!
          Everyone's consumed with the launch and wearing headsets --
          they ignore him -- he keeps trying --JAY (CONT'D)Hey! Attention over here! I need
          to talk to the man who can re-
          program this rocket!
          Still nothing --JAY (CONT'D)Can anyone hear me? Hey! You in
          the glasses!91.25 people in identical giant black plastic glasses turn.COLONEL (O.S.)Agent Jay! Over here!
          They see the Colonel with an Engineer at a workstation.COLONEL (CONT'D)This is your man.
          The guys approach the Engineer --ENGINEERYou see this card? The rocket's
          flight path is all on cards just
          like this one. Right here --
          He indicates a long metal rack, like a mail-sorting machine,
          that holds many 1000s of cards and feeds them into a
          processor.
          An Archanan approaches and BLOWS ON THE CARDS -- it hits the
          cards like a mini-whirlwind. The cards spiral everywhere
          like bats pouring out of a cave -- chads fly off -- they're
          magically re-programmed! And fly back into the rack.
          The engineers are STUNNED. And then PANIC:ENGINEER (CONT'D)The trajectory has been altered!
          A BIG LOW-TECH GRAPHIC APPEARS on the BIG LOW-RES MONITOR:TRAJECTORY CHANGE.ENGINEER (CONT'D)Abort launch! Abort launch!JAYSlow down there! Everyone be cool!ENGINEERCoolness is an inappropriate

          on me?KAYLittle something I've been working
          on. Glasses if you've got 'em.

          look of the posters...JAYHa ha, just like old times...KAYOh, and you might want to get under
          a desk.JAYGet under a--?ENGINEEROne!
          The engineers hand comes down... but before he can hit theBUTTON --Kay hits the trigger --
          But instead of a FLASH --
          A MILLION PELLETS EXPLODE OUT OF THE NEURALIZER -- bouncing
          everywhere, knocking out the engineers.
          The pellets KEEP WHIZZING EVERYWHERE THROUGH THE FOLLOWING:
          Jay and Kay have to talk over the sounds of people getting
          KO'd.93.JAYWhat the hell was that??KAYIt's a high-velocity non-lethal
          pellet-gun. The boys in the lab
          call it the "hiv-nol-pog."JAYCatchy.
          The Archanans deftly step out of the way -- or the pellets
          swerve around them.
          EX RUNS IN, flanked by security and/or MiB agents.EXIt's Kay! There he is! Take him
          down! Shoot him if you have to!
          EX catches a PELLET TO THE GROIN, crumples.
          The pellets settle... quiet...P.A. (V.0.)T-minus... Five minutes.
          The engineers start COMING TO, dazed, wondering WHAT THE HELL
          JUST HAPPENED -- Kay and Jay give them a "neuralizer" coverSTORY:JAY(TO CROWD)What the hell is wrong with you
          people? Raquel Welch comes by for

          As one car cuts through them GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY, parting
          the waters -- it's a military jeep -- THE COLONEL at the

          one big step for the rest of you...
          Wait, that's not it. Did that

          a big fan. (Especially of the
          haircut.)JAYBut we've got some bigger fish to
          fry. Hand over the flight suits.
          They start pulling the astronauts off the truck.
          The astronauts protest.JAY (CONT'D)Let's go, people. Why don't you
          take one giant leap out of there.95.They look at Jay and Kay... at the Colonel...COLONELThat's right, gentlemen. You need
          to listen to them. We're going to

          They hear something -- they draw weapons --
          And it's Yaz. Still looking like evil incarnate. The guards
          take in this unholy picture...GUARDWHAT THE--YAZI want in.
          The guards look at each other --GUARDShould we radio the Colonel?GUARD (CONT'D)You wanna get yelled at again?
          They wave him by.GUARD (CONT'D)Go ahead.LAUNCH PLATFORMKay loads the Archanans into the capsule., Technicians in

          being out here in the open -- too
          many ways for Yaz to get to you...KAYI'm almost there.
          Kay's got them inside, but having problems with the hatch.KAY (CONT'D)Hey, tech guys -- get back here and
          help me with the door.TECHIt's called-a hatch.KAYWhatever, just get over here.JAYOh, come on -- what's going on?KAYThis door is complicated.JAYOh, for...KAYWhat? It's an Apollo rocket, not a
          Plymouth Valiant, OK? It's
          complicated.
          Jay goes over to help Kay with the door.
          They both fuss and fight over the door.JAYLift it. You have to lift it.KAYNo, I am lifting it. You have to
          hold the lever.97.JAYNo, if I hold the lever, the rubber
          thingie won't... go in the thing
          where the thingie goes...
          Kay notices something in the reflection of the hatch glass.KAYJay... Why do you think a highly
          trained NASA technician would leave
          the back of his suit unzipped?
          They exchange a look that parallels the opening scene in the
          Chinese restaurant...JAYBecause it's about to go down.
          They turn around, draw weapons on the tech -- it's YAZ!NOTE TO READER:Welcome to the good stuff
          From here, we launch into a GIANT SET PIECE that will take us
          up and around the Apollo Rocket...
          As Jay and Kay battle Yaz and Devil Girl in a super-high-
          stakes confrontation to protect the Archanans...

          EARTH to avenge the deaths ofhis brothers --smallpoxand
          bubonic plague.
          The launch clock ticks down -- the action moves around pipes
          breathing fire, the gigantic scaffolding, liquid oxygen
          spewing from the rocket... All on top of a rocket taller than
          a 30-story skyscraper.
          With T-minus 25 seconds to go, Jay and Kay corner Yaz against
          the lunar capsule.BACK TO SCENE:Yaz laughs at Jay and Kay.YAZYou can't stop me! Nothing on
          Earth can stop me!JAYNothing now.
          Yaz raises an eyebrow...98.Jay draws his NOISY CRICKET -- the gun he brought from the
          future.KAYWhat's that?JAYLittle something I brought with me.
          Jay points the gun at Yaz -- but Yaz just LAUGHS --
          As the clock ticks down to T-minus 5... 4...YAZTry it! You wouldn't dare! One
          false shot and you'll rip space and
          time!JAYThat's a chance I'll have to take.
          Jay BLASTS YAZ

          And then it's over...BIG VICTORY MOMENTAs they watch the rocket carry Yaz off...JAYWe did it, partner. I hope you
          remember this when you recruit me --
          you won't give me such a hard time.KAYYou know I will.JAYYeah.99.KAYI guess we'll have to build a
          prison on the moon or something.
          Jay realizes -- grabs Kay --JAYDo a better job this time, OK?
          That needs to be one hell of a
          prison. You don't want that guy
          coming back, or I'm coming back.
          Look, once was enough, OK?
          Jay turns to The Colonel --JAY (CONT'D)Thank you for your help, sir. Hope
          we don't get you fired.COLONELNot too worried about that.JAYCan I ask you -- what did the Lama
          show you in there that made you
          help us? Was it the Earth being
          destroyed?COLONELNo -- it was my son. All grown up.
          As a matter of fact, I'm late to
          see him -- I promised I'd watch the
          launch with him.JAYOh. Thanks. He's a lucky kid.COLONELI'm a lucky dad. Take care.
          Jay offers him a handshake. The officer takes it -- and
          pulls Jay into a hug.JAYOkay...
          The Colonel leaves. Jay and Kay congratulate each other,
          smile over a job well done...
          But then they see the Archanans... And realize...100.KAYWe're sorry we didn't get you home,
          guys. It was the only way to get
          rid of Yaz.JAYBut we'll make sure you're safe
          here. And the next rocket out...LAMAAll is well. You have done well.JAYNo we didn't. You wanted to go
          home...LAMAThere is what we desire and what
          must be... And now our gift to
          you...JAYGift? But we didn't get you home.ARCHANANSThere is the action and there is
          the intention. It is the intention
          we reward.LAMAYou did the right thing. And if
          humans are capable of such
          sacrifice, such friendship...
          perhaps we ARE already home.JAYSo then what's the gift?LAMAYou already have it.
          Jay looks at pong.JAYThis? Pong?LAMAYes. PONG. The Pan-Galactic
          Ordnance Negation Grid. Agent Kay
          will use this technology...JAYTo make the missile defense system.
          You use this to save the world.101.ARCHANANSYes. Don't drop it.
          They take the PONG and drape it around Kay's neck
          The Archanans leave, chanting...ARCHANANS (CONT'D)(CHANTING)Bip... Bip... Bip...
          And it's just Jay and Kay.
          Jay looks at Kay wearing the PONG... just like in the case
          file picture...JAYHey. My watch stopped.
          We see -- a minute to go. Jay looks at the watch. Something
          about it bothers him...KAYC'mon. Let's go watch that bastard
          leave the atmosphere.JAYYeah, I'll catch up with you in a
          second.KAY GETS INTO THE ELEVATORJay hangs back, approaches the Archanans, walks them down the
          scaffolding.JAYSo you guys understand all this
          time stuff, right? So is
          everything going to be okay now? I
          mean, if I saved everything, and
          Yaz is really gone, why am I even
          here? Shouldn't I not have come in
          the first place? And why do I
          still have time left on my watch?UNDERGROUNDThe scaffolding leads Jay and the Archanans into the maze of
          underground hallways.
          Jay walks, looking at his watch, thinking...102.,He sees a WALL CLOCK -- 3:59.JAY3:59. But Kay didn't get killed
          until...
          And then the AWFUL REALIZATION --JAY (CONT'D)He didn't come yet! Kay, he didn't
          come yet!!!
          Jay races to find Kay.WITH KAYUnaware that his appointment with death is near...WITH YAZ AND DEVIL GIRLRacing down a hallway... hunting Kay...WITH JAYRunning... running... searching... where is Kay?INTERCUT BETWEEN KAY... YAZ... JAY...All converging on destiny...WITH JAYRunning... more frantic now...
          And then he sees him!
          Kay -- at the end of the hallway!. Backlit by the door to
          the outside...JAYKay!
          And then Jay sees -- Yazl Already there!
          Jay goes for his weapon, but he doesn't have the shot!
          Yaz pulls his guns...103.Kay turns to see Yaz -- there's no time to react, only to
          know HE'S ABOUT TO DIE!
          Yaz FIRES!!
          But -- THE COLONEL is somehow there instead! He catches the
          bullet for Kay -- his body dematerializes.
          And it gives Jay the split-second he needs to FIRE ON YAZ AND
          KILL HIM, blowing him OUTSIDE -- where he is INCINERATED BY
          LIQUID OXYGEN leftover from the launch.
          They look at each other -- it's over.KAYSee? I knew you had my back.
          Jay hears footsteps. Looks up and sees the SHADOW OF A TALLMAN -- REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO JAY'S OWN SILHOUETTE.As the footsteps approach, the shadow grows smaller,
          shrinking to KID SIZE. It's a boy.KID'S VOICEDad? What's going on?
          The kid steps into the light -- backlit -- but from the shape
          of his head and Jay's reaction, this kid could only be YOUNGJAY.JAYWhere there is death, there will
          always be death. He saved your
          life. He swapped his for yours.
          He saved the world.
          Kay puts a firm hand on Jay --KAYI'll take it from here.
          Kay steps away... but turns back.
          In a replay of the moment from the first movie, Jay tosses
          Kay a modern Neuralizer.JAYLeave me some memories this time,OK?KAYSure, partner. I'll see you
          around.104.JAYYes you will.
          Kay turns back to the boy, takes his hand.
          Jay watches them from a distance:
          Kay takes something off the ground where The Colonel's body
          was -- hands it to the son.KAYHey, look -- your Dad wanted you to
          have this.
          Kay gives the kid a shiny new commemorative Apollo key chain.
          Jay looks in his pocket -- the same key chain, scratched and
          worn.YOUNG JAYWhere is he?KAYYour daddy had to go -- he's part
          of the space program, now. He's

          to the stars, but you'll be just
          fine. I'll keep an eye on you...
          They are silhouetted by the bright light of the Apollo
          launch...
