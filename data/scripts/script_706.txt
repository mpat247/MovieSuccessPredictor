"LITTLE NICKY" -- by Tim Herlihy, Adam Sandler & Steven BrillFADE IN:EXT. SUBURBIA - NIGHTA beautiful late summer night.  Crickets chirping, sprinklers
	sprinkling.

	We PAN across one particular lawn, up one particular tree,
	where we see THE PEEPER (Jon Lovitz) sitting on a limb.  He
	has a bottle of wine, some sandwiches, a Walkman.  Suddenly
	the lights turn on.PEEPER(whispering)
		Showtime!

	We see a young mother walk into the room outside the Peeper's
	window.  She is wearing business attire.PEEPER (CONT'D)Rough day at the office Mrs. Dunleavy?
			(takes bite of sandwich)
		Well you'll feel better once you slip
		off those work clothes and get into some
		sweats.

	The mother sits on the bed and pulls off her shoes, rubbing
	her feet.PEEPER (CONT'D)Oh my G-D, yes!  I wish you would let me
		rub those feet.  Of course I wouldn't
		use my hands.  Heh heh heh heh...

	He sips some wine.

	The mother starts to unbutton her blouse.  She takes it off,
	revealing a nice bra.PEEPER (CONT'D)Looks like Victoria just told me her
		secret.

	The peeper frantically writes in a dirty notebook.  Mouthing
	the words as he goes.PEEPER (CONT'D)Thursday the ninth, eight-thirty p.m.,
		first brassiere sighting...
			(stops writing)
		I will pleasure myself to this image for
		months.  MONTHS I TELL YOU!

	The mother starts to unbutton her pants.  Her young son walks
	in wearing a scouts uniform.PEEPER (CONT'D)Young Scottie Dunleavy.  What
		unfortunate timing.  You mother was just
		getting comfy.

	The son talks to his mother excitedly.PEEPER (CONT'D)Yes, yes, I'm sure you tied many great
		knots today or whatever.  Now get out.

	The son, not going anywhere, sits in a chair.PEEPER (CONT'D)Now what.  This simply won't do.

	The peeper takes out a cell phone and dials.  The son
	answers.SCOTTIEHello?PEEPERHello, Scottie.  Why don't you go
		downstairs like a good boy and let your
		mother freshen up.SCOTTIEWho is this?PEEPERJust a little birdie.  A birdie who
		wants to see if your mother's panties
		match her bra.MOTHEROh my G-D Scottie.  Is there a man up
		our tree?

	The peeper gets nervous.PEEPERTell her no.  Tell her it's just a big
		bird.

	The peeper starts flapping his arms and making bird noises.
	We SEE Scottie with his sling shot.  The mother nods yes.  He
	shoots it.  It hits the peeper square in the head.  He falls
	to the ground with a thud.PEEPER (CONT'D)Mrs. Dunleavy, please come help me.  And
		wear your bikini.

	The peeper looks up.  He sees Scottie pushing a television
	out the window.  It lands on top of the peeper.  He's dead.HARD CUT:INT. HOLE - DAYThe peeper is zooming down a hole, walls of dirt racing by on
	all sides.

	The peeper is falling down, down, down.  The whole way
	screaming like a five-year old girl.PEEPER'S POVWe see the tunnel turn into more of a slide now and the
	peeper races towards the opening which is lit by fire.  HeSCREAMS.EXT. FIRE GATES OF HELLWe see the GATE/WALL OF FLAMES.  We hear screaming.  Wham!
	We see the peeper come flying through the flames and land in
	a heap in a shallow pit of coals.

	Dazed, he stands and we see other people shooting through the
	fire wall at different levels.  (NOTE: All the arrivals
	clothes are now burned & shredded).GATEKEEPER (O.S.)Welcome!

	The peeper looks left to see the GATEKEEPER standing at his
	station greeting the new SOULS with mock cheer.PEEPERAm I in hell?GATEKEEPERWhat do you think?

	A GIANT BIRD appears and bites the peeper's crotch area.  We
	leave the peeper in the pit and tilt up to...MATTE PAINTING HELLMUSIC UP: "RUNNING WITH THE DEVIL" BY VAN HALENThe VAST and insane kingdom of Hell.  A road leads toward it
	like the yellow brick road only with fire and coals.  We see
	the black castle in the distance.  The camera zooms into the
	castle, to one particular window.INT. NICKY'S ROOM - DAYLooks like an American teenager's room - models, a dresser,
	heavy metal posters (tons of OZZY stuff) everywhere (but no
	bed - Devils don't sleep).  Nicky is air guitaring to the
	song.  Over at the stereo, we see the cassette playing titled"NICKY'S MONSTER METAL MIX."The head demon, JIMMY THE DEMON, opens the door, scaring
	NICKY who falls backward into the table, breaking it.NICKY(embarrassed)
		Hey...JIMMY THE DEMONYour father wants to see you and your
		brothers in the throne room.NICKYOkay, but Jimmy, when the house is
		rockin', don't forget the knockin'!INT. BLACK PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAYADRIAN and CASSIUS are playing darts.  They're aiming for
	people's faces that are coming through the wall.CASSIUSI knew it.  He's finally retiring.ADRIANI've been waiting on this day for ten
		thousand years.

	He throws a dart that hits one of the heads in the forehead.HUMAN DARTBOARDAaaah!CASSIUSIf the old man picks me to take over
		Hell, I'll keep the torture going twenty
		four seven.  No breaks.ADRIANWell Dad says it's the breaks that make
		the torture.  You have to let people
		feel a sense of relief.

	Cassius whips a dart which hits one of the HUMAN DARTBOARDS
	in the eye.HUMAN DARTBOARDAaaaaaaaaaaah!ADRIANThen again, the beauty of Dad retiring
		is what he says doesn't matter anymore.

	Cassius pulls out the dart.  The eye comes with it.CASSIUSI'll take that.

	Cassius throws the eye on the ground and stomps it.  THWACK!
	It splatters like a grape.HUMAN DARTBOARDWas that really necessary?

	Nicky enters sheepishly.CASSIUSHey, how's Daddy's little girl doing
		today?NICKYGood, thanks.

	Cassius snaps his fingers in Nicky's face.CASSIUSHey. Hey. Hey.  Wanna mind wrestle?

	Cassius' eyes start glowing red.NICKYActually, I'll take a rain check on0

	Nicky is slammed into a nearby desk as if by an invisible
	force.CASSIUSGot ya!NICKY(picking up his head)
		Yes, you got me...

	Nicky's head slams back down again.CASSIUSGot ya, again!NICKY(picking head up)
		Got me for sure, yes...

	He grabs a lamp off the desk and cracks himself over the
	head.CASSIUSGot ya!  Now here's the big finish...

	Nicky frowns as he finds his own right hand heading for his
	own crotch.NICKYOh no.  Please Cassius...

	Nicky's hand is being possessed.  It gets closer and closer
	until it latches on to Nicky's crotch.NICKY (CONT'D)Aaaaah.

	Cassius concentrates even harder, making Nicky twist his own
	hand.  Nicky screams even louder.  Adrian smiles.  They don't
	notice that DAD, wearing a sweatsuit (and with very small
	devil horns), enters behind them.DADWhat are you boys doing?

	Cassius releases Nicky's hand.NICKYNothing, Dad.  Just re-arranging the
		furniture.DADCassius, didn't I tell you to stay out
		of your brother's mind?CASSIUSI forgot.DADMaybe this will help you remember.

	Dad's eyes flash red and Cassius punches himself hard in the
	nose, sending him back against the wall and down to the
	floor.

	Dad gives Nicky a wink.  Nicky smiles.  Dad has an air of
	confidence and power.DAD (CONT'D)Now everybody sit down.NICKYHey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying
		down my monsters of metal compilation
		tape.  I really think it's a
		masterpiece.DADOkay, kid, we'll listen to it later.

	He leads the boys to the throne area.  We see outside the
	window the peeper staring in sexily.  Dad looks, shakes his
	head.  Just then, THE BIRD appears and attacks him.  Dad
	closes the curtains.

	Nicky, Adrian and Cassius sit on little stools at the foot of
	his throne.  Dad lights a cigarette with his finger, the tip
	of which glows red like a cigarette lighter and looks down at
	his three sons.DAD (CONT'D)My dad, your granddad, Lucifer, was
		thrown out of Heaven by G-d and rules
		here in hell for ten thousand years.
		And after this ten thousand years had
		passed, he decided to abdicate his
		throne...

	Confused, Nicky sheepishly raises his hand.DAD (CONT'D)...to step aside.
			(Nicky lowers his hand)
		...and let me become the ruler of hell.
		This, as some of you might know, is my
		ten thousandth year as Prince of
		Darkness.  So I think the time has come
		to discuss who will succeed me.

	Jimmy the Demon walks in.JIMMY THE DEMONKnock, knock.DADYes, Jimmy.

	He whispers in Dad's ear.DAD (CONT'D)No, no, that's not what I said.  He can
		keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta
		go.JIMMY THE DEMON(turning to leave)
		Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a
		pineapple up Hitler's ass at four
		o'clock.

	Dad nods, and Jimmy shuffles out.  Dad turns his attention
	back to his sons.DADThis was a very difficult decision,
		because I have three wonderful sons.  I
		mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless.
		And Cassius, so strong, so tough.  And
		Nicky, so...so...NICKYDon't worry about coming up with
		anything.  It's cool.DADSuch a sweet boy.  But after much
		thought and careful consideration, I've
		decided that the ruler for the next ten
		thousand years is going to have to
		be...me.CASSIUS AND ADRIAN(dumbfounded)
		What!?NICKYHallelujah.

	They all look at Nicky.NICKY (CONT'D)I mean...tough break.DADThe important thing for the stability of
		our rule is to maintain the balance
		between good and evil.  And I don't
		think any of you are ready for that
		responsibility yet.  You need the wisdom
		that comes only with the passage of
		time.CASSIUSDad!  This is Hoyashit.

	Dad glares.  Cassius goes FLYING BACK.  One of the Human
	Dartboards laughs.  Cassius whips a dart and hits him in the
	tongue.  Jimmy enters and points at his watch.DADRight.  Right.  Send him in.
			(to the boys)
		I'm sorry, boys.  I've got to get back
		to work.

	Nicky, Cassius and Adrian start filing out.  Adrian stops.ADRIANYou sure about this decision, Dad?DADI'm telling you, pal, it's the right
		thing to do.

	HITLER (in a French maid's outfit), is being brought in by
	Jimmy.  They head towards the closet.

	Inside the closet is a crate of pineapples.  Hitler picks out
	a relatively small one.  Dad shakes his head "no."  Dad walks
	over to the closet.  Hitler picks out a really big pineapple.
	Dad nods "yes."  Hitler sadly hands it to Dad.  Jimmy bends
	Hitler over and as Dad raises the fruit...CLOSE ON HITLER'S EYESAs the pineapple's jammed up his ass.HITLERHoly schnit!!EXT. HIGHWAY TO HELL - DAYCassius and Adrian are standing by the road still flowing
	with souls.  Both are pissed.  There's a big, ugly, Bigfoot
	looking MONSTER hanging out with them, kind of nodding along.CASSIUSYou work your ass off for ten thousand
		years, hurting people, helping others
		hurt people, then you get a decision
		like that.ADRIANAnd he's dead serious.CASSIUSIt's just such a slap in the face.

	Adrian turns to the Monster.ADRIANUm, excuse me, we're having a private
		conversation here.CASSIUSYeah, get out of here!  Beat it!

	Cassius insanely snaps his fingers in the Monster's face.
	The Monster shrugs and walks off.ADRIANTwenty-thousand years ago, Grandpa
		Lucifer said, "It is better to rule in
		hell than serve in heaven."  Well, I'm
		getting tired of serving in Hell.  We
		need a place where we can rule.

	Cassius throws a rock at the Monster.  He yelps, then turns
	around, motioning like he's thinking about coming back.
	Cassius sees this and gets enraged.CASSIUSOh you wanna be a big man?  Bring it
		on!! Let's see what you got!

	The Monster, upon further reflection, throws his hands up in
	an "aw phooey" gesture and continues walking away.CASSIUS (CONT'D)That's what I thought!ADRIAN(to Cassius)
		Could you concentrate for five seconds?CASSIUSI am concentrating.  Where can we rule?ADRIANWhat do you think about...Earth?

	Cassius seems to think this isn't a bad idea.ADRIAN (CONT'D)We could create our own hell there.CASSIUSYou saying we go up there and kill
		everyone?ADRIANEventually, Cassius.  But first we
		corrupt as many as we can so that when
		we do destroy them...CASSIUS...their damned souls will be ours.ADRIANIt's our time, brother.

	The two look at each other.  They start running toward the
	fire wall.  Knocking souls out of their way.GATEKEEPERHey, what are you doing?!?

	They get closer to the fire.GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)You can't go through there.  The fire
		flows in, not out.

	They dive through the fire wall.  It FREEZES.GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)You know something?  You guys suck!  You
		really suck!

	Sirens go off.  Dogs start barking.  Lights flash.  And we
	hear the sound of DAMNED SOULS hitting the back of the
	firewall hard.INT. THRONE ROOM - SHORTLY AFTERDad and Nicky are listening to one of Nicky's metal mix
	tapes.  We hear the end of Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb."
	Pause.  Dad exhales.DADNow that was an experience.  "You are
		only coming through in waves."  That
		line blows my mind every time.NICKYDefinitely.DADI don't care what kind of mood you're in
		at the start of that song.  When it's
		over, that mood has been altered.  Wow.
		Great shit.  What's next?NICKYWell, I thought that after messing with
		your head, I'd give you a little kick in
		the keester.

	Hits the tape player.  "Enter Sandman" blasts.DADWho is this, Metal-lick-a?NICKYMetallica, Dad.  Come on.DADI was just playing with you.

	Dad and Nicky dance to the song.INT. THRONE ROOM - LATERCLOSE ON DAD.DADI'm sorry.  After careful consideration,
		I regretfully have to decline.ON PERSON HE'S TALKING TO: DAN MARINO.DANC'mon, man, I'm just asking for one
		Superbowl ring.DADIn exchange for eternal damnation of
		your soul?  You're too nice of a guy for
		me to want to do that to you, Mr.
		Marino.DANYou did it for Namath.DADYeah, but Joe was coming here anyways.
		Just go back to Earth and enjoy your
		records and the Hall of Fame and the
		beautiful family and all that.DANThis is bullshit, man.
			(gets up to leave)
		I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year,
		with or without you!DADNow you're talking.

	Dan exits.NICKYYou're a good devil, Dad.DADAnd I also happen to be a Jets fan.

	Nicky and Dad share a laugh which is interrupted by faint
	sirens.  The Gatekeeper enters in a hurry and falls to his
	knees.GATEKEEPERYour highness, Cassius and Adrian have
		escaped from hell.  They went through
		the fire, and they broke it.  I think
		they took the New York tunnel.  I tried
		to stop them, but they overpowered me,
		sir.DADOh, boy.  Oh boy.  Calm down.  Get off
		your knees.

	The Gatekeeper stands up.GATEKEEPERThanks for being so understanding, your
		worship.  You're the man.  You've always
		been the man.

	Dad's EYES GLOW RED as the Gatekeeper stands up.  Two huge
	boobs grow out of either side of the Gatekeeper's head.  We
	only see them from the front for a second.
	From behind the gatekeeper, we see the boobs but not the
	nipples as he talks to Nicky.GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)(to Nicky)
		I'm lucky to get away with just the head
		boobs, right?NICKYCoulda been much worse.GATEKEEPERThat's what I'm thinkin'...

	Dad is staring off.  He looks shaken.DADThis is bad, Nicky.NICKYHow bad?DADI'm gonna die, Nicky.  If the gates are
		broken, no new souls can get in, which
		means I'll start to deteriorate into
		nothing.

	GRANDPA LUCIFER enters.LUCIFERWhat's with all the whoo-whoo noises?DADEverything's fine, pop.LUCIFERLast time you said that the renaissance
		happened.DADPlease, pop, just go back to your room.LUCIFER(regarding gateskeeper)
		Can I take him with me and have sex with
		his head?DADSure, pop.  Whatever you want.

	The gatekeeper walks towards Lucifer.GATEKEEPEROh, this is gonna be a whole new
		lifestyle for me, isn't it.EXT. GATES OF HELL - SHORTLY AFTERWe see the coals are cooling down on the road and the DAMNED
	SOULS in hell are sneaking off.

	The DEMONS are baffled and don't quite know what to do.

	Dad, Jimmy and Nicky walk to the frozen fire.DAMNED SOULS (O.S.)What's going on?  Where are we?

	We keep HEARING people hit behind the frozen fire with loud
	thuds.JIMMY THE DEMONNothing's getting through that.  The
		fire is solid as a rock.NICKYWe gotta get this bad boy burning again.
		Ideas?DADTo do that Cassius and Adrian have to
		come back through the other way.NICKYSo go get 'em, Dad!DADI'm too weak.  The process has already
		begun.

	Dad holds up his hand.  His pink is hanging by a thread.  We
	see the bigfoot MONSTER grunt disgusted by the sight.NICKYSo go get 'em, Jimmy!JIMMY THE DEMONI'm just a demon, Nicky.  I don't got
		devil blood in me.  I'd last two minutes
		up there with your brothers.NICKYYou're not saying it's up to me?

	The MONSTER puts his hands over his eyes shaking his head as
	if to say, "oh no."NICKY (CONT'D)I've never been to Earth.  I've never
		even slept over at some other dude's
		house!JIMMY THE DEMONYou're the spawn of Satan.  You got it
		in you.DADNicky, the worst thing that could happen
		on Earth is you get killed, in which
		case, boom, you end up back here.NICKYAre you telling me I have to go to Earth
		and kill my brothers?JIMMY THE DEMONNot go.  They left together at the exact
		same time.  They gotta come back
		together at the exact same time.

	Dad takes an ornate flask from his robe.DADHere.  Get them drunk from this.  One
		sip and they'll be trapped inside.  Once
		you've got both of them, you bring the
		flask back through the gate.

	Dad's pinky is hanging.  Jimmy pulls it off and examines it.
	The Monster gags.JIMMY THE DEMONYour ol' man's got less than a week.

	Nicky looks petrified.NICKYNo.  This can't be happening.DADSon, just do your best.

	Nicky looks teary eyed.  The moment is broken by the Monster,
	who runs in and pushes Nicky through the fire.

	Nicky goes through the solid fire wall.  PAUSE.  The Monster
	taps his own wrist and looks at Dad as if to say, "gotta get
	a move on."INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - DAYA SIGN: 42ND ST. GRAND CENTRALPAN DOWN to the darkened bowels of the old station, between
	two tracks, to a putrid puddle.  Nicky breaks through the
	surface, sputtering.  We hear a rumbling in the near
	distance.NICKYOkay. Earth.  The Blue Marble.  This
		doesn't look too bad.

	Nicky sees a fast approaching light, furrows his brow andWHAMMM!EXT. GATES OF HELL - MOMENTS LATERNicky comes shooting through the solid fire wall and lands in
	the coal pit.  His Dad limps back to him.JIMMY THE DEMONYou were gone ten seconds.  What
		happened?NICKYI got hit by a big light that was
		attached to a lot of metal.DADThat's a train, son.  Don't stand in
		front of them.NICKYWell, I guess I'm going to have to take
		a mulligan on this one.DADPlease, Nicky, get back up there.
			(his ear falls off)
		Try to hurry.

	Nicky climbs up and heads back toward the fire wall.INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - DAYNicky makes it back through the hole.  Looks both ways and
	hops out of the hole.  He carefully crosses the tracks and is
	stopped by the sight of a bulldog, BEEFY, on the other side.
	In his mouth is one of those signs car service drivers use to
	identify their passengers at the airport.  On the sign is
	scrawled "NICKY."

	Nicky and Beefy stare at each other a beat.NICKYI'm Nicky.

	Beefy drops the sign from his mouth.BEEFY(voice of Sandy Wernick)
		Hey, terrific!!  Now get off the track
		and come with me, shitstains.INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - PAVILLION - DAYThe throng of commuters making their way through the terminal
	are giving a wide berth to the filthy man who's looking
	around suspiciously, talking to the dog.BEEFYMy name's Beefy.  I'm an old friend of
		your father's.  He's asked me to help
		you out.NICKYI just need to find my brothers and be
		on my way, Beefy.BEEFYIt's not gonna be easy.  Your brothers
		can possess people.  So they probably
		won't look like themselves.  You have to
		be suspicious of everyone.

	Nicky looks at Beefy warily for a beat.NICKYOkay, "bro," this jig is up...
			(pulling out the flask)
		Just get in the bottle.  Just slide
		right on in there.BEEFYIt's not me, moron.NICKYOh.  Sorry.EXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAYA BLIND PREACHER rants outside the entrance.  People put
	money in his pot.PREACHEROh how the Lord loves you.  All his
		children.
			(passerby puts in money)
		He thanks you for your kindness.
			(another woman puts in money)
		God bless, Ma'am.  The Lord loves you...
		The Lord loves you...

	We see Nicky and Beefy walk up from behind.  The PREACHER
	sniffs.PREACHER (CONT'D)The Lord does not love you.  I
		sense...pure evil.
			(thrusts his cross in Nicky's
		   face)
		You make the Lord very nervous.
			(feeling hot)
		I'm burning...ahhh.
			(running away)
		The Devil walks among us!

	He runs off screaming, wildly bumping into people.PREACHER (CONT'D)Oh Lord, save us from Hell's beast!

	He gets off course and runs right into a subway entrance.  He
	disappears.  Beefy turns to Nicky.BEEFYMakin' friends already.NICKY(shivering a little)
		It's freezing up here, Beefy.BEEFYYou're on Earth now, kid.  Gonna have
		the same physical needs and limitations
		a human has.  We'll stop by K-mart.  Get
		you some warm clothes.NICKYI also have this odd pain in my mid
		section.  Kind of a hollow feeling...BEEFYThat pain is hunger.EXT. BENCH - DAYK-mart bag is next to a bench.  PAN UP to see Nicky wearing
	an extra warm SKI OUTFIT.  Sitting next to him on the bench
	is Beefy.  Between them is a big bucket of POPEYE'S FRIED
	CHICKEN.  Nicky takes out a drumstick.NICKYSo far, so good.  Now what?BEEFYPut it in your mouth.

	Nicky puts it in his mouth.  Holds it there.BEEFY (CONT'D)Move your teeth up and down.

	Nicky does.  He chews for a long time.BEEFY (CONT'D)Now you gotta swallow it.  Tilt your
		head back and let the meat slide down
		your throat-hole.

	Nicky does.  He gets a looks of complete joy on his face.NICKYHey...Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!BEEFYIt sure is.  Now eat it up.  You're
		gonna need your energy.NICKYI got energy up the ying-ying.  Let's
		get cracking!

	NICKY stands with a drumstick and jogs off the curb right
	into the path of a moving bus.INT. GATES OF HELL - MOMENTS LATERThe Monster is rubbing the gatekeeper's boobs.  The
	gatekeeper is wearing a modified bra.  He seems to be
	enjoying it.  We hear a THUD.  They look down to see Nicky on
	the ground.  (We didn't see him flying through this time.)

	The Monster and Gatekeeper immediately stop.  Kind of
	embarrassed.GATEKEEPERHey.NICKYThat's a pretty brassiere.GATEKEEPERThanks.NICKYCould you maybe not tell anyone about
		this?GATEKEEPERYou got it.  Could you maybe not tell
		anyone about this?NICKYYou got it.

	Nicky turns and walks toward the firewall.  As soon as his
	back is turned, the monster pantomimes to the Gatekeeper, "I
	love your boobs."  The Gatekeeper gives a flirtatious laugh
	(we don't see him morph back through the wall here.).EXT. VILLAGE STREET - DAYBeefy is walking with him down the street.  Nicky is crazy
	cautious.NICKYFrom now on.  I'm just going to avoid
		all moving metal objects.BEEFYGreat.  Now your father gave me some
		deposit money for a nice pad on the
		Upper East Side.  But I misplaced it.FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO:INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHTBeefy is sitting on a bench/booth at a strip club.  Champagne
	is on the table.  Bills in his mouth.  We see THREE DANCERS
	dancing for him.FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO:EXT. VILLAGE STREETNicky and Beefy.BEEFYSo I found this other joint for you.
		But you're gonna have a roommate.INT. APARTMENT - NIGHTA scruffy, thirtyish buy, TODD (Allen Covert), is on the
	phone in his small, bohemian apartment in the Village.TODD(on phone)
		I know exactly how you feel... The night
		Reagan was elected, I said to my mother,
		"Is this man going to blow up the world,
		Mommy?"  Then we both cried for like an
		hour.
			(knock at the door)
		Somebody's here.  Call you later.

	Todd gets up and opens the door.  It's Nicky, with Beefy by
	his side.  Nicky is nervous, and his speech sounds practiced.NICKYHello, friend, my name is Nicky.  I
		understand you're seeking a roommate, as
		per your advertisement in the Village
		Voice.  Would it be possible for me to
		fill the slot?TODDUh, don't you want to know what the rent
		is?

	Nicky looks down at Beefy.  Beefy looks up at Nicky.  Both

	gins his homily.CARDINALIn today's gospel, the Lord tells us who
		we are to live if we wish to attain the
		splendor of Heaven... or something like
		that.  Jesus sure says a lot of stuff in

		Abraham hit me with a whiffle ball bat.

	The crowd stares dumbfounded.  We see that the Cardinal is
	standing on a steaming hot pizza which is still in the box
	with the top open.CARDINAL (CONT'D)Yep, the Lord sure did say a bunch of
		hibbity-jibbity.  But has he ever really
		done anything for us?  Has he ever put a
		Jaguar XJR in my driveway?  Has he ever

	A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN stands up.MIDDLE-AGED WOMANThe Lord gave my son the strength to get

		wife conceive a baby.  He helped her
		conceive it all night long.

	Fitzie, who's sitting on the other side of the Wife, starts
	to "raise the roof."  Then thinks better of it.  The Cardinal
	points to a well-dressed man in the front pew.CARDINAL (CONT'D)How about you, Mr. Mayor?  The Lord ever
		do anything for you?

	The Mayor has tinfoil on his feet.MAYOR(standing)
		Well, I wish I could think of something,
		Cardinal, but to be honest with you, I
		can't.  Kind of makes you wonder if
		there even is a Lord.  If there is any
		ultimate punishment for our so-called
		"sins."  Maybe we should all just have
		fun and do whatever the hell we want.

	A hubbub is raised by the crowd.  Fitzie raises the roof
	again, this time energetically.CARDINALAmen to that.  Let the sin begin!

	The hubbub grows to a roar.  Several PEOPLE start fighting
	over the money in the collection plate.

	The Cardinal smiles knowingly at the Mayor.  We hear the
	Cardinal's thoughts - in Adrian's voice.ADRIAN (O.S.)Oh, this is delicious.ON MAYORHe's smirking.  WE HEAR his telepathic response.CASSIUS (O.S.)(laughing)

	Adrian pulls his head back, his tongue is huge and he turns
	into a GIANT BAT.  He lets out a huge roar, then flies
	around, laughing, scaring people.

	Valerie runs over and picks up the flask.  She looks inside.VALERIE(whispering)
		Nicky. Nicky.

	No response.VALERIE (CONT'D)You gotta fly out...I know you can do

	A long beat, then:NICKY (O.S.)Butterflies...

	And Nicky shoots right out of the top of the flask and lands
	on his feet.  Adrian lands and stares down Nicky.  The clock
	is one minute from midnight.

	Adrian swoops down.  Nicky thinks quick and pulls out the
	BALL his Mom gave him and smashes it on the ground.  Out of
	it forms metal G-d: OZZY OSBORNE.OZZYHello, New York.JOHN AND PETEROzzy.

	They faint.

	The Bat's eyes go wide in fear.  Ozzy grabs the bat, his
	mouth grows big, and he bites the bat's head off.  Valerie
	hands Ozzy the flask.VALERIEPut him in, Ozzy.
