               subdivision, facing the curb. It's FALL. Juno is sixteen 
               years old, an artfully bedraggled burnout kid. She winces 
               and shields her eyes from the glare of the sun. The object 
               of her rapt attention is a battered living room set, abandoned 
               curbside by its former owners. There is a fetid-looking 
               leather recliner, a chrome-edged coffee table, and a tasteless

               Mark puts his hands on what remains of Juno's waist. She 
               drapes her arms around his neck self-consciously.JUNOOh, okay. Like this.MARKYou've never been to a dance, have

               taste. Nothing looks as though it's been touched. We see the 
               antique ROCKING CHAIR sitting empty.JUNO (V.O.)It ended with a chair.

               We pan past the wall Vanessa had said "needed something." 
               There's a framed note on the wall. It looks like it was 
               handwritten on the back of a Jiffy Lube bill. We see that it 
               says: "Vanessa -- If you're still in, I'm still in. Juno."

               We move to the door and get a view of Vanessa's bedroom. We 
               see her lying in bed with a burp cloth draped over her 
               shoulder, feeding the baby. For the first time ever, Vanessa 
               looks disorganized, unshowered -- and incredibly happy. There 
               are formula bottles on the bedside table and a bassinet pushed 
               close to the bed. Obviously, she hasn't been away from the 
               baby for a single moment.

               The baby reaches up and grabs Vanessa's thumb. Vanessa glows 
               with an expression of pure bliss.EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - DAYIt's a sparkling summer afternoon. Juno wheels her bicycle 
               out of the detached garage. She waves goodbye to Bren, who 
               is playing in the yard with two WEIMARANERS. She looks almost 
               as happy with her dogs as VANESSA looked with her baby.EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - DAYJuno rides her bike aggressively down the street. Her guitar 
               is slung over her shoulder in a gig bag. She's obviously not 
               pregnant anymore. She looks happy, but older.JUNO (V.O.)As boyfriends go, Paulie Bleeker is 
                         totally boss. He is the cheese to my 
                         macaroni. I know people are supposed 
                         to fall in love before they reproduce, 
                         but normalcy's not really our style.

               As she tears recklessly down the street on her bikes, she 
               passes the Dancing Elk TRACK TEAM, still running in 
               outrageously skimpy shorts and bandanas.

               Juno RIDES up to a garage where Bleeker is sitting, tuning 
               his guitar.EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - DAYJuno bikes up to find Bleeker sitting on the stoop. She smiles 
               and takes out her guitar. She sits across from Bleeker and 
               pulls the pick out of the strings.JUNOReady?

               Bleeker nods.

               Juno begins strumming her guitar and playing "Anyone Else 
               But You," by the Moldy Peaches. Bleeker joins in. At first 
               their playing is discordant, but suddenly it works.BLEEKERYou're a part time lover and a 
                         fulltime friend. The monkey on your 
                         back is the latest trend. I don't

                         else but you.JUNOHere is the church and here is the 
                         steeple. We sure are cute for two

                         rage. You want more fans, I want

                         my body's swinging from side to side.

               She and Bleeker exchange glances as they play. They smile 
               ambiguously. Juno leans over and kisses Bleeker on the cheek.
