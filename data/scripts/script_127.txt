BABELWritten byGuillermo Arriaga(April 9, 2005)1   EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- MORNINGDay breaks. Hassan (50) arrives at a solitary house made of
              adobe, in the southern deserts of Morocco, carrying a satchel
              and a large bundle wrapped in cloth.He walks past a corral made out of branches, where several
              goats bleat, and knocks on the front door.2   EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUSAbdullah (40), opens.HASSAN(In Arabic)
                        Good morning Abdullah... I brought
                        you this...He holds up the bundle.3   INT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATERAbdullah's family is inside the house. There is a room, a
              small table and a simple kitchen. Yasira (38) is roasting
              some goat meat assisted by Yamil (16) and Zora (17), her
              daughters.Abdullah and his sons, Yussef (13) and Ahmed (14), are sitting
              on the floor around the small table, looking at a well-
              conserved .270 caliber Winchester 60 rifle.HASSAN(To Abdullah)
                        It's almost new.He takes out several boxes of cartridges from his satchel.HASSAN (CONT'D)Three hundred cartridges...He opens a box and shows them one of the golden bullets.HASSAN (CONT'D)The hunter who gave it to me said
                        you can hit up to three kilometers
                        away.ABDULLAHHow much do you want for everything?HASSANOne thousand dirhams.2.ABDULLAHOne thousand dirhams? I'll give you
                        one thousand and a goat.Abdullah and Hassan exchange a look and Hassan smiles.4   EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- DAYHassan and Abdullah's family are behind the house. Hassan
              stands with the rifle in front of a rock some twenty yards
              away and he turns toward Abdullah.HASSANWith this rifle, your sons will be
                        able to kill plenty of jackals.He aims at the rock and pulls the trigger without holding
              the rifle properly. It is clear that he doesn't know how to
              fire a weapon, and the shot cracks loudly. The rifle kicks
              and hits him roughly in the shoulder. The bullet flies far
              wide of the rock. The women laugh nervously.Rubbing his shoulder, Hassan turns to Abdullah.HASSAN (CONT'D)Let one of your sons shoot.Abdullah looks at his boys and points at the younger one.ABDULLAHLet Yussef shoot.When Hassan is about to hand Yussef the rifle, Ahmed cuts
              him off, upset.AHMEDI want to shoot first.Father and son exchange an angry glance. Hassan, without
              realizing it, turns and gives the rifle to Ahmed. The boy
              grabs the gun: it is heavier than he thought.HASSANLook, load it like this.Hassan opens the chamber, inserts the bullet and then closes
              it. Once it is loaded, he points at the safety.HASSAN (CONT'D)This is the safety. Push it in when
                        you're ready.Ahmed nods. Unsure of himself, he raises the rifle and,
              almost without aiming, fires. The shot kicks up dust far
              from the rock. His sisters laugh.3.HASSAN (CONT'D)If he doesn't hit the jackals, at
                        least he'll scare the shit out of
                        them.Ahmed lowers the rifle. His father grabs it and gives it to
              Yussef enthusiastically.ABDULLAHYour turn.Yussef grabs the rifle and loads it confidently. He lifts
              the rifle with ease and takes his time aiming. He seems
              innately skilled at the maneuver. He shoots and the bullet
              hits just below the rock.Abdullah celebrates the shot and mockingly turns to Hassan.ABDULLAH (CONT'D)Now this kid shoots a hell of a lot
                        better than you.5   EXT. GOAT CORRAL -- LATERYussef takes one of the goats out, ties and ropes it and
              gives it to Hassan. Abdullah supervises. Yasira approaches
              and gives Abdullah a bag.YASIRAYour lunch.Abdullah takes it and turns to his sons.ABDULLAHYou better kill at least three
                        jackals.HASSANAnd make sure no one sees you with
                        the rifle, hide it if you see someone
                        approach you.Ahmed nods.   Abdullah and Hassan go on their way.6   EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- LATERYasira and Yamil are far from the house, cleaning some
              goatskins stretched out on some branches.Ahmed, with the rifle in his hands, opens the corral gate
              and enters to herd them out. He calls his brother.AHMEDYussef, Yussef...4.7    EXT. SIDE WALL, YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUSYussef is squatting on the other side of the house, spying
               through a crack, breathing excitedly.8    INT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUSZora is inside, undressing. She has a long body and her
               cinnamon skin is soft and clean. Every now and then she
               aims a complicit glance at the crack through which Yussef is
               spying.AHMED (O.S.)Yussef...Zora turns around toward where the voice is coming from.9    EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- DAYYussef is still spying.    Ahmed approaches.AHMEDWhat are you doing?Yussef turns around and signals for him to lower his voice.AHMED (CONT'D)I told you not to spy on her again.Yussef pays no attention and keeps spying. Ahmed pulls him
               by the shoulder and makes him lose his balance. Yussef falls
               on his ass.AHMED (CONT'D)I said don't spy on her.Yussef gets up and dusts himself off.YUSSEFWhat the hell do you care?AHMEDCome on, let's go.He turns around and leaves.10   EXT. DESERT -- DAYThe goats graze. Yussef and Ahmed watch them sitting on the
               side of a hill. They look hot and bored. They both throw
               stones at a small rusty can. Yussef throws one and misses.
               Ahmed throws his and does. He draws a line in the ground.AHMEDFive to two.A jackal is stalking the goats.    Yussef spots it.5.YUSSEFThere's a jackal over there.Ahmed raises his head but cannot see it. Yussef points at
               it, but Ahmed still cannot locate it. Yussef despairs.YUSSEF (CONT'D)Over there.Ahmed finally spots it. He loads the rifle, but when he is
               about to aim, the rifle fires. The shot hits amidst the
               goats, lifting up a small cloud of dust.YUSSEF (CONT'D)What are you doing, you idiot?The jackal flees, terrified, while the goats scamper in
               different directions.11   EXT. DESERT -- LATERBoth brothers are sitting under a tree, eating bread and
               drinking water from a goatskin canteen.YUSSEFZora doesn't mind.Ahmed keeps eating without turning to look at his brother.AHMEDShe doesn't, but I do.YUSSEFThis is between her and me.AHMEDYou're both pigs. Next time I'm
                         going to tell my dad.YUSSEFStay out of this.AHMEDIf you want me to stay out of it,
                         don't do it.Yussef gets annoyed, stand up and leaves.12   EXT. DESERT -- DAYThe brothers are sitting apart from each other.   Ahmed guards
               the goats with the rifle on his lap.After a while, Yussef goes to sit behind a large rock. He
               makes sure his brother isn't watching and he pulls his pants
               down to start masturbating.6.When he is at his most concentrated, a shot rings out and
          startles him. He quickly pulls his pants up and another
          shot rings out. Yussef gets up to see what his brother is
          doing.Ahmed is aiming the rifle at a rock some two hundred yards
          away. He fires a third time.Yussef runs up to him.YUSSEFWhat are you doing?Ahmed doesn't pay attention, and focuses on the rock in the
          distance.AHMEDHassan said that it could hit things
                    three kilometers away, but it can't
                    even reach that rock over there.YUSSEFThat's because you don't know how to
                    shoot. Give me the rifle.Ahmed looks at his brother defiantly, then hands the rifle
          over. Yussef aims and fires. The shot echoes through the
          vast desert; the frightened goats scamper a few yards away.AHMEDSee, it can't reach it.YUSSEFGive me another bullet.Yussef aims and fires. The bullet hits the rock and kicks
          up a lot of whitish dust.YUSSEF (CONT'D)See.AHMEDYeah, but that's not three kilometers.Ahmed remains pensive and suddenly starts climbing to the
          top of the hill. Once at the top, he looks around for a
          moment and then calls his brother.AHMED (CONT'D)Yussef, come here.Yussef climbs the slope. Ahmed signals a road that in the
          distance cuts across the great desert plain, and points out
          a traffic sign that indicates a curve ahead.7.AHMED (CONT'D)I bet you the bullet can't hit that
                    far away.Ahmed loads the rifle and aims at the sign.    He fires and
          nothing.AHMED (CONT'D)These fucking bullets aren't any
                    good.YUSSEFYou're not aiming right.Yussef points at a yellow car driving along the road.YUSSEF (CONT'D)What'll you give me if I hit that
                    car?AHMEDI'll shoot.Ahmed reloads. The empty cartridge falls to the ground. He
          fires again - the car keeps going. Yussef asks for the rifle.AHMED (CONT'D)You see?    Nothing happens.YUSSEFLet me shoot.He also drops the used cartridge on the ground, reloads and
          shoots the traffic sign. He fires and nothing.AHMEDI told you.    Hassan's a liar.A bus approaches.    Ahmed points at it.AHMED (CONT'D)Shoot at that one...Yussef loads the rifle parsimoniously, shuts the chamber,
          raises the weapon, aims and fires.The bus drives on.    Ahmed turns to his brother.AHMED (CONT'D)See: nothing.The bus drives on another three hundred yards and suddenly
          stops in the middle of the road.8.13   INT. T.V. ROOM, L.A. HOUSE -- NIGHTAmelia (54), a maternal, Mexican woman with a pleasant face,

                    Once there was a hawk who wanted to
                    fly higher than everyone else. He
                    trained every day and hunted little
                    birds so he could eat them and be
                    strong.MIKEPajaritos?     Little birds?AMELIAOf course, that's what hawks eat.
                    So, one day the hawk flew so, so
                    high that it crashed into an airplane.
                    It fainted and started to fall. And
                    when it was about to hit the ground,
                    all the birds flew toward him and
                    saved him.DEBBIEThey saved him?AMELIAYes, and when the hawk was healthy
                    again he went to talk to the birds
                    and said: I want to thank you for
                    saving me, but I can't change and
                    I'm going to keep hunting you. The
                    little birds answered: we don't care
                    that you hunt us, because that's who
                    you are. But we will always save

               air tables on a dusty terrace. A bus is parked behind them.At a table, on one end of the terrace with views to a cluster
               of mountains, Richard and Susan look through some menus.
               Richard seems at ease in this place. Susan appears to be
               bothered by the dust and otherness.A waiter brings a plate and some cutlery.WAITER(in broken English)
                         You want to order?RICHARDI'll have a chicken cous-cous and a
                         Coke, please.SUSANWhat do you have that doesn't have

                    diet Coke.WAITERWe don't have diet Coke.SUSANThen a regular Coke.The waiter smiles and goes to place the order. Susan takes
          out a small bottle with antibacterial gel, cleans her hands
          and then starts wiping the plate and the cutlery thoroughly.Richard looks at the mountain range through a pair of
          binoculars. He spots a hawk flying over the plains.RICHARDLook, look: a hawk.Richard follows the hawk with his binoculars for a few seconds
          and then puts them down.RICHARD (CONT'D)This country is incredible.Susan remains silent and then turns to look at him.SUSANRichard, why did we come here?RICHARDWhat d'you mean why? I thought you
                    would like it.SUSANReally: why are we here?Richard knows that Susan's answer implies something else.RICHARDTo forget everything, to be alone.Susan, sardonically gestures toward the other tourists with
          her chin.SUSANAlone?Richard sighs in disappointment. The waiter arrives with
          the Cokes and the food, which does not look particularly
          appetizing. He leaves everything on the table and goes.Richard is about to pour his drink when Susan stops him.17.SUSAN (CONT'D)Throw out the ice.RICHARDThe Coke is warm.SUSANYeah, but you don't know what kind
                         of water is in there.She grabs Richard's glass and tosses out the ice. Then she
               does the same thing with hers. They are quiet for a moment.RICHARDWhy can't you ever relax.    You're
                         always stressed.SUSANYou're the one stressing me out.
                         You're why I can't relax.RICHARDYou could if you tried.SUSANTried? Don't you think I tried?RICHARDYou're never going to forgive me,

                         about?RICHARDSusan, please; we didn't come all
                         this way just to argue.Susan gets angry and faces him.SUSANOh, we didn't? Then when are we
                         supposed to "argue"? Or are you
                         planning on running away again?Richard sighs, defeated. They stop speaking and sit looking
               at the mountains.25   EXT. BUS -- MOMENTS LATERThe tourists crowd around to board the bus. Some boys in
               rags approach to sell them trinkets.BOYSStilo...stilo...18.Some of the tourists buy them. They come to Susan, who
               becomes instantly uncomfortable. She gestures with her hand
               to say they have no money, but the kids insist.BOYS (CONT'D)Stilo...stilo...SUSANI don't have any money... I don't
                         have any...Richard takes off his binoculars and gives them to the
               youngest of the boys (7), who receives them with wide eyes.RICHARDHere.SUSANWhat are you doing?Richard just gets in the bus. Susan stares at the boy with
               the binoculars for a moment and then gets in.26   INT. BUS -- LATERSusan sits next to the window, in the middle of the bus.
               She looks hurt and sad. Richard walks over and sits next to
               her.The bus starts. Through the window, Richard can still see
               the boy with the binoculars. He smiles until he sees an older
               boy snatch the binoculars away and push the little boy.The bus drives away, but Richard can't take his eyes off the
               scene. The older boy walks away with the binoculars.27   EXT. DESERT -- DAYThe bus drives down a straight road that divides the desert.28   INT. BUS -- MOMENTS LATERThe bus drives on. Some of the old men sleep. Susan leans

               reconciliation. He holds hers and caresses it.Susan gets comfortable to try to sleep. She closes her eyes
               when suddenly something smashes the window and Susan collapses
               forward.Richard turns to look at the punctured glass and then Susan.RICHARDSusan, what's wrong?19.Susan doesn't answer, limp on her seat.RICHARD (CONT'D)What happened?Richard lifts her up and when he does he sees a thread of
               blood run down her neck. Richard yells at the driver.RICHARD (CONT'D)Stop the bus, stop, my wife's been
                         hurt.29   INT. VOLLEYBALL COURT -- DAYIn an indoor volleyball court with bleachers, several Japanese
               girls play volleyball. They all compete intensely for the
               point. There is excitement, but everything occurs quietly.A player jumps and spikes the ball. Chieko (16), tall,
               beautiful, with strands of hair painted purple, volleys the
               ball back up. It reaches one of her teammates who sets up
               another to spike it.Chieko's team wins the point. The referee, instead of
               whistling, lifts up a red flag.The players congratulate each other silently, in sign
               language. The only sound we can here is the parents' clapping
               as they watch the game from the stands.Chieko's team serves. Again, the game is heated. A rival
               player spikes the ball, and it is barely out of bounds.
               However, the referee, with his red flag, calls the point.Chieko is upset and goes to argue with him.CHIEKO(In sign language)

               down and then takes her away. Despite Chieko's violent
               reaction, everything is still silent. From the bleachers,
               Yasujiro (47), Chieko's father, dressed in a nice suit with
               the tie undone, with a sad pride about him, disapproves of
               his daughter's actions.30   INT. LOCKER ROOM, VOLLEYBALL COURT -- DAYChieko sits on a bench in her underwear. She looks aggravated
               and absorbed in her own thoughts. Her other teammates get
               dressed. Two of them walk past wrapped in towels, freshly
               showered, and stand in front of her. They talk to each other
               in sign language.TEAMMATE 1You shouldn't have lost your temper.

               locker. Her teammate walks over and gets her attention.TEAMMATE 1Why are you in a bad mood?Chieko doesn't answer.    Teammate 2 approaches.TEAMMATE 2She's always in a bad mood because
                         nobody's fucked her yet.She caps this with an obscene gesture that bothers Chieko.CHIEKOI'm gonna fuck your dad to get rid
                         of my mood.Teammate 1 laughs, amused. Teammate 2 gives Chieko a scornful
               look. Chieko smiles sardonically.21.31   INT. YASUJIRO'S CAR -- DAYYasujiro drives while Chieko looks at the swarming Tokyo

                         me.YASUJIROWhy do you want to fight?They don't say anything else.   The traffic is chaotic.YASUJIRO (CONT'D)I miss your mother too.Chieko just looks at him.YASUJIRO (CONT'D)I'm doing what I can, sweetie.They don't say anything else.   The traffic is chaos.32   EXT.

               There is smoke, and people talking everywhere. Chieko moves
               through the crowd. A hostess intercepts her.HOSTESSDo you have a table?Chieko doesn't manage to read her lips. The hostess, smiling,
               awaits an answer. Chieko waits, expectant, for the hostess
               to repeat herself.HOSTESS (CONT'D)Do you have a table?Chieko nods and points at her group of girlfriends, who are
               sitting on the barstools next to the bar.The hostess smiles another stupid smile and lets Chieko by.
               Further off, her friends spot her and make silly faces.Chieko laughs, walks over to them. They are all dressed the
               same: short skirts, tight t-shirts. Some of them have
               piercings in their nose, lips and ears. They all exude
               hormones in their silence.Chieko goes to talk to them in sign language.CHIEKOWhy all the way in the corner?Mitsu, with a good body, not very tall and with violet
               highlights in her hair, points at a pair of tables where a
               group of young men are drinking beer.MITSUBecause of the view.Chieko turns around and stares at one of them wearing a Milan
               jersey. Their eyes meet. Chieko keeps her eyes on him, and
               the boy finally turns away.MITSU (CONT'D)Do you like him?Chieko nods without taking her eyes off him.23.34   INT. EVE'S -- DAYChieko, Mitsu and another of their friends are playing a

               The young man in the Milan jersey approaches Chieko.YOUNG MANHello.Neither Chieko, nor her friends answer. The guy turns to
               look at one of his friends, who signals for him to insist.YOUNG MAN (CONT'D)Can I play with you?Chieko, obviously, cannot hear him. She keeps playing.
               Suddenly, Mitsu notices the young man's presence and taps
               Chieko on the shoulder. Chieko turns around and is surprised.The young man turns to look toward his friends as he speaks.YOUNG MAN (CONT'D)Do you want to come have a drink?Chieko gets frustrated; she cannot read his lips. He stops
               looking at his friends and awaits an answer, but all he sees
               is three silent girls staring at him stupefied.Chieko talks to Mitsu in sign language.CHIEKOTell him I couldn't read his lips.The young man, upon seeing them communicate, is caught off

                         hairy monster.She makes the gesture of sticking her finger up a hole, then
               goes to the toilet, throws her panties in and flushes. She
               turns to look at Mitsu defiantly, who cannot help but laugh.36   INT. EVE'S -- DAYChieko sits on one of the restaurant's benches. Before her
               is a new group of young men. Mitsu and Chieko exchange a

               her pussy.One of the young men seems to notice, and is stunned. Chieko
               smiles and does it again. He watches Chieko again and
               discretely turns to one of his friends to tell him.Chieko turns her back to him and faces the bar.    She looks
               over at Mitsu, who shakes her head, amused.A beeper rings on Chieko's skirt. She picks it up and reads:
               "Don't forget your appointment with the dentist. Papa."She puts the beeper away and turns toward Mitsu.CHIEKOI'll see you later at my place.She mischievously turns toward the table where the young man
               was, and as she gets off the bench she spreads her legs wide
               open, flashing him shamelessly.She struts out.37   EXT. DESERT -- DAYAhmed and Yussef run full speed, herding their goats as they

               sets it in a corner. She gets some pieces of cloth and starts
               to soak them.RICHARDHow long until the ambulance gets
                         here?ANWARAbout an hour and a half. It's coming
                         from Alnif.RICHARDThat much? Isn't there anyone here
                         who could take her?44.Anwar shakes his head.RICHARD (CONT'D)We've got to get her out of here.
                    There's no one to tend to her.ANWARMy brother already called a doctor,

          despair and confusion are evident.ANWAR (CONT'D)Trust my grandmother; she knows a
                    lot about remedies.The grandmother wrings out the rags and puts them on a table.
          She takes some herbs, a fistful of earth from the floor and
          she tosses them into the basin. She stirs it and pulls out
          a clump of mud which she lays out on one of the pieces of
          cloth.Susan looks horrified at the dirt. The grandmother leans
          over her and tries to clean the wound with the other moistened
          rags. Susan resists.ANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER(In Arabic)
                    I have to clean you.ANWAR(To Susan)
                    Miss, my grandmother is going to
                    help you.The grandmother finishes cleaning her with the damp cloths
          and grabs the clump of mud. She tries to put it on the wound,
          but Susan flinches.SUSANNo, not that.ANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER(In Arabic)

               There is a woman with a twelve year-old son listening to a
               walkman and an old couple.The receptionist (50) will not stop talking to the old lady.48.RECEPTIONISTMy niece sells these creams. And
                         just look at my skin now. I'm going
                         to turn fifty-two and look, almost
                         no wrinkles...The woman continues her banal chatter. Chieko observes her
               grotesque mouth. She then looks at the old man's bored face,
               the old woman's feigned interest, the mother's annoyed
               expression, and the boy, who rocks his head to the music.A man walks out and the receptionist gestures at Chieko and
               points toward the door.81   INT. DENTIST'S OFFICE -- DAYThe dentist (47) - tall and, unlike the receptionist, with
               impeccable skin covering his hardened, attractive face -
               examines Chieko's mouth. His face comes very close to hers
               as he looks at her, making her nervous. The fat receptionist
               walks in without knocking.RECEPTIONISTHere are the sterilized drill bits.The dentist looks up at her. She leaves the drill bits on a
               table and leaves. The dentist turns back to Chieko and speaks
               face to face with her so she can read his lips.DENTISTI-think-you-have-two-cavities-in-
                         your-molars.She smiles. The dentist moves closer to Chieko's mouth again;
               she cannot stop looking at him.Suddenly, Chieko licks his cheek. He is surprised, but
               continues his checkup. She licks him again, this time on the
               lips. He pulls away, flustered.DENTIST (CONT'D)What are you doing?She grabs his hand, puts it on her inner thigh and rubs it
               against her pubis.He, confused, tries to pull his hand away, but she prevents
               him from doing so. The scene starts to turn slightly
               grotesque. After a slight struggle, he pulls his hand back.DENTIST (CONT'D)What's the matter with you?She grabs his hand again and, again, pulls it toward her
               pubis. He gets angry and moves back. The fat woman enters
               again without knocking, sees they are agitated and, without
               a word, walks out and closes the door.49.The dentist turns toward Chieko.DENTIST (CONT'D)Get out.She shakes her head. She is excited, anxious, scared,
               fragile. He pulls her by her wrist out of the chair.DENTIST (CONT'D)Get out right now.He walks to the door and opens it. Just before she walks
               out, Chieko draws out a slight smile, which is almost a grin.82   EXT. TOKYO STREETS -- DAYChieko walks down crowded Tokyo streets.   She walks with a
               lost gaze, unsettled.83   EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING, TOKYO -- DAYChieko arrives at an upper class apartment complex. The
               architecture is cutting edge, but impersonal and cold.84   INT. LOBBY, TOKYO APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAYChieko enters the lobby. Beside the doorman are two men
               dressed in suits: Kenji (31) and Hamano (50). The janitor
               gestures at Chieko with his chin. The men walk over toward
               her and cut her off.HAMANOAre you Yasujiro Wataya's daughter?Chieko doesn't manage to read his lips. She is silent. The
               doorman notices the situation, walks out from behind his
               small desk and shouts at the men.DOORMANShe's deaf mute. Face her when you
                           speak so she can read your lips.Kenji and Hamano are disconcerted. Hamano stands squarely
               in front of her and speaks slowly, emphasizing every word.HAMANOAre-you-Yasujiro-Wataya's-daughter?She nods.HAMANO (CONT'D)We-are-sargeants-Kenji-Mamiya-and-
                           Hamano-Kanoo-of-the-Tokyo-police.
                           We-need-to-find-your-father.She pulls out a pen and a piece of paper from her bag.   She
               scrawls a few lines and hands them over.50.Hamano reads it and turns his face toward hers.HAMANO (CONT'D)No, he didn't do anything wrong. We
                         just want to talk to him. Do you
                         know where he is?She shrugs her shoulders. Kenji gives her his card. Upon
               receiving it, Chieko turns to look at him. Their eyes meet
               and she looks down. She then looks up again, blushing.KENJITell him to call us. And don't be
                         scared, we're not going to do anything
                         bad to him.HAMANOThank you.Chieko can't stop staring at Kenji. The two cops leave.    As
               soon as they do, Chieko heads toward the elevator.85   INT. CHIEKO'S APARTMENT -- DAYChieko walks into the apartment. It is a large apartment,
               elegantly furnished. Although decoration is scant, some
               hunting trophies stand out: a scimitar-horned Oryx, sheep,
               and others. There are also photographs of Yasujiro hunting.A wall is dedicated to family photos. Among them is a picture
               of Chieko as a little girl with her father and her mother.Chieko sees a note on the table at the entrance. She puts
               the policeman's card down and picks up a note from her father
               that says: "I waited until five and you didn't make it.
               I've got a meeting and I'll be back late. I left you some
               soup and some chicken for dinner. Kisses. Papa."86   INT. CHIEKO'S ROOM -- DAYChieko sits in front of a mute T.V., channel surfing.   She
               stops at a fashion show, then some cartoons.Suddenly, on a news program, we see the photographs of Ahmed
               and Yussef. Chieko looks at them for a moment and then
               changes the channel. She is watching T.V. when a red bulb,
               set between a yellow bulb and a blue one, starts to light up
               insistently as the doorbell rings.Chieko notices and shuts off the T.V.87   INT. LIVING ROOM, CHIEKO'S APARTMENT -- DAYChieko opens the door and Mitsu walks in. They greet each
               other with a handshake where they end up touching their index
               fingers to each other's hearts.51.MITSUAre you ready?CHIEKOYeah, I'm just going to get my bag.Chieko goes to get her bag. Mitsu sees the policeman's card
               on the entrance table and looks at it. Chieko comes back
               and Mitsu asks her about it in sign language.MITSUThe cops came again?CHIEKOYeah. They hadn't come in nine
                         months. But these were different
                         cops.MITSUDid they come to ask about your
                         mothers' death?CHIEKONo, but they're probably going to
                         ask my dad about the same things.MITSUThey're just not convinced, are they?Chieko shakes her head, remains pensive and then smiles.CHIEKOBelieve it or not, I liked one of
                         the cops.Chieko puts Kenji's card in her purse.MITSUDid you put on some panties?Chieko smiles, lifts up her skirt and exposes her naked pubis.
               Mitsu lifts hers up as well and is also without panties.
               They laugh and leave the apartment.88   EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATERDawn. The desert is a rose plain softly lit by the sun's
               first rays. Yussef and Ahmed are digging a hole with their
               bare hands. Once they're finished, they clean up around the
               hole and mark it with three stones.89   EXT. HIGHWAY, DESERT -- MORNINGAlarid (40), a federal cop, tall, in an impeccable uniform
               with numerous rank badges, stands on the highway examining
               the site of the shot with the old man who was driving.52.In the distance we can see a police checkpoint stopping some
               cars and, after checking them, letting them go.ALARID(To the old man, the
                              entire dialogue in

                         day. The American tried to stop me
                         right here.He stands more or less where Richard tried to stop him.OLD MAN (CONT'D)I was scared. He was covered in
                         blood and I was coming from picking
                         up my grandson from his work.ALARIDWhere was the bus?The old man points some twenty yards behind him.OLD MANOver there.Alarid walks toward where the old man said and looks out at
               the mountains. Some of his men are visible at the tops.
               Alarid talks to them by radio.ALARIDLook further to the right.We can see some men exploring the terrain.ALARID (CONT'D)(To the old man)

               on the earth. One of his men approaches and Alarid signals
               with his hand for him to stop immediately.53.ALARIDStop right there...The man remains motionless. Alarid follows the prints that
               lead away from the cartridges. He reaches the mess of goat
               hoof-prints. He picks up a ball of shit and feels it.ALARID (CONT'D)They're from around here. Find out
                         who has a .270 caliber rifle.91   EXT. DESERT -- MORNINGYussef and Ahmed walk back home, lost in their own thoughts.
               Suddenly a jackal trots out and stares at them. Yussef picks
               up a rock and throws it. The jackal runs off.92   EXT. HASSAN'S HOUSE -- MORNINGHassan and his wife are listening to the radio and playing
               cards at a table placed outside the house. As they play,
               Hassan whittles a stake with a small knife.Hassan's wife lowers her hand and Hassan follows.HASSANI won...His wife pushes two chips from her pile toward him. In the
               distance, several trucks approach, kicking up a dust cloud.
               Hassan's wife gets up to better see them.WIFEAre you expecting anyone?Hassan stands up and watches the vehicles come closer.HASSANNo.Five trucks pull up in a semicircle around the house. A
               dozen police officers get out armed and aim at Hassan and
               his wife.Alarid gets out and stands next to his car door.ALARIDHassan Ibrahim?Hassan paralyzed by fear, answers in a broken voice.HASSANYes.One of the police officers approaches him aiming directly at
               his head, while another one aims at his wife.54.POLICE OFFICERDrop your weapon.Hassan lifts up his knife and shows it to them.HASSANIt's not a weapon, it's my knife.POLICE OFFICERDrop it, now...Hassan drops the knife in the dust.POLICE OFFICER (CONT'D)Get down on the floor... face down...Hassan and his wife look at each other before they obey.HASSANWhat did we do?The cop readies himself to fire, and Hassan drops to the
               ground. His wife follows and also lies on her stomach.93   EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- DAYAbdullah takes two goats out of the corral, ties a rope to
               their neck and drags them over to a rock. The goats bleat
               desperately trying to break free.Abdullah turns to look at his children.ABDULLAHHold them.Yussef and Ahmed hold their legs.   Abdullah pulls out a knife
               and slits the goat's throat.94   EXT. HASSAN'S HOUSE -- DAYHassan lies on the floor, cuffed, with a broken mouth,
               surrounded by cops. Alarid is carrying out the interrogation,
               squatting next to Hassan's face.ALARIDWhy did you shoot at the bus?HASSANI didn't shoot at anyone.ALARIDThen who, you idiot?Hassan remains silent and turns to look at his wife who is
               sitting on a chair, cuffed, a few yards away.55.HASSANIt wasn't me.Alarid punches him in the face.ALARIDThat was your rifle.HASSANNo, not anymore, I sold it today.ALARIDOh yeah?   To who?95   EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- LATERAbdullah gives Yussef and Ahmed some goat skins.ABDULLAHTake these goat skins to Naguib and
                         see if he wants to buy them.The two brothers bundle up the skins, tie them up with some
               cord and they leave down the path away from the house.96   EXT. DESERT -- DAYAs they climb a hill, they encounter a convoy of Moroccan
               police trucks. They are terrified. The vehicles screech to
               a dramatic halt before them, lifting up much dust.Alarid opens the passenger window.ALARIDHey, do you know where Abdullah Adboum
                         lives?Ahmed and Yussef exchange a glance.   Yussef nods.YUSSEFYes.Ahmed gets very nervous.   Yussef points the wrong way with
               an air of certainty.YUSSEF (CONT'D)Over there, you have to cross those
                         mountains.ALARIDThey told us he lived around here.YUSSEFNo, we just live here with our mother.
                         Abdullah lives over there.Alarid scrutinizes the brothers' faces.56.ALARIDIf you're lying to me I'm going to
                         come back and cut your balls off.Ahmed breathes nervously.    Yussef continues in cold blood.YUSSEFYou can come back whenever you like.Alarid smiles and gestures at the driver with his head that
               they should go on. The police vehicles drive off in the
               direction Yussef pointed them in.97   EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- DAYAhmed and Yussef run home. Their mother and sisters are
               milking some goats into a tin bucket. When they fill, Abdullah
               empties the milk out into a barrel.AHMEDPapa... papa...Abdullah puts the bucket down on the floor and turns to look
               at his kids, who stop before him, panting, exhilarated.ABDULLAHWhat happened?Ahmed can barely control his gasping.AHMEDThe police... they're looking for
                         you...ABDULLAHMe?    Why?YUSSEFNo, they're not looking for you...
                         they're looking for us...ABDULLAHYou?    Why?YUSSEFBecause of what happened to the
                         tourist...Yasira and her two daughters stop milking and approach.
               Abdullah can't seem to understand what their talking about.ABDULLAHWhat tourist?AHMEDThe American... Yussef killed her...57.YUSSEFThat's not true, we both did.YASIRAWhat are you saying?Ahmed fires his words out.AHMEDYussef started shooting at the cars

                four drags and slowly starts to relax.Susan smokes another three times, relaxes and closes her
                eyes. The old woman goes to get the clump of mud and starts

                          hour...Richard breathes, relieved.122   EXT. STREET, TOKYO -- DAYChieko walks down the street with Mitsu. They are good-
                looking and attract attention. They know this and look back
                out of the corners of their eyes.123   EXT. PARK, TOKYO -- DAYThey arrive at a park with a playground: swings, see-saws,
                slides. Several of their deaf-mute volleyball friends are
                there.With them are two young men with hair dyed blond. One of
                them, Takeshi (18), has an earring, and the other, Haruki
                (19), has several tattoos.Mitsu and Chieko greet them in sign language.    Chieko asks
                the slightly chubby Kumiko who they are.KUMIKOThey're my cousins.Chieko turns to look at them, curious. Haruki, the guy with
                tattoos, exchanges a look with her. Chieko suddenly feels
                intimidated and looks down.CHIEKOIs he deaf-mute like us?KUMIKONo, but he understands some.Haruki seems to understand what they're saying and leans in
                to whisper something to Takeshi, his brother. They both
                laugh.Haruki approaches Chieko and talks to her face to face so
                she can read his lips.72.HARUKIWhat's your name?Chieko and her friend smile.    Chieko takes out her notebook
                and pen and writes her name.    Haruki reads it out loud.HARUKI (CONT'D)Chieko?Chieko nods.HARUKI (CONT'D)My name's Haruki.Chieko nods, trying to show she's understood. Haruki takes
                out a flask and holds it out to her. Chieko opens it and
                smells it. Haruki stands in front of her.HARUKI (CONT'D)It's whisky.Chieko smiles and gives a long swig.       Mitsu asks for some
                and also gives it a long drink.HARUKI (CONT'D)Do the cops come around here?MITSU(Gutturally)
                          Sometimes.Haruki takes out some ecstasy and gives it to them. Mitsu
                and Chieko look at each other and down the pills with a gulp
                of whisky.124   EXT. PARK, TOKYO -- LATERHalf-drunk and rushing from the pills, Chieko, her friends,
                and Haruki and Takeshi, play on the swings and see-saw.
                They laugh at almost anything. Haruki and Chieko are on the
                see-saw and every time Chieko rises, Haruki looks at her
                bush. Chieko knows this sometimes opens her legs even more
                so he can look to his heart's content. Hormones float in
                the air.Mitsu also takes advantage of the occasion. She flirts with
                Haruki whenever she can. Haruki looks happy to be the object
                of their attention.Takeshi, who has started to make out with one of Chieko's
                friends, turns to the group and speaks slowly.TAKESHIWhy- don't- we- go- to- Montana?73.125   INT. TAXI, TOKYO -- EVENINGNight begins to fall. Haruki sits between Mitsu and Chieko.
                He strokes Chieko's knee with his hand; she seems turned on.126   EXT. NIGHTCLUB STRIP, TOKYO -- NIGHTThe taxi parks outside the Montana. Chieko, Mitsu and Haruki
                get out of the car and meet with the others at the door.127   INT. HALLWAY, NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHTThey enter. The music, the light, the crowd, it is almost
                hallucinatory. For Chieko, it is a silent concert of movement
                and chaos.She and her friends push their way through the place. Haruki
                grabs Chieko by the hand, pulls her toward the floor and
                starts dancing. Chieko looks at the other dancers' rhythm
                and follows. She slowly manages to follow.The other deaf-mutes also dance. Some do better than others,
                lost in the sea of lights and people.For Chieko, the dance turns into something hypnotic. She
                dances with her eyes closed, concentrated on her own rhythm.When she opens her eyes, she sees that Mitsu, a little drunk,
                is grinding against Haruki, feeling him up.Chieko seems annoyed by this and goes to defend her territory.
                She starts dancing next to Haruki, but she is constantly
                interrupted by the surrounding crowd.The struggle between Chieko and Mitsu is a little bit
                ridiculous. It is finally resolved when Mitsu takes Haruki
                by the face and starts to kiss him. Chieko doesn't know what
                to do. Mitsu and Haruki start to make out intensely.Suddenly Chieko is left standing in the middle of the club,
                motionless, while her friends dance awkwardly and Mitsu and
                Haruki are having the time of their lives. Chieko, defeated
                by her friend, decides to leave. Mitsu spots her out of the
                corner of her eye and waves goodbye. Chieko smiles back and
                walks away from her friends as they dance.128   INT. LOBBY, TOKYO APARTMENT BUILDING -- NIGHTChieko enters her building and goes straight to the doorman.DOORMANGood evening, how may I help you?Chieko takes out a piece of paper and a pen from her purse
                and writes a note. She gives it to the doorman together
                with Kenji's card. He reads it carefully, and when he's
                done he turns to her.74.DOORMAN (CONT'D)Very well miss, I'll call him now.The doorman picks up a cordless phone and dials.DOORMAN (CONT'D)Lieutenant Kenji Mamiya, please?There is a pause. The doorman gestures to Chieko that the
                lieutenant will answer in a moment.DOORMAN (CONT'D)Lieutenant? Yes, look, I'm with the
                          deaf-mute girl you saw in the
                          afternoon, and she asked me to call
                          you... Yes, her... She says she needs
                          to talk to you, alone... about her

                          apartment, tonight.Chieko watches attentively.129   EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- DAYYussef and Ahmed are sitting against the wall of the house.
                Yussef's lip is split. Ahmed's nose is bleeding.Abdullah paces desperately, while his wife and daughters
                watch the scene, silent. Abdullah stops to look at Yussef.ABDULLAHWhy did you do this?They don't answer.   Abdullah leans over and slaps Ahmed.ABDULLAH (CONT'D)Answer me, god damn it!Ahmed won't answer and he turns to Yussef again.YUSSEFWe were testing the rifle.Abdullah turns and gives Yussef a powerful slap, which he
                endures with silent dignity.ABDULLAHAre you idiots? You killed a woman,
                              (He turns to Zora)

                Zora. He looks furious, scared, indignant.ABDULLAH (CONT'D)Why did you do this to us?He can barely hold in his tears. Zora brings her hand to
                her face tearily. Abdullah turns to Ahmed.ABDULLAH (CONT'D)Where's the rifle?130   EXT. HASSAN'S HOUSE -- DAYA cop interrogates Hassan. His face is badly bruised and
                his hands are cuffed behind his back.COPWhat organization gave you the weapon?HASSANI've told you it wasn't an
                          organization; I got it from a hunter.COPWhat hunter?HASSANA Japanese hunter gave it to me many

                          She can get it.He turns to look at his wife. She has also been beaten and
                is guarded by two cops. The interrogating cop authorizes
                her. She walks in and comes out with a photograph of Hassan
                with Yasujiro, posing with the scimitar-horned oryx. He hands
                it over and the cop examines it.HASSAN (CONT'D)He's holding the rifle he gave me.131   EXT. DESERT -- DAYYussef and Ahmed dig up the rifle and the bullets in front

                and Ahmed. The women watch them get lost on the horizon.132   EXT. HASSAN'S HOUSE -- DAYAlarid's truck parks in front of Hassan's house again. Hassan
                is still cuffed and being interrogated. Furious, Alarid gets

                ring out.YUSSEF (CONT'D)They're shooting at us.Abdullah stands before his sons and lifts up the rifle as a
                sign of surrender. The shots cease for a few seconds, but
                they suddenly start again.ABDULLAHGet down.   Run.The three shepherds run, huddling as low as they can. More
                shots. They desperately climb between the rocks. Bullets
                whiz past everywhere.Abdullah makes one last attempt at surrender. He lifts up
                the rifle again, sets it on the ground and backs away. But
                the gesture is in vain, as the bullets still rush past.They begin to run again when Ahmed is hit in one of his
                calves. He collapses and rolls downhill. Abdullah hurries
                to rescue him and drags him behind a rock.Ahmed won't stop screaming from the pain.AHMEDThey shot me, they shot me...78.Yussef dives on his belly and snakes his way through the

                considerate.KENJI (CONT'D)I'm sorry. Is there something you
                            wanted to tell me?Chieko nods and asks him in with her hand. Kenji takes off

                the apartment. Chieko comes back from the kitchen holding a
                strange gadget which she puts on the living room table. A
                small bulb lights. Kenji just watches her.Chieko gestures for him to sit down.     Kenji and Chieko sit
                across from each other.95.Chieko takes out her notebook and pen, writes something down

                          off the balcony?She nods. She gets up, asks Kenji to go with her and walks

                piece of paper.KENJIYou saw her jump?She nods and writes again.    She looks perturbed.KENJI (CONT'D)You've already told the other

                her notebook "Then why do you want to talk to my father?"
                Kenji reads and then turns to her.KENJI (CONT'D)It's about a hunting rifle in his
                          name.The red bulb on the gadget starts to blink. Chieko spots it
                from the balcony and signals to Kenji that she has to go to

                    we want to talk to him.The news weighs on Chieko; she looks away. The sounds of
          Tokyo come in through the living room: its car horns, its
          voices.Suddenly a rush of wind comes in. Chieko sees the balcony
          doors are open and goes to close them. She then comes back
          to the living room and sits down, dejected.Kenji sits down beside her and leaves the tea on the table.
          He doesn't know what to do and looks uncomfortable.She picks up the notebook and writes.    Kenji reads.KENJI (CONT'D)No, your father isn't going to jail.
                    We just need to talk to him.There is a long silence. Chieko seems immersed in a remote,
          inaccessible world. Kenji turns his face to hers so that
          she can read his lips.KENJI (CONT'D)I have to go now. Thank you.Chieko grabs his arm and shakes her head, urging him to stay.
          They exchange a look for an instant and Kenji insists.KENJI (CONT'D)I have to go.He gets up to leave. Chieko signals for him to wait for a
          moment and goes to her room.Kenji stands in the middle of the room, waiting.    Chieko
          comes back completely naked. Her skin bristles.She walks toward him, breathing through her mouth. Kenji is
          disconcerted when he sees the quiet teenager approach. She
          walks all the way up to Kenji and when she is about to take
          another step, he holds her back with both hands.KENJI (CONT'D)What are you doing?97.She doesn't pay attention, breaks free and stands a few inches
                away from him. She is almost panting. She holds out her
                hand and caresses Kenji's ear. He stands there, immobile,
                without taking his eyes off Chieko's.She takes his hand and puts it on one of her breasts. Kenji
                strokes her breast and then pulls his hand away. She grabs
                it again and puts it back on.KENJI (CONT'D)No, no, no... this is wrong.Kenji looks turned on and confused: Chieko is beautiful, but
                he knows he cannot go on and takes his hand away.KENJI (CONT'D)No, I can't.     You're just a girl.She walks up to his face and licks it.    He is confused.KENJI (CONT'D)Enough, please.He grabs her by her arms and moves her away. She grabs the
                sleeve of his jacket and pulls him back. She hugs him and
                suddenly Chieko starts crying, disconsolate.Kenji, bewildered, first does nothing, but upon seeing
                Chieko's despair, holds her. She buries her face in his
                shoulder. Her nakedness becomes increasingly fragile.165   EXT. DESERT -- DAYAbdullah, afraid, watches his son shoot. The police have
                stopped firing and run for cover. Yussef loads the rifle
                again and aims carefully. He shoots and, in the distance,
                we can see one of the headlights on a police truck shatter.Abdullah shouts at Yussef desperately.ABDULLAHYussef, stop shooting!Furious, Yussef loads the rifle again and starts shooting at
                the cops. Ahmed won't stop screaming from the pain. Confused,
                Abdullah doesn't know if he should console his wounded son
                or stop the enraged Yussef.In the distance, the cops reorganize.    We hear the faraway
                shots of Alarid giving orders.ALARIDMove that truck... god damn it...One of the cops gets onto a truck and uses it as a parapet.
                Yussef aims again, but this time the policemen are well
                covered. Abdullah drags himself all the way to Yussef.98.ABDULLAHGive me that rifle...Yussef turns to his father.YUSSEFThey're going to kill us.ABDULLAHGive me that rifle.He tries to wrest it away, but Yussef resists. The struggle
          and Abdullah finally pulls it away. When Yussef tries to
          snatch it back, the police fire a round of shots and the two
          barely have time to hide.The air is thick with gunshots. Yussef and Abdullah,
          terrified, stick to the stones. The bullets strike very
          close to them, and they can't even raise their heads.Ahmed won't stop complaining.    Abdullah shouts at him.ABDULLAH (CONT'D)Ahmed, don't move.The gunshots rain down for over a minute. When they stop,
          Abdullah turns to look at Ahmed, who is lying motionless on
          the rocks with bullet in his back.ABDULLAH (CONT'D)Ahmed!   Ahmed!Oblivious of the police, he gets up and runs toward him.
          Motionless, Ahmed just moans. With every breath, his shirt
          grows bloodier.ABDULLAH (CONT'D)Ahmed!   Ahmed!He rolls Ahmed over and lays his head on his lap. Abdullah
          cannot stop crying. Yussef, ducking, runs toward his brother.
          Abdullah laments nervously.ABDULLAH (CONT'D)Don't die, don't die.Yussef is shocked upon seeing his dead brother. He stands
          up and, without caring whether anyone fires at him or not,
          he raises the rifle up in the air for the police to see that
          he is not aiming, and starts to break it against the rocks.When he's finished breaking it he opens his arms and walks
          toward the police. One of them policemen looks at him through
          a pair of binoculars. Alarid interrogates him.ALARIDWhat's happening?99.POLICE OFFICERA boy is walking this way.ALARIDIs he armed?The officer takes a careful look.POLICE OFFICERIt doesn't look like it.ALARIDWhat are the others doing?The officer watches Abdullah carrying his wounded son.POLICE OFFICERA man is holding somebody injured.ALARIDIs the other one still walking this
                    way?POLICE OFFICERYes.Alarid turns to the other officers.ALARIDAim.The police aim and hold Yussef in their sights. He keeps
          walking resolutely toward his aggressors. He is crying
          softly, keeping his arms open.Yussef walks until his is 10 meters away from the police and
          he kneels with his arms open.YUSSEFI killed the American, I was the
                    only one who shot at you...Cautious, the police still aim at his chest. Yussef proceeds
          with his confession, babbling it through his nerves, his
          pain and his attempt to control his sobbing.YUSSEF (CONT'D)They did nothing... nothing...He turns to his father and his brother and points at them.YUSSEF (CONT'D)Kill me, but save my brother, he did
                    nothing... nothing...Alarid moves in, aiming at him with a rifle.    Behind him are
          five other cops, also ready to shoot.100.ALARIDOn the ground...Yussef does not obey.YUSSEFSave my brother...ALARIDOn the ground...Yussef turns his face toward Alarid looks him in the eye.YUSSEFSave my brother... please...He lies on the floor, crying. Alarid puts his gun down and
                looks at him: his enemy is a disconsolate child. Then he
                looks up at Abdullah who is screaming his lamentations. He
                turns to one of his subordinates.ALARIDGo help them.One of the officers goes to help Abdullah and Ahmed.     Yussef
                lies on the floor, crying.166   EXT. DESERT -- NIGHTThe sun rises.   Amelia and the children keep walking.    They

                deeply. There is a noise and Amelia opens her eyes. She

          The other one cuts diagonally across its path and then gets

          place, wearing her best clothes torn by the bramble. She
          makes sure the trucks are leaving.MIKEWhy are we hiding if we didn't do

                and her breath is irregular: she is visibly dehydrated.Upon seeing that she doesn't react, Amelia looks for the
                trucks: they're far away.170   EXT. DESERT -- LATERAmelia carries Debbie in her arms under the burning sun,
                following a cattle trail. Mike walk behind, pale, sweaty.

                remote world of her silence. Before her, Kenji observes her
                nakedness, her sadness, her pained beauty.For a while they remain motionless. She seems to return
                from the long journey to herself and turns to look at him.
                Their eyes meet. There are still tears in Chieko's eyes.
                They hold each other's gaze until Chieko gets up, gets her
                notebook, scribbles down some words and gives them to him.Kenji reads them and looks at her.KENJIYou don't have to apologize for
                          anything.She sits down beside him. They look at each other again for
                a few, long seconds. Chieko takes his hand, strokes it for a
                moment, kisses it, sucks one of his fingers and then puts it
                back in its place.She grabs her notebook and starts writing a long note. It
                takes her almost a minute to do so. Kenji, nervous because
                of her proximity, watches her write feverishly.Chieko finishes writing, folds the note and hands it to Kenji.
                Kenji starts unfolding it, but Chieko stops him. She takes
                it away from him, folds it again and puts it in his breast
                pocket. She signals for him to read it later.Kenji gets up to go. She stands next to him. Her nakedness
                contrasts with Kenji's toughness. He bows his head to say
                goodbye and she moves aside for him to pass. Kenji walks
                past her as she watches.Kenji reaches the door. He opens it and turns to look at
                Chieko again, who has been left in the middle of the hall.
                He bows his head again and leaves.Chieko watches him leave and closes her eyes painfully.196   INT. ELEVATOR, CHIEKO'S BUILDING -- NIGHTKenji rides the elevator down, touched, barely able to contain
