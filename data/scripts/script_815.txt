    revisions byMark SteilenREVISED SECOND DRAFTFebruary 27, 2003FADE IN:EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAWNCLOSE ON the anxious, sweating, frightened face of DREW
MacLEOD, 17, running to save her life. Think Dustin
Hoffman in Marathon Man -- someone, something -- is after
her but UNSEEN.
She glances fearfully behind at her mysterious pursuer,
her BREATHING becoming more labored.
Cutting through a deserted park, she leaps a bench.
Above her, the thin morning sun has only begun to lighten
the leaves.
Around the corner, she's back on a sidewalk lined with
beautiful homes, all quiet at dawn, the only noise her
racing FOOTSTEPS and quickening BREATHS.DREW'S POV - HER OWN FRONT DOORand safety loom half a block down. She pours on the
effort, hurdles a hedge, jumps the stairs and makes the
door, rips it open, bolts inside and SLAMS it shut.ANGLE ON THE SHRUBwhere, with the CAMERA AT GROUND LEVEL, a GOLDEN
RETRIEVER PUPPY, unable to leap the hedge, PLOWS INTO IT
HEADFIRST and disappears. YELP!

INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Drew, wheezing from the exertion, pulls an ASTHMA INHALER
from her pocket, takes a hit, then peeks out the window
in the front door and sees...DREW'S POVThe puppy squeezes through the hedge, wiggling its bum to
extricate itself. A SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL picks it up, hugs
it close:SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRLWhere are you going, Jelly Bean?CUT TO:2.INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - PARKER'S ROOM - MORNING
CLOSE ON A JAPANESE EXECUTIVE (with a CLOCK in his belly)
which suddenly begins SCREAMING IN JAPANESE, ITS JAWWAGGING.From under piles of clothes and sheets, PARKER MacLEOD,
17, Drew's twin sister, opens one eye, shuts OFF the
shrieking ALARM CLOCK.
With a SIGH, she throws her feet  over the edge of the
bed. Her room is a train wreck.    Grabbing a MatchBox 20
T-shirt from the pile on the bed,  she gives it a sniff.
Good enough. Pulling it on, she   pauses, looks a bit
concerned down at her navel.
A recent belly-button piercing looks a little red. She
touches it. Ouch. When a RINGING is heard, she begins
tossing clothes, blankets, shoes, trying to unearth the
source.
She pulls her BLACKBERRY from under the covers:THOREAU 786:   MADE CRITICAL ERROR LAST P.M.Parker snickers, types her return from...NOTATWIN:   CONFESSTHOREAU 786:   DROPPED TRIPLE DEPTH CHARGE AFTER DINNER.NOTATWIN:   THAT MUCH CAFFEINE IS ILLEGAL IN UTAH.THOREAU 786: THEN BOUGHT 'NO MONEY DOWN' REAL ESTATECOURSE AROUND 3:00 A.M.This makes her smile.NOTATWIN:   A CAREER MAN.   I LIKE THAT.CUT TO:INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING
Drew stands before the mirror, perfecting perfection. In
a tasteful suit, hair just so, she opens the drawer...
... which is hyper-organized, everything in a little
labeled nook. She pulls out tweezers and we see beneath
where it says, "tweezers."
She leans into the mirror very close, spots a stray
eyebrow hair, plucks it. Pulling back, she raises her
other eyebrow. Huh. Now they're not even.(CONTINUED)3.CONTINUED:She leans in again and plucks one from the other eyebrow.
Uh-oh. This is like when your mom cuts your hair and
keeps cutting to get it even until you're shaved. She
reaches for the other side... but suddenly catches
herself and stops. Deep breath. Let's not get too
psychotic.
She dunks the tweezers in the alcohol jar, then replaces
them.
Checking her teeth, she spots a stuck bit.       Grabbing her
WATER PICK she begins cleaning her teeth.PARKER (O.S.)Morning.
Startled, Drew shoots herself in the eye with the water
pick. Parker's ENTERED from her side. Drew shuts off
the water pick, dries her face.PARKERWhy the young executive look?DREWI have my interview at NYU today.
Parker, sleepy, stretches, unaware she's exposing her new
belly ring.DREWNo way Mom knows about that.
Self-consciously, Parker drops her arms, pulls her shirt
down.PARKERAnd she never will. At least
             until after I'm married.DREWDidn't it hurt?PARKERLike hell.
Drew shivers.DREWPiercings are so... unhygienic.
A little BEEP BEEP from her preset WATCH ALARM goes off.(CONTINUED)4.CONTINUED:DREWBreakfast.
Drew turns on her heel and EXITS. When Parker sets her
Blackberry down we get our first glimpse of...
... HER SIDE OF THE    BATHROOM which resembles a post-
apocalyptic toiletry    landscape. There's a very clear
line of demarcation    on the counter like the demilitarized
zone separating the    Koreas.
Parker reaches among the rubble for her toothbrush but
notices another message on her Blackberry:THOREAU 786:     KNOW WHAT TODAY IS?NOTATWIN:     ANOTHER DAY IN HELL?THOREAU 786:     TWO WEEKS SINCE OUR FIRST CHAT.NOTATWIN:     OUR ANNIVERSARY.    HOW SWEET.THOREAU 786: SINCE IT'S A SPECIAL OCCASION, MY REALNAME'S WARREN COLLIER. IF YOU'RE EVER IN THE CITY, I'DLOVE TO MEET. GOTTA GO.Accompanying the text, a PICTURE Warren has sent finishes
downloading -- eighteenish, the shaggy chic, Calvin Klein
model-type.PARKER(suddenly wide-awake)
             Hellooo, Warren.
Distracted, Parker drops her toothbrush, which bounces
off the counter and PLOPS into the toilet.
ON THE TOILET BOWL -- there it is, slowly sinking.
Parker is stone-faced. She looks to her sister's side of
the counter where a fresh brush sits in the flowered
holder. She's considering... she's reaching... then...
nah.
Instead, she squeezes the tube straight into her mouth,
brushes with a finger and spits.

INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
Drew's seated, napkin on lap, eating granola and studying
her open DAYBOOK.(CONTINUED)5.CONTINUED:DR. QUINN MacLEOD, dressed professionally and obviously
together even at this hour, pours coffee for herself and
her husband, PROFESSOR CHARLEY MacLEOD, who ENTERS still
in his ratty old bathrobe and outrageous bed-head.
As a matter of routine, Quinn holds out his cup and he
takes it, kisses her and sits down to the paper.DREWMorning, Dad.CHARLEYMorning, baby.DREWHow's the book coming?CHARLEY(sigh)
             Well, sweety, my writing process
             is a lot like a giant
             hydroelectric dam. For a long
             time I just let the great ideas
             build up and build up until the
             sheer weight of them spills over
             and the words just come pouring
             out.DREWStill stuck, huh?CHARLEYNot a word.
Parker ENTERS with her Blackberry in hand, smooches her
pop, then takes a sat.
Parker's clearly a chip off her Dad's block. Both pour
milk first into their bowl, then Charley drops in Super
Sugar Crisp while Parker pours in Count Chocula. Both
hit 'em with a couple of spoons of extra sugar.
Mom takes a seat, too, primly eating a piece of dry wheat
toast that she slices in half first. Like Mom, like
Drew.
Drew spots the BLACKBERRY JPEG of Warren before Parker
can turn it over.DREWAnother one for the trophy room,
             huh?(CONTINUED)6.CONTINUED:PARKERBoys can be fun. You should try
             one some time.QUINN(to Drew)
             You ready for your interview?DREW(funny you
                      should ask)
             I've prepared a color-coded
             itinerary based on dividing the
             day into fifteen minute increments
             alternating blue/red, double-
             checked the train schedule,
             confirmed with the Weather Channel
             and rehearsed a couple of
             alternate scenarios last night,
             you know, just to account for all
             the possible glitches.PARKERWe'll take that as a yes.CHARLEYI'm proud of you for sticking to
             your plan all these years, sweety.PARKERI still don't understand why you
             want to finish college in two
             years? What's the big hurry?DREWI want to hit the ground running.
             All those football games and the
             partying and the whole dating
             scene. It just seems like a lot
             of wasted time that could be spent
             more productively.QUINNThe Accelerated program would look
             great on your med school
             application.PARKERFootball games I get. But
             partying? A waste of time?
Parker looks to her dad.     He shrugs.(CONTINUED)7.CONTINUED:CHARLEYTo each her own.QUINNWell, Drew.   I have a surprise.
Everybody stops what they're doing for a BEAT.QUINNI took the day off.
                     (excitedly)
             I'm going into the City with you.DREW(panicked)
             What -- ?!
Drew CHOKES on her granola and a little milk trickles out
her nose.QUINNIsn't that great! We can do some
             shopping, have lunch, real girl
             stuff. Won't that be fun?PARKERIf you want to have fun, I'm the
             one who should go, not Mother
             Teresa over there.
Drew is still choking -- pretty badly.PARKERLet me know if you want me to do
             the Heimlich. It'd be cool to
             have you owe me your life.
WHOOSH!   The granola goes down and she sucks air.QUINNYou okay?DREW(still clearing)
             No... I mean, it's... impossible.
             I've got every minute accounted
             for right up to the interview.
             Blue and red! It won't work.QUINNI just thought... you know... I've
             been working and we haven't had a
             chance to spend much time
             together...(CONTINUED)8.CONTINUED:Quinn, the normally thick-skinned M.D., is tearing up.QUINN... and both my babies are going
             away to college next Fall.
She takes her plate and goes to the sink and Parker
follows her, putting an arm around her shoulder.PARKERDon't be sad, Mom. Just think,
             when Drew leaves for school, you
             won't be losing a daughter, you'll
             be losing an anal-retentive social
             misfit who will be voted most
             likely to die a virgin.
Drew throws an arm around Quinn's other shoulder.DREWI'm sorry, Mom. It's really sweet
             of you. But don't worry. Parker
             will be living here with you
             forever since no college on earth
             will ever take her.QUINNStop it, you two.
Mom blows her nose.PARKERIt's not fair you guys get to go
             into the City and I don't.CHARLEYDon't you have a chem test, young
             lady?PARKERChemistry? Please. Name one time
             you ever used chemistry in your
             life.CHARLEY(beat)
             Good point.QUINN(adamant)
             I use chemistry every day.(CONTINUED)9.CONTINUED:PARKERYou're a    doctor, Mom. I'm not
             going to    be a doctor. I can't
             even say    the word 'orifice,' let
             alone put    a finger up one.
The BEEP BEEP of Drew's alarm WATCH signals time to go.
Drew is trying to cover up, but she's reeling from the
news that her mother's going to accompany her.DREW(worried)
             Time to go.INT. DREW'S ROOM - MORNINGDrew's room looks like a four-star hotel suite. Almost
trembling with tension, she ENTERS and immediately sits
down at her desk with her DAYPLANNER, turning to the
present DATE:CLOSE ON THE PAGE, WHERE EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES IS COLOR-CODED AND ACCOUNTED FOR RIGHT UP TO...2:07 -- PROFESSOR QUE SPAULDING, CHAIR, NEW YORKUNIVERSITY ACCELERATED STUDIES PROGRAM, ADMINISTRATIONBUILDING, SUITE 101.QUINN (O.S.)Come on, honey! Let's tear up
             Manhattan!
With a shiver, Drew closes the book, looks up into the
mirror, takes a squirt off her inhaler to calm herself
and tries some self-reassurance.DREWYou're smart. You're resourceful.
             You'll find a way to make it work.
She tries to sell herself on this by smiling, but
something in the smile suggests SHE'S SCREWED.
Collecting her Dayplanner, purse, interview file and cell
phone, she drops them into her matching Coach shoulder bag.


EXT. DRIVEWAY - MacLEOD HOUSE - MORNING
Quinn hops in her Saab.
ANGLE ON the doorway, where Drew pauses, takes a deep
breath to brace herself, then walks like a condemned
prisoner to her mother's car and climbs in.10.INT. QUINN'S SAAB - CONTINUOUS ACTIONRING! Quinn's CELL PHONE goes off. Quinn looks annoyed,
checks the incoming number. Drew closes her eyes and
prays.QUINN(to phone)
          Doctor MacLeod...
                  (beat; winking
                   at Drew)
          I'm sorry, but my itinerary is
          booked solid today. Call Dr.
          Wessels. He's covering for me.

          He did?
                  (beat)
          Are you sure it's the baby's head?
                  (beat)
          All right. I'm coming.
Frustrated, Mom hangs up and with a look of profound
disappointment, turns to Drew.QUINNI'm sorry, hon. It's a Blue Light
          special in Maternity. Every bed's
          full and some poor woman is about
          to give birth in the gift shop. I
          have to go in.
Drew musters her best sad, sad face for her mom.DREWAh, darn it, Mom. That's a shame.
          It's like fate is conspiring
          against us.QUINNI know.DREWYou absolutely, positively have to
          promise me we'll do it another
          time.QUINNI promise. I better hurry. Have
          Parker drop you at the train
          station on her way to school, will
          you?
Quinn gives her daughter a smile and a kiss.(CONTINUED)11.CONTINUED:QUINNKill 'em in that interview.DREW(beat)
             Mom, you know, I might not get in.QUINNAre you kidding me? You're Drew
             MacLeod. Nobody's smarter, nobody
             works harder and nobody, and I
             mean nobody, is ever more
             prepared.
Drew smiles, hugs her mom and jumps out, waving as her
mom backs down the drive and disappears down the street.
With the weight of the world suddenly lifted from her
shoulders, Drew looks to the sky and mouths, "thank you."
This is when Parker comes hauling down the driveway in
her Honda Accord. Drew signals her to stop, so of course
her sister IGNORES HER and jets into the street.DREWHey!   Stop!
Drew takes off running after the car!DREWPARKER!!EXT. PHILADELPHIA TRAIN STATION - MORNINGCommuters all jump from their cars and into the station.INT. THE GIRLS' HONDA - MORNINGParker pulls up to the curb at the station.       Drew
collects her bag.PARKERGood luck with your interview.
Drew pauses, holding the door open.DREWYou know, Parker. Chemistry is
             important. When you think about
             it, everything's made of
             chemicals.(CONTINUED)12.CONTINUED:PARKEROh, I'm interested in chemistry.
             Just not the kind with all the
             numbers and stinky test tubes.
Drew shuts the door and hustles off into the train
station. Parker SIGHS, looks to the BLACKBERRY on the
seat next to her.PARKERAh, chemistry.INT. FIRST TRAIN CAR - MORNINGDrew finds a seat.     She neatly folds her jacket and sets
it next to her.
She pulls out a lumbar support pillow and tucks it behind
her -- just right. Next, she takes out a tiny inflatable
lap desk, blows it up and sets it across her lap. A pen
goes in the little holder. Coffee from her Thermos.
After laying out her interview materials, she turns to
her reflection in the window.DREW(low; rehearsing)
             Professor Spaulding. Good
             afternoon. I'm Drew MacLeod.
An EXECUTIVE takes the aisle seat next to her, and after
a sideways glance at Drew's portable office, opens his
Wall Street Journal as the train begins to pull away.
EVERY COMMUTER is quietly reading the paper or staring
off into their own world, wondering why their life has
lead them to this sad moment when...
... they're all distracted by an AWFUL, AWFUL VOICE
singing Sheryl Crow's "Soak Up the Sun." It's Parker,
wearing her headphones and looking for a seat in the full
train car.
Drew stares at her, dumbfounded.DREWWhat do you think you're doing?PARKER(too loud; with
                      headphones on)
             Looking for a seat.(CONTINUED)13.CONTINUED:DREWThis can't be happening. Wait, I
             know. This is one of those Ground
             Hog Day dreams, isn't it?
Drew pinches herself too hard.DREWOw!
                     (to Parker)
             I'm awake now. You're supposed to
             disappear.PARKER(still too loud)
             You know, I just got this itch.DREWThen scratch it and get back to
             school.PARKERI couldn't concentrate anyway.
             I'm too... distracted today.DREWYou're permanently distracted.
             It's called Attention Deficit
             Disorder.
                     (spotting her
                       Blackberry)
             Is this about that chat room guy?
             It is, isn't it?
A look from the Exec reminds Parker of her headphones and
she pulls them off.PARKERNo! It's about spontaneity, which
             you obviously wouldn't know
             anything about.DREWI swear to God, Parker, you go
             through boyfriends like Junior
             Mints. It's pathetic.PARKERPathetic? You want to talk about
             pathetic?! At least I don't count
             getting accidentally felt up in
             dodge ball as my first date!(MORE)(CONTINUED)14.CONTINUED:PARKER (CONT'D)You're going to be eighteen and
             you've never even HAD a boyfriend!
The EXECUTIVE furrows his brow at Drew -- never?DREWIs this any of your business?
He goes back to his paper.DREWThis is ridiculous. I don't    have
             time for this today. Fine.      Don't
             graduate from high school.     Make a
             mess of your life over some
             complete stranger. I don't     care.
             But leave me out. I have
             something important I need    to
             accomplish today, so please    go
             away.EXECUTIVE(to Parker)
             Would you like this seat so you
             two can fight?DREW/PARKERNo thank you.
Drew's ALARM WATCH BEEPS.DREWI have to mentally preview my day
             now. I can't talk anymore.
Parker turns to go, then remembers something.PARKERUh, Drew? Do you have any money?
             I don't have enough for a ticket.
Drew just rolls her eyes and turns her back on her
sister.
The Executive peers over his spectacles at Parker with
the old paternal reprimand look.PARKERPlease.   Like you never ditched
             school.CUT TO:15.INT. SECOND TRAIN CAR - MORNINGParker's got her headphones back on and is SINGING Uncle
Cracker's "Follow Me," torturing everyone in her car.PARKER'You don't know how you met me...'
But when she spots the CONDUCTOR ENTERING the front of
the car, she abruptly stops, slips down in he seat and
slides past the COMMUTER LADY next to her into the aisle.PARKERExcuse me.
Parker heads the opposite direction from the ticket-
taking Conductor and out the back of the train car.INT. THE TRAIN - WOMEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTIONParker stands by the door, waiting, listening to hear if
the coast is clear.
Sounds good. She cracks the door, steps out on tiptoes,
closes the door and THERE'S THE CONDUCTOR. He smiles.CONDUCTORTicket, please.PARKERWhy don't I save the b.s. story
          and just ask you to cut me a break
          this one time because I know
          you've got a big heart and you
          remember what it was like when you
          were young and... and...

the train into the FIRST CAR.PARKER(calling after)
          I guess you were never young and
          randy!
This is when she sees Drew sitting in the train window,
smiling and giving her a little victory wave.16.INT. FIRST TRAIN CAR - MORNINGThe Conductor heads up the aisle -- does a double-take
when he sees Drew.CONDUCTORVery funny.DREWExcuse me?CONDUCTORLet's go.
He takes her by the arm.DREWWhat are you doing?
Drew scrambles to grab her bag, jacket, the little
inflatable lap desk falling to the floor.CONDUCTORI tried to be nice about it, but
          if you want the police involved,
          this is the way to do it.DREWPolice?     I didn't do anything.CONDUCTORNo ticket, no train ride.DREW(realizing)
          No! That's not me! That was my
          twin sister you threw off!CONDUCTORYoung lady, in thirty years I have
          heard every possible line but
          that's the lamest ever.DREW(pointing)
          She's right there!ANGLE ON THE PLATFORMNo Parker.
He hauls Drew down the aisle but as they EXIT THE CAR,SHE BUMPS HEAD-ON INTO BIKE MESSENGER/PRE-MED/MOUNTAINCLIMBER/MALE MODEL GUY -- they really do CRACK FOREHEADS,OUCH!(CONTINUED)17.CONTINUED:IS DREW SEEING STARS? OR IS IT THE MAGIC OF THIS INSTANTIN TIME WITH DREAM GUY?BOTH OF THEM SHAKE OFF THE WOOZIES.     He smiles:DREAM GUYYou okay?DREWI'm... ouch.CONDUCTORShe's fine, considering she should
             be in jail.
As the Conductor escorts her down the stairs, she and
Dream Guy share a last look before she's...
... left on the platform just as the train's pulling out.
Still no sign of Parker and Drew doesn't have all her
wits about her.DREWThis   can't be happening! I have
             a...   a... little paper thingy.
             What   are they called? Ticket! I
             have   a ticket! It's right...
She drops her bag, contents spilling willy-nilly. On her
hands and knees, she frantically searches for her ticket
in the mess.
The Conductor, however, is already on the train stop as
it pulls away. He just waves, victorious.
Parker    steps back out onto the platform and the Conductor

scopes the situation, which isn't good -- stranded
COMMUTERS jostle for the few remaining TAXIS.
TWO EXECUTIVES get into a shoving match.
To the left, a couple of BLACK LINCOLN TOWN CARS --
standard car service rigs -- sit IDLING, each with a
DRIVER next to it, holding up his sign with his client's
name scratched on it.
An EXECUTIVE (#2) passes her, finger in the air,
signaling the FIRST DRIVER who holds a sign that read:
"Wilcox."EXECUTIVE #2That's me.
With no further ado, the driver opens the back door for
him, the Exec climbs in, the driver hustles around to his
side and in an instant, the car leaves the chaos behind.
Parker raises an eyebrow.    Hm.
The second driver (BENNIE) with a head like a cinder
block and no neck, is talking on his cell phone and
holding up a sign, "SCARPELLI."
Parker shoots a finger into the air. This barely gets
his attention but he nods, nonchalantly. Parker signals
again -- one minute -- then turns back inside.INT. TRENTON TRAIN STATIONDrew has reached the counter, where a bitter TRAIN CLERK
who wishes he'd paid attention in school is tired of

Parker leads her into traffic, HORNS BLARING, as they
weave their way across. On the far side, a HORSE

manages to get across it to the curb. For just a BEAT,

Then they see Bennie crossing in traffic, huffing and
puffing after them and not seeing the pile, which he hits
in full stride, slips on, and PLOPS INTO on his ass.
