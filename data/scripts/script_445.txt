entertaining a group of black children.  He leads them in
the singing of a Christmas Carol (Hark the Herald Angels
Sing).  The man is DETECTIVE FIRST GRADE JIMMY DOYLE.  His
attention is split between the children and the activity
inside the bar.INT. THE BAR - DOYLE'S POV - DAYThe place is crowded with mid-day drinkers.  Dimly outlined
at the far end of the bar are TWO BLACK MEN involved in some
kind of transaction in which a package is exchanged for
money.  As the transaction seems to be completed, cut toEXT. THE BAR - DAYSanta Claus (DOYLE) starts to ring his big Christmas bell,
above the singing.  The bell is a signal to DETECTIVE SECOND
GRADE BUDDY RUSSO.  At this moment RUSSO is in the clothes
of a hot dog vendor and is in fact working behind a hot dog
wagon.  At the ringing of DOYLE's bell he takes off his
apron, leaves the wagon, and runs toward the bar.DOYLE(as RUSSO passes him)
            The guy in the brown coat.INT. THE BAR - DAYRUSSO enter the bar on the run.  He stops and looks over the
room.RUSSO'S POVThere are TWENTY or THIRTY MEN at the bar, at least TEN are
wearing brown coats!  The TWO MEN involved in the deal see
RUSSO and start to run.  One (THE BUYER) takes off out of
the back door.  The other (THE PUSHER) jumps over the bar
and heads for the front entrance.3.EXT. THE BAR - DAYTHE PUSHER dashes out past Santa Claus (DOYLE).  RUSSO
follows him and all three give chase.EXT. BED-STUY TENEMENT ALLEY - DAYTHREE FIGURES running down a New York tenement alley, the
first in flight, the others in pursuit.  We pick up the
incredible clutter of such an alley, mounts of rusting beer
cans, paper bags of garbage bulging and ripping open, old
bed springs, burned out mattresses, etc.EXT. BED-STUY TENEMENT ALLEY - DAYClose shot of BLACK PUSHER tripping on the tangle of trash
going up against the wall in his stumble, face toward the
camera, and the figures of RUSSO and DOYLE leaping upon him
from off-camera.  There is a blur or fast struggle as DOYLE
and RUSSO try to get his arms and put him against the wall.
BLACK PUSHER writhes loose and we close in on a knife in his
hand, plunging rapidly into RUSSO'S left forearm.RUSSOSon of a bitch!

The words are both warning and a grunt of pain.  As RUSSO
takes the blade and utters the words, we simultaneously go
to DOYLE crouching and snatching his .38 out of the right
ankle holster.EXT. BED-STUY TENEMENT ALLEY - DAYClose shot of DOYLE and the BLACK PUSHER, DOYLE pistol-
whipping him into submission with three lightening chops of
the gun to the PUSHER'S head.  DOYLE continues to beat the
man mercilessly into submission.INT. DOYLE'S CAR - DAY3-shot of BLACK PUSHER sitting between DOYLE and RUSSO.
DOYLE is at the wheel.  BLACK PUSHER is sitting on his
hands, wrists manacled behind him, his head down and dripping
blood onto the jacket and the canary-yellow turtleneck.  All
three are breathing hard.DOYLEWhat's your name, asshole?BLACK PUSHERFuck you, Santa Claus!

DOYLE hits him across the face.4.RUSSOYour name is Willie Craven.

BLACK PUSHER doesn't look up.DOYLEWho's your connection, Willie?
            What's his name?

No response.RUSSOWho killed the old Jew in the
            laundromat?

BLACK PUSHER's brow furrows, looks up just a little.BLACK PUSHERI don't...DOYLEEver pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?BLACK PUSHERWhat?DOYLEDid you ever pick your feet in
            Poughkeepsie?BLACK PUSHERI don't know what you're talkin'
            about.DOYLEWere you ever in Poughkeepsie?BLACK PUSHERNo... yeah...DOYLEDid you ever sit on the edge of the
            bed, take off your socks and stick
            your fingers between your toes?BLACK PUSHERMan, I'm clean.DOYLEYou made three sales to your
            roaches back there.  We had to
            chase you through all this shit and
            you tell me you're clean?5.RUSSOWho stuck up the laundromat?DOYLEHow about that time you were
            picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?

The BLACK PUSHER'S eyes go to RUSSO in panic, looking for
relief from the pressure of the inquisition.RUSSO(in pain)
            You better give me the guy who got
            the old Jew or you better give me
            something or you're just a memory
            in this town.BLACK PUSHERThat's a lot o' shit.  I didn't do
            nothin'.

The BLACK PUSHER's eyes are on DOYLE, frozen in confusion
and fear.DOYLEYou put a shiv in my partner.  Know
            what that means?  All winter I
            gotta listen to him gripe about his
            bowling scores.  Now I'm gonna bust
            your ass for those three bags -
            then I'm gonna nail you for pickin'
            your feet in Poughkeepsie.EXT. HEADQUARTERS NARCOTICS BUREAU OF THE NYPD 12 OLD SLIPAND SOUTH STREETS - NIGHTDOYLE and RUSSO standing side by side on the front steps of
the old First Precinct on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.
RUSSO has his overcoat over his shoulders as a cape.  The
sleeve of his left arm is rolled up over a blood-stained
bandage on the left forearm.DOYLEHavin' trouble?  You're a dumb
            guinea.RUSSOHow'd I know he had a knife.DOYLENever trust a nigger.RUSSOHe coulda been white.6.DOYLENever trust anybody.  You goin' sick?RUSSONot a chance.

RUSSO nods in acceptance of the remark.  The easy, synical
rapport between them is obvious: they are partners in a
business where somebody is always getting hurt and pain is
part of the inventory.DOYLELet's popeye around the Chez for a
            half hour, catch the end of the
            show and a couple drinks.RUSSOSome other time Jimmy, I'm beat.

DOYLE reaches into the right side pocket of BUDDY's suitcoat
for a cigarette and matches.  He lights up two in the pause,
sticks one in RUSSO's mouth.DOYLECome on -- one drink.  Whatta you
            say?RUSSODrink this.DOYLEWhip it out.INT. THE CLUB - NIGHTTHE TITLES COMMENCETHE FRENCH CONNECTIONTitles over a close shot of a chorus line, with lots of tits
and ass and lean, long legs in a brassy blare of music.  We
zoom back to the area where DOYLE and RUSSO are beginning to
occupy a table.  RUSSO takes the seat on the right, eyes
immediately on all that ginch, while DOYLE standing, gives
their order.  We do not hear the dialogue but DOYLE asks
RUSSO what he wants BUDDY looks up and says "Cinzano." DOYLE
turns and says "Two of these." DOYLE slips into the chair
opposite RUSSO and the titles roll on.  Unlike RUSSO who is
concentrating on the girls, DOYLE is digging the room and
the people who occupy the tables in it, as if he is the sort
of man who cannot relax until he knows who is around him,
why they are there.7.INT. THE CLUB - NIGHTA long view from DOYLE's position of the room, a quick
certain survey that stumbles twice; on laughter that seems
too raw and then over a flurry of activity by WAITERS and
CAPTAINS serving a table on the main floor.  DOYLE's
attention is apprehended by the noise and activity that
emanate from the same large table.DOYLEI make at least two junk connections
            at that table in the corner.  The
            guy is the stripe combo, I know him
            too.RUSSOHey, I thought we come for a drink.INT. THE CLUB - NIGHTA long view of the table with DOYLE and RUSSO very close
foreground, left and right.  DOYLE is leaning on an elbow.DOYLEWho is that guy?RUSSOPolicy man in Queens.DOYLEWhat about the last of the big-time
            spenders.  You make him?

RUSSO's eyes come off the show.  It is a direct line from
DOYLE's gaze to the round, ruddy and arrogant face of SAL
BOCA, the apparent host of the table of EIGHT MEN AND WOMEN,
the Men in dinner jackets with ties tucked under the collars
of blue or white lace-trimmed shirts, the Women in a mixture
of pant suits and Catskills cocktail party dresses, their
hair coiffed towers.RUSSONo, you?DOYLEHunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He
            spreads it like the Russians are in
            Jersey.RUSSOHe probably sells insurance.  Owns
            a chicken farm in Hackensack.8.Zoom in slowly on SAL as he deals tips and orders.  Through
DOYLE's eyes, we go from Guest to Guest at SAL's table,
taking apart their manners and styles as they talk and
laugh, lost in the show chatter.INT. THE CLUB - NIGHTDOYLE finishing his drink, still looking at the table.DOYLEDig who's just come over.  The
            creep on the end.INT. THE CLUB - NIGHTThe camera pans down the table to dig the "creep on the end."RUSSO (VO)Jewish Lucky from the Bronx... He
            don't look the same without a
            number across his chest.INT. THE CLUB - NIGHTDOYLE close in right profile, SAL's table in the far blurred
background.DOYLEWhatta you say we wait and give him
            a tail?RUSSOGive who a tail?DOYLEThe greaser with the blonde.RUSSOWhat for -- you wanna play Hide the
            Salami with his old lady?DOYLECome on -- just for fun --INT/EXT. DOYLE'S CAR - NIGHTThe view from the back seat of DOYLE's car.  DOYLE is at the
wheel, RUSSO packed uncomfortably into the corner at DOYLE's
right.  Seventy-five yards away on the other side of the
street the canopied entrance of the Club.  A Continental is
parked in front of the club.  The DRIVER leaning on a fender
talking with the DOORMAN.  DOYLE frisks his own pockets for
a cigarette, coming up with a collection of laundry slips,
crumpled notes, toothpicks and matches.9.One of the slips of paper catches his eye as he is going
through the ritual of the cigarette mooch, a slip bearing
the name of a girl.  His attention is really on the entrance
of the Club and both his conversation and the cigarette
business are detached and incidental to the art of waiting
through the stakeout.  He stuffs the cards back into his
pocket.DOYLEMonica?  Who's Monica?RUSSO(handing him a cigarette)
            A and A, that's all you're
            interested in -- Arrests and Ass.

As soon as DOYLE has finished lighting the cigarette SAL and
his PARTY come bubbling out of the Club noisily, a little
drunkenly.  SAL waves to the attentive DOORMAN.

DOYLE close, leaning forward over the wheel to put his hand
on the ignition key.  He does not turn it.  He is waiting
for the cover of noise from the starting of SAL's car.
RUSSO is turning the opposite corner of the car into a bend,
his head back, arms across his chest.DOYLECloudy, I'll lay odds he takes us
            to Little Italy.

DOYLE reaches under his seat for the straw surveillance
hat - throws it up to read ledge of car.RUSSOI'm telling you, Popeye, he owns a
            bagel mine in the Bronx.

A long view of the Club entrance.  SAL and ANGIE, a well-
built "classy" blonde with good legs, get into their black
Mercury sedan.  The Mercury takes off towards First Avenue.
We hear DOYLE's car start and we move off after them on the
last blink of tail-lights at the corner.EXT. BROADWAY - NIGHTCabs, Daily News and Times delivery trucks, bakery vans and
a few cruising cabs, one or two passenger cars and a coasting
green and black police cruiser -- this is the 4:30 a.m.
traffic through which DOYLE moves.

A rear-window view of SAL and ANGIE BOCA, in animated
conversation.  His head is turned toward her, his hand
raised in a gesture.  ANGIE is sitting in a corner with her
back to the door, in profile to the back window.10.Her blonde head bobbles with laughter over some remark SAL
has made.

A long overhead view of the two cars wheeling in and out of
the sparse traffic.

off.  Hold for DOYLE's car as it passes through after them.EXT. MULBERRY STREET - DAYSide close view of SAL turning south into Mott Street
panning to pick up the Italian names on the candy stores,
funeral parlors, bars, grocery stores, social clubs.

A long view of SAL's car from the DOYLE-RUSSO auto, over the
shoulders of the two cops.  DOYLE is leaning on the wheel of
his car.  He's against the curb about 100 yards behind SAL.

Medium close view of SAL in the middle of Mott Street,
walking quickly toward the opposite side of the street,
hands in the pocket of his white raincoat.  He glances over
his shoulder in the direction of DOYLE's car.

Close of RUSSO who has come awake.  The smart-ass demeanor
has dropped away.  DOYLE turns to him and smiles.  This
district is the heart of every illegal activity in New York.

Close rear view of DOYLE and RUSSO ducking down to the level
of the dashboard, a reflex action.  He couldn't see them at
that distance, although SAL, lighted by his own headlights,
can be seen in the background walking around the cars,
across the sidewalk and stopped at a recessed doorway.

Medium close shot of SAL and partially visible FIGURE at the
doorway.  With another glance up the street, SAL takes
something out of his raincoat pocket and steps up and into
the doorway.INT. DOYLE'S CAR - DAYClose from the front of DOYLE and RUSSO low against the
dashboard.DOYLEIt's a drop!

DOYLE's face, close, light smile.11.Long view of SAL walking down the sidewalk quickly for about
a quarter of a block while the headlights of his car, with
ANGIE apparently driving, move up with him.  At another
doorway, he looks back and then steps inside.EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAYLong view of SAL's Mercury moving over Brooklyn Bridge.

each other.

SAL and ANGIE stop in the street beside beat-up white Dodge.
Without a word they get in.  Hold as they get in, SAL starts
and they begin to drive out of the spot.

Close on DOYLE.DOYLEIt's startin' to cook, Cloudy, my
            man is cookin'...

A series of impressionist traveling shots of the white Dodge
and DOYLE's Ford moving through Brooklyn Streets, picking up

candy store as SAL and ANGIE open door and go in.

Close shot of DOYLE and RUSSO parked.  DOYLE is looking in
the rear-view mirror while BUDDY is turned around on the
seat, looking out the rear window.

A long shot, from the DOYLE-RUSSO viewpoint of the candy
store.  The door is open, the street is deserted.  Lights
are going on in the little shop.12.Hold on the storefront as SAL appears, this time in a candy
store operator's smock over a white undershirt, baggy slacks.
He's carrying a stack of newspapers.  Zoom in on SAL stacking
the Sunday Times and the Daily News on the rack in front of
the store as ANGIE appears in the doorway.  She's blackhaired
now, the blonde wig gone, also wearing a grey cotton smock
over a plain skirt and sweater, holding a cup of coffee.  We
hold on them for a beat, thenCUT TO:DOYLE and RUSSO close just looking at each other.  The look
says everything about the freak case they have stumbled into.EXT. QUAY MARSEILLE SHIPYARD1) Tight two shot then, 2) cut into blue prints.CHARNIEREn prolongeant les quais d'une

about 11 o'clock and relatively quiet.  A scattering of
tenement URCHINS give the street some sound and life.  There
are a couple of dark shops on the street and a bar, all
appearing to be closed.  We look down the street and pick up
DOYLE and RUSSO coming down it, walking very quickly.  They
are heading toward the bar.  A young man is coming out -
they grab him and throw him back.INT. BAR ROOM - DAYThe Young Man is thrown in, followed by DOYLE and RUSSO.
There are about 20 or 30 PUETRO RICAN and BLACK MEN in the
joint, a couple of BLACK WOMEN.  They are in all manner of
dress.  Half of them are wearing shades.  The bar is noisy
with conversation, laughter and music.23.DOYLE and RUSSO standing in the doorway, DOYLE slightly to
the left, RUSSO a little behind him.  DOYLE's arms are at
his sides.  RUSSO's right hand is crossed over his belt,
under his jacket and on the butt of his .38, ready, waiting
to back his partner's play or respond to any move within the
bar.

DOYLE moving into the bar alone.  He pulls the plug out of
the Juke Box, plunging the room to silence.DOYLEHands on your heads.  Popeye's here!

Twenty men raise hands to their heads as one.  The raggle-
taggle swarm plays a kind of human chicken, refusing to move
until the last moment then stepping out of his way.  One of
the customers doesn't.DOYLEWhat's my name?1ST MANDoyle.DOYLEWhat?1ST MANMr. Doyle.DOYLEEver pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?1ST MANWhat?

DOYLE raises his left arm and pushes the MAN aside.  The
MAN's eyes go to RUSSO, off-camera at the door, and back to
DOYLE.  He doesn't resist; he gets in line with the rest of
them, a line formed about four or five feet from the bar,
running the length of it.

Close of DOYLE at the bar, holding an ashcan and skimming
the metal underrailing with one finger, knocking off the
magnetized key boxes into the ashcan.  He isn't even looking
at them.  His eyes are across the bar, staring down the
customers.

into it.

of the boxes, taking out the ten dollar bill, putting it on
the bar.24.Then, opening another, taking out the glassine deck of
heroin.  Then another, containing a glassine deck.  He
empties the glassine envelopes on the bar into a cocktail
mixer which he proceeds to shake.  The shaker is half-filled
with tomato juice.

DOYLE leaning over the bar toward the glaring crowd, pours
the mixture into the ashcan.DOYLEMilk shake anyone?

He wiggles his finger.  It is a command for THREE MEN to
step forward.  The MEN do not move at first.DOYLEMove ass when I tell you.

They move, shuffling, hesitatingly.  But they move -- TWO
BLACKS and A PUETRO RICAN.DOYLEPut it on the bar.

Hands of the THREE MEN going into pockets.

Close of a miscellany of keys, coins, cigarettes going onto
the bar -- with two hypodermics, six or eight marijuana
cigarettes, a small plastic vial of barbiturates.DOYLE(collecting the works)

RUSSO pulls the man off the bar, sends him into one of the
phone booths.

another man, who has just come out of the toilet.DOYLEWhat about you?  Can you stand a

Inside the toilet of the bar.  The MAN is up against the
wall.  DOYLE is only inches away.

The MAN is an AGENT and this is the only way DOYLE can get
immediate information from him without destroying the man's
cover.  Their conversation is in whispers.  And very fast.DOYLEHow's everything?2ND MANEverything is everything.DOYLEHow come there's nothing out there?

Door of toilet.  There is a hell of a crash and slamming
behind it.  Door opens and DOYLE steps out over the crumpled
prostrate form of the INFORMER.  He has just decked the man
to continue the protection of the cover.  He pauses halfway
down the line as if he's speculating on beating up another
one because he didn't get any information.  But he decides
that would be futile too.DOYLEI'm goin' check on this address in

While he keeps looking forward after SAL, he also looks
regularly to the left, across to the West side of Madison
where we quickly zoom in on the figure of BILL MULDERIG, who
is on an even line opposite SAL and moving almost precisely
in step with the subject of their surveillance.  MULDERIG
keeps an eye on SAL but is also glancing north ahead of SAL
to BUDDY RUSSO, who is 20 or 30 feet ahead of SAL, thus
forming the triangle of the A-B-C tail.

cigarettes, and they turn back in DOYLE's direction.

DOYLE, face to face with CHARNIER and NICOLI.  Straining to
hear, he picks up a few words of French.  Without losing
stride he steps off the curb and cuts across the street,
moving south, away from them, as they come north.  But
halfway across the street, we pick up RUSSO coming in his

opposite the CHEMIST.60.SAL has a glass of beer in front of him, WEINSTOCK a brandy
snifter containing a splash of amber cognac.  Both are

The CHEMIST immerses a capillary tube, a tiny instrument the
size of a needle into an open kilo of heroin.

He pours a small quantity of mineral oil into a burnmeister
test tube and preheats the oil over the open flame of a tiny
alcohol lamp.

He removes a 15-in thermometer from its leather case,
fastens the capillary tuve (now totally immersed in the
heroin) to the bulb of the thermometer with a rubber band.

He places the bulb, with capillary attached, into an open
rubber stop and inserts the entire apparatus into the
burnmeister tube, about three inches in.

With a small metal clamp he holds the rig over the lamp.

We watch closely with the CHEMIST, WEINSTOCK and BOCA as the
white heroin powder slowly, agonizingly dissolves into the
mineral oil and

The mercury rises slowly up the thermometer to 220� - 230�.

anxiety.  As the mercury continues to rise they become a
cheering section, rooting the hometeam home.
