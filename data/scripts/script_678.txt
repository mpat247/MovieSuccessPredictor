    Leo Tolstoy-   Anna Karenina1   EXT. COUNTRYSIDE. DAY.                                        1High angle of the steam train travelling through a wide
    river valley. The stack belching smoke against the Russian
    sky.2   INT. SECOND CLASS CARRIAGE. COUNTRY SIDE. DAY.                2Leo Tolstoy (80), sits writing on his lapboard. He is quite
    simply the greatest living writer in the world. His
    devotion to pacifism, his rejection of the trappings of
    Orthodoxy in favor of a simple Christian lifestyle convince
    many to regard him as a living saint. With him are his much
    younger wife, the COUNTESS SOFYA, favorite daughter SASHA,
    and his personal physician DUSHAN MAKOVITSKY. Sasha and
    Dushan write in their diaries. Sofya looks from one to the
    next a little impatient. The train begins to slow.SOFYAWhy are we slowing down?

    No one responds. Slower. Slower.SOFYAWe're stopping. Why are we
              stopping?SASHAI don't know, mother.    No idea.

    Tolstoy look up from his work, asks a passing conductor.SOFYAExcuse me, why has the train
              stopped?CONDUCTORIt's the crowd, ma'm, the people.
              They're blocking the track.

    In the distance we can here voices.VOICES (O.S.)Long live Tolstoy! Long live the
              old warrior!SOFYABut if they block the track, the
              train can't go...YOU HAVE TO MAKETHEM MOVE.2.The conductor shrugs, walks away. She goes to the window to
    investigate. A crowd of a hundred peasants, students
    surround the engine, block the track. They carry a huge
    cloth banner honoring Tolstoy. We can hear voices chanting
    "Tolstoy. Tolstoy. Tolstoy", voices crying "You are the
    truth." "You are the hope of the Russian people."SOFYAOh, they won't move. We are
              gonna die here. Leo, Leo, go and
              say something to them. It's the
              only way we are gonna get out of
              here.

    The chanting grows in intensity. Tolstoy gets to his feet,
    walks to the window, shows himself to the crowd. A great
    shout goes up. Tolstoy lifts his hand for silence.
    Gradually, it comes.TOLSTOYI have seen your banner. And I�ve
              heard what you say. You think I�m
              the hope of Russia, do you? Well,
              that�s not true. You are the hope
              of Russia. The hope of all the
              world. You say, you want a new
              way to live? Well, you are not
              gonna find it making a fuss over
              me. So, I suggest that you get on
              with your work and let a poor old
              men get on with his.

    The cries begin. "Clear the tracks. Let them pass. Let them
    go." Tolstoy closes the door and waves to the crowd as the
    train pulls away.3   EXT. COUNTRYSIDE. DAY.                                        3On the chanting crowd now as the train pulls away. We
    focus on a handsome young man, a little stiff maybe, a
    little intellectual. This is VALENTIN FEDOROVITCH
    BULGAKOV. He can't contain his enthusiasm. Over the noise
    of the train.VALENTINDo you know who that is? That is
              the greatest man in the world.

    The train pulls away into the distance.TITLE OVER BLACK: SPRING 19104   EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. DAWN.                                   4The ancestral home of the Tolstoy family in the first
    budding of spring.3.Muzhiks (peasants) gather wood, carry water to the house. A
     cart arrives loaded down with mail bags.5    INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. SOFYA'S BEDROOM. DAY.                   5A handsome room, walls covered with generations of family
     photographs. Religious icons are given pride of place, a
     testament, not to piety, but to an ingrained social
     conservatism, a certain position in the world.

     Countess Sofya mumbles her morning prayers before a make
     shift altar. Wiping away tears, she leaves the room.5A   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. ENTRY/STAIR. DAY.                     5ASofya walks down the stairs and through the entry passed an
     old servant asleep in a chair. She continues to the
     basement.6    INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. TOLSTOY'S BEDROOM/STUDY. DAY.           6Tolstoy has moved himself out of the refined upper floors
     into a simple vaulted room he uses as both bedroom and
     study. The walls are bare except for a portrait of his
     daughter. The furniture is simple, some of it hand made: a
     small bed against the wall, a little writing desk in one
     corner stacked with books, littered with papers, more mail,
     opened and unopened. Pairs of rude homemade shoes line a
     work bench.

     Tolstoy sleeps in his bed. Though it's late March and
     still cold, the window is open. Sofya closes it. She
     stands very still, watching Tolstoy sleep. Sitting on the
     bed, she gently touches his hand, whispers.SOFYADarling.

     She lies next to him, something girlish, hopeful in her
     face, as if waiting for him to wake up and adore her, but
     he sleeps on. She carefully takes his arm, positions it
     under her neck, and rolling toward him, wraps it around
     her. The image of love's intimacy, of wedded bliss.

     His hand slips off her shoulder, once, twice. She moves
     awkwardly to replace it. He moves a little toward her. She
     kisses his neck, his cheek. We don't know if he's awake,
     but even this shadow of intimacy penetrates her soul.7    OMITTED                                                       74.8   INT. MOSCOW. STUDY. DAY.                                      8A handsome study in the Moscow townhouse of VLADIMIR
    GRIGOREVICH CHERTKOV, Tolstoy's most articulate and
    dedicated disciple. He's interviewing Tolstoy's newly
    appointed secretary, VALENTIN BULGAKOV, the young man we
    met near the train, who, at the mention of sex, blushes a
    little.CHERTKOVBut sex... You are twenty three.
              Not an easy age for abstinence,
              is it?VALENTINTolstoy does not approve of
              sexual relations. I know this.CHERTKOVHe despises them, in fact...

    Chertkov reaches for a small tin of moustache wax.CHERTKOVI don't want to belabor the
              point, but I arranged for a
              manservant last year who
              proceeded to ruin two housemaids
              just like that. He was very
              upset.VALENTINThis would not be a problem. I'm
              celibate. I'm also a strict
              vegetarian.

    Chertkov nods his approval, begins to worry his moustache.CHERTKOVYes, I've heard many good things
              about you. I've even read what
              you`ve written. So has he.

    Valentin's face flushes with pride. Chertkov steals a
    glance at his reflection in the glass bookcase. One side of
    his moustache droops a little. He tugs awkwardly at it.CHERTKOVMy dear boy, if you were to
              become Tolstoy's private
              secretary, you would be given a
              great gift. You'll be with him
              every day, eat together, walk in
              the forest by his side.

    It's difficult to contain himself.5.VALENTINBelieve me, since becoming a
          Tolstoyan, I have become so eager
          to learn, so comitted to
          discussing ideas, improving my
          very soul.CHERTKOV(smiling)
          Well, we have a lot to do if we
          are to get his work to the
          people.VALENTINWe?

They both laugh.CHERTKOVYes, we. If we can encourage the
          spread of passive
          resistance...just think of it
          Valentin   thousands of ordinary
          Russians casting off centuries of
          spiritual and political
          oppression-VALENTINIn the name of truth and freedom.CHERTKOVTruth and freedom, yes but still,
          my boy, there are so many enemies-VALENTINEnemies?

Chertkov walks to the window, signals Valentin to follow
him. He points to

TWO MEN IN PLAINCLOTHES standing in the street below.CHERTKOVThe Czar's police...You'll be
          followed when you leave
          here...and the church will stop
          at nothing to bring him back into
          the fold. His children can't be
          trusted... only Sasha... and then
          of course there is the
          Countess...

          Well, one doesn't like to come

          movement...(MORE)6.CHERTKOV (cont'd)
              (beat)
          The point is, he needs a man of
          your intellectual gifts around
          him. Someone who can help him
          with the new work. Someone who
          understands his goals.

Chertkov returns to the desk.CHERTKOVAnd although they've allowed me
          to return to Russia, I can't see
          him. They keep me under house
          arrest... They might as well keep
          me in a cage.

Clearly upset, Chertkov pauses to get control of himself.
He picks up a package, hands it to Valentin.CHERTKOVSo, I need you to put these
          letters directly into his hands.
          One can't be sure what gets
          through to him.

Valentin looks at him, quizzical.CHERTKOVSofya Andreyevna does not respect
          his privacy.VALENTINShe wouldn't open his private
          correspondence...

Chertkov raises an eyebrow. An ominous silence.CHERTKOVI have another task for you, my
          dear.VALENTINPlease.CHERTKOVYou'll keep a diary for me.

He hands Valentin a notebook.CHERTKOVI need to know everything that
          goes on at Yasnaya Polyana. Let
          me know who visits the house, any
          talk of the copyright to his
          work, any contact with the
          church, what letters come and go.

     ushers him into the dying light.CHERTKOVGodspeed, my boy.

     Valentin makes his way to the droshky that awaits him.CHERTKOVAnd remember what I said.

     He turns back to the dark figure in the doorway.CHERTKOVWrite everything down! Go!10   EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. GROUNDS. MORNING.                       10SOFYA. Black and white film of her being handed the
     newspapers at the step. She looks up at the camera,
     irritated by its presence.

     CUTTING OUT TO COLOR we see a cinematographer on the lawn
     cranking away at his camera. She goes into the house.11   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. TOLSTOY'S BEDROOM/STUDY. MORNING.       11Where Tolstoy, awake and dressed, sits on his bed, pen in
     hand, writing in his diary. Dushan sits next to him, taking
     his pulse.TOLSTOYNothing's working... Hand me my
               other boot, my friend, will you?DUSHANLet me finish.TOLSTOYIt doesn't matter. If my heart
               had stopped beating, I'd still go
               riding today.DUSHANYour pulse is my
               responsibility...(MORE)8.DUSHAN (cont'd)
          and if you must ride, I insist
          you wear a coat. Even the sun is
          cold today.

He puts Tolstoy's arm down and hands him his riding boot.
Sofya comes ranting into the room carrying several Russian
and international dailies.SOFYAThis is impossible! It really is!
          These people are parasites!
          Look...
              (reading)
          "Countess Tolstoy has become
          estranged from her husband. They
          barely speak."

She throws the paper on the floor.SOFYAYou know who spreads all this
          rubbish....

She opens another paper, a French daily.SOFYAC'est la meme en France. They
          gossip about us in Paris... "They
          do not share a similar view of
          either religion or politics."
          Incroyable!TOLSTOY(smiling)
          Peut-etre. You think that's
          inaccurate?SOFYAI think it's none of the world's
          business.

She looks at Dushan who is transcribing every word into his
diary. He does it with all the master's conversations.SOFYAWhat are you doing? Don't do
          that.TOLSTOY(smiling)
          Dushan Petrovich, you're
          scribbling again?

Tolstoy moves with energy and purpose toward the door.SOFYADarling, where are you going?9.TOLSTOYRiding with Sasha. Don't expect
               us for lunch.

     Something strikes him. He walks to his desk, picks up his
     pen and quickly writes a sentence on a scrap of paper.SOFYALeovochka, why do you insist on
               dressing like that.TOLSTOYWhat do you mean?SOFYALike the man who looks after the
               sheep.TOLSTOYIt's not meant to offend you.SOFYABut it does offend me, because it
               offends reason. You're a Count,
               for God's sake.

     He puts his pen down, goes to her, kisses her gently on the
     forehead and leaves the room.SOFYAOh darling, I have something else
               to say.TOLSTOY (O.S.)I doubt it not, my dear.DUSHANHe's forgotten his coat.

     He runs after him, tripping over the long fur garment.DUSHAN (O.S.)Count Tolstoy, you've forgotten
               your coat.

     Meanwhile Sofya notices a photographic portrait of Chertkov
     on the wall. She takes it down and tosses it in the
     corner.12   EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. GROUNDS. DAY.                           12As Tolstoy appears on the porch, we hear the WHIR of
     cameras. A crowd of photographers, film cameramen,
     journalists, and disciples try to catch a glimpse of the
     master. Dushan steps in front of him.10.DUSHANLet him walk. Let him walk.JOURNALISTCount Tolstoy, you're no doubt
          distressed by the Czar's
          treatment of your secretary
          Nikolai Gusev ?TOLSTOYThese people are bandits.DUSHANI said, let him walk.TOLSTOYThey come into my house and
          arrest a man whose only crime is
          to express a view of life saner
          than that which prevails.JOURNALISTSo Gusev is innocent?TOLSTOY(nods)
          Of course, I'm the guilty one. I
          reject the Orthodox church. I
          condemn the established order and
          I make no secret of it.

A young peasant shouts from the crowd.PEASANTGod bless you, Tolstoy. Thank
          you.DUSHANLet him walk. Let him walk.
          (to Tolstoy)
          But you don't banish these people
          very much to your credit...I wish
          I had your largeness of spirit.

A photographer's flash goes off. An old Muzhik touches
Tolstoy's sleeve, as if expecting a miracle.

Sasha, her father's soulmate, leads two horses toward them,
her mount and her father's black gelding, Delire.SASHAPapa.TOLSTOYSasha!11.SASHADid you ride this morning?

     place in the overcrowded third class carriage. He writes in
     the diary given him by Chertkov. He glances up to see, on
     the bench across, a young mother taking out her breast to
     nurse her baby. He blushes, doesn't know where to look. An
     old peasant catches his eye, winks at him, laughs.16   EXT. TELYATINKI. DUSK.                                       16Seven miles from Tolstoy's estate, this is Telyatinki, a
     communal center created by Chertkov dedicated to the study
     and practice of Tolstoyism.SERGEYENKOTelyatinki was created by
               Vladimir Grigorevich as a center
               for the movement. Just last week
               we had a visitor from India. We
               talked to the group about the

     Sergeyenko, Chertkov's joyless secretary, and Valentin

          him. We all should.VALENTINThank you for the tea.

Their eyes meet, hold. Valentin's discomfort increases.MASHATomorrow you can make your own.

She walks to the door, turns to see him still watching her.15.MASHAHe's a sorry old tight-assed
               stick in the mud...but yes, he's
               sincere.21   EXT. ROAD TO YASNAYA POLYANA.   DAY.                          21A modest horse drawn cart. Valentin sits beside the driver,
     contemplates the birch trees that line the road, the long
     shadows they cast. Above, crows make lazy circles in the
     sky.22   OMITTED                                                       2223   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. ENTRY WAY/STAIRS. DAY.                  23Valentin stands in the entry way, waiting.   He looks lost.VALENTINHello...hello...VOICE (O.S.)You're the new secretary.

     He looks up to see Sasha examining him from the landing
     above.SASHAPapa's out. You can wait in the
               library. Ivan will show you up.

     She disappears. He hears a door close. He notices a surly
     house servant, IVAN, who, inexplicably, leads a goat
     through the house. He points upstairs and walks away.24   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. LIBRARY. DAY.                           24Alone now among Tolstoy's books, Valentin makes his way
     slowly to a writing table, the holy of holies, on which War
     and Peace and Anna Karenina were written. He runs his hand
     along the old wood top. Emboldened by a backward glance, he
     sits in Tolstoy's chair. Before him are stacks of letters,
     pens and pencils, a pot of India ink. There's a notebook
     lying open. He leans forward to read it. A noise in the
     hall stops him.

     Tolstoy enters from the dining room, red cheeked, beard
     dripping wet, the energy of a man ten years younger than he
     is. Valentin stands.TOLSTOYI'm glad you're here. So glad.16.He tromps across the room, kisses the boy enthusiastically
on both cheeks. Valentin is overcome by the great man's
warmth.VALENTINI'm... I'm... Here is-

Valentin interrupts himself with a sneeze.TOLSTOYGod bless you.VALENTINI'm sorry.     Sometimes I...

Valentin pulls out a letter of introduction. Tolstoy takes
it out and puts it down without a glance.TOLSTOYVladimir Grigorevich has already
          written about you at length. I
          need your help badly. The
          manifesto against the government
          is hard work. They commit their
          idiotic abuses faster than I can
          catalogue them...and the new
          book...VALENTINHe told me about it...It's very
          exciting.

Tolstoy nods.TOLSTOYI've become convinced that all
          the world's religions have a
          single organizing principle. Can
          you guess what it is? Love!
          Love! Simple... Now, I want to
          talk about you. How are you? How
          was your journey? Come, sit
          down.

Tolstoy sits on the old sofa. Valentin follows suit.TOLSTOYYou know, I was born on this
          sofa...

Valentin gets right back up. Tolstoy laughs, pats the sofa.TOLSTOYSit. Sit.

Valentin sits down.17.TOLSTOYMyself, my brother, my children,
               at least five or six of them,
               right here.

               Now, I've read your essays. How`s
               your work progressing?

     Valentin looks into the great man's kind old face. He tries
     to speak but he's overcome with emotion and begins to weep.TOLSTOYMy boy, what is it?
                   (beat)
               I upset you in some way. Was it
               the sofa? It's only a sofa.

     Valentin shakes his head, smiling through his tears.VALENTINI'm very happy. You are very
               kind. I'm no one and you are...
               you are Leo Tolstoy and you ask
               me about my work.

     Tolstoy takes Valentin's hand, sits him back on sofa.TOLSTOYYou rest for a moment and I'll
               fetch you a glass of tea. Rest,
               because there's work for both of
               us together.

     fortune.25   OMITTED                                                       2526   OMITTED                                                       2627   OMITTED                                                       2728   EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. GROUNDS. DAY.                           28Sofya, Sasha, Valentin, ANDREY, Tolstoy's son, and Tolstoy
     all clustered around a table taking tea. Dushan stands near
     the group fiddling with a gramophone that sits on a small
     table.SOFYAThese people have nothing.18.DUSHANIt really is the most
           extraordinary thing.

Absolutely ignoring him.SOFYAIt's not for lack of land that
           the muzhiks live in poverty.
           They have no will power and they
           drink too much.TOLSTOYI'm not suggesting they be given
           land. Private property is the
           root of the problem... We should
           be giving ours away.ANDREYGive it to whom?SOFYAIt's all ridiculous. You think
           that poverty makes the peasants
           somehow morally superior.TOLSTOYI believe that wealth corrupts us
           all, yes I do.

A pause.   Valentin fills the silence.VALENTINIt's a keystone of the movement.SOFYAOh, I know all about the
           movement.

A pause. Valentin notices that people from the front lawn
have moved up to watch all this. Life in the fishbowl, the
Tolstoys seem neither to notice nor care.TOLSTOYIf the peasants had money, they
           wouldn't surround themselves, as
           we do, with footmen costing ten
           rubles a month.SOFYANo, they'd spend it on drink and
           whores.TOLSTOYValentin Fedorovich, do you think
           fifty years from now, people will
           eat while grown men walk around
           and wait on them hand and foot?19.Valentin doesn't know what to say. A giggle from Dushan.DUSHANOh, that's good...that's good.

Dushan, having sat at table, tries surreptitiously to get
down Tolstoy's words in the diary he holds below the table.
Sofya flushes with anger.VALENTINI think...(sneeze)SOFYAStop scribbling!
              (points to her husband)
          You all think he's Christ, don't
          you? He thinks he's Christ.

There is an awkward pause.DUSHAN(flustered)
          I'm not...I don't believe Leo
          Nikolayevich is Christ. Christ is
          Christ but...SOFYABut what?DUSHANI believe he's one of the
          prophets. God speaks through him.
          I recognize the cadence in his
          voice.SOFYAThis is unbearable. No wonder I
          feel lonely. I'm surrounded by
          morrons.SASHAMama, you're being ridiculous.SOFYAAm I? I sit here and listen to
          this talk of love and God and
          equality, knowing full well that
          Count Generosity here is fully
          prepared to give away everything
          we have.TOLSTOY(exhausted)
          You keep going on like that...Why
          do you think we should profit
          from the work I�m doing which is
          only meant for the sake of the
          people.20.She turns to see Dushan scribbling again.SOFYASTOP IT!   STOP WRITING NOW!Valentin glances at Sasha, uncomfortable at these
outbursts. A long pause. Dushan tries to relieve the
tension.DUSHANIn defense of my gift, let me
          demonstrate. It's quite
          remarkable, really.

He gets up, places a record on the gramophone, needle on
the record. What comes forth is not music, but Tolstoy's
voice.

It is a recording of a recent speech against capital
punishment. His voice booms, tinny and distorted. Dushan
walks to the machine, stares at it in awe. Valentin is
completely caught up in the technology.VALENTINIt's your voice. It's wonderful.

They all listen for a moment, look to Tolstoy for a
response.TOLSTOYIt's tiresome. Another
          remarkable invention will
          supercede it.

Valentin blushes and looks at the table. Dushan tries to
hide his disappointment.TOLSTOYPlease excuse me.

Tolstoy rises, leaves the table, walks out onto the lawn.
Dushan gets up quickly, bumping the table as he goes. Tea
spills. Valentin moves to wipe it up, sneezes, a barrage of
irritable blessings.DUSHANLeo Nikolayevich is something of
          a Luddite, I fear.

Sofya crosses to the machine, removes the record from the
gramophone, replaces it with another Dushan has brought.

Suddenly, the air is filled with   the final duet from
Mozart's Il Nozze di Figaro. She   returns to her place.
There is a long moment where all   take in the sublimity of
it. Tolstoy walks slowly back to   the table. He stands
completely still. Tears fill his   eyes and roll down his
cheeks.21.TOLSTOYOh, that�s better. That�s nice.
                Very nice indeed.

     Sofya crosses to her husband, wipes the tears off his face.
     Valentin watches as they embrace.VALENTIN (O.S.)Do your parents often speak to
                each other so...bluntly?29   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. LIBRARY. EVENING.                      29Across from Tolstoy's writing desk is Sasha's world, a
     makeshift office lined with more bookcases where she does
     her work, sending cables, editing manuscripts, answering
     endless stacks of mail. Valentin sits near her, learning
     the ropes.SASHAMy mother doesn't understand my
                father's goals, not since his
                work as a novelist became
                secondary.    His commitment to
                the spiritual life offends her.
                They've fought about it for
                years.VALENTINI'm sure she means well.

     Sasha just looks at him.VALENTINYour father is the greatest
                writer in the world.SASHAQuite.

     A pause.VALENTINI mean to say, I feel privileged
                to be here. It's an... honor.

     Valentin feels himself slip further into mundanity. Sasha
     goes back to her letter.   Valentin SNEEZES.SASHAGod Bless You.

     They read together for a moment.   He sneezes again.SASHA(irritated)
                God bless you.22.VALENTINI'm sorry. Sometimes I sneeze
               when I'm nervous.

     She regards him like an animal in the zoo. Ivan appears at
     the door.SASHAWhat is it?IVANIt�s a note, for him.

     He nods toward Valentin.SASHAWell, give it to him then.

     Valentin reads the note.VALENTINIt�s from your mother. She wants
               to see me.

     As Valentin goes,SASHAShe is looking for allies. Pay
               attention. This is war.30   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. SITTING ROOM. NIGHT.                   30Sofya is settled on a divan in a small room off the dining
     room. Valentin sits beside her holding a glass of tea.SOFYAI see a fine young man before me.
               Clear eyes. Nice features, rather
               handsome in a peculiar way.VALENTINThank you, Countess...SOFYACall me Sofya Andreyevna. We
               don't stand on formality here, as
               you may have observed.

               Many young men ruin their looks
               by loose living. You're a real
               Tolstoyan, I can tell!VALENTINI admire your husband immensely.SOFYAThat's excellent. He likes that.23.VALENTINHis ideas are beautiful...social
          justice...the idea...Don't you
          think?

Sofya drains her tea cup, signals for more.SOFYAHe's very grateful for the help
          you've been giving him. He told
          me so himself. I think it
          surprises him that a young man
          would be so diligent. When he was
          your age, he was whoring in the
          Caucasus.

Valentin's eyes are wide. She nods.SOFYAHe wrote it all down. He even
          gave me a copy, so I could read
          all the details...VALENTINThank you.SOFYAYou've read War and Peace?VALENTINMany times... twice.

Sofya smiles at his honesty.SOFYAWhen he was writing it, long
          before Chertkov created that
          monstrosity at Telyatinki, before
          all this "new religion" and
          revolutionary nonsense...
              (beat)
          What do you think of Chertkov, by
          the way?VALENTINHe's given me an extraordinary
          opportunity.SOFYABut you see what a fool he is, a
          self-serving puritanical idiot. I
          have to say, it's been extremely
          pleasant since they've locked him
          in his house.

Sofya smiles. Valentin is nonplussed by her directness.24.SOFYAWhen my husband was writing it,
          in the mid-sixties, he'd bring me
          pages to re-copy everyday.
          I was the only one who could read
          his handwriting. I could read his
          intentions, too. Afternoons, we'd
          drink tea and discuss changes.
          "Natasha wouldn't say that to
          Prince Andrey," or "Pierre's too
          simple here. He's not stupid."

She smiles at the memory.SOFYABut I don't count anymore.

Silence. She sips her tea. She glances out the door to see
Sasha hovering nearby. Listening? Sasha walks away.SOFYAYou must help me, Valentin
          Fedorovich. I want only what is
          best for my husband and my
          family. I could tolerate the
          situation if it only concerned me
          What I can not do is sit back
          while they steal my children's
          inheritance. Do you know I was
          the only person. I could
          understand his intention.VALENTINI don't believe anyone wants to
          do that.

Sofya gives him a condescending smile. She produces a
package from the table beside her, hands it to him.SOFYAI have a little gift for you

He opens it, extracts a small leather bound book. He stares
at it.SOFYAIt's a diary.

          you'll write the truth.25.VALENTINThat may not be so easy.SOFYANonsense. You've been listening

     are outside working. There is the ringing of metal on
     wood. He looks for the source. As the way clears a little,
     he sees Masha chopping away with an axe. He stops his horse
     to watch her.MASHAYou're finished for the day?VALENTINHe didn't need me this afternoon.

     He gets down off his horse. Masha continues to chop. He
     picks up an axe, holds it awkwardly.VALENTINLeo Nikolayevich disapproves of
               women doing physical labor.

     begins to chop. He doesn't do it well. Masha smiles at his
     struggle.MASHAHe admires you, I believe.

     What's she saying?MASHASergeyenko told me. He's
               miserable about it.26.VALENTINTolstoy's kind to everyone.

The log is stuck to the blade of his axe. He's really
struggling now.MASHAWhat do you talk about when
          you're with him?
              (beat)
          Why are you blushing?VALENTINWe talk about me.MASHAReally.VALENTINHe wants to know everything about
          me, my parents, my relations with
          women, my experience of god -

He looks up to see Masha smiling at him.MASHAAnd what relations are these?

Valentin blushes, goes back to trying to chopping. Almost
immediately the log becomes stuck to the blade of the axe.
He bangs it, bangs it trying to free it. He glances up to
see her still looking at him. He pounds again and again.

She stops, reaches for his axe, touching him as she does.
She lifts the big axe, log and all, above her head,
bringing it down hard. The log splits. She hands the axe to
him.MASHAI had a lover before I came
          here... headmaster of a school
          where I taught. He was married -
          happily married. It was
          difficult. We could make love
          only at school.

This is somehow more than Valentin had bargained for.VALENTINAt school?MASHAIn the gymnasium, after the girls
          had gone. There were straw mats
          on the floor.VALENTINI see...27.He looks away to hide his confusion.MASHAHave I upset you?

He looks at her.VALENTINNo...I appreciate your franknessMASHABut you disapprove of me. I see
          it in your eyes.VALENTINI don't. Not at all...I think
          sexual activity...how men and
          women combine their physical
          parts is completely neutral.MASHAListen to you. You're a prig.
          Just like Sergeyenko. Why else
          would they have hired you?VALENTINThat's not fairMASHAI don't care if it's fair. It's
          true...neutral...my God...VALENTINI'm going.

He puts down the axe.MASHADo as you like.

She goes back to chopping. We track in front of him as he
walks toward the house. The chopping stops.MASHAValentin Fedorovich.

He stops, relieved and turns to face her.MASHAYou forgot your horse.VALENTINYes. You know, I think that I...
          never mind.

He hesitates for a moment, then starts toward her. Her back
is to him. She begins to chop again. The color rises in his
face as he tries to salvage a little dignity.28.He grabs the reins and starts again toward the buildings,
      trips in a ditch, almost falls flat. Red faced, he rights
      himself. The chopping behind him remains constant.

               That's all very interesting but
               not very useful. I need to know

               are very bright. Too bright to

               Tolstoy's work to the widest
               audience possible. She just has
               no understanding what it is we
               are trying to do. There�s nothing
               in it for any of us but a real
               chance to increase the world�s
               happiness.

     He takes Valentin's hand.CHERTKOVI can only be of limited help to
               the master if I don't know what's
               going on. Any effort she makes to
               shore up control of the

     After a moment, it opens a crack.VALENTINMasha?

     She is there. She puts two fingers to her lips and walks
     toward him. She carries a candle which reveals her short
     hair, her lovely eyes.VALENTINMasha.

     She says nothing, simply crawls into bed, positions her
     knees on either side of him. She leans forward and kisses
     him.VALENTINMasha.MASHASsshh.

     She begins to move against him. Their faces touch. She
     doesn't kiss him, but he can feel her breath. She sits up.MASHAMove the book.VALENITNWhat?MASHAYour book.

     It's true. Valentin still clutches the diary to his chest.
     He puts it aside. Masha, then, pulls her nightdress over
     head, exposing her small breasts, her flat stomach.35.She reaches under the sheets, curls her fingers around him.
     He flinches at the pleasure of it.MASHAIs it alright?

     He can't speak. Only nod. He bites his lip as she slips him
     into her and begins to rock. The pleasure is too much, and
     he comes too quickly. She falls forward on him, begins to
     laugh.VALENTINWhat...what is it?MASHAYou really are a virgin.

     Valentin tenses a little.MASHAI'm playing. It's fine. It's

               five minutes...

     Masha just looks at him.50   EXT. TELYATINKI COMPOUND. DAY.                               50A Tolstoyan photo op. A delegation of orphans have come to
     pay their respects to Tolstoy. He sits in a chair beside
     Chertkov beneath a large banner : "Leo Tolstoy, Friend of
     the People.". Behind him, the disciples lay out a
     vegetarian feast on a plank table. Photographers and a
     cinematographer are strategically positioned to record the
     event.

     Each child gives Tolstoy a flower. Chertkov, in turn, hands
     each child a photograph of the Count giving money to the
     poor.

     Valentin enters, flushed and blushing. He pauses beside
     Dushan who records the scene in his diary, tears in his
     eyes.DUSHANLook at the love in him, like
               Jesus..suffering the
               children...all that...

     Tolstoy greets a little boy affectionately, rubs his
     knuckles over the boy's shaved head. A little girl
     approaches, takes a photograph. He bends forward to kiss
     her head but she pulls away.TOLSTOYAn old man is a very ugly thing.

     Tolstoy sees Valentin, lights up.TOLSTOYMy dear boy. Come and kiss me.

     Valentin, beet red, goes to him. He is warmly embraced.38.TOLSTOYNow, who is this? Maria
          Filipovna.

Masha comes to stand beside him. She glances at Valentin
but he won't make eye contact with her.TOLSTOYYou're both looking so well. Life
          here at Telyatinki obviously
          agrees with you.

Valentin sneezes mightily, moves a little away.TOLSTOYGod bless you, boy. What are you
          nervous about, now? Sit down. Sit
          down.

Valentin takes the chair beside him.TOLSTOYDear Masha, Valentin tells me
          you're the great treasure of
          Telyatinki. He claims you're a
          very gifted teacher.

Sergeyenko lifts an eyebrow "Indeed.". Valentin is in
agony.MASHAWe're happy to have you with us.

Tolstoy notices a mosquito on Valentin's cheek. He takes
the bug between his big fingers, squeezes until it pops.
Chertkov watches in horror, whispers loudly.CHERTKOVWhat are you doing?TOLSTOYWhat do you mean?

He motions to the photographers.CHERTKOVYou've killed a living thing.

Chertkov hears a laugh behind him.   It is Masha who has
over heard the whole thing.CHERTKOVDo you have something to say?MASHAIt's absurd. That's all.

Chertkov is taken aback.   Valentin stares at her.39.VALENTINWhat are you saying?MASHAI'm sorry but- It's a mosquito.TOLSTOYForgive him. He can't help it.
               He's a better Tolstoyan than I
               am.

     She can't help laughing again. Valentin sees the color rise
     in Chertkov's face.CHERTKOVIt's not the message we want to
               send.

     Sasha suddenly appears. She holds a cable in her hand.SASHAFrom my mother "Nerves dreadful.

      him. He twists his neck, thrusts his head upward, crows
      like a rooster.

      He virtually runs to her, embraces her, kisses her. She is
      a giddy girl in his arms. He breaks the embrace and begins
      strutting around the room.SOFYALet me make you sing.

      He takes her in his arms, again, begins to kiss her neck.SOFYADo you love me?TOLSTOYI do.SOFIAI want you to love me.

     A long pause. The clink of soup spoons.   Tolstoy enters.
     He doesn't sit.58.TOLSTOYOur life together has become
          intolerable.

Stifling a sneeze, Valentin gets up to leave,tries to flee
the inappropriateness of all this.SOFYASit down, Valentin.VALENTINReally, I'm expected at
          Telyatinki.

She waves it off.SOFYANo, no, no. Enjoy your dinner.

          than any other married couple.TOLSTOYI didn't come for more

          but-59.He sneezes violently.TOLSTOY/SOFYAGod bless you

Tolstoy turns to Sofya.TOLSTOYHe's right, though. If we cannot
          live a decent, quiet life, if I
          cannot work, if I cannot find
          some peace, I shall simply go
          away.SOFYAGo? Where?TOLSTOYNot to Chertkov, but I shall go.SOFYAGo where?TOLSTOYDushan says you're killing me.

Sofya rises up in cold rage.SOFYAThen go! Go! Anywhere you please!

She smashes a plate on the table to punctuate it and
another and another.SOFYAI hate you. I hate what you've
          become.

She picks up another plate, lets it fall. Now, she acts as
if she's choking or gasping for breath.VALENTINCountess...Are you alright?

She fights with her collar, rips open the front of her
dress.TOLSTOY(shouts)DUSHAN!!!SOFYAYou'll destroy me.

Dushan runs into the room. Sofya continues to tear at her
clothes, stops, begins to pant, then falls to the floor in
a faint.60.VALENTINIs she alright?

     Tolstoy tries to answer, but is overcome by a coughing fit.
     Dushan starts toward him but Tolstoy waves him in the
     direction of Sofya. He kneels beside her.DUSHANSofya! Open your eyes.SOFYAMy back. My back... I'm hurting.DUSHANYou're lying on a fork. Sit up
               and you'll improve
               markedly...Valentin, help to get
               her upstairs, would you?

     Valentin helps Sofya to her feet. Dushan gets up himself
     and walks to Tolstoy.DUSHANShe's alright. I'm more concerned
               for you... We should all go to

     kitchen to see Masha washing the dishes. Exhausted, he
     sits, stares at the floor.VALENTINIt was terrible there today...
               between them. They loved each
               other so much, but you see what
               it becomes.

     She stays at the sink, says nothing.VALENTINMasha, what�s the matter?

     She speaks without turning to him.61.MASHAI'm going back to Moscow.VALENTINWhat?

He gets up, goes to her.MASHAChertkov spoke with me this
          afternoon. He says I could be
          more useful there...which
          means...

Valentin shakes his head. His lip trembles.VALENTINThis is him punishing us,
          punishing me for befriending
          Sofya Andreyevna. For not...
          This is Chertkov.MASHAWe've both disappointed him.VALENTINI don't care. You can't go away.
          I'll talk to him. I'll make him
          change his mind. i�m going to
          make you stay.MASHANo, I want to go.VALENTINWhat?MASHAI'm leaving the movement.VALENTINYou can�t leave Tolstoy.MASHAI am not. Look, when I read his
          Confession, it moved me, Valya.
          He was searching for freedom.
          Freedom from anger. Freedom from
          attachment. Freedom from all the
          superstition and nonsense of the
          church. It moved me so much. I
          thought that's what it would be
          about. Isn't that what it's
          about? Freedom and love? But
          they mix it all up.

Masha reaches out and puts her arms around him. Her head
falls against his shoulder.62.MASHACome with me. Please.

     Bulgakov doesn't know what to say. The silence gets more
     awkward as it gets longer. Slowly, she disengages herself
     from him,looks him in the eye. She nods.MASHAI'm going to my room.

     As she starts away.VALENTINDon't leave me, Masha...
               I need you.

     She turns back for a moment.MASHAI know you do...I know.

     Then she's gone.82   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. SOFYA'S BEDROOM/HALLWAY. DAY.          82Sofya in her bed. A team of doctors hover over her. One of
     them peers into her eyes with a sextant-like instrument.

     We move into the hall to find DR. ROSSOLIMO, an expert in
     mental illness, conferring in the hall with Tolstoy and
     Dushan.ROSSOLIMOI believe the Countess suffers
               from a mental degeneracy,
               paranoic and hysterical, chiefly
               the former.DUSHANYes.

     The doctor walks back into the bedroom. Tolstoy red in the
     face, walks away down the hall. Dushan catches him.TOLSTOYWhy did you bring him here?DUSHANHe's an old friend, you know,
               from Rome.TOLSTOYAnd astoundingly stupid in the
               way of all scientists.

     Dushan is wounded by his uncharacteristic lack of
     generosity.63.TOLSTOYI'm sorry, my friend, but this is
               all very upsetting to me.DUSHANYes.

     Tolstoy sits on a small staircase at the end of the hall.
     Bulgakov is already there on the step above him.TOLSTOYTake them downstairs. Thank them
               for me. Offer them a drink.DUSHANYou'll be alright?TOLSTOYValentin Fedorovich will stay
               with me, won't you, boy

     Valentin nods. Dushan goes to collect the doctors.

     MOMENTS LATER-Tolstoy goes to Sofya's bed. He takes her
     hand. She looks at him with all the love of a new bride.
     Tears come to his eyes. He kisses her hand.SOFYAYa...your...your...I can�t
               remember now...Yo, what did I
               say? What did you mean?TOLSTOYYou rest now.

     Valentin watches from the doorway as Tolstoy leaves the
     bedside and walks out.83   EXT. ZASYEKA WOODS. DAY.                                     83It is an autumn afternoon. Valentin and Tolstoy pick their
     way through the thick undergrowth.

     As they come into a clearing. Valentin is surprised to see
     a portable table and several chairs set up like lawyers
     office in the middle of the wood. Sergeyenko fiddles with a
     piece of paper on the desk. Chertkov comes toward them.

     Tolstoy stops his horse. He turns to Valentin with tears in
     his eyes.TOLSTOYYou see, I no longer feel I have
               a choice in the matter. She
               isn't...

     He rides forward toward the approaching Chertkov.64.CHERTKOVGood afternoon, Leo Nikolayevich.TOLSTOYIs it?

They help Tolstoy dismount. They lead him to a nearby stump
and place the writing board before him. Sergeyenko hands a
document to Chertkov who lays it on the board.CHERTKOVThis will insure that the
          complete works will live in the
          public domain.SERGEYENKOMonumentous.CHERTKOVYour work is the birthright of
          the Russian people. Now, they
          possess it forever.

Tolstoy looks up at them.CHERTKOVYes?TOLSTOYI need a pen.CHERTKOVOf course.

Chertkov looks at Sergeyenko who swallows hard. No pen.SERGEYENKOI...uh...CHERTKOVWhat?

Sergeyenko moves close to Chertkov, close enough to
whisper.CHERTKOVYou're a secretary.       How can you
          not have a pen?

Sergeyenko points at Valentin.SERGEYENKOHe's a secretary, too.      Ask him.CHERTKOVValentin Fedorovich, do you have
          a pen?65.Valentin hesitates for a moment, looks at Tolstoy, seated
     on the stump, staring into the middle distance.VALENTINI do.

     Valentin fetches it from his satchel.

     Pen in hand, Tolstoy hovers over the document. A long
     moment.CHERTKOVAre you alright?TOLSTOYI feel like a conspirator.

     Sergeyenko laughs. Chertkov glares at him. It's beyond
     awkward. Valentin looks to the sky, sees the crows
     circling again.

     Without further hesitation, Tolstoy picks up the pen and
     signs the document. Then he moves away from the group.
     Valentin watches him.84   EXT. ZASYEKA WOODS. DAY.                                      84Valentin and Tolstoy water their horses at a stream.
     Tolstoy seems weary.VALENTINMaybe we should get back. It'll
               be dark soon. May I ask you
               something that has nothing to do
               with work?TOLSTOYOf course, my dear.VALENTINDo you love your wife?TOLSTOY" Your youth and your desire for
               happiness reminds me cruelly of
               my age and the impossibility of
               happiness for me." When I was
               courting Sofya, she was so young
               and pure, it seemed impossible
               that I'd ever have her.
               I didn't want to tell her how I
               felt and I wanted to tell her
               nothing else. So I wrote down a
               string of letters and asked her
               if she could decipher them. She
               looked completely confused,
               thinking it was a game or...66.Tolstoy looks into the middle distance, remembering his
     love.TOLSTOYI gave her one clue. The first
               two Y's, I said, stand for "your
               youth" and then the most
               miraculous thing happened. She
               simply spoke the phrase, my
               phrase...

     Tolstoy looks at Valentin as if the boy might offer some
     explanation of the miraculous.TOLSTOY...as if she had read my mind.
               In that moment, we both knew we
               would always be together. For
               those first years, we were
               incredibly happy, terrifyingly
               happy.

     His old eyes are wet.TOLSTOYAnd now this.

     Tolstoy reaches into his boot, extracts his SECRET DIARY.
     He takes a pen from his shirt, begins to write. Valentin is
     amazed. HE HAD A PEN ALL THE TIME.85   INT. TELYATINKI. MEETING ROOM. NIGHT.                          85Valentin exhausted, sits at the long table.   Chertkov
     appears at his office door.CHERTKOVThank you again, Valentin
               Fedorovich, for your forethought.VALENTINI'm a secretary, after all.

     Chertkov let's it go.CHERTKOVYou know I had thought for a time
               to suggest that Leo Nikolayevich
               look for someone else. But...he
               said no. He said "He reminds me
               of myself when I was young."

     He goes. After a moment, Valentin gets up and goes to the
     study door.VALENTINI'm leaving Telyatinki.67.CHERTKOVReally.VALENTINI am going to Moscow.CHERTKOVShe is leading you around the
               nose.VALENTINLook, you say the movement's
               about love-CHERTKOVYes... The love he tells us to
               practice, the love of the
               Gospels. Why do I have to explain
               this? Perfect love. Eternal love.
               The love that binds mankind
               together.VALENTINBut I've never met mankind, only
               men and women, imperfect men,
               imperfect women.CHERTKOVLeo Nikolayevich also teaches us

     Valentin looks at him for a long moment, then bursts out
     laughing, walks awayCHERTKOVWhy are you laughing? You think
               I'm ridiculous.VALENTINI'm laughing because I didn't

     open before him. Sofya enters without knocking. He bolts up
     groggily, tries to hide the little book. Sofya, meanwhile,
     holds up the letter in her hand.SOFYALyovochka? Prozeveskeny wants to
                purchase the rights to your work

                asked to speak to me.SOFYASplendid...while your wretched
                family is left to starve.TOLSTOYI don't see anyone starving in

                privilege revolts me.

     He goes.   She calls after him.SOFYABut you're always first to the
                trough...always have been.

     Sofya sinks into his chair. On the desk is the photograph
     of herself and Tolstoy that we saw her hang on the wall in
     the early part of the film. She looks at the wall. There
     in it's place is the offending photograph of CHERTKOV that
     she had removed earlier.69.She can fix that. But as she picks up the photo of her and
     her husband, she notices A SMALL VOLUME, THE SECRET DIARY,
     lying under it. She begins to read.90   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. LIBRARY. DAY.                           90Valentin waits on the sofa.   Tolstoy walks in, goes to him.TOLSTOYWhat is it, dear boy? You look
               unhappy. What do you want to

     She turns toward him, waves the gun in his direction.
     Valentin ducks against the wall.SOFYAHow could you do this to me?TOLSTOYYou're not well.SOFYAYou hurt me again and again. You
               take little pieces of me until I

     room. We see the shattered photograph of Chertkov.

     After a moment, Tolstoy into his chair.   Valentin watches
     him in silence.TOLSTOYI'd like you to stay here
               tonight.VALENTINYes, of course.

     No one responds. Dushan comes to Tolstoy, sits down and
     begins the ritual taking of the pulse. Meanwhile, Sasha
     wraps a heavy fur coat around his shoulders. She smiles at

               back to the house.

     They watch as Tolstoy kneels on the wet grass, bending low
     to rub his hands against the earth. After a moment,
     Valentin goes to him, kneels next to him.VALENTINDo you want to go back?TOLSTOYWhen I was a boy, my brother
               Nikolai once brought me to a
               place when I was a boy. He told

               some words on it... the secret to
               happiness for all men everywhere.
               He hid it in the ground. I looked
               for it very often. I've looked
               for it all these years. I really
               believed I would find it
               here...but I never did.72.Tolstoy looks at him.TOLSTOYI never did...but this life is
               behind me now.

     walk back to the droshky.TOLSTOYHelp me up, will you?

     As they go, he hands Valentin an envelope.TOLSTOYGive this to Sofya.VALENTINI will.

     over and over.SASHABe well. Be well.TOLSTOYDon't cry. I'll send for you when
               I can.

     They help him up onto the droshky and the carriage starts
     slowly away from the old house.97   EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. GROUNDS. MORNING                       97Out in front of the house, an old peasant woman pulls the
     feathers off a chicken. Over her impassive face, we hear
     deep, heavy sobs.98   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. SITTING ROOM. DAY.                     98Sofya is in a rage. Sasha sits nearby.SASHAI'm simply telling you what
               happened. He's gone. I have no
               idea where. Nobody does.SOFYAYou're a liar.
                   (beat)
               Liar!

     Sasha won't rise to the bait.

     Valentin comes into the room.73.SOFYASo, he's gone.
                   (to Bulgakov)
               For good.VALENTINI think so, yes.

     There is a pause. Sofya suddenly smiles, becomes
     solicitous.SOFYDarling Sasha, where is your
               father? I know you know. Please,
               please. Don't play games with me.
               Now it�s not the moment.SASHAHonestly, I have no idea.SOFYADON'T PLAY GAMES WITH ME.VALENTINI have this for you.

     It is a letter. She grabs it, as if it is something that
     might feed a terrible hunger at the center of her. Moving
     into a corner, she tears it open and begins to read.

     They both watch Sofya's passion. Her face quivers, the
     muscles in her neck stand out. Her shoulders begin to
     shake.

     Crumbling the paper in her hand, she twists her head and
     screams. Then, gathering up her dress, she runs out the
     door.

     Sasha move immediately to the window. From her P.O.V., we
     see Sofya streaking across the lawn.

     They look at each otherSASHAThe pond!

     They run out.99   EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. GROUNDS. DAY.                         99Sofya sprints away from the house and into the trees. A
     couple of servants join the chase, Ivan and VANYA, a fat
     manservant. Valentin, head of the group, sees Sofya move
     out of the birches. She's heading straight to the pond.74.Sasha suddenly steams past him.SASHAMama, Mama! Stop. Not this.
                Hurry! Hurry!VALENTINCountess!100   EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. POND. DAY                             100Sofya has reached the bathhouse. Peasant women watch her as
      they do their wash. She glances back her pursuers, races
      on.

      Tiring now, she goes to her knees. She crawls along the
      jetty toward the water. At the edge of the jetty, she
      falls on her back then turns over, most ungracefully, and
      rolls off sideways into the pond.



      HIGH ANGLE. Sofya sinks into the black water. The sound of
      her rescuers fades away and is replaced by Tolstoy's voice,
      reading the farewell note she still clutches in her hand.TOLSTOY (V.O.)My position in the house has
                become intolerable. What I'm
                doing now is what people have
                commonly done - leave their
                worldly life behind to spend
                their last days in peace and
                solitude.

      SLOW MOTION She floats, strangely relaxed, beneath the
      water.TOLSTOY (V.O.)I beg you to forgive me for
                everything I've done to you, just
                as I forgive you with all my soul
                for everything you've done to me.

      The silence is suddenly ripped apart by the rescuers. Sasha
      and Valentin jumping into the pond. Sasha, barely able to
      swim herself, thrashes in the water.VALENTINSasha, go back to the jetty.
                Here, let me help you.

      He offers his arm, using it to push her to safety.SASHANo! She's drowning.     Help her!75.VALENTINI will. I will. Stay here.

With that, he pushes away from the dock and makes a sharp
plunge under the water.

Sasha watches, waits...and after a long moment Valentin
surfaces pulling Sofya with him.

On the dock, the servants and Sasha help him to get her
heavy body , water soaked dress, back onto the bank.

She looks terrible. Her tongue lolling out, water drizzling
from her open mouth. Sasha is overcome.SASHAShe's dead. My mother. She's
          dead.

Ivan takes action. He rolls her on to her stomach, works to
expel water from her lungs. This goes on for an agonizing
length of time. Valentin looks to the sky... dull and gray.

Then a sound, coughing sputtering. She is alive. Sasha,
Valentin, and the servants help up.SASHALet me take you to the house,
          mother.SOFYALet me die. Please. Why would
          you rob me of that?SASHALet's go to the house.

Sofya is suddenly clear, almost calm.SOFYAIvan, go to the station. Find out
          which train the master took.

Ivan looks at Sasha for approval.SASHAI see no harm in it. Let's get
          her to bed.

Valentin nods. Ivan appears beside him.IVANLife returns to torture her for
          awhile.

He laughs out loud,then walks away.76.101   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. DINING ROOM. DAY.                      101Sasha walks into dining room. Valentin pours them tea.SASHAShe's exhausted herself. She's
                slept for nearly four hours.VALENTINI'm glad she can sleep. The pain
                subsides a little.SASHAThe noise subsides a little.

      They smile at each other.SASHAWell, a little.

      Ivan comes down the stairs. He stops in the doorway.SASHACome in.IVANA message, miss.SASHAFor me?IVANNo, for your father. From the
                Countess, miss.SASHAShe's allowed to send a note to
                my father. I just don't know
                where to tell her to send it.IVANShe's addressed it to train
                number 9. That's the train the
                master took. The station master
                told me...SASHAWhy are you giving it to me? She
                is allowed to send my father a
                note!

      Ivan steps forward and hands her the note to inspect. Sasha
      can't help but laugh.SASHAShe never gives up.
                    (reading the note)
                "Dearest papa. Return at once.(MORE)77.SASHA (cont'd)

                name.VALENTINIngenious.SASHAObvious.

      She pockets the note. Ivan continues to stand there. Sasha
      looks at him.SASHAYes?IVANHe gave me this as well...the
                stationmaster. A note for you.

      Sasha opens it, reads. She looks up, flushed with
      excitement.SASHAHe's with my aunt.      At the
                Shamardino.

      Sasha runs out of the room.102   EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. GROUNDS. DAY                          102Sasha, on horse back, rides up and by the camera and away

      standing in the doorway. She looks exhausted.VALENTINI'm here.

      She walks to his desk.SOFYAYou're writing to your girl.
                That's lovely.

       Sofya touches his shoulder with real affection, then walks
      across the room to her husband's desk.VALENTINI don't know if she's my girl.78.SOFYABut you believe you'll see her
                 again.VALENTINI very much hope so.SOFYAYes. Refuse to believe in the end

       it.SOFYAI know you know where he is,

      The old man lifts his shirt, takes the thermometer under

      look at each other, wait for the vital signs. He takes the

      blocking the door.SOFYAI want to see my husband.

                Not too weak to see that...

      She gestures in Chertkov's direction. The passion attracts
      more onlookers.CHERTKOVDo you really want to do this
                here?

      She does her best to ignore him.SOFYAI am the leper outside the gate,

Valentin nods.   She tries another tack.SOFYAHave you told him I nearly
          drowned in the pond?SASHAWe didn't have to. It was in all
          the papers.

Sasha goes back toward the door.SOFYAAnd you are a stone-hearted bitch
          of a daughter.

Sasha disappears back inside. Sofya screams after her.88.SOFYAI lost five children. Why
                couldn't one of them have been

      pleasure.CHERTKOVAre you finished?

      A pause. Sofya is suddenly aware of the crowd around her.SOFYAValentin, will you take me back?

      Valentin nods.VALENTINYes, of course.

      Sofya takes his arm, starts back across the platform.
      Shaken, she tries her best to maintain her dignity as she
      walks through the crowd. She leans against Valentin,

      sits at his makeshift desk going through letters and
      cables. He goes to the bedside, stops next to Dushan.
      Silence, interrupted only by Tolstoy's incessant hiccups.
      Valentin notices Dushan is on the verge of tears.VALENTINWhat is it? Dushan, what�s wrong?DUSHANListen to him. I'm supposed to
                be a doctor, for God's sake.

      Weak, feverish, Tolstoy sits up in bed.   Sasha moves to
      help him.TOLSTOYSofya!DUSHANWhat is it? What is it?

      Valentin goes to Tolstoy. He's in a kind of panic. Chertkov
      comes into the room.TOLSTOYShe's come, hasn't she? She`s
                here.

      thrown by a coat rack.CHERTKOVYou're imagining things.DUSHANIt's true, Leo Nikolayevich.TOLSTOYSasha...where's your mother?

      Tolstoy's eyes fill with tears. Valentin looks to Sasha.

      Tolstoy nods, pats Sasha's hand.TOLSTOYVery beautiful isn't it?SASHAOur home?TOLSTOYYes.

      He leans back against the pillow and drifts again. Sasha
      gets up and goes outside. After a moment, Valentin
      follows.135   EXT. ASTAPOVO. STATION MASTER'S HOUSE. DAY                   135Valentin sees her leaning against the wall.   She's in pain.SASHAHe said to me once..."you're like

      through the cables, letters and telegrams that litter the

      overwhelmed at the sight of him. She looks at Valentin, who
      nods at her as if to say go on. Sofya walks past Chertkov
      without acknowledging him. Dushan lets go his hold of
      Tolstoy's wrist and gets out of the chair, out of her way.

Sofya looks around and sits back. Strangely, she does
control herself. She becomes very still. She takes her
husband's hand, begins quietly to speak to him.SOFYAYou don't speak, but I hear you.

seems she feels the slightest of movements, the slightest
squeeze of her hand. She looks down to see Tolstoy open his
eyes. He looks at her for a moment, the hint of a smile,
then closes his eyes again.

Valentin sees it, glances at Sasha.   Then, he begins to
fight for breath.DUSHANFirst cessation.

fights for a last breath.DUSHANSecond cessation.

Sofya whispers quietly to her dying husband.SOFYAPlease forgive me if I cry a

Tolstoy continues to struggle, then silence, silence.

Sasha starts to sob. Sofya reaches out to her daughter.
Sasha comes to her mother who holds her.

She feels someone next to her.   She looks up. It's
Chertkov.CHERTKOVI am sorry, Sofya Andreyevna.

          now on... it will never really
          matter. Not really. Everything's
          finished.

Chertkov sits beside them. She turns to Dushan.SOFYADushan, could you tell them your
          great friend is gone?DUSHANYes.

      As Dushan finishes his tribute, a single voice begins to
      sing the old Russian hymn, Eternal Memory. Gradually, more
      and more of the crowd picks it up. Valentin begins to sing.
      His eyes run over the crowd of mourners. Then, something
      stops the flow of his gaze. His eyes fill with tears.VALENTINMasha...

      Masha. She walks slowly toward him out of the crowd. He
      goes to her, takes her in a long embrace.VALENTINMasha...Masha...I'm so sorry he's

      out of the little house, followed by Andrey, Valentin and
      Dushan carrying Tolstoy's coffin to the train.

      some of them   fall in and walk behind it. The camera travels
      up and up as   the train travels north taking Sofya and her
