                  Some barrier within the younger
                  Bloom was broken.

     During this, Bloom very naturally moves his hand to the small
     of Penelope's back. The edge of his thumb comes to rest on a
     small slit of exposed skin.

     crosses her still face.

                  allergies, hayfever, rashes, really
                  bad. So my mom took me into the
                  doctor, and he did that test where
                  they use needles to prick a grid on
                  your back with all the different
                  toxins, to see which ones you're
                  allergic to. The next day I came
                  in, the doctor lifted up my shirt,
                  and my back looked like a patch of
                  oily, moldy, blackish green double-
                  puff marshmallows. I was allergic
                  to everything. So they sealed the
                  house with plastic and a special
                  ventilation system, and I spent my
                  entire childhood and adolescence
                  indoors. Mostly alone. Lonely.

               of. Then I was going to leave, but
               my mom got sick. So I stayed. And
               she stayed sick, a long time.BLOOMDo you feel cheated?

     Penelope does an amazing card trick using the four queens.PENELOPEThe trick to not feeling cheated is
               to learn how to cheat. So I
               decided this wasn't a story about a
               miserable girl trapped in a house
               that smelled like medical supplies
               wasting her life on a dying person
               she sometimes hated. It was about
               a girl who could find infinite
               beauty in anything, any little
               thing. And do anything she decided
               to do. And love the person she was
               trapped with. So I told myself
               that story until it became true.
               Now did doing that let me escape a
               wasted life, or did it just blind
               me so I wouldn't want to escape it?
               I don't know. But either way, I
               was the one telling my own story.
               So I don't feel cheated.

     She finishes the trick.

     A single pair of hands clapping turns their heads. At the
     far end of the deck, alone at a table, the large man in the
     fur collared cape, who for reasons unlikely to become clear
     at the moment will be called THE CURATOR.THE CURATORAnd a magician is just an actor
               playing the part of a magician.   My

               earlier on the deck.BLOOMI don't know, but he's carrying a

                And one day the boy was walking
                home, and he quarrelled, he fought,
                with a good friend of his. They
                got very angry and his friend
                pushed him a certain way and the
                boy fell and struck his head and
                died. The boy's friend was very
                sad but also very frightened. So
                instead of telling the boy's
                parents, he did something awful.
                He pulled the body into a quarry, a
                pit of broken rocks, and hid the
                boy beneath a pile of large stones.
                Well. Years went by, and the boy's
                friend became a young man, and one

                he heard that a well was being
                built near the forest... with the
                stones from the quarry. He ran to
                the quarry to find it nearly
                empty... no stones, no body. He
                ran to the well where the masons
                were finishing their work. `Did
                they find anything strange in the
                quarry?' he asked, expecting, maybe
                hoping they'd arrest him for the
                awful crime on the spot. But no,
                they said, motioning to the well.
                Nothing strange. Just stones.
                They left him alone there at the
                well, and he stood looking into it
                as the sun fell behind the
                mountains and twilight set the
                world in a deep, still silence.

      The last image we land on is the well, alone in the clearing.

      Its dark innards loom ominously in the long pregnant silence
      that follows.

      Then, with a piercing ROAR, a living monster of stone lunges
      out of the well, animated and terrifying, grabs the friend by
      the throat and with a crunching of bones and one last roar
      pulls him back down into the depths of the well.

      Bloom turns to Stephen and the Chink with a "this is crazy

      off a brick of dynamite, sets it in a petri dish with a
      detonator, and puts the whole thing in a handbag.

      His face falls.

      Then Penelope spots him, points and says something.

      Very suddenly, the police car stops.

      The Chief of Police gets out.       Nods at our intrepid three.

      And opens the door for Penelope. As she climbs out he
      motions for the passing soldiers to stand at attention and
      salute her.

      He kisses her hand.CHIEF OF POLICE(in Czech)

      Penelope pulls the book out from under her jacket and sets it
      on a bench. A moment of victorious silence.

      Clapping her hands, she does a little shuffle dance of joy.

      the elderly vendor with a thin semblance of nonchalance.

      Upsetting a small table. The Chink's pistol, lying on the
      holey paper target, falls and strikes the ground.

      He breathes, closes his eyes.

      An explosion shatters the front passenger window.

      tumbling into the thick forest an instant before the car
      becomes a roiling ball of flame.

      Bloom lies shell-shocked, his vision blurry. He vaguely sees
      Penelope passed out beside him, Stephen on the other side of
      the car.

      A DARK FIGURE comes trotting into the woods, shining a
      flashlight on the charred car. Goes to Stephen. Reaches
      down to him...

      A long black sedan screeches to a halt in the parking lot
      outside the window, Bloom bolts out of the car, pistol ready.

      But the Chink climbs out of the black sedan.PENELOPEWhere does she get all these cars?

      Bloom motions for Penelope to stay back, then goes to meet
      the Chink in the middle of the parking lot.BLOOMIf you know what's happening, now

      for an instant.111206   CONTINUED:                                                     206She gives Penelope a quick little "call me" gesture, picks up
      her case and walks off.

      A truck blocking our view of her car pulls away, and she gets
      in.

      Bloom looks down at the slip of paper.        A short phrase, in

      The engine turns over, and the Chink's car EXPLODES in a
      dramatic fireball.

      The paper flutters out of Blooms's fingers a moment before he
      and Penelope are thrown to the pavement by the shock wave.

      Bloom and Penelope lift their heads, absorbing what just

      The dark figure returns fire on Bloom, who is sprinting full
      on his feet in a large pool of light. A sitting duck.

      Stephen launches himself up, tackling Bloom backwards.

      Just before they fall behind the safety of the flat, a red
      burst of blood flowers from Stephen's left lower back.

      Bloom sets him down gently, and hears heavy footsteps behind
      him.

      He turns, firing, but only sees a blur of dark coat go by,
      through the torn backdrop.

      Bloom runs out on stage, tearing the tarpaulin, and fires
      after the dark figure limping up the aisle and away into the
      lobby.

      Silence.

      Bloom walks back to Stephen, who lies behind the flat,
      breathing heavy. Blood soaking through his shirt.BLOOMPlease tell me this is all gonna be
                 ok. Tell me that's a squib, and
                 that's makeup, and that you just
                 gave me what I always wanted and
                 pulled off the perfect con.

      A long, long moment.

      Stephen coughs, spits.     Then a wry grin spreads across his
      face.STEPHENYou said it, not me.

      He stands, the shakiness gone.

                           STEPHEN (cont'd)
                 Can I get a `wow' for this one?BLOOMYou son of a bitch.122220   CONTINUED: (3)                                            220Bloom looks like he might hit him, but his face breaks and he
      embraces him, crying. The Brothers Bloom stay like that for
      a long while, holding each other in the spotlight's glow.

      Finally Stephen pulls away, tears in his eyes.   He wipes
      them, wipes blood from his lip.STEPHENTastes like tin foil. Alright
                here's what I want you to do. The
                Chink split?BLOOMYeah.   Clean exit.STEPHENHow?BLOOMCar bomb.

      A hint of relief in Stephen's face.STEPHENGood. Here's what. Take Penelope
                back to Helsinki, take that flight
                to Rio. Lay low like we said.
                Play out the on-the-run-from-
                vengeful-Russians thing, that'll be
                fun for her. Play it like I'm
                dead, actually - that'll add some
                gravity to everything, that'll be
                nice. And I'll see you when I see
                you.BLOOMSoon?STEPHENI hope not. Last thing you need is
                me hanging around. Anyway, how
                could I top this?

      Bloom hugs him again.BLOOMI love you. Bye.

      He turns to go.STEPHENHey.    Think of any card.123220   CONTINUED: (4)                                            220Stephen pulls out a pack of cards.BLOOMAlright.

      Stephen cuts, to the Queen of hearts.

                           BLOOM (cont'd)
                 Stephen. That's it.
                     (grins)
                 That's the best card trick I've
                 ever seen. I just wish you had a
                 bigger audience.STEPHENYou're the only audience I've ever
                 needed.

      Wink.   Bloom leaves.

      Stephen watches him go.221   EXT. RUSSIA HIGHWAY - LATE AFTERNOON                      221Rumbling towards Finland.

      In the Bug, Bloom sleeps in Penelope's arm while she drives.

      She looks at his hand on hers, his shirt cuff bright red with
      Stephen's "blood." She strokes his shoulder sadly.

      Off Bloom's sleeping face...222   INT. THEATER STAGE                                        222Stephen pulls a chair out onto the stage, sets it right in
      the spotlight's glare.

      Trembling as if it takes all his last strength in the world.

      Sits.   Looks at the Queen of Hearts, moves his fingers over
      it.

      Then slides is up his sleeve.

      Blood trickles down his hand.124223   INT. BUG - SUNSET                                            223Bloom wakes with a start.PENELOPEHey. Hey, it's ok. The bridge is
                  coming up, we're almost at the
                  border. Were you dreaming about
                  Stephen?

      She strokes his hair back from his face.

      He nods, and looks down at his sleeve.

      Stephen's "blood" on his white cuff.

      Now a dark shade of brown.

      Bloom looks at this shirt.      All the blood, it's all brown.

      He looks up at the road, nearly panicked.

      Maybe a quarter mile ahead is the bridge.BLOOMPull over.     Pull over!!224   EXT. ROADSIDE - SUNSET                                       224She does.

      He bursts out of the car, and run/tumbles down the grassy
      hillside till he finds the car tracks.

      He follows them to the charred remains of the Peugeot.

      Penelope stumbles down after him.PENELOPEWhat is it? You're scaring me-BLOOMWhat did you ask the Russian kid,
                  in the Dog's apartment? He said
                  the Dog isn't here, then what did
                  you ask?

      Bloom kicks open the trunk.      Pries open the blistered attache
      case.125224   CONTINUED:                                                 224Sifts through the charred pile of cinders that was the money
      from the "Russians" till he finds what he was looking for and
      brings it out into the dying light.PENELOPEHow long had he been alone.BLOOMAnd what did he say?

      A scrap of unburned money.    A fragment of Ben Franklin's
      face.PENELOPESince yesterday morning.

      A single eye gazing up at him, the green grass behind it.

      The eye is perfect.    No cross hatching.

      Bloom sinks to his knees.BLOOMThis is real. They hassled you.PENELOPEBloom-BLOOMThe Dog was gone before we got
                   there. They hadn't cleared out of
                   their apartment, they had been
                   cleared out.225   INT. DIAMOND DOG'S APARTMENT - DAY FLASHBACK                 225RUSSIANS in black overcoats burst in, shooting the Dog's men

                   with us, but you haggled with them.
                   You really sold the book to real
                   Russians. The Diamond Dog was
                   gone.126227   EXT. RUSSIA HIGHWAY - FLASHBACK                             227The scene beside the lake, our four heroes checking the money
      in the attache case.STEPHENLet's get the hell out of Russia.

      Bloom tosses the gold lighter, it splashes into the lake.    We
      follow it, plunging beneath the surface.

      Deep deep down, among weak tendrils of light, the Diamond Dog
      sinks into watery blackness, a long blade in his neck.228   EXT. ROADSIDE - SUNSET                                      228BLOOMAnd they came after us.   And

      Penelope holds him tight.PENELOPEI know.BLOOMStephen saved my life.PENELOPEI know.BLOOMHe's gone.

      Bloom folds into Penelope's arms, but she doesn't let him.
      She holds his crying face up.PENELOPEAnd he did it so you could live.
                Your brother loved you. He loved
                you so much. Look at me. Stephen
                said something once, I got the
                feeling he'd rather be telling it
                to you. He said there's no such
                thing as an unwritten life. Just
                badly written ones. I love you.(MORE)127228   CONTINUED:                                                 228PENELOPE (cont'd)

      She holds his face close to hers for a long beat. Then
      smiles and pushes away, launching up the grassy hill.

      Bloom watches her.

      Time slows as she turns back towards him, still running, and
      holds out her hand for him to follow.BLOOM (V.O.)I was thinking of something Stephen
                   said too. "The perfect con is one
                   where everyone involved gets just
                   the thing they wanted." Well.

      He takes the girl's hand, and runs with her towards the point
      of light breaking over the hill.229   EXT. HIGHWAY - SUNSET                                      229Sunset with her wine-red fingers falls over the road ahead.
