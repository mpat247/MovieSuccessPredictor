			about this get-together except you?DELACROIXI wasn't told about this until
			Marie informed me as soon as I got
			off the elevator.

All eyes are on Delacroix and he feels it.DUNWITTYPeople, you can attempt to pull a
			Rodman like our friend Delacroix,
			but I guarantee you'll be sent
			packing just like him.

Dunwitty via remote turns off the lights and turns on an
overhead projector.DUNWITTY (CONT'D)These are the standings.  Read 'em

raises her hand.DUNWITTY (CONT'D)Question?JOANSo what do you want us to do?DUNWITTYWhat I want everyone to do is write
			some material that is FUNNY.  The

move past SLOAN HOPKINS, a highly attractive African-
American "sistuh."

Delacroix sees Sloan and holds her arm as they walk.  He
talks under his breath.SLOANHow was it?DELACROIXWhy didn't you tell me about this
			staff meeting?SLOANNobody told me anything.DELACROIXWhat good are you if you don't tell
			me stuff like this?SLOANIt wasn't my fault.  If I would
			have known, I would have known.INT. DUNWITTY'S OFFICE - MORNINGDelacroix enters his corner office, which has huge action
photos of ALI, JORDAN, GRIFFEY, TYSON, AARON and JABBAR on
his walls, it is also decorated with African art throughout.ANGLE ONOffice.  Dunwitty looks at the floor-to-ceiling windows
overlooking mid-town Manhattan.DUNWITTYDo you know what C.P. Time is?DELACROIXC.P. Time is Colored People's Time.
			The stereotypical belief that
			Negroes are always late.  That
			Negroes have no sense of time -
			time except when it comes to music
			or dance.

They both laugh.DUNWITTYLet's sit down over there.9.Dunwitty and Delacroix sit on the sofa.DUNWITTY (CONT'D)I'm sorry about my blowup but I
			have to have a whipping boy every
			meeting.DELACROIXI understand.  But again, in all
			honesty I was not informed.DUNWITTYForget it.  I believe you're my
			most creative person I've got on
			staff.  You're hip.  You know
			what's happening.  I got some corny
			white boys and girls writing for me.

Delacroix doesn't join him in his laughter because he
doesn't know how to take that comment or where Dunwitty is
headed with it.DUNWITTY (CONT'D)I understand Black culture.  I grew
			up around black people all my life.
			If the truth be told I probably
			know "niggers" better than you,
			Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't
			get offended by my use of the
			quote-unquote N word.  I got a
			black wife and three bi-racial
			children, so I feel I have a right
			to use that word.  I don't give a
			damn what Spike says, Tarantino is
			right.  Nigger is just a word.  If
			Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every
			other word so can I.DELACROIXI would prefer you not use that
			word in my presence.DUNWITTYNIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.Delacroix pounces on top of Dunwitty like a cat on a mouse
and gives him a quick BROOKLYN BEAT DOWN.DELACROIXSay it again.  C'mon, say it again.CLOSE ONDunwitty.  He's a bloody pulp.10.CLOSE ONDelacroix.

He straightens his tie.DELACROIX (CONT'D)Who's a nigger now?

POW.  This is a fantasy in Delacroix's mind.  We go BACK TO
REALITY.  Everything's how we left it.DUNWITTYThe material you've been creating
			is too white bread.  White people
			with black faces.  The Huxtable's,
			Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's
			dead.  We can't go down that road
			again.DELACROIXI don't agree.  The Negro middle
			class does exist, and it's rich
			material for a dramatic series or
			sitcom.DUNWITTYI'm telling you it's not.

He goes to his desk, picks up Delacroix's scripts and starts
throwing them one by one against the window.DUNWITTY (CONT'D)The middle class black family moves
			into a white suburban enclave.  The
			middle class black family moves
			into a small Southern town that is
			run by the KKK.  The middle class
			single black father raises his
			teenage daughter.  The middle class
			single black father raises his
			teenage daughter.  The middle class
			single black mother raises her
			teenage son.  And so on and so
			forth.  It's too clean, too
			antiseptic...DELACROIX...to white?  I still feel all of
			my scripts would make good shows.11.DUNWITTYDelacroix, wake up, brother man.
			The reason why they didn't get
			picked up was because nobody - and
			I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers
			alike wants to see that junk.DELACROIXI've never been given a fair shot.DUNWITTYYou got your head stuck up your ass
			with your Harvard education and
			your pretentious ways.  Brother
			man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm
			keepin' it real and you're frontin',
			trying to be white.DELACROIXI'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I
			don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROMOUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OFDESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as
			you might put it, some "nigger"
			show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than
			white and you're blacker than black?
			Is that what you think?DUNWITTYThat's exactly what I think.  I
			want you to create something that
			people want to see.  Let's be
			honest, the majority of the people
			in the country are deaf, dumb and
			blind and I'm including 35 million
			African-Americans.  You know and I
			know "niggers" set the trend, set
			the styles.  This is a golden
			opportunity now.  These idiots have
			to be led to the water.DELACROIXI'm not sure if I can deliver what
			you want.DUNWITTYYou will or you'll be back at BET
			so quick you'll never know what hit
			you.  I need a mid-season
			replacement and pronto.  It will be
			on the fast track.12.DELACROIXWhat is it you want from me?  Some
			plantation follies?  Some sitcom
			that takes place on a watermelon
			patch?  Some show that follows four
			nigger generations of junkies and
			crackheads?  You want me to go back
			to the ante bellum days?DUNWITTYYes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show
			that will make headlines, that will
			have millions and millions of
			households tuned in, glued to their
			televisions every week.  I want
			advertisers dying to buy on this

			let me introduce you to everybody.
			You know my assistant, Sloan.28.SLOANHello.DELACROIXThis is Cheeba.CHEEBANice to meet you.DELACROIXAnd this is Manray.MANRAYHow do you do?DUNWITTYGood.  I like the names.  Very
			theatrical.DELACROIXWe're all happy to be here and I'm
			going to paint a picture for you.DUNWITTYI'm wid it.DELACROIXI've done a lot of soul searching
			and once again you are right.  In
			my previous work it's been all
			surface, superficial.  I have never
			really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As
			Mark Twain fully understood satire
			is the way.  Race has always been a
			hot button in this country's
			history and it needs to be pushed
			harder.  If we are ever to live
			side by side in peace and harmony.
			It's about promoting racial healing.DUNWITTYGo on.  Good so far.DELACROIXI know you're familiar with minstrel
			shows.  They came about at the turn
			of the 19th century.  It was a
			variety show in which the talent
			was in blackface - singing, dancing,
			telling jokes, doing skits.
			Dunwitty, I ask you when was the
			last time there was a good variety
			show on the air.  Carol Burnett?
			HeeHaw?29.DUNWITTYWord!!!DELACROIXSo let's take this great form, this
			very American tradition of
			entertainment into the 21st century,
			into the new millennium.DUNWITTYThe name of the show?DELACROIXIt is called: MANTAN - THE NEWMILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.DUNWITTYI'm lovin' it.  You know how I know?
			Because I'm getting a boner, my
			Johnson is hard, no disrespect my
			sister.

Dunwitty starts walking around his office, pumping his first.DUNWITTY (CONT'D)I'm feelin' dis'!DELACROIXIt will take a lot of courage and

			get this on the air.  In fact, I
			would understand fully if the
			subject matter is deemed too
			risque, too controversial.DUNWITTYDon't worry about that, that's my
			department.  Now who do we cast?
			We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or
			dance?DELACROIXI don't know if Whoopi is the way

Sloan looks at Delacroix with concern.DELACROIXEvery week we follow the trials and
			tribulations of two real coons -
			Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky
			Duo.DUNWITTYWhat are there character traits?DELACROIXIgnorant, dullwitted, lazy, and
			unlucky.DUNWITTYExactly!DELACROIXMantan is an uneducated Negro who
			always by some stroke of
			unbelievable stupidity makes his
			best laid plans go haywire.DUNWITTYAnd Sleep 'n Eat is his comical
			sidekick?DELACROIXYep, you guessed it.DUNWITTYThis could be bigger than "Amos and
			Andy."31.DELACROIXProtest finally forced "Amos and
			Andy" off the air.  Could stop us
			from ever getting on.DUNWITTYLet'em try.  I will kill to make
			this happen.

Delacroix looks at Sloan.DELACROIXNegroes would be in an uproar.DUNWITTYSo what.  We would just give the
			NAACP a donation that would be the
			end of that.  No such thing as bad

			said singing and dancing.DELACROIXMantan right here is a gifted
			hoofer.  He has educated feet.DUNWITTYWho are the other characters?DELACROIXDo we have characters?  How about

Dunwitty is dying with laughter.  He's the only one.DUNWITTYWe gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY

			I didn't grow up on food stamps and

			One misstep and we're doing "Amos

			Negroes?DUNWITTYProbably nuthin', but that's why
			it's such a sexy way to go.
			Sometimes an outsider has a fresh

			perspective.  A black director,
			y'know what he's gonna do given the

			possibilities are endless.DELACROIXWhat are his qualifications besides
			being a white male and directing a
			hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?DUNWITTYIf Spielburg can direct "The Color
			Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid
			can direct the Mantan pilot.DELACROIXThat's exactly my point.  Has he
			even directed actors before in
			anything?DUNWITTYNo!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's
			all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even

			Let's get right into it.  You have

			a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom.
			Why does your show generate such
			feelings?DELACROIXBecause race has always been a
			sensitive issue in this country.
			Gary, I have no problem with people
			disagreeing with the show, it's
			when folks start trying to mess
			with my inherent right as an
			artist, that's when I get mad.  No
			one, in any way, shape or form
			should be censored.GARY BYRDNo matter how sexist or racist the
			material may be?DELACROIXYes.  And I say yes because who is
			to judge?  Who is to stand before
			us and say this is righteous and
			this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?GARY BYRDBut the line has to be drawn.DELACROIXDon't you people get it?  We're in
			the 21st Century.  Slavery was over
			four hundred years ago.  All that
			stuff people talked in the old
			days, it's over.  Folks always
			crying, white man this, white man
			that.  Let's all grow up.GARY BYRDAre you trying to excuse our

			of your Negroes just like my Aunt
			Sister.  Face up to it.  The world
