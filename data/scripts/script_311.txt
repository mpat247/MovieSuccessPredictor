               of TAXIDERMY TOOLS. Long surgical TWEEZERS taken. A steady
               HAND grasps a CLAY BIRD FORM. Then sets the second eye.
               Unhurried. Meticulous.

               A MYSTERY MAN, features obscured, sets the tweezers aside,
               reaches for a black lump on the table, revealed to be shiny
               feathers as he wraps it around the form. Adjusts it so the
               glass eyes peer out through holes in the skin of this large
               CROW. A taxidermy specimen.

               WIDE, the man works across the room under the pooled light
               of a draftsman's lamp, the Crow on the table in front of

               of PROTESTERS and GAWKERS. A POSTCARD at first, then signs
               of movement--handheld placards and flickering candles
               telegraph an imminent execution.

               The group shifts amoeba like as... A LARGE MERCEDES

                         and Alex were meant for each other.

               REVEAL... Erin is writing the journal, but she's a radically
               transformed wild child.

               A shock of vividly colored dreadlocks, some of the holes
               that stitched her mouth shut kept permanently open by studs.ERIN'S VOICE (CONT'D)That they're together now. Fighters.
                         United by love. And anger. That
                         they've given also to me.

               She's leaning up against a new headstone.

               "Alex Corvis 1981-1999 Always With Us."ERINI love Alex. As my sister always
                         hoped I would. And I love Lauren.
                         And I know, because of this, that
                         love does not die. I'm alive.
                         Thinking of them. Hoping that,
                         sometimes, they're thinking of me.

               Erin stops writing, closes the journal, stands. She takes
               the Locket off her neck, drapes it over Alex's headstone,
               like the one already over Lauren's.

               She stares at the two a moment, then puts her index finger
               to her lips, transfers kisses to the two stones. And leaves.

               THE END
