               inexplicable reasons the heart has,

               I had a dream where he came to me
               and brought me a little gift -
               earrings they were - and we made
               love. perhaps it is just as well I
               accept Hemingway's offer to go to

               not moody and selfish like Pablo or
               Amedeo was. I think a trip to

                    will I - I'm beginning to see why
                    it can't work, Adriana. The
                    present has a hold on you because
                    it's your present and while there's
                    never any progress in the most
                    important things, you get to
                    appreciate - what little progress
                    is made - the internet - Pepto-
                    Bismol. The present is always
                    going to seem unsatisfying because
                    life itself is unsatisfying -
                    that's why Gauguin goes back and
                    forth between Paris and Tahiti,
                    searching - it's my job as a writer
                    to try and come up with reasons why
                    despite life being tragic and
                    unsatisfying, it's still worth it.ADRIANAThat's the problem with writers -
                    you're all so full of words - but
                    I'm more emotional. I'm going to
                    stay and live in Paris' most
                    glorious time. You made a choice
                    to leave Paris once and you
                    regretted it.GILYes, that one I regretted but it
                    was a real choice and I made the
                    wrong one. This is a choice
