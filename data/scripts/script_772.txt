               inexplicable reasons the heart has,

               As always in this sad life he is

               I had a dream where he came to me
               and brought me a little gift -
               earrings they were - and we made
               love. perhaps it is just as well I
               accept Hemingway's offer to go to
               Africa. Life with Pablo is too
               full of conflict and I am

               I need to go from one brilliant man
               to another is my weakness. Gil is
               different, perhaps not a genius but
               not moody and selfish like Pablo or
               Amedeo was. I think a trip to

                    important things, you get to

                    is made - the internet - Pepto-
                    Bismol. The present is always
                    going to seem unsatisfying because
                    life itself is unsatisfying -
                    that's why Gauguin goes back and
                    forth between Paris and Tahiti,

                    unsatisfying, it's still worth it.ADRIANAThat's the problem with writers -
                    you're all so full of words - but

                    to leave Paris once and you
                    regretted it.GILYes, that one I regretted but it
                    was a real choice and I made the
                    wrong one. This is a choice
