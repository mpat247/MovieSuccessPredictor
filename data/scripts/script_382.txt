the highway in front of the third.INT. THIRD TRUCK (HIGHWAY, DESERT) - NIGHTSELF-HELP TAPE (V.O.)I will not fear the unexpected.PIG PENI will not fear the unexpected.

The rabbit appears in the road, frozen by headlights.PIG PENAhhhhhhhhhh!

Pig Pen jams on his brakes and swerves to avoid the
bunny.EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHTThe truck slews crazily.    Missing the bunny by a whisker.2.INT. THIRD TRUCK (BRIDGE, DESERT) - NIGHTPig Pen sees a bridge ahead. If he doesn't regain
control, he will crash. At the last second, he gets the
rig together.EXT. BRIDGE (DESERT) - THIRD TRUCK - NIGHTThe rim of a wheel tags the curb. One of those toxic
waste barrels falls out of the back and plunges to the
water below.EXT. DRAINAGE DITCH - NIGHTA biohazard warning label is legible as the barrel slips
beneath the surface. Glowing toxic waste seeps from a
gash in its side. Spreading through the pool like neon
ink.EXT. DRAINAGE DITCH - DAYThe ditch is littered with garbage. The DRONE of
INSECTS. No visible traces of toxic waste. A butterfly
net sweeps through the air to capture an oversized
horsefly.

JOSHUA TAFT (70s), scrutinizes the bug. This old codger
is more comfortable studying bugs than socializing with
people.JOSHUAHey, Mike.   Check this one out.

MIKE PALMER (12) steps over for a look.     Puberty hit hard
and fast for this bright, little nerd.MIKEHe's huge!JOSHUAThey've been like this all week.
          Must be something extra tasty in
          the water.MIKELike what?JOSHUADead coyote. Snake maybe. Back
          in the 'Nam we'd eat python with a
          dash of habanero sauce. Mighty
          satisfying.(CONTINUED)3.CONTINUED:MIKEYou ate snake?JOSHUAWhen you're thirty klicks out from
             the nearest firebase. Humpin'
             through the wake-up with your
             finger on the trigger. Charlie
             doesn't give you time to stop for
             cutlet.

As Mike skims his own net over the water, he glimpses a
familiar barrel at the bottom of the pool. The brightly-
colored biohazard warning label is clearly visible.EXT. ROAD - JOSHUA'S HOUSE - DAYTwo bicycles are parked outside a cabin in the middle of
nowhere.INT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE - DAYThe decor is an odd mix of Vietnam era war relics and
homegrown scientist. Charlie the Parrot sits on a perch.CHARLIE (V.O.)Charlie, don't surf!JOSHUAQuiet, bird.     We're working.

Mike and Joshua stand near the spider tanks. A dozen
aquariums on low shelves. Each glass tank replicates a
specific environment: jungle, desert, cavern, pond, etc.JOSHUA(dims tank lights)
             The sun is going down, my
             nocturnal hunters. It's time to
             come out and feed.

Mike watches Joshua deposit bugs into each spider tank.MIKEYeah. They're definitely getting
             bigger.JOSHUAI've calculated a growth factor of
             twelve percent over the last
             forty-eight hours. But that seems
             to be accelerating.(CONTINUED)4.CONTINUED:MIKEAll from eating these bugs?   Maybe
             I should try some.

Mike pauses at the desert tank, watching a cricket search
for food. A trap-door spider pops out of its camouflaged
den like a jack-in-the-box. The arachnid yanks the
cricket below and replaces the roof in a nanosecond.

Mike looks in another tank where ogre-eyed spitting
spiders shoot blasts of paralyzing goo at hapless
insects.MIKERun, little guys.JOSHUAThey can't outrun the food chain.MIKEI could get away.JOSHUAImagine yourself the size of that
             fly. A scytodes spitter would be
             as big as a Cadillac. You'd be
             spider chow, kid.

Mike looks in a tank where jumpers chase fleeing
crickets. He moves toward another tank that is covered
with a towel.MIKEAre the new tarantulas in here?JOSHUATook me forever to get a breeding
             set of Chilean reds. I must have
             bribed every customs agent from
             Vegas to Santiago.

Joshua unveils the    tank. Dirt floor. Several burrow
entrances. Joshua     pours in the bugs. A large, male
tarantula comes out    of a burrow. It pounces on a bug,
then wraps its prey    in webbing, turning the insect into a
mummy-like bundle.MIKEThat is too cool.JOSHUAMale tarantulas compete for the
             female's attention.(MORE)(CONTINUED)5.CONTINUED:JOSHUA (CONT'D)Each one tries to bring her the
             best present. Bugs, rats, even
             the occasional parrot.CHARLIE SQUAWKS.JOSHUAThe prey is cocooned alive so she
             can eat them in her nest. You
             know how women love breakfast in
             bed.

Joshua leads Mike to the back of the tank. A network of
subterranean tunnels is revealed. The male tarantulas
scuttle through carrying their mummified offerings.JOSHUATake a look, the female of the
             species is three times as big as
             the male.

Mike peers into a large den. The female tarantula steps
out of the shadows. This is Consuela, the Chilean red
tarantula.JOSHUASay hello to Consuela.

Mike watches Consuela unwrap one of the mummified
bundles. She begins to eat the paralyzed insect within.JOSHUAShe fills her prey with digestive
             acid to liquify the internal
             organs. Now watch... She'll drink
             her victim from the inside out.
             While it's still alive!MIKE(looks queasy)
             And you wonder why my mom doesn't
             like me hanging out with you.JOSHUAArachnids have been roaming the
             earth for millions of years. And
             they'll be here long after the
             human race is dead and buried.

Suddenly Consuela lunges at the glass.     Mike recoils.MIKEBad!   Bad Consuela!

Consuela backs up, apparently she can be intimidated.6.TARANTULA POV - MIKEThe multi-eyed spider's PANORAMIC VISION. Mike looms
large at the edge of the glass, wagging his finger.BACK TO MIKEMike stares into the many eyes of Consuela.MIKEDo that again and I feed you to
          the parrot.

CHARLIE SQUAWKS hungrily.    The sound of a CAR HORN.JOSHUAThere's your mom.MIKESee you tomorrow, Joshua!

Mike heads for the door.EXT. DESERT - DAYThe entrance to a mine shaft protrudes from a hillside.
A pickup truck is parked nearby. The faded logo on the
door reads: McCORMICK AND SON MINING COMPANY,PROSPERITY, NV.INT. MINE SHAFT - DAYRotten beams. Chipped walls. A GENERATOR POWERS a
string of lightbulbs. A lone figure works at the end of
the tunnel.

CHRIS McCORMICK (30s) has rugged good looks. Weathered
clothing. Dirt-stained face. Ripped muscles.

Chris chips at the wall with his pickaxe. As it makes
contact, the occasional spark flies up. Chris pauses to
scrutinize the target area with his helmet-light.

Something sneaks along the floor of the mine behind him.

Chris is oblivious to his unseen stalker. He chips away
a section of stone to reveal shiny minerals. Reflections
of silver and gold splash across his face. His smile
fades...CHRISDamn.(CONTINUED)7.CONTINUED:Chris bends over, reaching for a bottle of water. A
large rat scurries out of hiding dragging away Chris's
sack lunch.

Chris grabs his pick-axe and goes after the rat. The
rodent dodges every hit. Sparks fly when the axe strikes
rock. These ignite a vent of methane gas.

A BRIEF EXPLOSION knocks Chris off his feet. He notices
a small hole in the floor is lit like the burner on a
stove. Chris pats out the flame as the rat scurries away
with lunch.CHRISHope you like bologna!EXT. HIGHWAY - DAYA police car drives with a bicycle hanging out of the
trunk.INT. POLICE CAR (HIGHWAY) - DAYSAMANTHA "SAM" PALMER (30s) is the sheriff of Prosperity
and a confident, single mother. Mike is seated beside

             The   spitters fire poisonous snot.
             The   tarantulas mummify their prey.
             The   jumpers can...SAMWhy does he have all those things?MIKEHe studies them. NASA uses spider
             webs in outer space. And for
             medicine. They've been here
             forever, and they'll be here long
             after we're all dead.SAMYou're givin' me nightmares.MIKENightmares are cool.(CONTINUED)8.CONTINUED:SAMU.P.S. brought this to the
             station.

Sam hands Mike a small package.MIKEIt's from Dad! He didn't forget
             my birthday. I told you he
             wouldn't.SAMBetter late than never.

Mike tears open the box to reveal a Cassiopeia PDA.MIKERockin'!SAMIs that the one you wanted?MIKECassiopeia 2304 with 64 megs of
             ram. Integrated modem. Voice
             recording capability. This baby
             is tight.

Mike can't turn on the gizmo.SAMWhat's wrong?MIKEHe forgot to send the batteries.SAM(annoyed)
             I told him to send batteries.EXT. DESERT - DAYThe ROAR of two off-road MOTORCYCLES tearing up the
desert.

BRET HALE (18) leads the way. A Kid Rock-punk with good
looks and FU attitude. Seated behind him is ASHLEY
PALMER (16). This milk-fed desert honey is a wannabe
Britney Spears. LARRY (17) is the wiseacre on the other
bike.BRETHang on, babydoll!(CONTINUED)9.CONTINUED:They GUN their BIKES onto the highway. Slalom the yellow
lines. Wheelie for days. Ashley peeks over Bret's
shoulder at a police car coming at them in the opposite
lane.ASHLEYOh shit.INT. POLICE CAR (HIGHWAY) - DAYSheriff Sam watches intently as the bikes wheelie past.SAMHang on.MIKEWhy?EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - DAYThe police car does an impressive bootlegger 180. Lights

voice barks over the PA.SAM (V.O.)Party's over, gentlemen.   Off the

Sam exits the car and approaches.       The bikers dismount.BRETThere is something very sexy about
             an older woman in uniform.LARRYHer nine-millimeter gives me a
             stiffy.ASHLEYDon't antagonize her, you guys.SAMI told you not to act like
             kamikazes. Especially with Ashley
             riding behind. That is
             unacceptable, Bret.(CONTINUED)10.CONTINUED:BRETI could always ride her from
             behind.

Larry snickers.     Sam steels her rage.SAMYou just bought yourself a
             reckless.

Sam begins to write up the ticket.ASHLEYCan't you give 'em a break?SAMGet in the car, Ashley.       Now.ASHLEYBut, Mom!

Sam shoots his daughter an intimidating glance.BRETNo sweat, babydoll.       We'll hook up

             daughter's life in danger, I'll
             show you exactly how little that
             means to me.

Bret and Larry feel her resolve.BRETRelax, bee-otch. It's all good.

The punks REV their BIKES and defiantly wheelie toward
town.INT. POLICE CAR - DAYSam climbs behind the wheel.MIKEI read her her rights.SAMI can always count on you, Mike.

Sam STARTS the CAR and drives toward town.ASHLEYDo you get off on humiliating me?SAMThis bad girl act doesn't suit
             you, Ash.ASHLEYI'm just trying to have fun.
             Don't you remember what it's like
             to grow up here?SAMThat's what scares me.(CONTINUED)12.CONTINUED:Sam reaches over and opens the glove box. She pulls out
a stun gun. Mike passes it through the bars to Ashley.SAMI told you to keep this with you.

Ashley slides the zapper into her backpack.ASHLEYYou are so over protective.

Mike and Ashley lip-sync along with Sam's response.SAMA mother's job is to protect her
             children.ASHLEYYou need to start trusting me.SAMI'd like to. But you keep
             skipping classes to go to the
             dunes with Bret.ASHLEYWhy do you hate him so much?SAMI don't hate him. I just want you
             to have a future. I thought you
             wanted to get out of town. Go to
             med school.ASHLEYMaybe I want to stay. I could get
             pregnant by nineteen. Then
             divorce with a couple of kids I
             can't handle. Slap on a badge and
             be a trailer trash sheriff.SAM(deeply hurt)
             Thanks for the flashback.

          And Prosperity is lucky enough to
          be on that list.HARLAN (V.O.)Lucky? I think most of us are

          dump toxic waste.CHRISRight on.EXT. MAIN STREET (TOWN) - DAYChris's pickup approaches... The entire town is not much

          rich quick scheme?

outlet stores inside: Victoria's Secret, Home and Garden
Supplies, Sport Chalet, etc. Hand-painted signs reveal:"GOING OUT OF BUSINESS SALE. EVERYTHING MUST GO. FINALCLOSE OUT." On the roof of the mall is a very tall radio

          dream?INT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - DAYWADEThink about it, Harlan, you could
          buy a commercial transmitter and
          start broadcasting to a national

GLADYS LAUDERBACK (50s) sits at a desk. She blows smoke
from her Kool into the breeze of an air conditioner.
Ignoring the signs behind her head: "NO SMOKING!","DANGER GAS!"As Chris enters, Gladys hides her lit cigarette in a
drawer.GLADYSDid you pop him one?CHRISHe had it comin'. But Sam
             Palmer... That woman abuses her
             power.GLADYSWhy? Because she stopped you from
             givin' Wade another pop?CHRISI'm not proud of it.

Chris goes to a table and a map of the mines that
honeycomb beneath the town. Many of them are marked
"explored." Many aren't. Chris checks another tunnel
off the list. He sniffs the air and glares at Gladys.
Smoke rises out of her desk drawer. Gladys yanks it open
and puts out the flame.(CONTINUED)21.CONTINUED:CHRISI thought you were trying the
             patch.GLADYSI am.

She raises her sleeve to reveal several nicotine patches.

odd CLICKING. He tracks the sound to a stove burner
permanently on "light."

Chris moves to a fuse box in the adjacent hallway. He
removes the fuse for the stove. The SPARKING STOPS.

Chris sits at the table and has a cooling sip of beer.

             don't think he cared    how that
             happened. If he was     still alive,
             maybe he'd sell those    mines.

Chris takes umbrage...CHRISAnd maybe you didn't know him so
             well after all.

A tense beat.GLADYSYou're right... I'm just worried
             about how we're going to pay these
             bills.CHRISDon't give up on me, Gladys. I
             promised him I'd find the gold.

          time.

Joshua doesn't look back at the parrot sitting on its
perch.JOSHUABe quiet, bird!

Charlie looks over at the tarantula tank. Watching
curiously as the cloth cover moves slightly. As if one
of the spiders is escaping. Charlie flies over to
investigate. He lands on the counter and peers around
the back of the tank.CHARLIECharlie's in the wire!     Incoming!

Something yanks the parrot O.S.JOSHUAStop screwing around...!

Joshua looks back in search of the parrot. He notices
several feathers floating down to the floor. He heads
over to investigate. Joshua pulls the blanket clear to
reveal the top of the cage has been pushed aside. No
sign of any tarantulas. Joshua checks the back side of
the tank.JOSHUAWhere'd you go? Consuela?

She's nowhere to be seen. Joshua spots      something
sticking out from under the table. Two      parrot feet.
Joshua pulls Charlie out from under the     table. It's a
horrible sight. The bird is wrapped in      spider webbing.
His body desiccated.(CONTINUED)24.CONTINUED:JOSHUACharlie... Semper fidelis.

in.INT. BATHROOM - SHOWER - DAYAshley is surrounded by steam. She sings an edgy gangsta
rap tune by NWA. Tres' bizarre, non? Shampoo lather
cascades down her face. Her eyes close. She is
oblivious to a small spider crossing a web in front of
her. The spider gets clear as Ashley rinses off the
soap.

Ashley rubs conditioner into her hair. The lather
builds. Covering her face. Forcing her eyes closed once
more. The spider returns across its web right in front
of her eyes.

The water stops. Ashley reaches for the showerhead
blindly knocking the spider off its web. She feels no
water coming out, and fumbles for a washcloth. Reaching
with eyes closed, she can't see the little spider has
landed on top of the cloth. As Ashley retrieves it, the
spider scurries onto its opposite side.

Ashley wipes the soap off her face. The spider rides the
washcloth and moves toward her hand. Before it can
strike, Ashley gets her eyes clear and drops the cloth.

The cloth lands on the floor atop the spider. As the
beast stares out from under it, barefoot Ashley steps on
the cloth. Crushing the spider without ever knowing it
was there.(CONTINUED)26.CONTINUED:Ashley turns her attention to the showerhead. She cranks
the water handles, trying to get the water flowing again.
The handles suddenly pop off. Dozens of tiny spiders
pour from the holes onto the floor. Ashley shrieks in
horror.

Sam bursts into the bathroom and yanks open the shower
door. She drags Ashley out and looks at all the little
spiders.SAMNow what?

Ashley just screams.INT. HANK AND EMMA'S HOME - DAYThe SCREAM of a SAWZALL. A house in the midst of
remodeling. Sections of wall are exposed. Sheets cover
furniture. HANK (30s) is the Bob Villa-poseur.

A cat sits near an open section of wall. Watching
something intently. The cat charges into the wall after
unseen prey.

EMMA (30s) comes downstairs wearing her bathrobe. She
clutches her ears in pain, screaming for Hank to stop.
He can't hear. She grabs his shoulder and he STOPSCUTTING.EMMAWhy do you need to do that as six

coming from behind a partially-dismantled wall.HANKHey, Zeke.   Breakfast is ready.EMMAI'll get the tuna.

inside.HANKZeke?

Emma re-enters with a can of tuna.       She hears ZEKE HISS.EMMAWhat's wrong with him?

Hank shakes his head. The CAT noises become more
aggressive. The panicked couple tries to follow the

Mike walks away, deeper into the mall. A dozen stores
line the hallway: Victoria's Secret, Electronic

remaining cans of Raid, Black Flag and Off.EXT. BEVERLY'S HOUSE (TOWN) - DAYBeverly uncoils a hose, cranks a spigot. She sprays her
vegetable garden with water. After a beat, a solid
object is coughed up through the hose.

Beverly continues watering. Two more unidentified
objects are spewed from the hose. She reacts by cranking
the spigot on full. The water sprays harder. Then
inexplicably stops.

Beverly checks the spigot. She looks into the opening of
the hose. Puts it to her ear and listens. Sniffs. Now
she puts the end of the hose in her mouth and sucks
deeply, trying to siphon away the blockage.

Beverly removes the hose. A FAINT RUMBLING sound. She
puts it back in her mouth and sucks. A solid object
comes through the hose and into her mouth. Then another.
And another. A dozen things pump through the hose and
into her mouth.

Beverly yanks it out. Water spews from her mouth and out
of the hose. Apparently the blockage has cleared.

Beverly falls to her knees. Hunching forward. She
vomits forth a stomach full of water... and small
spiders. Mouth agape. Eyes wide in horror. She watches
them scurry into the garden. Beverly tries to scream...

the barriers.(CONTINUED)32.CONTINUED:MIKE(into PDA)

the edge of the abyss. He can't see anything. It's too
dark.

Mike turns away and returns to the yard.    Never
realizing...

Several feet down the shaft. Hidden under a rock... the
shriveled and desiccated corpse of Joshua Taft. It hangs
from the side of the shaft in thick sticky webbing.

there. They stop at what appears to be a normal patch of
ground. Several ostrich feathers are scattered nearby.

Mike takes a closer    look. Something doesn't seem right.
An odd demarcation    in the soil. His fingers trace the
edge of a thin film    of material. It is a lid of sorts.

mine shaft. Bret is shocked as the others follow him.
The group uses the grow lights, and flashlights.BRETYou're going back in there?!       Are
             you all crazy!?WADECome on, Bret!BRETNo way!   I'm not going!

Bret is alone in the room as the upper DOOR IMPLODES and
spiders flood downstairs. Bret dives through the
opening.81.INT. MINE TUNNEL - NIGHTBret runs past Sam and Chris. Sam FIRES her SHOTGUN at
the first spider that enters the tunnel. Her GUN CLICKS
DRY. She un-holsters her PISTOLS and FIRES.CHRISCover me!SAMWhat are you going to do?!

Chris uses the machete to cleave into the tunnel's upper
support beam. More spiders come into the tunnel. Sam
FIRES desperately. Chris keeps on hacking.SAMHurry!

Sam's GUNS CLICK DRY. Spiders charge. Chris swings the
machete hard. The ROOF COLLAPSES onto the attacking
spiders.

Chris and Sam leap back. Landing in a heap. Clouds of
dust swirl around them. They are tangled up for an
awkward beat. Their faces just inches from each other...SAMHold that thought.

They manage to disengage and move on.INT. MINE TUNNEL - NIGHTChris and Sam move toward the bobbing lights of the few
remaining survivors.WADEWe're trapped again!CHRISAt least they can't follow us.SAMWhich way do we go?CHRISI think we're in one of the old
          tunnels.SAMCan you get us out of here?CHRISDon't worry, Sam.

Chris takes point with the others following nervously.82.INT. MINES - JUNCTION - NIGHTA boarded-up shaft entrance. Suddenly the WOOD
SPLINTERS. Chris and the others bash through. They file
into a slightly more open area with two branching
tunnels. The place is stacked from floor to ceiling with
barrels of toxic waste.CHRISI don't believe it...

Mike recognizes the BioHazard warning label he saw on the
barrel in the drainage ditch.MIKEI've seen one of these before!ASHLEYWhat are they?CHRISToxic waste.SAMWhere did you see it, Mike?MIKEThe creek where Joshua gets his
          spider food. There was one in the
          water.

Chris starts toward the sloping tunnel.CHRISWe can get out this way!BRETNo, we can't.
                 (turns to Wade)
          Isn't that tunnel blocked off,
          Dad?

Chris and the others look at Wade.WADEUh... yeah... he's right.   We
          can't get out that way.CHRISYou did this?WADEI knew you'd never sell... We're
          under my property so...(CONTINUED)83.CONTINUED:SAMYou put all of us at risk.WADEI didn't have a choice! I was
             broke! They gave me a hundred

Sam punches him.     Knocking Wade to the ground.SAMI think our lives are worth a
             little more than that.CHRISWe're wasting time.

Chris heads toward the only exit available. The others
follow. Wade staggers to his feet. Stumbling after
them.INT. MINE TUNNEL - NIGHTChris leads the group down a tunnel. They come across
bits of vintage mining gear. A string of old light bulbs
runs along the roof into both tunnels.CHRISOne end of these lights should be
             connected to a generator. That'll
             be near the entrance.

They continue down the tunnel.     Entering...INT. MINES - TARANTULA DEN - NIGHTA large cavern. Animal carcasses litter the ground.
Some human remains. Dead pets. Dead ostriches.WADEMy birds! You see, Sam? I wasn't
             lying! That's what I can put on
             the insurance form... giant
             spiders!ASHLEYEwww... what's that smell?

The others are reacting strongly.(CONTINUED)84.CONTINUED:CHRISMethane.   This cavern is full of
             gas.ASHLEYWhat does that mean?CHRISOne spark and we're all dead.

Norman swallows his glowing joint.

Chris shines his flashlight on a pile of mummy bundles.MIKEThat's what I was talking about,
             Chris. Presents from the male
             tarantula to the female.BRETSo the female's around here?

Bret looks around nervously.

The group moves closer. They sine their lights on a
horrifying sight. Joshua's corpse is a deflated flesh
balloon. Yellowed teeth sneer from a shattered skull.
He's completely desiccated. Every ounce of liquid
drained away.

Mike hides his eyes.     Ashley comforts him.SAMThat one just moved!

Chris runs over and slices it open with his machete.       The
web comes away to reveal a human hand.CHRISThere's somebody in here!

Chris cuts away more web as the other survivors help.
They finally reveal Gladys.CHRISGladys!

The woman's body begins to spasm.CHRISGladys, please...
                    (to the others)
             Can anybody help her?!(CONTINUED)85.CONTINUED:Suddenly Ashley pushes her way forward.ASHLEYHer breathing is shallow.       She's
             going into arrest.

Ashley proceeds with CPR. Just like she saw on TV.
Suddenly Gladys snaps out of it. Gasping for air.CHRISIt's okay.    It's okay.

Gladys starts to get a grip. Trying to focus on Chris.
From this angle Chris look like he has a golden halo.GLADYSAm I... dead?CHRISYou're okay.GLADYSI'm not in heaven?CHRISNo...GLADYSThen what's with all the gold?

Gladys points behind Chris's head to the wall of the
cavern. The group turns their lights on it. The
reflection is dazzling. Veins of gold criss-cross the
cavern walls.WADEGold! Gold!     Look!    It's
             everywhere!SAMIs it real?

Chris checks it out.CHRISJesus... it's the mother lode...
             He was right. My dad was right...

Chris helps Gladys to her feet.         They share an emotional
look of recognition.GLADYSSo were you.(CONTINUED)86.CONTINUED:Wade chips away at the gold.WADEGet as much as you can!

Bret looks at Ashley.BRETNice work, Doc.

Ashley acknowledges him. Bret chips gold with Wade.           Sam
puts her hand on Ashley's shoulder.SAMYou saved my life.

Ashley smiles.

Gladys leans over to Norman.GLADYSHave you got a smoke, kid?NORMANThe man says this cavern is full
             of highly flammable methane gas.
             I smoke to get high, not to die.SAMSpiders!

The group sees a cluster of normal-sized tarantulas
scuttling out of the shadows.NORMANWhat's the big deal?

Norman steps on the closest one, grinding it under his
boot. He stomps around, crushing as many as he can.
Mike watches this curiously. Taking a look at one of the
squashed bodies.MIKEI think you should stop.NORMANWhy?MIKEThey don't have hair. They aren't
          fully grown tarantulas.

Chris and Sam look over.(CONTINUED)87.CONTINUED:MIKEThey're giant babies!

Norman freezes. He hears SOMETHING MOVING around in the
dark. And then a spine chilling... GROWL.

Chris reacts to the noise.    He can guess what's coming...

The FEMALE TARANTULA steps out of the shadows. Consuela
has grown to be as big as a Volkswagen MicroBus. By far
the largest spider we've seen yet. Covered in hair.
Massive eyes. Her two fangs are the size of machetes.

Mike's eyes go wide at the sight of his old nemesis.MIKEConsuela.CHRISConsuela?

The fur on Consuela's back seems to undulate. There is
something weird there. A lot of weird things. In
fact... her entire back is littered with hundreds of baby
tarantulas.

As Consuela advances, she flicks several dart-sized
quills off her belly right into Norman. A dark stain
spreads across the drug dealer's shirt.NORMANBummer...

Consuela pierces Norman with her fangs, holding him
tight. Babies flood of her back and onto the doper,
chewing him to pieces like ravenous piranhas.CHRISGo!

The group flees toward the opposite end of the cavern.        A
male tarantula drops down to block their escape. Sam
BLOWS it away. Wade and Bret are still chipping away
bits of gold.CHRISLeave it!WADESo you can keep it all!?   Hell no!

Wade gets a nugget off the wall. He only has a
nanosecond to admire it before Consuela suddenly looms
behind him.(CONTINUED)88.CONTINUED:BRETDad!

Bret reaches out toward his father. Wade reaches for
him. Consuela's fangs suddenly protrude from Wade's
chest and he's hauled backward. The tarantula flings
Wade into the cave.CHRISBret, come on!

Bret runs after the others. But he sees Consuela firing
more quills at the group. Directly at Ashley. Bret
leaps into harm's way. He's turned into a pin cushion.ASHLEYBret!

Ashley goes to his side.BRETI'm sorry I...

Bret dies.     Sam drags Ashley away from him.INT. MINES - NIGHTThe survivors flee along the tunnel. Chris jumps up to
rip down the string of light bulbs from the ceiling.SAMWe have to get out!CHRISThis is our chance to kill them
             all.

Chris smashes the bulb at the end of the strand.CHRISWhen the power comes on, the bulb
             will ignite the methane and torch
             them!SAMWhere did you get an idea like
             that!?

Chris looks at Gladys.GLADYSI blew up the kitchen.(CONTINUED)89.CONTINUED:CHRISKeep going up the tunnel. There
             should be a generator at the exit.

             Go!SAMWhat about you?CHRISI need to set the fuse as close to
             the spiders as I can. That should
             give us time to get clear.

Sam and Chris share a brief beat. And then Chris pulls
down the lights, dragging them back toward the
tarantula's den.SAMHe has a cute butt.    Don't you
             think?GLADYSU.S.D.A. choice.INT. MINES - TARANTULA DEN - NIGHTChris comes through with his light bulb fuse. Consuela

it to identify a faint draft.CHRISBingo.

He positions the shattered light bulb beside this gas
jet.INT. MINE TUNNELS - NIGHTMike helps Gladys up the tunnel. Sam and Ashley are

over something on the ground. It's Bret Hale's lost
motorcycle. Ashley looks back and sees the tarantula
coming after them.ASHLEYHurry!

Sam lifts the MOTORCYCLE upright and climbs on. She
STARTS it and REVS the ENGINE. Ashley leaps aboard. Sam
accelerates along the shaft, away from the spider. The
bike's headlight illuminates their path.

The male tarantula scurries after the bike.

Sam rides the motorcycle along the shaft. Ashley hangs
on tight. They've put some distance between themselves
and the male tarantula. A dead-end looms before them.
Ashley screams as her mom stops on a dime and does a 180.

Sam rides back the way they came, heading straight toward
the male tarantula. Ashley looks over her mother's
shoulder at the giant spider coming in the opposite
direction.ASHLEYOh shit.(CONTINUED)91.CONTINUED:Sam lifts the bike into a wheelie as the tarantula nears.SAMBanzai!

BLOW UP in the distance.

Chris is just about to climb aboard when... A webline
shoots out of the nearby mine shaft. Consuela lives!
The spider is charred and bloody. But she's primed for
revenge.

Chris is yanked off his feet and hauled toward her.            He
fumbles for his machete and hacks at the webline.
Cutting himself free just before getting impaled on
Consuela's fangs.

Consuela knocks away Chris's machete and lunges down at
him. Chris kicks her belly with both his feet. Consuela
begins to shudder. Jagged cracks appear in her charred
carapace. Chris kicks and tears at the failing armor.
He thinks he's harming the tarantula, but he's actually
helping it!

Mike and the others watch from the humvee.MIKEOh no... she's molting!

Consuela's blistered shell cracks as she shrugs the
damaged skin away from her body. Chris is amazed to see
the spider has grown a full size larger and become
totally rejuvenated!

Consuela comes after Chris.        He defends himself with the
machete.

Shining steel makes contact with the dripping fangs.

the death blow. It looks like curtains for Chris.MIKEConsuela!   No!     Bad!   Bad
