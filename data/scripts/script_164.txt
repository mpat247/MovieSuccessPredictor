mooing almost dreamily in a distant village, he tried to
understand what it all meant -- the sky, and the fields,

                       Vladimir NabokovIn this script there are six main characters who inhabit
different periods of time, from pre-history to the
present day. But there is just one story. Because we
blend into one developing narrative the lives that we
show.

There is no suggestion of time travel or re-incarnation
or any other tricksy or mystic device. We can do in real
time and with real characters what other movies strive to
do with immortal time travellers and ghosts. Our story
is thoroughly based in reality and the magic we are
dealing with is real, human magic.
In moving from one character to the next everything will
change; supporting characters, setting, period. But the
essential situation of our hero of the moment will relate
to the one before and the one following.
The magic will be in the transitions, in leaving one
character and advancing the film through hundreds or
thousands of years to find our next hero in tantalizingly
similar human circumstances. The effect of these transi-
tions across space and time, will let the audience grasp
the simple truth behind our story; that we are all in it
together.
The key to allowing the audience to enjoy this human
connection at the heart of the film is that one actor
will play the six individuals. The feeling will be of
the endless, glorious playing and replaying of the simple
drama of being alive.
We end the film with a present-day hero, but by that time
we will be seeing this modern man in an entirely fresh
light, feeling his kinship with the caveman and the slave
and the others who have gone before. The resolution of
his contemporary story is theirs also. By then perhaps,
we will be able to see ourselves in this novel perspec-
tive, too.

And the structure of the film itself has the thrill of
novelty. It has never before been used in cinema.
Never. Our six characters and their stories connect in
many different ways, some obvious, others vague, tanta-
lizing threads. Even global connections are made, as the
planet itself and all its people, come and go in the
story. For the audience the game of making the connec-
tions, feeling the bonds, even inventing or discovering
associations of their own, will be endless in this big-
gest of stories, smallest of stories. It is truly a new
cinematic experience.                                       **BEING HUMANHector is a family man. He and his woman and two
      children live near the ocean in a sheltered fold on a
      hillside, a shallow cave given protection at its entrance
      by a covering of branches and brush. Just inside a small
      fire smoulders permanently, a few times a day encouraged
      into life for cooking or warmth. If it ever went out it
      would be a catastrophe, so it remains a smouldering com-
      fort and a constant preoccupation for the whole family.
      Hector doesn't know that his name is Hector. It is
      simply a convenience to help us tell his story. The idea
      of individual names is an imaginative leap that has not
      yet been made by mankind when we first meet him. Hector
      is living out his life 4000 years before the birth of
      Christ, in a reasonably temperate zone of the planet. In
      his entire life Hector will traverse no more than ten
      square miles of it.FADE IN:FIRST IMAGEis the reflection of Hector's face in a rock pool. The
      image suddenly fragments. Hector is enjoying himself,
      deflecting his stream of pee now and then so that his
      image reforms itself and then is disrupted again. When
      he is finished, a trace of vanity makes him bend down
      closer to his reflection. He strokes his long hair and
      fingers a blemish on his cheek.
      Then he is aware of another presence. He sharply turns.
      Some way off a solitary figure stands on the rise of some
      rocks, not afraid to show itself. Hector calls out.HECTORGo back home... leave me alone...

      We see that the figure is a young BOY, Hector's son.     The
      Boy thinks about it for a moment, before turning and
      disappearing behind the rocks.1-4   TITLE SCENES                                               1-4The small fire that never goes out has been enlarged to
      cook the day's meal. Beyond the fire on a rock shelf
      HECTOR plays with his children, a GIRL of six and Boy of
      eight. It is the usual rough romp that fathers indulge
      in, but in 4000 BC possibly rougher than normal. Hector
      is acting the part of some trapped wild animal, lashing
      out at the hunters surrounding him. But in his act of
      wild rage he gets carried away. He picks up his son and
      throws him hard, much too hard, on his back.(CONTINUED)2.           *1-4   CONTINUED:                                                   1-4The Boy tumbles down   from the shelf to the cave floor at
      his mother, DEIRDRE's   feet, howling in pain. Deidre
      scowls at Hector. If    the gesture had been invented he
      would probably shrug   his shoulders. The Boy howls on.
      Hector kneels beside his daughter, absorbed in her antics
      as she sleeps. She is a vivid dreamer. Her whole little
      form wriggles and contorts in response to the fantasy
      unspooling in her head. She emits unearthly nighttime
      noises, squeals and giggles and moans. Hector is fasci-
      nated. Where has his daughter gone? Who is this strange
      wild creature that has taken her form, lying beside him?
      Hector's daughter delights him. And while Hector watches
      his daughter, Deirdre from their bed watches Hector.

      It is almost dawn, the cave is quiet and the fire has
      diminished. By its light we see Deirdre and Hector making
      love, on their bed of dried grass and skins. It's diffi-
      cult to say what their lovemaking might look like. What
      has 6000 years done to that art? We will think about it.
      On the far side of the cave we see the sleeping children.
      As we MOVE CLOSER we see that they are far from sleep.
      Two sets of bright eyes peek out from under their cover.
      We CUT BETWEEN them, the loving parents and the watching,
      learning children.
      Hector is arguing with his son, just outside their cave.
      The Boy wants to go foraging with him again.HECTORNo... stay here... stay!
      Hector takes a few steps.    The Boy follows.HECTORNo... go back... go away...

      Hector walks on again, taking big, angry father strides.
      The Boy stubbornly tags along at a safe distance. Hector
      walks on for some time before turning on him.HECTORLeave me alone! Stay here...
                   Stay!

      There is real anger in his voice. The Boy wisely
      retreats to the cave. As Hector turns to continue his
      walk alone he see Deirdre looking at him accusingly from
      the entrance. She holds out her arms ready to comfort
      the Boy rejected by his father. Hector is in the
      classic, timeless, no-win situation and he knows it.
      With a sigh of frustration he heads for the beach.3.         *5   EXT. SHORE - DAY                                             5Hector is foraging on the shoreline, gathering cockles,
    seaweeds, mussels, crabs, anything edible. He splashes
    in the shallows, hoarding the food in a roughly-woven
    bag. Every now and then he will suck a cockle from its
    shell or crunch on a particularly tasty piece of seaweed.
    Hector looks about 30 years old. This is advanced middle
    age for his times and it shows. He has a heavy cold and
    an irritating hack in his throat. In a similar condition
    a modern individual would spend two or three pleasantly
    drugged days in bed, perhaps attempting a little light
    paperwork propped up on some pillows.

    The sun is warming the day. Hector sits on a rock, sur-
    veying his world. He seems very much a part of it. He
    watches some wading seabirds nearby. Like him they are
    nosing around the margins of low tide for food. He
    smiles. In another season they or their eggs will pro-
    vide a meal or two. There is a strange atmosphere of
    appropriateness in the scene, Hector seems such an inte-
    gral part of it. The easy fit of the man in his land-
    scape strikes us. Hector belongs to it in ways that a
    present-day hunter or holiday maker, or even naturalist,
    never could. Also, there is an odd sense of the world
    being rather empty.
    Whether the larger world is round or flat,   spinning or
    orbiting, Hector neither knows nor cares.    He knows
    simple things. Cold and hunger. He knows     warmth, rough
    comfort and companionship. His family and    the safety of
    their cave.
    Further along the shore Hector drops his bag and straigh-
    tens himself, easing the ache in his back. Then some-
    thing disturbs him. From behind a distant headland a
    smudge of smoke trails into the sky. Hector picks up his
    bag and runs. He knows where he is going. He reaches a
    vantage point on some rocks. He steadies himself and
    gazes hard out to sea. We can feel the strain in his
    eyes as he tries to detect any hint of threat in the
    glinting water. Then his jaw drops in fear. Around the
    edge of the headland two dark shapes proceed in regular
    motion. Their steady progress is full of menace. Oar-
    driven boats, slowly, insistently making their way into
    Hector's bay. He jumps from the rocks and runs up the
    beach toward the cave. One thing else that Hector knows
    is fear, blind, gut-turning fear.6   EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY                                          6Hector is a small figure in the landscape now, racing up
    the steep slope in the direction of his home.(CONTINUED)4.       *6   CONTINUED:                                                   6He stops for breath and to look back on the bay. The
    shapes are distinct now, two large open boats, roughly
    made but menacingly adequate for their purpose, coastal
    raiding. The boats are nearing the beach now and figures
    can be seen preparing to land. Hector gathers enough of
    his wits and strength to continue his race up the
    hillside.7   INT. HECTOR'S CAVE - DAY                                     7Inside, his family are in a state of panic. They seem to
    have prepared for this moment. Through their agitation
    there is purpose. They gather bits and pieces to carry
    with them in their flight. Hector's children are attemp-
    ting to take too much. Hector shouts instructions to
    them as he puts more wood on the fire. It must stay
    burning in their absence.
    Hector gathers his family together and they leave the
    cave.8   EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY                                          8Hector shoves his children in one direction up the slope
    further into the hills. His woman runs off the other
    way. A hasty, confused argument takes place.HECTORUp the hill!DEIRDRENo, down onto the other beach.
                 The little ones can't take the
                 hill. Neither can I.HECTORUp the hill! They're down there
                 already. I saw them!DEIRDREYou're wrong!
    She runs off down the slope. Hector has no choice but to
    follow her, herding the children in front of him.

    Deirdre runs on, heading for the lower slope and the cover
    of some trees. Then from these same trees she sees the
    figures of the RAIDERS coming toward her. She turns,
    running back up the hill. Hector and the children also
    turn and run back the way they have come, by now dropping
    precious bits of food and other possessions. The Raiders
    are running strongly, five or six of them.(CONTINUED)5.         *8    CONTINUED:                                                  8The little Girl starts to go back for a precious toy she
     has dropped. Hector picks her up and carries her off
     over his shoulder. The Boy follows.
     Deirdre is trailing behind them. She was right. She
     doesn't have the stamina for the hill. Hector looks back
     and sees the Raiders gaining on her. His face is a con-
     fusion of fear and indecision. He almost stops, as if to
     go back and help her, but then changes his mind and runs
     off once again with the children. Deirdre is by now
     throwing the things she is carrying at her pursuers,
     hoping that they will stop to retrieve them and allow her
     to gain some ground. But they don't stop and the effort
     tires her even more.

     She attempts one final dash and then, all of her energy
     gone, she stops in her tracks and waits for her pursuers.
     the Raiders break their run also and trot and finally
     walk, the distance between them and Deirdre.
     Hector is watching all of this over his shoulder, still
     running. He stops for a moment to watch Deirdre being
     finally surrounded by the Raiders. Then he runs on.9    EXT. VALLEY - DAY                                          9Hector is tiring, too. With the Girl still awkwardly
     clinging to his neck he is picking his way up a steep
     slope, half-dragging the Boy up behind him. He stops
     for a breath and sees the raiders moving into the
     valley below. In a moment of utter panic he lets go of
     his son, drops the Girl from his shoulder, and runs on
     alone. We can sense the moment of release in his
     unburdened flight. But it doesn't last long. Some way
     up the slope he stops and turns. He sees his children,
     only now beginning to work out what has happened, and
     the raiders below. He can't do it. Even as the Girl
     calls to him he is running back down the hill, feeling
     the first stab of a guilt that will never leave him.GIRLCome back, Dada...10   EXT. VALLEY - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY                          10Hector and the children have reached the safety of a
     small valley higher up in the hills. The raiders have
     been slowed down by their capture of Deirdre. Hector
     is hoisting his two children into the lower branches of
     a solitary tree on the hillside. He coaxes them up into
     the higher branches.(CONTINUED)6.10   CONTINUED:                                                 10BOYI'm hungry.HECTORDon't move from here. I'll come
                  for you in the morning. There's
                  no food. Try and sleep in the
                  branches. Don't cry. Don't make
                  a noise.
     Hector moves off, looking back to his children in the
     tree.  They too gaze anxiously at him. They don't wave.
     Maybe waving hasn't been invented yet. Hector heads off
     alone, higher into the hills.11   EXT. ROCKS - DUSK                                          11It is dusk now. We find Hector waking from a fitful
     sleep behind some rocks. He sits up and takes in his
     surroundings. His face hardens as awareness of his pre-
     dicament returns. He stands up and then crouching low,
     moves off down the hill.12   EXT. VALLEY - DUSK                                         12Hector has returned to the area of the tree. He slows
     down some distance away and just in time. He sees a
     figure standing beneath the tree. He moves forward to
     the protection of some rocks, and watches. He is close
     enough to hear the voice of the solitary Raider, although
     he doesn't understand the words. The Raider looks up
     into the branches and talks in a friendly, persuasive
     way.RAIDERIt's too cold to spend all night
                  up there. We've got a fire at the
                  beach. Food, too.

     There is no response from the tree.    The Raider coaxes
     again.RAIDERCome on! Your mother's down
                  there. She's happy... she's warm,
                  too... and full... she wants to
                  see you... she sent me...

     His friendly tone of voice has an effect. There is
     movement in the branches. Hector can see the dark shapes
     of his two children clambering down. The Raider
     stretches out his arms and helps the Boy to the ground.(CONTINUED)7.12   CONTINUED:                                                12Then he reaches up for the Girl, catches her as she drops
     and keeps her in his arms. He laughs in a comforting
     way.RAIDERThat was easy, eh? You're half
                  asleep already, little girl. I'll
                  carry you.
     Hector watches the Raider and his children move slowly
     off, down the hillside, the Raider carrying the Girl in
     one arm and holding the Boy's hand. They almost look
     like a family.13   EXT. BEACH - NIGHT                                        13It is fully dark now. On the beach the Raiders have set
     up a comfortable camp with a large fire. We are still
     with Hector. He has come down from his bleak hiding
     place in the hills. The smell of fire and food and con-
     cern for his family, have drawn him here. He is hiding
     somewhere way off from the camp, but close enough to
     observe it.
     What he sees disturbs him, but for odd reasons. His
     family appear to be happily integrated with the Raiders.
     His two children have become fast friends with the man
     who coaxed them from the tree. His woman is with a
     larger group closer to the fire. They are playfully
     attempting to communicate with her, and although still a
     little timid, she is smiling. There is no hint of bar-         *
     barity, rape or abuse. That was not the intention of the
     Raiders. To them, a fertile woman and two healthy
     children are as gold will be to plunderers of later ages.
     For their part, the family have to accept the situation.
     Food and shelter are the best that life can offer.

     Painfully, Hector takes in the reality of the scene. His
     family have been stolen from him, plain and simple. In
     the morning they will be gone, out to sea and round the
     headland forever. He watches them for a while longer,
     then it becomes too painful. He retreats into the dark-
     ness and up into the empty hills again.14   EXT. ROCK SHELTER - NIGHT                                 14Hector spends a long, cold night alone, squatting in a
     narrow crevice in the rocks. He doesn't sleep, or even
     attempt to close his eyes. He stares into the darkness.
     There is nothing in the world to comfort him, no phi-
     losophy or religion, no friend to run to. This night he
     is utterly alone.8.15   EXT. ROCKS - MORNING                                       15In the morning it is lightly raining. Hector stands in
     the drizzle outside the shelter. It seems to revive him,
     refresh him, even comfort him. A sign, however meager,
     that life goes on. Then Hector trots off in the direc-
     tion of the shore. There is not much else that he can
     do.16   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                           16The Raiders are loading up their boats, wading back and
     forth from the shoreline. Hector watches from cover.
     His family are already on one of the boats, awaiting            *
     whatever lies ahead, too afraid to betray real emotion.         *

     The last of the Raiders on shore wade out the short dis-
     tance to the boats. Hector watches these moments of
     departure, watches the faces of his family.
     Hector makes his move. In a mad act he breaks cover and         *
     runs down toward the departing boats. The last Raiders
     are climbing aboard. Hector charges at full speed to the
     water's edge. He screams agonizingly at the Raiders and
     impotently starts throwing stones at them. The Raiders
     all look at him. The LEADER is impudently brushing
     Hector's missiles aside, like so many flies and smiling.
     Suddenly Hector's rage and energy leave him. He stands
     looking at the Raiders and they look at him, for a long
     moment. The Raiders are all young men, hardly into their
     twenties, and nowadays might resemble something like a          *
     motorcycle gang. But in Hector's time they are men in
     the full prime of life. They begin to laugh and exchange
     remarks about Hector. He returns their looks fiercely.
     His woman and children sit on the boat, frozen in fear.         *
     The Leader eventually turns from Hector, still smiling
     and gives an order. The men lift their oars and prepare
     to leave. Then an older man stands up in the other boat.
     He calls over to the Leader, nodding in the direction of
     Hector. Hector doesn't know what they are saying, but
     they have an intense exchange, obviously centered on him.
     The older man seems to be an adviser, a priest or wise
     man, although he's still only about thirty years old.
     The Leader listens to him intently. The PRIEST talks and
     points to the cliffs. The Leader looks there and nods
     his head. He gives some instructions to his men. Hector
     stands, bemused. Six or so of the Raiders leave the
     boats, wade ashore and without any resistance from him,
     take hold of Hector. Hector's children instictively rise        *
     as if to defend their father, but Deirdre, despite her          *
     own feelings, wisely holds them back.                           *9.17   EXT. CLIFFS - DAY                                             17Hector's hands have been bound with rope. He is being
     led up to the top of the cliffs. The Priest and the
     Leader walk on ahead, still talking intensely.
     At the top of the cliff the bay and the boats and the
     wide sea are stretched out beneath them. The Priest, as
     they arrive, becomes excited. He points to a pile of
     large stones at the very summit of the headland. The
     mound of stones is obviously man-made.PRIESTI told you! I knew they did it
               around here! Ask him...
     The Leader moves closer to Hector and talks to him in a
     friendly, reasoning tone.LEADERWhat do we do? Do we throw you
               over, is that the idea?
     Hector doesn't understand.    He looks at him blankly.LEADERHe wants me to throw you over.
               What does it do? Does it help the
               sun? Should I throw you over?
     The Leader tries to help Hector understand by miming the
     act of throwing him off the cliff. Hector doesn't know
     how to respond.PRIESTI tell you, it's one man, one
               stone. It'll help the voyage.
     The Leader is unsure. He walks around the pile of
     stones, checking it out from all sides as if it was some
     infernal machine that he didn't know the workings of. He
     squats down and squints through it to the watery sun
     emerging from the clouds far out to sea. He looks across
     to Hector, now sitting on the grass. The Leader sits
     down beside him. They sit together like friends. The
     ageless intimacy of sacrificer and victim.LEADERWhat's it got to do with the sun?PRIESTI don't know, yet.

     The Leader looks at Hector.    Then he makes up his mind.(CONTINUED)10.17   CONTINUED:                                                     17LEADERNo.  It's too much of a risk.
                  Just add a stone to the pile. Let
                  him go. That's the best we can
                  do.  Let's go.

     With that, he stands up. The Priest, with some       sense of
     ceremony, looks around for a large stone, picks      one up
     and places it on top of the pile. He waits for       a moment,
     almost as if he expects some consequence of his      action.PRIESTIt's meaningless, without him
                  going over the cliff.

     The Leader strides off back toward the beach. The others
     follow him, giving a final look or smile to Hector, apart
     from the Priest, who looks him up and down, regretting
     that he is not by now a corpse in the ocean. Hector
     watches them go, too shocked still to react in any mean-
     ingful way. He stands alone, trying to unpick the rope
     that binds his hands.
     When they are some distance from him, Hector starts to
     follow them, at first running to catch up and then simply
     trotting after them. The Raiders are aware of him behind
     them. The Leader eventually stops and calls to Hector.LEADEROff you go.   We don't want you.
     He turns from Hector   and moves on. Hector persists in
     following them. They    are his only connection now with
     anything that thinks   or feels in the world. His link
     with them is all that   is left. Again and again the
     Leader stops to shoo   Hector away, but Hector dumbly tags
     along behind.18   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                               18The Raiders wade out to the waiting boats. Hector
     follows to the very water's edge, then stands and bleakly
     watches them. The Raiders prepare to move off. Hector
     is an embarrassment to them now. At the last moment the
     Leader gives a brusque order to one of his men. The man
     clambers out of the boat and wades ashore again,
     carrying a large flint-bladed knife. He comes out of the
     water and walks up to Hector. Hector is beyond any form
     of reaction. He will take whatever is offered to him.
     The man comes close, the knife held ready. He stands in
     front of Hector for a moment. On the boat, Hector's
     family are tense with fear for his life.(CONTINUED)11.18   CONTINUED:                                                 18Then the tense moment passes, as the man grunts and nods
     at Hector's hands, still bound with rope. Hector under-
     stands. He lifts his hands and the man with some effort
     hacks through the rough hemp. Then he turns and wades
     back to the boat.

     As the man clambers aboard the Leader speaks to him. The
     man stops, drops back into the water, and returns to
     Hector on the shore. He offers Hector the cut piece of
     rope, a weird gesture of conciliation. He even smiles.
     Hector refuses the gift. The man stands sheepishly for a
     moment, then drops the rope at Hector's feet and wades
     back to the boat. A piece of rope in exchange for a
     family.

     Hector watches them for some time, his family and the
     strange Raiders, as they, achingly slowly, retreat from
     his view and his life.
     At last he turns and moves up from the shoreline. He
     goes some distance then stops, thinks for a moment, then
     retraces his steps. He goes back to the water's edge,
     picks up the piece of rope that bound him, and walks
     off with it. It might be of some use to him.19   INT. CAVE - DAY                                            19Hector has returned to his cave home, now cold and empty
     of life. He is working on his instincts now, still
     emotionally in shock. He digs around in the embers of
     the fire. Some of the larger bits of wood still hold
     some life. Hector bends low and starts to waft expertly         *
     and blow at the fire's remains.
     We leave our first Hector squatting at his fire, in the
     simplest act of physical survival. For him the problems
     of emotional survival without his family lie ahead.20   INT. BATHHOUSE FURNACE - DAY                               20This is another, bigger fire. In fact we might be in
     hell. A crude furnace blazes. Filthy, sweat-covered
     men feed it with wood and charcoal, an endless task given
     the ferocity of the fire. To one side of the oppressive,
     low-ceilinged furnace room, some small boys endlessly
     toil at two large bellows, feeding the flames with jets
     of air. OVER the NOISE of the FURNACE someone is
     WHISTLING, an odd human sound in an inhuman setting.
     Shadowy figures come and go with barrow loads of wood.
     We TILT UP TO the space above the furnace to see a mass
     of dangerously crude clay pipes, oozing water and steam
     at every joint.12.21   INT. BATHHOUSE - DAY                                      21Above the heat and filth there is a different world. A
     clean, beautifully tiled world of lazing figures, droning
     conversations and resonant laughter. It is the hot room
     of a bathhouse somewhere in the Roman Empire. We have
     advanced 4000 years into the future and it shows in the
     technology. It is men's day at the bathhouse. All of
     the people relaxing in the water look prosperous and
     comfortable with themselves. Slaves wait in attendance,
     some around the edge of the pool, others in the water
     rubbing backs and massaging shoulders. There are three
     or four times as many slaves as bathers, and the proprie-
     torial way that they look after their masters gives the
     place the odd atmosphere of a kindergarten for over-
     indulged grown-ups.

     And then we find our Hector. He stands against the wall,
     holding a large towel. Although clean-shaven and more
     healthy-looking we can still recognize Hector, more so         *
     by the look in his eyes. There is a set to his face
     that tells us he is a man alone, emotionally detached
     from his surroundings. He is a personal body slave. He
     watches his master in the pool, alert to any hint of need
     that he might have.

     Hector's master LUCINNIUS is not as relaxed as the others
     around him. He is in anxious conversation with an older        *
     man wading beside him. We don't hear what they are saying
     but there is enough body language to detect Lucinnius'
     pleading and the older man's cool distraction. The older
     man gives a final dismissive shake of his head. Hector         *
     immediately moves to the side of the pool with the towel as
     Lucinnius climbs out of the water.LUCINNIUSI'm going to the cool room.22   INT. BATHHOUSE - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY                      22   *Hector wraps the towel around his master and follows him,
     a look of concern on his face. Lucinnius' worries are
     Hector's also.
     Hector walks a pace behind Lucinnius through various
     chambers of the bathhouse, passing the games area and
     the massage room as they go. All around them slaves
     attend to their pampered masters.23   INT. BATHHOUSE - COOL ROOM - DAY                          23   *After an anxious scan of the cool room, Lucinnius goes
     towards three men occupying a marble bench.(CONTINUED)13.23   CONTINUED:                                                   23Hector as if by magic produces a small wooden stool for
     his master to sit on as he joins the others. Hector then
     moves out of earshot, but still alert to his master's
     behavior. Lucinnius is nervous as he attempts to
     casually join his friends. The eldest of the three
     gives off as much of the aura of a Godfather as a naked
     man in a towel can. The other two are deferential to
     the older man, and treat Lucinnius with apparent con-
     tempt. Hector watches the older man put a paternal
     hand on Luccinius's shoulder and speak with a calm
     smile on his face. Hector almost winces to see his
     master submit to this patronizing treatment. Slave
     and master exist so closely together that many of
     their feelings are shared. More precisely, Lucinnius's
     feelings are shared by Hector. It is a one-way exchange.
     From morning until night, and probably in his dreams too,
     Hector is living two lives, his own and his master's.
     Here in ancient Rome is this what they call classic
     schizophrenia?
     As Luccinius stands to leave we can    tell by their expres-
     sions that the THREE MEN are open in    their contempt for
     him. Hector is quickly on his feet     and by Lucinnius's
     side as he goes. A final sarcastic     remark comes from one
     of the three.MAN #1Well washed, Lucinnius.

     Lucinnius tries to muster his dignity as they leave.              *24   EXT. STREET - DAY                                            24This is not the grandeur of Rome, but the dusty main
     street of a provincial capital in Greece or Spain or
     North Africa. It is difficult to tell from the people
     because they are such a cosmopolitan crowd, faces from
     every corner of the Mediterranean world. It has some-
     thing of the atmosphere of a frontier town in a western,
     except that here the half-finished buildings are made of
     brick and stone.
     Lucinnius leaves the bathhouse. Hector follows three
     paces behind him, loaded down with the large towel, the
     scrubber, robe, and the wooden stool. The stool goes
     with them everywhere, in case Lucinnius has to stop in
     the street and converse with a friend. Other notables
     are among the street throng, their own slaves tagging
     along behind with their little wooden stools. Some have
     whole trains of slaves shadowing them. Human status
     symbols. Lucinnius stops near some street stalls.
     Hector stops beside him.(CONTINUED)14.        *24   CONTINUED:                                                  24LUCINNIUSBad omens, Hector. Bad omens.
                  Get me something to eat. Just
                  a mouse or two.HECTORYes.

     Hector places the stool at Lucinnius's feet and moves off.
     Lucinnius sits down, still absorbed in his problems.

     Hector keeps an eye on Lucinnius as he orders the food.HECTORTwo mice... and some bread...STALLHOLDERNo mice.HECTORTwo chicken legs, then, cold, and
                  the bread.
     As Hector is given the food and pays for it, he sees
     another man, JULIAN, approach Lucinnius, trailed by TWO
     SLAVES. One of them is carrying a folding chair much
     more substantial than Lucinnius's. Julian and Lucinnius
     greet one another and sit down to talk, Lucinnius at
     something of a height disadvantage. The Two Slaves move
     off to one side. Lucinnius's mood has brightened since
     the arrival of his friend. Their conversation seems open
     and friendly.
     Hector gives his master his food, and then moves to join
     the Two Slaves, hearing a snatch of the conversation as
     he goes.JULIANOf course you're free to call at my
                  house at anytime, but I was
                  receiving Nepos... how could I
                  admit you?
     Hector offers to share his bread with the other Two
     Slaves. They easily fall into conversation, inevitably,
     about their masters.SLAVE #1Spoiled his day, meeting your man...
                  he's been avoiding him all week.SLAVE #2His ships have gone too, we heard.(CONTINUED)15.24   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              24This is news to Hector.HECTORWhen did you hear?SLAVE #2Last night. Nepos knew. Pirates.
                  They're sunk, he reckons. That
                  could finish him, eh?HECTORThis is the worst it's been.                           *SLAVE #1You'll be up for sale before you
                  know it!

     This makes them laugh, Hector less so than the other
     two.HECTORHe's finished... you reckon?
     The other two nod their heads.SLAVE #1Yes... at the baths... I could
                  tell... they smelled blood...HECTORWell... if he'd pulled it off he'd
                  be in Rome by now...SLAVE #1And you with him...
     Hector nods his head thoughtfully.HECTORAnd me with him... half way home...

     Lucinnius and his friend stand and exchange their final
     words, unaware of the scrutiny they have been under, or
     so used to it that they are oblivious to it. Hector
     and the Slaves hurry to gather up the seats and take their          *
     positions behind their masters. The casualness of their
     conversation has gone, and they resume the formality of
     their roles.25   EXT. STREET - DAY                                              25Lucinnius is eager to talk, and tosses his words over his
     shoulder to Hector.(CONTINUED)16.25   CONTINUED:                                                     25LUCINNIUSHe's a true friend, probably the
                  only one I have left.
     Hector obligingly trots a step or two closer to Lucinnius
     to aid their conversation.HECTORWill he lend you the money?LUCINNIUSHe was honest about it. He said
                  so, plain and simple. No.HECTORThat's a problem.

     Lucinnius unburdens himself.LUCINNIUSAnd the ships have gone... did I
                  tell you that?HECTORHave they?LUCINNIUSCyprian knows already. He'll
                  want his money back too...
     We can see the concentration on Hector's face as he
     concocts appropriate responses.
     He has a tough occupation, being the alter ego to an
     ambitious loser in one of the most competitive and
     dangerous societies ever to exist. And he has to carry
     the stool and the towel as well.LUCINNIUSWhen we get home I want you to get
                  some chickens... and fetch Hermas,
                  the diviner.HECTORYes.26   INT. HOUSE - DAY                                               26At home, we find Lucinnius and Hector with the diviner
     HERMAS. They are gathered around a shrine in the large
     public room. The entrails of a chicken lie on a slab of
     marble. Hermas prods them with a knife. He makes much
     of the mysteries of his craft, as if it were a skill
     beyond ordinary men.(CONTINUED)17.26   CONTINUED:                                                 26The other two peer over his shoulders. Suitably mysti-
     fied, Lucinnius talks in a reverent low voice.LUCINNIUSAre my ships from Sicily still
                  afloat...?

     Hermas tetchily stops him.HERMASNo, no... offer the grain first...
                  sprinkle it on the altar...
     Lucinnius obeys.HERMAS... and we can't ask the Gods
                  specific questions like that...
                  it's a gentle, probing enquiry...
                  general questions... but let's
                  see.
     He cuts into the chicken liver and prods around the in-
     side. The other two wait in silence.HERMASGeneral answer... no...*LUCINNIUSWhat do you mean?HERMASI mean, no.   The liver says no...

     Lucinnius objects.LUCINNIUSDo it again... I want you to do it

                  the first fifteen now  please.
     Hector looks a Lucinnius, who nods reluctantly. Hector
     opens his purse and counts out the coins for Hermas.18.27   INT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                           27Hector is giving Lucinnius a soothing shoulder massage.

     Lucinnius is still in a talking mood.   His troubles
     won't allow him to relax.LUCINNIUSCyprian loaned me half a million
               to fit out these ships... I'm                           *
               finished. Just when things were
               going well... I had plans for you
               too, Hector... in four or five
               years I was going to make you a

               could've found your family...
               brought them here... everything...

     Hector smiles ruefully.HECTORIt sounds good.
     Lucinnius misses the irony in Hector's voice and enthuses
     about his own future generosity.LUCINNIUSIt does, doesn't it!
     Lucinnius is silent for a while as Hector continues to            *
     rub his shoulders.LUCINNIUSI shouldn't give up. I can't...
               I'll visit Cyprian, first thing
               tomorrow... before the others can
               get to him... he's got to see
               reason... I can pay him back...
               sometime. It's the only chance
               we have, Hector. Should I do it?HECTORYou must.LUCINNIUSYou're right.    I must.

     This burst of resolve has relaxed Lucinnius.   His tense
     muscles yield more to Hector's fingers.
     THALIA enters the room. She is a household slave, a
     Nubian from Africa. She carries a lighted torch and
     moves around the room lighting the wall lamps. Lucinnius
     watches her.(CONTINUED)19.27   CONTINUED:                                                   27LUCINNIUSThalia, I think I need one of

                  finish the lamps.
     Hector does as he is told. He takes the torch from
     Thalia and discreetly leaves the room, hearing Lucinnius
     as he closes the door.LUCINNIUSLower, Thalia.28   INT. HECTOR'S ROOM - NIGHT                                   28Late at night, Hector is still awake. He rises from his
     bed and quietly moves out of the room. He is careful
     not to disturb the sleeping forms lying all around him,
     some of them sprawled on the floor. He shares his bed-
     room with at least eight other slaves. Privacy is a
     master's privilege.29   INT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                           29In the darkened house, Hector makes his way up some
     stairs and along a passage. The only sound is a crack
     or two of far-away THUNDER. At the end of the passage,
     Hector finds a small ladder propped against the wall.
     He climbs this, and lifts open the trap door above his
     head.30   EXT. ROOF - NIGHT                                            30Odd flashes of lightning far out to sea are the only
     source of light as Hector moves across the flat roof.
     In one corner he sees what he is looking for, the outline
     of a figure resting against the low parapet wall. He
     moves towards it. The figure speaks.FIGUREI missed you last night.
     It is Thalia. We can tell that they are close.      Hector
     sits down beside her.HECTORHe kept me working until morning.THALIAWhat's happening?(CONTINUED)20.30   CONTINUED:                                                     30HECTORHe has no money and a lot of
                  enemies. If he's very clever he'll
                  survive... but the omens are bad...
                  and he's not very clever.THALIAShe doesn't like him.HECTORNobody does. He's unfortunate.
                  You get people like that. Clumsy
                  and sad.
     Thalia looks out towards the sea.THALIAWhy does the thunder always stay
                  out on the ocean?
     Hector puts an arm around Thalia. At first it feels                 *
     strange, their physical intimacy alongside their matter-
     of-fact conversation, but gradually we understand it, the
     giving and taking of comfort where it can be found, and
     the realness of their friendship. Their stroking and
     touching and holding becomes good to watch. We get a
     feeling for what they have given one another, in stolen
     hours and half hours, up here on the roof, the only place
     where they can be themselves.HECTORIt's the Gods arguing. They're
                  working out what to do with
                  Lucinnius... he'll be lying awake
                  down there... wondering what
                  they're saying about him.

     They laugh.    Far away some street DOGS BARK.HECTORIf he goes down I'll ask for my
                  freedom... he owes it to me... he
                  said as much... you too... we
                  could be free...THALIAThen what?HECTORWhat we talk about.

     By now he is kissing her.(CONTINUED)21.30   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                30THALIAWe talk about going home. Yours

                  That's all.THALIAWell.   We stay here.   He'll survive.                   *
     Hector is silent, still kissing her.      He yawns as he              *
     speaks.HECTORThen I can see you every night.
                  I'm tired.31   INT. HECTOR'S ROOM - NIGHT                                       31Hector is back in his bed. A figure enters the room,
     steps over the sleeping bodies on the floor and shakes
     him awake. Hector comes to. Lucinnius stands over him,
     whispering.LUCINNIUSI can't sleep. Get me a chicken.
                  I want to make another sacrifice.
                  We'll do it ourselves.

     Hector wearily takes himself out of bed and follows
     Lucinnius out of the room.22.        *32   INT. HENHOUSE - NIGHT                                       32Hector is in the henhouse, in the dark, selecting a
     chicken for sacrifice. He is about to leave when he
     sees a MAN and WOMAN, arms around each other, sitting in
     a corner. The Man looks at the white hen Hector is
     holding.MANCan't you find a woman, Hector...
     Hector smiles. He isn't surprised to see them. They are
     only doing what he and Thalia do on the roof. The Slaves
     have their meeting places scattered all over the house.HECTORSorry to trouble you... just
               fetching a chicken... good night
               ... the roof's free...
     The Man shakes his head with a smile. Hector leaves, the
     sleepy chicken going to meet her fate in his arms.HECTORCome on, miss, you can tell
               Lucinnius his future.33   EXT. STREET - MORNING                                       33Hector and Lucinnius are approaching the home of Cyprian.
     Hector as usual is walking some paces behind his master,
     and he carries a large satchel of documents. Cyprian's
     home is a street palace. It is early in the morning, but
     there is already activity around the house, visitors
     coming and going, messengers, petitioners. A few impor-
     tant callers arrive in litters, carried by slaves.
     Lucinnius and Hector even have to join a line at the door
     and are checked in by the gateman. Lucinnius's hopes of
     quietly bending Cyprian's ear are dashed. It seems as
     if the whole world owes allegiance to this provincial
     Mr. Big.34   EXT. COURTYARD - MORNING                                    34The slaves gather on one side of the courtyard, gossiping
     and playing games of chance on the ground. Their masters
     wait on the other side of the courtyard, seated on
     benches along the wall. Cyprian's aides usher the
     visitors into his presence in a regular flow, some have
     an audience of a few minutes, others last merely seconds.

     Hector keeps an eye on Lucinnius, like a mother watching
     her child from a distance on its first day at school.(CONTINUED)23.34   CONTINUED:                                                     34Lucinnius, sitting expectantly in line, does look a
     little pathetic, even ridiculous. Straight-backed, hands
     on knees, alert, worried, he looks a bit like a sacri-
     ficial offering himself.
     Hector plays a game of five-stone with some other slaves
     as he watches Lucinnius shuffling up the bench place by
     place to the front of the line. We almost expect Hector
     to give him a little wave of encouragement as he is
     finally summoned into the inner office. Hector waits.
     The first signs seem good. Lucinnius doesn't emerge
     within the first minute. Cyprian is at least giving him
     the time of day. More minutes pass. Hector watches a
     game of handball while keeping an eye on the office door.
     One or two others, familiar to us from the bathhouse, go
     into the office. So does Lucinnius' friend Julian.

     Eventually Lucinnius emerges into the sunlight, a broad
     smile on his face. Hector relaxes and leaves the ball
     game to join him.HECTORYou look happier.LUCINNIUSRelieved anyway... relieved that
                  it's over at last.
     Lucinnius strides out of the courtyard with Hector
     following after him.35   EXT. STREETS - DAY                                             35Lucinnius and Hector are walking home in their usual
     formation. Hector is closer than normal, so that they
     can talk.HECTORWill he help you?LUCINNIUSI have to kill myself by tomorrow
                  morning. He has all my letters to
                  Titinius, none of them got
                  through. He says it's like
                  treason... and he says I should
                  want to die for owing him half a
                  million anyway...

     Hector is shocked.HECTORWhat if you don't...(CONTINUED)24.35   CONTINUED:                                                     35LUCINNIUSThen he will... and that wouldn't
                  be pleasant... he would drag me to
                  Rome... those letters...
     Lucinnius shivers to think of them.LUCINNIUSI'm done for, Hector... but it's
                  strange... I feel kind of good
                  about it... the struggle is over
                  ... we've seen it through
                  together, eh?HECTORI don't know what to say.LUCINNIUSLet's get home. We have a lot to
                  do.
     Lucinnius quickens his pace.LUCINNIUSTonight... peace at last...
     Lucinnius is obviously in a state of shock.36   INT. HOUSE - DAY                                               36Hector and Lucinnius are in his study. Lucinnius is
     busy clearing up his papers. He is less hysterical than
     in the previous scene, more aware of the reality of what
     he has to do.LUCINNIUSWe'll do it with a knife, Hector.
                  When everyone has gone to bed.
                  The two of us, to the end...HECTORI don't understand. What do you
                  want me to do... I don't think I
                  can help you...LUCINNIUSWe'll help each other, Hector. We
                  must. We've been through this
                  whole mess together... we must die
                  together.(CONTINUED)25.36   CONTINUED:                                                   36HECTORI don't know what you mean.   What
                  mess?                                                *LUCINNIUSYou don't understand do you? I'm
                  asking you to die with me...
                  you're my closest, my dearest
                  slave... what would they say about
                  me if you refused to die with me?
                  This is honor... we're choosing                      *
                  death... we're not going to submit
                  to the humiliations that Cyprian
                  can heap on us, are we?HECTORYou say we... I don't know... what
                  is we? I've done nothing... I                        *
                  know nothing...
     Lucinnius changes his tone, becomes more, in his own
     mind, frank, man-to-man.LUCINNIUSHector... at Cyprian's this morning
                  ... I had to sign certain papers
                  ... tell a bit of a story...*HECTORWhat kind of story?LUCINNIUSA confession. That we were
                  plotting against Cyprian and the
                  provincial senate... we were short
                  of names... most of the people I
                  know were in the room... people I
                  thought were my friends... so I
                  mentioned you... I had to...
     Hector is stunned with shock...HECTORSo I'm a conspirator?LUCINNIUSYes. So you see, I don't want you
                  to die with me just because of my
                  honor... it's more complicated...
                  I'm sorry, Hector. I would be
                  honored... if you would die with
                  me... I mean it...
     Hector manages to speak.(CONTINUED)26.        *36   CONTINUED:     (2)                                             36HECTORCan I sit down?LUCINNIUSOf course.HECTORThis is the worst it's been.37   EXT. COURTYARD - DAY                                           37Hector is in   the inner courtyard of the house, beside the
     kitchen. He    is talking to GALLUS, who is Lucinnius's
     ten-year-old   son. Hector has a close friendship with
     him. As we    listen to their conversation it becomes clear
     that Hector   finds comfort in the boy, for the family that
     he lost.
     Today there is an air of distraction about Hector.
     Understandable, considering his scheduled death.
     The kitchen slaves come and go as they talk.HECTORBut even if it's round you can
                  still fall off the edge.
     Hector has picked up a large metal plate to help him make
     his point.GALLUSNo... it's not round like that...
                  it's round like this.
     Gallus sees his playball.     He picks it up.HECTORDo you believe everything that
                  Greek tells you...?

     Gallus ignores this tease, intent on the ball.GALLUSRome must be right in the middle...
                  here... and we must be out here
                  somewhere...
     Hector becomes more interested.(CONTINUED)27.37   CONTINUED:                                                37HECTORSo, where is my home?GALLUSHow many months did they march you
                  here?HECTORSeven.
     Gallus walks out the distance from Rome with his fingers,      *
     as if there is serious calculation.                            *GALLUSIt must be about here.                            *

     His fingers stop on the other side of the ball.GALLUSBut then you'd be upside down...HECTORI wasn't upside down... and how                   *
                  could you see the sun round there
                  ... I saw the sun at home... every
                  day...
     Gallus is stumped for answers.                                 *GALLUSI'll ask him tomorrow...                          *
     Hector remembers that he and the boy's father are              *
     supposed to die that night. He looks on Gallus with a          *
     new tenderness.HECTORYes, tell me tomorrow... I'd like

     chicken stands on the altar.(CONTINUED)28.38   CONTINUED:                                                   38Hector and Lucinnius watch it as if their lives depended
     on it. Perhaps they do.LUCINNIUSIf he eats the grain it means yes.

     He scatters some grain on the table.     The chicken at once
     begins to peck them up.HECTORIt's saying yes... there's a way...LUCINNIUSNo, it's saying yes, we should die.HECTORBut you asked it if we had to die,
                  or if there was another way... it's

     The bird is certainly enjoying his food.HECTORMaybe it's just hungry...
     The chicken is inscrutable, as they are prone to be.39   INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT                                     39A dead chicken adorns Lucinnius's table. He and his
     wife, DALMIA, and their son are lying on their couches
     picking at the food with their fingers. Lucinnius is
     drinking more wine than usual. Hector and the other
     household slaves are in attendance. Thalia is also
     there, serving her mistress.
     Dalmia knows something is up, but she doesn't know what.
     She attempts to break the silence. She calls on the cook
     from the kitchen.DALMIASolus!

     The kitchen slave quickly appears.DALMIASolus... I'm eating chicken again.
                  I ate chicken yesterday and the
                  day before... will I be eating
                  chicken again tomorrow? Why am I

     him no help.SOLUSIt's what we have to hand in the

                  chickens have just been turning
                  up...
     He looks again at Lucinnius and Hector. They look at
     each other. Thalia looks at Hector. Dalmia looks at
     them all looking at each other, more intrigued than she
     was before.

     A SLAVE interrupts them.SLAVETwo men have come to see you.
                  From Cyprian.
     Lucinnius and Hector look at each other and share a
     moment of hope. They might be coming with good news,
     perhaps a softening of Cyprian's heart.40   INT. RECEPTION ROOM - NIGHT                                 40The two VISITORS that await Lucinnius and Hector are an
     unpromising sight. They are big men, unsophisticated and
     look uncomfortable in their well-cut togas. A couple of
     the godfather's foot soldiers.
     They greet Lucinnius deferentially, but he knows that
     they would break his back at the whim of their master.VISITORGood evening, Lucinnius. Cyprian
                  asked us if we could be of any                      *

                  care of my affairs tonight without

     Hector is closing the door when one of the Visitors talks
     roughly to him.VISITORYou.    Come here.
     Hector instinctively looks to his master. Lucinnius
     doesn't protest, but retreats into the house. Hector is
     left alone with the Visitors.VISITORHe looks like the kind that'll
                  want some help. Have you ever
                  killed before?HECTOROnly chickens.VISITORHe's not much different. Use a
                  thin blade, but long. Get it in
                  deep... the heart... feel for a
                  space between the ribs...

     He prods at Hector's body freely, showing him what to do.
     If it is ticklish, Hector doesn't let on.VISITOR... or go in from the back... any
                  place he'll let you...
     We leave Hector nodding obediently as this weirdest of
     coaching lessons continues.VISITORGetting it out's not as easy as
                  you might think... you have to
                  twist a bit... to get over the
                  stickiness...31.41   INT. STUDY - NIGHT                                            41Late at night in Lucinnius's study, an oil     lamp and a
     candle cast their shadowy light, adding to     the tension in
     the room. Hector stands beside Lucinnius,      who is
     counting out coins and other valuables on     his table.LUCINNIUSEight hundred sesterces... cash
               ... that's all that's left... what
               a failure... my father left me
               three farms and forty thousand...

     Lucinnius places the money in a box on his table. He is
     quite drunk, resigned now to his fate. Hector however is
     cold sober, grim-faced. Lucinnius looks up at him.LUCINNIUSNothing else to be done.    Don't
               you want some wine?HECTORNo... but I want something...LUCINNIUSWhat is it?HECTORI want to die a free man... I
               don't want to die a slave...

     Lucinnius looks at him grimly and manages a smile. He              *
     clears his throat and attempts to put a note of ceremony
     into his voice.LUCINNIUSHector,    by this proclamation, I
               make you    a freed man... I don't
               know the    exact words... I've never
               done it    before... But you're free,
               Hector.*HECTORIn writing... so that when they
               find me... they know I died a free
               man... please...

     Lucinnius looks at him for a moment, then reaches out for
     his paper and pen.LUCINNIUSVery well...

     He scratches out a few words on the paper, Hector looking
     over his shoulder, keenly watching what he writes.
     Lucinnius finishes writing and lays down the pen.(CONTINUED)32.41   CONTINUED:                                                      41LUCINNIUSThey'll find it in the morning.
                  It's a nice thought, Hector... you
                  were right to ask.HECTORThank you.LUCINNIUSWell... freed man, let's do it.                         *

     Lucinnius picks up a large kitchen knife which lies on
     the table. He fingers its blade.*A trickle of fear passes across Hector's face.       Will the
     half-drunk Lucinnius want to kill him first?HECTORWhat do you want me to do?LUCINNIUSNothing... I mean, not to me... I
                  have to do it first... you
                  understand that... and then you...
                  if I don't succeed... then you
                  must help me...HECTORI understand.LUCINNIUSNo point in messing up the room.
                  Let's go downstairs.

     Lucinnius stands and leaves the room.     Hector follows
     with the oil lamp.42   INT. PASSAGE - NIGHT                                            42The house is quiet and in darkness as they walk along the
     passage and down the stairs to the washing room. Hector
     walks behind, casting the light on Lucinnius's crumpled,
     defeated form. Lucinnius begins to sob, at first
     quietly, then more loudly and more pathetically. Hector
     looks around and behind him, afraid, or perhaps hoping,
     that Lucinnius's moans will wake the household.43   INT. WASH ROOM - NIGHT                                          43Lucinnius has worked himself into a dramatic state of
     distress, with drink and terror and self pity.(CONTINUED)33.        *43   CONTINUED:                                                     43He runs into the tiled washing room, wails loudly and
     makes a stabbing motion at his stomach. Hector sees all
     of this from behind as he enters the room. Lucinnius
     crumples to the floor and squats on his knees. He calls
     out in pain.LUCINNIUSOh, that hurts, that stings!
     Lucinnius sits back on the step of the washing pool,
     holding his stomach. Hector sits down beside him. They
     both look down at the blade, still in Lucinnius' body.LUCINNIUSThis is hopeless.

     They sit absurdly like this for a long moment, neither
     of them knowing what do do next. It's awkward, like in a
     waiting room. Then Lucinnius speaks.LUCINNIUSHelp me, Hector...HECTORYou've done it... you've done it
                  ... lie down...
     Hector speaks gently, like coaxing a frightened animal.
     He helps Lucinnius lie out on the marble floor.HECTORClose your eyes... you did it...LUCINNIUSThank you, thank you.
     The movement has increased the spread of blood over
     Lucinnius' clothing. He raises his head.LUCINNIUSYou do it now, Hector... hurry...HECTORLie still... lie still...LUCINNIUSDo it Hector... do it... you
                  promised...
     It looks as if Hector is playing for time.HECTORShush... I'll need the knife...(CONTINUED)34.43   CONTINUED:    (2)                                           43LUCINNIUSTake it... do it...

     Lucinnius' voice is fading now. Hector waits, then
     reaches down for the knife in Lucinnius' stomach. We
     see on his face the effort as he pulls at it, and do we
     detect a subtle twisting of the blade to speed Lucinnius
     on his way? Lucinnius sighs and twitches a little. It's
     as if the life flows out of him as the knife is released
     from the wound. His voice is even more faint.LUCINNIUSDo it, Hector... do it... do it...
     Hector has the knife in his hand, but still he waits,
     looking at Lucinnius, willing the last dregs of life from
     him.LUCINNIUSDo it... do it... do it...
     The whispers fade to a croak. Lucinnius lies still.
     Hector has won this final battle of wills. He stands    up,
     suddenly repulsed by what has happened. But quickly    he
     gathers his wits. He makes his decision. He throws     the
     knife down. It clatters along the hard shiny floor.
     Hector has run out of the room before it has come to    rest
     against the wall.44   INT. STUDY - NIGHT                                          44Hector runs into the study and makes for the box contain-
     ing the coins. He puts most of them into a leather money
     bag and ties it to his waist. Then he pulls on
     Lucinnius's cloak and rushes out of the room. He returns
     quickly to pick up his certificate of freedom from the
     table. Then just as he is leaving, he again stops, sits
     down on the chair, pulls off his worn shoes and places on
     his feet a pair of Lucinnius's stout street sandals.45   EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT                                      45Hector is walking quickly from the kitchen across the
     courtyard to the street gate. Near the gate he stops
     and looks back at the house. He makes a decision and
     retraces his steps across the courtyard and back into
     the house.46   INT. THALIA'S ROOM - NIGHT                                  46Thalia is sleeping in a large pallet bed on the floor
     with two other women. Hector gently shakes her shoulder,
     trying not to wake the others. After a moment or two
     Thalia opens her eyes.(CONTINUED)35.46   CONTINUED:                                                     46Hector whispers to her before she has time to open her
     mouth.HECTORI'm leaving... come now if you
                  want to... but we must hurry...
                  I'm a free man... I'm free.
                  Will you come?47   EXT. HARBOR - NIGHT                                            47The shadowy cloaked figures making their way down to the            *
     harbor are Hector and Thalia.                                       *

     Nearer the harbor we sense the nighttime work of loading
     and preparing ships for the morning tide. By the light
     of oil lamps cargos are manhandled aboard, voices shout,
     WINCHES CREAK. Hector encounters a night WATCHMAN, but
     diverts his suspicion by boldly addressing him.HECTORI have some mail for Tyre... where
                  are the east-bound ships?WATCHMANAsk at the harbor.                                     *
     With an authoritative nod, Hector strides off in the
     direction of the noise and lights, Thalia at his heels.
     Hector talks when the Watchman is out of earshot.HECTORWe want a timber ship... they go
                  west... straight to Rome...THALIAAnd then?   Then you go home?                          *
     Hector hurries on, noncommittal in his reply.HECTORYou can go to anywhere from Rome.48   EXT. QUAY - NIGHT                                              48Hector and Thalia approach a ship heavily laden with
     timber. Final supplies are being carried aboard, super-
     vised by two men on the quay. Hector approaches them.HECTORWhere is the Captain?(CONTINUED)36.48   CONTINUED:                                                 48CREWMANHe's on the ship.

     He indicates a man standing on the rear deck. Hector and
     Thalia climb up the gangplank and approach him.HECTORGood morning, Captain... I'm
                  looking for passage to Rome, for
                  both of us...CAPTAINAnd who might you be?HECTORI'm the steward of Lucinnius the
                  merchant... we have business in
                  Rome... I need an immediate
                  passage...CAPTAINIt's five or six days... to                        *
                  Brundisium... you can walk or ride
                  from there... you have money?HECTOROf course.*CAPTAINWell, let's see... passage for
                  two... food for two... six days...
                  what were you thinking of offering?HECTORWhen do you leave?CAPTAINAnxious to leave, are you?HECTORKeen to start, yes.49   INT. SHIP - DAY                                            49Hector and Thalia are asleep, huddled together in a cor-
     ner of the ship that they have claimed as their quarters.

     A CREWMAN comes and shakes Hector awake. He stirs himself
     to the sounds of a SHIP UNDERWAY, the sounds of the SEA-
     WASH, the WIND in the CANVAS, the MOANS of the TIMBERS.CREWMANCaptain says to come on deck.
     Hector wakes Thalia and they clamber out of the darkness
     of the hold onto the brightest, freshest of days at sea.37.50   EXT. SHIP - DAY                                             50There is no sign of land behind them. The ship is moving
     swiftly in a strong, clean breeze and a light sea. We
     can tell from Thalia's reactions that she has never been
     out at sea before, at least never above deck. Every-
     thing is novel to her and it shows, even the movement of         *
     the ship. Her excitement is childlike.THALIAWhere's the land gone?*Hector, too, is taken by the novelty of it all but is
     less prepared to admit it. He waves his hands around the
     empty horizon noncommittally.THALIAHave you been on a ship before?HECTORYes, of course.
     We can tell he is lying.THALIAMe, too, but they kept us down
               there.
     She points down into the lower depths of the hold.   Then
     she gets even more excited.THALIATonight... we'll be where the
               thunder is!
     They look at each other and then all around them. The
     freshness of the day and on an overwhelming feeling of
     freedom, exhilarate them. Their senses and their
     feelings, are in new territory. They are like children
     in a brand-new world.
     The Captain on the other side of the ship, beckons them.         *CAPTAINThought you would like to see
               them.

     He points to three shapes in the mid-distance, ships
     heading for the port they have left. There is a thrill           *
     in their glamor, their fine progress under full sail.CAPTAINYour master's ships... going
               home...*(CONTINUED)38.50   CONTINUED:                                                      50HECTORNo... they can't be... they're

                  master of the big one with the
                  brown sail...
     Hector and Thalia look at each other. The Captain smiles
     at them and looks back to the ships, coursing healthily
     on their way.CAPTAINSomebody been putting the wind up
                  Lucinnius? That's an old one...

     and Hector are sitting on deck, some distance from one
     another. They are quieter now, more thoughtful. Hector               *
     catches her eye. Hector is drawn by her smile and moves              *
     to join her. They sit quietly, absorbed in thought,
     thoughts of each other, their looks and smiles tell us
     that. As if they are talking without words. Hector
     looks around him. A sailor on the forward deck is
     sorting out some rope, an echo of a previous time and                *
     place. The wind catches the sailor's hat. He grabs it
     from the air and spends time arranging it once more on
     his head, just so. A tiny human moment.                              *52   EXT. WAGON - DAY                                                52A man is driving a heavy two-horse wagon. The wind has
     just lifted his hat from his head. He spends some time
     replacing it carefully, just so. Watching him from the
     back of the wagon is Hector.
     The drama of the lives of Thalia and Hector      has played
     itself out long ago. Between the breath of       sea breeze
     that lifted the hat of the Roman sailor and      the gust of
     mountain wind that snatches the hat of the      wagoner, lies
     1400 years.                                                          *

     Hector sits   in the wagon beside a woman. There are
     tantalizing   similarities between their situation and the           *
     one we left   Thalia and Hector in on the boat a few
     moments ago,   1400 years ago.(CONTINUED)39.52   CONTINUED:                                                      52The woman and Hector exchange glances now and then,
     delicate signals of mutual awareness. Talking without
     words.
     They are not alone in the wagon, perched on its half load
     of timber. With them is a NUN accompanying a GIRL of
     about eight. The Girl is tearful. A man, his face
     unseen, is snoring underneath his hat. A younger man,
     gaunt and hungry-looking, is dressed in the rough
     travelling clothes of a monk or PRIEST. Even without his
     habit we would know he was a holy man. His incessant
     talk tells us.PRIESTWe want to praise God because we
                  live in this ultimate age, when
                  all things are done, all is known,
                  all the wonders of his creation
                  revealed to us... nothing more for
                  man to see or do... all that is
                  left is the hope of salvation...
                  even for our humbler sisters...
     The Girl is sobbing through all of this.PRIESTYes weep, child, weep for joy...
                  you are a glorious example to us
                  all... already a child of God's...
                  blessed to spend your earthly days
                  within his church as Christ's
                  servant... what generous parents
                  you have... giving you to the
                  sisters... What a sacrifice.                            *
     There is an Irish lilt to his voice which colors what                *
     he is saying with a tinge of mischief. He is a difficult
     fellow to pin down. Hector looks at him amusedly, still              *
     sharing his thoughts silently with the woman, BEATRICE.
     The Nun interrupts the Priest cheerfully.NUNShe's already received the last
                  rites, before she left her family.
                  She belongs to God now... Don't you?                    *

     The child sobs more noisily.                                         *PRIESTFortunate child, destined for
                  paradise. Untouched by the

                  with any woman...
     He looks accusingly at Beatrice.                               *PRIEST... I will carry my unspilt seed
                  from this world to the next... as
                  should every man...

     Now Hector is getting the hard looks from the Priest.PRIEST... If all men forsook forever the
                  fleshy temptations... and held
                  womankind to barrenness... think
                  how much the sooner would come the
                  day of judgement... all God's
                  chosen gathered in paradise... I've               *
                  written a small treatise in favor                 *

                  discuss it later if you like...                   *

     The DRIVER of the wagon turns his head briefly to the
     Priest.DRIVERWhat are you talking about?
     Hector gestures to Beatrice that he is leaving the wagon
     to walk for a while and asks her to join him. She shakes
     her head with a smile. Hector smiles, too, then jumps
     down from the wagon and, walking slowly, allows it to
     gain ground in front of him. The ramblings of the Priest
     fade away.PRIESTIt's simple, brother... if we
                  cease carnal union entirely then
                  in fifty or so years we'll all be
                  rid of our earthly lives and God
                  can proceed with His reign over
                  His heavenly kingdom... that same
                  paradise that God gave to man
                  before, but which man was so unfit
                  to inhabit that within seven hours
                  Eve was already tempting her
                  master and mate, and within nine
                  hours the Lord had to expel the
                  both of them! Just think, they                    *
                  messed it up in nine hours!                       *41.53   EXT. MOUNTAIN TRACK - DAY                                 53Hector smiles as the Priest's VOICE FADES into the dis-
     tance. It is a  cold fresh day of early summer. They are       *
     travelling high in the mountains. Hector dawdles on
     his way, eating a hard biscuit he takes from his pocket.
     The last sound he hears from the wagon is the renewed
     WAILING OF the GIRL. Hector lays himself down at the           *
     side of the road. His eyes begin to close. Then a SOUND
     in the distance makes him open them again. He listens.
     MORE SOUNDS drift up to him from the floor of the valley.
     He stands up and crosses the track. At first he can see
     nothing. He walks back along the rim of the road. Then
     he sees where the noise is coming from. A mounted
     skirmish is in progress, just where a wooden bridge
     crosses the small river, at the very bottom of the valley.
     There are no more than 30 knights in full armor, with
     twice as many foot soldiers and squires. Even from such
     a distance Hector can see and hear that the fighting is
     ferocious, almost insane in its intensity. From this
     distance it is like a puppet show, except the violence
     is real. The scene places Hector in his time and for us
     there is a strange feeling to it, almost as if Hector
     has awoken from sleep and found himself transported to
     some distant age. But this is not the case. Hector is
     where he belongs, in Medieval Europe.
     Hector makes his decision. With a last look behind him         *
     he runs off in the direction of the wagon. Like any wise
     citizen of a violent age, Hector knows when to leg it.54   EXT. WAGON - DAY                                          54Hector catches up with the moving wagon and jumps onto
     it, happily back in the security of his fellow                 *
     travellers. He smiles at Beatrice.                             *HECTORA bit cold... walking...
     She smiles at him. He sits opposite her in the wagon,
     and allows his foot to touch hers. She doesn't move
     away. Hector calls to the Driver.HECTORHow long to get there?DRIVERWhen it gets dark, we'll be there.                   *

     Hector looks at Beatrice.(CONTINUED)42.54   CONTINUED:                                                     54HECTORI thought I heard fighting... back
                  there...
     Beatrice replies, but in a language that Hector doesn't
     understand.BEATRICEI don't know what you're saying...
                  I haven't understood anything
                  you've said all day...

     Hector talks back to her.HECTORI don't know what you're saying...

     They both smile. It doesn't seem to disturb them too
     much that they don't share a language. They repeat                  *
     their incomprehensible statements, just for the fun of
     it.BEATRICEI don't know what you're saying.HECTORI don't understand.
     Beside Hector the Girl has stopped sobbing but she is
     still troubled. She turns to him and speaks quietly but
     with determination.GIRLI want to go home to my mother.
     Hector doesn't know how to respond. He can do nothing               *
     to help her, and anyway, is more interested in Beatrice.            *55   EXT. FARMYARD - NIGHT                                          55It is almost dark when the wagon finally turns into the
     yard of the farm where they will spend the night.56   INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                         56The Farmer and his Wife have laid out a table with
     simple food, a stew, bread and wine. The travellers settle
     down to eat. The Priest, however makes a performance out
     of his more modest needs. He calls loudly to the wife
     working at the open fire.(CONTINUED)43.56   CONTINUED:                                                     56PRIESTJust bread and water for me,
                  Mistress. I have no need of wine
                  or meat.
     She brings him a jug of water and he makes much of giving
     thanks to God for his simple meal, muttering his grace
     quietly to himself, excluding all others from his conver-
     sation with the Almighty.57   INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                         57In the dark, sleeping bodies lie all over the floor of an
     upstairs room. Gentle snores and regular breathing lay a
     blanket of soft sound over the human forms.

     One of the forms stirs and sits up on one elbow. Hector,
     in another corner of the room, sleeping lightly, becomes
     aware of this. He watches as the figure stands up and
     picks its way between the bodies to the door. The figure
     pauses and crouches over Beatrice. Hector can hear the
     distinct sounds of the figure sniffing her, from head to
     toe, and then a deep, long sigh. The figure stands up and
     moves quietly to the door, disappearing downstairs.
     Hector rouses himself and follows the other.58   INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                         58Hector creeps cautiously into the dark kitchen. The                 *
     figure has gone to the pantry and can be heard RUMMAGING
     there. Hector creeps closer and sees that it is the
     Priest. He already has a chicken leg between his teeth
     as he hunts for a cup for the jar of wine tucked under
     his arm. He emerges from the pantry. He sees Hector
     standing by the table. They recognize one another and
     relax. The Priest doesn't re-enter his holy act. He
     speaks normally, cheekily.PRIESTGod, I'm starving. Do you think
                  I dare heat that up on the fire?

     He indicates the large pot containing the remains of the
     stew.PRIESTNo... I'll eat it cold... I
                  deserve to suffer.

     He pours some wine into the cup and slides it across the
     table to Hector.(CONTINUED)44.58   CONTINUED:                                                       58Then he digs his hands into the cold stew and eats chunks
     of meat as they talk.PRIESTHave some wine.

     Hector takes a drink.HECTORI saw some fighting today... back
                  up the road...PRIESTSo, the mad knights are at it
                  again... what were they, Swiss
                  or English?HECTORI don't know.    They all look the
                  same to me.PRIESTIt might help us get through...
                  if there's a bit of confusion...
                  we'll still travel separately
                  though, for now.
     The Priest changes his tone of voice, mocking his own
     holy act.PRIESTBut, Hector, you must keep out
                  of the way of temptation... I saw
                  the way you were eyeing up that
                  widow... now stay away from
                  that... although she is beautiful,
                  is she not... but we're going
                  home, remember.
     Hector is smiling.HECTORHow do you know she's a widow?PRIESTLook at her eyes... hungry eyes...
                  she could lead you into trouble...
                  she smells like paradise, though.
     He changes his tone yet again.       He talks straight.(CONTINUED)45.58   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                  58PRIESTListen, Hector, let's get this
                  clear... if anyone's going to dally
                  with that widow it'll be me... you
                  couldn't handle her... she'd
                  bewitch you... at any rate, you're
                  not a sinning kind of fellow, are

                  the road tomorrow, and I'll catch
                  you up, in five or so days...

     Hector doesn't answer, but smiles. The Priest has
     stirred thoughts that he had intended to dampen entirely.PRIESTYou're not a sinning fellow,
                  remember... another month and
                  we'll be at the channel, then

                  talk about when you're drunk...
                  don't forget them...
     Hector still remains silent.        The Priest is worried.PRIESTWhy do I always talk so much...
                  you weren't even thinking of her
                  'til I opened my mouth... but I
                  trust you... don't worry. I know

                  your God, or me. Get me some
                  bread.
     Hector obeys the Priest without thought.        The Priest is           *
     happier now that he is in control again.PRIESTWho saved your neck in Venice?HECTORYou did, Ronald.

     Hector approaches the Priest with the bread.PRIESTAnd don't you forget it.

     He raises his cup to Hector.PRIESTMay the Lord forgive us our sins,
                  those we have committed and those
                  we as yet only dream of. She's
                  a glory of a woman.(CONTINUED)46.58   CONTINUED:    (3)                                              58For all his wit and endless talk we can sense a trace of
     vulnerabililty in Ronald. For all his bluster, there is
     the feeling that he needs Hector as much as he claims
     Hector needs him.59   EXT. FARMYARD - DAY                                            59Overnight, the remnants of a company of soldiers, fresh             *
     from battle, have collected in the courtyard. Some are
     tired, dispirited, others are wounded. Our Travellers               *
     watch from the farm window. A few mounted knights come
     into the yard, herding in front of them a small group of
     prisoners, well-dressed knights and squires.60   INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY                                           60The travellers look out on the exciting scene, and talk
     as they eat their breakfast of bread and milk.PEDLARHostages, too, they've got... they
                  only take the rich ones...
     He turns to the forlorn Girl.PEDLARHave you ever seen so many fine,
                  rich men, my girl?
     Hector talks to the company, but means his words for the
     Priest.HECTORI won't be travelling today.

     The Priest looks him straight in the eye.PRIESTThe fighting's behind us, brother
                  ... you'll be safe enough.
     Hector shakes his head, catching Beatrice's eye.HECTORI'll stay.PRIESTYou should go.

     The Nun puts an arm around the Girl.(CONTINUED)47.60   CONTINUED:                                                      60NUNWe're going. God will protect
                  his ewe lambs.                                          *
     Suddenly the door is thrown open and four SOLDIERS man-
     handle an inert body, dressed in full armor, into the
     room. They scatter the food from the table and lay out
     the MOANING suit of armor on it. A young SQUIRE follows
     them in and kneels by the knight in the suit. The MOANS
     are MUFFLED because the knight's helmet has been battered
     out of shape in the battle and can't be removed. The
     ugly dent suggests an equally ugly wound inflicted on the
     head inside. The Soldiers gingerly try to remove the
     helmet. Their efforts are useless. Blood oozes from the
     joints of the helmet. The MOANING suit of armor seems
     inhuman, robot-like.SOLDIERMust be sore in there.   Is it your
                  dada?
     The Squire looks at him and nods his head.       Hector looks        *
     with sympathy at the boy.                                            *SOLDIER #2If he's got a little head it might
                  be alright. Has your dada got a

     An OFFICER comes into the room.OFFICERIs there a blacksmith here?
                  Where's the smith?FARM WOMANIn the village, sir, half a day
                  away.
     The Officer looks at the moaning suit of armor, then at
     the astonished group of Travellers. He picks on the
     Priest.OFFICERYou, Priest, come here... get to
                  work on him... he's not ready for
                  heaven yet... there's a hundred
                  thousand livres on his head if I

                  praying... there's fifteen livres

     The Priest obediently goes up to the knight and starts to
     pray earnestly. The Officer turns to the Soldiers.(CONTINUED)48.60   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              60OFFICERGet that helmet off... get

                  the valley and fetch an armorer.

     The Soldiers scatter to   carry out their orders. Hector            *
     takes time to watch the   Squire still kneeling beside his          *
     father, quietly stroking   the helmet. Ronald the Priest
     mutters every prayer he   can remember. The suit of armor
     twitches and MOANS.

     Hector looks at Beatrice and motions for her to follow
     him outside. The Priest looks on helplessly as they
     slide past the table and head for the door.61   EXT. FARM - DAY                                                61More soldiers have continued to make their way to the
     shelter of the farm. Everywhere is the chaos of war.
     Wounded men lie awaiting the attentions of either the
     medicos or the priest. Prisoners huddle in cowed groups.
     Everyone looks for food. Individual soldiers, like lost
     souls, run here and there trying to regroup with their
     comrades. The youngest are squires of twelve or thir-
     teen, the oldest are red-faced, overweight knights in
     expensive armor.

     Hector and Beatrice have found a quiet corner where they
     can sit and talk. Behind them is a group of soldiers,
     reserves who have not yet joined the battle. They are
     much fresher than the rest and are drilling as a disci-
     plined unit.
     Their movements are a strange cross between parade ground
     drill and battle training. To the BEAT of DRUMS they
     perform rhythmic, hypnotic movements, repeating the same
     pattern over and over again. A deadly dance, thrusting
     their pikes in unison. They become like one evil,
     inhuman machine. It is mesmerizing to watch, all the                *
     more so in relation to the coy seduction scene that Hector
     and Beatrice are acting out. They have the problem of not
     sharing a language, but, resourceful as lovers are, they
     soon employ this as another titillating element in their
     love-play.HECTORI think you know what I'm saying

     Beatrice smiles. In this tiny victory the dynamic of
     their relationship is set.BEATRICEThat's it... clever boy!

     They fall silent, suddenly shy. Beatrice breaks this             *
     moment by reaching out to Hector's neck, very delicately,
     like a caress. Hector smiles. There first touch. Then            *
     it changes. Beatrice completes her movement with a sharp
     grab at Hector's hair, and pinches her fingers on something.

     armor. The boy Squire still sits by his father's head.
     Ronald mumbles quietly to himself in prayer. The knight
     is deathly still, no sight or sound of breathing or
     moaning. The suit of armor seems to grow even more rigid
     as we look at it. There is no sense of it containing
     life. The Officer re-enters the room from outside.OFFICERHow is he?PRIESTSleeping now... at peace, for the

     trees and by a low wall. Some bushes hide them from
     full view of the farm yard. Hector is sitting cross-
     legged and Beatrice kneels behind him, giving his head
     a thorough going over. Mutual grooming is the original,
     and perhaps the best, form of foreplay. Hector certainly
     likes it.BEATRICEThat's four.HECTORYes, it does feel good.

     Beatrice loosens her clothing to bare her neck and
     shoulders. Hector begins to probe her hair and scalp.            *
     She arches her back under the first touch of his fingers.
     Hector laps it up, inspired to caress ever more tenderly         *

     looking for fleas.HECTORGot one... a tiny little one...

     out in a corner of the farmyard. Whether he is a bogus
     priest or not, Ronald is taking his duties seriously.
     There is a little of the rogue about him now. He sees
     the Nun and the little Girl preparing to leave. They
     have acquired a mule. They mount up, the Girl behind
     the Nun, and plod off through the farmyard. They stop
     briefly beside the Priest to say their farewells.PRIESTGoodbye, little girl... the Lord
                  will bless you, I know, in his
                  house.

     The Priest watches them go, and then returns to his
     duties with the wounded.65   EXT. TRACK - DAY                                            65The Nun's mule turns out of the farmyard and heads off
     along the track. A few Soldiers are burying some of
     their dead nearby. The Nun watches this and doesn't see
     what the Girl sees on the other side, the mingled bodies
     of Hector and Beatrice, all pretence at grooming now
     gone, engaged in fervent lovemaking. It's probably the
     first and last that the Girl will see. A smile flickers
     across her face before she turns away forever. Ahead of
     her there might be many a bleak night in her convent
     when she will remember the image, and that same smile
     will return to her lips.66   EXT. FARMYARD - DAY                                         66The Priest is kneeling beside a young wounded Soldier.
     He is close to death, but in his youth is fighting it.
     He is frightened, and clings to the presence of Ronald.SOLDIERMy name is Peter... don't forget
                  ... tell everybody that was my
                  name... Peter...

     own annihilation.PRIESTPeter...

     Ronald behaves well with the dying boy.55.67   INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                     67The Priest makes his way upstairs in the darkness. He
     yawns, a long, contented yawn. He has completed the
     hardest day's work that he has undertaken as a priest,
     if he really is a priest. If he is not, then the pre-
     tence has been just as exhausting. He wants to sleep.68   INT. FARMHOUSE - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT                     68In the room sleeping forms lie here and there in the
     darkness. Some officers have moved in and the place is
     more crowded than before. The Priest makes his way to
     his corner, but on the way he pauses by Beatrice. She
     snores lightly. The Priest bends over and takes a long
     sniff at her, then he sighs out his admiration.

     He steps over her and settles into his own space by the
     window. He suddenly misses the presence of Hector. He
     looks again at Beatrice, still and sleeping. What the
     Priest doesn't see is the extra pair of hands massaging
     her neck and head. She moans softly in her pretence of
     sleep.
     The Priest is troubled, suspicious, but he doesn't know
     why. He sniffs again, in the general direction of
     Beatrice. The mingled smells that his sensitive nose
     detects perplex him, but he settles down, pulling his           *
     cloak over his head.

     Across the room, Hector's head emerges from the covering
     beside Beatrice. They make love quietly in the dark,
     also enjoying the thrill of confounding the Priest.69   INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY                                       69The Priest wakes up. Outside he can hear the first
     sounds of the day, the murmuring VOICES of Soldiers in
     the yard, the CLATTER OF MILK PAILS. In the room it is
     still semi-dark. The Priest sits up. The others have
     already left, but Beatrice is there, stretching herself
     and fixing her hair. Hector is not with her. She smiles
     at the Priest. Then, in another part of the room, Hector
     emerges from what looks like a pile of clothing, sits up
     and smiles too.HECTORGood morning.
     Hector and Beatrice look at each other. The Priest looks
     at them in turn. Their cheeky act of innocence mocks
     him.56.70   EXT. FARMYARD - DAY                                            70Hector is washing himself by the stream that flows close
     by the yard. He drinks a handful of water for breakfast.
     The Priest sees him from the farmyard and comes to join
     him.                                                                *
     Hector is in a cheerful mood, pleased with himself and
     his success with Beatrice. The Priest is sullen,
     reproachful.HECTORYou're a busy man, what with all
               these souls departing.PRIESTThere's nothing wrong with helping
               someone to die in peace. They
               want me to go with them.HECTORNothing at all.PRIESTAre you staying here?HECTORMoving on, as you told me to...
               we'll meet up, like you said.
               I'll wait for you at the channel.*PRIESTShe'll do you harm. I told    you.
               She might be a witch. Wait    for
               me. I still have the money     from
               Venice. We can be home in    a
               month.HECTORWitch my arse. Stop giving me
               orders.
     Both of them are unhappy now, confusing one another,
     spoiling their friendship.HECTORYou're a strange fellow. Are you
               a priest? Are you jealous?

     The Priest is silent. They are saved from hurting each
     other more. A Soldier shouts down to them from the farm.SOLDIERWe're moving soon, Father.(CONTINUED)57.70   CONTINUED:                                                     70The Priest turns to Hector for what might be the last
     time.PRIESTSo, you're leaving?HECTORYou have work to do here.
     The Priest walks back up to the farm. Hector calls out              *
     what might be an attempt at an apology or simply another            *
     taunt.HECTORI don't understand you.

     The Priest looks back at him briefly, then walks on.71   EXT. TRACK - DAY                                               71Hector and Beatrice have packed their few belongings into
     a shoulder bag. They turn out of the farmyard and walk
     down the main track.
     Hector catches a last glimpse of the Priest being helped
     onto the back of a horse, behind a Soldier. He is ridden
     off in the opposite direction with the rest of the troop.
     Other battles lie ahead to be blessed, and more battered
     bodies requiring comfort.
     Hector and   Beatrice are enjoying the first pulse-
     quickening   flush of their intimacy, and the thrill of
     knowing it   will go further. They chatter freely,                  *
     despite not   sharing a language.HECTORI'm glad we're going the same way.BEATRICEWe'll have to sleep in the hills
                  tonight. Will you keep me warm?
     The damp greyness of the early morning has lifted and the
     sun is shining as they step out onto the higher hills.72   EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY                                            72Hector and Beatrice have stopped to eat. They shelter in
     the fold of a hillside, with a wide stream running some
     way below. Hector feeds Beatrice a piece of cheese from
     his knife.(CONTINUED)58.72   CONTINUED:                                                    72BEATRICEHurry up and finish your wine and
                  then we can make love.
     Hector seems to know what she is saying. He throws down
     his knife and cheese, lying down with her on the grass.
     He kisses her breasts and her body eagerly. He lifts her
     skirts and caresses and kisses her naked legs and thighs.
     She stretches herself out happily, arms spread wide on
     the grass. Hector talks through his kisses.HECTORWhy do you smell so wonderful?
     He lifts his head to let her see him sniffing.                     *BEATRICEOh, you like my smell, do you? I
                  make it from the flowers. I put                       *
                  it here, and there, and there.
     Hector kisses her more. She smiles and turns her head to
     the sky. Then she starts to giggle.BEATRICEI don't believe it... someone's
                  watching us, the dirty devil...
                  don't look... he's down by the
                  water, by the rocks...
     Hector doesn't understand, and keeps on with his kissing.
     Only her persistent giggling makes him stop and look up.           *
     Hector sees him too. Down by the stream a head peering
     over the top of a rock, not even attempting to hide.*BEATRICECheeky devil.HECTORHe's not moving. He must've seen

     looking at the figure.HECTORCome on, we're going that way at

     They move cautiously. When they are closer to it, and                 *
     can see it for what is is, they walk straight for the
     dead body.73   EXT. HILLSIDE - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY                              73   *It is the body of a young squire, handsomely dressed
     in the livery of his master. Such a squire would follow
     his knight into battle, guiding him through the chaos.                *
     But this boy seems to have died a less public, more
     furtive death. He lies leaning against a rock, eyes
     open, an expression something like a smile on his face.
     There is no sign of a wound.
     Hector looks around at the ground.HECTORNo sign of a battle... only a few
                  horses... or just one. He wasn't

                  Look at his shoes.
     There is a sadness about this young death in such a
     lonely place. Hector and Beatrice are open to this sad-               *
     ness, but in their age sentiment was of a tougher strain.BEATRICEWe'll cover his eyes at least...
                  so the crows don't get him. Look
                  at these shoes, though.

     She is already gathering stones.        Hector sees what
     Beatrice is doing.HECTORThat's good of you.

     As he lays him down Hector sees a small, dry wound on
     the boy's side. Beatrice brings her armful of stones and
     starts to build a mound around the squire's head.(CONTINUED)60.73   CONTINUED:                                                    73Hector helps her by gathering stones from the stream.
     Soon they have covered his head completely with stones,
     his body lying exposed.HECTORIt's all we can do. It won't keep
                  the wolves away though.

     Beatrice is still taken by the boy's shoes.BEATRICEHis feet are like mine, you know.
                  I'll give you mine, poor boy, and
                  I'll have yours. I have more

     She looks at Hector.BEATRICEIt's not stealing if I give him
                  mine, is it?
     Hector watches as Beatrice exchanges her old shoes for
     the squire's. They fit her well, and she proudly shows
     them off to Hector. He smiles at her.74   EXT. STREAM - DAY                                             74Later, Hector and Beatrice are enjoying each other
     immensely, making love by the stream. Beatrice hasn't
     removed her new shoes, she likes them so much. She is
     dabbing Hector with her perfume which, he has discovered,
     she keeps in a small bottle kept in a pouch on a chain
     around her neck.*Nearby the corpse of   the squire still lies, its head
     shrouded in stones,   as if absurdly hiding its eyes from
     the antics of Hector   and Beatrice. The old shoes
     Beatrice has placed   on its feet look odd compared to
     the fine uniform.                                                  *

     Hector and Beatrice seem unaware of the strangeness of

     our modern eyes.

     ceremony over the corpse of the squire. She takes a
     handful of dried flowers or herbs from a pouch in her
     bag. Mumbling strangely and quickly to herself, she
     walks around the corpse three times, scattering the
     leaves over the body.
     Hector is fascinated, but a little uneasy. He watches
     from a safe distance. During the few moments that it
     takes, Beatrice seems like a different person.
     Then, all of a sudden, the familiar, friendly Beatrice
     returns. She completes her ceremony by throwing a few

     a hill.(CONTINUED)62.76   CONTINUED:                                                  76If it all feels oddly familiar to us, then perhaps it
     is the memory of a picture in a forgotten story book, or
     an ancient landscape on a gallery wall. Once again in
     the film there is the tantalizing feeling of awaking not
     from a dream, but in a dream.

     The moment passes in the more down to earth concerns of
     Hector and Beatrice.HECTORI have to keep the sun on my back,
                  that's what Ronald said... the
                  sun on my back all the way home...
                  I'll stay on this side of the
                  river...BEATRICEYes, of course... we stay on this
                  side of the river, all the way
                  down... until tomorrow...HECTORI stay on this side...BEATRICEYes... On this side. Then the
                  other.
     They move off, each thinking that they have reached
     agreement. Beatrice starts to sing as they make a                *
     gentle descent into the forests below.77   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                           77Beatrice is milking a stray cow they have found in the
     forest. Hector is watching her, especially her hands.
     She manipulates the udders of the cow deftly, sexily.
     Her hands seem to have sensual personalities all of
     their own. She is chattering non-stop, explaining the            *
     subtleties of milking to Hector. But he can't take
     his eyes or his mind off her thrilling hands. He
     responds distractedly.                                           *HECTOROh yes... oh yes.78   EXT. HILLS - NIGHT                                          78Hector lies by their small fire, watching Beatrice, who
     sleeps by his side. She is dreaming. She mumbles in
     her sleep, whole sentences. She turns this way and that.
     Hector watches in fascination.(CONTINUED)63.78   CONTINUED:                                                   78We feel the echo of another night when a man watched
     someone sleep and dream.

     He handles some of the things spilling from her bag,
     lying beside him. Her dried flowers and herbs, which he
     sniffs, her little bottles and phials. Witches brew? Or
     simply an early version of a cluttered handbag?

     We don't know what is passing through Hector's mind.
     Perhaps he is trying to work out how he came to be lying
     with the strange, wonderful, unknowable creature by his
     side. And how many people have done that through the
     ages, in caves or by campfires, or in suburban bedrooms?
     There are many ways in which we will be able to connect
     with this perplexed, flea-ridden man, far away from home,
     huddling by a fire in the forest, trapped in his time, as
     we all are.79   EXT. FOREST - MORNING                                        79Hector and Beatrice are on the move again. They make
     their way down into the thickening forest. Beatrice
     walks ahead, light-footed and humming to herself. She
     seems to be in comfortably familiar territory now. The
     mist swirls about him as Hector follows on behind,
     tagging along as if caught in her sexual wake.80   EXT. BOAT - DAY                                              80Hector and Beatrice have reached the river, broad and
     slow-moving. Beatrice has hailed a boatman from the far
     side. He maneuvers his small boat to them and they
     clamber aboard. Beatrice and the boatman greet each
     other familiarly. They gossip amiably as the ferry makes
     its way across the river. Hector sits quietly with a
     smile on his face, their chatter incomprehensible to him.81   EXT. SHORE - DAY                                             81As they climb out of the ferry Hector is suddenly unsure
     of what he is doing.HECTORI think we're going the wrong way.
                  I want the sun on my back. We
                  should have stayed on the other
                  side.

     He mimes what he means.(CONTINUED)64.81   CONTINUED:                                                      81BEATRICEDon't worry... we're nearly there.
                  I'll fix your back for you... give
                  you a good rub.
     Before he can protest she has moved off.        So he follows
     her.82   EXT. VILLAGE OUTSKIRTS - DAY                                    82They have reached the outskirts of a village. Beatrice
     turns off the main track and up a narrow path. Hector
     follows her. Soon she stops at a small house close to
     an orchard. The house sits in the mess of a run-down
     farm yard, chickens and goats running here and there.

     Beatrice opens the door of the house and goes inside.
     Hector hesitates before following her.83   INT. COTTAGE - DAY                                              83Beatrice turns to him when they are inside.BEATRICEHere we are... home... you want
                  some food... and then I'll show
                  you everything. We have a spring
                  ... you can wash...
     Hector stands looking around the small dark room.
     Beatrice suddenly seems shy and awkward.BEATRICEThis is when I wish you could
                  understand me. You'll have to
                  learn, you know... I want you to
                  stay here. You want to, don't
                  you?

     Hector looks at her in silence.BEATRICEI look after the hens, and I make                       *
                  dyes from the plants, and perfumes
                  too. I'm good at that. But I'm                          *
                  no good with the sheep and the
                  goats. I wish you could
                  understand... Arnaud's been dead
                  two years...                                            *

     She crosses the room to a wooden chest under the window.(CONTINUED)65.83   CONTINUED:                                                     83She lifts the lid and removes some men's clothing, rough
     working trousers and a hide jacket.BEATRICEI still have his clothes.   I'll
                  make them fit you...

     She holds the jacket up against Hector to measure it.
     Hector's reaction to a dead man's clothing is                       *
     predictable.                                                        *HECTOR                                   *What did he die of?                                    *BEATRICEI'm getting shy. Imagine me being
                  shy with you... I made this for
                  him... tonight we'll try them on.
                  You're the same height as Arnaud,
                  but a little thinner. I'll make
                  them fit. I'm a good sewer. And
                  we have a big bed upstairs for
                  you and me, in the rafters... You
                  and me... sleep...
     Hector is beginning to understand what she means, but he
     keeps his feelings to himself. Beatrice talks on. Now
     that she has started, she wants to say it all.BEATRICEI like you. You like me too,
                  don't you? We were lucky to meet
                  the way we did. All the men around
                  here are old.                                          *
     Beatrice falls silent, overtaken     by her shyness. Hector
     understands fully what she means     now, but his mind is
     a confusion. He can't respond.       She tries to direct his
     thoughts to the one area she is     sure about.BEATRICECome up and I'll show you the bed...
     She climbs a   ladder nearby and lifts open a trapdoor
     on the wooden   ceiling. Hector climbs up to join her and
     together they   stand on the ladder with their heads poking
     into the tiny   space above.84   INT. COTTAGE - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY                             84   *Beatrice is proud of her bed, a rough mattress on the
     floor covered in some blankets she has probably made
     herself.(CONTINUED)66.84   CONTINUED:                                                      84The bed takes up most of the space of the small attic.
     They look at it together.BEATRICEA good bed, eh? For you and me.
                  We can have fun up here... better
                  than a ditch...

     She laughs. Hector's expression lightens a little too.
     It occurs to him to take up her offer immediately. She               *
     catches his thought, and the moment tingles happily.                 *
     Then from outside they hear voices. Firstly a young Boy
     calling.BOY (O.S.)Mama, are you home?85   INT. COTTAGE - DAY                                              85Beatrice and Hector   descend back in the room. A BOY
     of about eight and   a GIRL of ten are coming in from the            *
     garden. They have    been working outside. Beatrice goes
     to embrace each of   them. Hector's face is a confusion
     once again.GIRLYou were gone a long time.   Who's
                  this?
     The Girl eyes Hector up and down.BEATRICEThis is Hector.
     Beatrice pronounces his name with care.      She stands
     proudly by her children.BEATRICEThese are my children...

     The CREAK of a door makes Hector turn his head.BEATRICE... and this is my mother....

     An OLD WOMAN stands in the main doorway, smiling at
     Hector and nodding her head. She speaks to her daughter.MOTHER (OLD WOMAN)So... you found one, eh?

     Hector stands, surrounded by instant family, and doesn't
     know what to do. Eventually he speaks.                               *(CONTINUED)67.        *85   CONTINUED:                                                     85HECTORIs there water... to drink... to
                  wash?
     He mimes with his hands. Beatrice understands that he
     wants some breathing space. She talks to her son.BEATRICETake Hector to the well... but
                  come here first.

     She takes off the dead Squire's shoes and puts them on
     the Boy's bare feet. He is delighted. He does a little
     dance in them before leaving with Hector.86   EXT. WELL - DAY                                                86Hector stands at the well some way from the house.
     Beatrice's garden is a madness of wild flowers, harvested
     by her for scents and powders. She is a remarkable
     woman, living as she does in the harsh male world of
     her time. The scented air and the dizzy SOUNDS OF the
     BEES almost make Hector swoon. He is experiencing the
     full, heady impact of Beatrice, and it is summed up in
     a full-blown pollen-filled sneeze.
     He drinks at   her well. The Boy is beside him, still
     engrossed in   his new shoes. Hector splashes some water
     on his face   and looks back at the house. He has some
     decisions to   make.87   INT. COTTAGE - DAY                                             87The Mother sits by the window in the nearest thing to
     a comfortable chair that the house has to offer. She
     is working on some lace. Hector enters the room to
     watch her. He smiles and stands shyly at the door. The
     Mother thinks he wants her chair for himself. In a
     flurry of apology she rises, drops her work and motions
     for Hector to have the good seat. He is full of
     embarrassment.HECTORNo, no... sit down... I just came
                  to watch... please... sit...
     He guides the Mother back to the good chair. They
     struggle comically for a while, but eventually she allows
     Hector to settle her there. She mumbles unhappily.(CONTINUED)68.        *87   CONTINUED:                                                    87MOTHERWe can't have this... this was
                  Arnaud's seat... it's yours
                  now... I can sit on the box...
     Hector gently pacifies her.HECTORYou must sit there... look...
                  you need the light from the
                  window... it's your
                  seat... I don't want it... it's
                  yours... I can sit on the box.
     The old woman   allows herself a shy smile. Whether in
     innocence or   mischief, she has secured the best seat in
     the house for   herself. If he stays, Hector will never
     dare rest his   bones in it.88   EXT. YARD - DAY                                               88Hector has retreated to the yard. The Girl is
     boiling some dyes in a cauldron over an open fire. The
     Boy is working at a basketful of flower heads, pulling
     petals and separating the hearts, putting them in a
     large jar of colored liquid.
     Hector is aware of Beatrice watching him. She is
     returning to the kitchen, firmly holding a struggling
     chicken, wings flapping and feathers flying everywhere.
     This chicken is making the supreme sacrifice in
     Beatrice's final effort at total seduction, a wonderful
     meal. Hector is guiltily aware of this as their eyes
     meet briefly.
     Hector takes in   what the Boy is doing and joins in
     the work. The    Boy smiles at Hector's initial clumsiness.
     He motions for   Hector to have a sniff of the jar of
     liquid. Hector    does so.  The smell is heady and pleasant.HECTORAh...
     The Boy says something and points towards his sister.
     She stands by her cauldron, stirring the bubbling liquid.
     Hector goes to watch her work. He looks in the cauldron.HECTORGood color... for cloth?

     Without thinking, Hector leans over the cauldron to
     sniff. A hideous odor assaults him. He backs off.(CONTINUED)69.        *88   CONTINUED:                                                    88HECTORUgh...

     The Girl says something to him, and points to a bucket
     of liquid at her feet. Hector makes out something like
     the word "peepee."HECTORPeepee?
     The Girl nods enthusiastically.      The Boy is sniggering.89   INT. COTTAGE - DAY                                            89Hector sits at the table with Beatrice and her family.
     There is an air of awkward silence, although the Boy
     and Girl look openly at Hector, perhaps assessing him as
     a future father.
     The meal has been served in a communal pot. In Beatrice's
     house there is the luxury of small individual plates.
     The others wait for Hector to begin, but he indicates
     to the old Mother to help herself first. She does, and
     she doesn't stop until her plate is heaped high with
     food. There is definitely some power play going on in
     the old woman's mind, although her face is all innocence.
     Hector submits, taking only a modest portion of food.
     The old Mother's appetite is prodigious. It is comical
     to watch her little frame consume so much, quietly
     and methodically. She is an eating machine.
     During the meal Beatrice and Hector exchange glances. But
     this time their talking without words is a serious affair.HECTORMmmm... good food....90   EXT. COTTAGE - DAY                                            90From the kitchen Beatrice watches Hector in the garden.
     he is making an effort to appear relaxed, but as he
     paces here and there Beatrice knows that he is unhappy.
     She leaves the kitchen to join him.BEATRICETake a walk to the village if
                  you want... you look as if you
                  need a walk...

     Hector opens his heart to her, knowing she will understand
     his feelings if not his words.(CONTINUED)70.90   CONTINUED:                                                        90HECTORI have to leave soon. I can't

                  smell good... wonderful...

     Hector fumbles awkwardly with his bag and then walks
     off down the track. He turns to look at Beatrice.
     She stands outside her house for a long time, watching
     him until he turns onto the main road and OUT OF SIGHT.
     The pain and the awkwardness in   Beatrice and Hector
     are specific, but the scene of   parting is timeless.
     Is this the ten millionth such   parting, or the billionth?
     It is one of them at any rate,   and a sad one.92   EXT. RIVER - DUSK                                                 92Hector has reached the river, but it is already growing
     dark and the boatman has gone for the night. Hector
     sees the boat, dragged out of the water.

     He sits down against the trunk of a large tree.       His              *
     eyes begin to close.                                                   *93   EXT. RAFT - MORNING                                               93Hector awakes. He looks around him. He is on a huge                    *
     raft, made of ship's timbers. We have left our previous
     Hector sitting under his tree 400 years ago. This
     Hector is awakening into what might be a nightmare.
     The huge raft is many smaller rafts lashed together.
     There are over a hundred and fifty people perched on
     them, lying or squatting in sleep. It is early morning.
     The sea is calm around them, but the deep ocean swell is
     still there to remind them of their predicament, menacing,
     like a controlled anger.

     Hector is fully awake now, sitting against some boxes.
     He speaks to ANDRE sitting close by.(CONTINUED)71.93   CONTINUED:                                                   93Andre is Hector's   slave, still bound to him in service
     through shipwreck   and disaster. Our Hector is now a
     master. Andre is    a young Asian. A quiet, capable,
     intelligent man,   but with that same lost look in his
     eyes that Hector   had as a slave. He too is far from
     home.HECTORI had a wonderful dream. I was                       *

                  beautiful clear water. I got up
                  and drank some. I think I ate some                   *
                  raspberries too.ANDREI would like some water.
     Hector looks around him at the squalid mass of distressed
     humanity.HECTOR                                 *God, this is the worst, the worst.                   *

     Some figures rise and an argument takes place, like
     a domestic squabble. We can hear some of their exchanges.WOMANLet me keep him... they said we'll
                  find land in a day or so... you're
                  evil...MANWhen they're dead they go over the
                  side... The place stinks enough
                  as it is...

     There is a flurry of movement amongst the figures, then
     a splash, then a cry of a Woman. The noise has awakened
     others. All over the raft figures are coming awake,
     sitting up, taking in the new day, and the dreadful
     reality of their situation.
     Andre speaks to Hector.ANDREDo you think I'll still see
                  Europe?HECTORI think there's more chance of
                  me eating you, Andre.(CONTINUED)72.93   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             93The more we see     of the people, their costumes, weapons,
     mannerisms, the     easier we will place them in their
     time. They are      survivors of a foundered ship some time
     at the height of     the great colonial empires. The year
     could be 1590.      The place is the Indian Ocean.

     Hector turns his eyes to another part of the raft,
     closer to him. He watches a man and woman. The woman,
     URSULA, still has her eyes closed, sleeping on a pile of
     canvas. The man, FRANCISCO, stands beside her holding
     a cloak over her to protect her from sea spray. His eye
     catches Hector's, and they hold each other's gaze for a
     long time. There is antipathy but also pain in their
     look.                                                              *

     A man, DOM PAULO, moves among the waking wretches.      He
     speaks with authority.DOM PAULOI think today will be the day,
                  my friends. We've been in the
                  inshore currents since yesterday.
                  Three crowns to the first one to
                  sight the coast. God preserve us
                  all.
     Someone speaks from under a crude canvas shelter.SAILORNever mind the three crowns... a
                  side of beef would do... or a drink
                  of clean water.
     Dom Paulo strides off to his station by the makeshift
     rudder.DOM PAULODon't worry, there'll be food for
                  all ashore. Africa's full of
                  meat and drink.SAILORIt's full of Africans too.94   EXT. RAFT - DAY                                               94The sun is up, and Dom Paulo was right. The raft is
     now standing off-shore riding out the heavy ocean surf
     before finally beaching. The strong are helping to row
     ashore, under the shouted instructions of the NAVIGATOR.
     Those too weak to help are huddled beside their posses-
     sions, hoping to survive this final trial of the sea.(CONTINUED)73.94   CONTINUED:                                                 94Hector works his oar with the rest. He has time to cast
     a glance at Ursula and Francisco. Francisco in his
     manic-heroic way manages to row while at the same time
     trying to offer a steadying arm to Ursula.
     If Hector had time or energy to laugh, he would.

     The raft is in the full rage of the surf. The sense
     behind its loose construction is obvious now. Snake-like
     it rides the waves, one half up, the other down. The
     beaching isn't easy. A few people are washed overboard
     with no way of saving them. Finally the raft makes it
     through the barrier of the outer surf. They are in a
     long curving bay. Up from the beach lies an area of             *
     dunes, and beyond that a thick belt of jungle.

     The raft scrapes onto the sand. Those near the beach
     scramble ashore, immediately prostrating themselves in
     prayers of thanks while those at the back jump into
     the water and clumsily wade the last few feet to safety.
     Hector's attention is never far from Ursula. She is             *
     struggling in the water with some of her baggage. A
     youth, NUNO, goes to help her. Hector overtakes him and
     nudges him out of the way, offering to take Ursula's load
     from her shoulders. She refuses his help. Waist-deep in         *
     water they tussle over her bundle of possessions. Hector        *
     overpowers her, wrestles her load from her grasp, angrily
     wades to the shore and dumps it on the sand. In amongst
     the drama of their situation their little battle of wills
     seems petty and pathetic, but it reveals much about their
     past.*Soon the survivors are dragging their possessions from
     the raft. They have managed to hoard a surprising amount
     from their doomed ship. Carpets, chests, chairs, all
     are dragged ashore.95   EXT. CAMP - DAY                                            95Civilization has taken hold quickly in this little corner
     of Africa. Dom Paulo, the leader, already has a table
     and chair set up in the sand, and behind him SAILORS are
     erectig a tent-like house, made from timbers and rich
     tapestries and carpets. The others are making their own
     shelters all along the beach. A regular little community
     is taking shape, a crazy, rich-textured village decked out
     in all the colors of the East. The silks and ginghams
     that were destined for the finest halls in Europe now give
     shelter to sick slaves, starving sailors, ruined traders
     and grieving mothers.(CONTINUED)74.        *95   CONTINUED:                                                  95Some of the survivors have   recovered sufficiently from
     the trauma of near death to   mark out the boundaries of
     their new beach homes with   lines of stones. The habits
     of ownership die hardest of   all.
     Although Dom Paulo is the man in authority he is also a
     man in deep shock. Most of what he has earned or
     plundered in his colonial years now lies at the bottom
     of the ocean. Since he is socially superior to anyone
     else on the ship he assumes responsibility and command.
     There are probably fifty men among the survivors more
     suited to lead them to safety.
     By Dom Paulo's side always is his SON. A quiet boy of
     about eleven. He is like a little miniature of his
     father, dressed in the same style of clothes. He is a
     constant, silent witness to everything that Dom Paulo does,
     good or bad, wise or foolish. He and his father are a
     continuing fascination for Hector, and we can enjoy
     Hector watching the boy watching his father. Some of the
     absurdities and comedies of the situation can be high-
     lighted in this way. There can be sadness in it too
     however, the pain of a son witnessing his father's
     compromises or failures all too closely, and Dom Paulo's
     sad awareness of his image slowly tarnishing in his
     son's eyes.
     Amidst the construction work, Dom Paulo is talking with
     some of his OFFICERS.DOM PAULOHow many made it?OFFICEREighty men. Ten women. Eighteen
                  children and forty-five slaves.DOM PAULOTwo parties of ten men each... one
                  to the north and one to the south...

                  fruit, anything... and send someone
                  back as soon as you find fresh
                  water. Any trouble, discharge
                  three shots.

     The Officer leaves to carry out his orders.    Dom Paulo
     addresses another of his men, Da Cunha.(CONTINUED)75.95   CONTINUED:     (2)                                             95DOM PAULOHave the carpenter start

     village.  Andre is carrying Hector's possessions, a
     rolled-up carpet and a bolt of colorful cloth. We feel
     an echo of the days when Hector was a slave, walking
     two paces behind with his master's possessions.
     Hector finds what he is looking for. Francisco is
     working on a shelter for himself and Ursula, with the
     help of some slaves. Hector approaches him, making
     another attempt to heal wounds from his past.HECTORI have a carpet and some cloth...
                  I thought if we worked together
                  we could make a better shelter...
     Francisco barely stops his work to reply.FRANCISCOIf it's a joke it's a poor one.                        *HECTORAt least ask Dona Ursula...FRANCISCOI don't have to ask her... I know
                  she would agree with me... leave us
                  alone.
     His stubborn rejection of Hector reveals just how
     strong their friendship once was.HECTORWell... would you take my cloth,
                  at least?FRANCISCOKeep it and build your own hovel
                  somewhere else... leave us

     distracts them. They see some figures, laden       with
     supplies, running off into the forest. Others       are
     following them, discharging MUSKETS, shouting      for the
     DESERTERS to stop. Hector and Francisco walk       briskly
     in the direction of the trouble. They see two       of the
     Deserters being overtaken by their pursuers.       The rest
     make their escape into the jungle.97   EXT. CAMP - DAY                                                97Hector and Francisco reach Dom Paulo's office in the
     sand. The leading citizens are gathering there as
     the two captured Deserters are brought in.SAILORThey ran off with the dry bread...                     *
                  about eight of them, sir...                            *
     Dom Paulo looks at the two prisoners.DOM PAULOYou men are deserters. You will

     He speaks again to the Sailor.DOM PAULOChain them on the raft for tonight,

     Francisco steps forward, outraged.FRANCISCOI must object... these sentences
                  can't be lawful...

     Dom Paulo's authoritative manner vanishes in an instant.
     He becomes hesitant, unsure of himself. As always, his              *
     Son watches every detail of the exchange.                           *DOM PAULODo you think so?FRANCISCOOf course... we can't allow

                  Salgado... and me... that they
                  should die?
     A lot of hands go up. Hector hesitates, his instincts
     are not for killing. But the force of the majority
     weighs on him. He starts to raise his hand. At that
     moment, as he scans the crowd, he meets the eyes of the
     Deserter whose death they are voting on. For a moment
     they communicate. Hector is thrown. He drops his hand,
     only to find in the next instant the stern gaze of
     Salgado on him. He hesitates again, then starts to
     raise his hand. Then the eyes of the Deserter find him
     once more. This comic pantomime goes on while a solid
     majority of the crowd firmly raise their hands.DOM PAULO... and those against death...

     One of the Deserters raises his own hand meekly.DOM PAULOYou can't vote...

     watches him. The tent is only large enough for     one
     person, and somehow looks mean compared with the    others.HECTORGood work, Andre.

     He looks across to the well-made shelter of Ursula and
     Francisco. Ursula herself works at the fire.*Hector turns to Andre.HECTORYou go and sleep by the big fire,

     to the entrance and opens the    canvas sack which contains
     all his possessions. He pulls     out his prize, a sizeable
     chunk of bread and some dried    fruit. He guiltily gnaws
     at the hard bread.
     He is surprised by the sound of the boy, Nuno outside.NUNOSenor Hector?
     Hector quickly stows his food back into his sack, and

     Nuno makes to leave, but then hesitates.NUNOHector, will you help me?

     Nuno is looking down the beach to the remains of the

      engaged in their nightly ritual, practicing on their
      recorders. Dom Paulo leads the young boy through an
      intricate, pretty tune. They sit formally and there is
      an air of stoicism about them, determined as they are
      to maintain their civilized habits in these bleakest of
      circumstances. But there is also a feeling of madness
      about it. The madness of a man who has lost a grip of
      what is going on about him. Down on the beach men are
      waiting to die in the morning on his orders. The blend
      of formality and madness make the scene comic.101   EXT. CAMP - DAWN                                          101The sun has risen sharply, soaring out of the ocean. It
      blinds the eyes of those in the little execution party
      making their way along the beach.
      The cross-cum-scaffold has been erected some way from the
      camp. Most people are  attending to their morning
      chores with one eye on the grim act of justice being
      carried out along the shore.

      Our view of the hangings will be from the distance of the
      camp; marionette figures, men dancing on ropes, the form-
      ality of legal death. The priest and the executioners.
      It takes a while for the people in the camp to become
      aware of the other observers up on the dunes. Three
      figures stand in full view, boldly, silently, watching
      the camp and the pantomime at the scaffold.
      The word passes around the camp. Eyes pass between the
      executions and the tall natives watching.   The first man
      is already dangling on the rope by the time that Dom Paulo
      and his officers are discussing the appearance of the
      natives.DA CUNHASome gunpowder would scatter them,
                 sir.DOM PAULONo, they might want to be
                 friendly... they'll have food
                 too... get one of our African
                 slaves... we must try and talk to
                 them... If they think we're timid
                 we're dead.83.102   EXT. DUNES - DAWN                                           102A solitary SLAVE makes his way up from the camp to the
      natives on the dunes. Everyone in the camp watches as he
      approaches them. There is tension. Will the natives run
      or fight or talk. They begin to talk. The natives seem
      most interested in the hangings, and point in that
      direction, asking questions. The Slave makes an attempt
      at explaining what is happening, but the natives seem
      baffled. They start laughing and shaking their heads.
      By now the second figure is dangling on the rope, the
      cross making an efficient double-gallows.103   EXT. CAMP - DAWN                                            103While Francisco's attention has been on the natives,
      Hector has sidled up to him, still hoping to ingratiate
      himself. He talks while they watch the two events, the
      hanging and the meeting.HECTORI hate it when people have to die.                      *FRANCISCOIt's foolishness. Killing our
                own men when we have the whole of
                Africa to face.HECTORIt's foolish squabbling at all.
                We should be friends.
      Francisco looks at him for the meaning in what he is
      saying. Hector shrugs. He takes a small bundle from
      his jacket and gives it to Francisco.FRANCISCOWhat's this?HECTORSome bread and raisins.FRANCISCOI thought everything was shared
                out on the raft...HECTORWell this wasn't. It's for her...
                and you.
      Francisco looks Hector straight  in the eye, looking for
      his angle. But this time there   is none. Hector is
      simply a lonely man seeking to  retrieve lost friendship.
      There is a glimmer of sympathy  in Francisco's face.(CONTINUED)84.103   CONTINUED:                                                    103On the high dunes the Slave and the natives have now
      parted company. The Deserters still spin at the end of
      their ropes, the Priest praying at their feet.
      Francisco walks away from him.      Hector calls out.HECTORI must speak to her!104   EXT. CAMP - DAY                                               104The Slave approaches Dom Paulo outside his tent.SLAVEThey want to make a visit here...

      and boxes and timber bob in the waves. People make their
      way to the shoreline to retrieve these new gifts from the
      sea.                                                                *
      The whole of the camp is eager and shouting. They bring             *
      in the boxes and barrels. A whole harmonium is man-
      handled ashore. Some boys drag it up onto dry sand and
      start to work its bellows. At first only water spurts
      from it, but then a watery note or two is emitted. The
      mood soon becomes festive. Dom Paulo makes his way down             *
      to the shore to make the celebrations official.                     *
      By now the first of the newly-arrived crates are being
      opened. Inside are eggs, many, many large eggs, in
      crate after crate.
      An OFFICER brings the first of the eggs to Dom Paulo.OFFICERTurtles' eggs, sir... Doctor Correa
                   was shipping them to the Royal

      fires in the dusk they fry them, boil them, scramble
      them. Some eat them raw. The abundant green fruits
      make a tolerable side dish. The happy mood of the
      afternoon has survived into the night. For once there
      is enough to eat, and the hangings are a thing of the
      past. Above the ROAR of the constantly rolling SURF
      the CROAKY sounds of the waterlogged HARMONIUM can be
      heard.                                                           *107   INT. HECTOR'S TENT - DUSK                                  107Sadly for Hector, the harmonium enthusiast is very close
      to his shelter. The JANGLY MUSIC is loud and insistent.
      Hector removes six large eggs from a bag and takes them
      outside to his fire.108   EXT. CAMP - DUSK                                           108Andre is there eating the last of his omelette.HECTORHow are they?ANDREGood.

      Hector cracks one of his eggs into a copper pan. Inside          *

      grunts in annoyance and cracks another egg. The yoke is

      Hector picks up a third egg and shakes itclose to his

      a fourth egg and cracks it open. A small dried-up, half-
      formed baby turtle RATTLES into the pan. Andre is

      from their crates and boxes of valuables. Hector and
      other notables are also there.
      Cheap goods, a box of rosaries and crucifixes made of                *

      Dom Paulo rummages in a box of cheap rosaries, selects a
      couple, and then retires to his tent. The others work
      on at the table. Hector drifts off down to the beach.110   INT. DOM PAULO'S TENT - MORNING                                110Inside his tent Dom Paulo goes to his small mirror. He
      takes off the heavy silver chain and medallion from
      around his neck, and a valuable brooch from his coat. He
      stows them safely in a locked box and replaces it in its
      hiding place in the sand floor. Then he adorns himself
      in the cheap rosary and other trashy items. Dom Paulo,               *
      catching sight of his watching Son in the mirror, holds              *

      is looking for, a piece of wood with some nails still
      attached to it. He pulls out the nails and pockets them,
      then continues to rummage amongst the wood for more.
      Hector is a survivor. And not the first Hector to
      scavenge on a beach, in a world that feels big and empty.112   EXT. DUNES - MORNING                                         112Hector is enjoying the   freshness of the day. We see              *
      him climb over a dune   and then as he nears the summit
      duck and retreat down   the slope again. Cautiously he
      crawls up the dune and   looks over to the other side.

      He is watching a young Girl and the boy Nuno. They are
      twelve or thirteen years old. They are coyly in the
      early stages of making love, the Boy lying close to the
      Girl, kissing her, beginning to caress her. Their                  *
      love-making is poised oddly between child's play and               *
      eroticism. It's their day of discovery and it is like
      a dream of love.
      The Boy is just about to   discover some more and is
      fumbling with the Girl's   clothing, when he looks up and
      catches sight of Hector.    Hector ducks down but knows he
      has been seen and decides   to brazen it out. He stands
      up in full view of them.HECTORStop that... leave her alone...
                   get back to the camp... or I'll tell

                   your help back there...?
      The Boy is standing now and fixing his clothing. He walks
      off back to the camp. The Girl remains sitting in the
      sand, buttoning her dress, too embarrassed even to raise
      her head to Hector.

      Then Hector is touched by something, perhaps the sad stoop
      in the Boy's shoulder or the Girl's lowered head. Hector
      realizes he has broken something precious and in their
      circumstances infinitely fragile and irretrievable. He
      feels like an oaf. He calls after the Boy.HECTORCome back... I didn't mean it...
                   it was a joke... you come back...

      at Hector, who feels foolish and mean. Hector calls down
      to the Girl.HECTORI'm sorry.

      But she doesn't look up, still fumbling with her buttons.
      Hector curses quietly and looks out across the dunes,
      angry with himself. Then he sees the procession of the               *
      Native King and his people, some cattle, and porters
      carrying baskets.
      Hector runs off towards the camp.113   EXT. CLEARING - DAY                                            113The meeting of the two leaders is weird and wonderful                *
      to see. The ragged Europeans, already scanning the                   *
      baskets of the Natives for signs of solid food,
      somehow still muster an absurd sense of their own                    *
      importance for the occasion. The Natives, excited and                *
      curious, trying to contain their exuberance so that they             *
      don't miss a single detail of this most significant
      day. Many of the Natives have climbed into the trees,                *
      either out of timidity or to get a better view                       *

      The trees around the meeting place are dripping with
      bodies, like human fruit.
      Hector slips into the crowd as the NATIVE KING is in
      mid-speech. When he has stopped talking the Slave begins
      to haltingly translate.SLAVEHe was excited when he heard you

      the Officers standing closest to him.DOM PAULORight... you four as well...

      He begins to open up his coat and shirt. The four
      Officers do the same. The King and a few of his atten-
      dants take a step or two forward and peer at the exposed
      white European bellies. They look at one another and
      mumble solemnly. Then they step back. Dom Paulo and the
      Officers fix their clothing and re-muster their dignity.
      The King is enjoying himself.    He speaks again to the
      Slave, who then translates.SLAVEHe wants to see you breathe.
      The King takes a deep breath, then nods to Dom Paulo.
      Dom Paulo and the Officers do as they are told. The King
      joins them, and for a few moments there is a kind of
      communion between them. Then everyone joins in. It is a            *
      strange, poignant moment, all the Natives and all the
      Europeans united in the simple act of breathing.
      Dom Paulo regains his composure.    He speaks to the Slave.DOM PAULOTell him that we want to trade
                   with him, to buy food... and we

      Various Officers raise their eyebrows at this.DOM PAULOOf these precious things, which my
                   fathers and forefathers have worn
                   for many long years before...

      Dom Paulo solemnly and without a blush removes the cheap
      rosary from around his neck and offers it to the King.DOM PAULOI shouldn't do this, but it is
                   such a special occasion, and he is
                   such a great and worthy King...
      This is translated.    The King refuses to accept the               *
      rosary. Instead he    is pointing to a couple of chunky
      and valuable-looking   rings on Dom Paulo's fingers which
      he has forgotten to   remove.SLAVEHe says he could not accept such
                   a treasured gift, something of
                   such value to your family...
                   instead he would be happy to take
                   one or two of the old rings you have
                   on your fingers... but please do
                   not insist that he take your
                   necklace...
      It is impossible to know if the King is being naively
      polite or hugely clever. Dom Paulo's Officers enjoy a
      muted titter as he peels off his precious rings and
      gives them to the King, replacing the worthless baubles
      around his own neck. The King begins talking again.
      The Slave translates.SLAVEHe will give you guides to help                        *
                   you across the first of the big
                   rivers... it is ten days from
                   here...(CONTINUED)93.113   CONTINUED:    (3)                                             113DOM PAULOThank you, thank you...

      The Slave continues.SLAVE... and he asks you to be ready
                   to leave the beach in two days
                   time... he cannot permit you to
                   stay longer...

      Dom Paulo looks shocked.SLAVEBecause with the new moon the
                   turtles will arrive and lay
                   their eggs... you may frighten
                   them... you must be gone...
      The mention of turtles' eggs almost turns the stomachs
      of most of the survivors, even the fit ones.
      The King and his followers walk back into the forest.               *
      Soon the survivors are alone again, with the lost-
      looking cow the Natives have left. A doomed cow if
      ever there was.114   EXT. BEACH - EVENING                                          114The remains of the cow hang on the spit over the large
      fire the survivors have made on the beach. Small groups
      of people sit around it, gnawing on the roasted flesh.
      The image is once again timeless, the elements of it
      simple; man, fire, flesh, food.
      One cow doesn't go far between a hundred starving people.
      Some are still on their feet by the large fire. Now and
      then a hand will dart out over the flames to snatch a
      bone hanging loose or a tasty-looking piece of gristle.
      They are the survivors of the pack, if any will be.

      Hector is, of course, among them. He    risks the searing
      heat to pull at a couple of blackened   bones. He sees
      Nuno, the boy he chased away from the   Girl earlier in
      the day. Nuno is sitting by himself,    staring vacantly
      at the fire, licking his fingers.
      Hector sits down in the sand beside him. Nuno hardly
      notices him until Hector offers him one of his bones.
      Nuno grabs it.NUNOThanks.(CONTINUED)94.114   CONTINUED:                                                     114HECTORSuck out the marrow... it's the
                   best bit.
      Nuno follows Hector's example. Hector allows him to
      feel the benefit of his gift before he starts to talk.HECTORI'm sorry about today...NUNOIt doesn't matter...HECTORBut it does... it was mean of
                   me... I was upset at something...
                   I wasn't really angry at you...NUNOI know.
      Nuno is taking it rather well.      Hector regains his
      natural self-confidence.                                             **HECTORYou don't think too badly of me?NUNONo...HECTORYou still like me?
      Nuno shyly nods his head.*HECTORYou do?NUNOYes.

      Hector is satisfied now.HECTORWell, that makes me feel better...
                   we all have to like each other...
                   and respect each other... that's
                   important too.
      They are silent for a moment.HECTORIf you don't respect me, just
                   say so...(CONTINUED)95.114   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              114Nuno looks at him, smiling weakly. Then he turns away
      in silence. Hector tries another approach to win the
      Boy over.HECTORI have a boy like you... maybe                          *
                   you could meet him when we get
                   home...
      This doesn't produce much of a response. Hector tries
      again. He starts to chuckle to himself and nudges Nuno
      in the ribs.HECTORYou can take her back there
                   tomorrow, eh?

      Nuno shakes his head.NUNONo... she's sick now...115   EXT. CAMP - NIGHT                                              115Dom Paulo and the Priest and some of the Officers are
      having a more formal meal at Dom Paulo's table outside
      his shelter. An argument is in progress between Dom
      Paulo and GASPAR DIAS, the navigator.
      Gasper Dias has drawn a rough map which lies on the
      table.*DOM PAULOCan't you be more accurate?
      Hector comes to the meeting. He sits down on a box
      near the table and watches and listens, his expression
      changing with the shifts in mood of the others. This                 *

                   as we know you can be, Dias. After
                   all, the ship did manage to find
                   that rock with admirable precision.DIASConfound you, Dom Paulo, that's an
                   insult... she hit that rock because
                   she was taking water and
                   unsteerable... She was overloaded
                   before she left India and you know
                   it....
      Dias pounds his fist on the table.DIASI've told   you... we vote for a                         *

      There are mock groans and laughter at the thought of it.
      The tension for the moment is broken.                                 *DA CUNHAWhat about the sick and the

      He passes   close to the tent of Francisco and Ursula.
      Francisco   is outside, by the fire. An impulse takes
      Hector to   join him.HECTORI'll be glad when we're on the
                   move... the sound of the sea is
                   driving me mad.FRANCISCOGood night, Hector...
      Hector lingers.HECTORWhere is Ursula? Sleeping?FRANCISCOSick. She hasn't been able to
                   rise since yesterday.*Hector's face expresses his shock. From what he has
      heard at the meeting this is serious news. He makes a
      decision. He speaks to Francisco, willing their old
      friendship back into existence in the urgency of the
      moment.HECTORWill you share a bottle of wine
                   with me? I've had it since we

      by some miracle has two fine crystal glasses. As they
      drink they begin to reveal a hint of their old intimacy.FRANCISCOYou should hang for this. Some
                   people on the raft might have
                   lived with a glass of this in

      abstinence.HECTORI know. I feel very guilty.    I

      in progress. Every fit member of the camp is there, and
      a good many of the sick have been carried in litters to
      take part. The harmonium has been carried up the hill
      and is in full voice, some youths dissipating their
      precious energy on its bellows. The younger boys have
      been organized into a choir.(CONTINUED)100.118   CONTINUED:                                                     118*The large cross stands behind Father Diogo, held     in place
      by a cairn of piled stones at its base. When we      FIND
      Hector there is something tantalizingly familiar     about it
      all; the cliffs, the ocean, the kneeling Hector,     a pile
      of stones, the offering to a god.*119   EXT. CLEARING - DAY                                           119The natives have gathered nearby. They have been moved,              *
      perhaps by the music, or perhaps by the simple, universal            *
      posture of worship itself. They begin to sing, a low,
      rhythmic, compelling chant. It mingles with the distant
      voice of Father Diogo, and then with the chanting voices
      of all the Europeans, until it seems that the whole
      world is praying.120   EXT. CAMP - MORNING                                           120Next morning the camp on the beach     is being broken up.
      The place is like a junkyard. The      amount of damage that
      a hundred and fifty people can do     to a beach in two days
      is impressive. Dom Paulo and the      officers watch the work.
      With them are some messengers from     the king, and the
      Slave translator.
      One of the messengers is talking.     When he finishes, the
      Slave translates.SLAVEYes... they will look after the

      long line of people, including some local natives, carry
      the sick in crudely-made litters. Even this short trip
      is hard.  Somewhere in the line six sailors manhandle the

      Mother in a   litter. It is like a civilization on the
      move. In a    day or two the wind and the sea will have
      rubbed out   all evidence of their stay, and the bay will
      welcome its   regular tenants, the turtles.124   EXT. NATIVE VILLAGE - DAY                                   124There is a sense of bustle in the native village as the
      European sick are settled into their huts and the others
      prepare to depart. Emotional farewells take place in                *
      dark corners of the small huts. A group of unmoved
      sailors are playing cards in the dirt.                              *

      In amongst the bustle Hector is looking for Francisco.

      watching the small human dramas all around him. Soon
      Francisco emerges from the hut.FRANCISCOIn you go.

      entrance.125   INT. HUT - DAY                                              125Ursula is lying in a darkened corner. Hector is shaken
      by the sight of her, ashen and fevered, but tries not to
      show it. He kneels beside her.HECTORUrsula... it's Hector.

      Her voice is a whisper.(CONTINUED)103.         *125   CONTINUED:                                                       125URSULAGoodbye.HECTORI won't forget you... I won't

      She looks at him but doesn't or cannot speak.HECTORWe should have talked... I could

      She manages a whispered word.URSULALisbon...HECTORYes... I'll pray for you in
                   Lisbon... at the Cathedral...
      She lies still.       Hector lingers for a moment.   Then he
      speaks again.HECTORI'm sorry I hurt your pride...

      Hector has blown it. Ursula pulls herself up on an
      elbow, finding wells of energy from sheer indignation.
      Hector is astonished, almost jumping out of his skin.URSULAWhat? What did you say?    What are
                   you talking about?HECTORNothing, nothing...
      Ursula speaks one word, and then falls back into a dead
      faint.URSULAIdiot!

      She lies still. Hector leans over her to make sure she
      is still breathing. He whispers nervously.HECTORUrsula?104.126   EXT. HUT - DAY                                             126Outside the hut, Dom Paulo is talking with Francisco.DOM PAULOWe won't forget you, or what you

      They shake hands.DOM PAULOWe're leaving the cross with
                you...FRANCISCOOh, thank you...DOM   PAULOIt's too heavy to   carry... and who
                knows... it might   make some
                impression on the   heathens.
      Hector comes out of the hut, solemn-faced.                       *HECTORFrancisco, I must talk to you
                alone...127   EXT. HUT - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY                             127Hector takes Francisco by the arm and leads him behind

                   for you? A letter... a message?                           *
      Francisco laughs softly.FRANCISCONo... if you were carrying                                *

                   empty-handed I can put you out of
                   my mind!
      Hector smiles uncertainly, unsure if Francisco is making
      a joke. Then he becomes more serious.HECTORI want to ask you something.                              *
                   There's no easy way to do it...FRANCISCOGo on, Hector...HECTORYour boots...
      Francisco looks down at his boots.FRANCISCOWhat about them?HECTORCan I have them? You can have
                   mine... they'll be fine for
                   here... but I have to walk six
                   hundred miles...
      Hector lifts a foot to show Francisco his boot. Francisco
      is stunned into silence. But then a smile comes to his                 *
      face.FRANCISCOYes, you're right... I daresay                            *

      Hector becomes almost poetic in his pleading.(CONTINUED)106.127   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             127HECTORI'll walk all the way home,

      Francisco starts to laugh out loud.FRANCISCOHector, you have surpassed
                   yourself... sit down and take my
                   boots!
      Francisco starts to take off his boots. Hector does the             *
      same. He can't believe his luck. At this moment, he                 *
      loves Francisco. He makes nonsensical small talk,
      hopping around on one foot.HECTORThey were made by Da Fosca,

      Francisco is laughing, but Hector doesn't get the joke.*128   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                             128A different forest. A wilderness of giant pines, ranging
      through the mountains for hundred of miles. It is late              *
      in the year. There is one human sound in the cold still-            *
      ness, a voice singing.
      BOBBY, the owner of the voice, has a pack on his back.              *
      He is making his way up a steep slope to an area of flat
      ground. He stops singing, looks around, and calls out               *
      in a powerful voice.                                                *BOBBYThey've gone... long gone!

      Bobby looks around the abandoned camp, the dead fires,              *
      cleared areas for tents.(CONTINUED)107.         *128   CONTINUED:                                                     128Up the slope and INTO VIEW comes his companion, leading
      a laden pack horse. It is Hector.HECTORHow long?BOBBYThey've been gone a week, at
                   least.HECTORDamn them...BOBBYWe're ten days late...

      They look at each other.      They are in trouble, and now
      they know it.BOBBYCheer up. Have a look around.
                   I'll start on a fire...129   EXT. CAMPSITE - DAY                                           129Hector has scoured the campsite.      He holds up a canteen
      he has found.HECTORIt's Sandy's... whiskey...BOBBYWell done, my lad!
      Hector walks to the fire, pleased with     himself. Bobby
      unfolds his fist and looks at what he     has found, an
      Indian arrowhead with a few inches of     broken shaft. He
      folds his hand over it again, keeping     his secret.
      Behind them, nailed to a tree, is a plaque their
      companions have left. It reads, "Pennsylvania Boundary
      Expedition 1761, Marker 152." Also on the plaque someone
      has written, "We left here, 20th October."130   EXT. CAMP - NIGHT                                             130Hector and Bobby sit by the fire with their supper.      They
      are both anxious, but pretend not to be.(CONTINUED)108.         *130   CONTINUED:                                                 130BOBBYEven if we lose their track, we'll
                   still hit the river... we can't
                   miss that.HECTORIt's too high for Indians?BOBBYMuch too high. You won't find an
                   Indian up here. We just have to
                   keep our heads... no panic.HECTORIf you did find an Indian, what
                   would he be?BOBBYYou wouldn't... but he might be a
                   Delaware if you did.HECTORWe keep working?BOBBYWhy not. We can log the peaks on
                   the far side, just a couple of
                   sightings a day... keep us busy...

      Their forced tone of matter-of-factness only serves to
      heighten the growing feeling of doom.HECTORYou think we'll get out?BOBBYIf we keep our heads.   I wish I
                   had some tobacco.131   EXT. CAMP - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT                        131Hector is lying awake, watching Bobby's sleeping form on
      the ground at the other side of the dying fire. Behind
      Bobby is a wolf, sniffing and edging his way closer to
      them. Hector isn't anxious. He knows the wolf will soon
      become aware of them and move off. He is worried about
      something else. From under the pack that makes his
      pillow he pulls a piece of broken arrow, a shaft and some
      feathers, the other end of Bobby's find. He looks at it,
      then looks back to Bobby and the wolf.109.132   EXT. CAMP - MORNING                                        132In the morning Hector and Bobby are taking readings from
      the instruments they have hung on a large tree, main-
      taining the disciplines of their work. It gives some
      shape and meaning to their predicament.BOBBYBarometer... twenty-eight and
                three-eighths... temperature...                        *
                low... thirty-four... high...
                forty-two and a half... time...

      Hector writes it in the log book. Bobby goes to the              *
      horse and takes a brass chronometer from a box strapped
      to the saddle. Hector takes out a smaller chronometer
      from his own pack. They compare readings. There is a
      difference of some four or five minutes in the time.BOBBYIt's getting worse... you're
                nearly five minutes fast now...HECTORI'm not fast... you're slowing
                down.
      They obviously have this tiff every morning.HECTORWhat's the point of having two
                chronometers when you don't take
                the average?BOBBYExactly... you should throw yours
                away.HECTORYou're unscientific, Bobby... at
                heart...
      Hector writes in the book.   He speaks pointedly.HECTORSeven twenty-five...

      Bobby mocks him with a laugh.                                    *133   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                          133Bobby is leading the horse and Hector walks on ahead.            *
      The going is easy through the ferns and grasses. Bobby           *
      for a moment forgets his apprehensions and starts to sing
      loudly.(CONTINUED)110.         *133   CONTINUED:                                                    133BOBBYI see her in the dewy flowers
                   I see her sweet and fair...
      His voice rings sharply around the forest. Hector far
      ahead turns around, taken by surprise. Bobby has
      frightened himself too. He eyes the forest all around
      as the echo of his voice fades. Chastened, he begins
      to sing again, quietly this time, under his breath.BOBBYThere's not a bonny bird that sings
                   But minds me o' my Jean...134   EXT. CLEARING - DAY                                        134Hector and Bobby have stopped at a point of bare rock
      looking out across the broad valley.
      They are building a pile of stones, a cairn. They work
      quietly, methodically. The only sounds are of their
      breathing and the CLICK-CLACK of the stones. We feel the
      echoes of our many previous Hectors and their piles of
      stones, built for this or that purpose. Our doomed
      surveyors are acting out the same ritual, this time in
      the name of science.
      They finish the cairn and erect their heavy tripod over
      it, and dangle a plumb line from the tripod. Bobby
      scratches the center point on the top stone of the cairn.
      They are establishing a survey point. They talk as they
      work.

      When they anchor their   tripod, the cold hard sound of
      their CHISELS STRIKING   ROCK ECHOES all through the forest.
      It unnerves them. They    stop hammering and listen to the
      ECHO BOUNCING down the   valley.HECTORSure this is a good idea.BOBBYLet's get out of here.

      They hastily dismantle the equipment and load up the
      horse, in an atmosphere of controlled panic.135   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                          135They are travelling together now, on either side of the
      horse's nose, finding comfort in the closeness of each
      other. They stop for Bobby to consult his compass.(CONTINUED)111.         *135   CONTINUED:                                                       135He indicates a slight change of direction, and they move
      off again. Still they don't talk. We can feel their
      anxiety breeding in the silence. Why don't they talk?
      They proceed in this weighty silence, but even the CRIES
      of the BIRDS now seem to mock them.

      The route takes them downhill. The slopes are more dense
      with undergrowth now and the going isn't so easy. Some-
      times they are reduced to an undignified scramble, hanging
      onto the bulk of the horse between them. They no longer
      look much like conquerors of the wilderness.136   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                            136They are on the valley floor now. The trees are more
      openly spaced and the grass is richer. They are moving
      quickly but they have a hard time keeping the horse on
      the trot. It hasn't seen grass this good in weeks.137   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                            137They are moving more slowly, the ground is rockier and
      the trees are thickening. They take the easy way up the
      hillside, a natural path made by deer or bear.
      It is difficult to know who is more shaken by their
      encounter, the Indian or Hector and Bobby.
      The INDIAN is sitting behind a tree as they pass, dozing
      or deep in reverie. They almost pass without noticing
      him, but Hector gives a turn of his head and there is the
      Indian four feet from him. At the same instant the Indian
      comes to his senses and sits bolt upright. The encounter
      is high comedy but full of terror for all of them.

      The Indian stands up.       Hector absurdly greets him.HECTORHi!   Hello!
      The Indian backs off from them, holding his hands up and
      smiling crazily, as if to say, "Don't mind me, boys, I'm
      just leaving..." Hector and Bobby are equally silly in
      their response.HECTORHey, come back... we're just
                   moving through... don't
                   apologize... we all got a fright...
                   goodbye...(CONTINUED)112.         *137   CONTINUED:                                                       137The Indian is in full retreat now, waving his hands about
      apologetically, but making good distance from them.
      Suddenly, he is gone. It has happened so quickly that
      Hector and Bobby scarcely believe it has happened. Then
      they realize that in their fright they have let go of the
      horse. It has headed back down to the tastier pastures
      in the valley. They see it disappearing into the trees
      below them.BOBBYThat was stupid...HECTORDid you see him?BOBBYSure I saw him.HECTORWas he a Delaware?BOBBYHow the fuck should I know? He
                   was an Indian... and Indians don't
                   come in ones...HECTORYeah... I think he was an Indian
                   too... What about the horse?BOBBYI'm not going back down there.HECTORDon't panic, Bobby...BOBBYWhy not?
      He runs off into the forest.        Then he turns and shouts to
      Hector.BOBBYCome on!

      Hector follows him, a mad race through the forest.138   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                             138Hector and Bobby are sitting on a rock, gathering their
      wits. It is odd how they talk so matter-of-factly.HECTORWhat did you see?(CONTINUED)113.         *138   CONTINUED:                                                    138BOBBYSame as you.HECTORAn Indian... with long hair...BOBBYThat's it... kind of short...HECTORYeah... he was't tall...BOBBYThat's the one.

      Hector scans the hills above them.HECTORLet's get a bit further up.
      They move off.     Bobby looks at Hector's backpack.BOBBYWhat've you got in there?HECTORSome food, the logbooks, my
                   letters, a candle...BOBBYA gun?HECTORNo.139   EXT. CAMP - DAY                                        139They have stopped to make camp. It is late afternoon,
      the sky just darkening, sharp shadows on the far peaks, a
      purple glow in the air.BOBBYWe won't have a fire tonight. We
                   should make a shelter though, in
                   case it snows.HECTORWhat about bears, without a fire?

      Bobby laughs quietly.BOBBYDon't even think about bears, Hector.114.       *140   EXT. CAMP - NIGHT                                          140They are making a round frame of bent branches and cover-
      ing it with foliage. Half-hidden in the undergrowth, it
      is big enough for two men to huddle in. Tonight they feel
      the most basic of urges, to curl up in a ball and hide.141   INT. CAMP - NIGHT                                          141They are safe and snug in their hideaway. Hector has lit
      his candle. He is reading his letters, holding them close
      to his eyes in the dimness. He has the air of someone
      putting his affairs in order. Bobby is thinking aloud.BOBBYMaybe he's lost too... on his
                own... must be Delaware... they
                were chased up here years ago...
                everybody thought they'd cleared
                off west... the other side of
                Ohio... they were an angry lot...
                no wonder... they used to farm on
                the coast.
      He looks up at Hector, and allows himself a small smile.BOBBYGo on, read it out...
      Hector looks up.HECTORWhat?     No... not tonight...BOBBYI've had to listen to it every
                night since April... why not now?

      Hector gives in. He holds a scrap of paper close to the
      candle and reads.HECTORDear, Father, I miss you. Three
                frogs are dead. Everybody misses

      Bobby doesn't pursue his argument.    He tenses, then

      He puts his head out of the shelter.BOBBYI can't tell... a night like this
                   it could carry for miles...

      He huddles back inside the shelter.BOBBYI wish I had a smoke.(CONTINUED)116.       *141   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              141After a tense silence, Hector takes a small package from
      an inside pocket. He hands it to Bobby.HECTORI was saving it... you have it...

      It is a wedge of tobacco.      Bobby takes it.BOBBYWhat do you mean, you were saving
                   it? You know the rules... no
                   hoarding, tobacco or food... you've
                   listened to me for a month, day and
                   night... wanting a smoke...HECTORWell have it now... I don't smoke...
                   take it...BOBBYYou've kept it from me, and you
                   don't even use it...HECTORI was saving it for my birthday...
                   I was going to give it to you then...BOBBYI have to wait until your birthday
                   for a smoke? Who are you... the

      appears churlish, childish.BOBBYNo... I'll have it in the morning.HECTORCome on... tell me... who would
                   you rather be sitting here with...
                   have a think...

      Bobby does, and then breaks into a smile.BOBBYDaniel Boone?

      Hector smiles, too.HECTORYeah. He would be a help... but
                   after Daniel Boone...BOBBYI can't think of anyone else... but
                   you're impossible to like sometimes.
      Suddenly Bobby grows shy of their growing intimacy.BOBBYWe should sleep. We've got a lot
                   of running to do in the morning.
      But Hector has other plans.          He is in control of their
      friendship now.HECTORNo we're not... we're going to
                   talk... all night...
      Bobby yields to this with the softest, most vulnerable
      smile we have yet seen on his face.HECTORSo... where do you want to start?

      Bobby is silent, but still smiles his acquiescent smile.
      Hector reads the silence well.HECTORI know where you want to start...

      Bobby is still silent.HECTORAlicia...(CONTINUED)118.       *141   CONTINUED:    (4)                                           141Bobby's smile breaks into a boyish laugh.BOBBYWell... what about Alicia?HECTORI'm sorry...BOBBYNo... I'm sorry...HECTORWhat do you mean, you're sorry...
                   I'm the one that has to apologize...

      Bobby is mischievous now.BOBBYOh no you're not...
      It will be a worthwhile night for both of them.142   EXT. FOREST - DAWN                                          142It is a glorious dawn. Bobby sits looking out on the
      valley, smoking his pipe. Behind him Hector is busy
      writing in his log book.BOBBYIsn't it a beautiful day?
      Hector finishes his writing, tears out the page from his
      book. He offers it to Bobby.HECTORI've said who we are and where
                   we're headed. Want to sign it,
                   write anything?BOBBYNo.HECTORThe peak we logged yesterday...

                   Nathaniel's fine...(CONTINUED)119.         *142   CONTINUED:                                                  142Hector smiles. He puts the paper in a small leather
      pouch, puts the pouch on the ground near the shelter,
      and starts to build a small pile of protective stones
      on top of it.
      Bobby stands, and turns to watch him.BOBBYLet's get away from here.HECTORNorth?BOBBYYeah.    Keep the sun on our backs.

      Bobby walks off with great clouds of tobacco smoke
      billowing defiantly around him, as if to challenge
      their night-time tormentor.
      Hector takes a last look at their shelter and its little
      memorial cairn and then runs to catch up with Bobby.143   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                          143Hector and Bobby look vulnerable as they walk through
      the open forest with their meager packs on their backs.BOBBYWe can move quicker without the
                   horse... we just have to keep
                   moving... we have to get away from
                   here.
      Behind them they don't see the figure moving from the
      cover of one tree to another, and then another figure
      following the first. They move like ghosts.144   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                          144Bobby is a few steps ahead of Hector. He dips down
      over a rise, and instantly returns. He throws himself
      and Hector to the ground. Hector tries to struggle free.HECTORWhat's wrong?BOBBYQuiet.   They're on the other side...

      Hector ducks lower, hugging the ground. Bobby is
      already sliding up the slope to look over the rise.
      Hector follows him.(CONTINUED)120.144   CONTINUED:                                                    144On the other side, they see the women and children of
      a small group of Indians at the edge of a stream. The
      women are washing clothes, the children are splashing and
      playing. We are close enough to hear their laughter.BOBBYWe're right in the middle of them...HECTORDoes it have to be bad?   They might
                   be friendly...BOBBYThey were chased here... They should
                   be on the coast growing corn...

      Bobby turns to Hector to make his point. That is when he
      sees the first of the figures, just the ghost of a shadow
      moving from tree to rock. His eyes flick across the
      forest behind them. He sees another figure caught in
      the act of seeking cover, looking absurdly embarrassed
      for the fleeting moment that we see it. Then Bobby
      sees another. Are they teasing them? It looks so much
      like a game children would play.BOBBYOh-oh...                                               *HECTORWhat's wrong?                                          *BOBBYThey're behind us. They must
                   think we're stalking the women...
      Hector looks and sees nothing. Fifty Indians hold their
      breath. The forest seems empty. But Hector looks at
      Bobby. He is grey-faced, a man who is looking at death.
      Hector knows they are doomed.BOBBYDo you want to run?HECTORI'll do what you do.*They leap to their feet and run. There is only one
      way to go, over the rise, through the women and children
      and across the stream. To the watching Indians it looks
      like a direct attack on their families. From behind
      trees and rocks they emerge and begin the chase. A
      tragedy of misunderstanding.(CONTINUED)121.144   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             144Hector and Bobby scatter the women and children and
      splash across the stream, burning all their energy in               *
      this mad life-or-death race. Although their families
      are safe, the Indians keep up the chase, the moment of
      confusion compounded in action. They lope easily after
      them, waiting for the white men to tire. There are no               *
      whoops or shouts. They follow Hector and Bobby into the
      trees, spreading out on either side, shaping the human
      net that will soon engulf them.
      It is a menacing spectacle. Death is near.        Hector
      and Bobby stay close together as they run.BOBBYWhen they catch up... fight...
                   it'll be quicker... fight like
                   hell...HECTORThey're not going to catch us.
                   We're going home.
      Hector stretches out an arm to Bobby.HECTORHold my hand, Bobby...
      They hold hands and run.145   EXT. BUILDING - DAY                                           145A war party of media people surround Hector as he exits
      a Yellow Cab. He forces his way through the yelling
      crowd of REPORTERS and camera crews. Hector is trying
      to make his way into a crumbling apartment building in
      Queens. Policemen help Hector through the barrage of                *

      switch off their energy. They light cigarettes, fiddle              *
      with cameras, stare into space, as if someone has
      shouted "Cut."146   INT. BUILDING - DAY                                         146Hector climbs to the fourth floor.     A POLICEMAN goes with
      him.

      Two paramedics come up the stairs behind them, carrying a
      stretcher. The Policeman stops.POLICEMANYou guys are downstairs... third
                   floor... thirty-eight...
      The paramedics turn around and head back down the stairs.
      Hector looks at the Policeman curiously.POLICEMANYou're forty-eight.

      They continue climbing.147   INT. APARTMENT - DAY                                        147Hector and the Policeman squeeze past a cluster of people

      Hector looks at his watch.HECTOR3:35...MR. SANTIAGOI might have to close the place
                   down.HECTORWhere is she?
      The Detective and Hector walk down the hall. They stop
      at the door of the bathroom. Hector looks inside. There
      is a large ragged hole in the floor. At the far side of
      it the toilet unit dangles at a dangerous angle into the
      hole, held only by its plumbing. Firemen are working to
      secure it and what is left of the floor with metal props
      and hydraulic jacks. Lying on the floor below,
      surrounded by rubble, and being attended by the
      paramedics, is an old lady, MRS. PHILIPPOPOLIS. She
      tries to sit up when she sees Hector peering at her over
      the rim of the hole. She looks angry.MR. PHILIPPOPOLISI phoned you Monday... I told you

      to the hole in the floor. He sees    Mrs. Philippopolis,
      now strapped in a stretcher, being   carried out of the
      room below. At the sight of him,    she tries to sit up,
      straining on her straps.MRS. PHILIPPOPOLISMy son's downstairs... when he

      Then Hector's girl friend ANNA arrives in her car. It is
      a bright pink station wagon, highly decorated with flower
      motifs and slogans like "ANNA'S ARRANGEMENTS," and "FRESH
      OR DRY, WE'LL PLEASE THE EYE." Anna is a florist.
      Hector brightens when he sees her. Everything is falling
      into place. All he has to do now is cross two rivers
      and Manhatan Island in under an hour, in Anna's pink car.

      a Friday afternoon is going to look like a dream sequence
      whatever you do with it, and that's fine.
      Hector's trip to his children has more meaning for us
      than a simple journey from A to B. We will be aware of
      our other Hectors, and the journeys home that they did
      or didn't manage to make. This car trip will pull the
      threads together.
      And after so many images of the natural world, a world
      little altered by man, the PANORAMIC SHOTS of New York in
      all its mad glory will place our Hector in a new dimen-
      sion. If there is a breathtaking moment in this film,
      when everything comes together, when all the pieces fit,
      then it will be somewhere around here that it happens.
      Six thousand years ago we left Hector on a beach, aching
      for his family. If the traffic allows, tonight in New
      Jersey Hector will complete his journey.
      We will GO WITH Hector OVER the bridge, ACROSS the
      avenues of Manhattan and THROUGH the tunnel. His PHONERINGS ONCE.HECTORHello... Leonard, hello... yes...

      On the outskirts of Jersey City he finds the suburban
      street he is looking for. If the last crosslight holds
      on green then he might even make it on time.
      Hector stops the car outside Janet's house and lets out

      Hector nods his head obediently. He always did with
      Janet. The children let their mother pat them and follow
      Hector to his car, eyes to the ground.JANETGood luck, Hector.

      Donald shouts from behind the wheel of his car, where he
      has been hiding.DONALDSee you Monday, Hector.
      The kids load themselves into the back of Hector's car.

      in cellophane and red ribbon. It seems to have grown

      a sigh, and catches sight of the kids in the mirror.
      Their perplexed expressions make them look younger than
      they are, and vulnerable. Hector's heart aches for them.
      He smiles and puts on an act of brightness.HECTORThat's it! The last call... the
                   weekend starts right now... we

      the phone and offers it to them.HECTORWant to make any calls?    Betsy?

      removes three and returns them to the shelf. Hector
      notices and puts up with it for a while. But when Betsy
      returns the rolls of kitchen towel he has selected he
      makes a stand. He turns to face her.HECTORWhat's wrong with that? It's a

      She picks up a more friendly brand of kitchen towel from
      the shelf and throws it into the cart. Hector has the
      sense to back down.HECTORGood point, Betsy...
      Betsy keeps on the attack.BETSYEverything you buy is junk... I

      the Safeway. An attractive woman is filling her car in
      the next line. Her eyes and Hector's meet. For some
      reason they exchange the smallest smile. For a few
      brief moments they are talking without words as their
      tanks fill. The ten billionth romance in the history of
      the planet sparks into life and fizzles out again in the
      twinkling of an eye. By the time their credit cards are
      back in their pockets their love is a memory. From the
      back of the car the kids have watched it all.
      Betsy gives Hector a withering look of disapproval as he
      climbs back into the car.158   INT./EXT. CAR - NIGHT                                      158Back on the road, it is later. The kids have fallen
      asleep. Hector relaxes. He watches them in their sleep,
      searching for some traces of the little children that
      have haunted his thoughts for so many years, the tots
      he abandoned.159   EXT. HOLIDAY HOUSE - NIGHT                                 159The car pulls up at the holiday house. Hector gets out.
      It is dark, but we can hear the sound of the SEA and
      there is sand underfoot. Hector walks to the house and
      unlocks the door. He puts on a couple of exterior lights.
      He carries Thomas, still sleeping, from the car and into
      the house. Betsy follows him, still half-asleep, groaning
      fussily. She talks through her yawns.BETSYAre you going to bring the flowers
                   in?HECTORDon't mention the flowers.140.       *160   INT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                         160Later, Hector can't sleep. It has been too eventful a
      day. He sits bleary-eyed watching a late-night TV SHOW.
      A man sits cross-legged on a studio floor and is talking
      to a phone-in viewer. The TV man has five small stones
      which he regularly scatters on the floor.TV MAN (V.O.)This is good, Tony, the stones

      Perhaps this might have enthralled one of our earlier
      Hectors, but our modern one is simply restless. He
      stands up and leaves the room.161   INT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                         161Next door, he watches the kids sleeping in their little
      holiday beds. Hector watches them. We've seen our
      Hectors do this before, and we feel the echo. But as
      he turns to leave the room Hector gets a fright.(CONTINUED)141.         *161   CONTINUED:                                                      161Betsy starts talking loudly. At first Hector thinks she
      is awake, giving him into trouble, but she is fast asleep.BETSYGet me the books... all the books...
                   all of the books... no, no, no...

      She changes in an instant from a bossy adolescent to a
      tearful, crumpled little girl. She sobs pitifully.BETSY... not the pancakes...

      Hector is a confusion of feelings: frightened,
      fascinated, impotent. How can he help her? How could he
      possibly unravel the secret of the pancakes, what comfort
      could he offer his stranger daughter if he did? It is
      a spooky, mystical moment for Hector, more mystical than
      the mumbo-jumbo still issuing from the TV next door.TV WOMAN (V.O.)... find your true cosmic partner

      Hector moves quietly out of the room, Betsy's sobs having
      subsided. Just as he is closing the door he gets
      another surprise, this time from the sleeping Thomas.THOMAS... don't let the oil run out...
                   yes you did... watch the oil...
                   why... why?
      Hector closes the bedroom door.     He is one spooked, moved
      human being.162   INT. HOUSE - MORNING                                          162In the morning, they are making breakfast in the kitchen.
      The kids are having juice and cereal. Hector is
      scrambling some eggs.HECTORHow about some eggs?
      They shake their heads.(CONTINUED)142.         *162   CONTINUED:                                                 162HECTORYou don't eat eggs?BETSYHow many have you got in there?HECTORThree.   Is that all right?BETSYFor a week, maybe.

      Hector does a little probing.HECTORHow about pancakes, Betsy... d'you

                   mean much to you?BETSYThey don't mean a thing.     Why?HECTORNothing.
      The mystery of Betsy's pancake dream is evidently lost in
      infinity. Hector changes the subject.HECTORI thought we could walk into town

      Hector declines to explain the complex   reasons that he
      might have for not wanting to wear the   shoes of his
      children's replacement father. He sits    down on the            *

      much fun. It is the end of the season. Hector and the                 *

      As the attendant releases the brakes and cranks them up
      into the drizzle, 'round and 'round, Hector knows that he
      has to do something to break the awful distance between
      him and his kids. He looks at them. They sit grimly in
      their rockets, one in front of him and one behind. Their
      faces are set in expressions of what? Boredom?
      Resignation? Patience? Expectancy? Then he realizes
      what is going on. They are waiting for him to open up to
      them, talk to them seriously, explain himself. He looks
      at Betsy's face and sees in it the years of his absence,

      ago.BETSYThomas wanted to visit you in

                   days before your test... it was
                   just what your mother and I
                   decided... I taught you how to

                   why did you leave just then?
      Hector looks at Betsy. She is beginning to cry silently.
      He puts a tentative arm around her shoulder.HECTOROh, God, Betsy. I'm sorry.

      Betsy is still crying.BETSYIt doesn't matter.HECTORHow did you do, in the test?BETSYI passed.
      Hector leaves his limp arm on her shoulder. It is too                *
      soon for gestures of emotion. After a long moment she
      speaks.BETSYI'm a life-saver now.

      Hector doesn't make the obvious comment. His emotions
      are full. He hides his feelings in a gruff call to
      Thomas.HECTORHey, Thomas! We're going home...
                   we're having a barbecue... Betsy

                   like it.BETSYI'm allowed.

                   back to   Anna? I can't face her

      along behind them.BETSYWhat's she like? How did you
                meet her?HECTORThe funny thing is I fell in love
                with her before I ever saw her...
                I smelled her... It was the day I
                got out of jail... I was on the
                train and she was sitting behind
                me... it was just this incredible
                perfume... remember I'd been
                inside for nearly two years with
                four hundred sweating males...
                She got off the train and I

                she listened to a bum who followed
                her off a train...
      Betsy looks at him kindly.HECTOR... but she's still going to kill
                me on Monday...

      They share a laugh.   Betsy looks out to the ocean.BETSYI think I'll paint the sunset
                tonight.HECTORIt's just like a big pancake
                up there, isn't it?
      Betsy doesn't take the bait.   There is a silence.HECTORI remember when you two were tiny..

                   don't have to...HECTORNo?BETSYNo... we can do that...

      She smiles. Hector is out of his depth with this
      daughter of his.HECTORIs that a joke?BETSYNo, I mean it... look out for
                   yourself...
      Hector looks at her in wonderment. One of those moments
      when another human being stands before you and is an
      utter mystery.HECTORWho are you?   Who's inside
                   there?BETSYYou'll never know.
      Future generations of women are going to be just as
      unknowable to our Hectors as past ones were. Betsy
      moves off briskly along the beach. Hector trails
      after her, hooked.169   EXT. BOAT - DAY                                              169Betsy and Thomas are in a small fragile rowboat, some
      distance from the shore. They are watching Hector who
      is collecting a pile of large stones on the beach.
      Another Hector and another pile of stones. This one
      is making a fire for the barbecue. These human rituals
      never stop.BETSYI thought he was taller.(CONTINUED)154.169   CONTINUED:                                                        169THOMASWell, it's been a while... you're
                   bigger.BETSYI suppose so. He's getting fat,
                   too. I bet I could beat him at

      small and vulnerable. Hector is more anxious than he
      should be, out of practice at fatherhood. He calls to
      them.HECTORCome on in, kids... that boat
                   doesn't look too safe...
      They call back to him.BETSYWe're fine!
      Hector tries to relax, but he doesn't have the
      confidence yet, or something. He is edgy.HECTORI've just found you... I don't
                   want to lose you. What would I
                   tell your mother... come on in...

      He walks down to the water. The kids reluctantly pull
      on the oars and bring the little boat in. A few feet
      from the beach they hit some sand. The boat sticks.
      Hector wades out in his shoes so far. Then he calls
      to Thomas.HECTORThrow me the rope, Thomas, I'll
                   pull you in.
      Thomas throws the mooring rope to Hector. It isn't
      attached to the boat. Hector ends up with all of the
      rope in his hands. He stands there, and they all laugh.HECTORThis is one useless piece of
                   rope, Thomas...

      Just for a moment we have the image of our     Hector
      standing on the shoreline with a length of     rope. An
      image with an echo from six thousand years     ago. But
      this time Hector is laughing, and his kids     are safe.155.         *171   EXT. BEACH - SUNSET                                          171At the very moment of sunset Betsy is trying to capture
      it in a watercolor sketch. She has set up an easel on
      the beach. It's like action painting. She works
      frantically on the picture, racing the sun as it dips
      into the ocean. Tough little Betsy can even lose
      patience with the sun.BETSYWhy does it always go so fast...?
      Thomas is laughing at her. He has seen    her attempt this
      before. Hector has other concerns. He     is trying to
      light his barbecue. Match after match    disappears into
      his elaborate stone structure, only to   fizzle out.

      The sun finally vanishes, and Betsy goes limp at her
      easel. The sun has won the race again. She and Thomas
      watch Hector trying to light the fire. After a while
      he is conscious of their amused attention on him, then
      he becomes a little self-conscious.HECTORI used to know how to do this...

      They laugh a little.HECTORI did... I used to be really
                good at this...
      He wafts and blows ineffectually at a flicker of flame.
      There's not much of the caveman about him now.172   EXT. BEACH - DUSK                                            172It is a calm dusk. Hector is turning the meat on the
      barbecue. He is in a splendid frame of mind.HECTORAh... smell it... the smell of
                civilization... scorched meat...
      Hector serves the chicken onto their plates. He sits
      down beside them with his steak, and a glass of wine.
      He watches Thomas attack his chicken, and smiles.HECTORI'd forgotten that... how you
                eat... dedicated... like it's

      Thomas tries it out, eating and humming. It feels good
      to him. His head nods with the chewing and the tune.THOMASHey, so I did... I'd forgotten
                   about that...

      The early stars are appearing in the sky. Hector lifts
      his eyes to a bright point low on the horizon.HECTORThere she is... old Mercury...THOMASNo... Mercury doesn't rise 'til
                   after midnight... that's Jupiter...

      Hector realizes how far his kids have travelled from
      him. He looks at them.HECTORWell, I'm glad you two are thinking
                   about the old planet. I'm proud
                   of you. Look how beautiful

      Hector stands to fetch another baked potato from the fire.
      We see the three of them in a WIDE SHOT, the evening sky
      now pulsing with more and more points of light. Hector's
      voice and laughter carry to us.HECTORDon't worry, you two... I'll tell

      Hector has come to rest, and found peace at last, however
      temporary, here on the beach, beneath the same stars that
      our first Hector wailed at six thousand years ago.
      On Monday he will face the music. The kids will go
      back home, Mrs. Philippopolis will have to be dealt with,
      and the wilting three hundred dollar bouquet of flowers.
      In general, life will take over, on Monday. But at this
