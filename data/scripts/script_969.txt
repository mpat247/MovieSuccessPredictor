          Intercut with STACEY PILGRIM, cute, peppy barista, gabbing on

          looking into the HOT GIRL'S EYES on the back cover album ad.STACEY (CONT'D)So, are you legitimately moving on,
          or is this just you being insane?

          arts version of DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION).
          They punch and kick in unison, side by side.SCOTTDid you know the original name of Pac-
          man was Puck-man? You would think it's
          because Pac-Man looks like a yellow
          hockey puck, but actually it comes
          from the Japanese phrase paku-paku
          which means to flap ones mouth open
          and closed. They changed it over here
          because Puck-Man is too easy to
          vandalize. You know, scratch out the P
          and turn it into an F or whatever?
          Knives flips over Scott's back in a COMBO move.KNIVES CHAUOhmigod, like...wow.SCOTTYeah. Wow.

          know a lot of kids who play piano
          or whatever, but you guys ROCK.SCOTTI knew I personally rocked, but I
          never suspected that we rocked as a
          unit. Thank you, Knives.13 INT. SONIC BOOM (RECORD STORE) - DAY 13Scott and Knives flip through records in perfect sync.KNIVES CHAUI mean, you guys are gonna be HUGE.SCOTTWell, we're already pretty big. But

          to a major label and the singer turned
          into a total bitch and ruined my life.

          knees next to a lonely cactus.SCOTTOh God...so...so alone.
          A MYSTERIOUS GIRL rollerblades across the shifting sands. She
          wears fishnets, an army jacket, skirt and goggles. Her pink
          hair is funky but cool. She is hotter than the desert sun.MYSTERIOUS GIRLYou're not alone. You're just
          having some idiotic dream.SCOTTDoes that mean we can make out?
          But she's gone...17 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - ? 17...SCOTT WAKES UP, sitting up in the FUTON.SCOTTOh God...

          skating towards the desk in SEXALICIOUS SLOW MOTION.KNIVES CHAUDo you know that girl?
          The Rollerblading Girl delivers a package from AMAZON.CA to

          A brief, scrappy ANIMATED FLASHBACK of Young Todd and Ramona.RAMONA (V.O.)I was only dating Lucas until the
          minute Todd walked by. I guess
          that's not very nice, but I used to
          be kind of...like that.
          Young Ramona shoves Young Lucas down a hill and starts making
          out with Young Todd.RAMONA (V.O.)We hated everyone. We wrecked
          stuff. Nobody cared.
          Young Ramona and Young Todd wreck stuff. Nobody cares.RAMONA (V.O.)He punched a hole in the moon for

          Ramona walks on into the night alone, but then-SCOTT (O.S.)Hey... mind if I tag along?(CONTINUED)INTEGRATED FINAL 119B.104 CONTINUED: (4) 104Ramona is flabbergasted to see a cheery Scott walk alongside.RAMONAYou want to come with me?SCOTT(HOPEFUL)I thought maybe we could... try
          again?
          Ramona smiles. She holds out her hand like in the park scene
          earlier. Scott takes it.
          We see the door with the star on it, standing right in the
          middle of the street, snow swirling around it.
          Scott and Ramona walk towards the door, sunrise coming up
          over Toronto, night magically turning to day, winter turning
          to spring.
          Over this magical transformation, we hear a lush rendition of
          '�Ramona' swelling and hear whispers of gossip over Toronto's
          cell phone airwaves.JULIE (V.O.)Oh my God, can I blow your mind?
          Scott Pilgrim totally threw down
          with Gideon Graves at the grand
          opening of Chaos Theater. Yeah, it
          was apparently awesome.STACEY (V.O.)Oh my God, it was a HUGE fight. I
          mean bananas. My little brother
          kicked a guy's head off. Literally.
          It was unbelievable. Someone
          seriously should have been filming
          it.
          Scott and Ramona walk through the door. Tilt up to the
          heavens and reveal the CONTINUE graphic in the stars.CONTINUE? 10...9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1...
