           January 7, 1992FADE INHIBERNATING GROUNDHOGSA family of groundhogs is nestled together in their burrow
          sleeping off the end of a long winter.ROLL CREDITS AND THEME MUSICDISSOLVE TO:EXT. A FOREST CLEARING - EARLY MORNINGThe crust of an old snowfall still covers the frozen ground,
          and the bare, icy branches of the trees glisten dully in the
          early morning light.CUT TO:INT. TV STUDIO - SAME TIMEPHIL CONNORS is standing in front of a blank green wall
          gesticulating animatedly at some invisible images on the wall,
          talking a mile a minute (MOS) . He looks completely crazy as he
          points at nothing and winks to an unseen audience.CUT TO:EXT. WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA - SAME TIMECREDITS CONTINUE as we streak across the winter landscape,
          flying over fields and farms, small towns and hamlets, railroad
          lines and interstates, coalyards and factories, until we cross
          the Allegheny River and follow it to the southwest.CUT TO:INT. TV STUDIO - SAME TIMEPhil continues pointing out features on the blank wall , but
          from a new angle we can see that he ' s looking at a monitor out
          of the corner of his eye which shows the chromakey insert he's
          pointing to -- a national weather map.CUT TO:EXT. NEAR PITTSBURGH - SAME TIMEThe country towns turn to suburbs, traffic on the roads gets
          heavier and finally we see the skyline of Pittsburgh and the
          confluence of the Allegheny with the Monongahela and the Ohio.-2-We zoom into a tall building in the downtown area andDISSOLVE TO:INT. PHIL CONNORS' OFFICE - MORNINGWe don't see anyone at first but the office itself speaks
          volumes about it's inhabitant-- team pictures of the Steelers
          from the Franco Harris-Terry Bradshaw glory years, a framed
          memorial portrait of Roberto Clemente, a local Emmy award
          statue, an erasable weather map and mountains of personal junk
          on the desk, ^windowsill, and every other available surface.
          As the CREDITS END, we notice a sleeping figure on the small
          sofa, buried deep under a pile of coats and a stolen airline
          blanket.
          GIL HAWLEY, Executive Producer of the Action News, sticks his
          head in the door.HAWLEYChrist, what a pit. Phil"
          The sleeping figure rouses himself and looks out at Hawley.
          It's Phil, the .Channel 9 Action News weatherman.PHIL(SLEEPY)What?HAWLEYIt's February first, Phil. You
           know what tomorrow is?
          Phil sits up and.thinks hard. He's in his mid-thirties, smart,
          rugged-looking, perhaps a little too full of himself, but
          clearly a guy with a lot of personality.PHIL(catching on)
           Oh, no! Not again.
          He jumps up and exits the office with Hawley right behind him.PHILForget it! I'm not going.INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUSHawley pursues Phil through the office suite of the Channel 9
          Action News, from the look of it a typical, big city, local
          news operation. A logo on the wall identifies the station as
          WPGH - Pittsburgh.
          Phil ducks into the studio.-3-INT. STUDIO - CONTINUOUSHawley follows him in and catches up with him at the weather
          corner of the Action News set. Phil starts putting weather
          stats up on a chart.PHILGet away from me. I'm working.HAWLEYSo what's the outlook? We gonna
           get that blizzard?
          Phil shakes his head and points to the chart which is headed
          "Phil's Phorecast" with a cute caricature of himself drawn next
          to the title.PHILNo way. All that moisture coming
           up from the Gulf is going to miss
           us completely and take a dump on
           Harrisburg.HAWLEY(with authority)
           Good, 'cause you're going up to
           Punxsutawney to cover the
           groundhog story tomorrow morning
           and I want you back here in time
           to do the five.PHILJesus, Gil, give me a break, will
           you! I covered the goddamn
           groundhog last year and the year
           before that.HAWLEYAnd you'll do it :next year and
           the year after, too. When I
           worked in San Diego, I covered
           the swallows coming back to
           Capistrano for ten years in a
           row.PHILYou should've killed the guy who
           made you do that.HAWLEYI wanted to do it.PHILThen you should've killed
           yourself. I don't want to get
           stuck with the groundhog for the
           rest of my life.-4-HAWLEYIt's a cute story. He comes out,
           he looks around, he wrinkles up
           his little nose, he sniffs around
           a little, he sees his shadow, he
           d oesn't see his shadow-- it's
           nice. People like it.PHILMany people are morons.HAWLEYJust do it.PHILWhat'11 you give me?
          Hawley looks across the studio and sees RITA HANSON enter, a
          very attractive segment producer in her late twenties.HAWLEY(to Phil)
           I'll give you Rita.
           (calls her over)
           Rita, could you come here for a
           second? I got a little job for
           you.
          Rita is relatively new to the station, but very competent,
          personable, humorous, self-assured and very pretty-- in short,
          a genuine princess, though Phil is too self-absorbed at this
          point to realize it.PHIL(TEASING)You can't send Rita out on a
           story like this. She's just a
           cub, a pup, still wet behind the
           ears. Look at her. Her ears are
           sopping wet. This needs a
           Woodward or a Bernstein. It's a
           big story. People need to know.RITA(INTRIGUED)What's the story?HAWLEYThe Punxsutawney Groundhog
           Festival.RITAGil, if it's all right with you
           I ' d rather follow-up on the
           nurses' strike.-5-HAWLEYYou can do the nurses when you
           get back. Just take the squeaky
           wheel here up to Punxsutawney and
           get him back in one piece. Okay?RITAYeah, okay.
          Hawley exits leaving Phil and Rita alone in the studio. She
          knows Phil mainly by his reputation and it isn't good. Still,
          she finds him appealing in an odd way.PHIL(PLEASANTLY)You know, this could be extremely
           interesting.RITAI've never done a weather story
           before. What's Punxsutawney
           like?PHILOh, it's an enchanted place. A
           magical world. It's the
           Constantinople of the whole
           Western Appalachian-Susquehanna
           Drainage system.RITADo you always joke?PHILAbout 70 to 80% of the time.
           Inside I'm actually a very shy
           and sensitive person.RITAA lot of people around here think
           you're not very sincere.PHILTell me the names of these
           people.RITAI'll line up a crew and
           transportation. If you don't
           feel like driving, we can all go
           up in the van together.PHILI think I'll take my own car.
           I ' m not that fond of my fellow
           man.-6-RITA(EXITING)Nice attitude.PHILNice face.
           (calls after her)
           Why don't you ride up with me?RITANo, thanks.
          STEPHANIE DECASTRO , an attractive, dark-eyed, dark-haired
          correspondent, glares at Phil from across the studio.INT. PHIL'S OFFICE - LATERPhil is in his cluttered cubicle talking on a headset phone
          while he reviews cassettes of his groundhog spots from the past
          two years on a small monitor. As he talks, he stuffs a number
          of personal items in an overnight bag, all the time watching
          himself on the TV monitor.PHIL(on the phone)
           They don't really think of me as
           a weatherman around here. More
           of a "personality," but with the
           credibility of a first-class
           broadcast journalist. Once you
           look at my tape I think you'll
           see what they mean.
          Stephanie enters and stands in the doorway looking at Phil for
          a long moment. There is something vaguely off-center about
          this woman, not quite FATAL ATTRACTION but still a little
          scary.STEPHANIE(BITTERLY)I just want to know one thing:
           did I do something wrong or are
           you just tired of me or what? I
           have to know.
          Phil sighs.PHIL(on the phone)
           Dan, can I call you back? I've
           just been handed something and I
           better get on it...
           (he picks up some
           papers and rustles
           them for effect)
           ...Okay, thanks.-7-He takes off the headset, gets up and closes the door for
          privacy.PHIL(KINDLY)You didn't do anything wrong,
           Stephanie, and I ' m not tired of
           you. It's just that I don't have
           time for a real relationship
           right now. I told you that the
           first time we went out.STEPHANIE(getting close)
           Everybody says that at the
           beginning of a relationship.PHIL(gently pushing herAWAY)I'm different. I really meant
           it! Things are really starting
           to move for me now. I ' m not
           going to be doing the weather for
           the rest of my life. I was just
           talking to the CBS guy about a
           network job. I want that. This
           is just the beginning for me. I
           can't waste any more time.STEPHANIEAre you saying our relationship
           was a waste of time?PHILOur relationship? We went out a
           total of four times! And only
           twice did anything happen. It
           was fun but I don't see that as
           a big commitment.STEPHANIE(closing in again)
           I had our charts done. My
           astrologer says we're extremely
           compatible. There may even be
           some past lives involvement here.PHILSee? So we've already done this.
           Let's move on. Next case.STEPHANIEYou know what's wrong with you,
           Phil? You're selfish. You don't
           have time for anyone but
           yourself.-8-PHILThat's what I ' m trying to tell
           you. You don't want to be with
           me. You can do better. Look,
           Stephanie, if I ever said or did
           anything to mislead you I'm sorry
           for that, but right now I have to
           do this groundhog thing and I
           don't have a handle on it yet.
          He throws some papers and his datebook into a briefcase and
          puts on his jacket.PHIL (CONT.)I'll tell you what. I ' m going to
           do some serious thinking while
           I ' m in Punxsutawney, okay?
          He pats her on the shoulder and brushes past her, leaving her
          standing there with a malevolent look on her face.CUT TO:EXT. A HIGHWAY - AFTERNOONA VAN marked ".Channel 9 Action News" speeds along a two-lane
          highway through the winter landscape of West Central
          Pennsylvania. Mounted atop the van is a microwave transmitter.
          Rita is riding up front with LARRY, the union cameraman and
          techie. Phil is following close behind the van in a new Lexus
          coupe. His car has a bumper-sticker that reads "Weathermen
          Like it Wet."PHIL (V.O.)(on his earphone)
           I'm on my way to Punxsutawney...
           (forced to repeat it,
           a little embarrassed)
           Punx^su-taw-ney....Work or fun?
           I think that all depends on you.INT. THE LEXUS - CONTINUOUSPhil is talking to one of his girlfriends, sorting through a
          stack of CD's, as usual, grabbing at the good life with both
          hands.PHIL. . . . I thought maybe you could
           meet me up there tonight and let
           me vulgarize you for about seven
           hours....So I ' m supposed to spend
           the night in Punxsutawney all
           alo ne? Thanks.Phil loads a CD and a great, driving song kicks in.CUT TO:A SIGN"Welcome to Punxsutawney - The Original Weather Capitol of the
          World Since 1887." Depicted on the sign is a large cartoon
          GROUNDHOG wearing a top hat and clutching an umbrella under his
          arm.
          The mini-convoy passes some fast food places on the outskirts
          of town.EXT. MAIN STREET - PUNXSUTAWNEY - LATERThe van drives along , the small-town main drag. There are
          cartoon groundhogs everywhere you look and the whole town has
          been gaily festooned with banners and bunting.EXT . MOTEL - LATERThe van pulls into the parking lot at a Quality Inn. The
          announcement billboard in ;front of the motel reads: "Groundhog
          Day Breakfast Special - Feb.2 - All You Can Eat - $5.99." The
          parking area is already crowded with cars including a number of
          other news vans. The Lexus pulls in behind the van and
          everybody gets out.
          Phil takes one look at the motel and shakes his head.PHIL(calls out)
           Rita! I can't stay here.
          Rita is already helping Larry unload equipment from the van.LARRY(MUTTERING)Prima donnas.RITAIt's okay. I'll handle it.
          She crosses to the Lexus where Phil is trying to make another
          call on his earphone.RITAWhat's the problem, Phil?PHILI hate this place. I stayed here
           two years ago and I was
           miserable. It's like a minimum
           security prison. I'm not staying
           here.-10-RITAYou're not staying here.PHIL(BRIGHTENING)I ' m not?RITANo, Larry and I don't care but I
           thought you might, so I booked
           you at a very nice bed and
           breakfast on Cherry Street.
           Here's the address.
          She hands him a card.PHIL(PLEASED)Great. That's great. That's the
           mark of a really good producer.
           Making the talent happy.RITAWhatever I can do.PHILReally? Will you be my love
           slave?RITAWhatever I can do within reason.
           Would you like to have dinner
           with Larry and me?PHILNo thanks, I've seen Larry eat.
           Why don't you ditch Larry and let
           me take you someplace nice?RITAYou mean like a date?PHILYeah.RITAOh, no.PHILOkay. I get it. You're a little
           intimidated by me, you're all
           excited about the shoot tomorrow,
           you want everything to go just
           perfect. I understand. You just
           get some sleep. Tomorrow will be
           great.-11-RITAWell, that's something to look
           forward to. I'll see you in the
           morning.
          He drives off, leaving her standing there shaking her head.LARRYDid he actually call himself "the
           talent?"
          Larry snorts and continues unloading their gear.CUT TO:EXT. CHERRY STREET - DAWNThe first light of morning colors the sky behind the Cherry
          Street Inn, a rambling, white Victorian bed and breakfast.CLOSE UP - CLOCKA digital clock-radio changes from 5:59 to 6:00 AM. The radio
          comes on, playing the end of the Sonny and Cher hit, "I Got
          You, Babe."SUPER: FEBRUARY 2INT. PHIL'S ROOM - DAWNPhil sits up in bed and looks around the room. The decor is
          typical bed and breakfast, flocked wallpaper, framed prints,
          and an odd assortment of mismatched furniture. His suit is
          hanging neatly on the back of the closet door and his suitcase
          is open on a stand at the foot of the bed, still neatly packed.

          The deejay laughs. Phil shakes his head at the cheesy repartee
          as he crosses to the sink and starts brushing his teeth.-12-DEEJAYNot hardly. And you can expect
           hazardous travel later today with

          One wall is lined with .bookcases filled with books. A handful
          of guests are seated around the room, eating.
          The matron of the house, MRS. LANCASTER, spots Phil as she

           overcast, high today in the low
           30's, dropping to the low 20's
           tonight, but I'm predicting that
           all that moisture coming up from
           the Gulf is going to miss us and
           dump some locally heavy snow,
           possibly blizzard conditions with
           travel advisories in the
           Harrisburg area and maybe as far
           east as .Philadelphia.

          and gloves as he descends the front steps of the house and
          joins the flow of pedestrian traffic on the street.EXT. MAIN STREET -KPUNXSUTAWNEY - CONTINUOUSThere are a lot of people on the street for this hour. Traffic
          is so heavy in fact, the pedestrians are moving faster than the
          cars. Everyone seems to be going in the same direction, making
          the annual trek to see the groundhog.
          An OLD BUM is sitting on the sidewalk leaning against a
          storefront. Someone throws him a coin. Phil walks by without
          taking any notice.MAN (O.C.)Hey, Phil!-15-A big pie-faced man, NED RYERSON, comes huffing and puffing

          dirt enclosed by a rail fence, waiting for the big moment. For
          a cold gray dawn, there is the atmosphere of a festival here.
          An area close to the mound is roped off for news reporters and
          cameras. Rita stands there, a pocket of genuine beauty in this
          sea of potbellied old union guys and blow-dried reporters.-17-Stomping her feet against the cold, Rita looks at her watch and

          The groundhog sticks his head out, looks around, steps out of
          the hole, and runs over to the other side of the mound, about
          as far away from the cameras as he can get.PHILHey! Over here, you little

          squeak and runs back into the hole.PHILGreat shot, huh, folks? Well,

          Phil points to the hole and Larry zooms in.
          The groundhog sticks his head out, looks left, looks right,
          steps out of the hole, and runs away from the press pool,
          directly over to Larry's camera. As he stands there, his body
          casts a long shadow. The groundhog looks right into the
          camera, lets out a squeak, and runs back into the hole.
          Rita and Larry are completely amazed as the crowd cheers the
          brief appearance of the groundhog. Larry pans back to Phil.

          sink.
          Phil stands there, staring at his image in the mirror, trying
          to figure out what's happening to him. He starts breathing
          heavier, as if gathering courage, then, just when we think he's
          going to cut off his ear or something, he raises an electric
          barber clipper and shaves a bald stripe up the middle of his
          head. He studies his new look for a moment then smashes the
          mirror with his sledgehammer.
          Then he opens the cans of paint, dips the two big brushes into
          the cans and starts slapping bright red paint onto the walls,
          madly, feverishly, splashing himself and everything else in the
          room with it.

          then shakes them all around the room creating a storm of
          feathers.
          Finally, Phil falls exhausted on the bed. From outside we can
          hear outraged hotel employees pounding on the door.
          We pan over to the clock radio, the only undamaged object in
          the room. Feathers drift down past the face of the clock which
          reads 5:59 AM. The time changes to 6:00, the radio clicks on
          and "I Got You, Babe" starts playing as we pan back to Phil
          sleeping on the bed.

          paint, no feathers, no damage. Everything is as clean and tidy
          as the day he checked in.
          He races over to the unbroken mirror and looks at himself. His
          hair is completely restored, as if it had never been shaved.

          can't believe it. He charges the glass and pounds it with the
          rifle butt. He can't even chip it. Suddenly he is seized from
          behind by TWO STRONG MEN who take the rifle from him and
          wrestle him to floor.

          madness.
          Suddenly, Phil whips out a big kitchen knife from under his
          icoat and dives at the groundhog. Town officials and police
          throw themselves on Phil as the groundhog scampers safely back
          into his hole.

           with you.PHILOkay, I wake up in Punxsutawney
           on February second -- every day.
           It's supernatural. I don't even
           try to explain it anymore. So,
           I live each day as if it's the
           only day I've got.
          Rita stares into his eyes for a very long time, but sees only
          good, true things.RITAThat's pretty amazing. "-115-PHILYou want to know what's really
           amazing? I've been waiting for
           you every day for ten thousand
           years. I dream of you every
           night of my life. You've been my
           constant weapon against total
           despair, and just knowing you
           exist has kept me alive. How's
           that?
          Rita can't even speak. This is clearly the nicest thing
          anybody has ever said to anybody.
          Mary the piano teacher notices Phil.MARYPhil!
           (to her friend)
           This is the guy.PHILHello, Mary. Rita, this is one
           of Punxsey's finest musicians.�MARYGive me a break. You should
           talk. Why don't you play
           something?PHILN o , I--MARYPlease.FREDHey, Mr. Connors. Go for it.
          Phil looks at Rita. She nods and shrugs.
          Phil walks up to the platform and sits at the piano. He begins
          to play a slow, serious, classical piece. Everyone falls
          silent. It's so beautiful, Rita is almost in tears.
          Then, after a pause to let the serious notes sink in, Phil
          transforms the piece into a fast, lively, upbeat jazz romp.
          Everyone is delighted, and as the rest of the band kicks in,
          everyone grabs a partner and begins to dance.
          An old coot, UNCLE LEO, grabs Rita and the two of them dance up
          a storm.LEOThat's a great guy you've got
           there. Doctor Connors fixed my
           back, you know.- -116-RITADo ctor Connors?Rit a looks over at Phil, joyously playing the piano.CUT TO:EXT . STREET - NIGHTIt is snowing lightly. Phil and Rita are walking slowly, arm
          in arm, close. They stop and embrace. Phil looks at Rita.
          She looks like an angel.PHILWait! Don't move!Phil scoops up some snow and begins packing it down, furiously,
          joyously, then rolling it into a large ball.RITAMaking a snow man? I'll help.PHILNo, stay there. Stand right
           th ere.Ph il lifts the now larger chunk of packed snow and sets it on
          a mailbox. Then he looks at her, and starts to sculpt it.DISSOLVE TO:LATERPhil is using a stick and the heat of his bare hands to model
          a delicate fold in the snow sculpture. Several bystanders look
          o n with interest as Phil stands back from his work.RITACan I look?PHILO kay, look.It is an excellent likeness of Rita, the snow white as
          alabaster, pure as marble, a beautiful and delicate homage.RITA(OVERWHELMED)Nobody's ever done this for me.
           Not even a drawing. It's
           beautiful.-117-PHILThis is how I see you. When it
           all gets too much, I just close
           my eyes and there you are-- just
           like this. Take it home and keep
           it in the freezer.
          Rita embraces Phil. They are about to kiss, looking deep into
          each others eyes.PHILThis one's for the Frog Prince.RITAWhat?PHILNothing.
          They kiss-- a long, deep, soul-stirring kiss.PHILWill you come with me?
          Rita nods. They continue standing there, embracing, warming
          each other in the cold night air.RITA(looks back at the iceSCULPTURE)We're just going to leave her?PHILIt doesn't matter. Really, it
           doesn't.
          They kiss again.CUT TO:CLOSE UP - THE CLOCKThe digital clock-radio changes from 5:59 to 6:00. Silence.
          No Sonny and Cher, no deejays-- nothing.
          Phil sits up in bed. He looks around the room. Things are
          different, messier. Then he sees the covers move. Wide-eyed
          now, he looks over and sees Rita waking up, snuggling deep
          under the covers.PHIL(DISBELIEVING)It's not true. It's not. It
           can't be true. Rita? Rita!-118-RITA(STRETCHINGLUXURIOUSLY)Mmmm. Morning.
          Phil pounces on Rita, showering her with kisses.PHILYou're here! My god! I can't
           believe you're here!RITAGlad to see you, too.PHILNo! It's happened. Don't you
           get it? It's tomorrow! It's --
          Phil turns on the radio.DEEJAY. . . still shoveling put the
           highways, but if you're walking,
           it's a beautiful day.S IDEKICKYeah, the snow kind of cleaned
           e ve r yt h in g up--DEEJAY--except your mouth.
          Phil kisses the radio.PHILI love those guys.RITAAre you always this jolly in the
           morning?
          Phil runs to the window and looks out.HIS POV - THE STREETThe street ;is virtually empty, the town just waking up. Kids
          are throwing snowballs.PHILNo groundhog! Rita! They're all
           gone!RITAYou must've had some dream.
          Phil stops, thinks.-1 1 9 -PHILDid I just dream it?
          Phil opens the door and runs into the hallway wearing only
          pajama bottoms.RITAPhi l? Phil!
          Rita sits up in bed and waits. Suddenly, from somewhere else
          in the inn comes the sound of Phil at the piano expertly
          playing a difficult classical piece. He stops after a few
          bars.PHIL (O.C.)Yeah!!!!
          Phil runs back into the room.PHILIt really happened! You're
           really here!
          He pounces on Rita again.PHILYou're really actually here.RITA(LAUGHING)I'm here, I'm here!
          They kiss, passionately, hungrily.PHILLet's go!
          He scoops her up in his arms.RITAWhere're we going?PHILAnywhere! Everywhere!CUT TO:INT. BREAKFAST ROOM - LATERPhil and Rita, dressed now, enter and encounter Mrs. Lancaster
          Phil hugs her.MRS. LANCASTEROh, my!-120-PHILFlorence! Say hello to Rita.
           She loves me.MRS. LANCASTERI'm not surprised.
          He kisses her on the cheek and rushes out with Rita.EXT. THE STREET - DAYPhil and Rita walk down Main Street hand in hand.A MANPhil! Good morning!A LADYMr. Connors. I wanted to thank
           you.PHILThat's all right. I--
          A FLORIST steps out of the flower shop with a bouquet.FLORISTPhil, here. I want you to have
           these.PHILThanks, Carl.
          Phil smells the flowers, and hands the bouquet to Rita.PHIL (V.O.)And so began my final lifetime,
           and ended the longest winter on
           record. I would find myself no
           longer able to affect the chain
           of events in this town, but I did
           learn something about time. You
           can waste time, you can kill
           time, you can do time, but if you
           use it wisely, there's never
           enough of it. So you'd better
           make the most of the time you've
           got.
          A car skids on the ice and smashes into a tree. Phil and Rita
          rush over to help, but the driver waves that he's okay. Rita
          and Phil continue their walk.-121-PHIL (V.O.)Larry never got through the
           blizzard, so none of my groundhog
           reports ever made it on the air.
           But Rita and I-- we lived happily
           ever after.
          Phil and Rita walk off together.
          Across the street, Larry is trying to get rid of Ned Ryerson
          who is doggedly trying to sell him insurance.NEDBut Phil told me you were his
           accountant!LARRYLook, I told you! He's nuts!
          Larry keeps trying to walk away, but Ned won't leave him alone.NEDLet me just tell you about single
           premium life--
          Finally, Larry slugs Ned and storms off, leaving Ned
          floundering in a snowbank.
          Phil and Rita walk on as we pull up and away from Main Street
          revealing the whole of Punxsutawney and the snowy countryside
          that embraces it.THE END
