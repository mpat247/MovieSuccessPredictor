    full. The JUDGE a stern, old hand. The PROSECUTOR, an

    witness in a criminal trial. Her testimony has been
    carefully rehearsed.BARBARA... we go back to our homeroom for
               dismissal, unless you have a pass
               for sports or something.PROSECUTOR (O.S.)And is that what you did on the

               chair beside his desk.

    MR. GETTYS, the defendant, is 50. The very picture of
    respectability. His perfect wife and son staunchly
    enduring this testimony.(CONTINUED)2.1   CONTINUED:                                                      1PROSECUTORIn your own words, Barbara, can
                 you tell us exactly what happened
                 during the next few minutes?

    KEVIN LOMAX.    Defense counsel.   Taking it all in.BARBARA (O.S.)I told him I was afraid I would
                 miss my bus. He promised I would
                 get to the bus on time if I would
                 help him to do something...

    Kevin -- his eyes -- drifting around the courtroom --
    taking inventory -- assessing damage --BARBARA (O.S.)... Then he put -- before I could
                 say anything -- he placed his hand
                 inside my blouse...

    Kevin -- checking the jury and --BARBARA (O.S.)... I was so frightened I didn't
                 move. I thought if I was just
                 quiet it would be okay...

    Kevin -- checking Gettys -- seeing something that stops
    him cold --BARBARA (O.S.)... Then his other hand went up
                 under -- inside my skirt...

    Gettys' hand -- down below the table -- down where no one
    but Kevin could possibly see it -- Getty's fingers subtly
    feeling their way along the leg of his chair --BARBARA (O.S.)... his hand then, it started, he
                 started, moving back and forth --
                 farther and farther inside my
                 skirt...

    Kevin -- glancing around -- nobody else can see it --BARBARA (O.S.)... he said he was testing to see
                 if I had any special feelings,
                 that he wanted to find out what
                 kind of feelings I had...(CONTINUED)3.1   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               1Gettys' hand -- excited now -- stroking the chair leg --
    absently -- involuntarily -- unmistakably sexual --BARBARA (O.S.)... I didn't know what to say, I
                 was trying to think of something
                 to say but I was confused and he
                 just kept on -- with his hand --
                 moving it -- under my dress --
                 higher and higher...

    Kevin is rocked.    Trying not to show it.BARBARA (O.S.)... then I, I was asking him to
                 stop but it was like he couldn't
                 hear me -- he just kept on --

    Suddenly, Gettys' hand stops moving --BARBARA (O.S.)-- and then I screamed...

    Kevin looks up to find Gettys' eyes waiting for him.
    Gettys quickly returns his hand into his lap. He's been
    caught -- watching, as Kevin turns away and --BARBARA... then he, he got mad and said
                 we would have to try again
                 sometime.PROSECUTORAnd did he try again?BARBARANot with me.PROSECUTORWith friends of yours?BARBARAYes.PROSECUTORAnd when you told them what he had

      We're back in Florida. Where we started. Kevin touches
