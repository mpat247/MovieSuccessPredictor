          Clarinet Concerto in A.FADE UPEXT. THE SOLAR SYSTEMSpace, infinite and empty.But then, slowly all nine planets of our Solar System move
          into frame and align.The last of them is the giant, burning sphere of the sun.Just as the sun enters frame, a solar storm of gigantic
          proportion unfolds. The eruptions shoot thousands of miles
          into the blackness of space.FADE TO BLACK2009FADE UPEXT. COUNTRY SIDE/INDIA - SUNSETMozart's concerto filters from a jeep's stereo, fighting the
          drumming sounds of the monsoon rain. PROF. FREDERIC WEST, 66,
          listens to the music.An Indian BOY playing by the roadside steers his wooden toy
          ship across a puddle.The Professor turns to his driver, pointing to the boy.PROF. WESTWatch out!But it's too late. The jeep drives straight through the
          puddle at full speed, sinking the boy's toy ship.In the background, the jeep stops in front of a building. The
          driver jumps out, leading the Professor towards its entrance.The sign at the door reads: `Institute for Astrophysics -
          University of New Delhi'.2.INT. NAGA-DENG MINE/INDIA - SUNSETAn endless mine shaft. An old elevator cage comes to a
          grinding halt. When Prof. West steps out we see that he is
          accompanied now by a nervous DR. SATNAM TSURUTANI, 32.PROF. WESTHow deep are we?SATNAM8200 feet. Used to be an old copper
                    mine, Professor, sir.As Prof. West follows Satnam, he takes in the unusual setting
          for this science lab.PROF. WESTHelmsley told me that the neutrino
                    count doubled during the last sun
                    eruptions.SATNAMCorrect, sir. But that is not what
                    worries me...They enter a large room with low hanging ceilings. A small
          group of WHITE COATS look up from their computers, which all
          show images of the solar storm we witnessed earlier.SATNAM (CONT'D)There was a new solar storm, so strong
                    that the physical reaction got even
                    more severe.PROF. WESTHow can that be?SATNAMWe don't know, Professor, sir.Satnam walks over into another room. There he opens a hatch
          on the floor and hot steam rises.SATNAM (CONT'D)The neutrinos suddenly act like...
                    microwaves.Prof. West slowly steps closer. When he discovers that the
          water in the tank below is boiling, his face goes pale.CUT TO:3.EXT. LARGE TERRACE/WASHINGTON D.C. - EVENINGA major fund raising party is under way. The setting is
          spectacular. A terrace overlooking the Washington Mall and

          AIDES. He is the only African-American among them.One of the aides spots CARL ANHEUSER, 58, White House Chief
          of Staff, working the crowd.POLITICAL AID #1Look at Anheuser. Anyone would think he
                    was President. Did you hear, he wants
                    us to sign in and out like school boys?ADRIANI still can't believe that Wilson chose
                    him of all people to run the White
                    House.POLITICAL AID #2Why not? Anheuser owns the Senate and
                    the Congress.ADRIANShame he's such a pompous ass.ANHEUSER (O.S.)Somebody mention my name?Adrian turns to see Anheuser smiling.ADRIAN(SHOCKED)Yes sir... No, sir.ANHEUSERWhich one is it?ADRIANWe were talking about what a great

          Satnam's family around the dining room table.PROF. WESTListen, Adrian. The situation is much
                    worse than we thought...Satnam quiets his little son. It is the boy we saw earlier
          with his toy ship.INT. HALLWAY/WHITE HOUSE - DAYAdrian follows Anheuser through a hallway of the White House,
          papers in hand.ADRIANSir, the President needs to know this.ANHEUSERHelmsley, how long have you been on the
                    job as science advisor?ADRIANFour months this week.ANHEUSERI would   say that's enough time to learn
                    that we   have rules here. You'll just
                    have to   wait until the quarterly
                    science   briefing.ADRIANIf this is about what I said last
                    night, I am truly sorry, sir.ANHEUSERSo you didn't like my speech?Exasperated, Adrian holds out the papers to him.ADRIANCan you please have a look at this,
                    sir? It's really important.(CONTINUED)5.Finally, Anheuser rips the papers out of his hands and starts
          to walk away, reading.Suddenly he slows down.ANHEUSERWho wrote this?ADRIANAn Indian astrophysicist I graduated
                    with from Harvard and Prof. West, the
                    preeminent geologist in the US.ANHEUSERWho else knows about it?ADRIANNo one, sir.ANHEUSERLet's keep it that way, Helmsley.Anheuser walks away.FADE TO BLACK2010FADE UPEXT. SEVILLE/SPAIN - DAYG8 Summit. Riot police control the unruly crowd with water

                    absolutely fine, for what I have to
