        They spot Exley lying there.  Hushed whispers as they
        approach:  "Dead meat."  "Be careful."  Kicks in the
        side.  The men look at each other, sneer.

        Exley jerks a foot.  The foot man stumbles as Exley spins
        around SHOOTING.  FIRING the .45 and his own .38.  All
        four men go down.  Exley stands, digs into his pocket to
        reload.

        and smiles as Bud reloads the shotgun.  It's dead quiet.EXLEYI'm thinking we might walk away
                  from this.

        At that instant, Dudley steps through the bathroom door.
        He's got Exley dead to rights.  As he squeezes the
        trigger, Bud leaps forward, pushes Exley hard to the
        ground.

        The SHOT passes through Bud's back by his left shoulder
        blade.  It spins him around.  A SECOND SHOT to the
        stomach slows him to a walk as he charges Dudley.  A
        THIRD ROUND SHATTERS Bud's jaw, but still he comes.
        Driven by rage, his hands reaching for Dudley's throat.
