GRAND THEFT PARSONSWritten byJeremy DrysdaleJune 2003OPENING TITLE."ALTHOUGH THIS MOTION PICTURE IS INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY,CERTAIN CHARACTERS AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL."FADE IN:SUPER: 'SEPTEMBER 1973'.INT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHTA phone rings in the dark. A little light falls from the
          open window, illuminating an old bakelite telephone. It
          sits on a small table alongside a large amount of empty
          bottles and a couple of overflowing ashtrays.EXT. PHIL'S TRIKE. NIGHTA three wheeled motorcycle is being driven through the
          night at great speed. The trike is moving very quickly,
          its headlights cutting through the darkness, its wheels
          sending a spray of sand flying towards us, as the driver
          fights to keep it on the road. This is PHIL KAUFMAN, and
          he's in a hurry.INT. JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHTTwo figures are struggling on the floor. The male is
          naked. The woman sits astride him, her movements urgent,
          her breath fast. They appear to be having sex.EXT. TRIKE. DAWNThe Trike cuts through the night, and we pull back to show
          desert, more desert, and then... a giant bright, flickering
          neon sign: 'Welcome to the Joshua Tree Inn'.INT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHTThat phone - still ringing; shrill, insistent. There is a
          bed next to the table. It is covered in clothes, but there
          is also a man's shape, which now moves.INT. JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHTA little more light, and it now appears as if our man and
          woman are struggling. There is fear on her face.INT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHTStill that insistent ringing, and the covers suddenly fly
          off the bed. We see the man from behind as he shakes the
          sleep away and looks for the damn phone.2.INT. JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHTThe woman is screaming now, and banging on the man's chest
          with her fists. He is motionless underneath her.EXT. OUTSIDE JOSHUA TREE INN. DAWNThe Trike skids to a halt amid a cloud of dust and the
          driver leaps off. He runs at the door, throwing it open in
          one movement, disappearing into the room. A broken striped
          'No Entry - Police' band flutters to the ground.INT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHTThe man finally answers the phone.   At last the ringing
          stops.PHILHello?EXT. OUTSIDE JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHTThe door bounces back open, and we can see the Phil walking
          quickly through the room.As he searches, we hear:WOMAN'S VOICEOh my God please help me! I
                    found your number in his pocket
                    and I don't know... I don't know
                    what to do.PHIL'S VOICEAh, what... who are you?WOMAN'S VOICEHe's dead... he's dead... and
                    I'm... just... I don't know what
                    to do.The man glances into the bathroom and opens some drawers.PHIL'S VOICEHold on.   Tell me who's dead.WOMAN'S VOICEParsons. Gram Parsons. We met
                    in a bar and we had a lot to
                    drink and he just...PHIL'S VOICEAre you sure he's dead?He looks under the beds.3.CON TINUE D:WOMAN'S VOICEYeah. He's really dead.    He
                         just...PHIL'S VOICEListen. Call an ambulance.

                         of there. Okay? Okay?WOMAN'S VOICEYeah, okay. I'm goin'...He picks up a sheet of paper from the bedside table and
          glances at it. He turns and walks past us to the car and
          for the first time we see Phil Kaufman's face.EXT. JOSHUA TREE HOSPITAL. MORNINGThe Trike skids to a halt outside the small white hospital.
          There are a couple of press vehicles parked outside, and a
          reporter is recording a piece to camera in the background.
          Phil sits for a moment, and then opens the door and walks
          to the entrance.INT. JOSHUA TREE HOSPITAL. MORNING - MOMENTS LATERWe move through the reception area up to the nurses'
          station. Phil is in conversation with a large woman in a
          nurse's uniform.NURSEYou wanna run that by me again,
                         sir?PHILOkay. I'd like to see Gram
                         Parsons.They stare at each other.4.CON TINUE D:NURSEYou want to see Gram Parsons?PHILYes. Alone, if possible. And
                         would you have a gurney standing
                         by in case I need to move him?She looks carefully at the pyjamas which peek out from
          under the shabby overcoat. His hair is on end. He is
          wearing biker boots and is holding an unlit but half-smoked
          cigar.NURSEAnd you are.... his physician?
                         Or perhaps a close relative?
          Phil clears his throat.PHILActually, I'm his road manager.The big nurse smiles mirthlessly.NURSESo you're not his physician or a
                         close relative?A beat.PHILNo.NURSEMister Parsons is awaiting a post
                         mortem. He will then be
                         delivered to his family. I
                         suggest you speak to them if you
                         wish to pick through his personal
                         effects. Sir.She turns away.PHILNow listen here...NURSENo, you listen here. Mister
                         Parsons is dead and no longer
                         appears to need a road manager.
                         Which makes two of us.The nurse turns and marches down the corridor. Phil waits
          until she's gone and then walks through a door marked
          'Admittance only to Authorized Hospital Staff'.5.INT. HOSPITAL LOCKER ROOM. MORNINGPhil slips off his overcoat and stuffs it into the trash.
          He tosses away the unlit cigar, grabs a white coat from a
          hook and puts it on. He walks out through another door.INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. MORNINGPhil wanders down the corridor, glancing into rooms and
          checking signs. He pushes open a door marked 'Pathology'.INT. HOSPITAL PATHOLOGY LAB. MORNINGThe room is empty, except for a couple of covered bodies on
          trolleys. Phil checks under the first sheet, and recoils
          at whatever it is which lies beneath.PHILSheesh!He walks over to the next gurney and lifts the sheet.   He
          stares down at the body, visibly moved.PHIL (CONT'D)Hello buddy. How you been?He stands for a moment, gripping the gurney and looking
          down at his friend. Then he snaps out of it.PHIL (CONT'D)Well, I can't stand around here
                    chatting with you all day.
                    Things to do...He wheels the gurney towards the door.INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. MORNINGPhil wheels the gurney down the corridor towards the exit.
          A doctor in green scrubs approaches and glances down at a
          clipboard.DOCTORCan I help you?PHILNaw, I'm cool thanks.The doctor reads the tag on the body's toe.DOCTORWhat are you doing?PHILJust taking some stiff down to
                    neurology.6.CON TINUE D:DOCTORWe don't have a neurology
                         department.PHILUrology.The doctor grabs the end of the gurney. Phil tugs and the
          doctor tugs back. After a moment, Phil sighs and shakes
          his head in frustration.PHIL (CONT'D)Okay. Just hold your horses -
                         I'll go check the paperwork.The doctor holds up his clipboard.DOCTORI have the paperwork.PHILNo. You have your paperwork. I
                         need to go check my paperwork.He slips through the exit. The doctor waits awkwardly     for
          a few seconds, and then pushes open the door.DOCTORHello?   Hello...He glances around in surprise, but there is no-one in
          sight.EXT. DESERT. MORNINGPhil's trike accelerates as it approaches a T junction.      To
          the right the sign points to 'Joshua Tree Town', to the
          left 'Los Angeles'. The trike doesn't even slow as it
          skids left, sending a spray of sand and gravel flying
          across the road.NB. There will be several shots of Phil driving through
          the desert, set to music.EXT. PHIL'S STREET. DAYThe Trike pulls up outside a rambling old house. Two
          enormous plaster eagles flank the front door, a giant
          Harley Davidson sign hangs from the roof, and there's a six
          foot flashing neon star in the front window. Phil gets
          out, walks up to the door and pulls some keys out of his
          pocket.7.INT. PHIL'S SITTING ROOM. DAYPhil walks into the room and pours himself a drink. He
          slumps onto the couch, takes a sip and closes his eyes. We
          see movement behind him, as an attractive girl slips
          through a door and approaches Phil from behind. This is
          SUSIE, and she puts her hands over his eyes.SUSIEGuess who?PHILMartin Luther King.SUSIETry again...
          Susie leans over the back of the chair and gives Phil a
          long slow kiss. She jumps over the couch and resumes
          kissing, this time more passionately. Phil tries to pull
          away with little success.PHILThis.... ...isn't.... ...the
                    best time... ...Baby....Susie continues regardless, Phil is now finding it hard to
          resist. He eventually gives in, and they begin to kiss
          passionately.INT. PHIL'S KITCHEN. DAYPhil and Susie are sitting at the kitchen table.   He takes
          a drag from her cigarette and passes it back.SUSIEGod damn!     I'm so sorry, baby.PHILYeah, out of a job again.SUSIEWould never have happened if you
                    were there.PHILHow do you know I wasn't?SUSIEWell, if you were, you wouldn't
                    have let him die.PHILI was still 'on staff'. He was
                    still my responsibility.8.CON TINUE D:They sit quietly for a moment.      Then:PHIL (CONT'D)So where have you been, anyway?She sighs, and stands up.PHIL (CONT'D)How long this time? Two weeks?SUSIEYeah, let's have this
                         conversation again. Like you
                         haven't just done six weeks on
                         the road...PHILYeah, but I usually leave a note.
                         And there's a paycheck involved.Susie disappears through the door. Phil's shoulders sag
          and he slumps against the wall. Then Susie reappears with
          a bottle of Jack Daniels and a couple of glasses. She
          pours out two generous measures and hands one to Phil.SUSIECome here...After a moment, he gets up and follows her out of the room.INT. PHIL'S SITTING ROOM. DAYSusie guides Phil to a chair and sits him down.PHILWhat's this?SUSIEThis is a remembrance.She crosses to a record player and turns it on, pausing to
          let down the blind on the way back. 'In My Hour of
          Darkness'(or similar music) fills the room.SERIES OFSHOTS:A) PHIL TAKES A DRINK.B) GIRL IN TEARS TO CAM OUTSIDE THE JOSHUA TREE MOTEL:GIRL(Earnestly)

                         feeling. I'll...(MOR E)9.CON TINUE D:GIR L (CONT'D)never laugh again. My inner joy
                         has gone. It evaporated when
                         Gram departed.C) MUSIC 'EXPERT' ON CHAT SHOWEXPERTHe sang country music in a way
                         that it had never been sung
                         before. It was 'country rock',
                         if you like. And it was kinda
                         catchy. At least, the young
                         people seemed to lap it up. It's
                         fair to say that when Gram
                         Parsons died, he died a star.D) PHIL TAKES ANOTHER DRINK.      HE MAY BE CRYING.E) HIPPIE TO CAM FROM A STREET IN LA:HIPPIEIt's like... I can't... It was

                         the desert. Gram Parsons - the
                         standard bearer of the new
                         country music movement - is dead,
                         following an overdose of drugs.
                         While many of America's young
                         people are today in mourning,
                         their parents will view this as
                         another example of how today's
                         drug culture can so easily claim
                         a life. We'll leave you tonight
                         with the young man's own words.
                         Gram Parsons wrote a song called
                         'In My Hour of Darkness', which
                         contains these words: 'In my hour
                         of darkness...'We are back in Phil's sitting room. Fade up on the music,
          to match the reporter's words, as Gram's voice fills the
          room: (or similar music).GRAM'S VOICEIn my hour of darkness, in my
                         time of need, Oh Lord grant me
                         vision, Oh Lord grant me speed.
                         Oh Lord grant me vision, Oh Lord
                         grant me speed.10.CON TINUE D:Susie tenderly throws a blanket over the sleeping Phil as
          the record ends. She turns the light off and the room goes
          dark.INT. PHIL'S SITTING ROOM. DAYSusie walks in with a coffee. She sits beside Phil and
          strokes his head until he wakes. She kisses him and passes
          him the cup.PHILHello.SUSIEHi.
          He sits up and stretches. She leans over to kiss him, then
          stands and starts to tidy. He watches her. She picks up
          some clothing from near his chair and moves away. He drops
          another piece of clothing on the same spot. She says
          nothing and picks it up. He takes a sock off and drops it.
          It has stopped being a game and started being a statement.
          She picks the sock up and drops it in his lap. He pushes
          it back onto the floor. She opens her arms and everything
          falls to the floor. She walks out of the room and into the
          kitchen. He follows.INT. PHIL'S KITCHEN. DAYSusie leans on the table, staring out of the window.   Phil
          walks up behind her.PHILWhen you're here, I spend my time
                         wondering when you're going. And
                         when you're back, I wonder where
                         you've been.She turns and walks round to face him.SUSIEPhil, you give me laughs and a
                         great time. But I'm not sure if
                         that's enough.PHILYou mean there's more than that?SUSIEYes, there's more than that!
                         There's dependable, responsible,
                         reliable...11.CON TINUE D:PHILThere's dull, boring, normal.
                         You should hook up with someone
                         who works in a bank. I know a
                         guy, actually. He has fish for
                         dinner every Friday, cleans his
                         shoes twice a week and buys his
                         ties in bulk because it works out
                         cheaper that way. I'll put you
                         in touch.SUSIEI don't mind loving a crazy
                         bastard, Phil. But you've got to
                         be for something and not just
                         against everything. You have to
                         choose something to represent.PHILI represent the combined forces
                         of charm, enchantment and
                         exuberance.SUSIEYour job is to arrange other
                         people's lives. Maybe it's time
                         to put a little thought into your
                         own.Susie walks out of the room.EXT. SUBURBAN STREET. DAYA suburban street of small, neat bungalows. We move down
          the street, past house and identical house, until we rest
          outside another that is identical to the rest. The front
          door opens, and a nondescript man emerges, carrying a small
          overnight bag. He carefully locks the door and walks down
          the path to where a cab waits. We can clearly see 'New
          Orleans Taxi' marked on the door.MANAirport, please.This is STANLEY PARSONS, Gram's father.INT. PHIL'S SITTING ROOM. DAYThere is a loud banging on the front door. Phil glances
          out of the window, and looks momentarily puzzled. He opens
          the door, and a beautiful woman stands on the step.PHILLong time, no see, Barbara.12.CON TINUE D:BARBARADon't try and schmooze me,

                     like it to be known that it is my
                     wish to leave Barbara Mansfield
                     my assets and belongings in the
                     event of my death. Signed:
                     Ingram Cecil Parsons.Phil looks surprised.PHILDid he write that with joined up
                     writing or was it before he knew
                     how?Barbara gives a wry smile.BARBARAStill the jester Kaufman, and
                     still very unfunny.PHILThat's not a will Barbara, and
                     you know it.BARBARAIt's better than a will,
                     actually. It's a signed promise
                     from Gram to leave me all his
                     assets and belongings. And
                     anyway, it's really none of your
                     business what this is. I've come
                     for the guitar.Phil shakes his head.PHILGuitar?BARBARAYes. Gram's guitar.   He always

          of chaos. Around them, the floor is covered with papers,
          clothing, empty record covers, torn open cushions and
          books. A broken drawer is propped against the table. A
          lampshade hangs crazily from its bearings, throwing strange
          shadows around the room. Suddenly, Susie gets up and kicks
          a cushion across the room.PHILHey, well done. You found the
                     only unbroken thing.SUSIEWhy did you let her in?PHILIt's all part of the grieving

          his feet sticking out of the back. Susie comes out of the
          house carrying the guitar, and sits on the steps, where she
          watches him. After a minute:SUSIEWhat are you doing?PHILThese things aren't that big.SUSIEOkay.    Is that a problem?PHILNot really.Susie is confused.17.CON TINUE D:SUSIEWell, that's good.No answer.      Phil continues to check out the inside of her

          Phil lies still. After a moment, she reappears with her
          bag. She flounces theatrically past him and opens the car
          door. Phil gets out of the back.SUSIEI don't know what this madness

          burns beside him, and sitar music plays in the background.
          This is LARRY OSTERBERG, and he is meditating. There is a
          loud hammering on the door. Larry shows no sign of having
          heard anything. More hammering at the door, but still no
          response. Then the letter box creaks open and an eye
          appears in the slot. After a moment, the eye disappears
          and Phil's face appears momentarily at the window. The
          window seems to be slightly higher than Phil, so his face
          appears every time he jumps up to peer into the room.PHIL(O.S)Hello? Anyone there?
          Then Phil is gone. Larry expels a big breath. The
          letterbox creaks opens again and the eye is back.PHIL (CONT'D)(O.S)There you are. I'm looking for
                    Larry Osterberg.Larry sighs, and stretches. He gets up slowly, gently
          shakes himself to relax his muscles and walks to the door,

          Stanley doesn't move. He peers at Stanley and shuffles in
          his seat, but there is still no reaction. Next, a deep
          sigh is forced out between his fat wet lips - he is plainly
          keen to start a conversation. Stanley keeps looking out of
          the window. He is watching the cargo being loaded.P. J. GAMBRELLPaw on the space, don'tcha think?Stanley turns slowly.31.CON TINUE D:STANLEYI'm sorry?The fat man smiles and extends a chubby hand, which Stanley

          and then, as they strain to identify it, they see a tiny
          dot on the road ahead of them, which grows and grows as
          they watch it, and they peer hard into the wind to identify
          it and... it's a motorcycle cop.PHIL (CONT'D)I don't believe it. Middle of
                         nowhere, and... quick - stand in
                         front of the car!EXT. HIGHWAY. DAYThey jump out of the car and shuffle sideways, until they

                         conversation.The buckled sign hangs dangerously above them as they both
          grin at the approaching policeman in a friendly manner.LARRYOkay.   What about?PHILI don't know what about! Ever
                         since I met you, you've talked.

                         is called, I think it works.LARRYWell... it's more a philosophy
                         than a religion.The cop does a U-turn and motors towards them.PHILOh, well done. Good work.He shoots a vicious look at Larry.      The cop parks his bike
          and removes his helmet.61.CON TINUE D:As he opens his mouth to speak, a headlight falls off the
          car and rolls off the road. They all watch it go.MOTORCYCLE COPAfternoon.PHILAfternoon, officer.    How's it
                         going today?The sign gives an ominous creak.         Larry takes a sideways

          Larry wobbles with shock.LARRYA body?     Stole a body?MOTORCYCLE COPA body. Rather like the one in
                     the back of your car.LARRYThat's an empty coffin, officer.The cop ignores him.        Phil lights his cigar.63.CON TINUE D: (3)MOTORCYCLE COPI know it sounds strange. But

                     our expense.The cop is no longer smiling.MOTORCYCLE COPIn the car, please.Phil opens the door and empty beer bottles cascade out into
          the road. They get into the car and the cop cuffs them
          together through the steering wheel and takes the car keys.
          Then he walks back over to his bike and starts to talk into
          the radio.INT. HEARSE. DAYPhil closes his eyes and shakes his head.PHILGod damn!LARRYHe said a body. He said we stole
                     a body.Phil opens his eyes.PHILHe meant a coffin.LARRYHe didn't say 'coffin'. He said
                     'body'. Tell me we haven't
                     stolen a real person.64.CON TINUE D:PHILLook, the place that I get the

          against the wheel.PHILJesus!They sit glowering out of different windows at different

                     we could suspend you from a

          his hand and slides it out of the handcuff. He hands the
          other cuff to Phil, who stares at him in astonishment.LARRYDo you think we should go?PHILYes, I think we should go.Larry starts the car. He throws it into reverse and the
          bumper slowly disengages from the metal signpost. Suddenly
          the car tears loose and flies backwards, smashing into the
          cop's motorcycle, leaving him holding the radio and its
          trailing wire. Larry slams on the brakes.LARRYOh shit.PHILNicely done.He rolls down his window and addresses the cop, who is
          staring with horror at his ruined motorcycle.PHIL (CONT'D)We'll be moving on, now that your

          the car sweeps past. The cop gets his gun out of his
          holster, and Phil reaches into the glove box and pulls out
          the screwdriver. He leans across Larry, jams it into the
          wheel column, and snaps the steering lock in two. The

          appeared in West L.A. Municipal Court on November 5, 1973 -
          Gram Parsons's 27th birthday. Since a corpse has no
          intrinsic value, the two were charged with misdemeanor
          theft for stealing the coffin and given a token punishment:
          $708 in damages for the coffin, and a $300 fine for each of
          the bodysnatchers.
