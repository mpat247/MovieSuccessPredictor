              J.D. BANKS (mid-20s, always looking for a good time) enters
              the office.J.D.Get your ass ready! It's almost five
                     o'clock and this bad boy needs to get his

              J.D. notices his friend pining over the photo.J.D.Oh God. Give me that.     I'm burning it
                     once and for all.
              J.D. snatches the photo, and pulls out his lighter. Just as
              the flame is about to touch the photo, BILLY grabs it back.BILLYDon't!J.D.Dude, it's been six months.    You have to
                     move on.
              BILLY nods knowingly.J.D.You know what'll cheer you up? Some hot

                     weekend to do that.BILLYNo I don't. The Germans are taking an
                     earlier flight back, so the meeting's
                     been moved to tomorrow.
              J.D. thinks for a moment.J.D.Well, why don't you just get somebody
                     else to do your work then?BILLYWho?

              Suddenly, we hear what sounds like be a match being lit, a
              gurgle, and a cough -- the distinct sounds of somebody
              smoking from a bong. Dr. Woodruff is confused. Kumar pulls
              out his cell phone. It's his personalized ringer.DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES     MAY 28 2003   5.KUMAR(to Dr. Woodruff)

          Dr. Woodruff is so shocked that the mug of coffee simply
          slips out of his hands. Hot coffee goes all over his shirt.
          Woodruff yells and starts wiping his shirt with a napkin.HAROLD (O.S.)Listen, I'd love to go home, but...KUMARNo fucking buts! I just bought a quarter

          looks nervously at FREAK SHOW, who doesn't seem to have heard
          a thing. Harold seems relieved.FREAK SHOWI heard every word you said.
          FREAK SHOW doesn't say anything else. HAROLD and KUMAR don't
          know how to react. They feel really uncomfortable. The fact
          that nothing happens makes it all the more awkward for them.DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   58.82   EXT. FREAK SHOW'S HOUSE - 1:30 AM                            82HAROLD (with laptop in tow) and KUMAR stand by their car, as

               walk towards FREAK SHOW's house...KUMARAm I deaf or did he just say we can fuck

                 Show...end up with a woman like yourself?LIANEWell, I met him at choir practice `bout
                 four years ago. Freak Show was very shy
                 back then-- you know, because of all the
                 hideous boils on his face and neck. But
                 he had the most amazing voice -- like a
                 baby canary.
          Harold and Kumar look at each other in disbelief -- "are we
          talking about the same Freakshow?"LIANEWell, one day after Easter service, I
                 told him how much I enjoyed his solo, and
                 he just mustered up some courage and
                 asked me out. The rest is history. And
                 we've been in love ever since.

          drinking their lemonade.LIANESo you boys gonna fuck me or what?
          HAROLD and KUMAR spit the lemonade out simultaneously. They

          Liane walks over to Harold, seductively. Harold is nervous
          and doesn't know what he should do. She takes his hand and
          puts it on the knot in her shirt. Harold looks over to Kumar,
          who gives him a reassuring nod. Harold then pulls on the
          cloth, causing the knot to come loose, thereby releasing her
          shirt. The shirt is now hanging and just barely covering her
          breasts.LIANE(to Harold, re: breasts)

          Harold looks over to Kumar, then back at Liane...HAROLDOkay, let's do that.
          Liane takes Harold's hands and places them on her breasts.
          Kumar looks on enviously. Liane moans in pleasure as Harold
          starts to massage her chest.

               HOSTESS-like PIE. The CASHIER (an OLD INDIAN MAN IN HIS
               SIXTIES) throws out a couple indecipherable protests...DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003    66.INDIAN CASHIER(to Cole and the punks)

          directions in Hindi-- it takes the Cashier a long time to
          explain it. He mentions numerous streets and routes. It
          sounds like it's very complicated.
          Meanwhile, while they are talking, HAROLD suddenly sees TWO
          MORE EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS enter the store, CARRYING A KAYAK
          AND A PADDLE. They carry the kayak to the back of the store.
          Harold has no idea what the hell is going on. KUMAR and the
          CASHIER are too busy talking to notice. Harold watches
          nervously as COLE PUTS ON A HELMET AND GETS INTO THE KAYAK...KUMARWho knew that learning Hindi would

               Cole looks pissed, but Kumar keeps his confident exterior.
               It's a tense moment.
               Suddenly, Cole makes a quick motion as if he was going to hit
               Kumar, trying to get him to flinch. Kumar stands his ground
               without flinching, still looking Cole in the eye. The Punks
               don't know what to think as their leader is shown up.
               Seemingly impressed by Kumar, Cole begins to turn around as
               if he's going to walk away, but he quickly doubles back,
               doing the same fake punch he did before. Caught off guard,

                 told him I haven't even been to Newark in
                 months. Then he pointed a gun at me and
                 told me to stop resisting arrest. I
                 said, "Hey, I'm not resisting anything."

          Harold watches as Cindy Kim sits down next to Goldstein.
