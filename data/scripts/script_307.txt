                          It's like saying to buy a car with tires.EXT. HOUSE -- NIGHTA wealthy neighborhood of Paris off the Champs Elysees. Large
               homes line the secluded street. We see the silhouette of a man in
               a Peugeot. We MOVE IN closer to see RAYMOND GAYET, 30's, waits
               nervously.INT. DARK ROOM -- NIGHTDark. DANIEL FORAY lights his Zippo lighter. He is late 30's,
               tall, handsome with eyes that seem to twinkle in the glow of the
               flame. Beside him is JULIEN LABESSE, 30's, hyper. Daniel places
               the LIGHTER on a small table and moves over to a PAINTING on the
               wall. Daniel stops at one, removes a pen knife and starts to cut
               the canvas from the frame.
               Daniel rolls up the canvas.2.DANIELLet's go.

               Julien starts to pick up the ZIPPO.DANIELBe careful it's...

               Too Late! Julien has already picked it up. It burns his hand ans
               he flicks it away. It flies through the air and lands in the corner
               of the room. The CURTAINS catch on fire.DANIEL... hot!

               Julien panics! He grabs the canvas out of Daniel's hand and begins
               beating the flames with it. Daniel looks at him with disbelief.
               Julien flails his arms wildly as he beats back the flames. He
               turns to Daniel pleased that his efforts have extinguished the
               fire, but unaware that the canvas has now caught on fire. A beat.
               Julien sees the flames and puts them out. Daniel just stares at
               him. He opens the canvas. The painting is ruined.EXT. STREET -- NIGHTA Mercedes parks in front of the Peugeot, boxing it in between it
               and a car behind it. The DRIVER gets out and walks away.INT. HOUSE FOYER -- NIGHTDaniel and Julien move through the darkness.DANIELLight your lighter. I can't see
                          anything... and try not to burn down
                          the house!

               Julien remove a lighter and presses it. The entire room fills
               with light. Julien stares at the flame amazed.OLD MAN'S VOICEDon't move!

               They turn to see an old man standing at the top of the stairs in
               his bathrobe. He is frail, his face pasty white. He is holding a
               very long, double-barrel shotgun.
               Julien looks to Daniel with a 'what now' expression. The old man
               slowly moves down the stairs. He loses his balance and falls down
               the stairs, tumbling head over heals until he reaches the bottom.
               Daniel and Julien stare at the old man who is sprawled out on the
               floor, motionless.JULIENIs he dead?DANIELI don't know.     He looks dead.3.JULIENHe looked dead before he fell.

               The old man groans, then opens his eyes.    He grabs his shotgun.
               Daniel and Julien run to the door.EXT. HOUSE -- NIGHTDaniel and Julien run towards the street.DANIELStart the car! Start the car!

               Raymond starts the engine.   Daniel and Julien rush across the street
               and get in the back seat.
               Raymond tries to pull out but there are only a few inches between
               the Mercedes in front and the car behind. Like a pinball stuck
               between two bumpers the Peugeot jerks rapidly back and forth.INT. PEUGEOT -- CONTINUOUSDaniel and Julien stare angrily ar Raymond.JULIENYou didn't think to move the car before
                          we came out!

               Daniel looks out his window and sees...
               DANIEL'S POV -- the old man runs out of his house with his shotgun
               and heads towards the car.
               Raymond is desperately trying to get the car free. They all slide
               down as the old man fires. The windows on the left side of the
               car shatter.DANIELRaymond, get us out of here!

               Raymond pops up and returns to getting the car out as the old man
               opens the breach of the shotgun to reload..
               Raymond floors the Peugeot keeping his foot on the brake. The
               engine revs. He turns the wheel to the left and releases the brake.
               The Peugeot juts forward smashing into the rear of the Mercedes
               and pushing in out into the street. Before the old man can take
               aim the Peugeot is speeding down the street.INT. PEUGEOT -- MOVING -- NIGHTRaymond bites his lip nervously as he drives.    Julien finds the
               whole thing amusing. Daniel leans forward.DANIEL(to Raymond)

               with Julien and Raymond. They enter a WAREHOUSE.INT. BASTALDI'S OFFICE -- DAYTwo large desks are lined up face to face. One is empty. The
               other is occupied by LAURANT BASTALDI, 40's, all business. Off to
               the side is MARCEL BUROT, 40's. Daniel, Julien and Raymond enter.
               As they approach the desk Daniel glances at Marcel who is staring
               at him.MARCEL(amused)
                          I heard you almost got your ass blown

                          black panther.

               Marcel glances at Bastaldi to see if he appreciates his comments.RAYMONDA Black Panther was a member of an African
                          American militant group in the sixties,
                          Marcel. I think you're referring to The

                          a fuckin' headache.

               A beat. Raymond and Marcel stare at one another.     We HEAR a muffled
               GROANING SOUND in the b.g.DANIELWhere's your brother?BASTALDIVincent's in the States on business.
                               (a beat; referring to

                          That it?

               Daniel lays the cardboard tube containing the painting on the desk.
               Bastaldi removes the painting. To him it is not a work of art,
               just a commodity to be sold. He opens his desk drawer, removes
               several large stacks of money and hands them to Daniel.BASTALDIOkay.   Now I've got something I want to --

               We HEAR the groaning sound again. Bastaldi looks irritated. He
               gets up and walks over to a closet. He opens to the doors to reveal
               a man in his underwear, his wrists tied behind his back, his mouth
               taped shut. A wire noose is around his neck forcing him to stand
               on his tip toes to avoid hanging himself.BASTALDIDo you mind? I'm trying to do some
                          business here.

               The man looks at Bastaldi through pleading eyes and mumbles
               something.BASTALDIOne more sound out of you and I'm going
                          to cut your fuckin' tongue out.

               Bastaldi closes the door.   Daniel looks at him inquisitively.BASTALDIYou take someone in. Give them a steady
                          job and how do they repay you? By
                          claiming to misplace a shipment of your

               Bastaldi looks puzzled.BASTALDII don't know.     What day is today?JULIENThursday.BASTALDIIs it Thursday already?    This week has
                          just shot by.

               Bastaldi thinks about something for a moment, then...BASTALDIYou and your crew speak English, don't
                          you?

               Daniel is still staring at the closet.BASTALDIHey Daniel! Hello?
                               (snaps his fingers)
                          Do you guys speak English?DANIELUh, yeah.BASTALDIGood.   I have a job for you in America.

               Bastaldi tosses a photo of a middle-aged American couple.   He points
               to a diamond necklace around the woman's neck.BASTALDIThe Taylors from Chicago. Very rich.
                          An acquaintance of mine recently quit

               They know they don't have a choice.JULIENWe're going to need to find someone who
                          knows the city.MARCELI know someone.EXT. NOTRE DAME -- DAYThe plaza is filled with tourists. Moving through the crowd is
               SAMI ZERHOUNI, Algerian, late 20's, a small time street hustler,
               dressed in jeans and a "I Love Paris" tee-shirt. He passes a
               MAN who is about to take a picture and lifts his wallet.
               Sami moves on. He sees two overweight women standing at a
               vendor's cart, holding a large wad of MONEY. The woman puts the
               cash back in her purse, but does not zip it up.
               Sami moves in behind her and slips his hand into the purse. She
               zips the bag closed. Sami's face fills with pain as the zipper
               catches the hair of his arm. The women walk towards the
               cathedral. Sami has no choice but follow after them. He tries
               to match their pace so he doesn't alert them of his presence.
               The woman looks back and sees Sami's hand. She pulls her bag
               away, ripping a section of hair off his arm, then swings the
               bag, putting all of her weight behind it. It hits Sami squarely
               in the face. He lands on his back with a thud. WALLETS and
               BILLFOLDS fly out from every one of his pockets.
               He staggers to his feet and starts to pick up the wallets when
               he sees...

               towards him .
               He knows he has no more time.    He takes off running, disappearing
               into the crowd.8.INT. CAFE -- LATIN QUARTER -- DAYSami is at the bar. He sees Marcel enter and runs towards the
               back. Standing in his way is one of Marcel's MEN. Sami turns
               around as Marcel approaches and forces a smile.

                           else. If I knew it was you I would have

               A long, awkward beat as Marcel just glares at him.SAMIYou're probably here for the money I owe

               Marcel punches Sami in the stomach. He drops to his knees. A
               beat. The door to the bathroom opens and the LARGE MAN peers
               inside. He stares awkwardly at what he perceives as the beginning
               of a sexual act.SAMITold you.

               Marcel slams the door then grabs Sami by the ear and yanks him to

               The door opens. ZERO enters. No one knows his last name. He is
               40's, blonde hair, leather jacket, black pants. Looks more like a
               rock-star than a criminal. His eyes are flat and there is an
               intensity about him that is unnerving. Zero casually nods to

               Sami laughs at his little joke. The others cringe. One look in
               Zero's eyes tells Sami what everyone else already knows: This is
               not someone to fuck with. Julien puts his arm around Sami and

               Zero turns on the radio and clicks through a few stations until he
               comes to RENAUD singing "Des que le vent souffera." He leans back
               in his seat, bobbing his head to the music. Marcel doesn't like
               it. He changes the station. We hear JOHNNY HALLYDAY singing, "Que
               je taime."MARCELThat's better.

               Zero doesn't like it. He pushes the button returning to the Renaud
               song and stares at Marcel. Marcel, not to be outdone returns the
               Hallyday song. Like two children they click the buttons of the
               radio, switching back and forth between Renaud and Hallyday.

               Sami lifts up a heavy brass lamp from the nightstand. He pulls
               the electrical cord out of the base, then touches two wires
               together. They spark. Before Hadley can say a word Sami touches
               them to his hand. Hadley's body jerks violent as he screams.
               Sami removes the wires. Hadley winces in pain from the burn mark
               on his hand.AGENT HADLEYOkay! Okay! We've been investigating
                          Zammito for years, but we've never had

                          told us that Zammito was talking with
                          other bosses and recording their
                          conversations in case they later claimed
                          they weren't involved. Look at these
                          tapes. The guy has recorded every
                          conversation he's had for years.DANIELSo we rob Zammito. You arrest us when

               grabs a few things off the table.DANIELI'll be back in an hour.

                          shot. It didn't work. Did you bring

                          real moron.

               Hadley removes a small cassette player from his jacket.    He picks
               a tape and inserts it into the player.ZAMMITO'S VOICEI just came by to tell that "piece of

                          guy. He's a congressman.BONANNO'S VOICEI made Peter Dimiano a congressman. We

               Hadley grins.   This is great stuff.   He looks up at Sami.AGENT HADLEYHere you go, sport.

               Sami grabs the box and leaves. Hadley starts whistling a tune and
               walks off the other way. As he reaches the tree line Lamar pops
               out with two of his friends. All of them have guns.LAMARI'll take the bag.AGENT HADLEYYou don't think I see through this?     You
                          tell Sami he's dead.

               One of Lamar's guys searches through Hadley's pockets, finds his
               gun, then takes his wallet.AGENT HADLEYYou're making a big mistake.    I'm an FBI
                          agent.

               Hadley stares at Lamar defiantly. Lamar cocks the hammer back on
               his gun and presses the barrel to Hadley's forehead. Hadley drops
               the canvas bag.

               Lamar picks up the canvas bag and runs away. Hadley stands there
               fuming. Lamar runs towards the statue and disappears behind it.ANGLE -- BEHIND THE STATUE96.Daniel is waiting, holding the other black canvas bag.   As Lamar
               passes they quickly exchange bags.

               From Hadley's point of view Lamar has merely run behind the statue
               as he heads for the street. Lamar runs a few more steps, then
               stumbles and falls... several cassette tapes spill out of it.
               Lamar's buddies are already at the street.LAMAR'S BUDDIESC'mon, man!   Let's get out of here.

               Lamar gets up, looks at the bag, pretends to be panicked.   He runs
               off leaving the bag laying on the grass.

               ON HADLEY: He can't believe his luck. He runs over, picks up the
               loose cassettes and puts them back in the bag, then leaves.

               ON DANIEL: he peers out from behind the fountain, watching as
               Hadley walks off in the other direction.EXT. STREET CORNER -- MORNINGDaniel arrives to find Sami and Lamar.SAMISee, I told you that you could trust me.

               The color drains from Hadley's face.   Sami reappears, talking into
               the camera again.SAMIIt's a little arty I know, but it has
                          great content, don't you think? You

                          probably didn't even think about a video

                          the day off.

               The tape turns to static. Hadley tries to think. He takes the
               VHS tape from the machine, then picks up his phone and starts to
               dial a number. A beat. He thinks better of it, hangs up and uses

               They are right on the edge of having a major disaster. The Dean
               Martin song ends. Dead quiet. Each group watches the other to
               see who's going to make the first move.
               The jukebox selects another record. The needle scratches against
               the vinyl intro. We hear the intro to JERRY VALE singing "Amore
               Scusami".SERIES OF QUICK CUTS--   Raphael's eyes burn into Zammito's

               Raphael goes for his gun.   All hell breaks loose! People dive for

               Eddie lifts a shotgun from behind the bar and blows away a gang
               member. Another gang member kills him.
               It's a massacre! Bodies drop like flies. The room is so thick

               We move through the room, past the carnage. Smoke swirls, blood
               covers the floor. Raphael is dead. Along with Joey "Two Tons"
               and Nicky "The Rake" On the floor, Zammito is against the bar.
               He sits up, amazed that he is untouched. He gets to his feet and
               makes his way to the front door.EXT. SOUTH SIDE SOCIAL CLUB -- AFTERNOONMusic continues. Zammito staggers outside and into the street.

               the windshield he can see the smiling face of Half Tooth Tony.
               The front of the car slams into Zammito, lifting him into the air.
               He flips head over heals then smashes into the windshield and over
               the car. He lays in the middle of the street, dead.

               steps, then stops.

               BASTALDI POV -- across the street, standing side by side are Daniel,
               Sami, Raymond, Marcel and Zero. They look like a ragged bunch,
               tired, dirty. We PAN across the faces of each one of them as they
               stare at Bastaldi.

               A BUS goes by blocking Bastaldi's view of the boys.   When it passes
               the crew it gone!

               Bastaldi bites his lip nervously.    Bastaldi looks around, but there
               is no sign of them.A DIFFERENT ANGLEWe can see the five of them crouched behind a parked car. Marcel
               peers through the window at Bastaldi who is still trying to figure
               out where they went. They are all amused with Bastaldi's

               surface. The phone rings. He knows who is calling. He stares at
               the phone for a long moment, then he slowly lifts the receiver.BASTALDIHello?DANIEL (V.O.)(in French)

               DANIEL'S POV: Bastaldi appears on deck. He puts the suitcase in
               the rowboat and unties it. It drifts slowly into the current.EXT. DOWN RIVER -- AFTERNOONThe rowboat hugs the shore, moving slowly down the river. Marcel
               is on the shore with Raymond. Raymond reaches out with a long
               pole and pulls the boat to shore. Marcel opens the case. Inside

               cassette tapes in the cardboard box.
               Bastaldi grins and lifts the cardboard box out of the chest. He
               hears a CLICK. He notices something is attached to the bottom of
               the cardboard box. It's a long thin wire that has pulled the pin
               on an electronic device.EXT. ACROSS THE RIVER -- CONTINUOUSDaniel is now holding small, black device. A yellow light starts

               Raymond opens the suitcase and looks inside. As he peels through
               the stacks of money we see that only the top bill of each stack is
               real -- underneath them all is white paper, cut to the same size
               as the bills. Everyone turns to Marcel.DANIELYou didn't check it?108.EXT. BRIDGE -- AFTERNOONThe five of them walk across the bridge.MARCELI'm sorry! I was caught up in the

                          before?

               No one answers him. Sami reaches inside the black canvas bag and
               removes the autographed baseball Marcel took from Zammito.SAMIThis is great. After everything we've

               Marcel tries to take the ball out of the bag. Sami pulls it away.
               Marcel grabs the bag. Both of them tug on it. Marcel pulls hard
               and the bag rips down the seam. The baseball falls out and rolls
               off the bridge into the river.SAMIPerfect.

               Marcel stands there holding the inside liner of the bag.
               Sami throws the canvas bag to the ground in frustration.
               Something catches Daniel's attention.

               DANIEL'S POV -- of the black canvas. The lining has been ripped
               away. A light breeze blows lifting the underside of the black
               canvas. There is a flash of color. Another gust of wind turns
               the black canvas over. On the other side is Van Gogh's "Vase with
               twelve sunflowers".

               Daniel's jaw drops.   The others notice his stunned expression and
               follow his stare.

               They have almost reached the painting when a truck passes them.
               The wind kicks up the painting, blowing it over the railing. They
               reach out to grab it, but it is too far away. They stand there,
