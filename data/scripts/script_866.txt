	Over BLACK, we HEAR the sounds of an old TAPE RECORDING.
	Young VOICES are filtered amid a noticeable hum, hiss and
	crackle. We HEAR giggling and then someone named Charlie

	Charlie starts giggling. We HEAR fumbling and tickling.

	CLOSE VIEW INTO THE KITCHEN - First we see a woman's hand, on
	the floor. It is partially covered with flour.

	MOVING VIEW reveals PEGGY BODELL, in her early 40's, fainted
	from heartbreak while baking a cake. Flour is scattered on

	A workman approaches carrying an old mono record player:
	black and white, a real fifties artifact. For a moment their
	mutual resentment melts, as they look at each other.PEGGYThat stays.

	The workman looks to Charlie for approval. Charlie nods. The
	workman shrugs, and heads back to the basement.CHARLIEYou got a Tab?PEGGYI don't buy them anymore. You were

	moves to another. Charlie checks the contents of another box
	on the other side of the room.PEGGYAre you taking Janet to the reunion

	shaped cake in silver icing: 25th Reunion � Buchanan High.'CAROLWho's the mother around here?BETHSometimes I wonder.INT. TELEVISION STUDIOA television studio set made up of platforms covered with
	black cloth. Placed around the platforms on different levels
	are projection TVs, regular TVs, microwave ovens and other

	(or a table) as a CHINESE WAITER rushes in and puts a tray of
	fortune cookies down.WAITERHere Charlie, extra fortune
		cookies. Good luck.CHARLIEThanks.

	Charlie grabs a cookie and puts it on the table in front of
	him, smashing it with his fist. He picks up and reads the
	fortune:CHARLIE(manic)

		he's smashed too many fortune
		cookies.BETHCome on Mom. Give him a break. He's
		missing the reunion because of you.
		You know he wants to go.PEGGYThen we'd both have a miserable

	artificial bird perched on its top. The throne and altar look
	like a set left over from a summer stock "Macbeth".

	Peggy and Barney enter. Several men lead Peggy away from
	Barney to the throne. One man places a go1den cape around her
	shoulders. They lead her up the platform to the throne.HENRYHey, George. Get the lights.

	The LIGHTS are DIMMED. The room is lit by the candles.

	The men form a semi�circle around Peggy. Old men at the end
	of their lives, they are serious and passionate about the
	possibilities of life beyond this world. One by one, four men
	from either end of the line approach the altar with
	offerings: a cup of wine; an egg; a gold coin; and a rose.
	The men rejoin the line.

	LEO COOPER, a tall, white�haired man, takes two steps
	forward. The other men begin to sing a Gregorian chant.LEO(to Peggy)
		Are you ready, dear?PEGGYYes, sir.

	Leo steps back, closes his eyes and spreads his arms.PEGGYFasten your seat belts. Here we go.LEOLord of the Universe, Vast and
		Mighty One. Ruler of Light, King
		of~ the sun. Creator of earth, air,
		fire and water.
			(kneeling down)
		We adore thee and invoke thee!
		Grant thine aid.
		Look with favor upon us as we
		witness the regeneration of man. We
		behold the innocent endeavors of
		single�minded men and women. For we
		are the company of unbodied souls
		and immortal angels. We ask thy
		intervention, that this girl may
		return to thee on the wings of your
		Love.PEGGY(sotto)
		This is never going to work.

	The old men form a circle in front of Peggy. They begin to
	circumambulate east to west, intoning together, their heads
	bowed. As Barney passes in front of Peggy, he winks at her.
	She smiles back.MENFount of life, Chariot of the
		Spirit, Womb of the Mother, reclaim
		thy child of light.

	We HEAR a clap of distant THUNDER. Peggy trembles. The
	artificial bird falls off the plant. Peggy is struck with
	amazement. She begins to glow, poised to take off. The men
	continue to chant while:LEO (O.S.)The name of your love is sacrifice.
		We offer up this girl, that her
		soul may find its home.

	Suddenly a door is opened, a gust of wind pours in and
	extinguishes the candles, plunging the hall into darkness.LEO (0.S.)Nothing to worry about. Somebody
		get the lights.

	The LIGHTS are TURNED ON. All the men look to the throne.

	Peggy is gone. They are speechless for a couple of beats.GEORGE(chipper)
		Well, the girl's gone. Let's play
		some poker.

	CLOSE ON BARNEY � He smiles, happy that she made it. George
	crosses to the wall, reaches behind the drapes and presses a
	button. The wall slides open to reveal a fully�equipped card
	room. The men shuffle in.EXT. BEHIND THE LODGECharlie carries Peggy off towards his car, one hand covering
	her mouth. Peggy struggles. When they reach the car, he puts
	her down. She's still wrapped in her golden robe.PEGGYWhat the hell did you do that for?
		What are you doing here?CHARLIEI was trying to save you. They were
		going to vaporize you.PEGGYDon't be ridiculous! They're just a
		bunch of harmless old men. My
		grandfather was in there.CHARLIEYou're going to listen to me.

	Charlie tries to Lead Peggy into the car.PEGGYI'm not getting in that blue
		monstrosity.

	Charlie pushes her inside, Peggy climbs back out. Charlie
	takes her hand and drags her up a hill behind the lodge hall.PEGGYLet me got! Where are you taking
		me?CHARLIERight here. Now sit down.

	Charlie sits her down on the ground. She's impatient and
	hopping mad.CHARLIELook. I wanna tell you. I forgive
		you for everything. I know what
		you've been going through. You're
		just scared. I was scared, too, but
		I'm not anymore.PEGGYHow could you possibly know what
		I've been going through?

	Thunder and lightning. It starts to rain.CHARLIEBecause I love you, damnit! I had a
		long talk with your father
		yesterday and we decided that the
		best thing for us to do is get
		married and settle down. Right
		away.

	Peggy jumps up, exploding to Charlie.PEGGYWhat do you mean you and my father
		decided? Who the hell are you to
		plan my life? Let's get married and
		live happily ever after. Bullshit.
		I got knocked up. I had to marry
		you. I never had a choice.CHARLIEWhat?PEGGYYou betrayed me, Charlie. You were
		never there for me or the children.
		And now you come and tell me,
		"Peggy, you're scared." Of course
		I'm scared. If you knew what I knew
		you'd be scared shitless.CHARLIEYou're crazy! You're really out of
		your mind!PEGGYI might be crazy, but I'm not crazy
		enough to marry you twice. There's
		a lot of things I can't change. I
		can't even think about them. I
		tried. But I couldn't even help
		Rosalie.
			(tears start)
		I don't want to be bitter. I'm a
		naturally optimistic person. But
		you took advantage of that.

	Charlie bends down to comfort her, in tears. He hugs Peggy
	and strokes her hair.CHARLIEOh, Peggy. My poor Peggy. It's all
		my fault. I'm so sorry. I won't
		bother you anymore. I promise.
		Please stop crying. Please.

	Peggy starts to compose herself.PEGGYWill you take me back to my
		grandparents?CHARLIEOf course.

	Charlie helps her up. Be reaches into his pocket and takes
	out a small box, handing it to Peggy.CHARLIEIt's almost your birthday. I wasn't
		sure when you were coming back, so
		I brought your present up here.

	With a slow, growing remembrance, Peggy opens the box. Inside
	is the gold locket Peggy was wearing at the reunion.PEGGY(anguished)
		Oh, Charlie.CHARLIEIt opens, too. Look inside.

	Peggy opens the locket. She shivers with recognition.INSERT - LOCKETTwo photos, one of Peggy, one of Charlie, as children.PEGGYScott and Beth. Where did you get
		these?CHARM EWho's Scott and Beth? Your mother
		gave me our picture. That's you and
		me.PEGGYSo are Scott and Beth.

	Peggy leans into Charlie, throwing her arms around him,
	holding on for dear life. She looks up at him, their
	foreheads touching.CHARLIE(tenderly)
		I love you.PEGGYI know.

	Charlie kisses her, passionately. The locket drops to the
	ground. HOLD on the locket, and...DISSOLVE:EXT. ON THE HILL - LATERCharlie and Peggy are lying on the ground, gazing up. A flash
	of lightning streaks across the sky.CHARLIEI think we should get out of here.
		It's going to rain.PEGGY(musing)
		Do you think anybody in the Fifties
		ever made love on a bed?CHARLIEWhat the hell is that?

	Flying high above them is an enormous, glowing, liquid neon
	kite. The center of the kite inscribed in lights, flashing
	like a marquee: HAPPY BIRTHDAY PEGGY SUE.

	The kite begins to descend towards them. Peggy jumps to her
	feet and races towards it. She grabs the tail and starts to
	sail away with the kite. Charlie chases after her.CHARLIEPeggy! Where're you going? Come
		back!PEGGYI've got to go now.CHARLIEBut I love you. I'll love you
		forever.PEGGYI'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll
		love you for twenty years.CHARLIECome back to me.PEGGYI'm trying.

	As Charlie watches helplessly, a huge bolt of lightning
	strikes his car. Peggy smiles. The men from the lodge run
	outside. They look up and above the blazing car and see Peggy
	floating away. Peggy sees her grandfather in the crowd and
	blows him a kiss. Charlie begins to run, following the kite
	cord to its source. He finds Richard, struggling to restrain
	the runaway kite.CHARLIERichard, do something!RICHARDI can't! It's out of control!

	Suddenly the cord breaks. Peggy floats away.CHARLIEPeggy!

	Charlie, Richard and the old men behold Peggy, bobbing and
	dipping playfully in the sky. We begin to HEAR Charlie's
	VOICE singing "Peggy Sue" O.S. Peggy looks down with wonder
	at the earth, and then like a comet, soars into the
	blackness. In an instant she becomes a star.FINAL SCENEDISSOLVE/OPTICALHOSPITAL ROOM - DAYMoving from two to C.U. Peggy, fragments of the reunion, the
	cake coming towards her, fragments of words in echo effect:
	'Your heart stopped for a while..." Father's voice:
	'You're a very lucky young lady...' Doctor: 'A (explain) of
	the head...' Mom's voice: 'But you're going to be all right
	now, the paramedics got there...' Mom, 'We were so
	worried..."

	Echoing of, until once voice is left. Charlie. Sitting
	opposite her bed, as he has been every minute of her illness.
	He looks wan and old, worried sick, but trying to sing 'Peggy
	Sue' for her.CHARLIE(singing softly).
		Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need
		you Peggy Sue...PEGGYCharlie? Was I dead?CHARLIEI thought you were...for a while.PEGGY(affectionately)

		without you.PEGGYWhat about Janet?CHARLIEThat's over. I got tired of
		translating everything. She thought
		the Big Hopper was a hamburger.

	Charlie laughs uncomfortably and Peggy Sue looks around her
	hospital room.PEGGYWho are all the flowers from?

	Charlie pushes himself out of his chair and moves toward the
	dresser.CHARLIEEveryone.  Maddie and Arthur, Carol
		and Walter. Richard Norvick.  And
		here's a book, by that guy from
		high school, Michael Fitzsimmons. 
		He dedicated it to you.

	Charlie returns to Peggy's bedside and opens the front cover
	of the book.

	ANGLE ON BOOK: the front page bears the title "The Pilgrim
	Soul" and the dedication reads "to Peggy Sue and a Starry
	Night".

	Peggy smiles but shakes her head.PEGGYIt couldn't be me.  I hardly knew
		him.CHARLIEI'll just set it right here.

	He places the book on her bedside table as he sits back down.PEGGYCharlie, I had a strange
		experience.  I went back to high
		school. And I spent a lot of time
		with you.  And you and Walter and
		Leon were singing "I Wonder Why".CHARLIEOh, God, Dion.PEGGYYou were terrific.  And I kept
		trying to push you away but you
		wouldn't give up.CHARLIEI'll never give up.PEGGYThen hold me.

	He holds her hand.CHARLIEI loved you since the day I met

		away. But I would do what I can...PIGGYCharlie, please, I need some time.CHARLIEWell, I'll let you get some

	The VIEW PULLS BACK past the flowers. Charlie starts to exit.
	Checks himself in the mirror.PEGGYCharlie, I would like to invite you
		to dinner at home, on Sunday, with

	He hurries back to her, kisses her again.
