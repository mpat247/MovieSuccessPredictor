          Inside the second safe, a large envelope.

          Putin grins, heading for the door. He never makes it. In a sudden
          violent motion,, Ramius kicks Putin's left leg from under him.
          Surprised, the; big man tumbles sideways.
          Leaping to his feet, Ramius catches Putin, slamming him into a
          headlock, driving his thick neck downward, CRACKING his SKULL
          in the SHARP corner of the DESK.
          Putin gags. Cupping his chin, Ramius forces his entire bulk onto

          Greer nods. Order in the room has broken down. Generals and
          Admirals argue vehemently about appropriate. responses. Staring at
