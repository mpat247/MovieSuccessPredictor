                                      Paul SchraderSHOOTING DRAFT1992JOHN LETOUR, forty, light sleeper. Never meant to be a drug 
               dealer, it just came along. He's been other things: messenger 
               boy, cab driver, model, postal clerk, doorman, nightclub 
               shill -- never meant to be them either. Now he's a D.D. Drug 
               dealer.

               JOHN LETOUR, well-groomed, khaki slacks, leather jacket, 
               tippet-like scarf, belt pouch, "Beatle" boots, a shadow 
               drifting in and out of other shadows, New York, day, night: 
               watching, listening, rarely speaking -- nonexistent, seen 
               only by those he sees. His face an affable blank. Make of it 
               what you will. The eyes flicker; the hands shift discreetly. 
               A map of calculation.

               Once he had a drug problem. Life turned a page. Today he 
               follows instructions: he sleeps light -- one eye open, 
               anticipating. JOHN LETOUR, D.D., loner, voyeur, has been 
               drifting toward an unknown destination. At mid-life the 
               destination draws near. The circle tightens. The dealer is 
               anxious. The destination is love.NIGHT IN THE LIFECREDIT SEQUENCE: New York by night. JOHN LETOUR nestles in 
               back of a blue car service sedan, face reflected in the 
               window. Neon mixes with steam, street people with tourists, 
               young dates: each with a different agenda, a hidden purpose.

               His beeper goes off. He clicks it, checks the digital message. 
               The DRIVER stops at an uptown corner. LETOUR opens the 
               curbside door, motions to the DRIVER he'll be back in "ten" 
               minutes. He enters the video laundromat, a twenty-four-hour 
               video rental/laundromat/tanning salon.

               Inside, he meets a RETRO-YUPPIE (J. Crew Division) in the 
               "Classics" section. They exit.

               On the sidewalk, money is exchanged for a packet. LETOUR 
               pockets the uncounted cash. The YUPPIE mouths goodbye, eager 
               to put distance between him and LETOUR. JOHN checks his 
               beeper, stops at a pay phone, dials.

               JOHN LETOUR re-enters the sedan; the DRIVER heads downtown. 
               High-rises give way to Tudor City. Uncollected trash lines 
               the curbs. LETOUR eyes a PEDESTRIAN; PEDESTRIAN looks back. 
               Later. Three a.m. The streets are dark. LeTour's car passes 
               a glowing Korean market.

               LETOUR narrates from diary:LETOUR(voice over)
                         Labor Day weekend. Some time for a 
                         sanitation strike. Everybody crazy 
                         to stock up. They decide to score at 
                         the last minute and want it now. 
                         Never fails. The faces look alike. 
                         You gotta use memory tricks: each 
                         has some peculiarity -- it keeps you 
                         sharp. A D.D. told me when a drug 
                         dealer starts writing a diary it's 
                         time to quit. I started writing after 
                         that. Not every night -- now and 
                         then. Just to burn off the night. 
                         Fill up one book, throw it out, start 
                         another.

               The sedan drives on. End credits.CUT TO:HOMEBASEFour a.m.: streets empty. LeTour's sedan drops him off near 
               a ten-story West 80s apartment building. JOHN gives the DRIVER 
               a forty-dollar tip (standard procedure), turns the corner. 
               He presses the intercom; a buzzer unlocks the door. He enters 
               the lobby, walks past English reproduction furniture toward 
               the elevators. Presses the button.

               Penthouse C door opens. ANN lets JOHN in with a smile.

               ANN, forty-four, striking in a tailored dress, greets him 
               with a wet kiss. Her hair is coiffured, her face made up. 
               She is John's employer, mentor, confidante, Mother Hen: she 
               keeps the books. Her ingenuous demeanor belies sterner stuff: 
               she's been in the drug business fifteen years.

               Ann's apartment is a jumble of sensibilities: dark green 
               walls, zebra-skin sofa, Haitian wall friezes, framed magazine 
               photos of Paramahansa Yogananda, Liz Taylor, the Duke of 
               Windsor -- paintings stacked behind an oversized urn. A bird 
               flits in its cage. One corner of the living area is devoted 
               to a fledgling cosmetics business: Macintosh computer, 
               billboard of trade paper clippings and ads, herbal samples, 
               reference books, color charts.

               ROBERT, fifty, slight, waves hello as JOHN locks the door. 
               Gay, hip, worn, he's John's "co-runner."

               They work -- and eat -- out of Ann's apartment. Take-out 
               tins of Indian food are stacked amid crystals, tarot cards, 
               glasses, and vitamin bottles. No sign of drugs, drug 
               paraphernalia, or money.ANNDarling.LETOURAnn.ANNHave we made New York safe for another

               He throws two kisses, exits.CUT TO:JOHN'S APARTMENTFirst light reflects across the Hudson as LETOUR walks west 
               on 22nd Street toward his Chelsea apartment building. A 
               delivery truck passes uncollected garbage. He enters a 
               nondescript doorway. Inside his studio apartment, JOHN sits 
               at a second-hand table writing in a composition book. He 
               drinks from an eight-ounce glass of white wine, continues.

               The room has little personality; Ann's apartment has enough 
               for two. Nails indicate where pictures once hung; a boombox 
               sits on the linoleum floor amid cassettes, books 
               (Autobiography of a Yogi, The Secret Doctrine), fashion 
               magazines, a stack of unopened CDs. A futon is unrolled 
               beneath the room's sole decoration, a poster of a human foot 
               advertising a forgotten photo exhibit. Wine bottles -- Chenin 
               Blanc. Precious little to show for forty years.

                         I had nothing to do with Marianne -- 
                         she jumped: she was there, then she 
                         was gone.

                         Fire! Fire! Fire!

               The fire bell rings.

               THOMAS, TIS, and the CUBAN stare dumbfounded.

               LETOUR reaches behind his shirt in the confusion, yanks out 
               the .38 with a painful rip, turning, fires point-blank into 
               the Cuban's chest. BLAM! Shirt fabric flares, flies: the 
               CUBAN falls with blank expression.

               THOMAS, off guard, wheels and fires wildly at LETOUR.

               JOHN fires back. Both are hit. TIS ducks into the bedroom.

               THOMAS and LETOUR fire again, again -- hitting, missing. A 
               bullet hits its mark: THOMAS, frozen, grabs his blood-spurting 
               throat, slumps to floor.

               LETOUR bleeds from the stomach and shoulder. His shirt soaks 
               red; he struggles to stand. CUBAN and THOMAS -- both dead. 
               LETOUR checks the .38: five rounds fired -- one left.

               LETOUR staggers into the bedroom, finds TIS frantically 
               searching an open suitcase. Off-screen VOICES under the fire

                         I didn't --

               LETOUR steps to TIS, aims, shoots him barrel to forehead. 
               Exit debris hits the wall. He is dead.

               Off-screen screams of guests are countered by commands from 
               hotel security: "Get down!" "Get back!" Fire horns and sirens 
               reverb from the street.

               LETOUR, losing consciousness, sits bedside. Gun slips from 
               his hand.

               Deflating, he drifts back-first to the bedspread. Blood 
               spreads. His eyes are open.

               ANN walks through a concrete corridor, finds the visiting 
               area.

               LETOUR, in prison fatigues, sits at a table. He sees her, 
               smiles.
