	Quincy follows Kelvin's eyes, to a beat-up pair of Converse

	Monica catches the ball and throws up a shot.  It banks off
	the backboard...AND DROPS THROUGH THE NET.  The boys look at
	her in shock.  Monica tosses the ball back to Quincy.MONICAOne, up.QUINCYLucky.

	Quincy easily dribbles by Kelvin and lays up the ball.  He
	throws the ball back to Monica.

	Quincy can't believe it.  Kelvin cracks up.KELVINAaah, she dogged you.JAMALShut up.

	The game continues, with Quincy and Monica trading baskets
	for their teams.  Quincy grows agitated with Jamal, who is
	unable to stop her.  The score hits nine, nine.

	Quincy stands at the top of the driveway, ball in hand.QUINCYPoint.

	Quincy dribbles through his legs, then pops an outside shot.
	The ball bounces on the rim...and rolls off.

	Quincy curses as Monica grabs the rebound and clears the

	Quincy stumbles, giving her a step.  Kelvin throws it back.

	Quincy does a jump kick.  Monica does the same.

	Quincy takes a couple steps back, then does a cartwheel.  It
	looks great, until he crashes into the box with the cake.
	The cake falls onto his head and shoulder.

	TWELVE YOUNG WOMEN sit on the first two rows of bleachers.
	The eight upperclassmen kick back in the second row,
	comfortable, confident.  Monica and the three other freshmen
	sit in front of them, jiggling nervously.

	COACH MILLER stands in front of the team.COACH MILLERI don't know some of you very well yet,

		being nice to you.

	Laughter from the upperclassmen.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		But my philosophy is simple. Hard work
		and sacrifice.
		There's a lot of basketball history and
		pride here at USC, but just putting on
		the cardinal and gold doesn't make you a
		great player.  Hard work and sacrifice
		makes you a great player.  What you were
		doesn't matter anymore.  For the first
		time in your life, you won't be the best.
		You'll be going up against women that are
		bigger and stronger and better than you
		ever imagined.  So the question is, how
		will you respond?  Well, your answer
		better be hard work and sacrifice because
		that's the only way you're gonna make it
		through.  Vince Lombardi preached it and
		I teach it, "There is only one way to
		succeed at anything and that is to give
		everything."

	Coach Miller pauses a moment to let her words sink in.
	Monica glances at her fellow freshman for their reactions.
	Like her, a lot of cockiness, a lot of fear.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		A few simple rules.  Eleven o'clock

		time, no exceptions.  Attend every class,
		no exceptions.  No drugs, no alcohol, no
		getting pregnant.  And finally, respect
		yourselves, respect your coaches and
		respect your teammates, right Sidra?

	his size and strength.  He scores seven straight points.

	The score stays close.  It is a sexually-charged battle of
	wills -- Quincy pulls off his sweat-soaked shirt.  Their
	bodies collide as they wrestle for the ball.  Monica yanks
	off her jersey in frustration.  Her ass bumps into his hips
	as she backs him in.  Her hands slide across his chest as she
	guards him...

	Finally, the score hits nine, nine.  Monica slowly walks to
	the top of the key.MONICANine, up.  Point.

	She tosses Quincy the ball.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		Check.

	Quincy tosses the ball back, drops low on defense.  Monica
	fakes an outside shot and Quincy bites.  Monica drives around
	him.  SHE HAS A WIDE-OPEN LAY-UP.  SHE PUTS IT UP..AND IT
	ROLLS OFF THE RIM.  Monica can't believe it.

	Quincy grabs the loose ball and clears it.  He stares at
	Monica as he dribbles in front of her.  She stares back.

	He breaks for the basket.  Monica stays with him.  He goes
	up.  Monica jumps, desperately tries to block his shot.
	Quincy dunks on her, knocking her to the ground.  He lets go
	of the rim, and tumbles to the ground also.  GAME OVER.

	Silence.  Quincy stares at her.  Monica looks back.  Then:QUINCY(pointed)
		All's fair in love and basketball, right?

	Monica struggles to fight back her tears as she picks herself up.
	She slowly walks back toward her house.  And then:

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Hey.

	Monica slowly stops, turns.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Double or nothing.

	Monica stares at him, wonders if she heard right.  Quincy
	limps to his feet, picks up the ball and holds it out to her.

	Monica slowly walks back to him.  They stare at each other.
	No more egos, no more bullshit.  Just love.

	REPORTER interviews him.SPORTS REPORTERSo, Magic, are you contemplating another
		comeback?MAGIC(laughs)
		No more comebacks.  Tonight I'm just

	Behind him, in a second row seat, a ONE YEAR BLACK GIRL sits
	in a lap, bouncing, watching feet and legs ballin' on the
	court.

	Quincy leans down, gives the little girl a kiss, then looks
	out at the court.  It's the Los Angeles Sparks and the New
	York Liberty.  The WNBA.

	On the court, the women line up for a free-throw.QUINCYLet's go, McCall!

	Monica, sporting a uniform with Wright-McCall on the back and
	the number thirty-two, looks over.  Quincy takes their
	daughter's hand and waves it.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Go Mommy.

	Monica smiles back, then steps to the line.  The referee
	tosses her the ball.  Monica stares at the basket, then
	bounces the ball twice, licks her lips and shoots.FADE TO BLACK."THAT'S GAME"END CREDITS
