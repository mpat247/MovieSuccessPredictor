          a row of hedges that have been pruned to read: 'WELCOME TO
          CAPE COD.' A moment later a FLASHING COP CAR flies by in HOTPURSUIT.INT. MINI-VAN - SAMEThe WINDSHIELD IS GONE and the wind blows back the hair of
          two BEAT-UP-LOOKING MEN. The driver, FRED SEARING, 40-ish,
          has a look of determination and resolve on his chunky face,
          despite the BLACK EYE and BLOOD-STAINED TISSUE dangling out
          of his nose. The nervous passenger is RICK MILLS, 38.RICKPull over, man!FREDNo way, I can out-run 'em!RICKNo you can't--not in this thing!
          Another POLICE CRUISER FISHTAILS OUT OF A SIDE STREET andJOINS THE CHASE.RICK (CONT'D)Oh God, now there's two of 'em!FREDI don't care--I'm not stopping 'til

          wife!ESTABLISHING SHOT OF A CAPE COD HOSPITAL - NIGHTRick and Fred come SKIDDING UP to the EMERGENCY ENTRANCE
          followed by the two police cruisers. When they stop, we see
          that somebody has spray-painted 'HORNY OLD MAN' on the side
          of the mini-van.
          Fred jumps out and SPRINTS toward the entrance. SEVERAL COPS
          spring from their cars and give chase. Before Fred can reach
          the front doors, he gets KNOCKED VIOLENTLY to the ground.
          Rick climbs out of the passenger seat with HIS HANDS RAISED.RICKHear me out, gentlemen, I can
          explain every--!
          AS A BURLY OFFICER'S HEAD CONNECTS WITH RICK'S CHEST, we...FREEZE FRAME2..And FADE TO BLACK... and then:SMASH CUT TO:Law & Order MUSIC CUE as we SUPER:TWO WEEKS EARLIERFADE BACK IN:INT. RICK'S FAMILY ROOM - DAYON TV SCREEN - a video shows several YOUNG PEOPLE, early-
          20's, sunning themselves at the beach. A YOUNG-LOOKING RICK
          hams it up for the camera.RICK (O.S.)See the stud in the blue shorts?
          That's me the summer I got out of
          college.LITTLE GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)Wow, Dad, you used to have muscles.
          REVERSE ANGLE reveals EMMA, 6, and GUNNAR, 4, sitting on
          either side of Rick.RICKI still have a few.GUNNARWhere?
          Rick shoots him a look.RICKThey're hidden.
          BACK ON TV SCREEN - A PRETTY GIRL with a knockout body comes
          up and puts her arms around Rick.EMMAWho's that girl?RICKThat's Mommy.EMMANo, I mean the young one standing
          next to you.RICKThat's Mommy.EMMAMommy used to have long hair? And
          she wore a bikini?RICK(WISTFULLY)Yes she did.3.EMMAHow come she doesn't wear a bikini
          anymore?GUNNARIs it because of her fat ass?RICKI guess. What? No. Who said Mommy's
          got a fat ass?GUNNARMommy.LONG BEAT.RICKWell, uh, I don't appreciate that
          language, Gunnar. You've got the
          best mom in the whole world--don't
          ever say anything bad about her.
          Just then, MAGGIE comes GRUNTING into the room carrying a ONE-
          YEAR-OLD BABY in one arm and a basket of laundry in the
          other. She's in her late-30's, cute, with short, manageable
          mommy hair. She's wearing SWEATPANTS, an OVERSIZED T-SHIRT,
          and NO MAKE-UP.RICK (CONT'D)Hey beautiful, you better get a
          move on--we're supposed to be
          meeting Fred and Grace soon.MAGGIEI know, I know, I'm trying.RICKWell how long you gonna be?MAGGIEForty-five minutes--sooner if you
          help with the kids.
          Maggie looks to him, hopeful.RICK(NONCHALANT)Forty-five minutes is good.
          Maggie shoots him a look and Rick smiles.RICK (CONT'D)I'm kidding. Okay, kids, first one
          in the tub gets college paid for.
          Emma and Gunnar just stare at him.RICK (CONT'D)Come on, you bums, let's go!4.As Rick starts to tickle his kids they run out of the room,AND WECUT TO:EXT. SIDEWALK - EVENINGRick and Maggie walk along hand-in-hand. They're dressed-up
          and happy-looking.RICKI miss going out with you on
          Saturday nights.
          She smiles at him.MAGGIEI know, it's just like the old
          days.
          Rick pulls Maggie close as they walk.RICKMaybe we should make a rule that we
          go out at least six nights a week
          without the kids.
          Maggie GIGGLES.RICK (CONT'D)I'm serious. We should go out every
          week--just you and me.
          A BEAUTIFUL BLONDE walks past them and Rick gives a QUICK
          GLANCE back AT HER ASS.RICK (CONT'D)I think it'd be healthy.MAGGIEYou gotta be kidding me?
          Maggie pulls away.RICKWhat?MAGGIEYou just checked out that girl's
          butt.RICKI did?MAGGIEYeah, you did, and it's rude.RICKWhy? You think she saw me?MAGGIEsaw you.5.RICKOh, uh, yeah. I'm sorry, honey, I'm
          just kind of spacey today.GRACE (O.S.)Come on, we're late!
          REVERSE ANGLE reveals Fred Searing and his wife GRACE, 38,
          waiting outside a restaurant. Fred sports a full-head of
          hair that's maybe a little too stiff. Grace is short and
          appealing in a Rachel Ray kind of way. Fred leans in to kiss
          Maggie as Rick kisses Grace.MAGGIEGrace, let me ask you something:
          Does Fred ever check out other
          women in front of you?GRACENo, Fred's not a gawker.
          Grace pats a pleased-looking Fred on the head.GRACE (CONT'D)Come on, Mags, let's go say hi to
          Dr. Lucy.
          We follow the women as they leave their husbands and ENTER
          the restaurant under a banner that says, 'Boston Psychiatric
          Association Person of the Year.'INT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUSGrace and Maggie approach the check-in table.WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)There they are!
          ANOTHER ANGLE reveals DR. LUCY GILBERT, a very attractive and
          sophisticated-looking 40-year-old, holding court in the
          corner.GRACEDr. Lucy! Congratulations!DR. LUCYGirls, thank you so much for
          coming.
          Dr. Lucy speaks with a FRENCH ACCENT.MAGGIEAre you kidding me? You're the only
          friend of ours who ever got an
          award--you think we're going to
          miss that?
          ANGLE ON Rick and Fred standing at the bar.FREDDo you mind telling me how your
          wife catches you checking out
          another girl? What is this, amateur
          hour?6.The BARTENDER delivers a couple beers and Rick pays.RICKThe girl walked past and I glanced
          back at her for like half a second.FREDThere's your problem, dumb-ass--
          it's the wrong order. You don't
          wait for the girl to walk past and
          then glance back. You turn when
          she's still fifteen feet in front
          of you...then you wait for her to
          walk into your line of vision.
          Fred NOTICES an ATTRACTIVE WOMAN walking toward them from the
          right.FRED (CONT'D)Observe.
          Before the woman reaches them, Fred turns to his left and
          holds the look until the Attractive Woman's ASS ENTERS HIS
          VIEW and he watches her walk away.FRED (CONT'D)You see? I can't help it if her
          butt walks where I'm already
          looking.RICK(GETTING IT)It was your air space.WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)Hey, guys.
          They turn to see a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN with a healthy tan walking
          past carrying several drinks. This is MISSY FRANKENFIELD,
          mid-30's.RICK AND FREDHey, Missy.MISSY(CALLING back to them)
          Don't forget to mingle!
          The guys watch Missy walk away.FREDWow. Missy's looking pretty good
          for someone going through a
          divorce.RICKYeah, that's rough stuff--I heard
          they might have to sell the house.FREDToo bad. You gonna hit 'em up for
          the listing?7.RICKWhat am I, a vulture? Nah, I don't
          go after the divorcee business
          unless they approach me first.FREDYeah, it's kind of tacky, huh?
          As the guys crane their necks to get a better view of Missy's
          ass, we...
          REVERSE ANGLE to reveal Maggie, Grace and Dr. Lucy sipping
          lemondrops and watching Rick and Fred from across the room.GRACELook at those two meatheads
          checking out Missy Frankenfield.
          What, do they think they're
          invisible over there?MAGGIEI thought you said Fred wasn't a
          gawker.GRACEHe was standing right next to you.
          I can't let him know that I know--
          that would take all the fun out of
          it.(CHUCKLES)You should see him. He's got some
          stupid move where he looks back
          before the girl passes to make it
          seem like he couldn't help but
          notice her ass. It's pathetic.
          Maggie and Dr. Lucy GIGGLE.CUT TO:EXT. RICK AND MAGGIE'S HOUSE - NIGHTRick's car is parked in the driveway, and he and Maggie are
          getting out.RICKHow about I drive the babysitter
          home while you go upstairs and
          prepare the altar?
          He puts his arm around her as they walk toward the front
          door.MAGGIEI want to, honey, but I've got to
          get up early with the kids.RICKI'll get up with the kids.MAGGIEBut I have to go out and buy a gift-
          -they're going to a birthday party
          tomorrow.8.RICKI'll cjet the gift, then I'll take
          the kids to the park, then to the
          party. You can dust stay in bed,,
          get your beauty sleep, and bask in
          the sweet, sweet pounding I'm about
          to give you.MAGGIEI love it when you sweet-talk me.
          Maggie smiles but as Rick opens the front door they FREEZE INTHEIR TRACKS.THEIR POV - the babysitter (PAIGE, 20, cute) is standing
          there with their 4-year-old, Gunnar.GUNNARMommy! Daddy!RICK(DEFLATED)Little buddy.. .what are you doing
          up?
          Gunnar runs into his mother's arms and Maggie shrugs
          apologetically to Rick.RICK (CONT'D)This is just a minor obstacle.CUT TO:INT. RICK'S MINI-VAN - NIGHTRick is at the wheel of his Dodge Caravan and Paige sits in
          the passenger seat. She is on the busty side.RICKHow were the kids tonight?PAIGEPerfect. That Gunnar is so cute--
          all he wants to do is wrestle with
          me.
          Rick smiles at this.PAIGE (CONT'D)Mr. Mills, would it be okay to turn
          down the air--I'm a little chilly.
          Look--I got goose bumps.
          As she HOLDS OUT HER ARM to show him the GOOSE-BUMPS, we
          RACK FOCUS BEYOND HER ARM to the ERECT NIPPLES that are
          PIERCING THROUGH HER SHEER TOP like small tents.
          BACK ON Rick as his EYES GO WIDE WITH TERROR and he looks
          away.9.RICKOh, uh, sure, I'm sorry.
          Flustered, he moves to the temperature control which in LARGE
          ILLUMINATED DIGITAL TYPE reads: 69!!! He quickly PUNCHES THE
          A/C OFF, then trains his eyes straight ahead and grips the
          steering wheel tight at ten-and-two.PAIGEThank you.RICK'Welcome.EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - NIGHTThe mini-van pulls up in front of a sorority house.INT. RICK'S MINI-VAN - CONTINUOUSPaige hesitates before getting out.PAIGEMr. Mills, can I ask you something?RICKSure.PAIGEI was wondering...(SQUINTS NERVOUSLY).could you buy me some beer?
          Rick looks surprised.RICKBuy you some.. .How old are you?PAIGETwenty. But I'm turning twenty-one
          next week.RICKOh. Happy birthday. That's a
          biggie.PAIGEYeah. My aunt usually buys beer for
          me, but she's out of town.(SMILES HOPEFULLY)So. . .could ya?RICKUh, I don't know, Paige...I could
          get in a lot of trouble for giving
          alcohol to a minor.PAIGEOh, come on, I'm a junior in
          college. You drank when you were in
          college, didn't you?10.RICKWell, uh...PAIGEBesides, it's so arbitrary. How
          does it make sense that twenty's
          old enough to fight in Iraq or
          watch a porno movie, but it's too
          young to drink a beer?
          Rick shifts in his seat.RICKReally? Twenty's old enough to
          uh...?PAIGEFight in Iraq?RICKNo, the other thing.PAIGEWatch Porn? Oh, God yeah--half the
          girls in those things are my age.
          Rick catches a hint of cleavage, a flash of leg.PAIGE (CONT'D)Look, I promise no one's gonna find
          out. If you want, you can join me
          down at the lake--we'll listen to
          some tunes and have a couple beers.
          Rick stares at her, pictures it in his head. She looks
          hopeful, open.RICKI'm sorry, Paige, I can't do that.PAIGEWhy not?RICKWell... it would be.. .inappropriate.
          Rick's voice has taken on a firmer, more adult tone. Paige
          seems amused by it.PAIGEWhat, is that your grown-up voice?(SMILES)That would be inappropriate, Paige.COME ON--RICKNo, Paige.
          (with an edge)
          What are you thinking? I'm a
          married man and I have a family.
          You think they'd like it if they
          knew I was hanging out at the lake,
          all alone, drinking beer with a
          college girl?11.She seems taken aback.PAIGE(PUT-OFF)I never said alone. My sorority's
          having a party down there tonight.
          Rick CLEARS HIS THROAT, tries to hide his embarrassment.RICKAll right, better get inside.
          She opens the car door, then glares back at him.PAIGEEwww. What the hell were you
          thinking?RICKGo ahead. Scoot along now.
          As she SLAMS the car door, we...CUT TO:INT. RICK AND MAGGIE'S HOUSE - NIGHTRick bounds up the stairs to find Maggie gently closing
          Gunnar's bedroom door.MAGGIEShhhh. He just fell asleep.RICKAwesome.
          Rick playfully pinches Maggie's butt as he follows her into
          their bedroom where...INT. BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS.They find Emma sitting up in their bed, smiling.EMMACan I sleep with you tonight?RICKNo.EMMAPlease.RICKNo. Absolutely not.
          Maggie, clearly softening to the idea, shrugs at Rick.12.RICK (CONT'D)Are you serious? Look, besides the
          other thing, I don't like the fact
          that my daughter needs someone to
          sleep with every night--that's not
          going to be good when she goes off
          to college, you know.
          Maggie rolls her eyes.EMMAWell.. .can someone read me a story?
          Rick looks at Maggie, then at his daughter.RICKOkay, one quick story. Come on,
          jump on my back.
          Emma jumps on Rick's back.RICK (CONT'D)(TO MAGGIE)You can get started without me--
          I'll be right back.
          Rick piggybacks Emma out of the room.INT. EMMA'S BEDROOM - MINUTES LATEREmma is putting Rick's HAIR INTO PONYTAILS.RICKOkay, honey, this is the last pony
          and then night-night.
          Emma finishes putting on a rubberband, then looks at him,
          satisfied.EMMAThere. You look pretty, Daddy.RICKOkay, now give me a kiss, hug and
          go to sleep.
          She lays back on her pillow. Rick gives her a big kiss on
          both cheeks.RICK (CONT'D)I love you, Emma.EMMAI love you, too, Daddy.EXT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATERRick (still in ponytails) tip-toes out of Emma's bedroom,
          closes the door so tly, then HUSTLES DOWN THE HALLWAY.FINT. RICK & MAGGIE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUSRick scrambles into the room and STOPS IN HIS TRACKS.13.HIS POV - Maggie lays in bed, FAST ASLEEP.RICKNo. Please, no.
          Rick wants to wake her up but sees that she needs the sleep,
          so he just PULLS THE COVERS OVER HER SHOULDERS.
          As Rick walks around the bed and INTO THE BATHROOM in the
          b.g., we HOLD ON MAGGIE until she OPENS HER EYES. She
          listens to her husband brush his teeth with perhaps a tinge
          of GUILT, and when he shuts off the faucet, she CLOSES HER
          EYES AGAIN, and we...CUT TO:EXT. PARK - MORNINGRick pushes Gunnar and Emma on the swings as a sweaty Fred
          APPROACHES carrying a tennis racket. (We see several TENNIS
          COURTS in the b.g.)FREDHey.RICKHey. How'd you make out?FREDGreat. Lost both sets.RICKSo'd you get the business?
          Fred nods and wipes his brow.FREDPretty sure I got the Auto and
          Home. He told me to call his
          accountant on Monday about the
          Life.RICKNice.
          Fred looks around at all the pretty MOMS and NANNIES with
          their CHILDREN.FREDCan you believe the talent here
          today?RICK(PAINED)Yeah. I know.
          They NOTICE something O.S..
          THEIR POV - we see a SCANDINAVIAN AU PAIR bent over EXPOSING
          HER THONG UNDERWEAR as she picks up a CHILD from a wagon.FREDOuch.14.Rick SIGHS.RICKCPR girl's back, too.
          Rick nods toward A PIG-TAILED PARAMEDIC, early 30's, TEACHING
          A CPR CLASS. The two men look on solemnly.FREDImagine if we were coming here back
          when we were single?RICK(FALSE BRAVADO)Oh baby, the damage we would do.EMMAMonkey bars!
          The kids JUMP off the swings and RUN for the jungle gym.GUNNARMe first!
          Rick trails them like a Sherpa carrying a couple Razor
          scooters and a basketball as Fred tags along. They shlep
          past THE TRI-DELTA SORORITY playing ultimate frisbee andWEARING 'JUICY' SWEATS.FREDSo you get lucky last night?RICKNah, the kids were up when we got
          home. How 'bout you?FREDWell, kinda lucky. Grace conked
          right out so I snuck out to the car
          and rubbed one out.
          Rick shoots Fred a look.RICKThe car? What are you Knight Rider?
          Why didn't you just go in the
          bathroom like a normal guy?FREDAnd get caught by Grace? Can't risk
          it. Besides, cars turn me on--it's
          where I lost my virginity. And
          they're comfy--I just put the seat
          back and turn on the tunes.
          The guys sit on a bench.RICKThat's one of the things they don't
          tell you when you're young--that
          you'll still be jerking-off after
          you get married. I thought it was
          dust gonna be a teenage thing.15FREDYeah, I didn't see that one coming.
          The two men sit in silence for a LONG BEAT as the Frisbee
          Girls play all around them.FRED (CONT'D)You know what I miss the most?RICKWhat?FREDThe arch.RICKWhat arch?FREDYou know when you're taking a
          girl's panties off for the first
          time, and you're wondering if she's
          going to stop you, but then she
          gives you that little pelvic arch-
          thrust that tells you that the
          struggle's over, everything's going
          to be okay?
          Rick SIGHS.RICKThat's a happy moment.FREDYep. Another thing gone forever.
          Rick looks at his watch.RICKI should get going, I have to drop
          the kids off at a birthday party.FREDYou want to grab a coffee after?CUT TO:ESTABLISHING SHOT - COFFEE SHOP - LATER THAT MORNINGINT. COFFEE SHOP - SAMEFred and Rick stand in line.RICKDo you have any interest in going
          down to the Patriot's training camp
          one of these days?FREDAre you kidding, I'd love that.
          Except...I always feel kind of
          pathetic waiting in line for Tom
          Brady's autograph.16.RICKFred, I was planning on bringing
          the kids.FREDGenius! That's the perfect cover!
          Rick shoots him a look then REACTS to something O.S.RICKUh-oh...
          HIS POV - SLO-MO of a BEAUTIFUL GIRL walking toward him. Her
          straight brown hair shimmers.. .her blue eyes twinkle.. .her
          white uniformed blouse is unbuttoned enough to reveal a
          tasteful amount of CLEAVAGE. This is COFFEE GIRL, 23,
          granola, fresh, Australian, spacey.
          BACK ON THE GUYS staring in awe.FREDDid you see her face? Her face is
          tremendous.RICK(chanting, scared)

          The thing that you're all so

          Grace and Maggie find out we can't
          get laid on our own, they'll start
          thinking we need them to get laid.
          Do you know what that'll do to the
          balance of power in our homes?
          It'll destroy it!
          Rick thinks about this and grows alarmed.RICKWell, what if we just tell them
          that we did hook up?FREDWe can't. Grace'll know. She always
          knows when I'm lying.RICKHey, what about a massage parlor?FREDNo! That's giving up.
          Fred glares at him.FRED (CONT'D)You don't get it, do you? A hall
          pass ain't all about sex. It's
          about being man enough to pick up a
          woman even though you may not be
          what--in the traditional sense--is
          considered...

          something positive can come from
          having a hall pass, then the whole
          concept is dead. Not just for

          for my work-out appointment.
          When Rick hops out of his car, we see that he's wearing gym
          shorts and an old Springsteen t-shirt. He hesitates, then
          grabs a SWEATSHIRT out of the car and TIES IT AROUND HIS
          WAIST. Rick hurries down the sidewalk toward Leigh.RICK (CONT'D)Hey, girl!LEIGH(SMILING)All right! You decided to go for
          it.
          As Rick follows Leigh into the gym, a smiling Flats CALLSOUT:FLATSHey, Rick! Good luck with the
          fishing!
          As Flats begins to LAUGH, a sheepish Rick scurries into the

          brewski after your work-out?LEIGHNah.
          Rick looks disappointed.LEIGH (CONT'D)I'm gonna grab two.
          Leigh flashes him a smile and as she walks away, she gives
          him the peace sign. He returns it.RICKPeace it!
          As soon as he hears himself, Rick cringes.CUT TO:CLOSE ON RICK'S FACE - he's wearing the headphones and has

          sink. While he washes his hands, a young, NAKED, METROSEXUAL-
          TYPE whips his leg into the sink beside him. Rick slowly
          turns to look.
          RICK'S POV - as the Metrosexual talks to ANOTHER NAKED MAN,
          he fills his hand with SHAVING CREAM and the hand DISAPPEARS
          BETWEEN HIS OWN LEGS. The guys continue their conversation,
          unfazed. Then the Metrosexual starts to SHAVE HIS BALLS.
          As Rick dries his hands, he can't contain himself.RICKWhat's that about--you swimming the
          English Channel?
          The Metrosexual shoots Rick an annoyed look.METROSEXUALNah, Just not into looking like the
          knuckle-dragging guy on the

          eases into the STEAMING WATER. He hits a button and the jets
          kick on FULL BLAST, turning the hot tub into a BUBBLYCAULDRON.77.RICKOh...yes.
          He bunches up his towel and puts it behind his head, then
          settles in and CLOSES HIS EYES.DISSOLVE TO:SAME SCENE - LATERRick is in a DEEP SLEEP. His mouth is wide open but his head
          is BARELY ABOVE WATER as he SNORES LOUDLY. He dips beneath
          the surface and as he begins to CHOKE and COUGH, he wakes up.
          Rick takes a moment to get his bearings, then STRUGGLES to
          get out of the hot tub. But his MUSCLES HAVE TURNED TO JELLY.RICK(WEAKLY)Little help...
          When none comes, a life-and-death STRUGGLE ensues as the
          flabby, middle-aged dad tries to climb to safety.RICK (CONT'D)Help ...me...
          Just as Rick starts to go under, the two young naked
          metrosexuals hear his MOANS and come to his rescue. They
          jump in the hot tub and heave him ashore. As Rick GASPS for
          air, one of the metrosexuals kneels down and lifts Rick's
          head onto his NAKED LAP.NAKED METROSEXUAL #1Are you having chest pains, sir?RICK(WINDED)No, no, I think I was...in the hot
          tub too long. I can't feel my body.NAKED METROSEXUAL #2How long were you in there?RICKWhat time is it?NAKED METROSEXUAL #2Seven-thirty.RICKAbout three hours.
          That's when Rick realizes that his head is RESTING ON THE
          GUY'S COCK. He tries to roll off him, but Metrosexual #1HOLDS HIM TIGHT.NAKED METROSEXUAL #1Try not to move, sir.RICKI'm okay, just help me up.78.NAKED METROSEXUAL #1(TO METROSEXUAL #2)All right, give him a hand.
          Metrosexual #2 straddles Rick's chest and leans down to pull
          him up. As Rick starts to rise, HIS FACE COMES PERILOUSLY
          CLOSE TO THE SECOND MAN'S O.S. DANGLING COCK and Rick has toTURN HIS HEAD TO AVOID CONTACT.They finally get Rick to his feet. As the naked men help him
          across the room, we

          Rick's HIRSUTE BUTT.RICKOkay, thanks, guys. I can take it
          from here.

          the champagne. Rick fumbles through his pocket and finally
          pays. Then he's left alone with Paige and her coed-in-love-
          with-the-professor eyes and her suddenly heaving cleavage.RICKYeah. Um...I have to go, Paige, but
          it was great seeing you.

          Leigh is amused by this, but she tries to hide it from the

          into Baker and Hog-Head standing around a keg with a GROUP OFGUYS.RICKHey. . .what are you guys doing here?HOG-HEADWe're here for the hall pass.RICKReally? I thought you guys had
          given up on us?BAKERWe did. We're here with them.
          He nods toward RICK LEARY and WILLY BOSHANE, both early 40's
          and paunchy.RICKWhat are you talking about?104.BAKERWhen Leary and Boshane heard about
          your guy's hall pass, they
          convinced their wives to give them
          one, too.
          A smiling Leary tries to HIGH-FIVE Rick, but he's having none
          of it. He turns to Baker, livid.RICKYou weren't supposed to tell anyone
          about the hall pass!LEARYThey didn't say anything. Our wives
          heard about it at the pool.RICKNo! At the pool?!
          Rick rubs his face, distressed.BOSHANEYep. And then about three days ago--
          after some hard-core negotiating--
          we managed to push the bill
          through.
          The guys LAUGH. Rick can hardly believe what he's spawned.RICKReally? So...how's it going?BOSHANESolid. Very solid.LEARYWe're building mucho momentumo.
          Baker makes a JERK-OFF MOTION.LEARY (CONT'D)(ANNOYED)Hey, Baker, a hall pass ain't just
          about sex, you know.BOSHANEThat's right. It's about going
          bowling and, uh, staying up late,
          and being able to do what you want
          to do when you want to do it.RICKHaven't gotten laid yet, huh?BOSHANE(DISPIRITED)It's a lot tougher than we thought
          it would be.
          Just then Gary comes around a corner.105.GARYHey, dudes, there's like ten very
          bangable chicks out on the back
          deck--let's go!
          Leary HOLDS UP HIS BEER.LEARYTo freedom!
          The guys TAP their beer cups, then EXIT toward the back deck.
          A dejected and defeated Rick watches them go, then turns and
          pushes his way through the crowd to the front door. As he
          OPENS THE DOOR to leave, he finds himself FACE-TO-FACE WITHLEIGH.LEIGHHey, where are you going?RICKWhat are you doing...? I thought
          you'd left.LEIGHNo. I told you, I just had to talk
          him off the ledge. I calmed him
          down and sent him on his way.RICKOh. Uh, great.LEIGHSo where's that game room? I
          thought we were gonna play some
          games.
          She smiles and takes his hand and as they walk away, we go...INT. COAKLEY'S HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHTRick and Leigh walk down the hall to the game room. He opens
          the door and flips on the light.
          THEIR POV - there's a pool table, a few pinball machines, a
          bar, and a bed.LEIGHI'll be right back--I just have to
          use the bathroom.
          Rick nods, then watches as Leigh walks off and disappears
          into the bathroom. He takes a DEEP BREATH. This is it.
          Just then he hears O.S. LAUGHTER. Rick heads down the
          hallway and pushes open a door.COAKLEY (O.S.)Hey.
          REVERSE ANGLE reveals Coakley SITTING ALL ALONE in a small
          study off the hall. He has a bowl of Cap'n Crunch on his lap
          and is watching a re-run of The Andy Griffith Show.106.RICKHey. How come you're not downstairs
          partying?
          Coakley gives him a sad, worn-out smile.COAKLEYAll partied out, pal.
          Rick nods, understanding. Coakley LAUGHS once again at theTV.COAKLEY (CONT'D)Man, that Barney Fife still kills
          me.
          He looks back to Rick.COAKLEY (CONT'D)Hey, I was thinking about this hall-
          pass business. It's really ironic,
          isn't it?
          Rick glances down the hall to see if Leigh has returned.RICKHow's that?COAKLEYWell think about it. There's two
          kinds of guys who cheat on their
          wives: The guy who does it behind
          her back, and a guy like you who
          has his wife's permission.RICKWell it's not really cheating if I
          have permission.COAKLEYYeah, whatever. The point is, if
          you asked a hundred people who the
          better CJuy is, ninety-nine of 'em
          would pick you, because you're
          being honest--there's no deceit
          involved.
          Rick is growing uncomfortable.COAKLEY (CONT'D)But the funny thing is, the other
          guy, the cheater, the bad guy, he
          has to live with all that guilt and
          anxiety, while his wife's running
          around happy as a clam because she
          doesn't know anything. And you, the
          good guy, you've got no guilt at
          all because you just laid it all on
          your wife's shoulders.RICKWell I didn't really think of itLIKE--107.COAKLEYIt's like she's your guilt Sherpa!
          Coakley CHUCKLES and Rick deflates.COAKLEY (CONT'D)Funny, huh?RICK(WEAKLY)Yeah.COAKLEYAnd that, my friend, is why you are
          a genius.
          As Rick lets this all sink in, weCUT TO:INT. RICK & FRED'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHTPaige's Aunt Meg is sitting on the couch. Her legs are
          crossed revealing a lot of skin. Fred hands her a glass of
          wine and sits beside her.FREDCheers.
          They CLINK glasses.AUNT MEGRick, I hope you don't mind me
          tracking you down--Paige told me
          where you were staying.FREDPlease. Not at all.AUNT MEGYou've been very sweet to her.
          Fred waves her off.FREDHey, she's a good kid. I do what I
          can for the kids.
          Aunt Meg moves in a little closer, squints at him sweetly.AUNT MEGShe told me everything. And I have
          to say, I was very impressed.FREDHm?AUNT MEGI know she tried to hook-up with
          you--twice in fact--and that you
          set her straight both times.
          Fred hadn't heard this from Rick and is a little confused.108.FREDUh...hook-up?AUNT MEG(SMILES)Rick, enough with the chivalry.
          Paige wanted to sleep with you and
          you didn't take advantage of her.
          I'm just saying that's very cool.
          He shrugs modestly.FREDWell... she's a kid and kids get
          crushes. I remember in tenth grade
          I had the biggest crush on my
          French teacher--thank God Mr.
          LeClaire was professional enough to
          only date seniors.
          Meg GIGGLES.AUNT MEGI'm serious, it takes a certain
          kind of guy to say no to a
          beautiful young girl like that--
          especially since you have your
          wi e's permission now.
          Meg shoots him a knowing smile and puts her glass down.AUNT MEG (CONT'D)I like that, Rick. You have morals.
          She leans in and KISSES HIS NECK. Fred glances down at her
          breasts.FREDHey, all you have in this world is
          your word.
          As Aunt Meg CLIMBS ON TOP OF FRED, weCUT TO:INT. COAKLEY'S HOUSE - GAME ROOM - NIGHTRick ENTERS to find Leigh playing a pinball machine. Leigh
          turns and smiles at Rick.RICKLeigh, I gotta split.LEIGHWhat?RICK(NERVOUS)Yeah, I kind of hit a wall.
          She can hardly believe her ears.109.LEIGHReally? Are you feeling okay?
          You're not mad because I went
          outside with my friend, are you?RICKNo, no, no. Look, I shouldn't be
          doing this. I have.. .you know,
          commitments.
          Leigh nods at this, then unties a shoulder strap and her
          DRESS FALLS TO THE FLOOR. Suddenly she's NAKED before him
          and she's PERFECT.RICK (CONT'D)(WEAKLY)Um, you dropped something.
          For a moment nobody moves. We can almost hear Rick's heart
          beat. Then Leigh STEPS CLOSER to him and Rick instinctively
          leans back.LEIGHRelax. Don't think so much. You're
          gonna have your wife for the rest
          of your life, but tonight. . .you
          have me.
          Leigh smiles. And it's the kind of smile you only get two or
          three times in your life, if you're lucky, and probably never
          from a woman this beautiful.
          She reaches down and UNBUCKLES HIS PANTS, then she PULLS OFF
          HIS SHIRT. They stand face-to-face now, the middle-aged guy
          and the young beauty, and it's happening exactly the way Rick
          had hoped it would, the dream.
          She presses her body against his and STARTS TO KISS HIS NECK,
          her hand DISAPPEARING SOMEWHERE BELOW HIS WAIST. Then she
          leans her head AGAINST HIS CHEST. As he looks down at her,
          we PUSH IN on a suddenly conflicted Rick.RICKNope. I can't do this.
          He reaches for his shirt.LEIGHWhat are you doing?RICKI'm sorry.
          She stares at him, confused, as he buckles his pants.LEIGHYour wife didn't give you a hallway
          permission slip, did she?110.RICKYes, she did, but... look, you're
          insanely beautiful and
          pathologically sexy and every cell
          in my body is telling me to dust do
          this, but--
          Rick points to his chest.RICK (CONT'D)See this area, this spot right
          here? The first time Maggie and I
          slept together, back in college,
          she fell asleep right here. And she
          left a puddle of drool. And it
          didn't bother me. It actually felt
          good. That's when I knew I was
          going to marry her.(BEAT)And when my kids--Emma and Gunnar--
          when they were babies, this is
          where they slept. Or sometimes at
          four o'clock in the morning Emma
          would just lay there and stare up
          at me. It was where we first got to
          know each other.(BEAT)So I'm sorry, Leigh, but as amazing
          as I think you are...I gotta go
          home.
          Rick shrugs apologetically.LEIGHWell, I think you have a screw
          loose and you're probably going to
          regret this for the rest of your
          life, but. . .right on, man.RICKUm...do you want me to give you a
          ride home?LEIGHNo. It's only one-thirty--I'm going
          back down to the party.

          pants still at his ankles), Fred WADDLING LIKE A PENGUIN.AUNT MEGMoral-guy's a tit-man, huh?FRED(SHRUGGING)Well, I grew up in the midwest.
          She pushes him down on the bed and Fred quickly kicks off his
          pants and shoes (but keeps his boxers on.) Meg TACKLES him
          and the two of them start to roll around UNDER THE COVERS.

          and I'm gonna go home and take care
          of mine.
          Fred nods, emotional, as the cops look at each other,
          unmoved. Rick starts to walk away.FREDRick...
          Rick stops and turns at the door.FRED (CONT'D)You go love that lady!
          The Burly Officer rolls his eyes and steps up to Rick.BURLY OFFICERUh, before you 'go love that lady',

          of wine and two half-filled glasses on the coffee table.

          Maggie thinks about this.MAGGIEWhat are you talking about? We were
          dating then.
          Rick nods. She looks at him, not sure if she understands.RICKYou were my first. And you were my
          last. And you were everything in
          between.

          van pulls up and Fred gets out. (Fred has a BLACK EYE.) He
           helps Grace out of the van, then pays the DRIVER. (Grace has
          TWO BLACK EYES and her nose is HEAVILY BANDAGED.) When the
          taxi drives off, Fred helps Grace toward the house.FRED.And what were you doing driving
          around at one o'clock in the
          morning?GRACE(NERVOUS)Well...I was upset so I went for a
          drive--you know, to think--and I
          must have hit a patch of sand, and
          before I knew it I was into the
          pole.
          Fred stops and looks her in the eye.FREDI'm sorry, Grace.GRACEFor what?FREDFor putting you through all this.
          Grace looks awash in guilt.GRACEIt's not your fault, Fred.FREDYes, it is--of course it's my
          fault. This isn't you--driving
          around all night, thinking--you're
          not a thinker.
          When she looks up at him, he forces a smile. But she doesn't
          smile back.GRACELook, Fred, we have to talk
          about... about what happened this
          week.
          Fred takes a DEEP BREATH and looks around, trying to avoid
          the moment.121.FREDGrace. . .do we really have to do
          this?
          Grace lowers her head guiltily.GRACEYeah. Yeah, we do.

          were talking about Rick.
          Grace looks at him, confused. Suddenly Fred falls to his
          knees.FRED (CONT'D)Look, all you gotta know is that
          whatever happened doesn't matter! I
          love you and only you! And I'm

          sweetie... can we please just never
          talk about what happened this week?
          Grace's eyes flicker about, hardly believing her luck.GRACEUm...deal.
          Fred gets up and THROWS HIS ARMS AROUND HIS WIFE.GRACE (CONT'D)I love you, Fred.
          As they embrace, Fred sees Rick come out the front door with
          his arm around Maggie. Fred shoots Rick a THUMBS-UP.
          CLOSE ON RICK AND MAGGIE as they smile at Fred and Grace.RICKCome on, you two! We're gonna go
