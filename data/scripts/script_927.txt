                                   Vince McKewinSECOND DRAFTFebruary 19,1999FADE IN:EXT. MARINA DEL REY - DAYIt's raining lightly in the harbor and the
       water around the moored boats looks dirty and
       cold.

       We PICK UP a sad excuse for a boat sitting in
       an end slip.

       It's a sea-gull-shitcovered, thirtyfoot cabin
       cruiser that hasn't cruised in a long, long
       time. A ratty looking unpainted plywood
       addition has been nailed to the top of the
       cabin. It's partially covered with a blue
       plastic tarp.SUPERIMPOSE:   MARINA DEL REY, CALIFORNIA -FALLThe tarp moves and SHANE FALCO's half-naked
       torso emerges from under it. Shane is late
       twenties, golden boy handsome, but quickly
       going to seed. He looks hung over.

       Shane glances up at the sky and rain. He
       pulls on the top part of an old patched wet
       suit and zips it up. He shivers.EXT. MARINA DEL REY HARBOR - DAYWe're BUZZING around the harbor with Shane in
an old Zodiac inflatable DINGHY.

Shane has pulled up the attached rubber hood
to his wet suit so that only the white, pasty
oblong of his face is visible.

It's still raining as he steers the little
boat around the sailboats and yachts.

He pulls up to a fiftyfoot sailboat and CUTS
the ENGINE.

With practiced moves, he ties the dinghy to
the rear rail of the sailboat and clips a
bill for services rendered on the sailboat's
stern line.

He slips on a weight belt,    puts on a pair of
old gaffer taped goggles,    jams the end of a
air-hose in his mouth, and    falls backward out
of the dinghy and into the    water.EXT. UNDERWATER - DAYIt's dark, dirty and murky. Suddenly, Shane
floats INTO FRAME and comes AT us with a long
spatula.ANOTHER ANGLEHe attacks the underside of the sailboat
which is covered with green algae muck that
hangs a foot off the bottom of the boat.

The spatula scrapes away the green mess
revealing the pure white underside of the
boat.CLOSE ON SHANEAs he scrapes. Muck from the boat floats
past him. This doesn't look like fun.

As he works, he happens to look down and
notices something on the bottom.SHANE'S POVAmidst the beer cans and other trash,
something golden is sitting on the bottom.BACK TO SCENEShane takes a deep pull on his hose, lets it
go and drifts down.

A shaft of sunlight penetrates the murky
water and reveals a broken trophy half-buried
in the mud. Shane kneels over it and picks
it up.

The trophy is almost a full-size football
rendered in bronze attached to a broken base.

Shane turns "the ball" over in his hands. He
grips the seams like he's done this before.

Then he holds the football out in front of
him.

Suddenly, he starts barking garbled signals
to an imaginary offense. He turns to his
running back as he yells something like "Blue
31!" It comes out in bubbles

He cocks his left leg and his wide receiver
goes in motion.

Then on the "snap" he turns and starts a five
step drop.

He moves in slow motion because hey... he's
underwater! He executes a perfect play
action fake on the third step of his drop,
and looks "down field" for his receivers.

But there's a blitz! He steps up in the
pocket but a linebacker's arm almost takes
his head off. He dodges, he bobs, he weaves
in a kind of delicate ballet.

He rolls left and keeps looking for the open
man.

Suddenly he points down field, pulls up and
cocks his arm.

The "ball" comes behind his ear and snaps
forward in a perfect release.The trophy spins OUT OF FRAME but we HOLD ON
      Shane as he watches his pass. Suddenly, he
      throws both arms up in a touchdown signal.

      We STAY ON him as he freezes in this pose of
      victory, fifteen feet underwater, on the
      trash-covered, muddy bottom of Marina Del
      Rey.CUT TO:EXT. EDWARD FRANCIS O'NEIL STADIUM (WASHINGTON,D.C.) -DAYBam! A Miami Dolphin linebacker crushes a
      Washington Redskin running back and lands on
      his throat, elbow first.

      It's a beautiful fall day in November and
      Miami is beating the Skins in front of
      seventy-six thousand crazed Washington fans.
      The Redskins are at their home stadium better
      known as "The Big O."INT. CONTROL BOOTH - DAYJOHN MADDEN and PAT SUMMERALL are calling the
      game in shirtsleeves.SUMMERALLThat play, my friends,
                sums up the Redskins'
                running game all day
                long. Now Washington
                calls their last time
                out.

      Madden leans over to do his diagram that
      shows up on your TV screen. We STAY ON him
      as he draws and explains.MADDENHey, the Dolphins do
                this as good as
                anybody. See, in a
                four, three, two, two,
                you got the guards...
                boom!... Plugging up
                the middle, then the
                corners... boom andboom!     Are free to
         box...    leaving the
         middle    linebacker to
         cut off    the trap
         here...    boom!SUMMERALLThird and twenty-two,
         but forget the first
         down with eight seconds
         showing and the Skins
         down by a touchdown.MADDENCould be the last play.SUMMERALLCould be the last play
         of the season if the
         players go out.EXT. SIDELINES - DAYRedskin quarterback EDDIE MARTEL is
conferring with Redskin head coach BUD TILDON
near the bench. Madden and Summerall
continue OVER.MADDEN (V.O.)Take it all in, people.
         This could be it for2,000.We MOVE TO veteran Redskin center REESE
EVANS, 38, standing on the sidelines, uniform
totally clean.

He looks near tears.SUMMERALL(V.O.)Once again, if you
         haven't heard, it was
         announced during
         halftime that the
         N.F.L. Players
         Association will hold a
         press conference
         immediately following
         this game -- that would
         make it about five
         o'clock Eastern time --
         and it is expected thatthe players' union will
            announce a strike
            effective immediately.ON REDSKINETTESTwelve striking-looking women dressed in
burgundy and gold are doing some inane
chatter to a section of fans that ignore
them.

The girls are led by pretty ANNABELLE
FARRELL, a bundle of manic energy inside a
body from heaven.MADDEN (V.O.)It's all about money,
            folks. More money, of
            course and ain't it
            always? The shame of
            it is the big losers
            are you out there, the
            fans.ON MARTELThe Redskin quarterback moves to the huddle.SUMMERALL(V.O.)Here we go: Third
            down, eight seconds to
            play, ball on the
            Dolphins' thirty-three
            yard line. Skins down
            by a touchdown.

The huddle breaks and Martel sets up over the
center.MARTELGreen 48! Green 48!
            Hut! Hut!

The ball is snapped and Martel drops back.
He looks for a receiver and doesn't see
anybody.

He steps up in the pocket, sees an opening
and takes off running down field.MADDEN (V.O.)There goes Martel!

Martel is a pretty good broken field runner
for a big guy. Plus with the defense
covering every possible receiver, he's got a
lot of daylight.

Nobody has touched him as he crosses the
fifteen. Suddenly, a safety, smaller than
Martel, looms in front of him at the ten.

Martel goes down in one of those wimpy
quarterback slides before the safety can even
hit him.

BANG!   The GUN sounds and the game is over.ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALLThey look at each other in disbeliefSUMMERALLWell... Martel goes
          down ten yards short of
          a score.MADDENOn maybe the last play
          of the season.SUMMERALLI think he might have
          slipped.MADDENYeah, there's a lot of
          that going around.ON THREE REDSKIN FANSWe'll see these guys throughout. They're
typical low level Washington bureaucrats
named TODD, ROD and BOB who live for the Hogs
-- the traditional name for the Redskin
offensive linemen.

Todd is shirtless and his entire upper body
is painted Redskin red.

At that moment, they are livid with their
quarterback and Bob is speaking for them all.BOBWe're    coming to your
         house    tonight, and
         we're    gonna fucking
         kill    you! And if you
         got a    dog, we're gonna
         kill    your fucking dog
         too!ON ANNABELLEBehind her, the rest of the cheerleaders are
already walking away. Annabelle looks at
Quarterback Martel with pure disgust as he
walks off the field.CUT TO:INT. LARGE BEDROOM - DAYThe room's blinds are pulled tightly against
the bright sunlight. Only the blue light of
a TV illuminates anything.

Suddenly, we hear an old man in the bed give
out with a loud piercing wail.

The door to the room bangs open and an
English male nurse named AUGUSTINE RIPLEY,
dressed in white, comes running in. He's
carrying a syringe in each hand, poised at
the ready.

He runs to the bed of    the still wailing
EDWARD FRANCIS O'NEIL    (75). O'Neil is hooked
up to an oxygen tank,    watching the just
completed Redskin game    with the sound off.AUGUSTINEDid they win or lose?!

O'Neil continues to wail.AUGUSTINEThat has the distinct
         tonal quality of a
         loss.

He puts one needle down and jabs O'Neil with
the other one.

He murmurs to the old man as he injects him.AUGUSTINENice medicine for a
         loss. Keeps us calm.
         Makes us not so sad.
         Keeps us on an even
         keel. Gives us some
         perspective, doesn't
         it? And we'll save the
         winning medicine for
         next Sunday, won't we?

He finishes.O'NEILIf you keep talking to
         me like I'm a five-
         year-old, I'm going to
         hurt you.AUGUSTINESounds exciting.

He reaches for the phone and hits the speed
dial.AUGUSTINEWe'll want to talk to
         coach now, won't we?

He hands the phone to O'Neil.O'NEIL(on the phone)
         What the fuck was
         that?!INTERCUT WITH:INT. TILDON'S OFFICECoach Tildon sitting in his office. We can
hear players getting dressed, listening to
MUSIC and getting SHOWERS outside his open
door.TILDON(on the phone)
         I think he slipped.O'NEILBullshit he slipped!
         He could have scored!Anybody could have
         scored! I got one foot
         in the god damn grave
         and I could have
         scored!TILDONMister O'Neil, let's
         face facts: The
         players are going out.
         It's gonna happen. And
         nobody wants to get
         hurt on the last play
         before a strike that
         could go on for the
         rest of the season.O'NEILYou god damn wimp!
         You're fired! Get out!
         Get out! Get out!

O'Neil throws the phone down. Augustine
picks it up and then cranks up the oxygen a
notch.

O'Neil takes big gulps of the rich air.AUGUSTINEBetter? It always
         makes you feel better
         when you fire someone,
         we know it does, don't
         we? Yes...O'NEILGet me Jimmy McGinty.
         Get him here. Tonight.

O'Neil sucks hard on the oxygen.CUT TO:INT. REDSKINS LOCKER ROOM - DAYA REPORTER is interviewing WILSON JONES, the
huge defensive end for the Redskins. Wilson
wears an enormous diamond earring.

Wilson is dressing at his locker.WILSONHey, man, I do what myunion says.REPORTERBut you're already one
         of the highest paid
         players in the game.
         The fans just don't see

Wilson holds his arms out.   Yes, he's
gigantic.WILSONThere are some days
         when I am so beat up,
         that I cannot dress my

         management for a valet
         or some shit to help me
         dress and they said no
         way. So, fuck 'em!PLAYER (O.S.)Shut up everybody, here
         it is...

Somebody turns UP a TV in the locker room.ON TVA handsome ex-player named Jerome Lindell
steps up to a podium at a press conference.
He's wearing a two thousand dollar suit.

On the TV he is identified with a super:

"JEROME LINDELL -- President -- National
Football League Players' Association."LINDELL (V.O.)I have just left a
         meeting with
         representatives of the
         owners and I am sad to
         say that they have
         refused the players'
         final demands whichcenter around a rise in
         the current salary cap.(MORE)LINDELL (V.O.) (CONT'D)Therefore, I am
         recommending that all
         N.F.L. players walk out
         and not play until our
         demands are met. I
         want the players to
         walk out tall, to walk
         out righteous, to walk
         out in the knowledge
         that we do this as a
         team. We shall
         overcome the fat cats.
         I send peace to my
         union brothers.

The entire locker room is silent for a beat.
And then everyone starts getting dressed
again, maybe a little slower than before.ON WILSON JONESWILSONShit, I'm goin' to
         Vegas.CUT TO:INT. O'NEIL'S BEDROOM - CLOSE ON O'NEIL - NIGHTAs he sleeps peacefully.    The only sound is
the HISS of his OXYGEN.

Then we hear ICE CUBES SLOSHING in a glass.

O'Neil opens his eyes and sees:

JIMMY McGINTY, a handsome devil in his late
sixties, wearing golf clothes and sipping the
last dregs of a Scotch rocks.

                 McGINTY
         You look like shit.O'NEILI'm dying, Jimmy.

                  McGINTYYou been dying for
         twenty years.

O'Neil motions to the glass. Jimmy pours
three fingers from a Glenlivet bottle and
hands it to him.

                 McGINTY
         That poof of a nurse of
         yours is gonna kick my
         ass if he catches you
         drinking.

O'Neil removes his oxygen to sip his whiskey.
He smiles as it goes down.O'NEILGimme a butt.

                   McGINTY
         I quit.O'NEILNo.

McGinty nods.O'NEILYou pussy. I want you
         to come back as head
         coach. I fired that
         asshole Tilden today.

                 McGINTY
         I'm retired. And
         besides, you don't have

         home in their jets to
         their castles.O'NEILWe're gonna finish the
         season anyway. All of
         us owners decided.
         We're gonna use

         Jimmy. We got a great
         opportunity here! We

         team on the field that

his two main coaches give him a presentation.
They are offensive coordinator LEO
PILACHOWSKI and defensive coordinatorCHRISTOPHER BANES.PILACHOWSKI... Six phone lines
         with internet access on
         two: One for defense
         and one for offense.BANESWe thought we would
         skip special teams for
         the moment.PILACHOWSKIExcept for a kicker.
         We definitely need a
         kicker. A place kicker
         over a punter.BANESThe thinking being that
         if we lose the toss, we
         have to be able to at
         least kick off.

Both coaches laugh nervously.     McGinty
doesn't say anything.PILACHOWSKIOkay. Here's the list
         of every player cut

McGinty takes out a piece of paper of his own
with a bunch of names on it.

                 McGINTY
         We're going to go
         another way here. I've
         done some scouting
         since I retired. On an
         ad hoc basis, of
         course. And what I

         people I've kept an eye

         disgusting!

Lee walks up. McGinty bows and says
something in Japanese. Lee bows and answers
back in Japanese. Then they shake hands.

         I met Mickey in Hawaii.
         When he was even
         bigger. He's a Sumo
         wrestler. That means
         he's an expert at

         I first saw him play
         right here in D.C. for
         Galludet College. He's
         a hell of an athlete.
         You won't have to tell

play. He's looking down field when he sees
something scary.SHANEOh shit! No!

He throws the ball away and then is nailed

them.

A little boy stops one of the Redskins and
asks for an autograph on a program. Theplayer gives it to him and the kid walks
away.

Andre and Jamal sit facing each other. Andre
throws a vicious forearm at Jamal's head but
Jamal catches it. They both nod in approval.

Walter Cochran is reading his Bible in front
of his locker, which features a picture of
Jesus and a cross.

Mickey Lee (ex-sumo) is sitting in front of a
bowl of hard boiled eggs. He's methodically
popping them into his mouth. He eats four as

him eat.PILACHOWSKIWhat are you, crazy?

from his flanker position but then changes

just standing there looking at him. Shane
runs over to him and hands him the ball.

Meanwhile, the Patriot defense is going the
other direction.

Lamont takes off.

One cornerback is not taken in. The guy
dives for Lamont's legs. We hear a CLANK as

The Patriot right defensive end breaks
through and reaches for Murray. The only
person in his way is Shane, still kneeling in

Shane does a three-step drop from the
shotgun.

Cochran and Lee hit out on either side of
Morris, giving him a clear shot at Shane.

Morris comes hard and fast.

Shane looks downfield, winds up, turns and
fires the ball at Morris's head.

The ball goes like a bullet for five feet and
then sticks like a dart in Morris's face
guard.

For a moment, Morris is blinded.

And Shane is dumbfounded.

Then Morris starts to wrestle the ball out of
his mask.SHANEGet him!

stumbling down field with the ball still
stuck in his helmet.MADDEN (V.O.)Morris intercepts!
         Wait! The ball is

in the helmet, which flies off and rolls
across the field with the ball still stuck in

New York players have been slow to pick this
up because they, too, have been admiring the
lick that Murray put on Morris.

Suddenly, the whole team is chasing Lee.

They catch him pretty easily at the twenty,
but Lee represents a lot of weight.

Lee staggers across the ten, shaking players
off left and right.

One defensive halfback sacrifices himself and
throws himself at Lee's feet.

again, walks on the guy (who screams inagony) and falls into the end zone carrying
three players with him.ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALLJohn is beside himself.MADDENLee scores! Lee

that an on-side kick is coming.

Bateman is standing in the hot spot for
recovering the ball.

Shane and everyone with decent hands is on
the field.Pacifico lines it up and boots it ten yards.

The ball takes a crazy hop, hits a Giant, and
ricochets off him.

Bateman runs over two guys and grabs the ball
on the bounce. He's got it.

But Bateman doesn't go down. He turns and
starts running across the field.

Shane runs after him.SHANENo! Danny, go down!
         You're using up the
         clock!

But Bateman likes this new job: kick-off
returner! Especially after he runs over a
Giant and stiff-arms another.

Bateman is finally trapped on the far
sideline after gaining perhaps eight yards.

So, he turns and starts running back the
other way.

Shane has been chasing him and now sees
Bateman running back at him.

Shane has no choice but to throw himself in
front of Bateman's legs.

Bateman goes down.

the kiss with a "Wooooooo!"AL (V.O.)Well, this is a first.

Most of the Dallas players are down and
screaming.

Jamal stands across from a DEFENSIVE LINEMAN.
He hasn't touched the guy. But he nods to
the player to look at his hand.

The guy looks down just as Jamal flicks open
a deadly-looking switchblade.

The guy jumps back and yells:DEFENDERHe's got a knife!

But there is so much confusion that nobody
pays any attention. Jamal slips the knife
away.AL (V.O.)Whoa! Flags fly
