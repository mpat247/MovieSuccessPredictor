          It skips along, connecting with Finn in his rear and
          EXPLODING with such force that water skyrockets into the
          night clouds.

          CONVERTS into a submarine. From his trunk he releases four
          DECOY tires which float to the surface like body parts.

           billionaire Miles Axlerod, in an
           attempt to become the first car to
           circumnavigate the globe without
           GPS, ironically ran out of gas and
           found himself trapped in the wild!
                         
          We see images of newspaper headlines, search crews.MEL DORADO (ON TV)Feared dead, he emerged 36 days
           later, running on a fuel he'd
           distilled himself from the natural
           elements! Since then he's sold his
           oil fortune, converted himself from
           a gas-guzzler into an electric car,
           and has devoted his life to finding
           a renewable, clean-burning fuel!15.Images of oil derricks torn down; Miles Axlerod getting

           race car," then why must he rest,
           eh?MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)Cause he knows what's important.
           Every now and then he prefers just
           to slow down, enjoy life.FRANCESCO (ON TV)Ah, you heard it! Lightning McQueen
           prefers to be slow! Of course, this
           is not news to Francesco. When I
           want to go to sleep I watch one of

           cold.

           there's a crowd.
                         
          When Sally says his name, she enunciates each part, as if
          Italian were her mother's tongue.MCQUEENWait, why do you know his name? And
           don't say it like that. It's three
           syllables, not ten.18.SALLYWhat? He's nice to look at. You
           know, open-wheeled and all.MCQUEENWhat's wrong with fenders? I

           needs a caller who can provide a
           little more intellectual
           stimulation. Like a dump truck.

           This is the difference between you
           and Francesco. Francesco knows how
           good he is. He does not need to
           surround himself with tow trucks to

           new motto?
                         
          Francesco goes ballistic in Italian. They cut his mic.MILES AXLEROD (ON TV)Well, this sounds like something
           that needs to be settled on the
           race course. What do you say,
           Lightning McQueen? We've still got
           room for one more racer.MCQUEENWell, I would love to. The only
