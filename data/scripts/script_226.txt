          Here and there we see a huge block of stone blocking the
          road. The sun is shining but it has a hard time making it
          through the foliage. In the distance we see four guys
          walking TOWARD the CAMERA. There is a swagger to their
          walk. MII� is singing. The others are humming along. The
          melody of the song of "0 Bury Me Not On the Lone Prairie"
          but it's a loose version.MIMEAND WHEN I DIE...WON'T YOU BURY MEON THE"PARKING LOT OF THE A AND PBLOW OUT THE CANDLES AND BLOW OUT TIE LAMPSAND LIGHT MY PYRE WITH MY TRADING STAMPSI HAD TWO BOOKS BUT I NEEDED THREE RTO DELIVER ME FROM THE A AND P.I HAD THREE BOOKS BUT I NEEDED FOURTO GO TO HEAVEN AND REDEEM MY SOUL.By this time the four are in front of the CAMERA. Mike is
          handsome and well built. CYRIL is tall and skinny. MOOCHER
          is very short. DAVE, hanging back a little, is carrying a
          large trophy.DAVEBravo, Mike! Bravo! BellisimotCYRILDid you really make all that up?
          They pass.ANOTHER ANGLEThe presence of the quarry is felt much stronger now. More
          and more blocks of cut stone appear. The guys are dwarfed
          by them. They have to climb over some.MIKEI sent away for this stuff from
          Wyoming. It'll tell you everything.
          Since you don't believe me maybe
          you'll believe it when you see it.CYRILAnd we'd work on the same ranch
          and sleep in the bunkhouse

          up around the guys.CYRILAre you really going to shave
          your legs?DAVECerto. All the Italians do it.MIKEThat's some country. The women
          don't shave theirs.CYRILSTOP!(pauses as ifTHUNDERSTRUCK;hand on heart)
          It was somewhere along here that
          I lost all interest in life. Ah,

          Dolores Reineke and fat Marvin.
          Why? Why Dolores?MOOCHERThey're married now.

          Cyril. Had I not told you about
          the two of them you never would
          have followed them out here.CYRIL-Thank you, Mike. You made me
          lose all interest in life and

          anymore.ANOTHER ANGLEThey are now standing above a huge pool of water with sheer
          cliffs on three sides. Abandoned derricks loom in the
          distance. Dave is now humming softly a Neapolitan song.
          They begin the descent.CYRILI kind of miss school. You know.
          This will be the first time nobody's
          going to ask us to write a theme
          about how we spent our summer.MIKERemember the Tomb of the
          Unknown Substitute Teacher.MOOCHERShe believed us too.MIKE(TEACHER'S VOICE)Sex spelled backwards x-es.CYRILWhen you're sixteen they call it
          sweet sixteen. When you're eighteen
          you get to drink, see dirty movies
          and vote. But what the hell do you
          do when you're nineteen.567Cont.REVISED - "BAMBINO" - 6/16/78 3-AX1 Cont.2MIKEYou leave home.CYRILMy dad says Jesus never went
          further than fifty miles from
          his home.
          Mike is skipping down the rocks toward the water, taking
          clothes off as he does. The rest follow.MIKEAnd look what happened to him.
          Mike jumps into the water. Moocher and Cyril follow. Dave
          looks on.FADE THROUGH TO:DAVE'S P.O.V. 1-AThe guys are swimming. Dave is holding his trophy casually,
          enjoying the beautiful day. He pulls out a little
          Italian Phrase Book. Finds what he wants.DAVEOggi fa bello,-non e vero?MIKESure thing, partner.MOOCHERC'mon in.DAVEI read where this Italian coach
          said you should never swim after

          Moocher and Mike splash water at him and swim away.FADE THROUGH TO:567REVISED - "BAMBINO" - 6/16/78 4ROCKS BY THE WATER 1-BAll four guys are sunbathing looking at the water. Deep X
          down, at the bottom of the quarry hole we see an old icebox.
          Mike is staring at it. The mood is one of total relaxation.MIREAren't you glad we got fired from
          The A and P. Right now we'd be X
          working.MOOCHERWe didn't get fired. You got-
          fired. We quit.MIKEOne for all and all for one.MOOCHERThere aren't many places, you

          that'd be great. Like when they
          get hit on their head with a
          frying pan and their head looks
          like a frying pan-with a handle
          and everything. And then they go
          b-r-r-r.
          (shakes his head)
          And their head comes back to
          normal. That'd be great..MIKEHow come you're so stupid, Cyril.CYRILI don't know. I think I have
          a dumb heredity. What's your
          excuse, Mike?
          Mike hits him hard on the arm. Cyril winces. Mike stands up.
          He makes sure they're all watching and dives in. The guys
          talk as they follow his progress.DAVEYou hear from your folks, Moocher?
          567 Cont.REVISED - "BAMBINO" - 8/12/78 51-B Coat.MOOCHER ..Yeah, my Dad called. He says
          there's a lot more jobs in'Chicago.
          He hasn't got anything yet.
          Mike has reached the icebox. He opens the door. Goes in.
          Shuts the door.MOOCHERHe wanted to know if the house
          was sold. They could use the
          money.DAVEYou can come and live with me
          when it's sold. In Italy
          everybody lives together.
          All three of them are getting concerned about Mike.MOOCHEREver since you won that Italian X
          bike you've been acting weird. You
          really think you are Italian.CYRILI .wouldn't mind thinking I was
          s omebody myself.
          All three of them stand up.MOOCHERMaybe the door is stuck. God
          dammit!
          Moocher dives in. Dave and Cyril follow. Moocher swims
          down to the icebox, forces the door open. They surface.
          As soon as they hit the surface we hear:MIKE�o.s.}
          Yoo--hoo .THE GUYS' P.O.V.They see Mike standing on top of the rock above them.MIKEIt's got no back on it!
          He laughs triumphantly. He's ready to dive in again when he
          pauses and looks. High above where he stands on the other
          side of the quarry hole, we see several figures. The guys
          are swimming toward the rocks and looking at the figures too.

          Mike is still on top of the rock. High above him are the
          College Kids. Three guys and three girls. One of the guys
          is standing on the ledge above the water. Our guys are
          looking at the College Kid on the ledge. He seems intent
          on diving into the water. It's a distance of at least eighty
          feet. He pushes off and dives in executing a beautiful
          somersault into a swan dive.CLOSEUP - OUR GUYSThey are stunned.CLOSEUP - MIKEHe's obviously envious.. He looks from the diver toward the
          guys and seems to feel his position undermined.CYRILI've never seen anyone dive

          of the fraternities and sororities-are located along this
          stretch. Neat lawns line the area. The houses are enormous:
          an architectural mixture of old manor house and modern motel.
          The college kids are outside on the lawns. Some are reading.
          Girls in bikinis sunbathing. Guys washing their cars. Some
          other guys passing the football around. Transistor radios
          playing. Mike drives slowly.INT. MIKE'S CARAll the guys are looking out of the windows as if they were
          in a museum. Mike looks at the expensive cars along the way.

          huge well-built guys. Dave just looks.CYRILGoing to college must do'something

          Ahead of Mike's car we see two Guys and two Girls playing
          Frisbee. They are standing on the lawns and throwing the
          Frisbee to each other across the street. Mike's car is
          moving slowly forward when an ill-thrown Frisbee lands on
          the street. Mike sees it and speeds up. A Girl is running
          to get it but Mike gets there first and runs over it. Dave
          gets a quick look at the Girl as she stops"suddenly to keep
          from getting hit. The two college Guys run out and give'
          Mike the finger. He sees them in the rearview mirror.MIKEHey, those bastards are giving
          us the finger.
          He slams on the brakes.MOOCHERHey, c'mon, Mike. We're on
          their turf.
          Dave is looking back at the Girl. The two Guys are
          challenging Mike, motioning to him to come back. The two
          Girls are trying to talk them out of it. Mike-is gunning
          the car.MIKEThey think they own the place.MOOCHERThey do.CYRILBesides, you've humiliated them
          enough. In ancient Japan when
          you ran over a samurai's Frisbee
          he had to commit suicide.
          Just as he laughs Mike shifts the car in reverse. The
          two Guys and Girls are standing in the middle of the road.
          The Guys are coming forward thinking Mike's going to stop,
          but Mike has no intention of stopping. The Girls and the
          Guys split as Mike's car roars between them. Once again
          Dave catches a fleeting glimpse of the Girl. Having
          scattered them, Mike makes a U-turn and drives away in
          the direction he came from.

          The people and the kids look at him like he's an oddball,
          but Dave does not notice. A woman is shaking a rug ahead
          of him, and she looks so Italian that he can't help but
          smile. A big blonde GIRL is coming out of the house
          dressed in a waitress outfit. She sees Dave.G=Dave...is Moocher home?
