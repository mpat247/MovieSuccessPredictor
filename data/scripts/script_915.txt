		days as they say...

	As the sun sets, the light is turning from yellow to amber. 
	Hi and Ed watch, their heads following its slow downward

		all she thought about.

	The amber is turning to a more neutral dusky light as the 
	sun has set. Hi and Ed continue to stare at the point where

	The businessman takes his newspaper and releases the machine

	He flips the paper over to look at the headline.FRONT PAGE OF NEWSPAPERThe banner headline of the Tempe Intelligencer is:"ARIZONA QUINTS GO HOME!"The subhead: "More Than We Can Handle,' Laughs Dad." Next to

	A pull back from the paper shows Hi and Ed reading it together 
	at home. They look from the paper to each other.

	Hi opens to an inside page and we pan a row of pictures - 
	the five tots with their names underneath: "HARRY, BARRY, 
	LARRY, GARRY and NATHAN JR."VOICE OVER...but we thought it was unfair that

	driver's seat of Hi's Chevy. Hi enters frame and cinches 
	down a ladder that is tied to the roof of the car. Pieces of 
	red flag flutter at either end of the ladder where it sticks 
	out beyond the car.VOICE OVERWith the benefit of hindsight maybe 
		it wasn't such a hot idea...

	Hi gets in the car.FROM BEHIND THE CHEVYIt starts down the long, winding road leading away from the

	The title of the film burns in: "RAISING ARIZONA". A building 
	chord snaps off in a shock cut to:SUBURBAN LIVING ROOM EVENINGTableau of a couple at home. Nathan Arizona is on the 
	telephone, his stocking feet up on an ottoman. Florence sits 
	reading Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care.

	The living room is dominated by a large oil portrait of Nathan

	Florence stops reading and looks up at the ceiling. Nathan 
	is oblivious.NATHAN...Miles, all I know is I'm away 
		from the office to have me some kids 
		and everything goes straight to heck! 
		I ain't gonna stand for it!

	Another title is supered below the first: "SEPTEMBER 17, 
	1985". The baby stops crying and Florence's attention returns 
	to her book.VOICE OVER...Yeah, and if a frog had wings he 
		wouldn't bump his ass a-hoppin'! I'm 
		sick of your excuses, Miles! It is

	As he throws out his wrist to look at his watch a third title

	He starts to replace the receiver but brings it back with an

	As he slams the phone into the cradle the titles disappear. 
	Another baby starts crying. Florence looks up at the ceiling.NATHANThat sounds like Larry.

	Close on the crying baby as Hi bounces it, gently but 
	desperately.HIShhhh! Shh! Nice baby...

	He starts to lower it back into the crib. The crib is 
	unpainted with the name of each baby burned Bonanza-style 
	into the headboard: Harry, Barry, Larry, Garry, and Nathan 
	Jr. Instead of quieting as he is lowered into the crib, the 
	squalling baby only sets off one of his brothers. Hi hurriedly 
	lifts him back out.

	He looks desperately around the room.

	The room is wallpapered with nursery rhyme characters.

	There are toys strewn around. There is one adult-sized easy 
	chair in the corner.

	Hi carries the baby over to the chair, stepping on and 
	reacting to the squeal of a squeeze-me toy on the way. He 
	sits the baby deep in - the chair and then returns to the 
	crib to deal with the second crying baby.

	He lifts the baby out of the crib and gently bounces it. 
	This baby stops crying.

	Another one in the crib starts bawling.

	Hi sets the second baby down on the floor and gives it a 
	rattle to keep it pacified. He reaches for the third baby in 
	the crib. Sweat stands out on Hi 's brow. He is desperately 
	chucking the third baby under the chin when we hear a muffledPTHUMP!He whirls to look across the darkened room.

	The first baby has dropped off the easy chair and is 
	energetically crawling away toward a shadowy corner.LIVING ROOMNathan and Florence are sitting stock-still, staring at the

	across the room.

	He hefts the other baby with his free arm and brings the air 
	back to the crib.

	He turns to look frantically around the room.

	The other three babies have disappeared.

	There is perfect quiet.

	Hi goes over to the closet door, which is ajar, and swings 
	it open.

	He reaches under a moving pile of clothes on the floor and 
	pulls out a baby.

	He returns it to the crib and freezes, listening.

	The sound of a rattle.

	He drops to the floor to look under the crib.WIDE ANGLE UNDER CRIBA baby holding a rattle leers into the camera in the

	a plop! a baby drops onto Hi 's back from the crib above.

	Hi twists one arm back to grope for the baby crawling on top 
	of him.

	Hi beams at Nathan Jr. Ed smiles at Nathan Jr. Nathan Jr. 
	looks from one to the other, deadpan. They seem to be waiting

	Silence.

	Ed is getting up.HI...He's a scandal, honey! He's a

	As he squeezes the cable release - FLASH - the image 
	momentarily freezes on Hi beaming, Nathan Jr. staring, and 
	Ed looking at Hi with a little bit of concern.DARK FIELD SAME NIGHTThe rolling thunder has built to a thunderclap at the cut, 
	and the flash of the Polaroid match cuts to lightning throwing 
	a momentarily harsh glare on the field.

	Rain beats down on the bare patch of ground we are looking 
	at - by now just a patch of mud.

	Faraway lightning flickers and we hear the rumble of more 
	thunder approaching, then suddenly:

	THWACK - A head pops up out of the mud. It is Gale, the con 
	we saw in group therapy. He bellows as lightning and thunder 
	flash and crack nearby.

	His head is covered with mud, although the driving rain is 
	already starting to wash it away.

	We are beginning to track in an arc around Gale's head, who 
	is now struggling, working to get his shoulders and arms up 
	out of the mud. The end of the 180-degree arc and a flash of 
	lightning reveal, way in the distance, the wire-topped walls 
	of a penitentiary.

	Still bellowing, as if in some primal rage, Gale has gotten 
	his muck-covered arms up out of the earth and is now pushing 
	down to haul up the rest of his body. It comes with much 
	effort, and with the loud sucking-popping sounds of the 
	fiercely clinging mud.

	Finally he is free.

	With a great cry, the mud-covered man plunges his right arm 
	straight back down into the earth, all the way up to his 
	shoulder. He gropes intently and then, apparently having 
	grabbed hold of something underground, he starts pulling.

	His arm comes slowly back up out of the mud. Clasped in his 
	hand is - a human foot.

	Bellowing with effort he continues to pull, liberating the 
	foot... leg... torso of his companion, and finally his head.

	As the rain starts to wash the mud off his companion's head 
	we see that it is his friend Evelle.

	Both are bellowing.

	Mud sucks and pops.

	Thunder crashes.INT. GAS STATION MENS ROOMAt the cut the ear-splitting thunder drops out to quiet. We 
	hear only the muffled patter of rain and the hum of a bare 
	fluorescent.

	The two bedraggled escaped cons are standing side by side, 
	combing their hair in the mirror. The men seem absorbed in 
	their task, using hair jelly from a jar that sits on the 
	shelf between them to restore their duck's-ass haircuts.

	Evelle cracks the bathroom door and looks out into the rain.EVELLE...Okay.GALEWhat is it?EVELLEMercury. Looks nice.EXT. GAS STATIONThe two men are trotting out to a Mercury that sits untended 
	at a gas island, a gas hose on automatic stuck in its tank.

	As Gale starts up the car Evelle yanks the hose out and drops 
	it to the ground. Gale is already starting to peel out as 
	Evelle gets in.WIDE SHOT TRAILER LIVING ROOMLate at night. Hi sits asleep on the sofa at the far end of 
	the room, in a pool of lamp light.

	We hear faint, distant knocking. As we track in toward Hi 
	the knocking becomes louder and more present.

	As we approach Hi we see that several Polaroids are spread 
	over his gently rising and falling chest.

	By the time we tighten on his face the knocking has become 
	quite loud.VOICEOpen up!

	Hi starts awake with a grunt.VOICE...Open up in air!

	He looks up, alarmed.HI'S POVThe front door of the trailer. Someone is pounding 
	insistently.VOICEOpen up! It's a police!BACK TO HIHe sits up and tenses. He looks around.

	Ed stands in her nightgown at the mouth of the hallway, 
	holding Nathan Jr. and squinting at Hi. She hisses:EDHi! What's goin' on?VOICEPo-lice, son! Open her up!

	Hi gets to his feet, hurriedly tosses the Polaroids under a 
	cushion of the couch and takes out a gun.HIGet in the bedroom.EDThey ain't gonna take Nathan?!HIWell I'd like to see 'em fly.

	As Ed turns back to the bedroom:VOICEOpen up and maybe we'll letcha plea-

	door:

	Hi's footsteps cross the living room, the click of the door 
	opening, silence... a burst of raucous male laughter.HI'S VOICE...Honey! Come on out here! Want you 
		to meet a couple friends of mine!LIVING ROOMAs Ed enters, carrying Nathan Jr. All three men - Hi, Gale, 
	and Evelle - are beaming at her.HIHoney, like you to meet Gale and

	Gale roars with laughter.HI...Boys, this - here's my wife.GALEMa'am.EVELLEMiz McDunnough.

	Ed smiles politely, then squints at Hi.EDKind of late for visitors, isn't it 
		Hi?HIWell yeah honey, but these boys tell

		Gotta show a little hospitality.

	Gale is admiring the baby.GALEWell now H.I., looks like you been 
		up to the devil's bidnis!EVELLEThat a him or a her?EDIt's a little boy.GALEGot a name, does he?

	Hi and Ed look at each other uncomfortably. Hi clears his 
	throat.HIWell so far we just been using Junior.EDWe call him Junior.EVELLESay, thairs good - JR., just like on 
		the Teevee.

	Gale is staring at the streamers and decorations. Reading 
	aloud:GALE"Welcome... Home... Son." Where's he 
		been?

	Hi and Ed respond simultaneously:HITulsa.EDPhoenix.HIHe was, uh... he was visiting his

	As the two men move toward the couch Ed hesitantly pipes up:EDHi, it's two in the morning...

	She wrinkles her nose.ED...What's that smell?

	Apologetically:GALEWe don't always smell like this, Miz 
		McDunnough. I was just explainin' to

	He is looking at the baby.GALE...My Lord he's cute.EVELLEHe's a little outlaw, you can see 
		that.EDNow listen, you folks can't stay 
		here!

	Gale, Evelle, and Hi look up at Ed, dumbstruck. After a beat:EVELLE...Ma'am?EDYou just can't stay! I appreciate 
		your bein' friends of Hi and all, 
		but this is a decent family now...

	She looks at Hi.ED...I mean we got a toddler here!

	Gale leans in close to Hi, a look of sincere concern on his 
	face, and says under his breath:GALESay, who wears the pants round hereH.I.?HINow honey -EDDon't you honey me. Now you boys can 
		set a while and catch up, and then 
		you'll be on your way.

	There is an awkward silence as she leaves and slams the 
	bedroom door.

	Gale is carefully studying his thumbnail; Evelle stares 
	fixedly at the ceiling. Still looking at his thumb:GALEGotcha on a awful short leash, don't 
		she H.I.?BEDROOMSometime later, as Hi tiptoes in. Ed lies in bed facing the 
	wall; we see only the back of her head. Hi sits gingerly on 
	the edge of the bed and, smiling, sticks a finger through 
	the bars of the crib to play with the baby.

	The sound of the TV set in the living room filters faintly 
	in.EDThey still here?

	Hi is momentarily startled, then goes on playing with the 
	baby.HIYeah, they're just gonna stay a day 
		or two. It's raining out honey, they

	Ed finally turns to face him. We hear the two men laugh

	The roar of his engine and clank of his chains recede as the 
	Biker gradually dissolves into thin air.

	We are left looking at the empty street and the faraway 
	Arizona house.

	The receding roar has left behind eerily beautiful singing, 
	a woman singing a lullaby. Faintly, behind the singing, there 
	is also a droning high-pitched noise.

	The camera starts floating forward very close to the ground, 
	moving slowly toward the Arizona house. The high-pitched 
	drone is becoming less faint under the singing.

	The camera is accelerating. The drone is growing louder - we 
	can now tell that it is a human scream.

	As we approach the Arizona house we can see that a ladder is 
	propped up to a second-story window.

	We are moving quite fast now. The scream all but buries the 
	singing.

	We are rushing toward the house, toward the base of the 
	ladder, the sustained scream drawing us on.

	We hurtle toward and then straight up the ladder with no 
	abatement of speed, sucked forward by the deafening scream.

	We reach the top and hurtle - THWAP! - through the white 
	curtains of the open second-story window into the nursery to 
	reveal Florence Arizona, her back to us, screaming over the 
	crib.

	We are rocketing toward her.

	Throughout the speech Nathan stalks the room, working himself 
	into a frenzy, furiously putting coffee cups onto coasters, 
	generally cleaning up, hectoring the police, and swiping 
	their feet off his furniture.NATHAN...Hell, that's your forte, trackin'

		hole in the ground!!HOLE IN THE GROUND - DAYSpecifically, it is the hole in the muddy patch of earth 
	that Gale and Evelle climbed out of. We hear only the squish - 
	suck of many feet walking around in the mud offscreen.

	We are pulling back to reveal the feet-the shiny black patent 
	leather shoes and blue pants cuffs - becoming quickly 
	spattered - of several policemen milling about the hole.

	German shepherds sniff around also.

	With a roar, motorcycle wheels enter frame. The bike's 
	jackbooted rider casually tools around the hole once; police 
	step back and dogs skitter away to give him room.

	He backs toward the camera and stops, standing astride the 
	bike. The burning stub of a cheroot is dropped into frame; 
	it hisses angrily and dies in the mud. We start to crane up.

	The whipcracking Biker cue mixes up. The Biker's motorcycle 
	idles with a deep rumble, like the roar of fire on the sun.

	We are now framed looking over the Biker's shoulder. The 
	policemen's attitude to him seems to be deferential. One cop 
	in front of him is pointing a direction. The Biker is shaking 
	his head; he doesn't think they went that way.

	Suddenly, with a loud whipcrack effect, the Biker's head 
	snaps to profile. He is staring across the field, stock-still, 
	having heard, smelled or sensed something.

	The dogs milling around the hole also react, snapping to 
	attention, a split second after the BIKER.THEIR POVA jackrabbit is bounding away at the far end of the field.THE DOGSAfter a moment, their attention returns to the hole.THE BIKERHis attention also returns to the matter at hand. He squints, 
	concentrating. His bike rumbles. Gradually his face sets in 
	a specific direction.

	We pan down to the tattoo on his shoulder: "Mama Didn't Love 
	Me." His shoulder flexes once or twice as he revs the 
	throttle; then he puts the bike in gear and it roars out of 
	frame.TRAILER KITCHEN CLOSE ON GALE AND EVELLEThey are both intently munching cornflakes, staring at 
	something offscreen. After a beat:EVELLE...Awful good cereal flakes, Miz

	She is surrounded by the rumpled sheets and blankets used by 
	the house guests. She does not respond to the ice-breaker.

	Gale puts his spoon down and picks up a cigarette which has 
	been smoking in the ashtray next to him. There is a bead of 
	milk dribbling down his chin.

	He turns up one of the last lanes, races along it and grabs 
	a carton of Huggies, still on the flat run.

	He emerges into the broad back aisle and runs along it, but 
	at the first perpendicular lane he hits, we see Officer 
	Steensma, gun leveled, at the other end. He fires.

	Hi keeps running.

	The Policeman is running along the front aisle, keeping pace 
	with Hi running along the back aisle. He squeezes off shots 
	at Hi as each lane gives him the opportunity.

	Hi abruptly stops between lanes and doubles back, losing the 
	Policeman. He runs down the second lane he comes to toward 
	the front of the store.

	The pack of dogs appears at the end of the lane and thunders 
	up toward Hi, braying at the top of their doggy lungs. The 
	lead Doberman holds in his teeth a paper 7-Eleven cap.

	Hi reverses again, and emerges into the back aisle.

	BANG! A pyramid of cranberry juice explodes at his shoulder. 
	The Policeman has been waiting at the end of the back aisle;

	Hi's knuckles scrape painfully against the plaster of the 
	too - low ceiling. Skin is flayed, plaster crumbles.

	Hi grabs at his knuckles in pain. Gale lunges with a mid-
	body tackle that sends Hi crashing into the wall.

	Gale, still on top of him, reaches back to throw a punch.

	The reach-back sends his elbow crashing through a window but 
	doesn't stop the punch.

	It connects with Hi's jaw.

	Gale throws another quick punch, all his weight behind it. 
	Hi's head bobs sideways just in time and Gale's fist goes 
	through the wall. It is momentarily stuck there.

	Hi uses the opportunity to grab Gale's one free arm with 
	both of his. He is twisting it to make Gale, roaring with 
	pain, twist around and present his back to him.

	Hi climbs aboard, grabbing Gale's face.

	Gale, still roaring, is pulling his fist out of the hole. He 
	grabs a lath exposed by the hole and pulls; it tears out of 
	the wall and snaps free, giving him a length of about two 
	feet.

	Gale is rampaging around like a grizzly bear hemmed in a too-
	small space. Hi is hanging on for dear life, his own feet 
	flailing this way and that, knocking over lamps and wall 
	fixtures as Gale bends and twirls about, trying to shake him 
	loose. Gale crashes and bounces off the walls, roaring in 
	pain and fury.

	Close shots of Gale's face show his features impossibly and 
	grotesquely contorted by Hi's hand, squeezing, gripping and 
	clutching at it.

	Lenny is reaching back to throw his knife.

	Hi, unaware, is turning to face him, presenting the plank as -

	It thunks into the plank, piercing it through.

	and squinting against the light.

	Keeping the gun trained on Hi and Ed, he slowly raises a 
	pair of eyeglasses to his nose.NATHANThe hell is goin' on?

	He advances cautiously into the nursery, gesturing with his 
	gun.NATHAN...Get away from there.

	Hi and Ed back away from the crib.

	Nathan peers in and studies the baby for a moment.

	He lays the gun down, tenderly picks up the baby and holds 
	him to his chest. A tear forms at the corner of his eye.

	Hi and Ed are quietly moving back towards the ladder.NATHAN(sharply)

	Hi and Ed Stop.NATHAN...I ain't through with you. What're

	As he bounces the baby, studying Hi and Ed:NATHANLeonard Smalls, big fella rides a 
		Harley, dresses like a rock star?HINo sir, that's who we saved him from. 
		It's a long story.NATHANSuppose you tell it.HIWell, sir, in a re-ward situation, 
		they usually say no questions asked.NATHANDo they.

	Hi shrugs.

	Nathan turns to put the baby back in the crib.NATHAN...All right, boy, I guess you got a 
		re-ward coming. Twenty thousand 
		dollars...

	He turns around with a thought:NATHAN...Or, if you need home furnishings, 
		I can give you a fine of credit at 
		any of my stores. Fact, that's the 
		way I'd rather handle it, for tax 
		reasons...HIWell-

	Nathan throws his hands up in the air.NATHANBut it's up to you.HITell you the truth, I think we'd 
		prefer the ca-EDWe don't want no reward.

	Hi does a small take, surprised at this much integrity.ED...We didn't bring him back for money.NATHANWell, we could work it that way too.EDCould I just look at him a little 
		bit more?

	She stands looking into the crib. Hi steps up next to her 
	and puts an arm around her shoulder.NATHANBe my guest, young lady... but would 
		you mind tellin' me exactly how you-

	Ed starts crying softly as she gazes into the crib. Hi murmurs 
	something to comfort her.

	Nathan is studying the two of them.NATHAN...You took him, didn't you? Wasn't 
		that biker a'tal.

	Hi turns to face him. He speaks in a rush.HII took him, sir, my wife had nothin' 
		to do with it. I crept in yon window 
		and-ED(still crying)
		We both did it. We didn't wanna hurt 
		him any; I just wanted to be a mama.HIIt wasn't for money or nothin'. We 
		just figured you had more'n you could

		committed the actual crime sir, if 
		you need to call the authorities-NATHANShutup boy, no one's callin' the 
		authorities if there's no harm done.HIThank you sir.EDThank you sir.NATHANAw bullshit. Just tell me - just 
		tell me why you did it.EDWe can't have our own.

	Nathan looks at her. Finally he nods and sighs.NATHAN...Well lookit. If you can't have 
		kids you gotta just keep tryin' and 
		hope medical science catches up with 
		you. Like Florence'n me - it caught 
		up with a vengeance. And hell, even 
		if it never does, you still got each 
		other.HISir, those're kind words. But I think 
		the wife and me are splittin' up...

	He indicates Ed with a nod of the head.HI...Her point of view is we're both 
		kinda selfish and unrealistic, so we 
		ain't too good for each other.NATHANWell ma'am, I don't know much but I 
		do know human bein's. You brought 
		back my boy so you must have your 
		good points too. I'd sure hate to 
		think of Florence leavin' me - I do 
		love her so...

	He clears his throat and turns to the door. His tone is harder 
	again:NATHAN...You can go out the way you came 
		in...

	He snaps off the lights.NATHAN...And before you go off and do 
		another foolish thing, like busting 
		up, I suggest you sleep on it...

	He has disappeared into the hall. We hear his voice receding:NATHAN...at least one night.HIGH SHOTLooking straight down at Hi, asleep in the trailer bedroom. 
	We start to crane down.VOICE OVERThat night I had a dream...EXTREME WIDE SHOTA beautiful dusk landscape. We are floating in over the field, 
	abutting the prison, that Gale and Evelle popped out of.

	In the middle background of the extreme long shot two men 
	are walking across the field.VOICE OVER...I dreamt I was as light as the

		in my life wrastled their way into 
		my slumber.BACK TO FIELDStill floating forward but now much closer to the two walking 
	men. We see that they are Gale and Evelle. Both are still 
	dyed blue.

	They are approaching the hole in the ground.VOICE OVERI dreamt that Gale and Evelle had 
		decided to return to prison...

	Evelle is starting to climb into the hole.VOICE OVER...Probably that's just as well. I 
		don't mean to sound superior, and 
		they're a swell couple guys, but...

	Evelle has disappeared and Gale starts climbing in.VOICE OVER...maybe they weren't ready yet to 
		come out into the world.FLOATING UP THE WALK OF THE ARIZONA HONEThe front door has a holly wreath on it.VOICE OVERAnd then I dreamed on, into the

	We have been isolating in on one of the children peeling the 
	wrappings off a package marked to Nathan Jr. Inside is a 
	shiny red plastic football.FLOATING IN TOWARD A STATION WAGONPulled over on the state highway in the middle of the desert, 
	a police motorcycle parked behind it. Glen is leaning out 
	the driver's window of the car talking to the state trooper 
	who stands facing him.VOICE OVERI saw Glen, a few years later, still 
		havin' no luck gettin' the cops to

		Ed...

	Glen is grinning and talking with his hands cupped in front 
	of him, as when he told Hi about the Pollack who almost 
	stepped in the pile of shit.

	The trooper, in crash helmet and dark sunglasses, is listening 
	tight-lipped and stone-faced as Glen finishes his story and 
	slaps his knee.VOICE OVER...Maybe he threw in one Pollack 
		joke too many...

	The trooper is clicking open his ballpoint pen and reaching 
	his citation book from his breast pocket. The name tag on 
	the pocket says "SGT. KOWALSKI."VOICE OVER...I don't know.FLOATING IN TOWARD A FOOTBALLIt sits on a tee in the middle of a football field.VOICE OVERAnd still I dreamed on...

	A cleated foot boots the football out of frame.VOICE OVER...further into the future than I'd

	kicked ball.VOICE OVER...Watching Nathan Jr.'s progress 
		from afar...

	He catches the ball and starts running.VOICE OVER...Taking pride in his accomplishments 
		as if he were our own...

	He is skillfully eluding and stiff-arming tacklers.VOICE OVER...Wondering if he ever thought of 
		us.

	He reaches the end zone and triumphantly spikes the football.

	He whips off his helmet and we track in on the face of the 
	rosy-cheeked high-school bruiser.VOICE OVER...and hoping that maybe we'd 
		broadened his horizons a little,

		how they'd got broadened.BACK TO BEDROOMStill craning down, now very close to the sleeping Hi.VOICE OVERBut still I hadn't dreamt nothin' 
		about me'n Ed. Until the end...DISSOLVE THROUGH TOA COUPLEThe man and woman are sitting on a sofa in the foreground 
	with their backs to the camera. They are in the living room 
	of Hi and Ed's trailer, which is suffused with a warm golden 
	light.

	As they face the trailer's front door, all we see of the 
	couple is the backs of their heads. They both have white 
	hair, the woman's pulled into a bun. The old man wears a 
	cardigan, the woman a shawl.VOICE OVER...And this was cloudier 'cause it 
		was years, years away.

	The front door bursts open. Two young couples are entering 
	as their kids - about a dozen of them - stream in around 
	them.

	The old couple on the couch raise their arms to embrace their 
	visitors. The children boil onto the couch.VOICE OVER...But I saw an old couple bein' 
		visited by their children - and all 
		their grandchildren too. And the old 
		couple wasn't screwed up, and neither 
		were their kids or their grandkids. 
		And I don't know, you tell me. This 
		whole dream, was it wishful thinking?  
		Was I just fleein' reality, like I 
		know I'm liable to do?FLOATING IN TOWARD A LONG DINING TABLEIn the trailer. The table is all laid out with a Thanksgiving 
	dinner, a huge turkey sitting at the far end.

	Cut-out letters at the other end of the room say: "WELCOMEHOME KIDS!"The grandchildren are running into frame and taking their 
	seats at the table, accompanied by their parents.VOICE OVER...But me'n Ed, we can be good too...

	The elderly couple enter from either side of the camera and 
	stand in the foreground, backs to us, facing the table.VOICE OVER...And it seemed real. It seemed 
		like us. And it seemed like well... 
		our home... If not Arizona, then a 
		land, not too far away, where all 
		parents are strong and wise and 
		capable, and all children are happy 
		and beloved... I dunno, maybe it was 
		Utah.

	The elderly man drapes an arm around his wife's shoulder and 
	draws her close. She rests her head against his shoulder,
