                                  Final Production DraftThis is a Southern story, full of lies and fabrications, but 
               truer for their inclusion.FADE IN:A RIVER.We're underwater, watching a fat catfish swim along.

               This is The Beast.EDWARD (V.O.)There are some fish that cannot be 
                         caught. It's not that they're faster 
                         or stronger than other fish. They're 
                         just touched by something extra. 
                         Call it luck. Call it grace. One 
                         such fish was The Beast.

               The Beast's journey takes it past a dangling fish hook, baited 
               with worms. Past a tempting lure, sparkling in the sun. Past 
               a swiping bear claw. The Beast isn't worried.EDWARD (V.O.)By the time I was born, he was already 
                         a legend. He'd taken more hundred-
                         dollar lures than any fish in Alabama. 
                         Some said that fish was the ghost of 
                         Henry Walls, a thief who'd drowned 
                         in that river 60 years before. Others 
                         claimed he was a lesser dinosaur, 
                         left over from the Cretaceous period.INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (1973)WILL BLOOM, AGE 3, listens wide-eyed as his father EDWARD 
               BLOOM, 40's and handsome, tells the story. In every gesture, 
               Edward is bigger than life, describing each detail with 
               absolute conviction.EDWARDI didn't put any stock into such 
                         speculation or superstition. All I 
                         knew was I'd been trying to catch 
                         that fish since I was a boy no bigger

                         worms, lures, peanut butter, peanut 
                         butter-and-cheese. But on that day I 
                         had a revelation: if that fish was 
                         the ghost of a thief, the usual bait 
                         wasn't going to work. I would have 
                         to use something he truly desired.

               While the other boys are rapt with attention, Will looks 
               bored. He's heard this story before.EDWARDI tied my ring to the strongest line 
                         they made -- strong enough to hold 
                         up a bridge, they said, if just for 
                         a few minutes -- and I cast upriver.INT. BLOOM FRONT HALL - NIGHT (1987)Edward is chatting up Will's pretty DATE to the homecoming 
               dance. She is enjoying the story, but also the force of 
               Edward's charisma. He's hypnotizing.EDWARD (CONT'D)The Beast jumped up and grabbed it 
                         before the ring even hit the water. 
                         And just as fast, he snapped clean 
                         through that line.

               WILL, now 17 with braces, is fuming and ready to leave. His 
               mother SANDRA -- from whom he gets his good looks and 
               practicality -- stands with him at the door.EDWARDYou can see my predicament. My wedding

                         down-river for three days and three 
                         nights, until I finally had him boxed 
                         in.

               Will regards his father with exasperated contempt.EDWARDWith these two hands, I reached in 
                         and snatched that fish out of the 
                         river. I looked him straight in the 
                         eye. And I made a remarkable

               is their wedding reception, crowded with their friends and 
               family. They should be joyful, but Will is furious.

               Edward has the floor, ostensibly for a toast. The room is 
               cozy and drunk.EDWARDThis fish, the Beast. The whole time 
                         we were calling it a him, when in 
                         fact it was a her. It was fat with 
                         eggs, and was going to lay them any 
                         day.

               Over near the doorway, we spot Sandra, just returned from 
               the restrooms. She looks gorgeous. She couldn't be any happier 
               if this were her own wedding.EDWARDNow, I was in a situation. I could 
                         gut that fish and get my ring back, 
                         but doing so I would be killing the 
                         smartest catfish in the Ashton River, 
                         soon to be mother of a hundred others.

               Will can't take any more. Josephine tries to hold him back, 
               but he gets up and leaves. Edward doesn't even notice.EDWARDDid I want to deprive my soon-to-be-

                         and I, well, we had the same destiny.

               As he leaves, Will mutters in perfect unison with his father --EDWARD AND WILLWe were part of the same equation.

               Will reaches the door, where his mother intercepts him.SANDRAHoney, it's still your night.

               Will can't articulate his anger. He just leaves.EDWARDNow, you may well ask, since this 
                         lady fish wasn't the ghost of a thief, 
                         why did it strike so quick on gold 
                         when nothing else would attract it?

                         That was the lesson I learned that 
                         day, the day my son was born.

               He focuses his words on Sandra. This story is -- and has 
               always been -- about her more than anyone.EDWARDSometimes, the only way to catch an 
                         uncatchable woman is to offer her a 
                         wedding ring.

               A LAUGH from the crowd.

               Edward motions for Sandra to get up here with him. As she 
               crosses, we can see that thirty years of marriage has not 
               lessened their affection for each other.

               As they kiss, Edward tweaks her chin a special little way.

               The crowd APPLAUDS.

               Edward toasts the happy couple. Josephine covers well for 
               her absent husband, a smile as warm as summer.

                         life, it's impossible to separate 
                         the fact from the fiction, the man 
                         from the myth. The best I can do is 
                         to tell it the way he told me.

               We LOOK DOWN at the river, where Edward's reflection is caught 
               in the dark water. As the water ripples past, something 
               changes.

               Sure enough, as we LOOK UP again, it's a younger EDWARD BLOOM, 
               20's, staring into the water. He's not just handsome, not 
               just charming. It's as if all the forces of the natural world 
               had conspired to create him.WILL (V.O.)It doesn't always make sense, and 
                         most of it never happened.

                         is.

               Suddenly, we hear a POP as a slimy mass of human being rockets

               tight, but the infant is slippery like a fish. It shoots up 
               into air.

               The NURSES and the Husband try to grab the baby, but no one

               that insistent European sound.

               As it keeps RINGING, we look to see the apartment is mostly 
               empty, just a few half-unpacked boxes. A cradle is still in

               feeling before he can.INT. 747 / FLYING - NIGHTHours later, and the lights are dimmed. Most of the PASSENGERS 
               are asleep, including Josephine. Her head is propped against 
               Will's shoulder, her hands tucked under her belly.

               Will watches her sleep, brushing back her hair. A beat, then 
               he notices a BORED BOY in the next row over.

               Off the glow of the reading light, the boy is using his hands 
               to cast shadows on the seat back. The kid is pretty good, 
               making a convincing bird, a passable monkey, and finally a 
               dog.

               We PUSH IN on the silhouettes.EDWARD (O.S., PRELAP)So which one's it gonna be? The Monkey 
                         in the Barn, the Dog in the Road?

               Focusing on the final shadow, we...MATCH CUT TO:INT. BLOOM HOUSE - NIGHT...come to find Edward making the shapes.

               Will (6) sits in his pajamas on the floor next to him. The 
               endtable lamp lies between them, its shade off to cast big 
               shadows on the wall.WILLThe one about the witch.EDWARDYour mom says I can't tell you that 
                         one anymore. You get nightmares.WILLI'm not scared.

               Edward looks around for a beat, seeing if his wife is in 
               earshot. He then leans in, complicitous.EDWARDNeither was I. At first.

               Will smiles, excited to hear the forbidden story.EDWARDThis all happened in the swamp outside 
                         of Ashton. Kids weren't supposed to 
                         go out in the swamp, on account of 
                         the snakes and spiders and quicksand 
                         that would swallow you up before you 
                         could even scream. But there were 
                         five of us out there that night: Me, 
                         Ruthie, Wilbur Freely, and the Price 
                         Brothers, Don and Zacky.

               Edward holds up his hand, counting the names on his fingers.EDWARDNot a one of us knew what was in 
                         store.

               As his hand moves past the light, weCOME TO:A flashlight SWEEPS past. We are...EXT. FIELD AT THE SWAMP EDGE - NIGHTThe night is WHIRRING and BREATHING, alive. The moon hangs 
               low, casting long shadows.

               Five kids walk past in silhouette. Four have flashlights on. 
               The fifth keeps tripping, crashing into YOUNG EDWARD (10).EDWARDZacky, turn your flashlight on!ZACKYI don't got any batteries!

               Red-headed ZACKY PRICE is 10. His brother DON PRICE is 12, 
               and a lot bigger than the others.DON PRICEThen why'd you bring it?ZACKYI don't want to be in the swamp with 
                         a witch and no flashlight.

               WILBUR FREELY, also 10, is the black asthmatic son of a 
               sharecropper. Redheaded RUTHIE MACKLIN, 8, is happy just to 
               be there.EDWARDIs it true she got a glass eye?WILBUR FREELYI heard she got it from Gypsies.EDWARDWhat's a Gypsy?ZACKYYour momma's a Gypsy.DON PRICEYour momma's a bitch.RUTHIEYou shouldn't swear. There's ladies

               MOVING UP behind the kids, we find ourselves at the gates 
               of...EXT. A CREEPY OLD HOUSE - NIGHTADULT EDWARD (V.O.)Now, it's common knowledge that most 
                         towns of a certain size have a witch, 
                         if only to eat misbehaving children 
                         and the occasional puppy who wanders 
                         into her yard. Witches use those 
                         bones to cast spells and curses that 
                         make the land infertile.

               We PULL BACK, and BACK, revealing more of the Gothically 
               creepy house: its broken windows, strangling vines, and eerie 
               gargoyles half-buried in the dirt. Even bats are afraid to 
               fly over it.

               In the moonlight, the house is especially sinister. Who knows 
               what is lurking in the shadows?ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)Yet of the all the witches in Alabama, 
                         there was one who was the most feared. 
                         For she had one glass eye, which was 
                         said to contain mystical powers.

               We finally come to the kids, staring in through the gate.WILBUR FREELYI hear if you look right at it, you 
                         can see how you're gonna die.EDWARDThat's bull-s-h-i-t, that is. She's 
                         not even a real witch.DON PRICEYou're so sure, why don't you go in 
                         and get that eye? I heard she keeps 
                         it in a box on her nighttable.

               Edward looks back at the spooky house.DON PRICEOr are you too scared?EDWARDI'll go in right now and get that 
                         eye.DON PRICEThen do it.EDWARDFine, I will.DON PRICEFine, you do it.EDWARDFine, I'm doing it.

               He hands Zacky his flashlight, then starts climbing the gate.RUTHIEEdward, don't!WILBUR FREELYShe'll make soap out of you!
                              (to Ruthie)
                         That's what she does, she makes soap 
                         out of people.

               Edward drops down on the far side of the gate. Truth be told, 
               Edward is scared, but he forges ahead anyway.

               Wilbur looks to Ruthie, and they're in complete agreement. 
               They get the hell out of there. Zacky would run too, but Don 
               holds him by the collar.EXT. APPROACHING THE HOUSEEdward curves around the tall bushes that hide the front 
               door. Anything could jump out of them.

               He steps on the porch. The boards SQUEAL and CREAK, but he 
               continues on. A cat SCREAMS OUT from a broken wicker rocker. 
               Catching his breath, Edward reaches the front door.

               The doorknob is ancient brass, two projections that look 
               like horns. Yet Edward extends his hand, reaching closer and 
               closer before he finallyRINGS THE DOORBELL.Impossibly fast, the door opens, revealing an OLD WOMAN with 
               a patch over her left eye. She looks like she's been dead 
               for years, but too stubborn to lie down.EDWARD(calm and

               convinced he's already dead. But suddenly, he's back at the 
               gate.DON PRICEYou get the eye?EDWARDI brought it.DON PRICE(dubious)
                         Let's see it.

               The Old Woman steps out of the shadows behind Edward, flipping 
               up her eye patch. When their flashlight beam hits her left 
               eye, it shines with a hellish glow.

               We RUSH IN on Zacky, who is paralyzed by what he sees.CUT TO:EXT. FRONT PORCH OF HOUSE - DAYAn OLD MAN -- Zacky -- stands on a wobbly stepladder, changing 
               a lightbulb. Suddenly, the ladder gives way and he falls.

               in his eyes.ZACKYI saw how I was gonna die. I was 
                         old, and I fell.DON PRICEI wasn't old at all.

               The brothers suddenly bolt. Still standing next to the Old 
               Woman, Edward smiles.EXT. AT THE OLD WOMAN'S DOOR - NIGHTEdward helps her back inside. He could leave now, but 
               curiosity gets the better of him.EDWARDI was thinking about death and all. 
                         About seeing how you're gonna die.

               The Old Woman turns to him slightly, still not facing him.EDWARDI mean, on one hand, if dying was 
                         all you thought about, it could kind 
                         of screw you up. But it could kind 
                         of help you, couldn't it? Because 
                         you'd know that everything else you 
                         can survive.

               The Old Woman smiles a little, a crooked grin of broken teeth.EDWARDI guess I'm saying, I'd like to know.

               The Old Woman turns leaning her face right in front of his. 
               And on a silent count of one, two, three -- Edward looks 
               into The Eye.

               This time we don't cut. Instead, we HOLD ON Edward as he 
               witnesses his death. He stares transfixed, perplexed and 
               amused. Whatever he sees, it's not as dire as the other boys. 
               His future has something strange in store.EDWARDHuh. That's how I go?

               The Old Woman nods. Still a little overwhelmed, Edward turns 
               and leaves.ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)From that moment on, I no longer 
                         feared death. And for that, I was as 
                         good as immortal.

               As Edward leaves, the door swings SHUT on its own.MATCH CUT TO:INT./EXT. BLOOM HOUSE - (PRESENT) DAYThe front door opens to reveal Will and Josephine on the 
               porch with their bags. REVERSE to Will's mother Sandra (53), 
               surprised and a little annoyed.SANDRAHow did you get here?WILLWe swam. The Atlantic, it's not that 
                         big really.SANDRARuth McHibbon offered to pick you up

               A beat. Starting over...WILLHi, Mom.

               He leans in and hugs her. She surrenders, squeezing her son 
               tight. Will and his mother are cut from the same cloth -- 
               strong-willed but practical. They've always been close.SANDRAI'm so glad you're here.

               That hug finished, Sandra pushes past her son to her daughter-
               in-law. Seeing the size of her belly --SANDRAYou shouldn't have flown. But...

               They hug.JOSEPHINEIt's good to see you. You look 
                         beautiful.

               Josephine squeezes past, a smile to her husband -- be nice. 
               Will heads back to the rental car to retrieve luggage. Sandra 
               follows him.

               Coming down the driveway, we get to see the house for the 
               first time: an older suburban home, three bedrooms, big for 
               the neighborhood, and nicely grown into the lot. KIDS are 
               playing on the street.WILLIs that Dr. Bennett's car?SANDRAHe's up with your father.

               Heading back to the house...WILLHow is he?SANDRAHe's impossible. He won't eat. And 
                         because he won't eat, he gets weaker. 
                         And because he's weaker, he doesn't 
                         want to eat.WILLHow much time does he have left?SANDRAYou don't talk about those things.

               DR. JULIUS BENNETT (85) enters from the foyer, still winded 
               from coming down the stairs. He was the town's first Black 
               physician. He's still the town's best physician.DR. BENNETTWill.WILLDr. Bennett. It's good to see you.

               She smiles, surprised but not doubting. Will looks over -- 
               what did he say? Josephine shakes her head.

               Back to the main subject...SANDRAYou don't think he looks any worse.DR. BENNETTNo. I would say he's the same.

               And in the silence that follows, a lot is said. It wasn't 
               the upbeat reply Sandra was hoping for.WILLCan I see him?DR. BENNETTAbsolutely. Be good for you to talk 
                         to him.

               A moment of awkwardness -- everyone here knows they haven't 
               spoken in years.

               Sandra hands Will a squat can of Ensure from the case on the 
               counter.SANDRAGet him to drink one of these. He 
                         won't, but tell him he has to.INT. FOYER - DAYComing out from the kitchen, Will slowly climbs the stairs. 
               They CREAK with every step.

               The wall is filled with family photos, happier times. Most 
               of the pictures are of Will, starting when he was an infant 
               and ending at his wedding. As he climbs the stairs, we can 
               see him growing up with every step.INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAYA crack of sunlight spills around the half-open door at the 
               end of the hallway. Will walks towards it, running a hand 
               along the wallpaper.

               Almost at the door, he stops for a beat. Gets his breath. 
               Then goes inside.INT. GUEST ROOM - DAYEdward Bloom, 61, lies asleep on the bed. Although he's not 
               the vibrant man we've seen before, it's not as bad we feared. 
               The illness has been quick, and left him largely intact.

               There are no I.V.'s, no monitors, nothing.

               Coming up to the bed --WILLDad?

               Edward cracks open an eye, a beat before he focuses. He tries 
               to say something, but no words come out.

               He looks over at a pitcher on the nightstand. Will pours him 
               a glass of water, helping him hold it to his parched lips.

               Finished, Edward sets down the glass by himself. A very long, 
               tense beat. Will almost speaks again to fill the silence.

               Finally...EDWARDYou --

                         burping and the midnight feedings...WILLDid you do any of that?EDWARDNo, but I hear it's terrible. Then 
                         you spend years trying to corrupt 
                         and mislead this child, fill its

               Will doesn't rise to the challenge. A beat, then he remembers 
               the can of Ensure. Holds it up. Edward recoils.WILLJust drink half the can. I'll tell 
                         her you drank the whole thing. 
                         Everyone wins.

               A beat, then Edward rolls his eyes. Fine. Will cracks open 
               the can, finding a straw on the nightstand.EDWARDPeople needn't worry so much. It's 
                         not my time yet. This isn't how I

                         ruin it for you.

               Edward slurps down as much of the Ensure as he can stand, 
               then pushes the can away. He swallows with difficulty.EDWARDThere was this panhandler who used 
                         to stop me every morning when I came 
                         out of this coffee shop near the

                         me.WILLYou're right.

               Edward gives a wry smile. He walked into that.EDWARDYour mother was worried we wouldn't 
                         talk again. And look at us. We're 
                         talking fine. We're storytellers, 
                         both of us. I speak mine out, you 
                         write yours down. Same thing.

               Will won't commit to Edward's assessment.WILLDad, I'm hoping we can talk about 
                         some things while I'm here.EDWARDYou mean, while I'm here.WILLI'd just like to know the true 
                         versions of things. Events. Stories. 
                         You.

               Edward LAUGHS a little, which becomes a COUGH. The HACKING 
               escalates until another drink of water gets it under control. 
               It's not clear whether any of this was an act to keep from 
               talking.EDWARDYour mother hasn't been keeping up 
                         the pool. If you wanted to you 
                         could...WILLI will.EDWARDYou know where the chemicals are?WILLI used to do it when you were gone, 
                         remember? I used to do it a lot.

               He didn't mean for that to sound so pointed. Taking the half-
               empty Ensure, Will gets up to go. He's at the door when...EDWARDI was never much for being at home, 
                         Will. It's too confining. And this, 
                         here. Being stuck in bed. Dying is 
                         the worst thing that ever happened 
                         to me.

               He smiles at his joke.WILLI thought you weren't dying.EDWARDI said this isn't how I go. The last 
                         part is much more unusual. Trust me 
                         on that.INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAYShutting the door behind himself, Will drinks the rest of 
               the Ensure himself. Edward was right. It tastes horrible.

               Heading for the stairs, Will walks past an open door. As he 
               leaves frame, we STAY BEHIND to look inside...INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - DAY [FLASHBACK]...where an eight-year old Will is propped up in bed, his 
               face covered with chicken pox and pink calamine lotion. He's

                         to be home for a week.EDWARDThat's nothing. I once had to stay

               10 -- sings "Down to the River My Lord" along with the 
               CONGREGATION. His voice is high and thin, but he gives it 
               his all.

               Suddenly, his voice CRACKS and DROPS a half-octave. And then 
               another. His friends Wilbur Freeley and Ruthie look over, 
               wondering what's wrong. Embarrassed, Edward just keeps 
               SINGING, trying to follow along with the baritone part.

               He pulls at his collar. Then pulls again, his face getting 
               red. Starting to panic, he loosens his tie. He's starting to 
               undo the collar button when it POPS off by itself. Two more 
               buttons fly off. One hits a CHUBBY WOMAN in the neck.ON HIS SHOESAs we watch, Edward's pant cuffs rise inch by inch -- that's 
               how fast he's growing.EDWARD (V.O.)Truth is, no one quite knew what was 
                         wrong. Most times, a person grows up 
                         gradually. I found myself in a hurry.INT. YOUNG EDWARD'S BEDROOM - DAYYoung Edward lies in bed, his limbs connected to various 
               pulleys and levers to support his weight. He has a dozen 
               encyclopedias around him, and another dozen on the floor.EDWARD (V.O.)My muscles couldn't keep up with my 
                         bones, and my bones couldn't keep up 
                         with my body's ambition. So I spent 
                         the better part of three years 
                         confined to my bed, with the World 
                         Book Encyclopedia being my only means 
                         of exploration. I had made it all 
                         the way to the "G's," hoping to find 
                         an answer to my gigantificationism, 
                         when I uncovered an article about 
                         the common goldfish.

               INSERT: The encyclopedia article, complete with drawings.YOUNG EDWARD(reading)
                         "Kept in a small bowl, the goldfish 
                         will remain small. With more space, 
                         the fish can grow double, triple, or 
                         quadruple its size."

               Young Edward thinks this through.EDWARD (V.O.)It occurred to me then, that perhaps 
                         the reason for my growth was that I 
                         was intended for larger things. After 
                         all, a giant man can't have an

               Edward is back at the truck, which is painted to read, "Bloom

               the mouth of a cave. Outside, buzzards squabble over the 
               remains of the giant's feast: broken barrels, bones picked 
               clean.

               In his most serious voice, Edward calls out:EDWARDHello!

               There's no answer.EDWARDMy name is Edward Bloom! I want to 
                         talk to you!

               From deep in a cave, a thunderous voice:VOICE (O.S.)GO AWAY!The giant's voice has such force, it blows Edward's hair 
               back.EDWARDI'm not going anywhere until you 
                         show yourself.

               A beat, then we hear a RUMBLE, like a train coming. Edward 
               braces himself, fists ready for a fight, if that's what it's 
               going to take.

               As the RUMBLE gets louder, the ground starts to shake. Even 
               Edward starts to worry. Just how big is this guy?EDWARD (V.O.)Armed with the foreknowledge of my 
                         own death, I knew the giant couldn't 
                         kill me. All the same, I preferred 
                         to keep my bones unbroken.

               Edward picks up a stone, ready to play David to Goliath.

               Then suddenly, the giant bursts forth. Hunched over, he slams 
               into a stunned Edward, knocking him halfway down the hill.

               KARL THE GIANT is bigger than any man you've ever seen. Not 
               just tall, but massive. He's completely feral, with a beard 
               to his elbow and skin scratched and blistered. What remains 
               of his clothes are ragged and muddy. God knows what's living 
               in his matted hair.

               Karl leans over Edward, blocking the sun. Edward throws his 
               rock, but it just bounces off. The giant didn't even notice 
               it.KARLWhy are you here?

               Edward ponders the best response, settling on...EDWARDSo you can eat me. The town decided 
                         to send a human sacrifice, and I 
                         volunteered.

               Karl's eyes narrow, confused. Edward stands up.EDWARDMy arms are a little stringy, but 
                         there's some good eating on my legs. 
                         I mean, I'd be tempted to eat them 
                         myself.
                              (beat)
                         So I guess, just, if you could get 
                         it over with quick. Because I'm not 
                         much for pain, really.

               Edward closes his eyes, hands at his side, ready to be eaten. 
               Karl just stares at him, not sure what to do.

               After a beat, Edward opens his eyes a tiny bit, just to see 
               what the giant is doing. Relieved to see he's not licking 
               his chops --EDWARDLook, I can't go back. I'm a human 
                         sacrifice. If I go back, everyone 
                         will think I'm a coward. And I'd 
                         rather be dinner than a coward.

               Karl sits down with a BOOM, dejected.EDWARDHere, start with my hand. It'll be 
                         an appetizer.

               Reaching up, Edward shoves his hand into Karl's mouth. But 
               the giant spits it back out.KARLI don't want to eat you. I don't 
                         want to eat anybody. It's just I get 
                         so hungry. I'm too big.

               And that's the sad truth. Karl is less a monster than a freak -- 
               a giant man, but in the end, just a man.

               Edward takes a seat beside him.EDWARDDid you ever think maybe you're not 
                         too big? Maybe this town's just too 
                         small. I mean, look at it.

               Circling behind them, we look down at Ashton -- a tiny town 
               in a tiny valley.EDWARDHardly two stories in the whole place. 
                         Now I've heard in real cities, they've 
                         got buildings so tall you can't even 
                         see the tops of 'em.KARLReally?EDWARDWouldn't lie to you. And they've got 
                         all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat 
                         a lot, can't you?KARLI can.EDWARDSo why are you wasting your time in 
                         a small town? You're a big man. You 
                         should be in the big city.

               Karl smiles, but then it fades. A certain sad suspicion --KARLYou're just trying to get me to leave, 
                         aren't you? That's why they sent you 
                         here.EDWARDWhat's your name, Giant?KARLKarl.EDWARDMine's Edward. And truthfully, I do 
                         want you to leave, Karl. But I want

                         open to you.

               Edward ducks a bit so the Mayor can put the key around his 
               neck. The crowd CHEERS. And with that, Edward and Karl start 
               walking, waving as they go.

               Only DON PRICE, smoking on the corner, isn't sad to see Edward 
               go. He crushes his cigarette under his heel. He wishes he 
               could crush Edward.

               Many of the townfolk come onto the street to hug Edward or 
               shake his hand.EDWARD (V.O.)That afternoon as I left Ashton,

                         I held above all others.

               As the crowd parts, he finds himself face to face withTHE OLD WOMAN.The ruckus slows and quiets, as if a strange spell has been 
               cast. She motions for Edward to lean down, so she can whisper 
               something to him. Although we're VERY CLOSE, we can't hear 
               her voice.EDWARD (V.O.)She said that the biggest fish in 
                         the river gets that way by never

               Edward and Karl keep walking. The Old Woman shuffles off, 
               somehow knowing her advice will go unheeded.KARLWhat did she say?EDWARDBeats me.EXT. ROAD - DAYWe TILT UP from the road to reveal Edward and Karl walking 
               out of Ashton. Each wears a backpack with all his earthly 
               possessions.EDWARD (V.O.)There were two roads out of Ashton, 
                         a new one which was paved, and an 
                         older one that wasn't. People didn't 
                         use the old road anymore, and it had 
                         developed the reputation of being 
                         haunted.

               Edward and Karl come to a bend, where the paved road veers 
               left and an overgrown dirt road runs straight. The old road 
               is blocked with signs and warnings of danger.EDWARD (V.O.)Since I had no intention of ever 
                         returning to Ashton, this seemed as 
                         good a time as any to find out what 
                         lay down that old road.

               Karl looks at the dirt road, wary.KARLYou know anyone's who's taken it?EDWARDThat poet, Norther Winslow did. He 
                         was going to Paris, France. He must 
                         have liked it, because no one ever 
                         heard from him again.
                              (beat)
                         Tell you what. You take the other 
                         way and I'll cut through here. Meet 
                         you on the far side.

               A little paranoid...KARLYou're not trying to run away?EDWARDJust to be sure, you can take my 
                         pack.

               Karl perks up, even though it means more for him to carry.EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAYThe road is overgrown, but not altogether creepy. The sun is 
               still shining, and the birds still CHIRPING.

               Spinning the Key to the City, Edward WHISTLES, because it's 
               a day meant for whistling.EXT. FURTHER ALONG - ROUGH PATHThe road has narrowed to a rough path. Spikes of sunlight 
               break through the thick canopy, catching particles in the 
               air. Still, Edward WHISTLES.

               Coming around a bend, his PITCH DROPS as he sees thick, thorny 
               vines growing across the path. He stops. For the first time, 
               he realizes the birds have stopped singing. The forest is 
               dead quiet.

               He looks back the way he came. It's tempting to go back. It 
               would be easier to go back. But Edward presses on.

               He carefully steps through the thorns. His trouser legs catch 
               on the barbs. We can hear the fabric TEAR.FURTHER ALONGA scratched and sweaty Edward waves off various STINGING 
               BUGS flying at him, finally whipping off his hat to swat at 
               them.

               Just then a CAWING crow swoops down and grabs the hat right 
               out of his hands.EDWARDYou stupid sonofa...

               He stops his swearing, but grabs a rock and throws it. The 
               stone ricochets off a tree and into a BEE'S NEST. The swarm 
               roars out.

               Edward high-tails it, each step still precarious.EXT. THE DARK FOREST - DAY [LATER]Edward is bruised, battered and bee-stung.

               A half-broken sign lies in the road. Edward picks it up. 
               Reads it:WARNING!JUMPING SPIDERS!Sure enough, up ahead he sees the path is overgrown with 
               thick cobwebs, heavy from the rain.EDWARD (V.O.)There comes a point where a reasonable 
                         man will swallow his pride and admit 
                         he's made a terrible mistake. The 
                         truth is, I was never a reasonable 
                         man.

               Edward tosses the sign and forges ahead, into the spiderwebs.EDWARDAnd what I recalled of Sunday School 
                         was that the more difficult something 
                         became, the more rewarding it was in 
                         the end.EXT. CLEARING / THE ROAD - DAYEdward emerges from the forest, brushing the last cobwebs 
               off and shaking the spiders from his shirt. One is stuck in 
               his sleeve, and he has to dance to get it out. Even then, he 
               still keeps twitching, convinced another one is left behind.

               At his feet, the gravel road has returned, smooth and dusty 
               and comforting.

               Ahead lies a tiny one-street town -- smaller even than Ashton -- 
               with powerlines emerging from the woods to feed it. Dangling 
               from the line above he sees two dozen pairs of shoes, their 
               laces tied together.

               He passes a sign that reads "Welcome To Spectre!"EXT. THE TOWN OF SPECTRE - DAYIt's a main street with stores on each side: Cole's Pharmacy, 
               Talbot's Five and Dime, Al's Country Store. Everything is 
               old, but this isn't a ghost town. In fact, there's a group 
               of about 20 CITIZENS spilling out to see Edward approach. 
               Most are smiling. There are even a few tears of joy.

               What's more, all of these people are barefoot.MAN'S VOICEFriend!

               A forty-year old man named BEAMEN comes out of the seed store 
               to greet Edward. Friendly but a little drunk, he's the closest 
               thing the town has to a mayor. He's carrying a clipboard.BEAMENWelcome to ya. What's your name?EDWARDEdward Bloom.

               Beamen checks the clipboard. Not finding the name, he flips 
               forward a few pages. Still looking...BEAMENBloom like a flower?EDWARDYes.BEAMENOh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. 
                         We weren't expecting you yet.

               Still confused...EDWARDYou were expecting me?BEAMENNot yet.

               A helpful woman named MILDRED chimes in:MILDREDYou must have taken a shortcut.EDWARDI did. It nearly killed me.BEAMENMmm-hmm. Life'll do that to you. And 
                         truthfully, the long way is easier, 
                         but it's longer.MILDREDMuch longer.BEAMENAnd you're here now, and that's what 
                         matters.

               Beamen's daughter JENNY (8) hides behind her father, peering 
               around to look at the handsome stranger.EDWARDWhat is this place?BEAMENThe town of Spectre. Best kept secret 
                         in Alabama. Says here you're from 
                         Ashton, right? Last person we had 
                         from Ashton was Norther Winslow.EDWARDThe poet? What ever happened to him?BEAMENHe's still here. Let me buy you a 
                         drink. I'll tell you all about it. 
                         Hell, I'll have him tell you.EDWARDNo. I've gotta meet somebody. I'm 
                         already running late.

               He didn't mean it as a joke, but for some reason, everyone's 
               laughing.BEAMENSon, I already told you. You're early.INT. BEAMEN'S HOUSE - DAYSitting at the kitchen table, Edward takes a second slice of 
               apple pie. He and Beamen are joined by NORTHER WINSLOW (30), 
               who fancies himself a cultured artist, though he's never 
               left the state.BEAMENNow tell me if that isn't the best 
                         pie you ever ate.EDWARDIt truly is.UNDER THE TABLEYoung Jenny is stealthily untying the laces on Edward's shoes.NORTHER WINSLOWEverything here tastes better. Even 
                         the water is sweet. Never gets too 
                         hot, too cold, too humid. At night 
                         the wind goes through the trees and 
                         you'd swear there was a whole symphony 
                         out there, playing just for you.

               Suddenly, Jenny YANKS OFF Edward's shoes. She races for the 
               door.EDWARDHey!

               He chases after her.EXT. TOWN / MAIN STREET - DAYAs she runs, Jenny ties Edward's laces together. Reaching 
               the edge of town, she tosses the shoes up and around the 
               power line -- a perfect throw. There's no way he's ever 
               getting them down.

               The gathered citizens of Spectre CHEER for Edward, who is 
               confused and overwhelmed. The women hug him. Men shake his

               Still focused on his shoes...EDWARDWait! I need those!NORTHER WINSLOWThere is no softer ground than town.MILDREDThat rhymes!BEAMENHe is our poet laureate.

               The townsfolk continue to congratulate Edward...EDWARD (V.O.)Sometimes in a dream, you'll visit 
                         places that seem instantly familiar,

               Norther hands him his noteboook.NORTHER WINSLOWI've been working on this poem for 
                         12 years.EDWARDReally.NORTHER WINSLOWThere's a lot of expectation. I don't 
                         want to disappoint my fans.

               A beat.EDWARDIt's only three lines long.

               Norther grabs his notebook back.NORTHER WINSLOWThis is why you don't show work in 
                         progress.EDWARDNorther, do you ever regret not making

                         than here.EDWARDYou're a poet. You oughta be able 
                         to. And maybe if you'd seen more, 
                         you could.

               Norther doesn't answer. Just goes back to his notebook.EXT. BY THE RIVER - NIGHTBy the light of the full moon, Edward soaks his feet in the 
               water, trying to make sense of it all. The Key to the City 
               dangles around his neck.

               He stares at himself in the reflection. He smiles.

               It's then that a WOMAN emerges at the far side of the river.

               No telling where she came from -- she must have been swimming 
               underwater. We never see her face.

               She stands in the river with her bare back to Edward, 
               squeezing the water out of her golden hair, oblivious to his 
               presence. Edward is breathless. It's the first woman he's 
               seen in her natural state, and he doesn't dare move lest he 
               frighten her away.

               Then he sees the snake.

               It's a cottonmouth, has to be. It leaves a break in the water, 
               its small reptilian head aiming for her flesh.

               There's no decision to be made. On pure instinct, Edward 
               dives in. He swims as hard as can,GRABBING THE SNAKEjust as it's about to strike.

               The woman dives back underwater, understandably terrified 
               that a man is coming at her.EDWARDNo, it's okay! I got it. I got the 
                         snake.

               As the splashing subsides, Edward looks at what he holds in 
               his hands. Which isn't a snake at all, but rather a common 
               stick. And a non-threatening one at that.

               While Edward ponders his mistake, he looks around to discover 
               that the Girl in the River is gone. He never even saw her 
               face.EDWARDWait! I'm sorry. Hello?!

               Edward keeps expecting her to surface, somewhere, but she 
               never does. He stands alone in the river, wondering what 
               tricks his eyes are playing on him.EXT. BY THE RIVER - NIGHT - CONTINUOUSA GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)There's leeches in there!

               Edward looks to the bank, where young Jenny Hill is watching 
               him.EDWARDDid you see that woman?JENNYWhat did she look like?EDWARDWell, she... uh...JENNYWas she nekkid?

               Embarrassed to admit it...EDWARDYeah.JENNY(matter-of-fact)
                         It's not a woman, it's a fish. No 
                         one ever catches her.

               Given the day he's had so far, Edward isn't inclined to follow 
               up on the issue. He starts to wade back to the bank.JENNY (CONT'D)Fish looks diff'rent to diff'rent 
                         people. My daddy said it looked like 
                         the coon dog he had when he was kid, 
                         back from the dead.

               Edward climbs up onto the shore, completely drenched. He 
               pulls up his pant legs to reveal three shiny leeches clinging 
               to his skin.EDWARDShoot.

               He starts to work pulling them off.EXT. PATH BACK TO TOWN - NIGHTEdward and Jenny walk back.JENNYHow old are you?EDWARDEighteen.JENNYI'm eight. That means when I'm 
                         eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 
                         28, you'll only be 38.EDWARD(a little wary)
                         You're pretty good at arithmetic.JENNYAnd when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And 
                         that's not much difference at all.

               Eager to get off this subject...EDWARDSure is a lot now, though, huh?EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHTAs Edward and Jenny approach Main Street, they find "downtown" 
               has been transformed. Lanterns and streamers hang on cables 
               across the street, and a small stage has been built at one 
               end to hold FIDDLERS.

               The whole town is there in celebration of its newest citizen, 
               Edward Bloom. Before he can protest, two WOMEN have grabbed 
               him by the arms, pulling him in to dance with them.

               The resulting dance number seems both choreographed and 
               complete chaos. From FARMER to BAKER'S WIFE, everyone wants 
               to dance with Edward, who finds himself tossed around like a 
               stick caught in a whirlpool. Still, he's having a blast.

               Jenny grabs both his hands, and they spin wildly.

               Beamen plucks his LAUGHING daughter away to dance with her.

               Then Mildred cuts in to dance with Edward. It's hard to hear 
               over the MUSIC.MILDREDJenny thinks you're quite a catch. 
                         We all do.EDWARD(not hearing)
                         What?MILDREDI said you're quite a catch!

               Edward stops dancing. A beat, then he heads for the edge of 
               the crowd. Beamen is there, with Jenny on his shoulders.EDWARDI have to leave. Tonight.BEAMENWhy?EDWARDThis town is everything a man could 
                         ask for. And if I were to end up 
                         here, I'd consider myself lucky. But 
                         the fact is, I'm not ready to end up 
                         anywhere.BEAMENNo one's ever left.JENNYHow are you gonna make it without 
                         your shoes?EDWARDI suspect it will hurt a lot.

               And with that, Edward walks down Main Street. The townspeople 
               stop dancing, disbelieving, some shaking their heads.

               Poor Edward Bloom's gone crazy.BEAMEN(calling after him)
                         You won't find a better place!EDWARDI don't expect to.

               Jenny runs to him. She'd tackle him if she could.JENNYPromise me you'll come back.EDWARDI promise. Someday. When I'm really 
                         supposed to.

               It's not good enough, but it will have to do. Edward keeps 
               walking.EXT. THE DARK FOREST - NIGHTVARIOUS SHOTS: Edward negotiates the thorns in his bare feet. 
               It's horrible. Almost unendurable.

               And then it gets worse.

               The trees ahead are moving. At first, it just seems to be 
               the wind blowing the branches, but as we hear the wood 
               CRACKING and GROANING, there's no mistaking it: they're trying 
               to block him.

               Snake-like WHITE ROOTS shoot out of the ground, grabbing for 
               his ankles. He leaps up, kicking off one tree trunk to grab 
               another one's branches. He swings off, lands and rolls. Now 
               all the trees are moving to block him, their dark shapes 
               towering over him in the flashes of LIGHTNING.EDWARD (V.O.)As difficult as it was to reach 
                         Spectre, I was fated to get there 
                         eventually. After all, no man can 
                         avoid reaching the end of his life.

               As he ducks under branches, the chain holding the Key to the 
               City gets caught. He's almost strangled, but the chain finally 
               breaks. The silver key disappears into the mud.

               Scrambling forward, he looks for a way out. But the trees

               The carnies back away from the ball as a deep DRUM ROLL 
               begins. A moment, then the ball starts to bulge from inside.

               A foot suddenly bursts out from within. GASPS from the crowd. 
               That foot is massive. In the stands, Edward looks closer. 
               Intrigued.

               As the drum beat intensifies, a second foot breaks out. 
               Followed by hands. Shoulders. Finally, the head. This isCOLOSSUS.From a very LOW ANGLE, we look up to see just how massive he 
               is. He seems to fill the Heavens. With his shaved head and 
               giant club, he seems more ogre than man.

               In the bandstands, a YOUNG BOY's jaw drops in awe. Colossus 
               walks down the row, letting the crowd get a better look at 
               him. Some reach out to touch him, disbelieving. A tight 
               spotlight follows him, revealing faces in the crowd.

               Colossus passes Edward, who seems unimpressed. He leans with 
               the spotlight, WHISTLING to get the big man's attention.

               He points to the edge of the stands, where his friend is

               ANGLE ON Colossus, realizing the gig is up. With a resigned

               The two make eye contact. And as they do, all motion FREEZES.

               A fiery baton remains mid-twirl, flames locked in place. A 
               spilled box of popcorn hangs in mid-air, each kernel like a

               Only Edward is free to move, winding his way between the

               the side, and as we PULL BACK, we see why: he's holding it 
               in a MASSIVE LION's open mouth. The beast's sharp teeth are 
               just poking his skin. If the lion so much as flinches, Edward 
               is dead.

               The CROWD applauds, which makes the lion antsy. Which makes 
               Edward antsier.EDWARD (V.O.)From that moment on, I did everything 
                         Mr. Calloway asked, and a lot of 
                         things he didn't. I'd go three days

               Nodding off, Edward falls backward, into the path of the 
               spinning arms. One of the Hydra cars hits him square in the 
               gut, throwing him up and away, sailing 200 feet through the

               To the left, CUSTOMERS are shooting with rifles. He dodges 
               four SHOTS that knock down the birds around him.

               He catches his breath, lucky.

                         need to talk to you.

               Suddenly, the rocking and moaning stop. A beat, then the 
               door handle begins to RATTLE. It seems to be stuck.

               Edward turns the knob.

               Suddenly, the door BURSTS OPEN. Edward is knocked down by a 
               massive black dog, biggest you've ever seen. It has green 
               glowing eyes and a lick of fire for a tongue.

               Edward wrestles with the beast, its mouth snapping at his 
               throat. 

               Blocking with an arm, Edward tries to push himself free, but 
               the creature's hands -- it has hands instead of paws -- hold 
               on tight.

               Entwined, they roll across the dirt. The other nearby CARNIES 
               scatter for cover. Mr. Soggybottom pulls a revolver out of 
               his clown suit. Loads a silver bullet.

               Edward finally succeeds in throwing the beast off. He rolls 
               to his feet.

               The hell hound squares back on its haunches, GROWLING, ready 
               for another leap. Mr. Soggybottom sheds a clown tear, aiming 
               the revolver at the dog.

               At the last moment...EDWARDNo, wait!

               Edward moves just as Mr. Soggybottom FIRES. The bullet catches 
               Edward in the shoulder, knocking him down.

               The carnies GASP.

               Licking its chops, the dog approaches the helpless Edward, 
               who feels the ground around him, looking for some kind of 
               weapon. He finds only a small stick. He waves it at the dog, 
               ready to strike it.

               Like magic, the dog's whole demeanor changes. It bounces 
               excitedly, ready to play fetch.

               Seeing an opportunity, Edward throws the stick as far as he 
               can. The dog bounds after it,SMASHING DOWN THREE CARS.It returns a beat later with the flaming stick, which it

               along with the rest of the town's.JENNY (V.O.)A man sees things differently at 
                         different times in his life. This 
                         town didn't seem the same now that 
                         he was older.EXT. TOWN OF SPECTRE - VARIOUS SHOTSWe look around the town, on and off Main Street. There are 
               "FOR SALE" signs in many of the windowsJENNY (V.O.)A new road had brought the outside 
                         world to Spectre, and with it, banks, 
                         liens and debt. Almost everywhere 
                         you looked, people were bankrupt.EXT. SPECTRE - DAYWe slowly MOVE THROUGH a foreclosure auction to find Edward 
               watching. Two very corporate MEN IN SUITS, stick out among 
               the bidders.JENNY (V.O.)Two different corporations were 
                         looking at buying the town, if they 
                         could get the price low enough. One 
                         wanted to open a chicken processing 
                         plant. The other, a municipal dump. 
                         Either way, Spectre would be 
                         destroyed.

               Edward raises his hand.EDWARDFifty-thousand!

               Everyone turns to look at this new bidder.JENNY (V.O.)And so Edward Bloom decided to buy 
                         the town, in order to save it.INT. NORTHER WINSLOW'S MANHATTAN - DAYEdward pitches his plan to Norther.JENNY (V.O.)He was never a wealthy man, but he 
                         had made other men rich, and now he 
                         asked for their favors.INT./EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAYVARIOUS SHOTS: Expressive and passionate as always, Edward 
               talks to Ping, Jing and Amos Calloway.JENNY (V.O.)Most of them had never seen Spectre -- 
                         they only had Edward's words to 
                         describe it. That's all they needed. 
                         He sold them on the dream.JINGYou can structure it as a historical 
                         trust. But you'll need every 
                         contiguous piece of property. It's 
                         all or nothing.

               As Edward takes notes...JENNY (V.O.)So first he bought the farms. Then 
                         he bought the houses. Then he bought 
                         the stores.INT. AL'S COUNTRY - DAYFinishing up with AL, Edward shakes hands.JENNY (V.O.)Whatever he bought, the people were 
                         not asked to leave or pay rent or 
                         anything. They were just asked to 
                         keep doing as they were doing. In 
                         that way, he could make sure the 
                         town would never die.EXT. ROAD IN THE SWAMP - DAYEdward climbs out of his car, the road having literally 
               stopped. The sun is shining, but it can barely penetrate the 
               trees' thick canopy.JENNY (V.O.)Within six months, his trust had 
                         purchased the entire town. With one 
                         exception.

               In the distance, he sees a shack, so old it's nearly fallen. 
               He walks toward it, the marshy ground SQUISHING up around 
               his feet, soaking the hems of his trousers.

               We hear a PIANO playing from inside the shack. Edward KNOCKS 
               on the half-hung door, which swings open by itself.INT. SHACK - DAYThe inside is nicer than you'd think, a real home. A fire 
               burns in the stove, and curtains hang in the windows.

               With her back turned to him, Jenny Hill plays the piano. 
               Edward doesn't recognize her as the little girl who used to 
               have a crush on him. Without turning, she says...JENNYYou must be Edward Bloom.EDWARDHow did you know?

               She keeps PLAYING.JENNYNo one would come out here unless 
                         they had business. And no one would 
                         have business with me except for 
                         you. You're buying the town.EDWARDApparently I've overlooked this one 
                         piece of it, and I'd like to remedy 
                         that. You see, in order for the town 
                         to be preserved, the trust must own 
                         it in its entirety.JENNYSo I've heard.EDWARDI'll offer you more than it's worth. 
                         And you know you won't have to move. 
                         Nothing will change except the name 
                         on the deed, you have my word.

               Jenny stops playing, her piece not quite finished. She turns 
               to face him. Edward still doesn't recognize her.JENNYNow let me get this straight. You'll 
                         buy the swamp from me, but I'll stay 
                         in it. You'll own the house, but 
                         it'll still be mine. I'll be here, 
                         and you'll come and go as you please 
                         to one place or another. Do I have 
                         that right?

               Strange to hear it put that way, but --EDWARDIn so many words, yes.JENNYThen I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If 
                         nothing is going to change, I'd just 
                         as soon it not change in the way it 
                         hasn't been changing all this time.EDWARDIt's not like you're going to lose 
                         anything. You can ask anyone in town. 
                         I've been nothing if not generous. I 
                         want the best for everyone.

               A long beat.JENNYMr. Bloom, why are you buying this 
                         land? Some sort of midlife crisis? 
                         Instead of buying a convertible, you 
                         buy a town?

               He looks at her, puzzled and surprised. No one has really 
               asked before.EDWARDHelping people makes me happy.JENNYI'm not convinced you should be happy.EDWARDI'm sorry. Have I offended you?

               She finally turns to face him.JENNYNo, you did exactly what you promised. 
                         You came back. I was just expecting 
                         you sooner.FLASHBACK TO:EXT. SPECTRE - NIGHTYoung Jenny Hill watches barefoot Edward leave Spectre for 
               the first time.BACK TO:INT. SHACK - DAYFinally realizing who this woman is...EDWARDYou're Beamen's daughter. Your last 
                         name is different.

                         was a big difference.

               Before he can say anything more...JENNYI won't be selling you this house, 
                         Mr. Bloom.EDWARDI see. I thank you for your time.

               A bit bewildered, Edward tips his hat to her as he leaves.EXT/INT. SWAMP SHACK - DAYEdward pulls the door shut behind him as he leaves, but it 
               breaks off in his hands. It's not the clean exit he was hoping 
               for.

               Inside Jenny looks out, surprised and annoyed.

               Edward tries to lift the door back on the hinges, but they 
               SNAP off. The door frame buckles and the whole shack CREAKS.EDWARDI'm sorry.

               He tries to lean the door against the frame, but it keeps 
               slipping.JENNYIt's okay, just leave it.EDWARDI can get it. I can just...

               He leans the door a different way. It holds for a beat then 
               falls in, SMASHING a small table.EDWARDLord, I'm sorry I...JENNYPlease. Go. Just go.EDWARDI'll...JENNYGo.

               She's dead serious. Weighing the scales of chivalry, he 
               finally backs away. Turns and heads back towards his car.

               We STAY ON Jenny, watching him go. She's furious, but there's 
               something more in her feelings for him. Something softer.JENNY (V.O.)Most men in that situation would 
                         accept their failure and move on. 
                         But Edward was not like most men.EXT. SWAMP SHACK ROAD - ANOTHER DAYWith Karl the Giant's help, Edward unloads a brand new door 
               from a pickup truck.EXT. SHACK - DAYWhile Jenny watches, half-annoyed, half-amused, Edward tries 
               to set the door square. Karl pushes against the side of the 
               house until it fits.INT. SHACK - ANOTHER DAYHolding nails between his lips, Edward puts in new windows 
               himself. Jenny is making soup, laughing at the story he's 
               telling.JENNY (V.O.)As the months passed, he found more 
                         and more things to fix, until the 
                         shack no longer resembled itself.EXT. SWAMP - ANOTHER DAYEdward and Karl cut down a tree, letting in a flood of light.

               Through the golden pollen hanging in the air, we RISE UP to 
               see the shack is nowTHE LOVELY HOUSEwe saw before. It's tiny and white, with black shutters and 
               a steep roof. A white picket fence. In every detail it is 
               impossibly charming.INT. JENNY'S HOUSE - DAYEdward is screwing a hat rack into the wall in the foyer. 
               Jenny leans against the doorframe listening to his story. 
               And watching him with deepest affection.EDWARDOf course, the best part was creating 
                         new material. By the time the twins 
                         and I got to Havana, we had a whole 
                         new routine worked out for them, 
                         with just a ukulele and a harmonica.

               Finished with his work, he takes his hat off the chair and 
               hangs it on the rack. Perfect.

               A beat. A look between them. With that last job done, there's 
               no reason for him to be staying any longer.EDWARDI suppose I should...

               He takes his hat off the rack.JENNYYou can leave it there.

               A beat. Does she really mean it?

               She comes closer. Edward holds his ground. She takes his 
               hand, lifting his hat up to the peg. She's very close -- 
               just a half-inch from kissing him when --

               -- Edward gently holds her back.EDWARDNo.

               She freezes, stunned and humiliated. She pulls away.EDWARDDon't. Don't be embarrassed. I should

               He climbs in his car and starts the engine.EXT. JENNY HILL'S HOUSE - DAY TO NIGHTAs we watch, the swamp begins to overtake the house, 
               swallowing it in a tangle of vines and mossy branches.

               Shoots burst up through the planks in the porch. Snakes 
               slither through the marsh.

               Day becomes night.JENNY (V.O.)As for the girl, the common belief 
                         was that she'd become a witch, and 
                         crazy at that. She became something 
                         of a legend herself.

               We REVERSE to find FOUR KIDS looking in through the rusty

                         young.JENNYNo, it's logical if you think like 
                         your father. See, to him, there's 
                         only two women: your mother and

                         never love me back. I was living in 
                         a fairy tale.

               Will smiles to hear it called that.JENNYPeople aren't like they are in 
                         stories. They hurt each other without 
                         meaning to. They are kind and 
                         unbelievably cruel at the same moment.

               holds it. There's nothing else to do.

               Edward looks around, confused and increasingly scared. He 
               sees the end approaching, but doesn't know exactly what's

               Strangely, he's gotten even lighter. Will carries him easily.

               to see she's already standing in the river beside them.

               The reflection of the light off the water gives Sandra an

               Will is there to witness.

               As the kiss ends, Edward tries to pull off his wedding ring.

               expected.

               As his mother talks to a WELL-WISHER, Will looks left to see 
               an Oldsmobile parking.

               CLOSE ON the license plates. Missouri.

               The passenger side opens, but the man who steps out is barely 
               visible over the door. He shuts it to reveal himself to be70.It's Amos Calloway. Will doesn't recognize him.

               The Driver climbs out, a size 15 foot on the gravel. We TILT 
               UP to see this man is huge.

               This man is KARL, now 55. He's not 12 feet tall, but at least 
               six-eight.

               CLOSE ON Will, bewildered to see that this man really exists.EXT. CEMETERY / GRAVESIDE - DAYAs the service gets ready to begin, Will guides his mother 
               to a seat near the grave.

               Sitting beside Will, Josephine spots a stunning ASIAN WOMAN 
               (50) behind them. A beat later, an identical face with glasses 
               peers out -- the woman's twin sister.

               It's PING and JING.

               Josephine almost GASPS. She elbows Will, who turns to look. 
               From this angle the sisters seem conjoined, but then Jing 
               steps forward. They're really two separate people. 

               A sea of familiar faces, all of them aged through the years: 
               BEAMEN, NORTHER WINSLOW, the MAYOR, and ZACKY PRICE.EXT. CEMETERY - DAY [LATER]After the service, we see the crowd gathered in small groups. 
               By the LAUGHTER and hand gestures, we can see they're telling 
               stories. They're telling Edward's stories.

               We find Will watching them.WILL (V.O.)Have you ever heard a joke so many 
                         times you've forgotten why it's funny? 
                         But then you hear it again and 
                         suddenly it's new. You remember why 
                         you loved it in the first place.

               Will joins in, laughing.
