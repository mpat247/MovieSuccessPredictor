          Should I ask her about Korea? Maybe
          have her point it out to us on a
          globe? I don't understand the young
          talent in this town! It doesn't make
          any sense. I got four jobs. Hell, I'm
          more famous than half the people we
          talk to anyway! No one stands up. No
          one has the balls to sit them down and
          say, "Look, just cut the shit."But
          everybody works for `em. They're all
          on the payroll. They're all sucking
          the teat! Nobody sits `em down, eye-to-
          eye, one-on-one, and says... "Cut the
          shit." And all these stars just to
          fuck it up. That's what they do. They
          fuck my day up! And it pisses me off!
