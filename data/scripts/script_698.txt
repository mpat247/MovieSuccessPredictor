"The Limey," production draft, by Lem DobbsTHE LIMEYbyLEM DOBBSdraft 08/03/98NOTE:  THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS.THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THIS SOFT COPY.Wilson's first impression of Los Angeles was blue.  He was in
     the sky at the time, so it was a curious reversal, looking
     down rather than up at the color he had always felt was
     nature's finest.

     Swimming pools.  Hundreds of them.  Pockmarking the landscape
     like miniature lakes.  A flat landscape of straight streets
     and square blocks and sparse grass that didn't look quite
     green enough.

     As far as Wilson could remember, he had only ever seen seven
     or eight swimming pools in his entire life and they had been
     public ones.  Here everyone had their own.  Marvellous.

     There was the one at the Butlin's holiday camp where he had
     enjoyed his last legitimate employment -- as driver of a tour
     bus.  And there was the one at Crystal Palace he had gone to
     once or twice when he was younger.  He was most familiar,
     though, with the Chelsea Baths as he had lived for some time
     in a flat nearby in what he now thought of as his good years
     -- before he'd gone grey, went to prison, and found himself in
     a plane over a foreign town arriving to avenge the death of
     his daughter.










     WHOOSH!  The sound of automatic doors opening and --EXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL.  L.A. AIRPORT.  AFTERNOON.WILSON steps out into the late sunlight and the heat of the
     day.  A slow-motion moment while he gets acclimatized.  He
     wouldn't have ever felt quite this kind of heat before.
     After such a rigorously air-conditioned interior.  Or seen
     cops wearing guns on their belts.  Or black cops, for that
     matter, with guns on their belts.  Or seen people as fat as
     Americans on their home turf.  Things someone from England
     notices immediately, whether consciously at first or not.CUT.EXT. MOTEL.  EVENING.Wilson's not here for comfort.  Shown to a shitty room, round
     the corner of a typical 2nd-level outside walkway.  Airport
     close by.INT. MOTEL ROOM.  EVENING.He draws a curtain open across a window in one strong easy
     glide.  His moves are neat.  His expressions just as
     economical, not giving much away.  Outside the planes are
     practically on top of us. The sunset colors strange and
     chemical.

     He's only got one light bag.  Unzips, unpacks a few things.
     Change of clothes, a travel kit, and some familiar items
     (shaving foam/toothpaste/deodorant} bearing unfamiliar
     British brand names.

     Goes into the bathroom.  Turns on the shower in there.

     Comes back to sit on the bed.  Takes an envelope out of his
     jacket.ENVELOPETurns it over to see the return address on the back.CUT.INT. TAXI.  NIGHT.Wilson in the back.  Stares at the impenetrable name on the
     driver's posted ID. Glances at the driver.

     DRIVER glances back at his quiet passenger in the rearview
     mirror.CUT.EXT. SMALL HOUSE.  NIGHT.Wilson walks up a cracked little path to the front door.
     Lower middle-class street.  Two cars in the driveway, one
     behind the other.  Lights on inside the house -- as he rings
     the bell.ED RAMAAnswers it.  Hispanic.  Late 30's.  Chairman Mao on his T-
     shirt notwithstanding, an easygoing sort of fellow.  Not
     looking for any trouble -- anymore.  But once did, and able
     to handle himself if any shows up.  Which it has.WILSONEdward Rama?EDEduardo.
                   (rolling the R)
               Rama.WILSONYou're home, then.

     He turns, waves away the taxi he's kept waiting.  While
     Eduardo Rama waits for an introduction.WILSONMy name's Wilson.

     Accent speaks for itself.  Hard, working-class.EDWilson?

     Knows the name.  But just now it's unexpected.  He's holding
     a hot TV dinner, hand protected by a dish towel.WILSONYou wrote to me about my daughter.CUT.INT. ED'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.Ed takes Wilson inside.EDI didn't expect anyone.WILSONNo reason.EDI mean, what has it been -- six months?WILSONRound about, yeah.

     They've entered a cauldron of family life.  TV blaring
     (SHOWBIZ TONIGHT!).  A couple of younger KIDS yelling "Mama".
     Their MOTHER shouting back at them from the kitchen (in
     Spanish) that she only has two hands.  A sullen TEENAGER
     walking by.EDI didn't even know who I was writing to --
               just someone with the same last name.
               She never talked about any family.WILSONIt was better than a telegram.

     Ed opens a screen door to the backyard.EXT. ED'S BACKYARD.  NIGHT.They sit at an outdoor table.  Wilson with a TV dinner in
     front of him now too.  Sounds from inside MUTED.  Even this
     little house has a little pool.WILSONWho done it, then?EDHuh?WILSONSnuffed her.

     Ed surprised at Wilson's directness.  Ed stands nervously.EDNow, wait up a second, man.

     And paces back and forth.EDI never said nothin' about nothin' like
               that.  No, no, no.  That's not what I
               wrote to you.WILSONNo, but between the lines, eh?
               Mysterious circumstances, and that.

     Ed stops pacing.EDLook, I sent you that newspaper clipping,
               all right?  I told you what I know.  It
               was an accident.  I didn't say anything
               about anybody being "snuffed."

     Beat.WILSONThis bloke she was bunked up with.  This
               Terry what'sit.EDTerry Valentine.WILSONValentine.  What's he got to say for
               himself?EDI dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had
               a fight that night, she drove away, she
               was upset?  I don't even know the guy.
               Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were
               friends, but we didn't travel in the same
               social circles.  She had her life, I had
               mine.

     Makes a kind of scoffing gesture:  and you can see what my
     life is.EDValentine came into the restaurant where
               I work with Jenny a couple times.  He's a
               money guy.  Jenny would say, hey, here's
               my friend Eddie and he would shake my
               hand and everything, but he wouldn't even
               see me, you know what I mean.

     Wilson gazes up at the sky.  Clear night.  Stars.WILSONHow long had she been in the States?
                   (as if to himself, somewhat
                    wistful)
               Near on ten years, wasn't it?  Long
               enough to know her way about, I reckon.

     Ed leans down, palms on the tabletop, facing Wilson.EDThere was an investigation, okay?  The
               car was totalled.  Jennifer was ... Her
               neck was broken.  On impact, they said.
               So she wouldn't have ... felt the effects
               of the fire.
                   (helpless shrug)
               It happens up there.  Happens a lot.
               What more can I tell you.

     Wilson taps out a cigarette from a pack of "Silk Cut" he's
     produced from his pocket.WILSONWhat more is there.EDI'm just sayin' -- it was a steep
               hillside.  There was no moon that
               night ...

     Wilson's quiet stillness is getting to him.EDCoulda happened to anyone, man.  I never
               knew her to be reckless.  I mean, sure,
               she would smoke a little grass, or
               something, have a few drinks.  But that's
               it, nothing more than that.WILSONNo, not my girl.  Self-control, she had.
               Point of pride.
                   (smokes)
               And people don't change, do they.EDI dunno ... Maybe they do.

     Wilson notes the tattoos on Ed's forearms.WILSONGoing straight, are ya.

     Ed looks at him.  Sits down again.  Keeping his forearms under
     the table.ED(looks away)
               Boomerang.WILSONY'what?EDI knew when I was droppin' that letter
               into the mail slot it was gonna come back
               and smack me in the face.
                   (looks at Wilson again)
               I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol'
               man's up in Chino right now doin' eight
               years.WILSON(re the family inside)
               This ain't your lot?EDYou kiddin', man?  I don't need a wife
               and screamin' kids.  I still got my
               youth.

     And yet -- he lives here.  Wilson declines to pursue the
     matter.EDI go to work, try to keep my life
               together, put all that shit behind me,
               man.  What d'you want from me.WILSON(calmly smoking)
               I only asked.

     Ed sighs.  Reaches for one of Wilson's cigarettes.EDCouple weeks before she died, Jennifer
               asked me to drive her downtown.  Said she
               was meeting -- her boyfriend --
               Valentine.  But I think she was looking
               for him.FLASH CUTS:

     ED AND JENNIFER. In a car, downtown. She has the same steely
     intensity as her father. Ed looks a little worried.WILSON(lighting Ed's cigarette)
               What, tryin' to catch him with another
               bird?EDThat's what I thought, man.  But it was
               not a hotel or nothin' that we went to.
               It was someplace else.WILSONWhere abouts?FLASH CUTS:

     JENNIFER. Talking to a beefy SUPERVISOR. Or talking at him.
     Either way, he isn't happy.

     MEAT PUPPETS. Watch instead of working.

     ED. Taking all this in.EDBad place, man.  Bad people.  Some guys
               loading some trucks.  Some kinda deal
               goin' down.
                   (anticipating Wilson's next
                    question)
               I don't know and I don't care.  Maybe
               they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos.WILSONDid Jenny know?ED(shrugs)
               Valentine wasn't even there.  If he was

                   (stands up again)
               But I'll tell you something.  She stood

     Unconsciously rubbing his arms where his tattoos are.EDI drove her back to Valentine's house.FLASH CUT:

     VALENTINE. Standing in front of his house. His expression
     says: We have something to discuss.EDHe was standing outside waiting for her.

               Those curves don't kid around.

     Could be talking about the girl.  Wilson doesn't move.  But
     touch him, he'll explode.  Out the window lights are passing,
     but no landmarks.  He might as well be on the moon.EDYou should talk to Elaine.  That was her
               best friend.WILSONShe didn't write to me, did she.EDShe didn't know what to say.
                   (shrugs)
               I thought someone should say something.
               To someone.  With me it was, I don't know
               -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I
               felt like I owed her.WILSONWho'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass
               or whatever?ED(self-conscious again)

               likely -- for gettin' caught.EDBut that's not me anymore.  That's when I
               was into the gang lifestyle.  That's not

               that's it for me, man.

     of it besides a sense of Wilson -- cool cat; ambling along;
     loner; sun beating down; not bothered; his shadow doubling
     him -- is this:

     The building approaching.  The one he has his eye on.  The
     target.  It's across the street.  A kind of flat windowless
     warehouse with adjoining loading yard.  Loading yard
     surrounded by a chain-link fence -- topped with barbed wire.

     The actual geography of where he left his car in relation to
     this building.  Safely around the corner.  And how he might
     practically get back to it, either this same way or via a
     more circuitous route round another block.

     afternoon that you're in a ghost town.  Particularly in this
     shabby kind of industrial section.EXT. THE BUILDING.Wilson crosses over to it now.  From sunny to shade.

     Walks past the chain-link fence.  The padlocked gate, big
     enough to accommodate the (couple of) trucks parked within
     the compound.

     Walks past the closed security door which would appear to be
     the building's main entrance.

     Round the next corner -- SEES there's a steel back door as
     well.

     now.  Streets here utterly deserted.  Not even a passing car.
     Crappy residential building on an opposite corner, SPANISH
     MUSIC blaring from one of the open windows, but not with a
     direct view on the loading yard fence on this side.  Wilson
     nearing it now -- taking something out of his pocket.  One of
     the mysterious metallic tools from his travel kit.  Snaps his
     wrist, unfolding the tool with a CRACK.  Wire cutters.

     He doesn't go for the gate, the padlock, like we might have
     thought.  He suddenly drops to one knee, in shadow where the
     fence meets the adjoining building.  SNAP, SNAP, SNAP, SNAP,
     SNAP -- so quick, with great dexterity, though his face
     grimaces with the strength he has to exert with each
     application of pressure -- he cuts just as many links as he
     knows he needs to push in a little flap of fence and roll
     under.  Whole thing accomplished in seconds.LOADING YARDWalks fast to the cover of the trucks.  Passes.  Looks

     Gordon coming towards him.  As if to challenge Wilson's
     legitimacy as an invited guest.  Closer.  About to speak.

     But Wilson doesn't even give him a chance to do that.  In
     quick succession:  Wilson HEAD BUTTS Gordon, splintering his
     nose; KNEES him in the groin; then, using the knee for
     leverage, grabs Gordon by the lapels -- and heaves him over
     the railing!

     STACY is his name.  A shrewd, scheming kid.  But definitely a
     little unhinged.  Weirder is his companion.  UNCLE JOHN.  The

     front of him toward where he last saw Uncle John's
     silhouette.LIVING AREATom runs through and reaches the sliding doors to the back

     forward but is stopped by a bullet in the chest (about the
     only clean shot anybody makes).  He looks down at himself.UNCLE JOHNShit.

     He looks up to SEE:AVERYNear death.  Gun in his good hand.  He squeezes the trigger
     again.UNCLE JOHNA small black hole appears in his cheek.  He blinks, begins
     to raise his hand to his face, and collapses.AVERYExhales and rolls over.TOMStill trying to get to his feet.  He gives up and just lies

     from Ed.ADHARAWhere are you going?LIVING ROOMValentine runs to the sliding door, smack into:WILSONStanding there.  Wet.  Mad.  He grabs Valentine by the shirt
     and pushes him back into the room.VALENTINEBounces off the couch and onto the floor.WILSONComes toward him.VALENTINEGrabs a lamp off an end table and hurls it at Wilson.  It

     suddenly he screams instead.WILSONAAAAGGGGHHHH!ADHARAHas just stuck a kitchen knife into Wilson's back.WILSONTurns instinctively and whips the pistol around, smashing
     Adhara in the mouth.ADHARAHits the ground.  She won't be retaliating.WILSONIn agony, spinning, trying to reach the knife in his back,
     but IT'S JUST BEYOND HIS REACH.VALENTINEScrambles through the sliding glass door.EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  BACK PORCH.  NIGHT.Valentine stumbles out.  Notices Avery slumped on the deck,
     mortally wounded.  Goes to him -- as if concerned -- but
     actually just to take the gun.  Then runs off the porch
     toward the STEPS that lead down to the sea.WILSONComes out after him, the knife still in his back.  So intent
     on catching Valentine he fails at first to notice Avery lying
     in the shadows.AVERYHas just barely managed to reach Stacy's pistol.  Raises it
     weakly.  Points it at Wilson.WILSONSeems to feel it.  Turns.  Locks eyes with Avery.  Avery
     could already have shot him.  But there's a momentary sense of
     recognition:  both of them just foot soldiers for fat cats --
     and Avery's is not worth saving.AVERYLowers the gun.  Nods in the direction Valentine went.AVERY... that way ...

     Wilson moves on.  Avery just lies there, presumably to die.EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  STEPS.  NIGHT.Valentine hurries down the rickety steps.  Trying not to slip
     in the darkness, though there are tiny Malibu lights
     illuminating the steep and winding wooden framework.EXT. BEACH.  NIGHT.A rocky cove.  Valentine looks back up the way he came,
     HEARING the FOOTSTEPS coming down after him.  Backs away a
     few paces on the slippery rocks.  Falls.

     Lands on the crumpled, dead body of LARRY, the bodyguard, who
     was thrown off the cliff.  Valentine recoils.  When Wilson
     appears, Valentine FIRES at him.  A wild shot that only makes
     Wilson duck momentarily.  Valentine scrambles to his feet,
     runs on.WILSONJumps down from the steps.  Stops for a moment and leans his
     back against the railing.  Bends at the knees slightly.THE KNIFEThe handle is forced upward just enough to be reachable now.WILSONGrimacing, pulls the knife out and discards it.FURTHER DOWN THE BEACHValentine runs.  Or tries to.  It's dark and the ground is
     treacherous.  The beach runs out pretty soon.  Now just
     rocks.  Maybe he thought he could get around the rocks on the
     point at the other end.  But he can't see very far ahead.
     And the tide is in, water making any escape extremely
     difficult.  He tries to scramble over some rocks.  They're
     wet, slippery.  He falls, cries out as he literally breaks an
     ankle.WILSONA dark figure.  Coming into focus.  Walking inexorably this
     way.VALENTINEPainfully rights himself.  A small bone protrudes from his
     broken ankle.  He FIRES at Wilson, gun in one hand, other
     hand gripping his wrist to try and steady it.  Doing his best
     to aim.  But the SHOTS miss their mark.WILSONSteadily coming.VALENTINEOut of bullets now.  Gun CLICKING crazily on empty.  He
     simply drops it.WILSONNow stands before him.THE TWO OF THEMBoth breathing hard.WILSONTell me.

     This is not what Valentine expected.VALENTINEWhat.WILSONTell me.VALENTINETell you ...WILSONAbout Jenny.

               Tell me about Jenny.

               you had to kill my daughter for when she
               found out about it, you bastard.

     Wilson drops to the ground too, in a passionate fury, starts
     strangling Valentine.WILSONTell me.  Tell me about it, you fucking
               bastard.

     Easing up just enough for Valentine to sputter out a
     response.VALENTINEShe could've had the deal!  I would've
               handed it to her if she wanted.  I would
               have given her everything.WILSONWhythen.  Why did you do it!

     They're locked in a kind of embrace.  Sprayed by the waves
     crashing into the rocks.  Sweating and gasping and exhausted
     and hurt and furious.VALENTINEShe didn't want to share it, she wanted
               to stop it.  To stop me.She said she'dturn me in.WILSONShock of recognition on his face.  At those words.VALENTINEShe said, "You go ahead with this, I'll
               turn you in, Terry."

     Wilson sits back.  Panting.  Totally spent.  The two of them.
     Both on the ground now.  Whatever energy they had left drained
     -- Valentine from his confession, Wilson from hearing it.
     Valentine shaking, sobbing.  Still not realizing the pathetic
     folly of his actions.VALENTINEShe was serious.  She would have done it.
               She had the phone in her hand.  She was
               going to do it.WILSONKnows that the girl he loved ... loved Valentine, too.  Having
     heard the truth, the last vestige of revenge has vanished.
     He gets up and walks away.  Leaving the quivering shell of
     Valentine behind.CUT.INT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.Adhara wakes up.  Hand to her smashed cheek and mouth.  But
     it's not her hand.  It's Valentine's.  She sort of shuffles
     away from him along the floor.  Sits against a wall holding
     her face.  Valentine sits back against an opposite wall.
     They stare at each other.CUT.INT. PLANE.  DAY.Wilson, lost in thought.  Accepts a drink from a FLIGHT
     ATTENDANT.  We can see it pains him to reach for it.WILSONTa.

     After setting the glass down, his other hand goes to the
     shoulder where his stab wound was no doubt only temporarily
     dealt with.FLASH CUTS:

     WILSON. At the roadside hotel, grimacing.

     ELAINE. Cleaning his wound.Wilson rubs his shoulder.  The AMERICAN LADY in the seat
     beside him heard the way he said thanks to the Flight
     Attendant.LADYYou're English.

     A small beat (which he takes each time he responds).WILSONYeah, that's right.LADYI can never decide what I like better.

     WILSON. Shaving in the mirror at his L.A. motel. He stops.

     picture of Jenny.WILSONI would have preferred staying home, me.LADYYou're a reluctant traveller, then.

     Wilson nods.FLASH CUTS:

     Sur. Everyone in their own world.

               back, then.WILSONYeah.  Another little matter needs
               attending to soon as I return.LADYNo rest for the wicked.

     Wilson nods, exhales.FLASH CUT:

     the film. Watching the lights go by.WILSONBeen away a lot.LADYWhere else?

     Longer beat.  He actually turns to look at her now.  Takes
     her in, then looks forward again.WILSONOut on a oil rig.  In the North Sea.

               Is that legal?WILSONWell, time off for good behavior, you
               know.  I shouldn't have even been there
               -- it was these other blokes who shoulda
               gone in my place.  I got lumbered with
               the job they were responsible for.  I
               don't mind pulling me own cart, but not
               someone else's, know what I mean.LADYBut you stuck it out, anyway, all that
               time.WILSONI had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it.
               Then just when I'd finished my nine years

     Sips his drink.  Then, hard:WILSONThem next.CUT TO BLACK.THE END.
