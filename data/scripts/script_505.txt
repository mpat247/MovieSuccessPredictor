                                      John SteinbeckAN OKLAHOMA PAVED HIGHWAY in daylight. At some distance, 
               hoofing down the highway, comes Tom Joad. He wears a new 
               stiff suit of clothes, ill-fitting, and a stiff new cap, 
               which he gradually manages to break down into something 
               comfortable. He comes down the left side of the road, the 
               better to watch the cars that pass him. As he approaches, 
               the scene changes to a roadside short-order RESTAURANT on 
               the right side of the road. From it comes the sound of a 
               phonograph playing a 1939 popular song. In front of the eatery 
               is a huge Diesel truck labeled: OKLAHOMA CITY TRANSPORT 
               COMPANY. The driver, a heavy man with army breeches and high-
               laced boots, comes out of the restaurant, the screen door 
               slamming behind him. He is chewing on a toothpick. A waitress 
               appears at the door, behind the screen.WAITRESSWhen you be back?DRIVERCouple a weeks. Don't do nothin' you 
                         wouldn't want me to hear about!

               We see him climbing into the cab of the truck from the right 
               side. Getting behind the wheel, he is releasing the handbrake 
               when Tom appears at the driver's seat window.TOMHow about a lift, mister?DRIVERCan't you see that sticker?

               He indicates a "No Riders" sticker on the windshield.TOMSure I see it. But a good guy don't 
                         pay no attention to what some heel 
                         makes him stick on his truck.

               After a moment of hesitation the driver releases the brake.DRIVERScrunch down on the running board 
                         till we get around the bend.

               As Tom scrunches down on the running board the driver throws 
               the truck into gear and it moves.

               The scene dissolves to the CAB OF THE TRUCK. It is day, and 
               Tom is seated beside the driver, who is surreptitiously eyeing 
               him, trying to confirm some suspicion--an inspection which 
               Tom ignores at first.DRIVERGoin' far?TOM(shaking his head)
                         Just a few miles. I'd a walked her 
                         if my dogs wasn't pooped out.DRIVERLookin' for a job?TOMNo, my old man got a place, forty 
                         acres. He's a sharecropper, but we 
                         been there a long time.DRIVER(after a curious glance)
                         Oh!

               Cautiously, the driver's eyes drop to Tom's feet. We see 
               TOM'S SHOES. They are prison shoes--new, stiff and bulky.

               Curiosity is in the eyes of the DRIVER as they shoot a swift 
               glance at Tom. TOM is looking straight ahead, with the dead-
               pan look that prisoners get when they are trying to conceal 
               something. The DRIVER'S eyes take in Tom's hands and the 
               stiff coat.DRIVERBeen doin' a job?TOMYeah.DRIVERI seen your hands. You been swinging 
                         a pick or a sledge--that shines up 
                         your hands. I notice little things 
                         like that all the time.
                              (After a pause)
                         Got a trade?TOM(evenly)

                         Get to what?TOMYou know what I mean. You been givin'

                         Whyn't you go on and ask me where I 
                         been?DRIVERI don't stick my nose in nobody's 
                         business.TOMNaw--not much!DRIVER(a little frightened)
                         I stay in my own yard.TOM(without emotion)
                         Listen. That big nose of yours been 
                         goin' over me like a sheep in a 
                         vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' 
                         it a secret. I been in the 
                         penitentiary. Been there four years.

                         Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.DRIVERI didn't mean nothing.TOMMe neither. I'm just tryin' to get 
                         along without shovin' anybody around, 
                         that's all.

                         See that road up ahead?DRIVERYeah.TOMThat's where I get off.

               With a sigh of relief the driver puts his foot on the brake. 
               The TRUCK stops and Tom gets out. He look at the uneasy driver 
               contemptuously.TOMYou're about to bust to know what I 
                         done, ain't you?  Well, I ain't a 
                         guy to let you down.
                              (Confidentially)
                         Homicide!

               The driver throws the truck into gear. He doesn't like this 
               at all.DRIVERI never asked you!TOM(as the truck moves 
                              away)

                         hadn't tol' you.

               He looks indifferently after the truck and then starts on 
               foot down the dirt crossroad. A wind has begun to blow.

               The scene dissolves to the roadside under a WILLOW TREE in 
               daylight. The wind is still blowing. Sitting on the ground, 
               his back against the tree, Casy, a long, lean man in overalls, 
               blue shirt, and one sneaker, is fixing something on the other 
               dirty sneaker. To the tune of "Yes, Sir, That's My Baby" he 
               is absent-mindedly singing.CASYMmmmm he's my saviour. Mmmmm my 
                         saviour, Mmmmmmmmmm my saviour now.

                              comes down the road)
                         Howdy, friend.

               Carrying his coat under his arm, TOM wipes his face with his 
               cap as he cuts off the road to acknowledge the greeting.TOMHowdy.

               He stops, grateful for the momentary relief of the shade.CASYSay, ain't you young Tom Joad--ol' 
                         Tom's boy?TOM(surprised)

               The scene dissolves to the SURFACE OF A DIRT ROAD by daylight. 
               Leaves are scuttling across it. The top soil begins to fly

               A DUST STORM, like a black wall, rises into the sky, moving 
               forward. TOM AND CASY are running, but looking back over 
               their shoulders as the DUST STORM nears. Dust rises from the 
               ground to join and thicken the black wall.

               TOM AND CASY are seen racing down the road to the cabin, the 
               wind whipping up the dust. The two men smack open the door 
               and slam it shut after them. The screen begins to grow dark 
               as the storm sweeps over the land. It becomes black.

               In THE CABIN, it is black too, but the sound is different.

                         on a shelf.

               Presently, after shuffling about, he has found them and lights 
               one. He holds it up, lighting the room. A couple of wooden 
               boxes are on the floor, a few miserable discarded things, 
               and that's all. Tom's eyes are bewildered.TOMThey're all gone--or dead.CASYThey never wrote you nothing?TOMNo. They wasn't people to write.

               From the floor he picks up a woman's high button shoe, curled 
               up at the toe and broken over the instep.TOMThis was Ma's. Had 'em for years.

               Dropping the shoe, he picks up a battered felt hat.TOMThis used to be mine. I give it to 
                         Grampa when I went away.

               Dropping the hat, he moves with the candle toward the door 
               to the back, the only other room of the cabin. He stands in 
               the doorway, holding the candle high.

               In the BACK ROOM the scene moves from Tom at the door across 
               the room to the shadows, where a skinny little man sits 
               motionless, wide-eyed, staring at Tom. His name is Muley.MULEYTommy?TOM(entering)

               MULEY is seen at close range. Not actually crazy, Muley is a 
               little touched. His eyes rove upward as he listens to the 
               sound of the storm, the sough of the wind and the soft hiss

               The scene dissolves to MULEY'S DOORYARD. It is a soft spring 
               day, with the peaceful sounds of the country. Seated in a 
               three-year-old touring car is THE MAN, a city man with a 
               collar and tie. He hates to do what he is doing and this 
               makes him gruff and curt, to hide his misgivings. Squatted 
               beside the car are Muley, his son-in-law, and a half-grown 
               son. At a respectful distance stand Muley's wife, his 
               daughter, with a baby in her arms, and a small barefooted 
               girl, watching worriedly. The men soberly trace marks on the 
               ground with small sticks. A hound dog sniffs at the automobile 
               wheels.THE MANFact of the matter, Muley, after 
                         what them dusters done to the land, 
                         the tenant system don't work no more.

                         show a profit. One man on a tractor 
                         can handle twelve or fourteen of 
                         these places. You just pay him a

               The scene dissolves to a MONTAGE OF TRACTORS: tractors looming 
               over hillocks, flattening fences, through gullies, their 
               drivers looking like robots, with goggles, dust masks over 
               mouth and nose--one after the other, crossing and recrossing 
               as if to convey the impression that this was an invasion of

                         month ago.

               The scene dissolves to MULEY'S FARM. We see the backs of 
               Muley and the two younger men standing shoulder to shoulder 
               watching a lumbering tractor headed straight toward them. It 
               is at some distance. Muley holds a shotgun. His son has a 
               baling hook. The son-in-law has a two-by-four. Behind them 
               is their cabin. Frightened and huddled together are the women 
               and children. The roar of the tractor comes closer.MULEY(shouting)
                         You come any closer and I'm gonna

                              (He lifts his shotgun)

               The TRACTOR continues to lumber along, its driver goggled 
               and black of face where his dust mask doesn't cover. MULEY 
               lifts his shotgun to his shoulder, and aims.MULEYI *tol'* you!

               The TRACTOR stops. The driver takes off his goggles and dust 
               mask. Like the others he's a country boy. His face is sullen. 
               Muley is lowering his shotgun. There is a surprise in his 
               face as he recognizes the driver.MULEYWhy, you're Joe Davis's boy!

               He moves forward, followed by his son and son-in-law in the 
               TRACTOR. Davis is wiping his face as they walk toward him.DAVISI don't like nobody drawin' a bead 
                         on me.MULEYThen what are you doin' this kind a

               And the tractor roars into slow motion again...

               We see the HOUSE AND TRACTOR. The womenfolks scamper out of 
               the way as the tractor heads for a corner of the house. It 
               goes over a ramshackle fence and then a feeble little flower 
               bed. Muley and the two younger men walk along. Breathing 
               hard, frightened and desperate, Muley is shouting warnings 
               at Davis, but the roar of the tractor drowns his voice. The 
               dog barks excitedly, snarling at the tractor. THE WOMENFOLKS 
               stand watching, terrified but dead pan, until a cry bursts 
               from Muley's wife.WIFEDon't! Please don't!

               The little girl begins to whimper.MULEYI'm tellin' you!

               The TRACTOR moves across the yard, nosing a chair out of the 
               way, and with a rending of boards hits a corner of the house, 
               knocking a part of the foundation away. The corner of the 
               house sinks. MULEY lifts his shotgun, aims it, holds it, and 
               then slowly lowers it. As he stands looking at what has 
               happened his shoulders sag. He seems almost to shrink.

               The scene dissolves to MULEY, once more in the back room of 
               Tom's old home, as the sound of the storm continues.MULEY(dully)

                         wouldn't let me. So now I just wander 
                         around. Sleep wherever I am. I used 
                         to tell myself I was lookin' out for 
                         things, so when they come back 
                         ever'thing would be all right. But I 
                         knowed that wan't true. There ain't

               DRIED CORNSTALKS, seen by daylight, fade in. The cornstalks, 
               their roots blown clean and clear of the earth, lie fallen 
               in one direction. This is what has happened to farms that 
               were once rich and green. Then Uncle John's cabin comes into 
               view. It is just after sunup. The air is filled with country 
               sounds--a shrill chorus of birds, a dog barking in the 
               distance. The cabin is of the same general appearance as the 
               Joad cabin but even smaller. Smoke curls from the chimney.

               We see a PLATTER ON A TABLE, inside the cabin. The platter 
               is filled with sidemeat. Over the scene comes Ma Joad's voice.MA'S VOICELord, make us thankful for what we

               out a piece of sidemeat.

               Five people are seated around the breakfast table on chairs 
               or boxes. They are Pa, Grampa, Granma, Noah, and Uncle John. 
               Two children, Ruthie and Winfield, stand to the table, because 
               there are no more chairs. Their heads are all bent as Ma, 
               standing with a fork in her hand between the table and the 
               stove, ends the grace. Heads lift and there is a bustle as 
               Ma turns back to the frying pork on the stove and the others 
               truck into their food. Granma points a spiteful finger at

               She begins to slobber in mimicry. Winfield snickers. At that 
               instant Ma enters, unobserved, and without a word give Ruthie 
               a fine wallop. Nobody else pays any attention to the slap as 
               Ma, a bucket in her hand, moves on toward the door. We see 
               her now in the BACKYARD, first at the door, then moving toward 
               the well. She stops dead still, her eyes gazing outward.

               TOM is looking at the household goods piled around the yard, 
               to be taken to California. Casy is in the background. Then

               An automobile horn sounds sharply. Their laughter halted as 
               though cut by a knife, they look off. A TOURING CAR has 
               stopped in the road by the house, the engine still running. 
               One man drives, the other talks.MANHey, Joad! John Joad!

               In the BACKYARD the people are silent, their faces without 
               expression, as all gaze toward the touring car.MANAin't forgot, have you?JOHNWe ain't forgot.MANComin' through here tomorrow, you 
                         know.JOHNI know. We be out. We be out by sunup.

               The touring car's engine is still heard after the men drive 
               off. The Joads watch the car, their heads turning, their 
               eyes following, expressionless.

               The scene dissolves to the BACKYARD just before dawn. Now 
               and then a rooster crows. A couple of lanterns light the 
               scene as the man load the truck. It is nearly done, the body 
               piled high but flat with boxes, and more tied on running 
               boards. Al has the hood open and is working on the motor.

               tasks. They talk as they work.TOM(to Pa)

               INSIDE THE CABIN, Ma sits on a box in front of the stove. 
               The fire door is open and the light shines out. The room 
               itself has been pretty well stripped, with only trash and 
               discarded things left. In Ma's lap is a pasteboard shoebox 
               and she is going through the meager treasures stored in it, 
               to see what must go and what she can take with her. Her eyes 
               are soft and thoughtful as each item brings a memory, but 
               not sad. Occasionally she smiles faintly. She pulls out a 
               letter, looks at it, starts to throw it into the fire, then 
               puts it back in the box. Her hand pulls out a PICTURE 
               POSTCARD. We see it in Ma's hand. It is a picture of the 
               Statue Of Liberty. Over it: "Greetings from New York City." 
               She turns it over. It is addressed: "Mrs. Joad RFD 254 
               Oklahomy Territory." In the space for a message: "Hello honey. 
               Willy Mae."

               MA, after a moment of studying it, throws the card into the 
               fire. She lifts the letter again, puts it back. She pulls 
               out a worn NEWSPAPER CLIPPING. We see it in Ma's hand. The 
               headline is: "JOAD GETS SEVEN YEARS."

               MA drops the clipping into the fire. Rummaging around, she 
               pulls out a small CHINA DOG. We see it closely as before. On 
               it is printed: "Souvenir of Louisiana Purchase Exposition--
               St. Louis--1904."

               MA studies the dog, smiling, remembering something that it 
               meant in her life. Then she puts in in a pocket in her dress. 
               Next she pulls out some pieces of cheap jewelry; one cuff 
               link, a baby's signet ring, two earrings. She smiles at the 
               ring, then pockets it. The cuff link too. The earrings she 
               holds for a moment longer, then looks around to make sure 
               nobody sees, then holds them to her ears, not looking into 
               any kind of a mirror, just feeling them against the lobes of 
               her ears, as once perhaps she wore them. Her eyes are grave.TOM(from the door)
                         How about it, Ma?MAI'm ready.

               Tom disappears. Ma looks at the earrings, and then at the 
               contents of the box. She lifts out the letter again and looks 
               at it. Then, without drama, she drops it into the fire. She 
               watches it burn. Her eyes are still on the flame as she calls.MARosasharn honey! Wake up the chillun. 
                         We're fixin' to leave.

               The flame dies down.

               In the BACKYARD it is grey dawn. There is a thrill of quiet 
               excitement as they all stand around the loaded truck, hats 
               on, putting on coats. The ones missing are Ma, Rosasharn, 
               the children, and Grampa. Pa is in charge.PA(as Ma comes out of

               All turn. In a CORNER OF THE HOUSE Al is pulling Grampa gently 
               but firmly, the old man holding back, and furious. He flails

               Al permits Grampa to jerk loose and sit down on the doorstep. 
               The old man is miserable and frightened and angry, too old 
               to understand or accept such a violent change in his life.

               up onto a paved highway.

               The scene dissolves to a MONTAGE: Almost filling the screen 
               is the shield marker of the U.S. Highway 66. Superimposed on 
               it is a montage of jalopies, steaming and rattling and piled 
               high with goods and people, as they pull onto the highway, 
               to indicate as much as possible that this departure of the 
               Joad family is but part of a mass movement of jalopies and 
               families. The signs of towns on U.S. Highway 66 flash past--CHECOTAH, OKLAHOMA CITY, BETHANY.This dissolves to a HIGHWAY. It is late afternoon. The Joad 
               truck pulls of the paved highway and stops. The men leap 
               down quickly from the truck, all but Pa, who lifts Grampa in 
               his arms and then lowers him slowly, gently into Tom's arms.

               With a quilt pulled from the truck Ma runs ahead as Tom

               The others get down soberly from the truck, all but Granma, 
               who is dozing. Cars pass-a fast car passing a jalopy. Tom is 
               letting the old man down gently as Ma adjusts the quilt on 
               the ground. Death is in Grampa's eyes as he looks up dimly 
               at them.GRAMPA(a whisper)

               The scene dissolves to an insert of a NOTE. It is written 
               awkwardly in pencil on the flyleaf of a Bible. Tom's voice 
               recites the words.TOM'S VOICEThis here is William James Joad, 
                         dyed of a stroke, old old man. His

               HIGHWAY 66, in daylight, fades in: an Oklahoma stretch,

               exchange a glance and snother shrug at the foibles of women 
               and then look studiedly into space.

               The scene dissolves to a MONTAGE: superimposed on the marker 
               of U.S. Highway 66 an assortment of roadside signs flashes

               Flats, etc.

               A HAND-PAINTED SIGN reads: "CAMP 50�." It is night. We hear 
               the sound of guitar music. In the CAMP GROUND a small wooden 
               house dominates the scene. There are no facilities; the 
               migrants simply pitch makeshift tents and park their jalopies 
               wherever there is a space. It is after supper and a dozen or 
               more men sit on the steps of the house listening to Connie 
               play a road song on a borrowed guitar. The music softens the 
               tired, drawn faces of the men and drives away some of their 
               shyness. In the dark, outside the circle of light from the 
               gasoline lantern on the porch, some of the women and children 
               sit and enjoy the luxury of this relative gaiety. The 
               proprietor sits tipped back in a straight chair on the porch.

               We see the JOAD TENT. Behind their truck, a tarpaulin is 
               stretched over a rope from tree to tree. Granma lies asleep 
               on a quilt, stirring fitfully. Ma sits on the ground at her 
               head, fanning her with a piece of cardboard. Rosasharn lies

               Pa and the two children come in as Mae opens a drawer and 
               pulls out a long waxpaper-covered loaf of bread. The children

               But when he puts the dime down on the counter he has a penny 
               with it. He is about to drop this back in the pouch when his 
               eyes fall on the children staring at the candy. Slowly he

               Mae looks from the candy to the children. They have stopped

               Rigid with embarrassment, they accept the candy, looking 
               neither at it nor at each other. Pa picks up the loaf of 
               bread and they scramble for the door. At the door Pa turns

               As Mae watches them through the window, her eyes warm, Bert 
               walks around the counter to the three slot machines, a paper 
               with figures on it in his hand. The truck roars outside and

               left hand on the machine is a paper with three columns of

               The scene dissolves to an INSPECTION STATION, near Daggett, 
               California, at night. Obeying a sign that reads: "KEEP RIGHT 
               AND STOP," the Joad truck pulls up under a long shed as two 
               officers, yawning, come out to inspect it. One takes down

               The scene dissolves to the TEHACHAPI VALLEY, by day. Taking 
               it from the book, there is a breath-taking view of the valley 
               from where Highway 66 comes out of the mountains. This is 
               the California the Joads have dreamed of, rich and beautiful, 
               the land of milk and honey. It is just daybreak, with the 
               sun at the Joad's back. They have pulled off the side of the 
               road and stopped, just to drink in the sight. They are looking

               A TOWN STREET, by day, fades in. Down a town or small city 
               business street, with quite a bit of traffic, comes the Joad 
               truck being pushed by the Joad men. At the wheel, aiming at 
               a corner gas station, is Rosasharn, frightened and uncertain, 
               with Ma beside her on the front seat. In the back Ruthie and 
               Winfield are delighted with this new form of locomotion.

               It is a two-pump station and one of the pumps has a car, 
               with the attendant servicing it. The Joad truck stops by the 
               other pump and Tom, wiping his face with his sleeve, grins

               pause to watch as the Joad truck lumbers down a dirt incline 
               from the road and stops at the edge of the camp in front of 
               one of the most miserable of the shacks. The Joads regard

               on her knees feeding a small fire with broken sticks. On the 
               fire is a pot of stew. Ruthie and Winfield stand watching

               circle are now around the fire, their solemn eyes on the pot 
               of stew. Occasionally they look at Ma, then back at the stew.

               At the ROAD a new coupe drives off the highway and into the

               the camp are approaching slowly, silently. The women give

               Casy sits with eyes front. AT THE WILLOWS, screened by trees

               The scene dissolves to the ENTRANCE OF THE HOOPER RANCH in 
               daylight. A gravel road leads from the paved highway to the 
               big wire gates, which are enclosed. Along the side of the 
               paved highway are parked a dozen jalopies, the migrants 
               sitting soberly in them. Fifty or sixty other migrants line 
               the gravel road and the junction with the paved highway. 
               Five jalopies are in line waiting to enter the gates. And 
               the scene is overwhelmingly policed. There must be ten 
               motorcycle cops around. Six are dismounted and strolling to 
               keep order among the migrants along the road. Three, their 
               motorcycles roaring, flank the line of five jalopies. As the 
               Joad truck drives up, we see the FRONT SEAT. Tom, Al, and Ma 
               are beholding the scene with bewilderment.ALWhat is it, a wreck?COP(on motorcycle)

               The motorcycle escort forms around the line of six cars and 
               a deafening din is raised, of motorcycles, sirens, and an 
               inexplicable blowing of horns on the jalopies. At the same 
               time, as the gates open and the six cars start through, 
               flanked by the motorcycle cops, the migrants begin spasmodic 
               shouts, but what they say cannot be understood. As the cars 
               move slowly, Tom and Al in the FRONT SEAT are puzzled and 
               worried at the demonstration.ALMaybe the road's out.TOMI don't know what these cops got to

               AT THE GATES the heckling from the bystanders is spasmodic, 
               not continuous, as the six jalopies in line pass through the 
               gate into the Hooper ranch. Two men stand beside the gates 
               with shotguns. They keep calling.MENGo on, go on! Keep movin'!

               The Joad truck passes through the gates. IN THE HOOPER RANCH 
               the six jalopies are halted at the end of a camp street. The 
               houses are small, square blocks, set in line. One, a little 
               larger, is a grocery store. Casually about are men in pairs 
               with metal stars on their shirts and shotguns in their hands.

               IN THE RANCH STREET. There is a faint moonlight, but not 
               much, and little sound from the other houses as Tom strolls 
               down the street.

               NEAR THE GATE: beyond, cars pass. As Tom approaches the gate 
               a flashlight plays on his face suddenly and a guard rises 
               from a box.GUARDWhere you think you're going?TOMThought I'd take a walk. Any law 
                         against it?GUARDWell, you just turn around and walk

                         some help and take you back?TOMI'll walk back.

               The guard watches him as he walks back and then douses his 
               flashlight.

               At a SECTION OF WIRE FENCE, watching his chance, moving 
               silently, Tom drops on the ground, on his back, gets his 
               head under the bottom wire, and pushes himself under and 
               outside. Rising, he crosses the paved highway.

               AN EMBANKMENT across the road from the wire fence: Tom 
               clambers down it, moving quietly. He picks his way down the 
               shallow ravine.

               A TENT: there is a light inside and there are the shadows of 
               figures. In the background, beyond the tent, is the silhouette 
               of a small concrete bridge spanning a small stream. Following 
               a trail, Tom enters and approaches the tent. (The opening is 
               away from him.) IN FRONT OF THE TENT, a man sitting on a box 
               looks up suspiciously as Tom enters. His name is Joe.TOMEvenin'.JOEWho are you?TOMJus' goin' pas', that's all.JOEKnow anybody here?TOMNo. Jus' goin' pas', I tell you.

                              the tent.)

               INSIDE THE TENT, three other men sit on the ground as Casy

               door, followed by Tom and the other man.IN FRONT OF THE TENT:CASY(softly)

               There are night sounds but little else to be distinguished.CASYCan't tell if you hear it or not.

                         I hear it. I think they's some guys

                         Down that way--under the bridge span.

               Casy leads the way softly. THE BRIDGE SPAN is seen from the 
               stream as Casy, Tom, and the other man wade carefully toward 
               it.

               UNDER THE BRIDGE it is almost black as they creep through 
               the culvert. Just as Casy and Tom step out from under the 
               bridge on the other side, a blinding flashlight hits them, 
               lighting them like day.VOICEThere they are! Stand where you are!

               Halted, uncertain, they stand as three men with stars on 
               their coats and pickhandles in their hands slide down the 
               EMBANKMENT. Two of them hold lighted flashlights.DEPUTYThat's him! That one in the middle, 
                         the skinny one! Chuck! Alec! Here 
                         they are! We got 'em!

               There are faint responses from a distance. CASY AND TOM are 
               alone. The others have fled. The deputies approach, their 
               lights on Casy and Tom.CASYListen, you fellas. You don't know 
                         what you're doin'. You're helpin' to 
                         stave kids.DEPUTYShut up, you red--

               He swings the pickhandle. Casy dodges but the stick cracks 
               his skull. He falls face down out of the light. The deputies 
               watch for a moment but Casy doesn't stir.SECOND DEPUTYLooks like to me you killed him.DEPUTYTurn him over. Put the light on him.

               Bending over, their bodies hide Casy.

               TOM, seen close, is breathing hard, his eyes glistening.DEPUTY'S VOICEServes him right, too.

               As the deputies straighten up, Tom steps forward, grabs the 
               pickhandle from the man who felled Casy, and swings. The 
               blow strikes the deputy's arm, sending his flashlight flying, 
               and the scene is in semi-darkness as Tom swings again. There 
               is a grunt and a groan as the deputy goes down. Then all is 
               confusion. Backing away, swinging the pickhandle, Tom bolts, 
               splashes a few yards through the stream, turns and gains a 
               better start by throwing the pickhandle at his pursuers. 
               They duck, and Tom disappears into the night. The other men 
               rush through the scene in pursuit.

               THE SECOND DEPUTY is seen bending over the body of the man 
               Tom laid out.SECOND DEPUTYWhere's that flash?THIRD DEPUTYHere.

               The light flashes on the man's face.THIRD DEPUTY(awed)

               TOM is seen crashing through the bushes, his face bloody. 
               The scene fades out.

               THE EXTERIOR OF HOUSE 63 fades in. It is day. Ma comes down

               telegraphed here. But the caretaker obviously attaches no 
               significance to either. The shack is bare but for a cot, a 
               table, a chair, and an electric light. The caretaker is seated 
               at the table, pen in hand, a soiled ledger open, when Tom 
               enters.CARETAKERI don't mean to be nosy, y'understand.

               As he exits we see the GOVERNMENT CAMP, with Tom coming out 
               of the shack, amazement still on his face. As he walks slowly 
               down the main camp street we share the revelation of the 
               place to him. It is nearly daylight. Roosters crow in the 
               distance. The street is neat and orderly in a military way, 
               its cleanliness in sharp contrast to anything he has known 
               before. Inside the tents people are stirring. In front of 
               one tent a woman is cooking breakfast. A baby is in her arms.TOMGood mornin'.WOMANMornin'.

               As he walks on, Tom draws a breath of exultation. As he moves 
               on, looking around, we see the EXTERIOR OF SANITARY UNIT NO. 
               4, a cheap frame building the purpose of which is pretty 
               obvious. Ruthie, warily alert lest she be caught, is peering 
               in the door. She looks a long time and then she runs out of 
               the scene.

               WINFIELD is seen asleep in a quilt on the ground when Ruthie 
               enters and rousts him out.RUTHIE(in an excited whisper)

               He stumbles after her.

               THE EXTERIOR OF SANITARY UNIT NO. 4. Ruthie is putting on a

               He follows her into the unit, big-eyed with excitement and 
               apprehension. There is a silence. Then:RUTHIE'S VOICEThem's where you wash your han's.

               There is the sound of a toilet flushing. It is a cheap toilet 
               and it is a loud flush which eventually ends in a long 
               refilling of the tank just as loudly. There is a paralyzed 
               silence. Then:RUTHIE'S VOICENow you done it! You busted it!WINFIELD'S VOICEI never--

               Terrified, Winfield comes dashing out of the unit but Ruthie 
               grabs him just outside the door. Beginning to cry, he 
               struggles to get away.WINFIELDLemme go! I didn't go to do it!RUTHIE(fiercely)

               He nods quickly. Then Ruthie begins to walk away with what 
               she fancies is an innocent, nonchalant stroll, yawning 
               casually. Sniffling a little, Winfield mimics her, a very 
               innocent walk and yawn indeed.

               The scene dissolves to a DITCH. Alongside the ditch are some 
               lengths of concrete pipe. Tom and the two Wallaces are in 
               the ditch, Tom and Tim picking, Wilkie shoveling.TOM(exulting)

               The scene dissolves to the GATE TO THE CAMP, at night. It is 
               Saturday evening, the night of the dance. Glaring electric 
               lights hang over the open gate. Parked jalopies line the 
               highway as the invited guests, small farmers and migrants 
               from other camps and their families, arrive to be greeted 
               and checked by a committee of three men.COMMITTEE MANEv'nin', ma'am. Who'd you say invited

               There is an air of eager anticipation, of gay celebration, 
               and everyone is in his or her best--the men in clean washed 
               overalls, clean shirts, some with ties, their hair damp and 
               slicked down, the women in their nicest. Through the gate, 
               inside the camp, can be seen the outdoor dance floor, brightly 
               lighted, with the camp musicians already tuning up, and around 
               the dance floor scores of wide-eyed children.

               INSIDE THE GATE TO THE CAMP, we see Wilkie and a dark-
               complexioned man named Jule standing among a group inside 
               watching the arrivals. They watch sharply, eyeing everyone, 
               listening to every credential. As his employer, Thomas, comes 
               through the gate with his wife, Wilkie grins and greets him

               Smiling mysteriously, Ma fishes in a pocket in her dress and 
               brings out the envelope of her treasures. From it she produces 
               the earrings and holds them up in front of Rosasharn's wide 
               eyes.MA(softly)

               They smile at each other, proud in the luxury of ornaments.

               Down the road from the GATE a touring car with six men pulls 
               of the pavement and stops. Three men get out. They are 
               bareheaded and dressed similar to the other migrants. They 
               stroll down the highway toward the gate. The other men, 
               deputies, sit watching them.WITHIN THE GATE:WILKIEThey tell me you're half Injun. You

               Wilkie moves after them.

               Well in front, among the older folks and children who surround

               stops in front of them.MA(quietly)

               The three men stroll into sight and stand watching the 
               dancing. One glances at Ma and Rosasharn but does not speak. 
               Ma has smiled back at him.

               WILKIE AND JACKSON are seen; removed somewhat from the dance

               We find ourselves INSIDE TIM WALLACE'S TENT.  The five members

               In front of the JOAD TENT, dressed to kill, is Al, ready for 
               the festivities. He wears a tight-fitting wool suit, a tie 
               on his shirt, yellow shoes, and his hair is damp and slicked 
               down. He rubs his hands together in anticipation as he strolls 
               in the direction of the dance floor.

               At ANOTHER TENT, a blonde girl sits on a box as Al enters. 
               Casually he throws open his coat, revealing a vivid striped 
               shirt. This is designed to stun his quarry.ALGonna dance tonight?

               A fat woman thrusts her head out of the tent.WOMANYou git right along! This here girl's 
                         spoke for. She's gonna be married, 
                         an' her man's a-comin' for her.

               Shrugging, Al winks at the girl and moves on, stepping and 
               moving his shoulders and snapping his fingers in time to the 
               music, a very gay fellow indeed. The blonde girl's eyes follow 
               him. Then she turns and glances cautiously toward the tent.

               ON THE DANCE FLOOR, we see Ma and Rosasharn as Tom enters 
               and stands between them. This is during a pause between dances 
               and only a few couples stand on the floor waiting for the 
               music to begin again. We also see the three men very casually 
               looking around--but no more casual looking than Wilkie, 
               standing just behind them, idly whistling.TOM(grinning)

                         prettier.

               The music starts again, once more the dancers move onto the 
               dance floor. The three men exchange a glance and step casually 
               to the edge of the dancing space, one in the lead. They survey 
               the scene, but for the moment make no further move. The 
               atmosphere is tense.TOM(softly)

               AL, taking the blonde girl's hand, steps onto the dance floor. 
               Encircling her waist, they begin to dance. They are a smooth, 
               rhythmic couple who move as one being.ALWell, you said anybody can waltz...

               At this moment the leader of the three men (the other two 
               directly behind him) enters the scene.LEADERI'll dance with this girl.AL(angrily)

               quietly, Tom and Wilkie in the middle.LEADERDon't gimme no argament--

               His fist goes back, his left hand reaches for Al's collar. 
               At the same instant Tom grabs him, Wilkie claps his hand 
               over the leader's mouth, at least fifteen other men have 
               similarly collard the other two invaders, and they are all 
               lifted bodily. There is not a sound as the three men, held 
               in iron grips, are whisked from the dance floor and into the 
               crowd.

               Two touring cars have stopped in front of the closed GATE 
               and the deputies have drawn guns.DRIVEROpen up! We hear you got a riot.CARETAKERRiot? I don't see no riot. Who're

               As the deputies, puzzled and uncertain, look toward the DANCE 
               FLOOR, we see the music, the dancing, the gaiety continuing 
               as if nothing had happened.

               WITHIN THE JOAD TENT at night, several hours later: the tent 
               is black, Tom strikes a match. From a piece of wood on the 
               ground or floor he selects one from several cigarette butts 
               and lights it. While he is doing so, he lifts his head 
               suddenly, and listens.

               In the CAMP STREET we catch sight of legs walking, the ground 
               lighted from a flashlight. Two pairs of the legs wear state 
               policemen's leather leggings. The third pair are the 
               caretaker's. They stop behind a car. The flashlight plays on 
               the license plate. One of the state cops leans down to copy 
               the license number in a booklet. Then they move on.

               TOM has lifted the edge of the tent a trifle, enough to see 
               out by flattening his head on the floor. The LEGS are now 
               seen at the Joad jalopy. The light is on the license plate. 
               The cop leans over and copies the number. They move on.

               TOM, lowering the edge of the tent, sits up. Quietly he pushes 
               aside the piece of carpet that covers him. He is wearing his 
               clothes. We see the policeman's CAR at the caretaker's hut. 
               The two policemen get into the car.CARETAKERYou got no right to arrest anybody 
                         without a warrant, you know.FIRST COPWe'll have a warrant--just as soon 
                         as we check with headquarters.

               The car drives off, leaving the caretaker looking somberly 
               after it.

               WITHIN THE JOAD TENT, his cap on, fully dressed for travel, 
               Tom is tieing the ends of the carpet into a shoulder bundle. 
               Rising, he slings it across his shoulder. As he tiptoes toward 
               the door:MAAin't you gonna tell me goodbye,
