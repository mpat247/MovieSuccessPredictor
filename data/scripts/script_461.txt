                        David TwohyFIRST DRAFTAugust 6, 1995FADE IN:INT.  SENATE HEARING ROOM - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAYBlinding in their white uniforms, naval flag officers sit
in the audience, showing their support for THEODORE HAYES,
a 50-year-old civilian.  This is his confirmation hearing.
Reading from prepared material:HAYES... last few years have brought many
          advances in the interests of women
          in naval service, particularly in
          the land-based maritime specialties.
          What's more, the Navy has instituted
          special sensitivity courses with an
          eye on --DEHAVENWhoa, whoa, whoa.  "Land-based
          maritime specialties." Gimme a
          second here to de-euphemize that...

At the center of a dais, LILLIAN DEHAVEN leans back to
ponder the ceiling of the hearing room.  Her plaque card
reads "CHAIRPERSON -- SENATE ARMS COMMITTEE." DeHaven is a
tough-hided old Southern belle, Scarlett O'Hara at 60.
In her arsenal she carries conversational hand-grenades --
and she's apt to pull a pin at the slightest whim.DEHAVENWould that be anything like
          "typing"?  "Restocking the
          cupboards"?  That sort of thing, Mr.
          Hayes?

CHUCKLES from the packed gallery.  The flag officers go
stone-faced.  Hayes forces a smile.HAYESHardly the case, Senator.DEHAVENWell, I'm just an old dame without
          much time left, so you'll pardon me
          if I jump right in here before they
          discontinue my blood-type.  I am
          deeply concerned over the Navy's
          seemingly incontrovertible attitude
          toward women in the military.  Case
          in point...

On cue, aides begin distributing reports to other members
of the dais.  Hayes gets a copy, too.  And it jars him.DEHAVEN"The Lark Report."HAYESMadam Senator... this is an internal
          document of the U.S. Navy.  I must
          seriously question whether --DEHAVEN(to others on panel)
          The Navy's conclusion regarding the
          crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft
          carrier.  Female aviator, it just so
          happens.
                  (to Hayes)
          You're familiar with this report and
          its conclusion, am I right?HAYESI was one member of the investigating
          commission.DEHAVENYes, I see your signature right here
          -- twice the size of everyone
          else's.  And your conclusion was
          "pilot error," hmm?HAYESI'm really not prepared for any kind
          of in-depth review of --DEHAVENI'd like to think our next Secretary
          of the Navy would be prepared for
          anything, Mr. Hayes.

A humorless smile.  She's roasting his nuts over an open
fire, and everyone knows it.HAYESThe commission concluded that the
          aviator in question failed to
          execute a proper approach to the
          carrier.DEHAVENThat aside for the moment, I'm
          struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit
          of your report... the degrading
          remarks by other aviators...
          innuendo about her performance in
          unrelated situations... even a
          reference to her sexual activity the
          weekend prior.
                  (closing report)
          In my seven years on this committee,
          I've never seen a downed aviator
          treated like this.  Never.  I'm
          deeply disturbed by this report, Mr.
          Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for
          women in the military -- but for
          your own confirmation as well.INT.  CORRIDOR - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAYHeading for her office, DeHaven is escorted by a smallPRESS RETINUE.DEHAVEN... a full 35 percent of all jobs in
          the U.S. military are still, to this
          day, off-limits to women.  And
          that's simply gotta change.PRESS #1What about those who say women
          aren't suited for all jobs?  That
          they're physically weaker... they
          have less stamina...DEHAVENSure.  And we're gonna hog the
          bathroom, too.

          meeting.DEHAVENI'll act surprised.INT.  DEHAVEN'S OFFICE - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAYShoes dumped on her desk, DeHaven changes out knee-high
stockings while devoting one ear to...WHITE HOUSE #1... to reassure you that he has
          every faith in the ability of Mr.
          Hayes to guide the Navy into the
          next century.  The task, as the
          Administration sees it, is to
          acknowledge changing realities
          without losing traditional values.

A beat.  DeHaven looks between the two WHITE HOUSE boys --
#1 young and eager, #2 older and cagier.DEHAVEN'Zat it?  Ten minutes, nothin' on
          the table?  Sweetcakes, you best go
          back to the President and tell him
          to open up the phone book and start
          lookin' for his next nominee.

White House #1 looks spanked.  Taking over, #2 pops a
briefcase.  An inch-think report appears before DeHaven.WHITE HOUSE #2Administration's plan for 100
          percent integration.  If female
          candidates measure up in a series of
          test cases, the President will
          support full integration within
          three years' time.

Surprised -- maybe even startled -- DeHaven flips through
the report, absorbing by osmosis.WHITE HOUSE #2It's your gender-blind Navy,
          Senator.  Surely you're not going to
          balk now.DEHAVENWell, it's just that askin' you all
          to integrate the Navy is like
          sending a man to do a woman's job.

          got the job.  You going to take a
          swing?  Or step out of the box?

DeHaven riffles the edges of the report, thinking it over.
Thinking light years ahead.EXT.  CAPITOL BLDG. - DAYButtoning up topcoats, the White House boys move down
marble steps to reach a pair of limousines.  Hayes and two

          60 percent drop-out rate among the
          men.HAYESThen I suggest we start there.FLAG OFFICER #1Doesn't matter who she picks.  No

          commando training course.  And I
          don't care who it is.EXT.  POTOMAC RIVER - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAYWinterscape:  Dotted with ice floes, the Potomac wends

          an Early Warning system.  Extraction

          conventional sub off-shore for

A dubious beat.ROYCEYou expect the extraction team to

Silence on the radio:  They're discussing her scenario
privately.  During, Jordan's kayak reaches the junction of
the Potomac and the Anacostia rivers.  On the far bank
lies...

                  (answering Jordan)
          In 1981, the Supreme Court was
          asked to rule on the issue of women
          in combat positions.  The Court
          cited the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws
          as a legal foundation for keeping
          women ineligible.  That decision
          held for all these years -- until
          the White House, 10 days ago, moved
          to have the Exclusion Laws voided.
          To demolish that legal foundation.JORDANSo?  Isn't the President jumping on
          your bandwagon?DEHAVENWhat he did was light the bandwagon
          on fire.  Because he knows what I
          know -- that American families are
          not prepared to put their daughters
          in harm's way.JORDANYou don't know that.DEHAVENIn face, I do:  Roper, Harris,
          Gallop -- they all come back the
          same.JORDANWhat are you saying?  That a women's
          life is more valuable than a man's?
          That a women's death hurts a family
          more?DEHAVENI'm saying it's not going to happen.
          Not when the President is set to
          turn this into a third-rail issue
          should I choose to ever campaign
          against him.  He will fry me six
          ways to Sunday for sending daughters
          and young mothers off to war -- and,
          quite possibly, for bringing them
          back in body bags.

Jordan shakes her head in disbelief.  She has met the
enemy -- and she is us.JORDANYou were never going to let women
          serve in combat.  You always had a
          safety net.  Or thought you did.DEHAVENJordan.  I don't expect you to fully
          understand this -- but sometimes
          there's more to be gained from the
          fight than the victory.JORDANSo the rhetoric gets you headlines.
          But the reality gets you in trouble.DEHAVENThe reality is this:  We send far
          too many men off to war.  I don't
          need to compound the problem with
          women.
