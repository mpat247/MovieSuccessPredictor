          REVEAL our guy staring back at the kids. This is WILL (25),
          probably good looking in another life.2.Right now, he is tired and unamused, wearing a red "Giorgio's
          Trattoria" hat and a sweaty matching t-shirt.WILLGimme a break. You guys live two
           towns away. It's pretty much fucking
           impossible to get here in 30 minutes.OTHER 15-YEAR-OLDExactly. That's why we ordered from
           your shitty "trattoria."WILLThis is gonna come out of my paycheck.
           You sure you don't want to take the
           moral high ground?OTHER 15-YEAR-OLDWe'd rather take the pizzas.
                         
          Will takes a calming breath. Hands over the pizzas.WILLOk. You guys are pretty smart. You
           figured out a way to beat the system.(PEEKS INSIDE)Got the house to yourselves?15-YEAR-OLDThat's right.WILLNot bad. Any jailbait in there?
           Little pizza and a rainbow party?
                         
          The kids shakes their heads.WILLSeriously? Well, two hustlers like
           yourselves gotta have the place
           stocked with beer and whippits and
           shit, right? Just call the girls up
           and let them know the party's on.15-YEAR-OLDMan, we don't have any of that stuff.
                         
          Will makes a show of mulling this over.WILLI really shouldn't do this...but you
           seem like a couple of good dudes.
           I'll tell you what, you give me the
           money that your mom left you for the
           pizzas, and I'll grab you some beers.(MORE)3.WILL (CONT'D)(BEAT)But I get to keep the change as a
           tip. Deal?
                         
          The kids look at each other. One hesitantly pulls out some
          cash. Will snatches it and heads off.WILLI'll see you in like 20 minutes.
                         
          The kids look uncertain. As if sensing this, Will stops
          before getting into his ride.WILLYou boys like Budweiser, right?15-YEAR-OLDUh, yeah, totally.OTHER 15-YEAR-OLDLove that shit!INT. MUSTANG - DAY - MOVINGThe sun sets. Will cruises back into his own middle-class

          Will stops at a light. Checks out a PRETTY YOUNG THING in
          the Jeep beside him. She catches him looking, rolls her
          eyes. The light turns and the Jeep skids away.
                         
          Will self consciously removes his "Giorgio's" cap.INT. GIORGIO'S TRATTORIA - NIGHTWill enters and nods at CHRISTOPHER (40s), the manager. His
          balding head is nearly translucent from absorbing a day's
          worth of pizza grease.WILLYo, Chris. Let me cash the fuck out.
                         
          Will hands over some cash to Christopher.CHRISTOPHERYou have a pretty good shift?WILLFor sure. I mean, the part where I
           had to drop off all those pizzas
           kinda sucked, but the rest was cool.4.CHRISTOPHEROh, yeah? 'Cause, I got some kids
           calling in saying you ripped them off.
           Promised to buy them beer or something.WILLI actually did buy the beer, but it
           would have been illegal to give it
           to them, right? So I'm gonna do the
           responsible thing and drink it myself.CHRISTOPHERThat's real funny. But I'm trying
           to run a business here.WILLWhat kind of business promises to
           deliver anywhere in 30 minutes?
           It's ridiculous.CHRISTOPHERI don't wanna hear another one of
           your bullshit excuses. You're fired.WILLCome on. If I didn't need this job,
           I wouldn't be doing this shitty job.
                         
          Chris is unmoving.WILLFuck! Whatever!
                         
          Will storms off. As he gets to the door -CHRISTOPHERYou know, you were an okay driver
           half the time. And you're not a Puerto
           Rican. Which means something to me.WILLThat's poignant.CHRISTOPHERI guess I could rehire you, on a
           provisional basis. Of course, this
           would be at the slightly reduced
           "new company rate."WILLAre you fucking serious?CHRISTOPHERI don't know. Is there anyone else
           left in town for you to work for?5.Will shakes his head. Swallows what's left of his pride.WILLWhen do I start?EXT. SMALL APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHTWill sits on the darkened front stoop. He tosses an empty
          can into the bushes and gets to work on his fourth beer.
          He looks over at a parked Hyundai Elantra. A YOUNG MAN sits
          in the passenger seat with a pensive look on his face. He
          makes a sudden, surprised gasp. The homely YOUNG WOMAN who
          was just blowing him sits up from his lap and rearranges
          herself in the driver seat. She leans over for a goodbye
          kiss. The Young Man obliges with much fanfare.
          The Young Man gets out and the car pulls away. This is CHET
          (25), a clean cut guy dressed in the Gap Premium Collection.
          He heads toward the building, high off his BJ, humming
          Outkast's "Ms. Jackson." He stops when he notices Will in
          the shadows.CHETWhat the hell? Have you just been
           sitting there?WILLYep. Caught the whole show. Really
           classy move at the end. You know,
           the kiss. Putting your tongue in
           her mouth right after you fucked it.CHETHey, a nice girl decides to pleasure
           me on a weeknight, in her car no
           less...I'm not gonna make her feel
           like an untouchable. I'm gonna make
           her feel like a lady.WILLWhat manners. May I offer you some
           alcohol, sir. To wash the taste of
           yourself out of your mouth.
          Will offers his beer. Chet takes a slug, gurgles for effect.CHETBy the way, she said she had a friend.
           Maybe we can go on our first double
           date since you tried to talk Jackie
           Fortunato and her cousin into having
           a four-way with us.WILLI misread their body language. It
           happens.6.Will picks up some rented movies sitting beside him.WILLCome on. Let's go inside, drink
           your beer and watch shit get crazy.(FANS MOVIES)Old favorites. You choose. Lethal
           Weapon, Lethal Weapon 2...was gonna
           get the third Lethal Weapon, but
           decided on a porn. So it's really
           between the first two.CHETI choose sleep. I gotta teach a
           class at eight.WILLYou're a sub. Just call in sick.
           Like the real teacher did.CHETCome on, man, you know I got promoted
           to full-time last month. You bought
           me a laser pointer.
                         
          Will heaves a sigh.WILLYeah, I know. I guess I'm just having
           a hard time accepting you as "the
           man." You know, flunking kids, giving
           out spite detentions to girls you
           wanna fuck, laser pointing at shit.CHETI also get healthcare and my summers
           off. It's not perfect, but it's a
           career.
                         
          Will grudgingly stands up.WILLI guess that's just the difference
           between you and me.
                         
          He holds up the Lethal Weapon DVDs.WILLI'm like Riggs. Cruising the streets.
           No rules, no attachments. Every
           other day some asshole is trying to
           take my badge. You're fucking
           Murtaugh. Always worried about your
           pension. Well, guess what, it gets
           old after the first movie.7.CHETI just got head. I'm totally Riggs.
          Will shakes his head, turns and walks off.INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - DAYWill wakes up, legs dangling over the edge of a tiny couch.
          His TV is still on, displaying the menu screen from a porn.
          Will looks down at his coffee table. Clears some magazines
          to reveal a file folder. Flips the cover -
          It's full of college applications, drafts of admissions essays,
          a junior college transcript. Will thumbs through one of the
          glossy applications. The kids look young. Very young.
          Will glances over at a picture on his wall: he and Chet at
          high school graduation, looking just as young. They have
          their arms around a pretty girl squeezed between them. Will
          and the girl look very high and very happy.
          Will shuts the folder, slides it back under the coffee table
          debris. He looks over at a clock: it is already 2:00 PM.WILLFuck.INT. MUSTANG - DAYWill jumps in and starts the engine. As he tucks his
          "Giorgio's" cap onto his head, he catches his reflection in
          the rear-view mirror.WILLYou asshole. You titanic asshole.
           Come on down and get your prize.

          surplus cap. He carefully rigs homemade explosives to another
          watermelon, then looks up at Dwayne. His eyes are magnified
          into saucers by his thick glasses. There's a peculiar
          eagerness to please in them.JAYThis one's gonna blow even bigger.DWAYNEBoy, if you weren't such a skinny
           little bitch you coulda been in the
           military or something.JAYWhatever. I don't need the military.

           eat pussy. And cut my own hair.
                         
          Jay jogs the watermelon a safe distance away. He returns
          and pulls out a detonator. Dwayne snatches it.DWAYNEThis one's all me.

           about physical fitness. You gotta

           I'm clearly in the bulk up phase. I
           told you to watch Pumping Iron like

          Dwayne reaches out, "touching" the 3D images. He stands and

          Standing by the switch is Dwayne's dad, JERRY (70s). Most
          people just call him "THE MAJOR." The faded USMC tattoo on
          his thick forearm explains why.JAYAfternoon, Major.
                         
          Dwayne flops back onto the couch.DWAYNEDad, we're watching a flick. We got
           45 minutes and a potential 3D sex

          gets right in his face...scary, intense. Dwayne turns to Jay.DWAYNELet's get outta here. This movie
           sucks anyway.
                         
          Jay gets up and files out the door. Dwayne goes to take the
          cold cut plate. The Major grabs his arm.MAJORI paid for the damn cold cuts, too.

          his heart out to her.
                         
          Somewhere in the background, Jay hangs at the bar, all alone.DWAYNE- and he thinks he knows me. He

          This piques Juicy's interest.JUICYWhat kinda inheritance?12.DWAYNEWhen my dad got outta the service, he

           family matter...but killing your old
           man? That's pretty messed up...I
           mean, unless you think it isn't.DWAYNEWhat we have here is a classic "lesser
           of two evils" debate. You got one
           evil: me shaving a few years off The
           Major's shitty life. Then you got
           the other evil: The Major ruining my
           entire awesome life by blowing through
           my inheritance. Maybe I'm biased,
           but mine sure as shit seems like the
           lesser.JAYI guess I...sorta see where you're
           coming from. And you have been
           waiting around forever for that money.
           You deserve it, Dwayne.
                         
          Dwayne nods, seriously.DWAYNEYou know, there's a reason I sleep
           'til noon everyday. And it ain't
           'cause I'm lazy. It's on account of
           me having so many goddamn dreams.
           Big ones. And once that money's
           mine, they're all gonna come true.
                         
          Dwayne takes a long sip of beer, contemplative.DWAYNELike I had this one dream last night.
           I was cruising through town in a
           Lamborghini Diablo. The wind was
           blowing through my hair, ruffling my
           open shirt. There was a hot little
           piece of ass sitting next to me. And
           in the back seat, Jay...was you.
           Strapped. Wearing a pair of Oakleys.JAYWow. I didn't know you dreamt about
           me, Dwayne.DWAYNEIt was only this once, Jay. To be
           honest, I didn't know what to make
           of it. So I consulted my dream book,
           and found out it means this: you're
           my road dog. You got my back.(MORE)17.DWAYNE (CONT'D)That's why I want to make you my
           partner.JAYIn what?DWAYNEIn crime. And business. You see, it
           ain't just about the inheritance money.
           It's about what I'm gonna do with it.
                         
          Dwayne leans across the table.DWAYNEI'm about to clue you in on something.
           And then you'll understand the true
           magnitude of what's at stake here.
           Are you ready?JAYYes. I'm totally ready.DWAYNEThen answer me this...what's this
           town missing? I'll give you a hint.
           It's a cash business, crawling with
           sexy bitches.JAY(BEAT)A Chinese food restaurant?DWAYNENo. A tanning salon.(BEAT)Think about it. All that green.
           All that brown flesh.
                         
          Jay nods, thinking about. He smiles.DWAYNEIt's also the perfect front for a
           prostitution ring.JAYYeah, of course. Because of the booths.DWAYNEYes. And because of the bitches.(BEAT)It can all be ours. 30 percent for
           you, 70 percent for me. You just
           gotta help me out here.18.Jay looks conflicted. Dwayne goes dark, like a spurned lover.DWAYNEI'm starting to wonder if my dream
           book was wrong about you. Maybe you
           sitting behind me doesn't mean you're
           my road dog. Maybe it means you're
           plotting to stab me in the back,
           like some snake in the grass.JAYThat's crazy. I'd never do something
           like that. The dream book was right!
                         
          Jay looks Dwayne in the eyes, knows it's all or nothing...JAYOk. I'll do it. But I'm not shooting
           him or anything. I'll hold him while
           you shoot him. That's it.
                         
          Dwayne chuckles.DWAYNEHere's a fact: they don't build prisons
           for criminals, they build them for
           idiots. Shit, they got three different
           types of CSI on TV, just laying out
           how the police do their business...and
           still, idiots like you think you can
           just go out and do a murder yourself.(BEAT)If you wanna be a millionaire, you
           gotta think like one. And
           millionaires don't kill people.
           They hire assassins. Which I did.
           We gotta pay him on Tuesday.JAYWhat? Why would you do that?DWAYNEI was presented with an opportunity.
           I took it. 100 thousand bucks for a
           highly trained assassin is a steal.JAYBut we don't have that kinda money.DWAYNENow we're addressing the real problem:
           how do we get the 100 grand? 'Cause
           once we get that, we get the million.(MORE)19.DWAYNE (CONT'D)And once we get the million, we will
           literally own this town and every
           single thing in it.JAYI guess we could just...rob a bank.
           One of these local banks with nothing
           but a dipshit security guard.DWAYNEAgain, not quite thinking like a
           millionaire.JAYOkay, then let's hire someone to rob
           a bank.
                         
          Dwayne thinks about this for a second.DWAYNEFuck hiring them, we could just force
           someone to rob a bank for us. Like
           with blackmail, or death threats, or -JAY(ALMOST INVOLUNTARILY)A bomb. Everyone's scared of a bomb.DWAYNEI was gonna say hypnotism...but I
           like that. It's out of the fucking
           box. We just strap one to some
           motherfucker's chest, like we did to
           those watermelons. Think you can
           you build some kinda bomb vest?JAYYeah, I mean...camel jockeys do it
           in caves. I got a garage workshop.DWAYNEI'm pretty sure this is exactly how
           a millionaire would do it. And the
           beauty of it is: we don't lose any
           sleep, 'cause no one gets hurt.JAYExcept The Major.DWAYNEYeah. The Major dies. But no one
           gets hurt.
                         
          Dwayne smiles. But a nagging thought interrupts him -20.DWAYNEThere's just one problem. Where do
           we get our guy? 'Cause if we do a
           kidnapping, then we're right back
           where we started...doing shit that's
           gonna get us caught.(MIND WORKING)What we need is someone to come to

          The guys stare at each other, stumped. Until something
          catches Dwayne's attention...a local commercial playing on

          Murtaugh (Danny Glover) has just stopped Riggs (Mel Gibson)

           off to it afterwards. He's gay.CHETI hope he chokes on a dick. I never

          Chet chuckles. Will ignores him, sips his beer.WILLThe point I'm trying to make is this:
           Tom Small was an asshole. He was
           totally wrong for your sister. Just

          Jay is right on Will's tail. Without breaking stride, Jay
          picks up a large branch and wings it at him.
                         
          Will is hit in the legs and stumbles over himself. Jay leaps

          rag. He presses it hard against Will's mouth and nose.
          Will soon goes limp.

          Jay carefully unbuttons the Army jacket. Will is, in fact,
          wearing an explosive vest. It is a cobbled together but
          intimidating looking contraption, crisscrossed by multicolored

          He hands Will a slip of paper.DWAYNEOnce you have the money, call this

          Dwayne looks over to where an oversized stuffed bear, rigged
          with its own bomb vest, sits on a tree stump 20 yards away.
          Dwayne mimes answering a phone -DWAYNEHey, Teddy Ruxpin...what's that?
           You don't have the money? It was
           too tough to rob the bank, so you
           just went back to your bear cave and
           cried like a bitch? Well, guess
           what my stuffed friend...time is up.
                         
          Jay pushes a button on a detonator. Teddy Ruxpin explodes.
          All that remains is a cloud of stuffing.
                         
          Will is frozen in fear.DWAYNEI liked that bear. I don't even
           know you.
                         
          Dwayne throws Will his car keys.DWAYNEGo on. Get outta here.WILLGuys, can we please just talk about
           this?32.DWAYNEYeah, of course we can.
                         
          Dwayne pulls out the gun and fires two shots at Will's feet.
          Jay jumps backward, as does Will, who hits the hood of his
          car, slides across it and onto the ground by the driver side.DWAYNEBe careful!
                         
          Will awkwardly gets to his feet and arranges himself in the
          car, adjusting to the weight of the bomb. As he starts the
          engine and backs away -DWAYNEThat's right! Get the fuck out of
           here! You're wasting time!
                         
          Once the car is gone, Jay yanks off his gorilla mask. Dwayne
          stays primate.JAYWhat the hell, Dwayne? You told me
           that was a replica gun.DWAYNEIt was. Then I paid a Mexican 50
           bucks to put a firing pin in it.

          Chet, who stands uncertainly by the passenger side.CHETThis is the world's biggest favor,

           help me move last winter.

          Will pulls out of the school parking lot.WILLOkay, so where are we going?CHETI have no idea. I just got in your
           car. I thought you had a plan.40.WILLWell, I don't! I've been sorta
           preoccupied with this crushing fear
           of death!CHETNo plan. I can't say I'm surprised.WILLYour plan is probably better. Just
           condescend me until I explode.
                         
          Will goes to turn on the radio. Chet grabs his hand.CHETMaybe we should turn on the radio.
           See if the signal sets the bomb off.
           That would be an interesting experiment.
                         
          Will heaves a frustrated sigh. Chet eases up.CHETListen, let's just go back to my
           place. Figure out our options.
           Maybe you can get the vest off or
           something. I just don't want to do

          jacket off and we get our first complete look at the vest.
          The actual structure is composed of hollow metal tubes. The
          wiring that runs throughout the vest is messy and complicated,
          purposely so, to scare anyone out of fucking with it.

           shoulder?42.WILL (O.S.)Fuck you!CHETWell, all these sites say different

           know, they're outside right now.

          Will stares at Chet, hopelessly overwhelmed.WILLWhat do I do, man? What do I do now?CHETI don't know, Will...I guess you
           gotta rob the bank.WILLI haven't been inside a bank in three

          Will drops onto the couch and puts his head in his hands,
          fighting hysterics. Chet offers a stock reassurance -CHETIt's gonna be okay.WILLNo, it's not! I'm gonna blow up!
           That's way worse than getting stabbed
           or shot. At least some people survive
           that. No one survives being blown
           up.(MORE)43.WILL (CONT'D)No one is ever like, "Yeah, I heard

           eardrum.CHETSorry. Shit. I didn't mean to do
           that. But just listen to me now.
           You're not gonna die. You wanna

           how to rob a bank.WILLWhat are you talking about?CHETPoint Break.WILLThe movie?CHETYes. That movie is like a how-to

           You get benefits.WILLLike what, a name tag?CHETWhat kind of benefits do you get?
           Free toppings?WILLThat's really clever. No one ever
           said that shit to me before. Anyway,

           layout of the bank.CHETNot exactly. They didn't hand me
           the security schematics with the
           application. But I sat in the waiting
           area for like 20 minutes. I know

           Just leave the rest of the money

          Nothing. The Major gets up and goes to a desk, rifles through

          Vaughn shakes his head. Almost imperceptibly, The Major
          repositions the hand with the pen in it. Vaughn is about to
          squeeze the trigger -
                         
          But The Major beats him to it, clicking the pen, which is
          actually a pen gun. It fires a .22 caliber round into Vaughn's
          neck. He drops the gun and clutches the geyser of blood.
                         
          The Major charges Vaughn, jumps on him and wrestles him to
          the ground, trying to jam the pen into the wound in his neck.MAJORI'll ride you all the way to hell!

          he whips it across The Major's face, knocking him backwards.
                         
          Vaughn scrambles to his feet, gun pointed at the felled Major.VAUGHNWhat now, old man!? You can't kill

          stop and look out at him like guard dogs.
                         
          Vaughn ransacks the place. He finds a desk drawer locked.
          Takes out his gun and blows it open.
                         
          Vaughn pulls a stuffed file folder out of the drawer. Flips
          through it. It's full of details about Dwayne's plan, the

          radio tower. PUSH IN on the radio tower.
                         
          Vaughn stuffs the map into his pocket. He stops before leaving
          the room, turns and shatters the fish tank with the butt of
          his gun. Water spills out and the Chinese Fighting Fish flop
          onto the floor. As Vaughn lifts a boot to stomp them -EXT. ROAD - DAYWill and Chet are still arguing -CHETLook at the upshot, while you're

          shining in his eyes.JAYHey...on your forehead.

          Without warning, Vaughn cracks Will over the head with the

          points the gun at her and she shuts up.
                         
          Dwayne steps forward with the bag.DWAYNEIt's all good. We got your money.VAUGHNNice mask, Dwayne. Now throw the

          Panicked, Dwayne's eyes flash over to Jay, who tightens his
          grip on the flamethrower handle. Jay catches Dwayne's eye.

          ground, intermittently firing, while Jay screams and tries
          to torch him with the 25-foot flame. A hand touches Kate's

          It doesn't make a sound for two reasons. The second being
          that it's out of bullets.
                         
          Dwayne fumbles for his own hardware. Muzzle flash.102.Vaughn drops to his knees. Pulse snatched from him.

          over to see his friend in flames, flailing his arms and
          shrieking. Dwayne's head snaps to the other side, where he

          From where his head has landed on the floor, Dwayne sees
          something odd...long red streaks. He crawls forward on all
          fours to investigate...
                         
          It is a trail of sticky red blood. Dwayne follows it until

          father's face is white, he's lost a lot of blood, but he
          isn't totally spent yet. He struggles to speak -MAJORDwayne...DWAYNEWhat happened to you?MAJORSome guy...said you hired him to

          The Major nods. Opens his hand. Reveals a cordless phone.
          Dwayne looks to the bloody streaks down the hall, leading to
          the phone table. The Major dragged himself the whole way.MAJORMedics are late...probably a couple
