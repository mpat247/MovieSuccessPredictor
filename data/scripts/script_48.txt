Martha watches intently as 3 nuns, the Mother Superior, Sister

out, cigarette

Soeurs de Marie Madeleine". Martha jangles a bell. After a wait she
presses a buzzer. A   peephole in the door slams open and Sister
Marguerite looks out.MARTHABonjour, I'm Doctor Martha

       Martha and the Sister walk up the drive to the convent.17   INT - WAITING ROOM - DAYMartha follows Sister Marguerite into a grilled waiting room.
Sister moves    off, leaving Martha looking around curiously. Then
the MOTHER MIRIAM arrives from behind the grilled door, sees
Martha, sighs exasperatedly and enters giving Martha a slight
start.MOTHER SUPERIOR(beaming at her own

       Then Mother Miriam walks out.18   INT - WAITING ROOM - DAYA little later, Martha is sitting alone smoking. SISTER ANNE
enters and indicates that Martha should follow her. They exit out of
the grilled room
        and head up a steep flight of wooden stairs. Faintly the
voice
of a single
        young woman can be heard singing in Latin.19     INT - TOP CORRIDOR - DAYMartha follows Sister Anne down the hall towards the singing.
They stop outside Agnes' room. Martha looks to see...20     INT - AGNES' ROOM - DAY... Agnes an almost childlike young woman singing happily,
looking out the
        window. Then Agnes hears a slight sound and stops abruptly.
She
turns to see
        Martha standing in the doorway.MARTHAHello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been
                         asked to talk to you. May I?AGNESYes.

outside
the door.MARTHAYou have a lovely voice.AGNESNo I don't.MARTHAI just heard you.AGNESThat wasn't me.MARTHAWas it Sister Marguerite?

                       She lived here for almost seventy
                       years. Every day she'd ring the bell,
                       wake us up, call us to God. She took
                       me to my secret place.MARTHAWhere's that?... I promise I won't tell,
                       would you take me?So Agnes takes her.44   INT - BELL TOWER - DAYMartha and Agnes enter the bell-tower. Agnes leads the way up
the steep wooden steps. Martha becomes breathless almost
immediately.MARTHASister Paul was in her eighties?   Did
                       she climb up here often?AGNESNo, only when she felt like it. She
                       brought me up here last winter and
                       the next day she died.MARTHA(halting, out of breath)

                       drop them. They have a soft spot on
                       their heads and if you drop them so
                       they land on their heads they become
                       stupid. I was dropped on my head,

                       Numbers... you can spend your whole

                       I don't understand them either. Do
                       you suppose I was dropped on my head?AGNESI hope not. It's a terrible thing to be
                       dropped on your head.MARTHAOh, I've got to give up smoking. Agnes
                       ... wait a minute... Agnes slow down.45   EXT - TOP OF BELLTOWER - DAYAgnes climbs up through the trapdoor to the bell platform.AGNESShe said you could see the whole
                       world from up here. But it looks
                       much better far away than it looks
                       close up.

       Martha arrives exhausted.MARTHABeautiful...

       Agnes lies down under the bell.AGNESAnd sometimes I get under here...
                       it makes a wonderful sound.

        She starts to sing in a beautiful voice and the sound rings
in
the bell.MARTHAWhat happens if the bell rings and
                       you're under there?AGNESOh, it's even more wonderful then.

       Agnes sings a little more.MARTHAIt's like hiding from my mother when
                       I was a little girl.AGNESWhere did you go?MARTHAOh, no place as wonderful as this.
                       Agnes... have you ever thought of
                       leaving the convent for something
                       else?AGNESNo. There is nothing else. Just being
                       here at night helps me sleep.MARTHAYou have trouble sleeping?AGNESI get headaches. Mommy did too...
                       oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew
                       things that nobody else knew.MARTHAWhat things?AGNESShe knew what was going to happen
               to me. That's why she hid me away.MARTHAHow did she know that?AGNESSomebody told her.MARTHAWho?AGNESI don't know.MARTHAAgnes...AGNESYou'll laugh.MARTHAI promise I won't laugh. Who told
               her?AGNESAn angel, when she was having one
               of her headaches.MARTHADid your mother see angels often?AGNESNo.MARTHADo you?AGNESNo.MARTHADo you believe she really saw them?AGNES(sitting up)

Martha moves round close to Agnes.MARTHAAgnes, did you love your mother?AGNESYes.MARTHADid you ever want to be a mother
yourself?AGNESI could never be a mother.MARTHAWhy not?AGNESWell I don't think I'm old enough and
besides I don't want to have a baby.MARTHAWhy not?AGNESBecause I don't want one.MARTHAIf you did want one, how'd you go
about getting one?AGNESFrom someone who didn't want to
have a baby.MARTHALike you?AGNES(suddenly frustrated)
No, not like me!MARTHAHow would that person get one if
they didn't want one?AGNES(jumping to her feet)
A mistake...MARTHAAgnes, how did your mother get you?AGNESA mistake... it was a mistake...MARTHAIs that what she said?AGNES(very upset)
                       If you're trying to get me to say that
                       she was a bad woman and hated me and
                       didn't want me but that's not true, she
                       was a good woman, a saint...

                       about sex...AGNESI can't help it if I'm stupid.MARTHA... that you don't remember getting
                       pregnant...AGNESNot my fault.MARTHA... and that you don't believe you
                       carried a child.AGNESI was a mistake.MARTHAWhat the child?AGNESEverything... I don't have children.MARTHAAgnes...

       Martha puts her arm out to Agnes who slaps it away.AGNESDon't touch me like that! You don't
                       touch me like that, I know what you
                       want from me, you want to take God
                       away. You should be ashamed, they
                       should lock you up people like you.

        Agnes disappears down through the trapdoor. Martha throws her
cigarette away.46   INT - CONVENT - DAYMother Miriam is comforting a tearful Agnes. She sees Martha
coming across   the courtyard and pushes Agnes gently away.MOTHER MIRIAMYou hate us don't you?MARTHAWhat?MOTHER MIRIAMNuns... you hate nuns.MARTHAI hate ignorance and stupidity.MOTHER MIRIAMThe Catholic Church...MARTHAI haven't said anything against the
                       the Catholic Church.MOTHER MIRIAMCatholicism is not on trial here. I

                       this case over to someone else...MARTHAHow dare you tell me to run my affairs!

       Mother Miriam starts to walk away, Martha angrily follows
her.MOTHER MIRIAMIt's my affair too.MARTHAHow dare you think I'm in a position
                       to be pressured...MOTHER MIRIAMI'm only interested...MARTHA...    or bullied or what ever you're doing.

                       the    way you treated this child.

        Martha and Mother Miriam are climbing the stairs. They pause
briefly.MOTHER MIRIAMShe is not a child.MARTHAAnd she has a right to know that there's
                       a world out there filled with people who
                       don't believe in God...(Mother Miriams walks on)
               ... and aren't any worse off than you

               fall in love and have babies and occas-

                       would sleep in their own coffins.

        Sister Marguerite gives a snort of derision. Mother Miriam
glances sharply
        at her, then turns back to Agnes.MOTHER MIRIAMWe're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.AGNESIt made them holy.MOTHER MIRIAMIt made them uncomfortable. And ifthey didn't sleep well I'm certain the

                       to me in tears, asking for comfort,
                       comfort because she was too old to
                       have any children. Not that she wanted

Sister   Marguerite and Mother Miriam. Justice Leveau is summing
up.LEVEAUIn view of the situation as it now
                        stands, and the testimony given here
                        this morning, it seems quite clear
                        that the defendant was in no manner
                        responsible for her actions. It is
                        therefore the judgement of this court
                        that she be returned to the convent of
                        Marie Madeleine where she will be cared
                        for under proper medical supervision by
                        a visiting physician.

        Both Martha and Mother Miriam show relief at this. Justice
Leveau continues
        to sum up in French when suddenly Agnes stands up.

                        I stood in the window of my room
                        every night for a week. And one night
                        I heard the most beautiful voice
                        imaginable. And when I looked I saw
                        the moon shining down on him. For six
                        nights he sang to me, songs I'd never
                        heard. And on the seventh night he
                        opened his wings and lay on top of me.

court.DISSOLVE TO:92   EXT - CONVENT - DAYIt is full winter; many shots of the convent and surroundings
dissolving
        into one another.MARTHA (V.O.)I don't know the meaning behind the
                       song she sang. Perhaps it was a song
                       of seduction. And the father was a
                       fieldhand. Perhaps the song was simply
                       a lullaby that she remembered from many
                       years ago. And the father was hope and...
                       and love and desire. And a belief in
                        miracles.
