                        Bernardo Bertolucci & Franco ArcalliFINAL SHOOTING TRANSCRIPTFADE IN:EXT. PARIS FRANCE - PONT DE BIR-HAKEIM - DAYPAUL (50's) stands on the street under a RAISED TRAIN BRIDGE.
          He covers his ears in UTTER DISGUST at the UNBEARABLE NOISE a
          train makes as it ROARS OVERHEAD.
                         
          He BELLOWS TO THE HEAVENS.PAUL(ENGLISH)FUCKING GOD!!!!As the train moves on he walks, slowly, DESPONDENT. Lost in a
          private WORLD OF PAIN.
                         
          Behind him we see a woman in a fur collard coat and flowered
          hat walking, gaining on him. This is JEANNE (20's).
                         
          As she PASSES Paul, she turns to GLANCE at him. We read a
          HINT of EMPATHY on her face.
                         
          He is OBLIVIOUS to her or anything else for that matter.
                         
          She walks on, dodging STREET SWEEPERS as she covers the long
          walkway, trying to forget the SAD MAN she saw.
                         
          We see her walk toward a 6 story APARTMENT BUILDING.
                         
          Paul, with TEARS STREAMING DOWN HIS FACE, comes to reality as
          he also notices the building. He REGARDS it.CUT TO:EXT. APT. BUILDING - PASSEY - DAYJeanne stands looking at the grandeur of the building at 1
          RUE JULES VERNE. She reads a FOR RENT sign on the door frame.
          She HESITATES but then RINGS THE BELL. She checks her watch.
                         
          She SMILES to herself then descends the nearby stairs.
                         
          She goes into a BAR.CUT TO:INT. KENNEDY EIFFEL BAR - DAYJeanne comes in and speaks to the BARTENDER.2.DIALOGUE IS IN FRENCHJEANNEA phone token, please.BARTENDERNo tokens. At the end, on the left.JEANNEThank you.
                         
          Jeanne goes to the TELEPHONE/WASHROOM.
                         
          The telephone booth is OCCUPIED.
                         
          As she waits, she watches in disgust as an OLD LADY cleans
          her DENTURES with a toothbrush and then puts them back in her
          mouth.
                         
          Jeanne STUDIES her own face in the MIRROR, puffing her cheeks
          up in judgement. As she does, Paul exits the phone booth,
          still LOST IN ANGUISH.
                         
          After watching him leave, Jeanne USES THE PAY PHONE. She
          speaks to her MOM.JEANNE (CONT'D)Mama? Yes, it's Jeanne. I've found
           a flat to rent in Passy. I'm going
           to see it.
                         
          She puts her foot up on the seat. We see her LONG BOOTS as
          her SHORT SKIRT hikes up.JEANNE (CONT'D)Then I've got to go to the station
           to met Tom. I promised him. OK, see
           you later. Bye!CUT TO:INT. APT. BUILDING - FRONT DESKJeanne talks to THE CRAZY CONCIERGE through a SMALL WINDOW
          who is SMOKING and has ROLLERS in her hair.JEANNEI've come to see the flat. I saw
           the sign.CONCIERGEThe sign?3.JEANNEYes.
                         
          The Concierge joins Jeanne AT THE WINDOW.CONCIERGEIt's always the same! Nobody ever
           tells me anything.JEANNEI'd like to see it.CONCIERGEYou want to rent it?JEANNEI don't know yet!CONCIERGEThey rent, they leave and I'm the
           last to know. Do you think that's
           right?
                         
          She sits at her desk and PUTS OUT HER CIGARETTE.CONCIERGE (CONT'D)If you want to go up alone--
                         
          She looks through her KEYS...CONCIERGE (CONT'D)Go on. I'm afraid of spiders. The
           key is missing. Strange things
           happen.
          One of the APT. GUESTS puts an empty WINE BOTTLE outside
          their door. They both TAKE NOTICE.CONCIERGE (CONT'D)They drink six bottles a day.
                         
          Jeanne thinks the place is like a FUNNY FARM. As the
          concierge TRILLS OUT FIGARO, she gives up and walks away.CONCIERGE (CONT'D)Wait! Don't go! There must be a
           duplicate.
                         
          She looks for it.CONCIERGE (CONT'D)Here it is.4.Jeanne, against her better judgement, goes back to the desk.
          She holds out her hand. The Concierge puts the KEY IN HERHAND.CONCIERGE (CONT'D)You must be very young.
                         
          She GRABS AND HOLDS ON to Jeanne's hand way too long,
          LAUGHING CRAZY, HYSTERICAL. Jeanne has to forcefully break
          away from her grasp.JEANNELet go of me!
                         
          She gets free of her and heads to the ELEVATOR, rubbing her
          hand.JEANNE (CONT'D)She's crazy!
                         
          The ELEVATOR arrives and she gets on. We watch her ascend andDISAPPEAR.CUT TO:INT. APT. BUILDING - BEDROOMJeanne comes in the DARK ROOM and heads straight for the
          window. She opens it and the STORM SHUTTER.
                         
          Light STREAMS IN, revealing Paul, sitting on the RADIATOR.
                         
          Jeanne is STARTLED when she sees him.DIALOGUE IS IN FRENCHJEANNEWho are you?

           hear you come in.PAULI was already here.JEANNESorry? Oh it was you who took it. I
           had to bribe the concierge. These
           old houses are fascinating.
                         
          She walks up to the FIREPLACE.JEANNE (CONT'D)An armchair by the fireplace would
           look good.PAULThe armchair should go in front of
           the window.JEANNEAre you American? You've got an
           American accent.

          She continues to LOOK AROUND. Her CURIOSITY of Paul gets the
          best of her. She peeks around the corner and watches him SITIN THE CORNER.6.JEANNEWhat are you doing?
                         
          She thinks he is VERY ODD as he PLAYS WITH a lamp shade.

          toilet for a PEE. She looks around.
                         
          She finishes and FLUSHES THE TOILET as the PHONE RINGS ON
          incessantly.LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUSThe PHONE RINGS on...JEANNE (CONT'D)(PERTURBED)Oh la la. Should I answer It or

          He puts the SMALL LAMP SHADE back. He hangs the receiver on
          the back of the chaise. Jeanne continues to listen on her
          end, UNAWARE.
                         
          Paul SNEAKS AROUND THE CORNER.LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUSJeanne is STARTLED. She hangs up the phone.JEANNESo you're going to take it? You've
           decided?PAULI had already decided. But I'm not

           about it.PAULThink fast.
                         
          He WALKS OFF.
                         
          Jeanne picks her hat off the floor, lost in CONFUSION.
                         
          The front door SLAMS.
                         
          She walks toward the door...
                         
          But Paul didn't really leave. He walks slowly TOWARD HER.JEANNEI thought you'd left.
                         
          He STUDIES HER for a moment. He takes her hat and DROPS IT on
          the ground. He PICKS HER UP in his arms and CARRIES to the
          window. He puts her down on the window sill. They start
          MAKING OUT ferociously.
                         
          He RIPS her panty hose, UNDOES HIS ZIPPER and PENETRATES HER.
          They are lost in ANIMALISTIC SEX as she WRAPS HER legs around
          him.PAULAh... Oh, God.

          Totally spent, they ROLL AWAY from each other. Her skirt,
          hiked up is showing her ripped panty hose. We can see her
          AMPLE BUSH through the SHEER FABRIC.

          finds who she is LOOKING FOR, her boyfriend TOM (30's). She
          runs into his arms like LONG LOST LOVERS.
                         
          All of the sudden, a FILM CREW appears, filming their every
          moment.
                         
          They KISS PASSIONATELY.

          He KISSES HER...TOM (CONT'D)... it might be cinema. If I stroke
           your hair, it might be cinema.

           police wouldn't let me touch

          She rinses the blood FROM HER HANDS AND ARMS.CATHERINE (CONT'D)They were all spies! Asking if she

          An IRISH COUNTRY JIG plays over the MONOLOGUE.PAUL (CONT'D)One time I was all dressed up to go
           out and take this girl to a
           basketball game. And I started to
           go out and my father said, "You
           have to milk the cow." I said,
           "Would you please milk it for me?"
           And he said, "No, get your ass out
           there." So I went out and I was in
           a hurry and didn't have time to
           change my shoes. And I had cow shit
           all over my shoes. And on the way
           to the basketball game, it smelled
           in the car. I don't know. I-I can't
           remember very many good things.34.JEANNE'S VOICENot one?PAULYeah. Some. There was a farmer, a
           very nice guy. Old guy, very poor,
           and worked real hard. I used to
           work in a ditch, draining land for
           farming. And he wore overalls and
           he smoked a clay pipe. Half the
           time he wouldn't put tobacco in it.
           And I hated the work. It was hot
           and dirty and... it broke my back.
           And... all day long I'd watch his
           spit which would run down the pipe
           stem and hang on the bowl of the
           pipe. And I used to make bets with
           myself on when it was going to fall
           off. And I always lost. I never saw
           it fall off. I'd just look around
           and it'd be gone and then the new
           one would be there. And then we had
           a beautiful... My mother... My
           mother taught me to love nature.
           And... I guess that was the most
           she could do. And... we had... In
           front of our house we had this big
           field... meadow. It was a mustard
           field in the summer and we had a
           big black dog named Dutchy. And she
           used to hunt for rabbits in that
           field but she couldn't see them. So
           she'd have to leap up in this
           mustard field and look around very
           quickly to see where the rabbits
           were. And it was... very beautiful.
           And she never caught the rabbits.

           see. I don't have any stomping
           grounds. I don't have any friends.
           I suppose if I hadn't met you, I'd
           probably settle for a hard chair
           and a hemorrhoid. Anyway, to make a
           long, dull story even duller, I
           come from a time when a guy like me
