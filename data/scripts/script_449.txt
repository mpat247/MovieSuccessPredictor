FRIGHT NIGHTWritten by

                                   Marti NoxonEXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD -- NIGHTFADE UP:Moving through a tract development. The houses are like
          Mexican food -- the basic elements are all the same, just
          mixed differently.
          A gloomy night, no moon. And a slightly ominous pattern
          emerges...
          Green, thriving lawns and meticulously tended homes abut
          brown yards and porches littered with old newspapers and
          pizza joint flyers.
          Each third or fourth house is FOR SALE or, worse, seemingly
          abandoned. This area is in danger of becoming a ghost town.
          A deep, commanding voice pierces the silence:VOICE (O.S.)Defy reason. Defy everything you
          know.
          Now we move in on one of the homes. Not the nicest on the
          block, but inhabited. Lights on in the windows.INT. SUBURBAN HOME/VARIOUS -- NIGHTInside the house. A middle-class family lives here. The
          living room is empty, but the TV's on.ON THE TELEVISIONA commercial for PETER VINCENT. A Las Vegas institution,
          he's a magician whose show is all Gothic, horror-movie
          imagery.
          Peter's wiry, hot -- a rock and roll bad boy. He's cutting a
          girl up with a chain saw. And grinning like a mad man.TELEVISION ANNOUNCERPeter Vincent's "FRIGHT NIGHT."
          The family DOG is up on the coffee table eating what's left
          of a fast food burger and fries, still in the box.TELEVISION ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)Something's moving in the dark.2.Also on the table -- a role-playing game in progress.
          "Magic, the Gathering"... Elves and Wizards.TELEVISION ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)Only at The Hard Rock. Nightly
          Wednesday Through Sunday.
          Now we hear what at first sounds like a MUFFLED ARGUMENT
          coming from another room.DISTANT VOICEGet off her!!
          More voices yelling, something being thrown. An ugly
          domestic scene.
          We creep down a dark hall toward a cracked door, light seeps
          through the opening -- it SLAMS OPEN and ADAM, 17, crashes
          toward us.
          He's nice-looking, a little nerdy -- and he's in a blind
          terror.
          We get a glimpse of the horrible scene behind the door. A
          teen girl's room -- the sound of flesh ripping.
          We see a pale arm on the ground, shaking violently, as if
          something is tearing and tugging at the body attached to it.
          We bolt away with ADAM, who we now see is blood splattered,
          as he races UPSTAIRS. A PHONE CRADLE is ripped out of the
          wall, which Adam nearly falls over.INT. SUBURBAN HOME -- UPPER LANDING/BEDROOM -- NIGHTADAM RACES INTO HIS PARENTS' ROOM. Another horrible glimpse -
          - his mother's body splayed across her frilly bed.
          Blood on pale pink sheets.
          ADAM goes to his FATHER'S SIDE OF THE BED and now we see
          Adam's father's body. His father was reaching for A GUN he'd
          hidden under the bed.
          ADAM gets down under the bed, desperately reaches for the
          gun. It's just beyond his grasp.ADAMCome on, come on, come on...
          He gets it. But the GUN HAS A GUN LOCK. Adam has to dig in
          his dead father's pockets for his keys. Adam starts to cry.3.ADAM (CONT'D)Come on, come on!
          He finds them, struggles to unlock the gun with shaking
          hands.
          THE BED IS TURNED OVER in one violent throw. Adam is
          exposed. We see only a hint of the creature that looms overHIM --Brutally strong, veins dark and visible under the skin...
          Human but not quite.
          Adam reacts in horror. He knows he's dead.
          HE's RIPPED OUT OF FRAME as we hear:DISC JOCKEY (O.S.).we're looking at a nice day here
           in Clark County, hitting a season
          low of only 89 degrees...EXT. SHADOW HILLS - DAYMUSIC starts under the DISC JOCKEY as we LOOK DOWN FROM HIGH
          ABOVE at the SAME suburban neighborhood as before.
          In the daylight it seems nice. Charming, even.
          Pocket parks decorate almost every corner and kids ride bikes
          in the street. Mothers unload groceries. Neighbors chat.DISC JOCKEY (O.S.).so get out there and enjoy this
          beautiful Wednesday, people.
          We SWOOP CLOSER and find that RADIO comes from a passing
          MINIVAN with those cutesy stick figure family decals on the
          rear window.
          The FOR SALE SIGNS and brown lawns don't seem nearly so
          foreboding now.
          We SWOOP UP AGAIN and see beyond Shadow Hills, past the WALL
          that encompasses it -- and become aware for the first time
          that the community is SURROUNDED BY FLAT, ARID DESERT.
          In the distance, we can just make out the glow of Las Vegas
          proper. It looks like a distant fantasy, a land-locked
          Pleasure Island.4.EXT. STREET - DAYCLOSE ON:The wheels of a DIRT BIKE as it zooms down the street.
          WIDEN to see CHARLIE BREWSTER, who is PUSHING the bike as
          fast as he can. It STARTS, sputters -- then craps out.CHARLIE(to the bike/pissed)
          You want me to take you apart, huh?
          Charlie's 17 and has the slightly awkward feel of someone who
           just recently came into his body and good looks.
          He's a wry, thoughtful kid who's enjoying -- but not quite
          trusting -- a sudden surge in popularity.CHARLIE (CONT'D)(still talking to bike)
          I will. I'll sell you for parts.
          Don't think I won't--
          Charlie stops, embarrassed. DORIS -- a neighbor -- watches
           him talk to his bike. Paused as she hauls her trash cans to
          the curb.
          She's super pretty in a wholesome way -- except for her
          ridiculous body. Stripper city. She nods to the bike,
          amused.DORISNothing doing, huh?CHARLIEThe thing's got no ambition.
          (re: trash cans)
          Can I -- uh, give you a hand?DORISI got it. Thanks.
          She walks away -- her sweatpants have the word "LUCKY" across
          the butt. He watches her go appreciatively. Doesn't notice
          his mom, JANE, struggling to pull their own cans to the curb.JANEDon't leer at the neighbors, kid.
          Jane, 40's, attractive and frazzled, wears a REAL ESTATE
          brokers blazer. Charlie wheels his bike back to the curb.5.He and his mom have had an affectionate, teasing relationship
          which has only recently started to have more edge.CHARLIEShe's the one who put a word on her
          butt. I'm just reading it.
          Jane eyes a LARGE DUMPSTER FULL OF CONCRETE that sits in
          front of their NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR'S YARD.JANEIs he ever going to move that
          thing?CHARLIEYou need to get over it, Mom.JANE(WATCH IT)Attitude.
          (observes him/then)
          You've been tense or something.
          School?CHARLIESchool's great, actually.JANEAmy?CHARLIEGood. Hasn't dumped me yet.
          He says this like he's surprised. Jane nods. Getting it.JANEThat'll teach you to get so tall
          and handsome.(THEN)Getting what you want is stressful.
          Especially when you're not used to
          it. More to lose.CHARLIEAre you reading those books again?
          The Power of Whatever the Hell?
          She laughs. He glances at the DUMPSTER.CHARLIE (CONT'D)They're not working. You're still
          flipping out about a big box.6.Now Jane moves to the open garage and starts loading OPEN
          HOUSE SIGNS into her trunk. Charlie stands there. She
          shoots him a look -- then he helps her load.JANEIt's an eyesore. I'm trying to
          convince people to move in, not
          join the legions leaving town--CHARLIEIf you say "mortgage crisis" again
          I'm getting a new mom.JANEThe guy moves in and puts a giant
          trash can in his yard! When the
          Perry's lived there--
          Charlie has heard this before. It's a common refrain.CHARLIEThe Perry's were the greatest
          neighbors ever. But they moved. I
          thought you were happy their place
          finally sold.JANE(back on the neighbor)
          He's not digging a pool. Where do
          you think all that concrete's
          coming from?CHARLIEYou're spying on the guy now?JANEHe's thirteen feet from our house.
          That's not spying, that's
          observing.
          A BEETLE CONVERTIBLE pulls up. AMY drives and her two hot
          friends, CARA and BEE, sit in the back.AMYHi, Mrs. Brewster.JANEHi honey. Hi girls.
          ANY, 16, is a stunner. And she's as cool as she is beautiful
          -- the girl every other guy in school would die to be with.7.But Charlie is. And he can't believe his luck. Which puts
          him off his game. She makes him feel like he's always
          playing catch up.
          Charlie moves toward the VW. Jane calls after him.JANE (CONT'D)Oh hey -- Ed called. Again.CHARLIEOkay.JANEI'm tired of making excuses,
          Charlie. If you don't want to talk
          to him, would you please tell him?CHARLIEKinda defeats the purpose.
          He gets to AMY and the girls. Amy glances at the dirt bike.AMYStill can't get the bike started,
          huh?CHARLIEWow. No faith.AMYSo you don't need a ride.
          Amy calls his bluff and starts to drive off. Charlie grabs
          his backpack and RACES after her.CHARLIENo, hey, stop--
          She laughs, stops the car. Charlie tries to jump in and she
          drives again.CHARLIE (CONT'D)Come on! Hey!--
          Charlie runs and finally dives into the back headfirst. The
          girls are laughing.ON JANEWatching them drive off, gone in a cloud of teen spirit.8.INT/EXT. AMY'S CAR -- DAYThe Beetle zips through a commercial strip. More suburban
          paradise.
          Charlie's in the front seat now. Amy drives, one hand on the
          wheel. Casually drops one on Charlie's leg. Charlie tries
          to act casual, but he's stoked and... amazed.
          Cara half-sleeps in the back while BEE leans forward, flirty,
          and eyes Charlie's COLORFUL PUMA SNEAKERS. Charlie's a
          sneakerhead, a serious collector.BEETakes a man to wear purple, Chuck.AMYCharlie.BEEChuck likes it when I call him
          Chuck, right Chuck?
           Intimidated by these girls, he tries to form a witty retort.CHARLIEIt's -- they're not -- that's,
           like, puce? That's a macho puce.CARACan you stop someplace? I'm
          severely under-caffeinated.AMY(ignores her/to Bee)
          Did you see the poster for the
          formal? The theme is "Hope"?BEEI know. They asked me to be on the
          committee again but I was like --
          hope is completely 2008. Grow up.CHARLIEDid you suggest "Despair?" Nobody
          would see that coming. Or --
          global warming? Everybody has to
          wear tin foil.AMY(laughs/to Charlie)
          Did you go last year? We basically
          did the whole thing, Bee and me.9.CHARLIE(LIES)Me? I, ah, was in training that
          week. This big triatha--BEE(cutting him off)
          Chuck was still under his rock.
          We're so glad you crawled out.CARACaffeine!? Hello!CHARLIEI have Econ first period.
          Amy takes her hand off his leg. Charlie notices.CARACharrrliiieeeee.CHARLIE(KILLING HIM)Okay. Yeah. It's no big deal.
          Amy PULLS into a coffee place. Parks. The girls climb out.CARAThank you, Jesus.
          Amy catches Charlie looking at his watch, fidgeting.AMYYou're not going to flunk for
          missing Econ, Brain.CHARLIEBrain? I -- what? No, I'm--
          But she's already walking away.AMYFive minutes.
          He watches her move off, anxious and smitten.EXT. CLARK COUNTY HIGH -- COURTYARD -- DAYCharlie arrives with Amy, Cara and Bee -- all the girls now
          sport coffee drinks. Charlie has one too, with whipped cream
          and the works.10.Kids stream into a nice, modern-looking high school. Amy
          takes Charlie's arm.AMYOn time. You stress too much.CHARLIEI wasn't worried.AMYYou were doing your worried thing.CHARLIEI was? I have a -- what's my--MARK (O.S.)Ladies!
          A couple of handsome jock-type guys, MARK and BEN, roll up
          along side Charlie and the girls. They draw looks from other
          students as they move through the courtyard.
          The cool kids.BEEDoods. Looking massive.MARK(to Charlie/re: drink)
          Seriously? A Mochachino? You
          can't ride with the girls anymore.
          You let them brush your hair, My
          Pretty Pony?
          Mark grabs the cup away from him. Starts drinking it.BEE(takes his arm)
          Chuck's secure, aren't you?
          We see that Ben is also wearing PUMA's. Different design.
          It's a thing. Charlie shows his off -- he's secure.CHARLIEPuce.BENFuck yeah.AMY(TO CHARLIE)I have track after school, maybe we
          can hook up later?11.CHARLIEYeah. Hey. Come here.
          (pulls her aside/awkward)
          You know, the formal. Don't think
          I wasn't going to ask you, because
          I thought it was an obvious go.
          Together. Hope, puppies, kittens,
          the whole deal. You and me.AMY(NOT UNKIND)Oh, no. Please. Nobody goes to
          the dance senior year.
          She smiles, moves off. He watches her, lets out a breath.CHARLIERight. I knew that.
          MARK and BEN enjoy the view as the girls move off. Wow.
          Mark, incredulous, says to Charlie:MARKDid you find a frickin' Genie lamp
          man? Make a sacrifice to the hot
          ass Gods? How do you get that?CHARLIEGame, my friend. Rock solid.
          Charlie moves off. And even though he's playing it off, we
          see that Mark's hit a nerve. This hot girlfriend thing is a
          bitch. Mark calls after him--MARKYou don't even have a car!INT. CLARK COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL -- DAYLater. Charlie's in Econ class. Seated in a back row near
          MARK and BEN. A number of seats in class are EMPTY.TEACHERBen Wegner?BENHere.TEACHERAdam Noris?
          Nothing. Teacher looks around.12.TEACHER (CONT'D)Adam?
          (marks chart/then)
          Courtney Heuer?
          A girl raises her hand.
          Charlie, bored, idly checks out the class. Stops when he
          sees a tweaked-looking kid, ED, staring at him.
          EVIL ED is a slight, faintly punk-looking kid who's been
          picked on by bullies his whole life.
          He's hyper-intelligent, hyper-critical and... just hyper. And
          his binder is covered with COMIC BOOK STICKERS.TEACHER (CONT'D)Nick Straley?(NOTHING)Nick?
          Ed sees that he's caught Charlie's eye. Nods significantly
          at him. Like -- "you know and I know..."
          Charlie looks away. As if he didn't see him.INT. CLARK COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL -- DAYCharlie, Mark and Ben move down the hall. Mark shows Charlie
          a picture on his phone. A woman posing seductively.MARKMiss Granada. Geometry.CHARLIEHoly crap. Where did you get that?MARKShe's hard up, man. Equations
          don't keep you warm at night.
          They stop, see EVIL ED approaching. This amuses Mark and
          Ben. But Charlie's uncomfortable -- wants to bolt.BENI think "it's" going to talk to us.ED(TO CHARLIE)I need a minute.MARK"It's" going to talk to Brewster.13.BEN(TO ED)When are you going to get the
          message? We don't know you--ED(RE: CHARLIE)He does. Or did. Before the
          summer and his Jock Lobotomy.CHARLIE(to Ed/uncomfortable)
          What's the deal, man?EDAlone.
          Ed stares Charlie down. A beat. Ben and Mark bust out
          laughing. Mark looks at Charlie.MARKJust the two of you. That's sweet.
          He can school you in the ways of
          geek-douchery.EDIt's important. "Brewster."
          The way Ed says his name is enough to propel Charlie into
          action. He grabs Ed and pulls him aside. Mark and Ben watch
          with interest -- out of earshot.
          Ed's tone is dire, serious as a heart attack.ED (CONT'D)Adam's missing.
          Charlie's looking around, self-conscious.CHARLIEWhat do you mean, he's missing?EDI keep trying him -- nothing. No
          texts, no phone. And he's not the
          only one who's gone. You heard
          roll call.CHARLIESo kids aren't coming to school.
          What do you want me to do about it?14.EDMeet me at his house after school.
          We'll check around. See what's up,
          if he's okay.CHARLIEI can't after school. I'm busy.EDI don't think you get what I'mTELLING YOU--CHARLIELook, do we have to do this here?
          Ed can't believe it. Charlie's totally blowing him off. He
          starts to lose it, raises his voice--EDWhat, am I not even suppose to
          speak to you now?--CHARLIEKeep it down. Don't spaz--EDIt's so horrible! Crossing the
          streams! Will High School as we
          know it cease to exist?!
          Ed glances at Mark and Ben, who still watch from a distance.ED (CONT'D)You want me to tell your pals how
          well we know each other? The Lego
          contests, the Farscape conventions,THE COSTUMES--CHARLIEUIET--EDOr how your first sexual experience
          was with an Electra figurine--CHARLIENo. No.EDThen be my backup.CHARLIE(DEFEATED)Fine. Adam's after school.15.EDDon't be late.
          Moves off. Charlie sees the guys watching him. A beat. He
          shrugs like "I have no idea what that was about..."FADE TO:EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- FRONT LAWN -- DUSKThe sun has set behind the mountains. It's gloomy gray out,
          right before dark.
           Charlie and AMY park, climb out of her car with drinks from
           PLANET SMOOTHIE in hand. She's still in her track and field
          clothes. Looks tough.AMYYou know what I want? For dinner?CHARLIEYou're eating right now, you know.
          As you speak. You literally just
          forced me to get you a smoothie so
          large they named a planet after it--AMY(LAUGHS)I ran six miles. What did you do?CHARLIEI -- watched you. But not in a
          creepy way.
          Charlie winces a little. It sounds creepy.AMYSo don't judge. You don't want me
          to burn my big ole' booty off, do
          you?
          Charlie, on impulse, stops her -- kisses her.AMY (CONT'D)What was that for?CHARLIEI don't know you're just...AMYWhat?16.CHARLIE(PERFECT)Nothing.
          A sweet moment. These two have a definite thing. It's real.
          They're about to kiss again when JANE'S GIRLISH LAUGH stops
          them. They both turn and REACT AS THEY SEE...
          A MUSCLED MALE, SQUATTING AND HUNCHED-OVER -- clad only in a
          white wife-beater and jeans. We can't make out his face.
          Jane stands over him, laughing at something he's said as he
          FIXES their sprinkler.
          PUSH IN as the guy looks up. This is JERRY. 30's. Handsome
          to the point of devastating. An all-American Adonis.AMYWow.CHARLIELook at Mom. She's—AMYDamn right. If he followed her
          home, you have to let her keep him.
          Amy laughs -- almost skips toward them, milking the moment.EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE -- DUSKED paces anxiously in front of ADAM'S HOUSE. He has a duffle
          bag over his shoulder. Keeps checking his phone.
          He finally dials in a number. Talks--ADAMCharlie. I'm in front of Adam's.
          Remember the videos we all made
          back when? You and me and Adam,
          bro? In tights. Want your pals to
          get a load of that?EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- FRONT LAWN -- DUSKAmy and Charlie approach Jane and Jerry. They overhear--JANE.so not a pool, what's the work
          you're doing?17.Jerry has an easy-going way about him. An inviting charm.JERRYFoundation problems. I had to rip
          up half the basement.JANEThese houses were built practically
          overnight. I'm never surprised
          when they come apart.JERRY(RE: SPRINKLER)Done. Just needed a new stem.
          Jane sees Charlie and Amy approaching. And gaping.JANEJerry, this is my son Charlie. And
          his -- do we say girlfriend now?CHARLIE(EMBARRASSED)I guess. I mean -- only if she's--
          Amy's amused at Charlie's squirming, finally saves him.AMY(shakes Jerry's hand)
          Hi. I'm Amy.
          He can't help but give Amy an appreciative once-over. She
          enjoys it, but pulls away and moves closer to Charlie.
          Charlie notices the exchange -- the way this dude oozes
          manliness. Doesn't like it one bit. He shakes Jerry's hand
          a little too firmly. Lowers his voice a bit.CHARLIEHey.JANEJerry's our new neighbor. The
          Perry place. He's "handy."AMY(looks to Charlie, smiles)
          No kidding.JERRYSorry about the mess, man. I was

          Charlie looks at Jane, thanks for embarrassing me.JERRYWell -- they're bold. I like them.
           Jerry looks back at Jane. A little flirtatious.JERRY (CONT'D)So... I'd ask you guys inside, but

          Jane, Amy and Charlie walk toward the house. Jerry moves
          off. Amy looks at Jane, amazed.19.AMYWhy did you blow him off? Oh my
          God!JANEA guy that good-looking, still
          single? Bad bet. He's a player.CHARLIE(IMPRESSED)Mom. Breaking it down.JANEI've had enough man trouble. I'm

          He's flipping out.EDWhere the hell have you been?CHARLIEYou said after school, chill out!
          Ed is already lugging his big duffle to Adam's front door.EDRight after! It's dusk, dude, you
          know what that means!?CHARLIEThat the sun's gone down. What'sTHE BIG--Over him, Ed knocks loudly. Rings the bell.EDHey! Anybody home?
          A long pause. Nothing.CHARLIENot here. Let's go--
           But Ed's already heading around the house with the duffle.INT. ADAM'S HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- DUSKEd wriggles in through the DOG DOOR. He turns, lets Charlie
          in. Charlie looks around.CHARLIEThis is nuts.
          It's the SAME HOUSE we saw in the opening, but completely
          righted. TV is off, the walls are clean. Furniture in it's
          proper place. It's perfect.
          They move into the house. Ed is wired, scared.21EDHello? Ed and Charlie here!(TO CHARLIE)Come on.
          Charlie follows him in. Resigned and placating.CHARLIEOkay. Fine.
          Ed opens his duffle bag. Inside are CROSSES, STAKES, HOLY
          WATER, even a small AX.EDTake this.
          Ed hands Charlie a STAKE. Charlie eyes it, incredulous.CHARLIEYou've got to be kidding me.
          Ed stops. This is it.EDI hate to tell you this but that
          guy, your neighbor.(DEAD SERIOUS)He's a vampire. One of the undead.CHARLIEMy neighbor. Next door.EDYeah.CHARLIEI just met him. Jerry.EDJerry.

          "Jerry." Seriously--EDI didn't name him, man, I'm just
          reporting the facts!
          Ed moves UP THE STAIRS. Charlie reluctantly follows. It's
          darker up here. Lights off.22.CHARLIECome on, this is a gag -- right?
          Ed's barely listening -- cautious. Every shadow is potential
          death. Total shmuck bait...EDHey! Anybody here?
          They pass the empty MASTER BEDROOM -- where we saw ADAM's
          parents slaughtered. Now its clean and empty.
          Then Ed turns into ADAM's room. It's full of geekery.
          Action figures, the like. Charlie sticks behind him.
          The guys don't register the mostly obscured form of SOMEBODY
          HIDING BEHIND the door. A LARGE MALE figure.
          Ed catches sight of the guy, and SPINS toward it, freaked.
          Charlie also reacts, scared.ED (CONT'D)Get back, demon!
          Ed thrusts his cross forward which knocks the door open,
          toppling A MOVIE CHARACTER STANDEE.
          A beat. Then Ed lets out a slightly manic laugh.ED (CONT'D)Ha! I killed that sucker dead!CHARLIE(ANGRY)They're not here, okay? They left
          town. His dad was a deadbeat--
          Ed pulls a MAP out of his pocket. It has lots of red and
          black DOTS marked on it. He thrusts it at Charlie.EDNo, see, it's not just them. It
          started -- there was this thing on
          Channel 13, a lady escaped an
          attacker who tried to bite her.
          Ed points to the RED DOTS on his chart. They form a loose
          circle around CHARLIE'S house.ED (CONT'D)Adam and me, we graphed the attack,
          the disappearances. Whole

          mocking you. You've been reading

          real monster. And he's not

          move on until everyone around him
          is dead.(MOST EMPHATIC)And that book SUCKS.
          Charlie can't help but pause. Ed's conviction is so real.
          But he shakes it off.CHARLIECOME ON--EDWhat about your neighbors, the
          Perrys? He moved into their house.
          Haven't seen them around, have you?CHARLIEYeah, in San Diego like a month
          ago!EDException, proves the rule. You

          take my word, but I have evidence
          at home. Hard evidence.
          Charlie stops fighting it and humors him. Ed's lost it.CHARLIEYeah. Okay.ED(INTENSE)We have to stake him in his nest.
          You and me. Not now, it's dark.CHARLIERight. Cause he's nocturnal.EDJust for -- okay -- for a minute

          don't want to, fine. But don't get

          Ed stops. Stung.EDRight. Got it. You're soooo cool
          "Brewster." Go ahead, join the

          make fun of her and her pals,
          remember? They're bimbos--CHARLIEShut up!
          Charlie barely refrains from hitting Ed. Instead he shoves
          him away. Ed stumbles. Falls.
          He looks up at Charlie, genuinely hurt and desperate.EDAdam's gone -- you act like it has
          nothing to do with you.(THEN/PAINED)We were inseparable, man.CHARLIEYeah. And you know when I got
          popular? The minute I stopped
          hanging out with you.
          Charlie takes off. Ed watches him go.FADE TO:EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS/VARIOUS -- NIGHTA while later. It's REALLY DARK now.
          Ed, gripping his duffle bag nervously, skates down a
          residential street. Houses here are spaced far apart and the
          lights in many of them are off.
          Ed is anxious, watchful. He knows it's not safe. Every dark
          corner is potentially the end of him.
          A few cars pass. Something moves behind him. Footsteps
          GAINING. Ed abandons his skateboard and BOLTS.
          A hand SLAMS on his shoulder, spins him around. IT's MARK,
          Charlie's pal from school.MARKYou crossed my yard. Tracked your
          nerdjuice all over it.26.EDSorry. Sorry--MARKMy mom works hard on that shit,MORON--Ed glances around nervously, it's dark and anything... else
          could be out there.EDCan you just hit me? I don't have
          time for the build up.
          (he steels himself)
          Go.MARKSeriously?EDJesus, man! Just do it!
          Fine. Mark winds up and SWINGS -- a brutal blow.
          Ed DUCKS and runs. Mark's immediately on his heels.
          The guys dodge and dart through the neighborhood. But Ed has
          experience in the art of losing bullies and he manages to
          shake Mark for a moment.
          Ed scrambles over a wooden fence, but his DUFFLE BAG GETS
          CAUGHT ON TOP. Most of his vamp hunting stuff SPILLS over on
          the OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE.ED (CONT'D)Crap. Crap!
          There's not time to get the stuff. He can hear Mark
          approaching in the dark.
          He drops into a neighbor's backyard.EXT. BACKYARD -- NIGHTED spins and slams right into MARK -- no, it's JERRY.
          Ed falls back and scrambles away, terrified.ED (CONT'D)Get away! I'm armed mother fucker!
          Jerry moves after Ed, angry but controlled. More like a man
          than a monster.27.EXT. FENCE -- NIGHTMark pulls up on the other side of the wood fence. Sees Ed's
          VAMP HUNTING STUFF on the ground, laughs.MARKUnbelievable.
          A beat, Mark glances at the high fence. Decides he's done.
          He kicks some of Ed's stuff as he moves off.EXT. BACKYARD -- NIGHTEd trips over kid's toys and bikes as he runs to the house.
          There's a porch light on over the back door.ED(pounding on door)
          Hey! Let me in! Please!
          But there's no answer. Ed is desperate, Sees Jerry closing
          in, walking across the backyard.
          Ed takes a ROCK and smashes the window over the kitchen sink.INT. HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NIGHTEd falls through the window into the kitchen. Looks out.
          JERRY stalks toward him. All hulking menace.
          But Ed's safe now. Calls out--EDForget it sucker! No invite!
          BAM! Jerry kicks in the kitchen door. Ed, terrified, falls
          back.JERRYAbandoned. I thought you did your
          homework.ED-- what?JERRYYou've been watching me. I've been
          watching you. Seems fair.
          Ed BOLTS into the house.28.INT. HOUSE -- VARIOUS -- NIGHTAs he races through the empty rooms he pulls a stake from his
          pocket. We see he's wearing a cross around his neck on a
          long chain.
          JERRY's following, but barely breaking a sweat.
          Ed sees A SLIDING GLASS DOOR to the back. He fumbles with
          the lock, gets it open and runs into the backyard.EXT. BACKYARD -- NIGHTEd races for the back gate--AND SUDDENLY JERKS TO A STOP.Jerry has him by the back of the CROSS he's wearing.
          Ed's lifted WAY off his feet by the CHAIN, until he's choking
          on it, the cross directly under his neck.
          JERRY looks away as he SNAPS the chain off Ed and HURLS the
          cross into the neighbor's POOL.
          Ed falls to the ground, watches the cross sink in despair.
          Jerry's standing over him. Smiles a little. We get just a
          flash -- he suddenly has MORE TEETH, sharper, in rows. It's
          chilling.JERRYBit off more than you can chew.
          Shaking, terrified, Ed brandishes the STAKE.EDWe'll see, man. I know my shit.
          But Jerry doesn't appear to be afraid. He looks at Ed with
          actual sympathy.JERRYReally? Who's going to believe
          you? You see the truth, but what
          good is it when you're alone?
          Ed's shaken -- but still grips the stake. Holding on.EDDon't play that stuff. That mind
          crap. Come on -- try me. Try me!29.JERRYYou say you're glad you're
          different. But how can you be in a
          place like this? These people...
          Even your best friend. You're
          nothing to him now.
          Ed's listening despite himself, hurting now. Jerry moves a
          step in. Ed raises his stake again -- but with slightly less
          conviction.EDGet back!JERRYIt can be over. I can make all
          that pain go away.
          Ed's fighting tears. Life as he knows it is gone.EDNo...JERRYYou were born for this and you know
          it. Your "life", what you had?
          That's the illusion.
          (off Ed's silence)
          I can take you somewhere great.
          Somewhere you'll belong.
          Ed takes this in. His eyes clear a bit. Is it...hope?JERRY (CONT'D)It's a gift.
          And Jerry moves closer, blocking our view.CUT TO BLACK:FADE UP ON:EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- DAYA new day. Sunny and hot. A truck moves the DUMPSTER from

          printed off the internet, books, etc.

          kind of a "light domestic".. .mom.
          Charlie steps inside. Pointedly DOESN'T ask Jerry to enter.
          Charlie intentionally leaves the door open, moves to the
          refrigerator. But keeps his eyes on Jerry. If he steps in,
          uninvited, Ed's theory is blown.JERRYNice kitchen. Same floor plan as
          my place, huh?
          Jerry leans against the door jamb -- BUT DOES NOT CROSS THE
          THRESHOLD. Charlie observes this. Holy shit.
          Charlie and Jerry MEET EYES. Then a cold smile creeps over
          Jerry's face.
          Charlie fumbles, lets one of the wet beers slide from his
          hand -- it hits the ground, explodes.CHARLIEFuck!JERRYCan I help you with that?CHARLIENo! No. Thanks. I'll get it.
          Jerry takes in Charlie's frantic refusal. Now he's darkly
          certain. He's been made.
          Charlie tosses the broken bottle into the sink. Moves to the
          doorway with the remaining beers.
          Charlie hands them over the threshold. But doesn't cross.CHARLIE (CONT'D)There you go. Uh...party down.
          Jerry watches him, intense. His tone shifts -- cocky and
          intimidating. A threat disguised as "guy talk."JERRYThis girl tonight -- she's a
          handful. You know.(MORE)37.JERRY (CONT'D)Women who look a certain way, they
          need to be managed.CHARLIEYeah.JERRYYou don't mind my saying, you got a
          lot on your shoulders for a kid.
          Your pal, Amy? She's ripe. Must
          be a line of guys dying to pluck
          that. Your mom too -- you don't
          see it, maybe you do -- she's
          giving it off. It's on you to
          watch out for them. You up for
          that?
          Charlie's burning. But holds himself in check.CHARLIEI think I can manage.JERRYGood. Cause there are bad people
          out there, man. Better keep an eye
          on your women.
          Jerry backs away, intimidating even as he retreats.JERRY (CONT'D)Thanks for the beers.
          Charlie watches him move into the dark.INT. BREWSTER HOUSE - CHARLIE'S ROOM -- NIGHTCharlie bursts into his room, freaked out -- races to the
          window.
          His room is free of all geekery. Now it's all sports and
          sneakerhead stuff.
          AMY's there -- on his bed and surrounded by school books.
          She's reading Wuthering Heights.AMYWhere've you been? You told me to
          meet you here an hour ago.CHARLIE'S POVJerry's nowhere to be seen and his house is quiet. Lights on
          behind BLACKED OUT WINDOWS.38.AMY (CONT'D)Hello?
          Charlie breaks away from the window. It's an effort. His
          focus is still half there, even as he tries to talk to Amy.CHARLIESorry. You okay? Everything okay?
          He checks his phone. Checks for anything from ED. Nothing.AMYYeah. Why shouldn't it be?CHARLIENo, it should. Nothing.AMY(re: her book)

          Sexy, actually.
          Amy moves to Charlie. Puts her arms around him.AMY (CONT'D)In a frustrated, unconsummated sort
          of way.CHARLIELike us, you mean.
          Amy laughs, pulls him onto the bed. She's feeling frisky.AMYKinda makes it hotter.CHARLIEYeah, so you keep saying.
          He smiles a little. She kisses him. But feels his distance.AMYAm I boring you? What's up?CHARLIEWhat? No. I'm kind of wiped out,
          that's all.AMYI can fix that.
          She kisses him again. Despite himself, Charlie gets drawn in
          and turned on. She pulls back, serious.39.AMY (CONT'D)Want to get under the covers?CHARLIE-- now? Seriously?AMYCalm down. Let's just... see how it
          goes.
          Charlie's dying inside. Now?! Could not be a worse time.CHARLIEBelieveme when I say--thereis
          nothing in the worldI'dratherdoBUT--AMYCharlie. Don't be nervous.
          She kisses him again. It's intense, passionate. Charlie
          weakens a little. Maybe death and mayhem can wait...
          Amy moves to take off her top. Oh. My. God--
          DING DONG. Somebody is ringing the bell at Jerry's. Charlie
          stops. Practically tosses Amy off him.CHARLIEYou hear that?
          He rushes to the window. Looks outside.CHARLIE'S POVDORIS is at Jerry's front door. Holding a bottle of wine.CHARLIE (CONT'D)Shit.AMYWhat?
          JERRY comes to the door. He and Doris start chatting. She's
          flirting up a storm.CHARLIEShit, shit, shit--
          Amy sees what Charlie sees. Shrugs.AMYHe's hot. She's a stripper. They

          Jerry is showing Doris in when he stops-and looks DIRECTLY AT
          CHARLIE. It's chilling.
          Charlie DIVES away from the window, grabbing Amy and pulling
          her down too.CHARLIE (CONT'D)He looked right at us.AMYMaybe. Not a big deal--
          Charlie's freaked now. Doris is IN THERE.CHARLIENo, it is a big. A very big. He
          saw us and he was pissed.AMYOkay...
          Amy moves away. Looking at him skeptically.AMY (CONT'D)If you're not into this, say so.
          Don't do me any favors.CHARLIEWhat? No! I am, I totally am.
          just -- I don't trust that guy.
          He glances out the window again. Amy's irritated, not used
          to having her passes rejected. She gathers her stuff.AMYI'm going.CHARLIEAmy. Don't--41.AMYNo. You've got your neighborhood
          watch thing.CHARLIECome on, don't be that way--
          But she's gone.CHARLIE (CONT'D)Crap!
          A beat. Charlie's torn -- he should go after her. But
          Doris's muted LAUGH from the other house draws his attention.
          He looks again at Jerry's house. He can see faint shadows
          moving behind the windows in the house, like ghosts.
           Charlie's conflicted, freaked -- what can he do? He picks up
          the phone. Dials 911. Then thinks better of it. Hangs up.
          Finally -- he stops at the window, eyes on JERRY'S PLACE.
          Listening and watching intently. Keeping sentry.FADE TO:INT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- CHARLIE'S ROOM -- NIGHTLater. Charlie's fallen asleep in a chair by the window.
          He's startled awake by a woman's SCREAMS. They sound like
          they are coming from Jerry's.
          But are they screams of pleasure or pain?
          Charlie looks out the window. Jerry's house is dark. It's
          all quiet. Charlie looks at the clock. tam.
          Charlie sits back on his bed. Was it a dream? Then Charlie
          hears A MOTOR START. Charlie goes back to the window.
          Jerry's TRUCK starts and Jerry drives off.
          Off Charlie, unsettled.CUT TO:EXT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- BACKYARD -- NIGHTA short while later. Charlie moves cautiously into Jerry's
          backyard. He's wearing ALL BLACK and his dad's old winter
          gloves. He looks at his iPhone.
          ON THE PHONE -- a diagram. "How to pick a lock."42.Charlie steels his nerves. At Jerry's back door, he clumsily
          tries to pick the lock. After a moment or two, he realizes
          he has no idea what he's doing.CHARLIE (CONT'D)Crap.
          He walks away from the door, frustrated. Then turns and
          impulsively tries to KICK IN the DOOR with his foot. Nothing
          happens.
          Then something occurs to Charlie. He goes into the garden.CHARLIE (CONT'D)The Perrys...
          Charlie finds a FAKE ROCK. Turns it over. It has a KEY in
          it. Charlie's like -- duh.
          He puts the key in the back door lock. It opens.INT. JERRY'S HOUSE - NIGHTCharlie moves through the first story of the house. He's
          cautious, on edge.
          At first the place seems totally unremarkable. A typical
          "guy pad". Lots of inexpensive furniture, bad art, a salt
          water fish tank...
          At every turn, Charlie expects something or someone to jump
          out at him. It's unbearably tense.INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- UPSTAIRS -- NIGHTCharlie looks upstairs. Moves through a plain white hallway,
          finds an open door that leads to Jerry's office, where he
          keeps an EXTENSIVE LIBRARY.
          On one wall hangs a TAPESTRY that looks very old, decorated
          with a strange INSIGNIA. Charlie takes a picture of it with
          his phone.INT. JERRY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHTCharlie goes into Jerry's bedroom - opens his closet. Sees a
          variety of UNIFORMS. Cop, gas man, UPS, etc. Charlie
          reacts, chilled.
          Charlie stops. JERRY'S TRUCK is pulling into the driveway.
          Charlie's in a panic. Jerry will be inside any moment.43.There's no time to get out so Charlie ducks into the CLOSET.INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- CLOSET -- NIGHTCharlie pushes as far back into the closet as he can go.
          Leans against the back wall.
          The BACK OF THE CLOSET SWINGS OPEN and Charlie falls back
          into a HIDDEN HALLWAY.
          Charlie stands, stunned, see that the hallway is lined by
          small rooms on either side.
          It's clear that these are additions Jerry's added. Each room
          has a small rectangular WINDOW, so you can see in.
          Charlie reacts, sick. It looks like a prison. Despite the
          danger, he creeps over and looks in one of the rooms--WHAM!!A pale HAND slaps against the window. Charlie jumps.CHARLIEFuck! --
          DORIS is in the window now. Bruised and so pale she looks
          almost BLUE.DORISHelp...CHARLIEOh my God. Oh, shit--
          Charlie tugs on the door. Locked.
          He stands back, what to do? Charlie hears a NOISE. The
          FRONT DOOR. And then -- JERRY'S FOOTSTEPS approaching.DORISOh... Oh no... Get me out of here!
          Doris pounds on the door. In a cold panic.CHARLIEI'm -- I won't leave you--
          But Charlie has no choice. The footsteps are getting CLOSER.DORISPlease! No! Don't go!44.Charlie ducks inside one of the CELLS across from Doris,
          moves behind the door.
          JERRY steps into the hallway, walks right by Charlie's hiding
          place. Pauses near him.
          The door is ajar. Was it that way before? Charlie holds his
          breath.
          Jerry moves to the CELL and retrieves DORIS's half-alive body
          from it.
          Charlie cautiously looks through the crack in the door.DORIS (CONT'D).no... . God, no... please...
          The door to Doris's cell open. Charlie can see PART of
          Doris's body and face.
          Jerry is mostly obscured, bent over Doris -- holding her.
          Charlie watches helplessly, horrified.DORIS (CONT'D)Please, please... don't kill me.
          Doris's body TENSES and starts to jerk, as Jerry TUGS AND
          RIPS AT IT SAVAGELY. It's clear he's FEEDING ON HER,
          although we can't see his face.
          Doris screams, then starts to cry. It's stark and REAL and
          terrifying.
          It seems to go on and on. Doris weakens, her head lolling to
          one side, her light fading.
          A small stream of blood spreads across the white pavement.
          In the position she's in, she is eye to eye with CHARLIE.
          She sees him, smiles weakly. Then mouths something -- too
          weak to make much sound.DORIS (CONT'D)Cha... Cha...
          CHARLIE is petrified. Doris gets it -- smiles a little
          grimly, puts a finger to her lips. Silence.
          After what seems like an eternity, Jerry is satisfied. He
          tosses Doris aside and stands away from her.
          Charlie DUCKS behind the door as Jerry emerges and casually
          wipes a spot of blood from his mouth.45.Then Jerry LOCKS DORIS back into her cell. Pockets the key
          and moves off toward the stairs. After a moment, he's gone.
          The sound of a TV starts in Jerry's living room. Something
          banal like "The Real Housewives of Orange County."
          Charlie knows this is his moment. With shaking hands, he
          retrieves his iPhone and pulls up the "HOW TO PICK A LOCK"
          screen.
          Charlie looks through the window in Doris's cell. She's
          breathing -- alive.
          Charlie whispers to himself as he uses a bobby pin and a tiny
          screwdriver on the lock.CHARLIEPlease... Please...
          The bobby pin slips. Drops. Charlie's losing it. Steadies
          himself. Tries again.CHARLIE (CONT'D)Come on.
          The tension is unbearable. Charlie can hear JERRY moving
          downstairs.CLICKThe lock slides open. Charlie breathes with relief. Then he
          grabs Doris and BOLTS.
          Charlie SLIPS in a pool of blood left behind from Jerry's
          feeding, but he manages to stay on his feet.
          He pushes Doris ahead of him, to a BACK STAIRCASE.
          His PHONE drops out of his pocket, he has to double back --
          every moment counts. Doris's barely aware of what's
          happening, let alone where she is.INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- STAIRWELL/ENTRY -- DAWNA moment later. Charlie and Doris emerge downstairs, near
          the entry hall. They can see the front door -- and hear
          Jerry moving in another room.
          Charlie looks around, trying to get oriented.
          JERRY emerges -- almost sees them. Charlie ducks into a
          hiding spot and grabs Doris, covering her mouth.46.A long beat as Jerry returns to the living room with a beer.
          Settles in a chair facing away from the door.
          Charlie considers his options. Says almost silently:CHARLIESame floor plan.
          He grabs Doris and bolts for the kitchen.INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- DAWNA back door. Leading out. Charlie and Doris race for it,

          Doris looks up at him, her EYES TURNING BLACK, her veins
          going gray. A first ray of pure sunlight hits them.CHARLIEDoris?
          In a flash, DORIS starts to BURN. Charlie is helpless to stop

          Jane moves to the windows, throws the curtains open. Charlie

          Charlie leads Amy through the throngs of people -- the
          different levels of the club are like a maze. Glass
          staircases lead to mirrored balconies...
          A hopped-up DJ climbs up on a balcony, starts throwing t-
          shirts into the crowd.DJTequila Man t-shirts! Yeeeeeahhhh!
          The crowd goes nuts, SURGES forward...
          Someone bumps Amy and Charlie and they lose hands.AMYCharlie!
          Charlie turns, a DRUNK CHICK gets in his way -- tries to
          dance with him. He pushes past her.88.CHARLIEAmy? Amy!
          Charlie can't see Amy, instead sees HIMSELF over and over
          again in a series of mirrors -- the infinity effect.
          It's dizzying, disorienting.
          THEN HE SEES JERRY, a shark, moving in and out of the crowd,
          disappearing behind mirrored columns, reemerging...
          Charlie also sees that JERRY DOESN'T REFLECT in the mirrors
          around them. Instead the crowd parts as if by magic.
          Jerry's heading straight toward--AMYwho's been pushed toward the DJ stand by the crowd. She's
          spinning, looking desperately for Charlie.CHARLIE (CONT'D)Amy!
          Charlie's frantically pushing toward her. But the CRUSH of
          people makes it nearly impossible to gain ground.CLOSE ON AMYAs a HAND slips into hers. She turns, relieved, to find--JERRYHolding her with a firm grip.AMYNo. No!
          Amy STRUGGLES and CRIES OUT as JERRY PULLS HER away from
          CHARLIE, toward ramp that leads to another dance floor.
          Jerry laughs, throws her over his shoulder.AMY (CONT'D)Help!!
          A GUY in the crowd high-fives him. All part of another crazy
          night in Vegas.GUYGo get her, man!
          AMY sees her fast-moving reflection in the mirror -- she
          appears to be FLOATING above the people.89.AMYHelp me! Help!!
          CHARLIE can SEE HER, but can't get to her. The crowd is
          indifferent to her cries.
          Charlie grabs his cell -- hits a button. It dials, then--CHARLIE(INTO PHONE)Peter! We're in the casino, the
          club! Jerry's got Amy! He's gotHER--INT. PETER'S PANIC ROOM -- NIGHTPeter's holding his cell. It's ringing.

          tries to run, but he holds her tight.AMYCharlie's coming, he'll find me--JERRYI'm counting on it.
          Amy SPITS on him. Jerry reacts -- a flash of RAGE and he
          exposes his brutal rows of TEETH for just an instant.JERRY (CONT'D)Come on.
          He grips her harder, sways with her to the music. Leans
          close to her ear, seductive.
          His predatory skills in high gear.JERRY (CONT'D)You just need a taste. You'll see.
          It can be like a dream.
          Jerry draws a nail over his wrist, draws a line of blood. He
          puts his mouth over the cut, bloodying it.
          He forces her into a DEEP KISS. She struggles mightily --
          but then her body relaxes, as if she's been sedated.90.JERRY (CONT'D)That's it... Good girl.
          JERRY looks up sees CHARLIE coming toward them.
          But Amy's altered now. Staring into Jerry's eyes like a
          child.
          CHARLIE'S GETTING CLOSER when--CHARLIEAmy! No!--
          BAM! A hand falls on his shoulder.A DOORMANDOORMANHow'd you get in here?CHARLIEYou have to help me. That guy,
          he's going to kill her, he's aKILLER--The doorman glances at JERRY and AMY. Jerry stokes Charlie's
          anguish -- running his hands over Amy's ass, kissing her
          neck.DOORMANYeah? Then she's liking it.
          Charlie's beside himself, enraged and terrorized.CHARLIEYou don't understand!--DOORMANID. Then you can tell me your
          whole sad story--CHARLIENo! There's no time-- Amy!!
          Charlie's increasingly desperate, tries to RUN. But the
          doorman has a good grip, pulls him back.JERRYSees that CHARLIE is restrained.
          Jerry locks eyes with Charlie and SMILES, his horrible fangs
          exposed. He's taking Charlie's woman -- and enjoying it.91.CHARLIE (CONT'D)No! NO!CHARLIE'S POVAs he's being dragged away -- JERRY BRUTALLY BITES AMY.
          It's a nightmare.

          Peter turns. Sees Charlie standing in the doorway.PETERHow'd you get in here?CHARLIESecurity's a little lax. Everybody
          got their throat ripped out.
          Peter backs away as Charlie moves in.
          Charlie is different. Colder, harder. Like he's aged a
          decade in one night.PETERYou too? He change you?CHARLIELook at your monitor.

          There's no fighting. There's only
          surviving, if you're lucky--CHARLIEYou call this surviving? If you
          live and we all die, you think
          you'll ever be able to get us out
          of your head?PETERI know I won't. I never could --
          not after the first time.
          This stops Charlie.PETER (CONT'D)I told myself I probably made it
          up. I was a kid. Maybe it was
          easier to believe in monsters...CHARLIEMade what up?PETERThe vampire who killed my parents,
          my brothers. But not me. I hid.
          Charlie reacts. Surprised, but now it all makes sense.
          Peter continues, haunted--PETER (CONT'D)I didn't collect all this stuff for
          fun. I thought maybe I could find
          the tribe, "avenge" my people.CHARLIESo do it. We'll go in at dawn.
          He's got to rest sometime--PETER(HARD)It's not like that. When I was a
          kid, I hid because I wanted to
          live. I still do! This isn't the

          Moment of hesitation for Charlie. Has he been affected by

          tomorrow, not if you're the kind of
          man I have to be.
          A moment. Peter is full of self-loathing, but resolved.
          Charlie turns to leave.PETERWait.
          Peter takes something from his luggage. A stake carved from
          WHITE WOOD. He hands it to Charlie.PETER (CONT'D)Blessed by Saint Michael. Kill a
          vampire with it -- it's supposed to

          changed, you can still save her.CHARLIE(RE: STAKE)If it's for real.PETERWho knows what's for real any more.
          Charlie takes the stake. Starts to go. Peter stops him--PETER (CONT'D)There's no guarantee he'll be
          asleep during the day. He's
          housebound, not hibernating.CHARLIEI'll figure it out.PETERNo, you need a plan. To stake him,
          you have to get close -- he's
          stronger than you.CHARLIEHoly water?94PETERSlow him down. Won't stop him.(THEN)Torch him, you'll have a few good
          minutes before he really goes up.
          Believe me, a vampire on fire isn't
          thinking clearly.CHARLIEBut if he's on fire, how do I get
          close enough to stake him?
          A beat.PETERFuck.CHARLIE(POINTED)You just worry about yourself.
          With that, Charlie leaves.
          Off PETER. Disgusted with himself.INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT/DAYCharlie sits by Jane's bedside. She's still comatose.
          We move closer and see that Charlie's drawing a MAP OF
          JERRY'S HOUSE on some scrap paper -- laying it out from
          memory as best he can.
          He GLANCES at the clock as it ticks toward DA
          As Charlie plots, he talks to Jane -- his silent confidante.CHARLIE (CONT'D)Those rooms upstairs, that's

          He thinks... Then looks up, an idea occurring. Jane lies
          there peacefully.CHARLIE (CONT'D)I have to go.
          More energized, Charlie stands and gathers his things.

          takes this in. Finally, Charlie's like -- fuck it.CHARLIE (CONT'D)Going to kill a vampire.

          CHARLIE stands on the front lawn, contemplating the houses.
          He wears fireproof clothes, has stakes and crosses strapped
          to him, holsters made out of duct-tape...
          Slung over his shoulder is the spray canister. And he holds
          a crowbar in a free hand. He looks like something out of one
          of Ed's graphic novels.

          not sure what he'll see when he gets a better look at her.CHARLIEAMY--Amy slowwwwly gets up, turns...

          almost FALLS through an open floor in an unfinished portion
          of the house.
          Jerry's building more cells.
          Charlie backs out of the doorway, turns a corner and BAM!
          He runs into JERRY. No, wait -- it's PETER.
          He's not wearing his wig, etc. But he's cleaned up and
          standing tall. Dressed all in black.CHARLIEShit! You--PETER CHARLIESorry-- How'd you--
          A beat. Then:PETERGuess I don't want to be a man like

          And a flask. Peter grins.PETER (CONT'D)Let's kill something.98.CHARLIE(RE: FLASK)You reek. Midori?PETERDon't get greedy. I'm here.(THEN/PROUD)And I found something else. From

          They look around -- eyes adjusting. There's barely any
          light.
          They're in a LARGE UNFINISHED BASEMENT. The floor is dirt
          and the main story of the house is held up by numerousSUPPORT POSTS.At the far end of the basement there is a door that leads to
          another room/storage area.ON CHARLIEAs he sees something. Stops.
          A MOUND of dirt. Like a grave.
          Charlie indicates to Peter to follow him. They whisper:CHARLIEYou uncover him. I'll light him
          up, then stake him.
          Charlie pulls a FABRIC MASK, like a ski mask, over his face.
          Peter looks at him.CHARLIE (CONT'D)Flame retardant.
          They're standing over the grave now. Both nervous.
          Charlie nods to Peter. Peter does his best to hold the
          shotgun on the grave as he pushes the dirt aside with his
          free hand. He's shaking.100.After a moment Peter UNCOVERS PART OF THE BODY. Then he
          moves up toward the face...

          As the face emerges, Charlie readies a match, then reaches
          for his STAKE--PETER (CONT'D)Stop! No--
          CHARLIE stops JUST AS HE'S ABOUT TO TOSS the match.PETER (CONT'D)Who is that?

          least. Charlie turns. Sees the graves.PETER (CONT'D)You know them too?
          Charlie reacts, stunned.
          Peter moves to another grave, uncovers another sleeping face.

          coming from behind the door to the other room. A beat.
          They're both petrified as they move toward the door.
          Peter readies the gun again. Charlie pulls a CROSS out along

          Charlie gets his first look at AMY in full VAMPIRE glory.
          She's even more freaky looking than Jerry or Ed. Her face is
          nearly overtaken by a wide mouth filled with razor-sharp
          teeth. Her eyes are crazed and blood-red.
          It's gruesome and terrifying.
          Charlie sees THE STAKE at the lip of the hole. Dives for it.

          He backs away from her. Into--INT. JERRY'S BASEMENT -- DAYThe basement where Jerry and the THE TRIBE are CIRCLED around
          a body as MS. GRANADA feeds.
          ON PETER, who's pale and shaking...
          Charlie attacks them with THE CROWBAR.CHARLIEGet off him!
          He hits MS. GRANADA off Peter. Manages to hold off JERRY for
          a beat. Spins and HITS ADAM in the head.ADAMDude!CHARLIESorry.
          AMY enters from the other room -- already healing. Jerry
          sees her -- holds up a hand and backs the others off.JERRYI'll finish this.
          Jerry, all swagger, moves in on Charlie.
          Charlie sees Peter, barely alive, spit out his FAKE VAMP
          teeth. Peter meets his gaze, wry and weak. Done for.PETERWorth a shot. "Master of
          illusion."
          Now Charlie notices SHOTGUN not far from Peter's body. He
          dives for it, but Jerry steps on it -- kicks it away.JERRY(TO CHARLIE)You think that's going to stop me?
          Time to man up.
          Jerry brutally kicks Charlie, sends him sprawling.106.JERRY (CONT'D)Now. I'm going to kill your girl --
          make you watch. I'll take my time
          with you. And once you're dead,
          I'll finish your mother.(RE: AMY)Too bad about that one. She sucked
          me dry. Like a pro.
          Amy smiles a little. Jerry GRABS CHARLIE, lifts him off hisFEET--Charlie, enraged, SPRAYS JERRY WITH GAS FROM the CANISTER --
          right in the eyes.
          Jerry recoils, HISSING. Adam and the OTHER VAMPS MOVE IN.
          Jerry's over it. He's on CHARLIE in a flash, FANGS BARED.
          About to RIP HIS NECK OUT.BLAM!PETER has the gun again -- has managed to pull himself up
          into a sitting position.
          He BLOWS away ONE OF THE SUPPORT BEAMS.

          BLAM! And ANOTHER.
          BLAM -- he misses.PETERFuck.BLAM! AND ANOTHER.Charlie DIVES for SAFETY as the CEILING COLLAPSES in part of

          the other vamps into a corner.PETER (CONT'D)(TO JERRY)Fuck yeah! Nice sweater, loser!BLAM!Another BEAM collapses. BURYING JERRY, AMY and the others
          under DEBRIS from the floor above.
          A stunned beat.
          Peter slumps, exhausted from the effort.107.Charlie looks at him -- amazed.PETER (CONT'D)(WEAK)I'm better with stationary targets.CHARLIEYeah you are.
          Peter looks at him, sad.PETERGet out of here. We don't have
          much time before they dig out.CHARLIE(RE: STAKE)I can save you. I have to kill him
          with this.PETERYou're a brave mother, I get it.
          And you were right. This is how I
          had to go... But we didn't count
          on an army.CHARLIEHe'll kill you both, he said--PETERWe're already dead.(THEN)Go now, you live to fight another
          day. Stay -- there won't be one.
          Charlie stops. Swayed. Pained.PETER (CONT'D)Do it.CLOSE ON CHARLIEAccepting it. It's what he has to do.
          He starts DIGGING.PETER (CONT'D)Charlie!
          But Charlie ignores him, determined. Pulls his MASK DOWN
          over his face again.PETER (CONT'D)Stop!108.WHAM! JERRY BURSTS OUT OF THE RUBBLE, attacks Charlie.
          Charlie falls back, PULLING JERRY with him into THE LIGHT
          Jerry BURSTS INTO FLAME -- but holds Charlie tight
          AMY and the other vamps start to claw their way OUT of the
          rubble.
          Charlie and Jerry fight -- nearly ENGULFED IN FLAMES nowPETER (CONT'D)Charlie!
          Peter gets up, painfully, moves to help.
          Raging and desperate -- Charlie and Jerry continue to battle.
          Finally, Jerry pulls Charlie down with him --rolls on the
          ground as they fight. Trying to put out the flames.
          Jerry starts to DISINTEGRATE -- he's about to EXPLODE into
          bits. Charlie's stake is now ON FIRE.CHARLIENO!A last desperate attempt. He can see Jerry's HEART, about to
          burn away.HE STAKES JERRY.AMY suddenly SCREAMS - she's burning inside, DYING. Or so it
          seems. The vampire is being burned out of her.
          PETER cries out too, reacting less violently. But in pain.JERRYStill burning, looks down as the STAKE OF SAINT MICHAEL in
          his CHEST. Right through the heart.
          He starts to SHAKE VIOLENTLY -- faster and faster, just like
          Ed did -- becoming little more than a macabre BLUR.
          For a moment -- Jerry's human form hangs in the air...JERRYBlow me.THEN HE BLOWS INTO A MILLION PIECES.ON CHARLIE AND PETER109.Thinking fast, PETER tackles CHARLIE -- who is still in
          flames. They tumble into one of the open graves.

          edge of the open grave.ABOVE THE OPEN GRAVEPeter pulls Charlie's mask back. Charlie is burned,

          She crawls into the grave. Cradles Charlie in her arms.AMY (CONT'D)Charlie...
          Amy starts to cry. Peter looks on, concerned. Finally,
          Charlie opens his eyes. Says weakly...CHARLIEBlow me? Seriously?
          Peter falls back -- exhausted. Laughing.CHARLIE (CONT'D)Those are his last words? What a
          tool.
          We pull away, leaving this tableau...
          UNTIL ADAM, MS. GRANADA and the OTHER MEMBERS of the tribe
          emerge from the rubble. Disoriented, freaked.

          She has a glass of wine -- he's drinking a COKE.JANEThink you'll ever feel the same

          killed your first vampire...CHARLIEI am so going to perform.
          Charlie KISSES her. It's intense, passionate. It's
          different, they're different. The childish part of them long
          gone.
          He runs his hands through her hair, pulls her close.

          Charlie follows PETER into the DINING ROOM, where a BAR CART
          is set up. Peter moves to it. Pours himself a Midori.CHARLIE (CONT'D)I thought you were on the wagon.PETERIt's dark.

          to look out for her.PETERYeah you do. So here's what I'm
          thinking. We faced the beast and

          saving people from evil? WhatABOUT--A CHILLING LAUGH interrupts them. Distant. Eerie. And

          twisted in a grimace of fear and pain... It's CHILLING.
          Charlie's spooked. But he looks again and the face is gone.CHARLIE (CONT'D)Yeah, definitely get new stuff.113.Peter leads CHARLIE OUT, back to the ladies in the other
          room. Still on about his idea...WE HOLD ON THEIR REFLECTION IN THE WINDOWPETER (O.S.)I'm serious, man. Do you know how
