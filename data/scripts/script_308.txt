          moon to the sun. Bright. Beautiful. The sun DISSOLVESTO:Cave paintings of a family of cavemen -- we will come to
          know them as The Croods.EEP (V.O.)With every sun comes a new day. A new
           beginning. A hope that things will be
           better today than they were yesterday.
                         
          The Croods scurry out of their cave like mice looking for
          food. Scared. Fast.
                         
          The Croods are chased by beasts across the desert. They
          escape from creatures up trees. They hide behind rocks.EEP (V.O.)But not for me. My name's Eep. This, is
           my family, the Croods. If you weren't
           clued in already by the animal skins and
           sloping foreheads - we're cavemen. Most
           days we spend in our cave, in the dark.
           Night after night, day after day. Yep.
           Home sweet home. When we did go out, we
           struggled to find food in a harsh and
           hostile world. And I struggled to
           survive my family.
                         
          The Croods are chased by beasts across the desert. They
          escape from creatures up trees. They hide behind rocks.EEP (V.O.)We were the last ones around. There used
           to be neighbors. The Gorts, smashed by a
           mammoth. The Horks, swallowed by a sand
           snake. The Erfs, mosquito bite. Throgs,
           common cold. And, the Croods. That's
           us. The Croods made it...
                         
          Grug protects his family from a GIANT BEAR OWL.EEP (V.O.)Because of my Dad. He was strong... and
           he followed the rules.
                         
          A shadow falls across their feet and Grug ushers his
          family home.2.EEP (V.O.)... the ones painted on the cave walls.
           Anything new is bad, curiosity is bad,
           going out at night is bad. Basically,
           anything fun is bad. Welcome to my
           world.
                         
          They all run back into the cave where Grug slams the rock
          door closed.
                         
          SLOWLY LIGHT ON CAVE PAINTINGS COMES UP AGAIN. But this
          time the light casts an ominous tone.EEP (V.O.)But this is a story about how all that
           changed in an instant.RAPID SHOTS OF THE GREAT SPLIT CUTTING THROUGH THE LAND.HEADED TOWARDS CROOD VALLEY.SHOTS OF CATACLYSM. CUT FASTER AND FASTER UNTIL...EEP (V.O.)Because what we didn't know, was that our
           world was about to come to an end. And
           there were no rules on our cave walls to
           prepare us for that.
                         
          CAVEMAN HANDS PRESS against the rock wall. They PUSH. A
          BLINDING LIGHT FLOODS the screen.CUT TO:SEQ. 100 - MEET THE CROODSA HUGE CAVEMAN, GRUG, RUSHES forward, screaming,
          growling, and throwing handfuls of dirt in a THREAT
          DISPLAY. He BLINKS in the bright morning light. He
          LIFTS and HURLS a large boulder.GRUGRaaaaar grooooOOOOoooowwwll ERF ERF
           Glaaaaaabbbbllllllllthhhh!
                         
          As suddenly as he began, Grug stops. Panting, he waits
          for the echoes of his outburst to fade.
                         
          Grug TURNS to the cave entrance, he prepares to BELLOW a
          signal, but before any sound escapes his lips--
                         
          A CAVE GIRL, EEP, bursts from the cave.3.GRUG (CONT'D)You're supposed to wait for my signal
           Eep. Eep?
                         
          Eep scares a pack of nearby Liyotes away. They pounce on
          Grug briefly before scampering off. Eep spreads out on
          an overhanging rock. She BASKS IN THE SUN.EEPWe've been in that cave forever.GRUGThree days is not forever.EEPIt is with this family.GRUGEep would you come down here? You're
           being so dramatic.
                         
          A LITTLE GIRL, SANDY, charges out next. Her display is
          more terrier-like.GRUG (CONT'D)No, no, no Sandy, come back here.
           Remember the signal. Good girls wait for
           the signal.
                         
          A CAVE WOMAN, UGGA, scrambles out next. She is mostly
          focused on catching Sandy, giving only cursory effort to
          her display.GRUG (CONT'D)Ugga.UGGAAs soon as I get Sandy, I'll go back in,
           and you can give the signal.GRUGNo, I mean, you're already out now.THUNK (O.S.)I am waiting for the signal, dad.
                         
          We HEAR the voice of Grug's nine-year-old son from inside
          the cave. THUNK is eager to please his dad and emulates
          his every move.GRUGNever mind, Thunk. Just, come out.4.THUNK(not so fast)
           Uhh, but if you don't give the signal,
           how do I know you're my dad?GRUGThe signal isn't so you know it's me,
           it's so you know I wasn't eaten by an
           animal.
                         
          Beat.THUNKThen why is the signal an animal noise?
           I mean, doesn't that just confuse things?
                         
          Grug sighs.THUNK (CONT'D)I don't know... I'm still waiting for the
           signal.GRUGSigh. Hoo hooooo! Hoo hooooo!
                         
          Thunk comes out growling, and barrels into Grug. Thunk
          picks up a boulder and throws it. It ricochets off the
          cliff wall and careens into Grug. Grug gets plowed over
          by the boulder.UGGAMom, we're ready to leave.(BEAT)Mom!
                         
          Grug sits up and smiles.GRANStill alive!
                         
          Grug's face drops.GRUGIt's still early.GRANAnd you're still fat.GRUGBreakfast formation!
                         
          The Croods form up in a flying wedge, with Grug in the
          lead.5.GRUG (CONT'D)I want to see some real caveman action
           out there. We do this fast. We do this
           loud, we do this as a family and never
           not be afraid. Go!THUNKYAY, BREAKFAST!!!!COMPRESSED TIME - The Croods RUN out of Crood canyon,

          GROUNDS. They are spent from a fifteen-mile run.THUNK(HUFFING)Yeah... breakfast...
                         
          We see a nest with a huge unguarded blue egg. The Croods
          take shelter behind a rock. Grug PEERS over the top.GRUGWho's up?
                         
          Eep's hand SHOOTS up. Thunk is less than enthusiastic.GRUG (CONT'D)We'll flip for it.
                         
          Grug LIFTS Gran on his hand, and FLIPS her up in the air.GRUG (CONT'D)Call her in the air.EEPHeads.

          tail is showing.GRUGTails. Thunk's in.GRUG (CONT'D)Positions.6.The family fades back and splits up. They get into
          fighting/running position.GRUG (CONT'D)Ok. Thunk. Go. Come on Thunk.
                         
          Thunk BREAKS COVER. He dashes into the open, SNATCHES
          the egg.GRUG (CONT'D)Hah! Way to go. Take it to the cave!
                         
          Thunk PASSES Grug and makes a bee-line for Crood Canyon.
                         
          A Gerf bird smashes Thunk and steals the egg back.GRUG (CONT'D)Oooh!GRUG (CONT'D)Release the baby.
                         
          Eep and Sandy MOVE IN on the bird. Sandy NIPS at its
          heels while UGGA CLIMBS up onto its head. She PULLS the
          egg from its beak.
                         
          Down range, TRIP GERBILS SURFACE. They STRETCH their
          shared tail across the Ramu's path like an arresting
          cable on a carrier.
                         
          Ugga RISES to THROW the egg to Grug - the gerbils WRAP
          their tail around the Ramu like a bola. The Ramu GOES
          DOWN hard. Ugga and the egg ROLL forward. The Trip
          Gerbils SNATCH up the egg and make off with it.UGGAGet um Mom! Do it for the Croods!
                         
          Gran's cane HOOKS the gerbils in the middle of their tail
          and WHIPS them up and over her shoulder.ON GRANDRIBBLING the egg down-range with her cane like a hockey
          player. LIYOTES POP UP from behind hoodoos. They SWARM
          in behind her.
                         
          The Liyotes TRIP Gran. They steal the egg, and HIT THE
          GAS. They are INCREDIBLY FAST.GRANOld lady down! Eep, avenge me.7.ON EEPCrouched in the shade of a scrubby bush, like a runner on
          the blocks - she has the Liyotes in her sights. EepLAUNCHES.Eep runs after the Liyote with the egg, cutting him off
          in his tracks he slams into a cactus launching the egg
          into the air. Eep leaps into the air taking back the egg.EEPThanks!
                         
          A bunch of Jackrobats see Eep and swarm around her. She
          loses her footing and throws the egg to Grug.GRUGEep!EEPHeads Up!
                         
          Grug catches the egg and runs by the entrance of a small
          cave. Thunk following close behind accidentally trips
          over the tail of a sleeping Bear Owl knocking Grug to the
          ground and fumbling the egg once again.
                         
          Thunk catches the egg just as the Girelephant bears down
          on him from behind and lifts him onto one of its tusks.
          The family members meet up as they begin their long run
          back to the cave.
                         
          An entire swarm of animals chase the Croods as they head
          back to their cave.
                         
          The Bear Owl is awakened and goes after everyone on the
          chase.
                         
          Grug protecting his family from the BearOwl tosses each
          family member onto the Girelephant's back.
                         
          Grug dodges the BearOwl's attack and uses him as a
          launching pad to get himself safely on the Girelephant.
                         
          Thunk is happy to see Dad is safe.THUNKOh hey Dad, can we eat now?GRUGJust wait till we get home. Eep put on
           the brakes.
                         
          The entrance to Crood canyon appears on the horizon.8.Eep hangs off the edge of one of its tusks as Grug takes
          over the other. Together they dig their heels into the
          ground, slowing down the Girelephant.
                         
          The Bearowl continues the chase. The Croods maneuver the
          Girelephant to fend off the Bearowl.GRUG (CONT'D)Eep!
                         
          The Girelephant moving way too fast readies for the
          crash. The Girelephant crashes into the entrance of the
          canyon, sending the Croods flying in. They all tumble.
          Grug makes an extraordinary football catch. He holds
          tight to the meal as he slams into a rock. Grug holds up
          the egg.GRUG (CONT'D)Who's hungry?THUNKAlright! Good one, dad!GRUGHere you go, Thunk. Drink up.
                         
          Grug tosses the egg to Thunk, Thunk fumbles it and it
          cracks open.THUNKSorry, dad.UGGALooks like fast food tonight!
                         
          The family passes the leaky egg around quickly, each
          Crood gets a taste. Thunk is the last Crood to get a
          mouthful, he hands it over to Grug-- the egg is empty.GRUGThat's alright. I ate last week.
                         
          A SHADOW TOUCHES Grug's feet. He looks up - the sun is
          setting behind the canyon wall. He HOLDS UP his hand to
          gauge how much daylight is left.GRANTwo knuckle warning.UGGACome on Croods. Go, go, go.CUT TO:9.SEQ. 200 - WELCOME TO CROOD CAVEINT. CROOD CAVE - EVENINGGRUGCome on, come on. Darkness brings death!

          The Croods RUN INSIDE THE CAVE. Ugga picks up a heavy
          stick off the floor.UGGAThe moon is full. Bath night.

          Grug is finished with his bath.GRUG (CONT'D)(LOSING PATIENCE)Eep! Eep?
                         
          Eep begins to climb down the wall outside when she hears
          a sound in the distance. Curious, she begins to climb
          even higher. Grug leaves the cave, searching for her.GRUG (CONT'D)Come on, I gotta close the cave...
                         
          ON GRUG exiting the cave... Grug sees that Eep is at the
          very top.GRUG (CONT'D)Eep!

          Behind Grug, the Bear Owl appears up the canyon. It
          SPOTS Grug and the open cave and RACES to attack. Grug
          sees the BearOwl in full attack mode.GRUG (CONT'D)EEP! COME DOWN!!Grug throws a rock which momentarily stuns the creature,
          allowing Eep to JUMP DOWN and DART into the cave. Grug
          barely gets the cave closed in time.11.GRUG (CONT'D)SIGHCUT TO:SEQ. 210 - BEDTIME STORYThe Bear Owl PUSHES his paw through the narrow opening,
          and FEELS around for the Croods. The Croods are like

          A pebble hits Grug in the head. It came from Eep's
          ledge.GRUG (CONT'D)Hey!UGGASee? She's listening.13.GRUGIf she wants to survive, she has to
           follow our rules.UGGAHow about a story? Eep loves those.

           huh?THUNKOh yeah, tell us a story.
                         
          The Croods minus Eep gather in a semi-circle on the
          ground. Grug retrieves Sandy and her Krispy Bear from
          the bone-crib.GRUGOk. Can I borrow that? Thank you. Eep!
           Your old favorite?EEPI haven't played with that thing in

           Bear.
                         
          Grug sits and waits a beat for Eep to join, but she stays
          put.
          As Grug talks, he gestures at a rough sketch on the wall
          of the cave.GRUG (CONT'D)A long time ago, this little bear was
           alive. She was alive because she
           listened to her father and lived her life

          catch it in her hands.
                         
          Eep presses her face against the cold boulder, trying to

          Desperate to see more, Eep braces her back against the
          cave and PUSHES the plug rock with her legs. Slowly, she
          shifts the rock, careful not to wake her father. It takes
          all of her strength, but she manages to move it just
          enough for her to BARELY SQUEEZE out.EXT. CROOD CANYON - CONTINUOUSEep stands outside at night for the first time ever. Her

          from her. The wind has changed direction. The breeze at

          the creature. She THROWS and FLIPS it over her shoulder.

          The Macawnivore rushes into a giant rib cage that Grug
          has coated with tar. The Piranha Owls hit the rib cage
          and stick to it. As they fight to free themselves, the
          rib cage lifts off the ground. Grug takes a giant tree
