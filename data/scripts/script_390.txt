          others more like the explanatory arrows found in cartoons.
          Sometimes the words present themselves in normal fashion. At
          other times, they're loosely spaced or sharply angled or
          individual words flash up one after another. i.e., titles

          joking with GINNY (28, knocked around but still spirited; two
          kids at home from different guys; she somehow maintains a good
          attitude). Slim views Ginny as her idol: for her attitude, not
          her life. Catch them in mid-conversation, Ginny slightly
          offended, working-class accent:GINNYWhy not? My grandfather was a

          moving for two hours, but now they can take a breath, survey
          the scene. Slim notices Ginny has a wet spot under her arm.SLIMEver try the rock, hey?GINNYExcuse me?SLIMThe deodorant thing. It's salts or

          Slim gives her a look, grabs a menu, goes over to where the new
          customer, whom we will call for the moment OUR HERO, is seated.4When she reaches his booth, she notices he's got a book and a
          long-stemmed red rose. She hands him a menu -SLIMWaiting for somebody?

          your looks.SLIM(NODS SOBERLY)That is bad news, 'cause my
          personality bites.
          Ginny grins. Slim writes up a check for a CUSTOMER at the
          counter. When she finishes, the turkey burger is up.
          She carries it to the table:SLIMTB, coleslaw, and so forth. You
          don't really write books, do you?OUR HERONope.SLIMI don't read Finnecan's Wake either.7OUR HEROI'm goin' into law. Enforcement.
          She nods. This is more like what she expected.SLIMWho's the rose for?
          He shrugs.
          She's busy, so she starts to go:SLIMEnjoy your grub, huh?
          She's seven feet away when she hears:OUR HEROHEY -Sheturns back toward him -
          He smiles, offers the rose:OUR HEROYou.
          She smiles back-their eyes meet... a sudden utterly magical
          moment. This is also the moment to.note OUR HERO should be
          played by a famous actor doing a cameo. Because at this
          instant the scene changes.
          The man (MITCH) in the booth behind Our Hero - a man we haven't
          noticed because all we've seen is the back of his head - turns
          and looks at Slim. Stands. Looks down at Our Hero...MITCHHow much did you settle on?OUR HEROExcuse. me?
          Slim frowns, steps closer so she can overhear:MITCHThe bet. How much is it?
          Our Hero has a completely blank look on his face -MITCH (CONT.)You and your friend. Yesterday.
          Was it 200 or 500 or - ?8SLIM(TO MITCH)What're you -MITCHHe bet his friend he could get in
          your pants in less than twelve
          hours, starting noon today.
          Our Hero rises to his feet and pushes Mitch in the chest, which
          looks like a stupid move, since Mitch is bigger -OUR HEROIs this your business?
          (right in Mitch's face)
          What are you, the morals police?
          He pushes again and Mitch,s hand shoots out like a snake
          striking. Grabs him by the collar. Lifts him. A frozen
          moment, more violence just a breath away, and a sense of things
          about to spin out of control... Our Hero's eyes are popping;
          he tries to hide his fear:OUR HEROTake it easy, M...man. She and
          I were just having some fun -SLIM(to our Hero)
          Was it two hundred or five?(VERY CALM)I want to know what I'm worth.
          Our Hero gestures to Mitch: would you mind putting me down?
          Mitch reluctantly obliges.
          Our Hero does his best to recollect his dignity. Looks at
          Slim. Drops a ten on the table and smirks:OUR HEROThe bet was two, but now that I
          know you? Way too high.
          A pained look flashes across Slim's face -
          Our Hero starts toward the door, but Mitch steps in his path.
          Speaks quietly but with authority; there's a physical power in
          his words. Since he's protecting Slim, the power isCOMFORTING:MITCHDon't come back here, buddy. Ever.
          Our Hero nods nervously.
          Mitch steps back 3 inches, just far enough to let our Hero
          leave. Which he does with considerable relief.
          Slim's leaning vs. the counter, shaken, tears in her eyes -
          Mitch tugs his baseball cap, mutters as he heads for the door:MITCHSorry to get in your business.SLIMNo. Hey. Thank you.
          He nods, keeps going.SLIM (CONT.)(blurts out, grateful:)
          I... I can't believe you actually
          said something.MITCH(turns, shrugs)
          If I'd kept my mouth shut, I'd'a
          felt bad later.
          Good luck, huh?
          She nods.
          He ambles out the door. A touch of the cowboy in him.
          She shakes her head, looks at Ginny.
          Ginny gestures as if to say, well?
          At first Slim doesn't get it.
          Ginny gestures more urgently: Come on. What're you waiting
          for? She looks toward the door -
          Slim follows her look. PUSH IN ON SLIM'S FACE as she tries to
          work up the courage...
          Just as she starts toward the door, we:CUT TO:10BRIDE ANDEXT. OLD PASADENA ESTATE. NIGHT.FLASHES:Wedding photos. Mitch has lots of (surprisingly upper crust)
          family, Slim has a few friends. The more photos FLASH, the
          more pronounced (and sad), the contrast. FLY RIGHT INTO:
          Bacchanalian DANCING. French Champagne has flowed; shoes and
          inhibitions were abandoned hours ago. THE CAMERA weaves
          through the DANCERS to find:
          Slim and Mitch, dancing close, never quite touching, every move
          intense, physical, like subtle public sex. Their eyes are
          locked; she runs her veil down his body, his hand lightly
          touches her ass; they slow down and stand, lips a millimeter
          apart but not quite kissing, the sexual tension building...
          We see how crazy they are about each other, how completely
          physically involved - and how much fun they have.
          Watching them is Phil, with Mitch's parents, MRS. TYLER (58,
          confident, at ease with her power and family money, and
          likeable despite monstrous flaws) and MR. TYLER (someone Mrs.

          body of water...11PHILYou don't get along with your son?
          She gives him a look. She's both offended by, and appreciative
          of, his bluntness. Looks out at Mitch:MRS. TYLERHe's like my father. Which means, I
          guess, that he'll do very well.PHILHe's done well to get Miss Slim.MRS. TYLERYes, he has, hasn't he? He's married
          down, but he's gotten value.
           As Phil reacts, he notices his wife, SALIMA, has joined him.
          With her are two kids (5 and 2).
          Salima's looking out at the floor: not at Slim, but at Ginny
          and her dance partner. We see a thought cross her mind. She
          bends down and whispers conspiratorially to the kids.
          They whoop their response, run out to Ginny (who looks quite
          uncomfortable in her Maid-of-Honor dress).FIVE YEAR OLD SONMom! Mom! Mom! Can we spend the
          night at Phil and Salima's house?
          Ginny looks over, winks at Salima, and kisses her kids:GINNYDon't eat at their ice cream, huh?
          They squeal with pleasure and run off.
          Ginny turns back, resumes dancing with JOE (24, handsome in a
          casual way, a good guy):GINNYSo this was during college or after?JOEDuring.GINNYWhat was wrong with you?

          She pulls him into a kiss, and...well: he's not a bad kisser...
          We glide from them to Slim and Mitch, hardly moving. Suddenly:
          tender and insecure and almost comic, she looks at him...SLIMYou sure,you love me?MITCHUh-huh...13SLIMFor ever and ever?
          He stops dancing. Senses the real issue beneath her questions:MITCHYou're safe with me, Slim. You're
          safe, and it's okay to be happy.
          We deserve it.
          They kiss. Others stop to watch: how cute. Phil comes over,
          waits. When they break:PHILI'm sorry, I gotta get up five
          o'clock to buy green beans.
          He slips an envelope into Mitch's hand:PHILIn my country, it's tradition to
          give money to groom. You don't
          need it, but...
          Slim shakes her head, touched, as:MITCHThat's very sweet -SLIM(HUGGING PHIL)Thanks for giving me away, okay?
          You're the best substitute Dad a girl
          could possibly have.PHILNo substitute. I am real thing.
          She kisses him, and he goes. They look after him.MITCHHe really loves you.
          She nods, not quite picking up how odd his statement is: of
          course he loves her; she nicked him to give her away.
          Mitch turns her toward him and slips his hands inside the top
          of her dress (so the back of his hands touch her breasts; is
          this going too far?). He pulls her to him, whispers:MITCHYou gonna give me babies?14SLIMOh yeah.MITCHHow soon?SLIMHow soon can we get out of here?
          He hoists her into his arms and carries her off the floor.

          comes, etc. Mitch is building mini-malls.
          In the center of this activity, Mitch moves from one locus of
          energy to the next: answering questions, making suggestions.
          Gradually we perceive something, motion slower than the rest of
          the office. Slim. Coming toward him. He sees her. Sees her
          expression. She stops. He realizes:MITCHYou saw the doctor?

          The Nurse looks at Slim,. who nods, and gives Mitch the baby.17He kisses her head, dances with her.
          Slim looks adoringly at father and daughter: the sight is
          almost unbelievably sweet.
          His cell phone rings. He keeps dancing, ignoring it.
          After one ring, it stops.
          He's kissing the baby's head over and over, just like he kissed
          Slim, and staring into the infant's eyes -MITCHShe looks just like my baby
          pictures.
          His cell phone rings again. As if the previous call had been a

          Starts to dial-slowly, deliberately...
          Shock: RAP AT THE WINDOW! He's there.26She reacts with guilt, but he doesn't look angry now. Behind

          She shuts the window.
          Stares after him.

          But hear nothing unusual.35Phil. looks at Ginny, shrugs -
          Ginny shrugs back -
          FLASH OF LIGHT, then darkness. The signal.
          They run toward the house -
          SCREAM. Slim. Intense horrible spit of sound, replaced by an
          even more horrible silence. Deadly silence. CLOSE ON GINNY as
          they run: as if we've lost Slim and Ginny's.our new
          protagonist. As we near the house, we realize: it's not
          silence. There are sounds from inside: almost inaudible THUDS.
          Sound of a beating. On Ginny's horrified reaction -
          Baseball bat. Phil smashes a window.
          They climb through the hole into the house -INT. HOUSE. NIGHT.Silence. They move quickly, carefully toward the living room;
          it's very dark, we can hardly -MITCHAnother step and you're dead.
          Mitch emerges from darkness. Light glints off his pistol.
          Thirty feet behind him: Gracie's sleeping on the couch.
          Mitch moves and they stare in horror. Lying at his feet is
          Slim's body..
          Pain springs from Ginny's throat, she rushes to Slim -
          Mitch rams the gun into her head:MITCHDidn't you hear me?i

          Slim makes a SOUND as Ginny strokes her head...
          Mitch FIRES the gun into the wall over Ginny's head. Muffled
          sound: silencer. But he has everyone's attention now:MITCH (CONT.)This is your last chance.PHILWe are happy to leave, Sir: with
          Miss Slim and Gracie.
          Ginny's helping Slim to her knees.PHIL (CONT.)And make no mistakes. If you keep

          who will arrest you with pleasure.I/Mitch stares at Phil. Walks to him. Is he going to hit him?
          Shoot him? Mitch leans in, gun to Phil's head, and whispers:MITCHI don't want to say this in front
          of the group, but you're just a

          The others are uncertain, but Phil helps Slim up; Teddy joins
          him. Ginny tentatively follows his lead and picks up Gracie..SLIM(VERY SOFT)(This is no good.) You're
          humiliating him.GINNYWhat?SLIM(a little louder)
          He'll come after me and kill me.

          loves me.
          (off their horrified looks)
          Nobody cares like I do.
          The others stare at him in astonishment, but continue toward
          the door. Mitch leans toward Slim, whispers:MITCHSee you soon.CUT TO:INT. VAN. NIGHT.Gracie awake now in Slim's arms: staring, confused. Gentle

          Gracie looks horrified: why are you covering my -
          Slim puts her finger to her mouth: shhh.
          She takes Gracie's hand; they scurry out of sight -
          Joe hurries to the stereo, puts it on. Music to cover Gracie's

          He goes to the door, looks through the peep hole.
          Sees a LARGE MAN IN A SUIT.JOEYes?FIRST FBI MANFBI. Can we talk?
          He holds up an I.D. Not readable through the peep hole.JOEGo ahead.FIRST FBI MANWould you mind opening up?
          Joe glances over his shoulder: no sign of them. He opens the
          door, but not far enough to let the man in. Behind the large
          man are TWO OTHER MEN IN SUITS.FIRST FBI MANWe're investigating a kidnapping;
          we'd like to look around.JOEYou got a search warrant?FIRST FBI MANOh, we got a warrant all right.

          This elicits no response. Joe moves to where he can see the

          SUDDENLY we go to SLIM'S POV...she and Gracie are in a cabinet,
          looking out through a narrow horizontal slit. Watching the
          Third FBI Man makes his way methodically in their direction.
          First FBI Man stands over Joe, keeping him silent.
          Joe watches the Third FBI Man search the room...
          And then Joe blinks. Moves his eyes, and looks right in Slim's
          direction. He realizes where they must be hiding.
          The Third FBI Man's getting closer and closer to them...
          Joe realizes he has to do something. Abruptly Joe stands:JOEThat's enough.(VERY FORCEFUL)You hear me? It's time to go. Now.

          First FBI Man whirls. Suddenly he's got a knife in his hand.

          to have a knife hit your carotid?JOE(trying not to move)
          No.42Inside the cabinet, Gracie gasps. Slim puts a hand over her
          mouth. But Slim herself has to fight the impulse to burst out

          They head for the door.

          The phone rings.

          it rings again. Joe goes to it. Hesitates. Answers:JOEHello?MITCH'S VOICEThis is Mitch Tyler, Joe.JOEHello, yes, how are you?
          Joe points at phone: "It's him." He nods toward Gracie,

          armed.
          She climbs down, walks into the kitchen.
          Notices his Mr. Coffee machine is still on.
          Hesitates, turns it off.
          Opens the fridge to find something to eat -
          The alarm beeps again.
          Slim drops silently to the floor.
          SOUND of the KEY IN THE LOCK -
          Slim scuttles away as we hear:
          FRONT DOOR OPENING. FOOTSTEPS coming toward her.
          She slips around the edge of the counter just as:
          Mitch enters the kitchen. He goes to the Mr. Coffee... Looks
          at it... Frowns. Didn't he leave it on...?
          Slim in the foreground, crouched down, Mitch 15 feet away. He
          looks around. Is something wrong? Is someone here?
          Slim frozen, trying not to breath.
          Mitch listening. Wondering: should he search the place?
          She looks for a place to hide -
          He looks at his watch. He's late.
          He walks right toward Slim, curls around the counter -
          But she's not there any longer.
          He heads for the front door -102Goes out. HOLD ON the hall, where she was, where he walked.
          EMPTY. The alarm beeps again as he resets it.
          One silent beat, then Slim rises in the kitchen. (She did a360.)She sighs. Pours herself some coffee, replaces the liquid with
          water. Auto-dials her cell phone.SLIMI'm in.GINNY'S VOICEHey.SLIMCan you stay off the phone?GINNY'S VOICEFor you, honey? (Anything.)SLIMI hope so.
          She hangs up.
          Retrieves her duffle bag from its hiding place and pulls out
          tools, equipment, etc. Picks up a screwdriver and starts
          searching the apartment, checking the phone line, following it
          to the place where it enters the apartment.

          Finds the electrical box, opens it, finds the main switch.

          Walks the apartment-familiarizing herself with every inch of
          it-occasionally she moves a piece of furniture slightly... we
          realize: she's assessing fighting spaces. angles...
          She looks from one piece of furniture to another, back and
          forth, gauging the distance between them.
          She eats a snack from his refrigerator...103ILooks out the back (bedroom) window... and sees the water of theJSan Pedro harbor below her.
          Uses a metal detector to search the apartment:
          in a drawer of the night table beside his bed, she finds a
          pistol. Removes it. There are papers in the same drawer,
          notes or something. She throws these in the trash.
          She takes out three letters. As the CAMERA sweeps over one of
          them, we hear her voice:SLIM (V.0.)". .thanks for letting me come talk
          about Gracie. And I'm glad you're
          willing to admit your temper, and -
          let's not mince words - the physical
          abuse you subjected me to."
          And glances at SECOND LETTER:SLIM (V.0.)"Perhaps with your new attitude,
          we can really work something out.
          Per your last letter, I'll see you
          the evening of..."
          She puts the letters in the drawer where the pistol was.
          They're not in envelopes; they're loose, open.
          She picks up the metal detector, resumes her search.
          The machine beeps insistently around his desk. She can't find
          anything. Finally she discovers a false bottom on one of the
          drawers: a second gun is in there.
          With the gun are papers: reports from private detectives
          looking for her, an assessment of his custody rights...
          She hides the guns in the bottom of the laundry hamper.
          Finds a photo of herself with Mitch and Gracie. Rips it up.
          Puts the metal detector back in the duffle.
          Changes into sweatshirt and sweatpants.
          Takes the distinctive red bag (from the electronics store) out
          of the duffle. There's a machine inside. She plugs it in,
          tucks it behind the couch.
          Puts her cell phone beside it.104She makes one last check: every wall, surface, every drawer.
          Barefoot, she begins to glide around the space. Backing up.
          Moving with ease and grace, sliding deftly to the side as she
          approaches a couch, desk, chair. She's building on her earlier
          reconnaissance: learning where the furniture is and how to
          navigate around it...DISSOLVE TO:LATER. MAGIC HOUR.Light fading toward darkness. She's still moving backward,
          only now her sliding is smooth, graceful; almost a dance.
          As if hearing a distant signal, she slows to a stop.
          For a long moment she stands perfectly still. Poised. Like an
          animal in the forest.
          There's a chair facing the front door. She glances at it. No.
          She walks behind the couch, turns off the machine, picks up her
          cell phone and auto-dials.GINNY'S VOICEHey.

          She hangs up, turns the machine back on and stashes her cell

          Goes into the bedroom area, takes off his jacket.
          The lights go out.
          Mitch freezes, shadow on shadow, a silhouette in the darkness.
          He looks out the window, sees:
          The neighboring buildings still have light and power.
          He cocks his head, listening.

          found the pistol. Covers this by talking:MITCH {CONT.}This morning too?SLIM'S VOICEYou always did forget to turn off
          the coffee.
          He rummages in the drawer. We hear the RUSTLE of the letters
          Slim put there. He fails to find the gun. Gives up trying to
          be quiet, tosses papers onto the floor -SLIM'S VOICE {CONT.}I found it, Mitch.
          His hand leaves the drawer.
          He thinks.
          Picks up the phone, listens. Dead.
          Looks around... can't see her...
          Goes back to the chair where he hung his sports coat and fishes
          out his cell phone. We see the GLOW of its dial.
          He punches 911 and pressed SEND.
          The dial goes dark for two seconds, then blinks back on.
          He stares at it.

          Again it goes dead.SLIM'S VOICEIt's a machine. Knocks out cell

          Walks out of the bedroom area.
          Looks around the vast space.

          You have my guns.SLIM'S VOICEThrew 'em away.MITCHThen someone's here with you.SLIM'S VOICENo.MITCH(INCREDULOUS)You're alone?SLIM'S VOICEWhy not?MITCH'Cause it'd be stupid.
          Silence is her answer.MITCH (CONT.)You're sayin' this is man to man?SLIM'S VOICEWoman, Mitch.108MITCHThat's what I meant: man against
          woman - you sure that's fair?
          The lights go back on.
          Slowly Slim comes out from hiding...SLIMFair to whom?
          As he realizes her meaning, she moves into the open area
          between two couches.
          She has no weapon.
          She's barefoot, in her sweats, feet spread for balance, arms
          just slightly raised. Compared to him: she's tiny.
          He moves toward her.SLIMThis is what you wanted, right?
          What you were going to San Francisco
          for: the chance to get me alone?
          He lunges for her; she slides to the side and he misses.
          He begins to stalk her.
          And as he stalks, she moves backward, slowly and gracefully, in
          the way she was practicing.MITCHI don't understand, Slim.
          How does this work for you?
          She ignores his words. Watches his eyes and his chest. Wants
          to know where he's going to attack.MITCH (CONT.)I mean: this is carefully thought
          out, right?
          She does not respond.
          He throws three punches. None of them hits her.
          He's unfazed, keeps stalking...109MITCH (CONT.)But say you succeed - beat me up
          or whatever. You're not going to
          murder me... (CONT.)
          Her expression remains neutral, focused.
          He takes this to be agreement.MITCH (CONT.)So all you've done is further
          piss me off.SLIMSelf defense is not ,murder.
          This stops him cold.. He lowers his hands a moment. Stares at
          her, trying to assimilate this new information...MITCHYou don't have the guts.
          She just looks at him.
          He blinks, worried for an instant. Covers it with a smile:MITCHIt's not self-defense when you
          break in here and attack me.SLIMSo far you're attacking me.
          He lunges, almost hits her, rushes in -
          She has to leap sideways with great speed and dexterity: jumps
          over the couch to avoid being hit.
          He also jumps over the couch, but his balance isn't as good,
          and she's waiting for him as he stumbles -
          With perfect balance and full force, she slugs him in the nose.
          He goes down. Stays there. For the first time it occurs to
          him: this might not be easy.
          He climbs to his feet, feels his nose: blood.SLIMYou see? I'm just defending myself.
          He resumes stalking her. Only he's angry now, and it's scary.110MITCHIf you fail, you can count on this:
          you'll never see Gracie again.
          She reacts -
          He sees it, rushes her -
          Punching as he goes. From the standpoint of pure physics, he
          makes a terrifying force. Until:
          She steps back, grabs his arm, whips him vs. the brick wall -
          He hits it, bounces off.
          Cut on his forehead, blood streaming down his face.
          He stares at her... breathing hard... trying to put it together:MITCHYou really (think) ...you think you'll
          kill me and get away with it?lSLIMI told you. Self-defense. I came
          here, as arranged in our letters, to
          talk about Gracie -MITCHLetters? There are no -SLIMIn the drawer where your pistol was.
          You just left prints all over them.
          He stares at her, stunned in every way. Touches his forehead,
          feels the blood...SLIMYou attacked me, I fought back. And
          of course if you never touch me...(SWEET SMILE)I'll have to give myself bruises...
          He goes berserk. Leaps at her, covering ground quickly with
          his long stride, swinging his massive arms. This is the most
          terrifying form of combat: a huge person attacking a tiny one.
          If he should hit her even once, a glancing blow, she will go
          down, she will break, it will be over.IIIBut he misses, and misses again. Sometimes his punches are
          wild, almost comical. Others come so close we hear-the wind,
          feel their power, feel his sweat on her...
          CONTINUE this terrifying choreographed dance with destruction
          for as long as it will hold. At every instant, we fear for her
          bones and her life. Sometimes she leans back like Muhammad Ali
          to barely slip a punch, and we see terror on her face, married
          to determination. She knows the score. and the odds.
          Finally, in frustration at so many misses, he grabs an ashtray,
          hurls.it at her -
          it flies over her head -
          He punches again and again, wildly.
          She remains untouched.
          He stops. With all the blood, he looks like a wild animal.
          He makes a great effort to pull himself together...MITCHThis doesn't bother me, Slim.
          I don't care how long it takes.
          We both know: Ionly have to hit
          you once. Once, and it's over.
          She laughs at him.
          This is the last thing he expected and the last thing he can
          stand. He rushes at her again, fast -
          She starts left -
          He blocks her way -
          She starts right -
          Again he's blocking her -
          She lunges to the left, through a narrow space -
          He punches, grazing her hair; punches again, just missing, and
          a third time. We feel the awesome power behind these blows.
          She's in the clear again. Smiles casually. Clearly part of
          her strategy is to keep him angry:112SLIMI'm confused, Mitchy. Aren't you a
          man?(QUOTING HIM)I thought it was "no contest?"
          I mean, can't you hit me even once?
          He grabs a lamp, yanks out the cord, wields it like a club.SLIM (CONT.)(AMUSED)A weapon?
          He smashes the lamp down, just missing her head -SLIM (CONT.)It's a martial-arts cliche, honey.
          A weapon throws you off balance -SWISH -SWIPE -SLAM -He misses her three times, the last time smashing the lamp into
          the wall so hard that the impact hurts his hand. He yelps -SLIM (CONT.)You see?
          He turns toward her, pain on his face, holding his hand -
          And she truly attacks for the first time. Smashes her fist
          against his head -
          He flies back, bounces vs. the wall.
          As he comes off it, she punches him again -
          He roars with rage, lunges at her, head first, great speed -
          She hurtles him in the same direction, increasing speed -
          Right into the opposite wall.
          The top of his head hits the wall.
          He shudders like someone in a cartoon: a spasm running head toTOE -He drops.113Face down.
          Does not move.
          At all.
          She stares at him.
          Goes to him. Wary.
          Gives him a reflex test -
          No reaction. He's unconscious.
          She tests his neck for a pulse.
          Apparently he's still alive, because she raises her hand
          over her head.
          Her palm vertical, like a knife.
          She's about to deliver a karate chop.
          To his neck.
          it will break his neck.
          It will kill him.
          Her hand stays there, poised. CAMERA PLUNGES IN ON HER FACE.FLASHES:- Mitch hitting her the first time -
          - Midwest house, Mitch leaping out from Gracie's doorway -
          - Mitch beating her as she crawls across the floor of
          their house. (Something we didn't see before.) She reaches
          up, flicks the light switch; Mitch jumps on her back -
          - Mitch: "You'll never see Gracie again."
          - Earlier: "She's My daughter. Don't even think about
          taking her."
          - Strangling Slim, whispering: "...where you're going,
          they will never... ever... find you."114BACK TO SLIMFace contorted in rage, confusion -
          She brings her hand down -
          Misses. him.
          Intentionally.
          Turns away, tears in her eyes.
          She retrieves her cell phone, turns off the cell-phone blocker,
          presses redial.
          Stares out the window. We see the turmoil on her face, hear it
          in her voice:SLIMI can't, Gin.GINNY'S VOICE'Re you okay?SLIMYeah.GINNY'S VOICEYou're okay?!, you beat him?!SLIMYEAH -GINNY'S VOICEIt worked?!SLIMListen to me! I did it, but I can't
          do it! I can't kill him!
          Behind Slim, out of focus: movement, a soft blur...GINNY'S VOICE (CONT.)(URGENTLY)Slim. He'll come after you -SLIMI know -GINNY'S VOICE (CONT.)He'll come after Gracie -115An indistinct shape, something rising over her head...SLIMI know all that!
          I have to, but I can't!
          I'm not a killer!
          I'm not him!
          Mitch. Crazed and bloody face. In his hand: the wooden lamp.
          She senses something, turns her head slightly to one side -
          - so the lamp does not land quite flush on her skull.
          Still sends her crashing to the floor.
          Now she does not move.
          He stands over her. Looks insane: bloody, dazed, beaten: but
          triumphant.GINNY'S VOICEHello? Slim? You there?
          The lamp moving in his hand. He's rotating it. A simple
          menacing image... . and we realize: he' s aoinq to hit her again.GINNY'S VOICE {CONT.}Should I call the cops?!
          Answer me?!
          He's distracted by Ginny's voice. Picks up the phone.MITCHListen to me, bitch.
          Ginny's silent.MITCH (CONT.)if you value your children, don' t
          call anybody.
          It's over, okay? It's all over.
          He throws the phone on the couch and moves back toward Slim,
          lamp clenched tight in his fist.SMASH IN CLOSE ON HER FACE.CLOSER STILL. We're almost inside her head as we hear:INSTRUCTOR'S VOICEHold onto my voice...116Is that the hint of a smile on her face?INSTRUCTOR'S VOICE (CONT.)You're ready...
          Mitch sees the slight smile, can't believe it -
          Rage.
          He pulls his foot back to kick her -
          Her eyes are open, just a slit -
          His foot swinging forward...
          As it reaches her, she grabs it, yanks it -
          He's pulled off his feet, crashing down on top of her -
          But she's already rolling, out from under him... and up -
          Coming to her feet -
          He starts to rise, all fours, then into a crouch and ug...
          SLOW MOTION. She's ready. Her face alert. Center of gravity
          low. Arm low,.fist low... As her motion unfurls:
          Boxers say that an uppercut, perfectly
          executed, is the most difficult,
          powerful, and beautiful of punches.
          Indeed: when an uppercut starts low for maximum center-of-
          gravity and hits the opponent flush on the point of the chin -
          as Slim's does here - it delivers a devastating message to the
          central nervous system, short-circuiting it completely.
          Mitch flies backward...
          There's a table behind him.
          His head cracks on the table.
          His neck snaps.
          He lands on the floor: twisted, broken.
          Slim stares at him.
          There's no way a living man could assume the position now
          occupied by her former husband.117She stares in disbelief.
          Though she knows the answer, she feels his carotid artery.
          Her face registers what she feels. Horror, relief.
          She walks slowly to her cell phone, picks it up.
          Listens: no one there.
          She presses redial, waits...GINNY'S VOICE(in a panic)
          H o?dSLIMHi.GINNY'S VOICEOh thank God you're alive.SLIMGin, he's ...he hit his...he's not
          breathing.GINNY'S VOICEoh.SLIMYeah.GINNY'S VOICEWell: I called the cops, they're on

          Slim nods.GINNY'S VOICESlim... can you hear me?, this is
          important.
          Beat.SLIMOkay.
          As Ginny talks, Slim puts the cell-phone blocker into the
          duffle and carries the duffle to the rear of the building.GINNY'S VOICEYou're not him, okay? You're not
          him, and you never will be.118SLIMSee you soon.
          She drops the cell phone out the bedroom window into the water.
          Then the duffle. They both sink.EXT. BROWNSTONE.She comes out, sits on the steps. A siren is audible.
          Cop cars speed down the street, screech to a stop.
          TWO COPS LEAP OUT OF THE CAR, run toward her.FIRST COPYou okay?
          She looks at him, considering the question.
          Shakes her head.FIRST COPWhere is he?
          She makes a slight motion to indicate that Mitch is inside, and
          the OTHER COP runs into the apartment.
          Slim lowers her head.
          First Cop looks at her, sees the blood on her scalp.FIRST COPLooks like you're one of the lucky
          ones.
          She looks up, stares at him, and starts to cry.SMASH INTO:CREDIT SEQUENCE CREDITS OVER FLASHES:INT. LAX. DAY.Slim jumping up and down and generally making a fool of herself
