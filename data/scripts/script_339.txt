into wild applause.INT. BACKSTAGE - MOMENTS LATERAfter the taping. The rhino lumbers down the hallway

Burster," a kind of gun that shoots plastic rainbows.
Marquees announcing upcoming live appearances, etc. We
get the picture. Rainbow Randolph is the king of the
kid shows.INT. DIMLY-LIT BAR - NIGHTA suburban-looking HUSBAND and WIFE enter. They find
Rainbow Randolph sitting alone, drinking a Scotch. Hair
slicked back, sans bow tie, the friendly face no longer
looks so friendly. He nods for them to sit down. After
a nervous beat, the Husband puts a briefcase on the table
and slides it to Randolph. Randolph takes a gulp of his
Scotch. He unsnaps the briefcase and opens it. Five
grand stares him in the face.HUSBANDSo... uh... you'll make sure my
             boy dances up front, right? Where
             he'll get the most camera time?

Randolph slams the briefcase shut, startling the couple.RANDOLPHYou want your kid on the show?(CONTINUED)3.CONTINUED:HUSBANDOf... of course.WIFEYes, very much.RANDOLPHThen don't tell me how to run my

Randolph rises. He takes a final gulp of his Scotch and
picks up the briefcase.RANDOLPHI'll call you if a spot opens up.

He starts to walk off. Suddenly, the Husband and Wife
jump up from the table holding guns.HUSBANDFreeze, you cocksucker!WIFEDrop the briefcase!

Backdrops are rolled up and the giant rainbow centerpiece
is wheeled off. Workers with push brooms sweep up tons
of glittery "magic Rainbow dust."INT. NETWORK BOARDROOM - KIDNET - DAYWe are TIGHT ON the sweating face of a MAN who looks like
he's about to be executed.CUT BACK TO:4.STOKESis standing at the end of a long conference table as the
NETWORK BRASS glares at him.STOKES(addressing the brass)
          Gentlemen, let me be the first to
          say, in all sobriety, that I'm as
          shocked and outraged as all of --

The network CEO, a hog of a man, cuts him off.CEOSave it for the papers, Stokes.
          We've got nervous sponsors and an
          angry public -- a combination
          uglier than two monkeys fucking.
          What are you doing about it?STOKESWell, sir, I'm currently in the
          process of compiling a list of
          viable replacements and it's my
          hope...CEOClean replacements?    With
          background checks? I assure you,
          Mr. Stokes, this network cannot
          survive another Rainbow Randolph.
          The goddamn P.R. department looks
          like the Jim Jones camp.

Another EXECUTIVE chimes in.EXECUTIVE #1Remember, Stokes, this was your
          dog that crapped on our rug.EXECUTIVE #2We trusted you, Frank. And now
          we're in a tight spot. We have to
          post our quarterly earnings next
          month, for Christ's sake.CEOWhoever takes that slot has to be
          a straight arrow. Clean as a
          whistle.EXECUTIVE #3Right. Someone who'll take the
          heat off. One of those sweater
          types. Any chance of luring Fred
          Rogers away from P.B.S.?(CONTINUED)5.CONTINUED:EXECUTIVE #4Yeah, if we back up the Brinks
             truck.EXECUTIVE #1No way. The idea now is to stop
             the hemorrhaging.EXECUTIVE #2You better fix this, Stokes. Get
             us a white bread replacement,
             fast. Bland, milk toast. Not a
             speck of controversy.

A giant hand slams on the table. All heads snap.
The CEO drags his fingers along the shiny mahogany.
Deafening sound.CEO(calm and measured)
             Squeaky fucking clean.INT. STOKES' OFFICE - DAYStokes sits behind his mahogany desk, sipping a glass of
wine as he goes over potential Randolph replacements with

             trolls... well, who gives a shit.

Nora kicks the table in frustration.(CONTINUED)6.CONTINUED:NORAThis is impossible. If I ever see
             that Rainbow Randolph again I'll
             strangle him. Choke the life out
             of him. Squeeze his scrawny neck
             until his eyes pop out of his
             skull and bounce off the walls...STOKESBefore indulging such cheery
             fantasies, let's just concentrate
             on saving my job. Shall we?NORASorry, Frank.

Stokes flips through a thick stack of files.      He suddenly
stops at one.STOKESWhat's going on with Sheldon Mopes
             these days.

Nora laughs.NORAOh my God. Have we sunk to that
             level already? Smoochy the Rhino?
             What a sap.STOKESSap's just the pill we need right
             now. Mopes is a straight arrow.
             Always has been.NORAThe guy can't get arrested, Frank.
             He can't even break into the
             birthday party circuit. Last I
             heard he was working hospitals and
             nursing homes. He's a joke.

Stokes stands up and walks around the room.STOKESThe truth of the matter is, a
             successful children's show has
             always depended on two simple
             elements: a fuzzy costume and a
             lot of hype. Strip away the foam
             rubber and the network money and
             they're all jokes. Marginal
             talents.. cabaret acts... off-
             Broadway runoff...(CONTINUED)7.CONTINUED:NORAI probably have ten acts in my
             development file -- acts I've been
             cultivating -- that are more
             deserving than Sheldon Mopes.STOKESAnd each one a moral question
             mark. Something I can't risk at
             the moment.NORA(frustrated)
             We can do better than this guy,
             Frank. He brings nothing to the
             table.STOKESExcept ethics. With Mopes,
             there's never been a whiff of
             controversy. The man's an
             ethical, harmless, cornball. In
             short, a glass of milk on two
             legs.

Stokes stops pacing.NORADon't ask me to do it. You know
             I'll do anything for you, but
             please... not this...

Stokes gazes out the window at the city.STOKESGo find Smoochy.EXT. CONEY ISLAND - EARLY EVENINGThe lighted Ferris wheel spins CENTER FRAME. We CRANE
DOWN and eventually LAND ON a side street with the
amusement park looming in the b.g. We're in FRONT of a
small building. The half-lit neon sign reads: CONEY
ISLAND METHADONE CENTER. We DRIFT THROUGH the double
doors THROUGH the reception area where random junkies
loiter and fill out paperwork. We CONTINUE DOWN a
narrow hallway as the faint sound of someone SINGING and
playing the GUITAR INCREASES. We finally burst THROUGH
another set of doors marked "Treatment Room." The
singing now fills our ears as we PUSH IN ON the
"performer" -- a big, puffy, orange rhinoceros. Smoochy.
Or to be more specific, SHELDON MOPES.(CONTINUED)8.CONTINUED:Smoochy sits on a stool with his guitar and sings to the
patients as they stand in line before a sliding glass
window, where a nurse hands each person a little cup of
methadone which they immediately drink.

The Smoochy costume is a mass of misshapen orange foam
rubber that exposes Sheldon's painted face in the front.
A multi-colored horn protrudes from his forehead.SMOOCHY (SHELDON)(singing to the tune
                 of 'She'll be Comin'
                 round the Mountain')
             'We'll get that monkey off your
               back,
             Yes we will, yes we will
             We'll get that monkey off your
               back,
             Yes we will...'

             'We'll get that monkey off your
               back
             And get your life right back on
               track
             If you'll just give up the smack
             Yes you will, yes you will!!'

The song ends.       A few baffled junkies applaud.SMOOCHYThanks, fellas. I'm rooting for
             you!

We PAN AWAY FROM Sheldon TO the exit.      Standing there in
her coat, looking mortified, is Nora.INT. RECEPTION AREA - SHORT WHILE LATERNora sits in the reception area. Sheldon emerges in his
street clothes. He carries Smoochy's body on a hanger
over his shoulder and carries a large shopping bag which
holds Smoochy's head.NORAMr. Mopes?

Sheldon stops.SHELDONYeah?(CONTINUED)9.CONTINUED:NORAI, uh, saw your performance
             tonight. Very...
                (searching)
             ... spirited.SHELDONReally? Thanks. I would've done
             a longer set if that guy hadn't
             pulled a knife on the security
             guard. Once the pepper spray
             starts flyin', that's it for the
             encores.NORAYes, that did put a damper on the
             evening, didn't it?SHELDONAre you a new patient?   On the
             juice, as we say?NORAAh, no. But it's sweet of you to
             assume so.

She hands him her card.     He reads it.SHELDON'Nora Bishop. V.P. of
             Development. Kidnet.'
                    (to Nora)
             Good gravy. You work for Kidnet?NORAAs stated.

Sheldon grabs her hand and shakes it.SHELDONWell, it's a pleasure to meet you,
             Nora. A real honor. Hey, you
             hungry?EXT. CONEY ISLAND BOARDWALK - NATHAN'S HOT DOGS - SHORTWHILE LATERSheldon and Nora stand at the crowded counter at
Nathan's. Sheldon ravenously eats his sloppily-
garnished, oddly colored hot dog. Nora winces as
she watches him.(CONTINUED)10.CONTINUED:SHELDON(with full mouth)
             Soy dogs... never thought I'd
             live to see the day. Organic,
             rich in natural protein, and
             nobody gets killed. Although I
             do feel bad for the beans. Just
             kidding. Sure you don't want one?NORABelieve it or not, no.

He takes another bite.SHELDONSo anyway, like I was saying,
             people always tell me, 'You gotta
             network, Sheldon... you gotta sell
             yourself... or you'll be playing
             the drug clinics and shopping
             centers the rest of your life.'
             And you know what I tell 'em?NORAI haven't the foggiest.SHELDONI tell 'em, it's not about the old
             handshake and back slap game.
             It's not about adding fuel to the
             shlock machine. It's about doing
             good work. Having integrity.
             Making people happy and delivering
             a positive message. Foundations
             are built with concrete, not
             plaster of Paris!

He pulls the stained, misshapen Smoochy head from the
shopping bag.SHELDONThis is concrete!   This is
             integrity!NORA(calmly)
             I can see that.

Sheldon realizes his voice was getting too loud.SHELDONSorry. As you can imagine, living
             by your convictions can be a
             little stressful at times.(CONTINUED)11.CONTINUED:NORAWe all have our cross to bear.SHELDONSee, I was raised by my
             grandfather, and Grandpop paved
             driveways for a living...NORAAre we going into a story?SHELDONThing is, he didn't really pave
             them. Just covered them with
             black paint. Of course, once the
             first rain came along, people
             realized they'd been swindled. I
             vowed to myself back then that I'd
             never make a living through
             deception. Never. Whadda ya
             think of them apples?

Nora looks glassy-eyed.      She takes a deep breath.NORAThe reason I'm here today, Mr.
             Mopes, as fate would have it,
             Kidnet is currently looking for a
             performer with... convictions.
             And integrity. Someone like...

She almost chokes on the word.NORA... yourself.

Sheldon laughs.SHELDONYeah, right. Got any more jokes?NORAI don't think I could top that
             one.SHELDONHold the phone. You're telling me
             that Kidnet is finally ready to do
             a show of Smoochy quality? Of
             Smoochy caliber?(CONTINUED)12.CONTINUED:NORA(dryly)
             Yes... I believe we're ready to
             push ourselves to that level.SHELDONI knew this day   would come!
             After all these   years I finally
             meet someone in   the business who
             gets what I do.    Who gets what I'm

END of prep MONTAGE.EXT. DOCK BY RIVER - NIGHT (POURING RAIN)A disheveled Randolph paces on a deserted dock. The
Brooklyn Bridge looms in the b.g. A car pulls up in the
b.g. Stokes gets out. Randolph moves under an awning.RANDOLPHI was starting to think that maybe
             you weren't coming.STOKESI agreed to meet you, didn't I?    I
             had a dinner engagement.

Randolph takes a swig from a flask.RANDOLPHReally? You know, I used to have
             dinner engagements. Sometimes
             four, five a night. Dinner...

             Cars, boats, whores and horses, I
             had 'em all. When I walked into a
             restaurant, ten guys reached for
             my hat. When I stood up to take a
             piss, they cleared the rest room.
             I'd walk down the street and
             traffic stopped, mouths gaped.
             You know why? You know why,

             don't have time for me? The guy

drink and talking to the BARTENDER. He seems slightly
drunk.SHELDON... No, no, you misunderstand me.
          It's not that I'm literally
          comparing Captain Kangaroo to
          Jesus Christ. I'm just saying
          that the Captain, like Christ, was
          someone you could believe in.

          is that sad?BURKEYou know, years ago, a client of

          problem...SHELDONWow, you represented Dicky Gimble?BURKEYeah, before the asshole found
          religion. Anyway, Stokes was
          trying to screw my boy out of some
          merchandising points. Claimed he
          had a warehouse full of Dicky
          dolls that weren't moving. Now
          Frank and I are old friends, so I
          say to him, 'Okay, cock, show me

bags, broken egg shells, flour bags, butter wrappers,
mixing bowls and other baking ingredients. The PAN ENDS
ON Randolph, who stands over a barrel fire, holding a
spatula. A cookie sheet rests on the barrel. Randolph
removes the cookie sheet and gazes at it gleefully. We
now see that the cookies are phallic-shaped.RANDOLPHAh! They're beautiful! A perfect
             batch of cock cookies for a very

stops. He looks back at her.SHELDONWe have different eyes, Nora.
             When I go out there I see kids.
             You see wallets with pigtails.

He moves on. Nora stares at him as he walks away. He
obviously got to her. As Sheldon heads toward the
studio, he doesn't notice the two beady eyes staring
at him from under the stairwell. After a beat,
Randolph emerges and slinks backstage. He's
clutching a duffle bag.25.INT. PROP ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTIONRandolph sneaks into the prop room and shuts the door.
He scurries over to the prop shelf and locates Smoochy's
multicolored "magic cookie bag." He opens it and tosses
the cookies into the trash can. Reaching into his
pockets, he pulls out his special homemade cookies. He
chuckles as he dumps them into the magic cookie bag.RANDOLPHBon soir, la Smoochy.   Welcome to
          fatty Arbuckle-land.

He cackles to himself. He then notices a box in the
corner of the room. Scribbled in magic marker on the
side are the words: "Rainbow Randolph crap." He walks
over and pulls the box out. He slowly opens the flaps.
Inside is his old costume. He pulls it out and clutches
it lovingly. He smells it. The ECHOEY SOUND of his
THEME SONG comes flooding back to him for a moment,
along with the sound of CHILDREN LAUGHING.RANDOLPH(softly to himself)

kids dance frenetically. The kids in the bleachers are
in hysterics as Smoochy shakes his body spastically. The
song finally ends. The kids in the bleachers jump to
their feet, cheering and applauding.SMOOCHYBoy, all that jiggyin' and

out at the city. He drinks orange juice straight from
the carton.

she's holding a pint of whiskey.SHELDONUh... are you okay?NORAI'm getting drunk and I'm not used
          to it.SHELDONOh. Well, not to make you feel

city.NORAI... I may have been a little
             harsh when we spoke the other day.

             when you're berating me.

Nora looks down.NORAI'm afraid I have become a bit
             hardened over the years.

audio system on the fireplace wall.RANDOLPHDid you put on a little weight,

Randolph takes another drink from the vodka bottle.
Sheldon suddenly lunges at Randolph and tries to grab
the gun. Randolph shrieks. The two men wrestle on the
floor, but Randolph is not much of a fighter. He
screams as Sheldon rolls him toward the fireplace.SHELDONIs this what you want? A Hansel

Randolph rolls Sheldon to the bottom. Nora reaches for a
fireplace poker and whacks Randolph with it. Randolph
cries out and drops the gun. Sheldon grabs it and points
it at Randolph who lies on the floor, blubbering like a
child. He's bleeding.RANDOLPHGo ahead, kill me! Finish me off.

Sheldon slowly takes the gun away from Randolph's head.SHELDONYou're not nothing. You're
             bitter, misguided and I'm guessing
             a raging alcoholic, but you're

eyes.(CONTINUED)103.CONTINUED:RANDOLPHWould you be my friend?SHELDONSure.RANDOLPH(to Nora)

his shoulder. Sheldon pats his back. He glances down at
Randolph's gun and sees that it's a toy.

Nora pours vodka onto a small pillow she's taken from
one of the chairs. She kneels next to Randolph and blots

music. A wounded Rhinette falls to the ice, but no one
notices. Smoochy, oblivious, continues to skate toward
the "gates of heaven" with the angel Moochy. Giant white
gates slowly swing open at the rink's far end as floating
angels open their arms to welcome Moochy.OUTER RINKRandolph runs around the rink's perimeter, trying to get
Sheldon's attention. Cops and security push their way
towards Randolph. He suddenly notices the felled
Rhinette on the ice and looks skyward. He can make out
a rifle barrel protruding from the catwalk.NETWORK BOXStokes and Burke notice a commotion in the audience.

way to the stairwell.(CONTINUED)113.CONTINUED:STOKES(whispering to Burke)

rifle barrel.ANGLE - NORAjumps to her feet.      FAST PUSH IN TO Nora's mouth.NORA(screaming)

Stokes tries to put his arm around her.STOKESNora, please. It's not what you
             think. I'm grooming you. You're
             going to run the division one
             day...

She pushes him. He goes down hard. She starts to climb
out of the box. Burke tries to grab her, but she spins
around and punches him. She runs for the rink.

Stokes stands in the box looking dumbstruck as pande-
monium plays out around him. People are running in all
directions, cops are everywhere.STOKES(frightened; to Burke)

Burke runs off through the panicked crowd. Stokes looks
around and heads off in the opposite direction.114.OUTSIDE RINKTommy and her boys notice the commotion in the audience.

Randolph. Tommy, Jimmy and Sammy take off after him.CATWALKBuggy, in position again, looks through the rifle scope.POV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPEAs the soprano reaches for an impossibly high note, the

too high and just missed Sheldon's skull.(CONTINUED)115.CONTINUED:A confused Sheldon bends over to pick up a chunk of the
Smoochy head.

Nora, who's entered at the opposite end of the rink,
tries to reach him, but it's impossible. Panicked
audience members run across the rink, heading for the
exits. It's chaos. People slip, Rhinettes get trampled.CATWALKRandolph tries to get the rifle away from Buggy. They
struggle on a narrow beam high above the rink. The cops
have reached the outer edge of the catwalk now. Tommy
and the boys get there a second later. They all stand
back -- the catwalk is too unstable.RANDOLPHGive me that gun, you fucking
             wacked-out freak!

Buggy manages to shove Randolph off him. He raises the
RIFLE and SHOOTS at the cops. Randolph grabs him. Both
he and Buggy lose their footing and slip from the
catwalk. Randolph is able to grab onto the edge and hold
on. Buggy clutches Randolph's leg which threatens to
bring them both down. They dangle 80 feet above the
rink. Randolph desperately tries to hold onto the
catwalk as Buggy clings to Randolph's ankle.CLOSE ON RANDOLPH'S FINGERSHis knuckles turn white as his fingers start to slip from

help Randolph off the catwalk. He's a nervous wreck.COP #1You okay?RANDOLPHI don't know. I'm kind of fucked
          up in general, so it's hard to
          gauge.

They pat the dazed Randolph on the back.   He passes out.RINKPeople continue to run through the rink. Felled
Rhinettes litter the ice like broken dolls. Smoke fills
the air. Sheldon is helping a random woman to her feet
as Nora finally reaches him. She embraces him.NORABurke's with Stokes.   He's been in
          it all along.

Sheldon looks toward the network box. Beyond it, through
the smoke, he sees Burke shoving his way through people
who jam the exit trying to escape. Sheldon reaches into
his costume and pulls out his gun.NORANo, Sheldon, don't!

Sheldon runs off leaving Nora.EXITBurke is almost through the cluster of people. He
glances over his shoulder and sees Sheldon heading
toward him. He shoves even harder now and finally
gets through.EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTIONBurke makes a run for it down 33rd Street. A moment
later, Sheldon emerges from the building. He sees Burke
in the distance and takes off after him. He's still in
his skates and wearing the partially-blown-off Smoochy
head.117.FURTHER DOWN STREETBurke looks behind and sees the nightmarish image of a
disfigured Smoochy chasing after him. He quickly rounds
the corner.EXT. STREETA few moments later Sheldon rounds the corner. He looks
down the street and sees no sign of Burke. He notices an
alley by an abandoned building.EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS ACTIONSheldon walks slowly into the alley, gun drawn.
Suddenly, Burke jumps out from behind some boxes. He
whacks Sheldon's head with a garbage can lid. The gun
goes flying. Burke goes for it, but Sheldon is quickly
on his feet and pounces on him. The two men fight it
out. Burke manages to get on top of Sheldon and starts
to strangle him.BURKEYou fucking point a gun at me? A
          gun I gave you as a gift?! Where's
          your fucking etiquette?

Just as Sheldon begins to lose consciousness, we hear a
GUNSHOT. Burke looks up. Nora stands there, pointing
Sheldon's gun directly at him.NORALet him go.

Burke just looks at her.NORANow. Before I pump one in that
          Grecian Formula scalp of yours.

Burke smirks as he releases Sheldon. Sheldon jumps up
and takes the gun from Nora. He shakily points it at
Burke.BURKEYou know something, kid? You've
          turned out to be an incredible
          pain in the ass.

Burke slowly stands up, brushing off his suit.SHELDONYou were behind the Spinner hit,

             less mick in the world.

He laughs.NORAYou son-of-a-bitch.

Sheldon cocks the gun.BURKEOh my. What are you gonna do?
             Kill me? That wouldn't be very
             Smoochy-like behavior.SHELDONYou're right. There's just one
             thing...

Sheldon tears off the remains of his tattered costume and
steps out of it.SHELDONI'm not Smoochy.

Sheldon is shaking as he extends the gun to Burke's head.SHELDONI finally realized we're living in
             a different jungle.

Burke suddenly looks fearful, as does Nora.NORANo, Sheldon.

Sheldon closes his eyes as he tries to summon up the
courage to pull the trigger.NORASheldon!

Suddenly, there's a voice from behind.VOICE (O.S.)Don't do it, Shel.

Sheldon turns around.       It's Tommy and her boys.(CONTINUED)119.CONTINUED:SHELDON(sternly)
             Stay out of it, Tommy.   This is my
             business.

Tommy walks closer to Sheldon.TOMMYNo more killin', Shel. Enough's
             enough. Don't destroy who you are
             for this piece of shit. You mean
             something to the kids. Don't take
             Smoochy away from the kids.

Tommy extends her hand for the gun. Sheldon looks down
at the gun. He can't believe he's even holding it. He
hands it to Tommy.SHELDONI don't know how I got pushed this
             far.TOMMYYou're only human, Shel. The
             important thing is... you never
             went over the cliff. You're a
             good boy. For some of us... it's
             too late.

Tommy pats Sheldon's shoulder affectionately.TOMMYWe'll take it from here, kid, you
             run along with your girl. Get on
             with your life.

Sheldon looks over at Burke, who's petrified.SHELDONTommy, you're not going to --TOMMYDon't worry. Sometimes even a
             rat deserves a little mercy.

Sheldon and Nora take a final look at Burke before
walking out of the alley. Burke is wide-eyed with fear
as Tommy's boys advance on him. Just as they round the
corner there is the sound of TWO GUNSHOTS. Sheldon looks
at Nora.NORABus backfire.

She pats him on the back.120.EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTIONStokes finally makes it out of the arena. He runs toward
his waiting limo and hops in the back seat. He barks to
his driver through the glass partition.STOKESGet out of here!

The car doesn't move.   Stokes pounds on the partition.STOKESMove this thing!

No response. Stokes frantically pushes the button that
lowers the partition. It slides down.STOKESAre you deaf?! I said --

The driver turns around. Stokes recoils in horror. It's
Takashi. He smiles as the back doors open and the
Japanese thugs -- Chick, Sambo and Tobi -- pile in with
Stokes. They slam the doors shut.CHICKI wish I could tell you it'll be
          quick and painless, Frank, but you
          know how these things go...

Stokes lets out a small whimper. Chick nods to Takashi
who steps on the gas as he sings "Anything Goes" in
Japanese.EXT. TH AVENUE - CONTINUOUS ACTIONThe car heads into the night, passing Sheldon and Nora,
who have exited the alley. This will be Frank Stokes'
final limo ride.EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTIONSheldon and Nora pause on the street.    Sheldon looks
around him.SHELDONYou know, a little grime here and
