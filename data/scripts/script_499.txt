Security treatment facility for male and female psychiatric
patients. Its primary clientele are those who have histories
of committing criminal offenses and are either committed to the
Department of Mental Health by the Circuit Courts of the State
or who are admitted under authority of an appointed guardian.FADE IN:OPENING CREDITS OVER QUICK CUTS:INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S BEDROOM - DAWNPUSH in on a sleeping couple in the dark. The ALARM
CLOCK reads 5:59 AM. The woman's eyes open a second
before the alarm beeps and turns it off. She grabs a
glass of water on her bedside table and drinks it.
Climbs out of bed past typical bedside photographs
(wedding, vacation, etc.). This is MIRANDA GREY: 30,
sharp and prettier than she knows.INT. GYM SWIMMING POOL - MORNINGMiranda slides through the water. Swimming cap on,
goggles. Her STEADY BREATHING takes us in and out of the
water. Something unsettling about this sound. Something
slightly unsettling too about her detached manner. A
person on autopilot, recognizing only the water and the
perfectly aligned lap stripes leading her path. Like
graphic metaphors for her own conscience: flat. She
emerges from the pool and self-consciously wraps herself
in a towel.INT. COFFEEHOUSE - MORNINGMiranda pays for a pair of coffees and a newspaper.INT. KITCHEN - MORNINGMiranda's husband DOUGLAS GREY (older, a superficial
analysis would suggest a father figure) serves breakfast.
Miranda smiles thank you and goes back to studying a case
file. He sips from his takeout coffee and reads the
newspaper. A pleasant domestic scene. It's 8:00 AM.EXT. ST. ANNE'S HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNINGMiranda's Volvo pulls in as students amble up the steps.

Almost. TWO ORDERLIES appear at the door. Miranda nods

They have reached an office marked "DR. PHILLIP PARSONS
DIRECTOR" and peer in to see Parsons (50's,
distinguished, commands respect from everyone) on the
phone. He gestures for Pete to sit. Miranda is about to
exit when he covers the mouthpiece --PARSONSMiranda, my wife keeps wanting to

             perfectly natural. I'm going to

The girl suddenly grips Miranda's arm.         Hard.MIRANDADon't be scared. It's going to be
             fine.
Now the girl is touching Miranda's face. Her movements
desperate, smothering. Like the movements of a drowning
person. Miranda tries to push the girl's hands back down.MIRANDAHands off me, okay? Tell me your
             name, do you remember your name?
The girl tries to speak but no words come out. Instead
she produces a strained, wettish sound. Creepy as hell.

stronger than expected and Miranda is panicking --(CONTINUED)9.CONTINUED:MIRANDAWhat are you doing? I'm trying to

The girl opens her own mouth wide like a snake. And as
Miranda muffles a scream, blood starts leaking out of the
girl's eye sockets and from wounds all over her body.SLAM CUT TO:INT. BEDROOM - DAWNMiranda wakes up in a cold sweat.         Just a bad dream.    A
beat.
FAINT at first but GROWING LOUDER, we hear a REPETITIVE
SOUND outside. Like an ECHO of some sort, but vaguely
familiar: THWIP, THWIP, THWIP.
Miranda takes a deep breath, reaches for the glass of
water on her bedside table. Except... it's not there.
She turns to her husband but he's not in the bed. And
now she glances around the room and realizes this is not
her bedroom.
She climbs off the bed and walks in the dark. Trips over
something. A TRAY that CLANGS LOUDLY. Her heartbeat
goes haywire. She feels her way along the wall to a
small opening in the door. A glass pane.
She peers through the glass at the empty corridor
outside, realizing what this must mean, realizing she's
inside a cell.
She jiggles the handle and pounds on the door, frantic --MIRANDAHello?   Somebody help me!EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - ESTABLISHING - DAYCAMERA SOARS through the tall iron gates, past the guard.

Peter is half-listening to her, half-signaling to the

this, growing more agitated. She wears the uniform all
patients wear: a white T-shirt and sweats. Her wedding
ring is gone.(CONTINUED)11.CONTINUED:MIRANDAWhat are you doing?PETEGiving you something to calm down.MIRANDAI don't need to calm down.   What I

room almost void of any color. Monochromatic. It takes
her a moment to orient herself. Her eyes wander across
the unfamiliar room, feeling like she's being watched.
We become aware of a RAGGED BREATHING sound. Like
somebody is standing over her bed. But we don't see
anything. Miranda gingerly crosses to the door and peeks
through the glass partition into the empty corridor. She
glances back at the room, stills seeing nothing -- and
bangs on the door.(CONTINUED)22.CONTINUED:MIRANDACan I get some assistance here?

A light is switched on down the corridor.

Miranda tries to appear composed. Wipes sweat off her
forehead. Fixes her hair. The FOOTSTEPS now STOP right
out side the door. A KEY goes into the lock and JIGGLES
it.
Miranda waits for the door to open but nothing happens.
Confused, she steps up to the glass partition and
peeks --
The second her face touches the glass, she is met by a
pair of piercing eyes. The eerie teenage girl. Miranda
jumps back, screams.
And when she looks up again, the image is gone.      A beat.

             stuff I don't need to know. My
             point is about people talking
             behind other people's backs. Like
             before I was here, everything I
             did I thought, 'this'll get them,'

             back. But now I'm more anonymous,
             more myself. I'm Shelley.

to how to get out of this conversation, but Shelley has
no problem holding a conversation all by herself --SHELLEYYou're not like, undercover here,
             are you? They pulled that at

the shower. Something vaguely concentration camp-like
about institutional bathing.(CONTINUED)28.CONTINUED:The shower, like everything else in this place, is
regulated by shifts, so that various groupings of
patients each get their turn. Miranda feels Chloe's gaze
on her across the room. She is stripping off her clothes
for Miranda's benefit, gleefully mangling the last
refrain from the Stones' "START ME UP."IRENE(checking watch)

The first group of bathers file out, dripping wet past
Miranda, in all shapes and sizes. She registers their
many scars and tattoos, like maps of troubled souls:
names of men, places, religious quotes. Burn scars,
cuts, needle marks. They begin to towel off as Miranda,
slowly and painfully self-conscious, begins to undress in
the corner.

eyes, trying to shut it all out.

and her RAGGED BREATHING. Chloe and Shelley, the last
two out from the previous group, grab towels.
Chloe winks at Miranda when she catches her staring, but
Miranda is not staring at her. She is staring past her
at the tile wall.
More specifically at a hole in the tile where a busted
water pipe pokes out. Clearly at some point there was a
handle there, but now it is just a hole with a busted
pipe.
PUSH INTO the hole to see a perfectly-formed globule of
blood emerge, following by a GURGLING sound which seems
to come from deep in the bowels of the plumbing system.
The blood lingers tentatively, as if unfamiliar with the
laws of gravity, before tracing an upward line along the
tile. The GURGLING GROWS LOUDER, CLOSER, and now more
blood flows from the hole and spreads up the wall.
Miranda looks away, disturbed, and now realizes she is
the only one left in the showers. Panic. Shuts her
eyes.(CONTINUED)29.CONTINUED:MIRANDA(to self)

Ryan emerges from his patrol car. Miranda nods.MIRANDAIt's about Pete.PARSONSWhat about him?MIRANDAPerhaps he's not the most
             qualified person to be treating

His tone is fatherly yet direct.PARSONSAre you complaining about his
             methods or are you referring to

This surprises her.(CONTINUED)36.CONTINUED:MIRANDAWhat did he tell you?PARSONSHe explained there might be a
             conflict of interest because he
             has feelings for you. You two
             engaged in a kiss at one point.
             Am I right?MIRANDAYes.PARSONSI told him we're all grownups here
             and the fact is he's the best doctor
             on my staff. As such, and given the
             severity of the charges you face, I
             consider him the most qualified person
             to assist your recovery. Now, if
             you'll excuse me, Sheriff Ryan is
             not a patient man.
Stonewalled in the simplest of ways, she's left feeling
like an idiot. Watches Parsons join the Sheriff by his
car. The two men shake hands when suddenly Irene runs
past her, yelling --IRENEHey!   Chloe!
Now two ORDERLIES race past. Miranda looks over to see
what the fuss is all about. Chloe is on top of an
institute staff member we haven't seen before, a round
black woman named CONSUELO. Punching her --

The orderlies haul Chloe off. Irene disperses the crowd.
Consuelo sighs, embarrassed, wipes a bloody lip. Her
manner says she just wants to get back to her duties.
Excitement over, the patients resume whatever it is they
were doing.
Miranda stares at her bleak surroundings when something

grabs the heavy axe from the floor and follows him. He
reaches for the coffee table with the telephone on it and
makes a move to grab it. He has all the speed of a dying
turtle, and that's pretty much what he resembles.
Miranda bites her lip, lifts the heavy axe with both hands.
Doug's hand grabs the phone. Miranda SWINGS THE AXE over
her head and it comes down straight AT CAMERA.

the mirror over the mantel and stares --

watches the blood wash off her. As if finally coming

the door with her fingers, feeling along the wall --
still making sure she isn't dreaming this.
She looks down the long, empty corridor, the glare of
neon lights making her readjust her eyes momentarily.
Nobody there. But when she looks down the other way she
sees a pair of bare feet disappear behind the wall. So
quick we're not sure we saw it for sure.
Miranda deliberately walks in the opposite direction.
At night the clinical corridor takes on an unsettling
quality. She silently strolls down the hall, tilting her
head at the various sounds from PATIENTS in their cells.
She turns to make sure Rachel isn't behind her and when
Miranda faces forward again, she realizes she is standing
right across from:THE NURSES' STATIONWhere two nurses are watching TELEVISION. Miranda tiptoes
past them, ducking at the window to remain unseen.ANOTHER CORRIDORThis one is wider. Miranda is startled by the sudden

as she heads towards her old office. She turns a corner
and stops in her tracks: another JANITOR making his
rounds. She waits until he's out of sight and rushes to
her office.
She pulls out the stolen screwdriver and brings it to the
lock. Starts unscrewing the screws. She does this as
fast as she can, but she's no professional -- so it takes
a few tries. She loosens one screw, then another -- and
clumsily drops the screwdriver. The METAL ECHOES against
the floor.
Miranda sucks her breath in, waits. No footsteps. She
bends down, retrieves it, and holds onto the knob for
balance. It easily turns in her hand. It was open all
along. She simply forgot to check.INT. MIRANDA'S OFFICEMiranda shuts the door behind her and slips behind her

Andrea White.
Miranda pockets it, looks back at the surveillance

Miranda's heart is nearly bursting through her chest as
she gets closer and closer to the emergency door. Twenty

pins her down.

deep breath and lets herself in through the back door.INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSEPOLICE CRIME-SCENE TAPE everywhere. She turns on the

even looking in the direction of the living room,
avoiding the scene of the gruesome crime altogether.

She looks in the rearview mirror once more.      Only this
time she is met by a piercing pair of eyes.
Rachel's.     Inside the car.
Rachel's mouth opens unnaturally wide, revealing a gaping
abyss of rotted teeth and flesh -- and lets out the wet
sound. A threatening howl this time, pure venom.
Miranda covers her face, jerks the car. It does a 180
and slides to a halt in the middle of the street --
Facing the direction of her house again.EXT. STREETMiranda jumps out, panicked. Glances around. Looks
inside the car: no Rachel. A beat to catch her breath,
making up her mind. Slides behind the wheel and makes a
U-turn.INT. SIMON'S CAR - MOVING - CONTINUOUS ACTIONMiranda flips the rearview mirror so it faces the ceiling
and turns UP the RADIO. GUNS the pedal. Freaked.
She's driven maybe 20 feet when suddenly her ENGINE DIES --MIRANDANo.
The CAR SPUTTERS to a stop. Miranda goes to turn the key
but suddenly freezes. Looks at the ignition oddly and
notices the key is gone.MIRANDAWhy are you doing this to me?
A dead-still beat. Glancing around, she is even more
startled to see the blue lighter key chain lying in the
middle of the street.69.EXT. STREET - NIGHTMiranda opens her car door and walks down the empty
street to retrieve her suddenly magical keys.
We watch her reach the keys, all alone out here. The
moment she bends down to pick it up she is blinded by the
glare of HEADLIGHT and the ROAR OF AN ENGINE. Miranda
jumps out of the way, narrowly avoiding being flattened
by a ROAD SWEEPER, spraying water as it goes.
She watches the truck disappear down the block. Heart in
her throat. Calms her nerves and now walks over to the
pesky keys again. Smack in the middle of a puddle now.
BOOM UP the posts harnessing power lines which surround
the area until we STOP ON a pair of INDUSTRIAL BOLTS
fastened around the insulators of a thick power line.
From here we see Miranda bend down and pick up her keys.
And now the bolts suddenly shake off their hinges, coming
loose right in front of our eyes -- moved by some
invisible force --
Miranda tilts her head at the sound of a METALLIC SNAP
and turns. The bolts pop out of their sockets. The LIVE
WIRE uncoils like some gigantic serpent and swings
straight towards the paralyzed Miranda --
She looks down at her feet, ankle-deep in the puddle,
back up at the 11,000 VOLTS OF POWER about to fry her to
a crisp and jumps out of the way at the last second. The
wire hits the water and the monumental charge sends
SPARKS flying in every direction. It looks like
lightning.
A silent, sudden beat.   That was as close as close gets.MIRANDA(fighting tears)
          What do you want from me?
No sign of Rachel. Miranda yells at the air, glancing
over her shoulder, seemingly demented:MIRANDAWhat is it you want me to do?!!
A moment. Miranda stranded. The stolen car in the
middle of the road. And now the SQUEAK of a GATE OPENING
abruptly. Miranda whips her head in the direction of the
sound.
It's the front gate to her house. And now the front door
SWINGS OPEN. And now the living room LIGHTS switch on.(CONTINUED)70.CONTINUED:Clearly Rachel wants her back in the house.MIRANDAI can't.

             Please, please don't make me go
             back in there.
But even as she's saying this her feet are moving towards
it. She pauses, looks at the car in the middle of the
road. Looks at the fizzling puddle where she was almost
electrocuted. No neighbors have come out to investigate
yet, but how long can that last? She walks to the car.INT. SIMON'S CARMiranda climbs in, not sure whether to laugh or cry here.
She's never asked a ghost for permission before:MIRANDABear with me, I'm just parking it
             out of the way so it won't look
             suspicious in the middle of the

She STARTS the ENGINE and pulls over to the sidewalk.INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSEMiranda stands in her living room, staring at her
handiwork. Frozen with dread.
The blood has been cleaned up some, but the mess remains.
The upturned furniture covered in plastic, the chalk
outline of the body, the yellow crime-scene tape, the
shattered mirror above the fireplace, the muddied
footprints of dozens of cops, coroners, etc.
The faded writing on the wall:       "NOT ALONE."
Miranda takes it all in, not entirely sure what she's
supposed to be looking for.MIRANDA(piecing it together)

TELEVISION SET suddenly COMES TO LIFE, making her jump.
The unmistakable MUSIC from some old WB cartoon at FULLBLAST.She stares at the TV screen. Is there some sign here she
should be able to follow? She crosses to turn it off and
immediately doubles over in pain --MIRANDAShit.
She looks at her foot. A big SHARD OF GLASS is stuck
right through the flimsy hospital slipper into her skin.
Blood already seeping from the nasty cut --INT. BATHROOMMiranda seated on the edge of the tub, slowly pulls out
the piece of glass, drops it in the wastebasket. She
grabs a cotton ball and alcohol and starts cleaning the
cut.
And now, FAINT at first, but GROWING LOUDER -- she hears
the hollow WET SOUND we've come to associate with Rachel.
Inside the room with her --
Miranda stares at the medicine cabinet. Did the mirror
move? We watch her from the MIRROR POV as she holds
perfectly still, listening. The SOUND now seems to have
STOPPED. A silent beat.
She turns her attention back to cleaning her cut, grimacing
as the alcohol burns her skin. It looks painful.
And now the slow SQUEAK of the MEDICINE CABINET DOOR makes
her look up again. And she sees herself in the mirror like
the night of the slaughter: flames all around her. Naked
arms raised. Wrists shackled. Anima Sola.
She stares.     Mesmerized.    The sound of FLAMES GROWINGLOUDER.MIRANDANo.   No.   No...
Miranda walks slowly to the mirror. Incredibly, the
image reflecting back at her also grows bigger. As if
the two versions of her are literally walking towards
each other. FROM A SIDE ANGLE WE SEE both their faces
mere inches apart. Miranda brings her fingertips to the
mirror and touches it. Immediately pulls her hand back.(CONTINUED)72.CONTINUED:Miranda stares at her fingertips. The tips are burnt.
The skin sizzles softly. 200 percent scientifically
impossible. And when she looks up at the mirror again --
the image is gone.



It is now deathly quiet. And what she finds herself
staring at in the mirror is the reflection of something
just behind her. A folded newspaper discarded in the far
corner of the room.
She turns to look at it now. It's opened to the REALTY
LISTINGS page. Doug must have left it there. She picks
it up and looks closer: Focusing on a picture of a bank-
repossessed property.
The address is in Willows Creek.
Her brain wires start clicking. This must be what Rachel
wanted her to see. She stares at it.
PUSH IN ON the picture as we --MATCH CUT TO:EXT. WILLOWS CREEK PROPERTY - DAWNA "FOR SALE" sign still flapping in the wind.   The first
few rays of light break through the dawn sky.
Miranda's (Simon's) car approaches up the road until it
FILLS the FRAME and parks. Miranda steps out.
She studies the house before walking up the drive. We
watch her peek through windows and walk around back,
looking for something. What exactly, we don't know.
(Neither does she.)
She makes her way back to the starting point and fixes
her stare now on the barn. The one place he hasn't
looked.INT. BARNDark, empty. The WIND outside causes the ALUMINUM SIDING
to FLAP NOISILY. It's slightly unnerving, but hey, it's
just the wind. Miranda covers the distance of the large
room, perplexed. There is something about this place.
Something she can't quite put her finger on. Beckoning
her.
With a last fruitless look, she heads towards the front
door when a glint of mental in the opposite corner stops
her. She moves to it.(CONTINUED)73.CONTINUED:And here, where the walls should meet, there is a narrow
gap, leading to a passage, maybe five inches wide. A
padlocked chain has been threaded through a hole in both
walls, holding them together. Miranda inspects the heavy
padlock, the source of the glint. She tugs on the wall
and opens it to the limits of the chain, but that's only
a few inches more. Miranda peers into the darkness
beyond, but can't see a thing.
Hesitating only a moment, she turns sideways and slides
herself into the claustrophobic slot.
She moves forward cautiously a few feet until her face
brushes against something hanging in the air. She stops,
startled. It's a pull-string hanging from a naked light
bulb.
She tugs on it. And now she has 60 watts of reddish glow
to see the hatch on the floor immediately in front of
her. She pulls on the LATCH and it opens with a RUSTY
CREAK. She peers into the pitch-black basement below.
Feels around for the beginning of a stepladder and climbs
down.INT. SECRET BASEMENTMiranda emerges from the ladder into total darkness.
Whatever dim reddish light was provided by the bulb
upstairs does not reach here. She feels around the wall
for a switch. Nothing.MIRANDA(to self)
             It's not shrink-appropriate to be
             afraid of the dark, right?
Abruptly there's a sharp CLICK as she lights Simon's key-
chain lighter, and the wavery light illuminates the vast
space. Rats scurry for cover. It takes a second to orient
ourselves. Something metallic catches the lighter's
reflection way in back. Miranda walks towards it.MIRANDAHello?
She takes a few more steps until her foot hits a bulk on
the floor. She stops. Kneels down and in the dim half-
light we make out a backpack. She unzips it and rifles
through it (T-shirts, underwear, Walkman) until she finds
a wallet. Opens the billfold and brings the lighter next
to the ID: the picture belongs to a teenager named"TRACY MARIE SEAVER."(CONTINUED)74.CONTINUED:MIRANDAIs there anybody here?   Hello?
The lighter in her hand is getting hot, so she lets it
click off. When it comes back on we see she has wrapped
a ragged T-shirt around it for insulation.
Miranda steps deeper into the room. Up ahead, she can
make out the metallic thing that reflected light before.
It is a hook in the ceiling. And suspended from it are
several heavy chains.
Like a meat rack.
And now she catches a whiff of the terrible smell and
sees the body of the teenage girl: hanging upside down,
tied around the hands and ankles.
Medical training kicking in, Miranda quickly lowers the
girl to the ground, causing the angry rats to skitter
away.MIRANDAGo away!   Fuck off!
(We see the following in between flicks of the lighter so
that we go from midnight black to wavery light in an
almost strobe-light effect:)
She checks for vital signs, pulse, heartbeat -- Miranda's
adrenaline at full tilt --MIRANDAC'mon, c'mon, c'mon --
She strikes the flint and brings the lighter to the
girl's pupils. Inspects them. Slaps her repeatedly,
clinically.
The strobe effect also allows us glimpses of the
immediate surroundings:   household tools strewn about;
wire cutters, pliers -- a pool of dried blood.MIRANDAWake up, Tracy, wake up --
Nothing. She unties the wires around the girl's ankles.
The skin swollen grotesquely around them. She shakes the
girl. Slowly coming to the realization that it's too
late.75.EXT. BARN - LATERMiranda comes crashing out of the barn, doubles over and
throws up. The bright light outside blinding her
momentarily. Her bloodshot eyes taking a moment to
register --THE PATROL CARparked in front of the house. A POLICE OFFICER

          husband will never forgive me if I
          get a ticket for trespassing.(CONTINUED)76.CONTINUED:The cop nods at that, seeming to have a fair grasp of

looking to see Tracy Seaver at the barn door. Dragging
herself in agony, clearly in a severe state of shock.

Chloe flinches at that. Like all this multitasking is
affecting her. She digs the gun deeper into the Sheriff's
neck, making him cower to his knees, execution style --CHLOELook -- let's not confuse things.

Miranda walks over and embraces her.       Chloe hands her the
gun.
And that's when the power returns.
Miranda and Chloe frozen in their embrace. Sheriff Ryan
on his knees. In the sudden, shocking glare of returning
light, color abruptly re-enters the world and every

the glow of the flashing red and blue lights from the
cruisers outside. The image a replica of the Andrea
White and Jenny Dixon visions.
Peeking from his half-unbuttoned shirt is the beginning
of a chest TATTOO. Miranda slowly trains the gun on the
Sheriff, finally struck with the realization:MIRANDAIt was you, wasn't it?SHERIFF RYANWhat are you talking about?
She opens his shirt to reveal the tattoo: a 1950s pinup-

He turns to look at her. A tense beat.PETE (O.S.)Miranda, don't do it!
She glances at Pete's pleading face and the room around
her: cops everywhere. All guns trained on her.
Sheriff Ryan speaks low so only she can hear the

Miranda's finger itches on the trigger as they face off.
Her hand starts to shake. Sheriff Ryan turns and strides
off. Getting away. Further. Further...
But as much as she wants to, she can't bring herself to
do it. Finally brings the gun down. The armed policemen
rush over and disarm her, shove her to the floor and cuff

shut it. Stares at her silently for a long while. And
so begins a claustrophobic cat and mouse game:SHERIFF RYANHow did you know?MIRANDAYou tell me.SHERIFF RYANThis isn't one of your word

you will. She eyes the open door. Tempted.SHERIFF RYANYou think me and Doug are

conversation. Analyst and patient in session.      Echoing
her opening scene with Chloe.MIRANDASo we're even. You left that door

          going to die, but truth is, Doug and

His demeanor and voice are eerily calm,    as if in a

             don't want to, but -- have you
             ever heard anything from -- ?
Pete shakes his head. Chloe nods, climbs inside the cab.
Pete waves as it drives off. Then he pulls out a postcard
from his pocket. It has a New York City postmark.115.INSERT - POSTCARDMIRANDA (V.O.)Dear Pete. Hope this finds you on
          both feet, preferably having been
          promoted to director after Phil's
          retirement. Not that you had much
          competition, but a big hug to you
          anyway... I was as surprised as
          anyone to read about Sheriff
          Ryan's suicide and the startling
          discovery that it was he who
          murdered my late husband. I wish
          I could personally thank certain
          people for their convincing
          testimonies in the case.NEWSPAPER HEADLINESfly AT us under her V.O.:
A) "Female doctor still at large, wanted for
questioning," with a picture of Miranda underneath.
B) "Guilt-ridden serial killer killed accomplice, then
killed self: Female Doctor cleared on charges."
Pictures of Sheriff Ryan and Douglas Grey side by side.
C) "Authorities close case on dual serial killers:
community mourns murdered daughters." A picture of
Officer Turlington, Pete, and Phil Parsons at a press
conference.MIRANDA (V.O.)As for myself, I have a new name
          now and a job working with teenage
          girls at a runaway shelter, trying
          to keep an open mind at the
          horrors they tell me...EXT. CEMETERY - DAYBOOM DOWN TO a young woman kneeling down to set flowers
on a grave and we recognize her as Tracy Seaver.
Shockingly cleaned up and properly attired -- she's even
cute.MIRANDA (V.O.)Which reminds me: Consuelo the
          Cuban witch is a keeper, don't
          fire her. She knows things about
          the world you and I don't.(CONTINUED)116.CONTINUED:PULL BACK to see the gave is Rachel's, and it is
positively overflowing with flowers. She's become
something of a cause celeb in these parts. Tracy walks
back to the retired couple holding hands, Phil and
Dorothy Parsons.MIRANDA (V.O.)Well, gotta run now, I have some
             country songs to write and lots of
             social invites to decline...
STILL PULLING BACK THROUGH the lush cemetery, PAST
several trees until we find Rachel watching the serene
scene. She turns TO CAMERA now and we PUSH INTO her
eyes, finally at peace, until it FILLS the SCREEN and in
it we see...EXT. BLEEKER STREET (NYC) - DAYMiranda walking among the throng of pedestrians. She
looks confident, relaxed, down to earth. No longer the
tightly wound professional at the beginning of our story.MIRANDA (V.O.)P.S. And in case you're wondering
             what the chances are of me buying
             you a beer and maybe finishing
             something we almost started, the
             answer is: it's just not going to
             happen. Especially not at
             McSorley's next Friday night. Say
             around nine. So you probably
             shouldn't bother showing up. All
             my love, M.G.
She turns at the light and gets lost in the crowd.FADE OUT.THE END
