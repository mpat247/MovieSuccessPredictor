               hides himself in an unlit Doctor's office. His face and chest 
               are covered in blood. He holds his forehead in pain.

               Andrea, wearing a mechanic's jumpsuit, works impatiently on 
               the carburetor of a Toyota Celica. Evan pets the dog as he 
               watches his mother work.ANDREAOkay, okay... what now?

               Evan quickly eyes the situation and grabs the 5/16" wrench

               Andrea hands the wrench to Evan.ANDREAHere, Ev... Finish this up for me.

               Evan beams as he climbs onto the bumper and screws the carb 
               back together.

               Andrea, meanwhile, strips off her coveralls, revealing a 
               spotless nurse's uniform underneath.EVANAll the dads are gonna be there.ANDREAI get the point, kiddo. But I'm not

               Andrea gets behind the wheel. She turns the ignition and the 
               engine roars to life. Evan wears a proud smile.ANDREAYou're amazing, kiddo.EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING - 1989Andrea races through the school zone and heads for the main 
               doors. Evan's already got the car door open and his foot on 
               the ground by the time the car skids to a halt. Andrea checks 
               her watch.ANDREAOkay have a great day I love you 
                         I'll pick you up later gotta go...

               Evan blows Andrea a kiss goodbye and runs into the school. 
               As Andrea pulls away, MRS. BOSWELL, 35, taps the car window.MRS. BOSWELLMrs. Treborn! I need to speak with

               Mrs. Boswell's morbid expression stops Andrea.MRS. BOSWELLI think you really need to see this.INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATERThe classroom is filled with screaming, running children. 
               Mrs. Boswell enters the classroom with Andrea and immediately 
               calls out to TOMMY, a tough seven-year old kid who swings a 
               whiffle bat at LENNY, now seven, a sniffling, chubby kid.MRS. BOSWELLTOMMY! LEAVE LENNY ALONE! DON'T MAKEME SEND YOU TO MR. VOYTEK'S OFFICE!Evan is surprised to see his mother enter with Mrs. Boswell, 
               but continues playing with Kayleigh, now seven, a quiet, 
               sweet-looking girl.

               Mrs. Boswell leads Andrea over to the teacher's desk.MRS. BOSWELLI was going to show this to the 
                         principal, but I wanted to talk to 
                         you first.ANDREAWhat is it?MRS. BOSWELLYesterday I had all the children 
                         draw pictures of what they wanted to 
                         be when they grew up. Most of them 
                         made drawings of what their parents 
                         did, but this...

               Mrs. Boswell opens the bottom drawer of her desk and pulls 
               out a drawing. Andrea turns to stone when she sees it.ANDREAI don't understand... Evan did this?

               The drawing shows a child holding a bloody knife while 
               standing on a heap of dead bodies. It's extremely 
               sophisticated for a seven-year old. Some of the corpses have 
               been cut open and the insides are surprisingly anatomically 
               correct.

               Andrea sees Evan playing with Lenny, harmless as a bunny, 
               and struggles to control her concern.ANDREAThank you for showing it to me first. 
                         I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I 
                         have the picture?MRS. BOSWELLOf course. There is one more thing, 
                         Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for 
                         mentioning it...ANDREAWhat?MRS. BOSWELLWhen I asked Evan about his drawing, 
                         well, he didn't remember doing it.

               Andrea is visibly shaken now.ANDREAI have to go.EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - LATERAndrea seems so impacted by this revelation that she cannot 
               even start the car.INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATERThe children hang artwork on the walls in prep for Parent's 
               Night. Each child has a picture of his or her family made 
               from colored construction paper and macaroni. Evan's picture 
               (no longer sophisticated) depicts his mother, Crockett and 
               himself on a green hill. Tommy and Kayleigh's pictures each 
               show two kids and a single father. And their 'mother' is 
               stuck to the far end of page.

               Lenny beams as he pins-up his picture of an ideal nuclear 
               family. He looks at Tommy's picture and is confused.LENNYYou put the mommy too far away. Mrs. 
                         Boswell has macaroni and glue if you 
                         wanna fix it.TOMMYYou're such a retard!KAYLEIGHMommy lives far away but she comes 
                         and visits.LENNY(to Tommy)
                         If I'm retarded, why didn't my mommy 
                         move away from me?

               Tommy gets upset. He swipes his hand down Lenny's picture 
               and his macaroni "mother" crumbles to the floor. Lenny begins 
               to cry.EVANHey, what'd you do that for?TOMMYFat little baby, crying for mommy.

               Evan takes the ruined picture and leans down next to Lenny.EVANCome on, Lenny. It's not that bad. 
                         You can still see your mom a little.

               Lenny, unable to stop crying, begins hyperventilating out of 
               control. His desperate gasps for breath are frightening.

               Evan, scared, looks around for Mrs. Boswell, but cannot find 
               her. He reaches up to his own picture and quickly tears his 
               own macaroni "mother" apart and places it over Lenny's 
               picture. It's a nuclear family again. Lenny slowly is able 
               to catch his breath.LENNY(grateful)
                         Can... can... Can I have this?EVANSure. I was gonna make a new one, 
                         anyway.

               Kayleigh helps Lenny glue a new "mother" in place and she 
               smiles gratefully at Evan.

               As Evan smiles back at Kayleigh, Mrs. Boswell calmly enters

               eleven ball off the rail. KRISTEN coolly smokes a cigarette, 
               confident that she and Heidi will hold the table.KRISTENSo... which one of you has a pet 
                         worm?

                         excitement gives me a heart attack.

               Evan speaks as he knocks the one-ball in the corner pocket. 
               As he talks, at a table behind them, some obnoxious Greeks, 
               including HUNTER, SPENCER, and GWEN make fun of Thumper.EVANIt's an experiment with flatworms 
                         and a maze. You take a flatworm and

                         memorized it. Then you put a new

               Thumper seems oblivious to their taunts as Evan knocks the 
               three-ball in the side.EVANYou chop up the smart flatworm and 
                         feed it to the dumb one and presto, 
                         the dumb one suddenly knows the maze 
                         inside and out.

               Evan walks past Heidi, putting his hand on her shoulder to 
               squeeze by. The hand lingers longer than necessary and Heidi 
               doesn't mind. He sinks another ball.EVANJust by absorbing the first worm 
                         into its cellular structure, it gets

               A handful of popcorn hits Thumper's face. They all try to

               Another barrage of popcorn hits Thumper's jacket. Although 
               his hand clenches on the cue. He meekly shuffles away to the 
               opposite side of the pool table from the cackling Greeks.HEIDI(intrigued)

               Thumper casually takes the pool cue from Evan.EVANNo, I just don't want to lose my 
                         mind.

               As Heidi digests this, Thumper carefully lines up his shot... 
               The eight ball.

               CRASH!!! The cue ball intentionally jumps the table, rocketing 
               into the pitcher of beer on the Greek's table. They're all 
               soaked with beer and debris.

               Just as they begin to rise, Thumper smashes the cue stick on 
               the table, WHISTLING innocently (while now brandishing a 
               spear). They sit the fuck down.

               Evan goes down. As Tommy prepares to bash his brains in, 
               Evan whips out the Pepper Spray and nails Tommy in the face.

               Tommy reels back in pain, covering his eyes with this free

               Evan rushes toward her and she stumbles backwards, still 
               terrified by his rage, and skitters away from him in a 
               crablike fashion.

               When done, he sneaks over to Mrs. Boswell's desk, where the

               against a wall above Thumper's head.EVANI'm not saying it again.

               Thumper and the co-ed quickly cover themselves in the blankets 
               and leave. Alone in the room, Evan looks under his bed and 
               breathes a sigh of relief to see all of his journals are 
               intact. He sifts through them again. He finally finds the 
               passage he needs. Something catches the corner of Evan's 
               eyes and he turns to examine it.

               Evan groans and shakes his head "no". He rides out the pain 
               like a seasoned pro.

               When it finally subsides, he lowers the pillow and smiles 
               feebly.EVANI'll think I'll be alright this time.

               Evan nods. They silently dump tons of journals into the fire.

                         Yeah, Ma. I'm running a little late 
                         for lunch. One of my patients had a 
                         breakdown. Anyway, order some soup 
                         in the meantime. See ya soon.

               As he clicks off, an attractive woman wearing a power suit 
               approaches from the other direction. Evan has to look closely, 
               but it's Kayleigh. A mature woman, now.

               He stumbles slightly, caught off guard. As she passes, her 
               eyes linger on his a little longer than necessary, but there's 
               no recognition. Evan watches her continue past him and down 
               the sidewalk.
