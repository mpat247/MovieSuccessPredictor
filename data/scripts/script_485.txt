     railroad tracks stitched onto the snowy landscape like a

     a retired policeman - regards the phone, both expecting
     and dreading the call. He picks up the receiver.MORELLWhat kind is it?VANGER O/SI don't know.

     to the silence from his end of the line in a wood-paneled
     room as baronial as the policeman's was spartan.VANGERI can't take it anymore.MORELL O/SI know. I'm sorry, Henrik.

     There's nothing more to say. Vanger sets the receiver
     down and regards a dried white flower in a 6" x 11" frame
     resting on the brown paper it was wrapped and mailed in.
     It's somehow ominous, like the dark storm clouds that now
     burst outside -2.2.4    INT. COURTHOUSE - STOCKHOLM - DAY                             4Mikael Blomkvist - 40's - regards the gauntlet of
     reporters he'll have to pass to get out of the building.
     As he strides toward them, microphones and cameras swing
     in his direction. Without stopping -BLOMKVISTWhat is this, the media event of the
               year?REPORTER 1Don't try to play it down, Mikael, it
               won't work.BLOMKVISTDon't try to play it up, that won't
               either.4A   EXT. COURTHOUSE - STOCKHOLM - DAY - CONTINUOUS            4AFeeling a bit like he's fleeing the scene of a crime,
     which in a way he is, Blomkvist steps outside opening his
     umbrella. A couple of the reporters come out after him -REPORTER 2Will you appeal?BLOMKVISTI'll appeal to you, Viggo:   Find a
               real story to cover.
     He hurries off in the rain.NEWSCASTER V/OFinancial journalist Mikael Blomkvist
               was found guilty today on 16 counts
               of aggravated libel against financier
               Hans-Erik Wennerstrom.5    INT. CAFE - STOCKHOLM - DAY                                   5At a table with a pre-made sandwich and cup of coffee,
     and a long court judgement, Blomkvist watches himself
     fleeing the reporters on the cafe's TV. He's the only
     one there who watches it - no one else is interested -
     which only makes it worse.3.3.TV NEWSCASTERIn an article published earlier
              this year, Blomkvist claimed
              Wennerstrom - founder and president
              of The Wennerstrom Group - used State
              funds intended for industrial
              development in Poland for an arms
              deal with the right-wing Ustashe in
              Croatia.

    The report cuts to a shot of Wennerstrom outside the
    courthouse in an Armani suit, surrounded by his legal
    team, confidently addressing the reporters -WENNERSTROM ON TVI have nothing against Mr.
              Blomkvist. He's a good journalist
              who I don't believe is guided by
              malice. But what he wrote was
              inaccurate, and inaccuracies can't go
              unanswered. He - all journalists -
              have to accept like the rest of us,
              actions have consequences.

    Done with his sandwich, Blomkvist goes to the counter.BLOMKVISTMarlboro Red ... and a lighter.6   EXT. CAFE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY                               6He comes out tamping the pack. Extracts a cigarette.
    Tosses the pack in a sidewalk trash bin. Flicks at the
    lighter but can't get it to fire in the wind and rain.
    Hunches his body around it, coaxes it to life.TV NEWSCASTER V/OBlomkvist was ordered to pay 600
              thousand SKE in damages and all court
              costs, which could be significantly
              more.

    He takes a long drag that dizzies him. A wonderful
    feeling. He regards the trash bin. Fishes around it,
    finds the pack, puts it in his coat pocket.7   EXT. MILLENNIUM OFFICES, STOCKHOLM - DAY - ESTABLISHING       78   INT. MILLENNIUM'S OFFICES - DAY                               8He comes through past Christmas decorations and a mostly-
    young staff. They try not to regard him as a dead-man-
    walking, but aren't entirely successful. He enters the

IKEA furniture - sends a mixed message: a feminist in a

     New Jersey crime family than CEO of a high-tech security
     firm, sits behind his desk, waiting with an older client.ARMANSKYIt's possible we could wait forever.FRODEYou called her, I thought.     You spoke
               to her.ARMANSKYI'm afraid that doesn't mean much.FRODEI don't understand.ARMANSKYNo one here likes her. So it's
               better if she works at home.FRODEBut you told her I wanted to meet
               her.ARMANSKYBut I've told her many more times I
               prefer her not to meet clients.11   INT. MILTON SECURITY - SAME TIME - DAY                    11The figure from the motorcycle crosses the lobby. From

     Armansky breathes a defeated sigh, taps the intercom
     button twice to say `okay, let her in.'

     Lisbeth Salander walks in: A small, pale, anorexic-
     looking waif in her early 20's. Short black-dyed hair -
     pierced eyelid - tattoo of a wasp on her neck; probably
     several more under her black leather jacket - black t-
     shirt, black jeans, black Caterpillar boots.

     Frode is only middlingly successful in concealing his
     initial reaction to her. This isn't punk fashion. This
     is someone saying, Stay the fuck away from me.ARMANSKYLisbeth, Mr. Dirch Frode.FRODEHow do you do?7.7.She doesn't shake Frode's hand, but does address him:SALANDERSomething wrong with the report?FRODENo. It seems quite thorough.
          There's a wealth of data here. But
          I'm also interested to know what's
          not in it.SALANDERThere's nothing not in it.FRODEYour opinion of him isn't.SALANDERI'm not paid to give my opinion.FRODESo you don't have one?

Salander sends Armansky a weary look. His look back
begs her not to say anything unpleasant. Eventually -SALANDERHe's clean.   In my opinion.FRODEHe's - excuse me?SALANDERHe's honest. He's who he presents
          himself to be. In his business,
          that's an asset.FRODEThere's less in his asset column
          after his conviction today.SALANDERThat's true. He made a fool of
          himself with that. If it happened
          that way.
Frode looks at Armansky.    What's that supposed to mean?SALANDERIf he made up the story, that's
          out of character. So is giving up
          without a fight. People don't do
          things that are out of character.FRODEAre you saying he was set up?8.8.SALANDERThat wasn't part of my assignment.

And, apparently, she has no opinion on it either.FRODEYou're quite right he made a fool of
          himself professionally. How big of a
          fool did he make of himself
          financially?SALANDERThe judgement will just about empty
          his savings.
This seems to please Frode more than anything else that
has been said, and Salander sees it.SALANDERMay I go?FRODEYour report is light in another
          area. His personal life. Anything
          you chose not to include?SALANDERNothing that warranted inclusion.FRODEI'm not sure if that means yes or no.ARMANSKYI think what Ms. Salander means, and
          I agree, is that everyone has a right
          to a certain amount of privacy, even
          when they're being investigated.FRODENot in this case. I have to know
          if there's anything about him I might
          find unsavory - even if she doesn't.

Armansky's look to her at once apologizes for Frode, and
encourages her to speak. She finally relents but puts no
more spin on it than any other piece of raw data -SALANDERHe's had a long sexual relationship
          with his co-editor. It wrecked his
          marriage, but not hers. Her husband
          accepts it. Sometimes she sleeps at
          Blomkvist's, sometimes at home.

Frode thinks about that, perhaps imagining how much
simpler his own life would be with such an arrangement.9.9.FRODEYou were right not to include that.SALANDERI know.FRODEAnything else?SALANDERNo.FRODEPlease think before you say no.SALANDERI did.FRODEI don't want to be surprised by
                something later.

      Salander offers nothing more.FRODESo. Nothing else. In the personal
                department. You're sure.SALANDER(pause)

      snapshots: his daughter, his sister, and one with Erika -
      in their 20's - in which he's wearing a black leather
      jacket.

      She wakes up alone in his bed. Pads to the darkened
      living room to find him typing on his laptop, a half-
      eaten sandwich and glass of water next to it.ERIKAUsually when I wake up in a cold

      a coffee and a gift haphazardly wrapped with a Christmas
      bow, the price tag still on it, a paperback book - My 60
      Memorable Games, by Bobby Fischer. She notices the price
      tag is still on it. Peels it off. Dials a call on her
      cell. Hangs up when it goes to voice mail.A18   EXT. PALMGREN'S APARTMENT - ESTABLISHING                 A1818    INT. PALMGREN'S APARTMENT - STOCKHOLM - DAY               18She knocks on a door. Hears classical music playing
      softly inside, but no one answers. She tries the door.
      It's unlocked. The gift in hand, she pushes it open.

      She comes into an apartment which looks like it could
      belong to a professor. Sees a chess piece on the floor.
      Then a trail of them that lead her to an overturned chess
      table and, next to it, a body.
      The gash on the old man's head could have been caused
      by a fall into the corner of the table, or from a blow to
      it. She quickly tries to determine if he's breathing.

      going on anywhere in the world. Standing around with
      eggnog are:11.11.Blomkvist; his teenage daughter Pernilla; his sister
Annika and her Italian husband; Erika and her weirdly
understanding artist husband Greger, whose arm is around
her waist; a few other friends (and perhaps lovers).GREGERYou needed a better attorney.       You

          good.ERIKAIt wasn't even about Mikael. It
          was Wennerstrom sending a message to
          the press as a whole - and the FSA:
          Don't ask questions.

Blomkvist's daughter seems concerned for him.BLOMKVISTI'm fine, Nilla. You don't have to
          worry about me.PERNILLAMom's worried.BLOMKVISTAbout me?PERNILLAAbout all that money.12.12.20   INT. SODER HOSPITAL - STOCKHOLM - NIGHT                     20Outside the ICU, Salander sits on the floor like a dog
     who won't leave the spot its master told it to wait. For
     the first time since we've met her, she looks vulnerable.
     The doors swing open. A doctor steps out. Salander gets
     up to hear his report -DOCTORYou're Mr. Palmgren's daughter?SALANDERHis ward.   He doesn't have a
                daughter.

     Palmgren, who is unaware of her, or the nurse attending
     him, or even himself. A spiderweb of tubes emerge from
     his neck and wrists; oxygen tubes from his nostrils.DOCTOR V/OHe's had severe cerebral
                hemorrhaging. Either from the
                fall itself, or a stroke that led to
                the fall. His blood pressure is
                still high. I'm hopeful he'll regain
                consciousness, but that's not
                assured. And it's possible, if he

She begins eating. Blomkvist stares at her, feeling a
little sick. A cell phone rings. No one can tell - as
you never can - whose it is, and so all pull them out.
It's Blomkvist's.BLOMKVISTExcuse me.
Looking back at his daughter with some concern, he steps
away to take the call.BLOMKVISTHello.FRODE O/SMr. Blomkvist?BLOMKVISTYes.FRODE O/SForgive me for intruding on your

      from outside a Mercedes. Unlike Blomkvist, he's dressed

      distant gunshot echoes, but neither Frode nor the old man

      moves across the dark room to a work table where high-end

      her a small homemade electronic box, which she turns over
      in her hands.

     call it cozy. In truth it's just tiny and freezing cold.

     Blomkvist unpacks. Puts clothes in a wardrobe, sets out
     books, note pads, pens, CD's, a CD player, his laptop and
     a small printer.29.29.He flips open his cell phone to make a call. Gets no
     reception bars. Hears a faint, plaintive cry and traces
     it to a window, beyond which, on the sill outside, stands
     a cat peering in. He opens the door, and the cat heads
     straight for the kitchenette. Then looks at him.BLOMKVISTWhat.   Milk?

     He opens the old fridge.    No milk.    Nothing.56   EXT. COTTAGE - DAY                                          56He comes out into falling snow holding his cell phone

     cradling the grocery bag, cell out in front of him again.
     Any of the locals could tell him he could do this forever
     - there are no cell towers anywhere around here.59   EXT. HEDESTAD - DUSK                                        59Grocery bag at his feet, he dials a call with fingers he
     can no longer feel on the gas station pay phone by the
     end of the bridge. It goes to Erika's voice mail.BLOMKVISTIt's me. I'm here. It's fucking
               cold and I'm on a pay phone. If you
               tried to call, the reception sucks,
               and if you tried to email, there's

     He hangs up, open the same pack of cigarettes from
     before. Eighteen in there. Struggles to get one lit in
     the wind and snow, hurries off toward the bridge.60   INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT                                        60As the cat laps at milk on a plate, Blomkvist tries to

     forgotten where he is, he regards the cat sleeping with
     him, then the room, and groans. He pads to the door in
     the freezing cold. Opens it to find a rugged older man
     on his doorstep with a handcart loaded with file boxes.NILSSONI'm Gunner.   The caretaker.65   INT. COTTAGE - LATER - DAWN                               65As Gunner expertly builds a fire in the fireplace for

     the estate. Smoke from chimneys rise into bitter cold
     grey skies, weather for which Blomkvist, unlike the old
     man, is inadequately dressed.VANGERThe island is owned by my family.
               Your closest neighbor is my brother
               Harald, another Nazi if you can

               detestable to put it nicely, but
               you'll probably never see him. He's
               a recluse.BLOMKVISTHe was there that day?VANGERIndeed he was.

     Vanger's look to Blomkvist adds, `so consider him a

For a moment, Vanger isn't sure what Blomkvist means.
Then he is, and is pleased by it.33.33.VANGERYes, you're right. The man who

      has written the names of the living Vanger family members
      and staff in the approximate locations of their houses.
      Next to it - 3x5 cards and photos - a Vanger family tree -
      which doubles as a suspects list. On some of the cards
      is the word, `deceased.'
      He makes a sandwich. Refills a coffee cup. Begins
      reading the police reports. The first is a photocopy
      of a note when the call from Vanger came in: "Officer

He lights the pipe.   Blomkvist watches the tobacco glow.BLOMKVISTI wanted to ask you about this.

He produces an old address book from his jacket pocket.
Of course, Morell has seen it before, and handles it
delicately. The decades have dried out its pages.37.37.Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZMORELLShe received this from Henrik the
          Christmas before. I studied it more

to that last page. On it, in neat handwriting:
Magda 32016 Sara 32109 R.J. 30114 R.L. 32027 Mari 32018MORELLThey're local Hedestad phone numbers.
          The first belonged to a woman named
          Margot, whose mother was Magda, who
          claimed she didn't know Harriet. The
          fourth, R.L., belonged to Rosemarie
          Larsson, an elderly woman who died a
          few years before. The other three
          were unconnected in any way that I
          could find.
He hands the address book back. It, and everything else
about the case, clearly trouble him still.BLOMKVISTI've reminded you of things you'd
          rather forget. I'm sorry.MORELLI can't forget it. It's my Rebecka
          Case.

Blomkvist isn't sure what that means.MORELLEvery policeman has at least one
          unsolved case. Back then it was old
          Torstensson. Year after year he kept
          returning to one - taking out the
          files - uselessly studying them. As
          young men, we had to laugh.BLOMKVISTWas this also a missing girl case?38.38.MORELLNo, that's not why I mention it.
               The Rebecka Case is something that
               happened before Harriet was born.
               I'm talking about the soul of a
               policeman. Poor Torstensson could
               never solve it, and could never let
               it go.

          began after my sister's death. It
          broke Henrik's entrepreneurial

innocently as possible -BLOMKVISTYou were here that day?MARTINEveryone was here, though I didn't

                 with that.

       He walks to the hallway. She doesn't. He holds out
       his hand. She finally joins him. As they step into the
       bedroom, he roughly pushes her toward the bed.SALANDERWait.

       She puts her backpack and leather jacket on a chair.
       Sits on the edge of the bed. He stands over her. She
       knows what she's supposed to do, but seems unable to.BJURMANIs there a problem?SALANDERI just want to know, am I going to

                 thing. Take my hand
       She reaches out to it and before she can react, there's
       a handcuff around the wrist. He quickly cuffs the other
       to his own wrist. This is bad. She tries to get out.
       He gets her in a strangle hold and chokes her into
       unconsciousness.100A   INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT                 100AShe comes to, on her stomach, sees her wrists cuffed to
       the headboard posts, her ankles secured to the foot posts
       with silk ties, and scissors slicing her jeans off. She
       starts to scream and he stuffs her mouth with her
       underwear.BJURMANPlease.   I have neighbors.

       He lights a couple candles.   Switches on some New Age
       music.BJURMANWhat we're going to do now is teach
                 you the value of money.

                 you liked anal sex?

       He crams a pillow under her stomach and climbs on top
       of her. She keeps fighting but there's not much she can
       do handcuffed. Eventually, she retreats to another place
       inside herself. She's had to go here before in her life;
       it's the only place to go in such situations.101    INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT                                       101The cat turns its head to a sound Blomkvist can't hear.
       He has Harriet's box of belongings out again and looks at
       photos of her school friends in her wallet. Then picks
       up the Bible. Handwritten on the inside cover is Harriet
       Vanger. He opens it at random. Hebrews:HARRIET V/OFaith is the assurance of things
                 hoped for, the evidence of things not
                 seen. Through faith we understand
                 that the world was created by the
                 word of God - and that what is seen
                 was not made of things that are
                 visible ...

      on a blurry one of the fire crew, the focus inadvertently
      on the background - Vanger's manor.

      What caught his attention is a figure in one of the
      upstairs windows. He checks a scribbled floor plan of
      the manor and sees that it's Harriet's bedroom.

      But he's not sure if it's Harriet. The figure is too
      soft to identify - even with a magnifying glass - but is
      wearing a light-colored dress and has light hair.
      He glances to the family tree on the wall - the teenage
      Vanger girls' photos -

      Three INSERTS:   Harriet ... Cecelia ... Anita ...

      They all have light hair, and, frankly, all look alike.

      He moves on to the parade pictures. To the one Vanger
      said before was the last picture taken of Harriet alive.
      It's not really of her.64.64.It's a wide shot of the parade itself - but she can be
      seen in the background across the street with her
      friends, watching a float - atop which some women in
      harem outfits dance - pass by.
      He slips it from its corner-fasteners and turns it over.
      There's a Hedestad Courier copyright printed on the back.
      He turns it over again and looks at the photo itself.117   EXT. HEDESTAD - DAY                                      117Guided by the photo, he walks along the town's main
      street to the approximate place from which it was taken -
      outside a haberdashery window - but it's still not right.
      The photo was shot from a higher than street level angle.
      He looks to a second story window above the store. Then
      crosses the street to where Harriet was standing when the
      picture was taken. Looks back at the haberdashery where,
      now, the owner peers out at him.118   EXT. HEDESTAD - LATER - DAY                              118On the pay phone outside the gas station -BLOMKVISTI want to look at what the paper

      sound neither we nor Blomkvist can hear, and stays
      absolutely still, listening.

      Blomkvist scrolls through the Courier negatives he has
      converted into positives and has loaded into Photoshop.
      He was right. Many more parade pictures were shot that
      day. Several at street level - a marching band, floats,
      children with balloons, some in better focus than others.
      He reaches the first of the higher-angle shots from the
      floor above the haberdashery, scans the crowd lining the
      street. Harriet isn't in it.

      But in the next she appears at the edge of the frame
      with her school friends. In the next, she's further into
      frame. And the next, standing in the same spot he stood
      earlier today.124   OMIT - INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT           12467.67.125   INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT                                     125Blomkvist selects all 18 of the high-angle parade
      photographs, transfers them to an iPhoto file, and
      reopens them as a `slide show.'
      The first few, accompanied by the default music, Minuet
      in G, dissolve at two-second intervals. Too long. Too
      distracting with the music. And too wide.
      He adjusts the size function - closer on Harriet gets
      rid of the dissolve effect and music and reduces the time-
      interval to make the transitions as quick as possible.

      He hits `play' again and watches a short jerky `silent
      film'- a kind of electronic flip-book:

      Harriet arrives with her friends. Moves along the
      street. Stops and faces the parade. Says something to
      her friends. Laughs. Watches the float with the harem
      girls on it. Smiles. Sees something to her left. Turns
      her head slightly toward it. Her eyes widen in fear.
      She looks down. She moves off. Her friends look after
      her confused. And then she's gone.
      Blomkvist backs up to the frame of Harriet looking off
      with fear in her eyes, and for the first time believes
      without a doubt what Vanger has believed for 40 years:

      She was murdered. Whoever she saw across the street
      followed her and killed her. The cat watches him.126   INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                         126Bjurman slowly comes to.SALANDERGood.   You're alive.

      It takes him a moment to realize it's true. Another to
      realize it might be better if he wasn't since he's naked
      on the floor, face-up, wrists and ankles bound. He tries
      to cry out and realizes he's also gagged.

      She emerges from the shadows, stands over him, and he
      sees that her eyes are ringed in black mascara like some
      kind of ghoulish raccoon. She looks insane. As she
      steps out of his field of view, and his hands struggle
      against the restraints.SALANDERRecognize this?

      He cranes his neck to see she's by her backpack that's
      resting on a chair.68.68.SALANDERI had it with me last time. I set
          it here. Remember?
               (he doesn't)
          See this snap? It's not a snap.
          It's a wide-angle micro-lens.

She takes a DVD-R from the backpack, puts it in his
player, flips his plasma TV on with a remote. She got it
all - what he did to her - the rape - in HD.SALANDERThis shows you sodomizing a mentally
          impaired girl. If it's ever seen
          outside this room, who'll be
          institutionalized then?

He starts to whimper.SALANDERHere's what's going to happen.
          Pay attention.

He can't. He can't even look at her. His life is over. He
weeps into the gag.SALANDERLook at me.

He won't. She strides to her backpack. Takes out a
large dildo. Gets on her knees, and works it into his
ass. She can only get it about halfway up. She has to
stand up and kick it the rest of the way with her boot.
He howls into the gag.SALANDERDo I have your attention now?

She does indeed. He vigorously nods his head, now, and
after everything she says -SALANDERWhen you can walk again, which I
          admit could be a while, we're going
          to my bank. You'll tell them I alone
          have access to my account. After
          that, you'll never contact me again.
          Each month you'll write a report of a
          meeting we won't have. You'll
          describe how well I'm doing, how
          sociable I'm becoming. Then you'll
          negotiate with the court to have my
          declaration of incompetence lifted.
          If you fail, this video will spread
          across the Internet like a virus.

          I get hit by a car - if you hit me

          automatically.
She fishes his apartment keys from his trousers. Shows
him that she has them.SALANDERI'm taking these with me. I'll
          be checking on you. If I ever
          find anyone in here with you,
          whether she came of her own free
          will or not -
His eyes dart to the TV as he nods that he understands.SALANDERNo.   Not the video.

She kicks him. Then straddles his fat gut and looks him
in the eye.SALANDERI will kill you.
And he knows she means it.SALANDERDo you doubt anything I've said?
               (he shakes his head no)
          Do you doubt what's in the reports
          about me? What do they say when
          you sum them up? They say I'm
          insane.
               (he shakes his head no)
          No, it okay. You can nod because
          it's true. I am insane.

She gets up off him, rummages through her backpack again.SALANDERI know it'll be hard for you to abide
          by my rules. Especially no more sex.
          I'm going to make it easier for you.
She puts on a plastic surgical mask. He fears the next
thing he'll see is a pair of scissors in her hand, but it
isn't. It's something else he doesn't recognize. She
straddles him again. He squirms under her weight.SALANDERLie still.   I've never done this
          before.70.70.He sees that the thing in her hand is some kind of
       surgical device, a shiny stripped-down gun with a sharp
       point and a plastic ink bottle where the bullets would
       go.SALANDERThere will be some blood.
       He struggles to twist his body away, but it's useless.
       She digs the tattooing gun's needle into his chest and
       begins dragging it back and forth. He screams as dots
       of blood spatter her plastic mask ...A127   EXT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - DAWN - ESTABLISHING           A127127    INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - DAWN                           127The job has taken her all night. The sky outside the
       living room window is beginning to lighten. She drinks a
       glass of water in the kitchen, wipes her prints from it.

       She crosses to the bedroom where Bjurman's toys have
       been wiped cleaned and put back in the dresser. Picks up
       her backpack. Looks at him. He's unconscious. She sets
       handcuff key next to a dark stain on his stomach.

       We stay on the key as she leaves the room. Hearing the
       front door open and close, we rise up to see his entire
       naked body on the bed. Tattooed into his skin in big
       letters, from his nipples to his groin, is:I AM A RAPIST PIG128    OMIT:   EXT. HEDESTAD - DAWN                              128129    OMIT:   INT.

       sitting outside the cottage, petting his cat - Harriet.
       Of course it can't be her, but it is a teenage girl who
       resembles the old pictures of her. Seeing him, she
       waves. It's his daughter.PERNILLAHi.BLOMKVISTHi.   What are you doing here?PERNILLAOn my way to Skelleftea.    I can only

       smiles bravely.PERNILLAThey're not dangerous.BLOMKVISTIt's fine, Nilla. Whatever you

       As they eat in silence, Blomkvist can't help but think
       about Harriet and what Vanger said about not giving her
       his attention when she needed it.BLOMKVISTI'm not around enough to know
                 everything that's going on with you,

      The train clears the platform. He watches after it.
      What was she talking about? He glances absently to the
      taxi stand. Hussein points to his taxi. Ride?130   INT. COTTAGE - LATER - DAY                              130Blomkvist comes in, goes straight to his desk, sifts
      through the paperwork on it, then sees the Xerox of the
      last page of Harriet's address book - the unknown phone
      numbers - he taped to the lamp -

      It could be a coincidence they're Bible names -
      Magdalene, Sarah, Mary - or maybe not. He digs through
      Harriet's personal things for her Bible.
      Since all the number sequences begin with `3,' he goes
      to the third chapter - Leviticus - notices that its first
      facing page is faintly dog-eared - finds R.J's verse -
      1:14 - on it:HARRIET V/OIf a dove is the sinner's offering,
                the priest shall wring off its head,
                cleave its wings, and burn it upon

      numbers on his cell phone. Instead of ringing he hears a
      beep. "Retry?" appears on the cell screen.132   EXT. HEDESTAD - DAY                                        132Back across the bridge by the gas station, he makes the
      call on the pay phone.BLOMKVISTDetective Morell, it's Mikael
                Blomkvist.MORELL O/SHow are you? Not still in Hedestad I

                have to do with anything?BLOMKVISTNothing probably.

      As Blomkvist glances to the last page in Harriet's
      address book, to R.J. 30114 -MORELL O/SJacobsson.   Rebecka Jacobsson.BLOMKVISTHow was she killed?MORELL O/SDecapitated.   Arms cut off.    Burned.

      Like the Leviticus dove. A siren.      Ambulance coming
      past, headed for the bridge.MORELL O/SBut this happened in the 1940's -BLOMKVISTHang on a second.

      He watches the ambulance speed across the bridge.74.74.BLOMKVISTI'm going to call you back.MORELL O/SWhat have you (found) -
      Blomkvist hangs up and takes off at a trot toward the
      bridge -133   EXT. VANGER MANOR - LATER                                 133He reaches the manor just as the ambulance is leaving
      and Martin is climbing into his Range Rover. He looks
      undone.BLOMKVISTWhat's happened?MARTINWe were talking. He started
                rubbing at his arm. Then collapsed.BLOMKVISTIs he (conscious) -MARTINI can't talk, Mikael, I have to (go) -BLOMKVISTGo.

      Martin pulls out to follow the ambulance to the hospital.
      Blomkvist watches after them.134   INT. COTTAGE - EVENING                                    134The cat naps while Blomkvist looks up the other Leviticus
      quotes from Harriet's list in her dog-eared Bible -HARRIET V/OThe daughter of any priest who
                profanes herself by playing the
                harlot, profanes her father, and

                shall be put to death by stoning -

      There's a knock. He tucks the list in the Bible, sets
      aside and answers the door. Frode comes in.FRODEThe good news is he survived. How
                he does now, we have to see. He's in
                ICU. Can I have one of those?75.75.He points to the table.BLOMKVISTA sandwich?FRODEA Scotch.
Blomkvist pours him one, and another for himself.BLOMKVISTI don't want to be indelicate. But
           Henrik promised me something when I
           agreed to do this.FRODEWennerstrom.BLOMKVIST(nods)
           I need to know what he has on him.

           you're asking me. And he can't tell
           you in the condition he's in. So ...
           is that it then?
Silence.   Blomkvist drinks.   Eventually -BLOMKVISTWe also never discussed who I'd
           report to if something happened to
           him.FRODEYou'd report to me, but does it
           matter? We both know nothing's going
           to come of this.BLOMKVISTI'm not so sure.

Frode looks at Blomkvist a little more intently.FRODEWhat do you mean?76.76.BLOMKVISTI may have found something.FRODE(pause)
          You're joking.
               (Blomkvist isn't)
          What did you find?
Now it's Blomkvist who studies Frode. He's not sure he
wants to tell him. And even less so the longer he looks.BLOMKVISTThe last time I reported something
          before I was sure of it, it cost me
          my savings.

Frode studies him again - wondering perhaps if Blomkvist
suspects him.BLOMKVISTI need a research assistant.     Can you
          authorize that?FRODEYes.   Do you have one?BLOMKVISTI can find one.FRODEI know a good one. She did the
          background check on you.BLOMKVISTThe.FRODEDo you think we'd hire anyone for

pausing at its darker recesses. Frode nods.FRODEYes, it was quite thorough.BLOMKVISTI want to read it.FRODEThat I couldn't authorize.77.77.Blomkvist isn't sure how to play this. Then he is.
      Sets his napkin down, gets up and begins taking things
      down from the wall. Frode watches. Then sighs.135   EXT. STOCKHOLM - DUSK                                    135Only a few lights on in the Milton Security building.136   INT. ARMANSKY'S OFFICE - DUSK                            136It isn't often a subject of an investigation shows up in

      Silence.   Armansky tries not to look sick.    Then -78.78.ARMANSKYThe reason you can find no record of
                her is because her records have been

      at a table drinking, Salander seems comfortable with the
      noise and her dateless status, but doesn't avoid a glance
      from an Asian girl at the bar, and doesn't tell her to go
      away when she comes over and motions to the empty chair.138   INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - MORNING                       138Salander and the girl from the club, asleep in bed,

      Salander wakes, disentangles herself, and is padding to
      the bathroom when there's a knock on her door.
      She stares it. No one ever knocks on her door. But
      someone knocks on it again. She crosses to it, wrapping
      herself in a blanket.SALANDERWho is it?BLOMKVIST O/SMikael Blomkvist.
      Her mind races, as Blomkvist's did to the news someone
      had invaded his privacy. She unlocks the door. Cracks
      it enough to see him. He smiles, but it's disconcerting.
      She's not sure it's a harmless one.BLOMKVISTMay I come in?SALANDERActually I'm not really up (yet) -BLOMKVISTThat's okay.79.79.He pushes the door enough to pass. Has a paper bag and
      satchel with him. Takes in the place, including the girl
      in the bedroom, in a glance as he heads for the kitchen.BLOMKVISTI assumed you wouldn't have had
                breakfast yet so I brought some bagel

      girlfriend lets herself out. In the bedroom, Salander
      finishes getting dressed, sticks her Taser in the back
      pocket of her jeans and comes out to find a table setting
      that's more formal than she, or anyone who lives alone,
      is used to.BLOMKVISTYou're awake.    Good. Breakfast is
                ready.

                on an island?

      Salander, as we know, is not paid to give her opinion.
      She's a hunter/gatherer, not an analyst. But Blomkvist
      asked, so she gives it -SALANDERShe was looking for him, too.167   OMIT - INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT                             16793.93.168   EXT. COTTAGE - LATER - NIGHT                             168The silence they just left has followed them out here.

       wearing a leather jacket not unlike Salander's.BLOMKVIST O/SWhat are you doing?

       He's just woken up in a tangle of blankets on the couch
       to see her at his laptop. She closes the album, leaving
       on the screen what she was looking at before: his iMovie
       of the parade and some annotated police files.SALANDERGoing over your notes.BLOMKVISTThey're encrypted.

          from the parade photos.BLOMKVISTThank you.SALANDERToo bad you don't have hers.BLOMKVISTWhose.

She doesn't say. He comes over. She plays the iMovie,
stops on a frame before Harriet turns her head. Points
to a young couple standing among the people behind her.
The woman has an Instamatic camera in her hand.SALANDERHer.

She advances to the next frame:    The woman has raised
the camera to her eye.

And the next: Harriet turning her head in foreground
while in the background the flash cube atop the woman's
Instamatic flares slightly.

Blomkvist is stunned, by both the fact he didn't notice
it before, and what it means: Though the woman is taking
a snapshot of the parade, she could have inadvertently
included in it whatever - whoever - Harriet saw at that
moment across the street.BLOMKVISTExcuse me.

He takes over his laptop from her, finds the later
Courier photos he didn't include in his iMovie, after
Harriet has left.

In one, the couple is moving off the other way. In
another, they're getting in a parked car to leave.
He sharpens the Photoshop contrast. The rear license
plate is partly visible, but too small for him to make
out even by squinting.BLOMKVISTCan you read that?SALANDERA, C, Three - the rest is blocked.96.96.He focuses on a decal on the car's back window. The

       He gets up. Heads for the front door to smoke his
       cigarette outside -BLOMKVIST (ADR)I'm going to have to go to Norsjo.

       He opens the door to leave and sees on the porch -
       The charred corpse of the cat. Its legs - sawn off and
       arranged in the shape of a swastika - lie in the middle
       of a dark circle of blood.

       He seems too startled to move, but when Salander sees
       it, she immediately gets her camera and begins framing
       close-ups of the cat parts, and its head resting atop
       the seat of her motorcycle.

      people.
      It's too blurry to make out his face or age, but he has
      light brown hair, dark slacks, and a dark blazer with
      some kind of patch on the pocket.184   EXT. STOCKHOLM - LATE AFTERNOON                           184Salander blasts onto the highway headed north.185   INT COTTAGE - AFTERNOON                                   185Blomkvist regards Isabella's two photos on the wall.
      In one she's a stunning young woman.    In the other, the
      old wreck she's become.
      He glances to her husband Gottfried's photo. Where a
      second more current photo of him should go is a Courier
      article about his drowning in 1965. That's when Isabella
      changed - and this is where it happened - in this old
      house out on the point.

      He untacks the article -103.103.186   EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - LATE AFTERNOON                       186The boathouse   hasn't fared well. Neither has the dock

      no boat, just   dark water slapping against the pilings -
      looks back to   the shore at the long-uninhabited cabin.187   INT. CABIN - LATER - LATE AFTERNOON                       187No electricity but enough light spills through the open
      door for him to see the neglected, shadowy interior:

      Beds with bare, or no, mattresses. Sticks of furniture.
      Old water-stained books strewn around. Beer bottles and
      other debris left by intrepid Hedestad teenagers.
      It's creepy, even if you weren't alone in it, knowing
      what you know.

      He kneels to look at some of the books. Mickey Spillane,
      a bird guidebook, something called The Evil Empire about
      the USSR, a children's book. He opens this last one and
      sees "Harriet" scrawled in a very young child's hand.188   EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - LATE AFTERNOON                       188Having climbed the cliff above the cabin, he finds
      himself at the highest point on the island. Stops to
      rest at the ruins of a fort.

      A piece of the stone wall next to his head suddenly
      erupts. As fragments tear into his scalp, he hears the
      delayed crack and echo of the rifle shot -

      He throws himself to the ground. Crawls desperately
      around and behind the ruins. Sees his shirt is bloody
      but can't feel a wound under it. Touches his face and
      finds the blood is coming from his forehead.
      He can see no one, and is almost relieved since if he
      could it would mean they were walking toward him, which
      would mean he would soon be shot dead, point blank.
      He has to get out of here before that happens. Behind
      him - the rocky cliff he just climbed. Ahead of him - a
      clearing leading to woods. Really only one choice -

      He runs for the trees. Dives through a curtain of
      thicket and stinging nettles that tear at his arms and
      hands. Crawls the rest of the way to the woods on his
      elbows and toes like an infantryman.

      Safe for the moment, he figures, hidden in the woods, he
      looks at the sun low in the sky, and decides to wait.104.104.189   INT/EXT. COTTAGE - EVENING                                189Salander, returned from Stockholm, moves around the

       It takes all he's got not to move, and even that isn't
       enough as she first sticks the needle through the flesh.
       He pulls away with a groan.

       She just looks at him. Waits for him to take another swig
       of vodka to steel himself.
       She pierces him a second time, draws the floss through
       the skin. And after that it doesn't seem to be so bad.
       As she works, his eyes glance to hers with a mixture of
       dread and gratitude, but hers are focused on the work.
       Hers then briefly glance to his, but now his are down.192A   INT. COTTAGE - A FEW MINUTES LATER - NIGHT               192AHe comes out of the bathroom in his soaking wet pants and

       vigilant more for his sake than her own.

       She goes to a window and looks out. Sees her own
       reflection in the glass and studies it. Then kicks her
       boots off.193    INT. COTTAGE - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT                        193She comes into the bedroom in her t-shirt and underwear.

                  It's insane ... these people are
                  insane ...SALANDERNo one's shooting at you now.

       She pulls her t-shirt over his stitched-up head,
       cocooning it against her breasts. Silence. Then -BLOMKVISTI'm pretty sure this isn't a good
                  idea.SALANDERWhy.

       Lights one. Glances over to him lying next to her. He's
       not looking at the smoke but rather the startling tattoos
       on her bare legs and arms. Eventually -SALANDERYou want me to open a window?

       He shakes his head no. Reaches for the cigarette.        Takes
       a drag. Hands it back.195    INT. COTTAGE - MORNING                                     195He wakes. Comes out to find a proper place setting on

       but not altogether unpleasant silence you always hear in
       this situation the next morning. She breaks it -SALANDERI like working with you.BLOMKVISTI like working with you, too.196    OMIT - INT.

      This goes against every privileged, confidential bone
      in the lawyer's body. He can only stare at Blomkvist and
      Salander across the room, wondering why he hired either
      one of them.197   EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - LATER - DAY                         197Blomkvist and Salander walk down the road from Martin's

       scrolling through the bridge accident shots -
       He stops. One of the figures has something in his hand
       he hadn't noticed before. It and the figure are somewhat
       blurred in movement - but it looks like a gun. He
       sharpens the contrast to reveal that the gun is in fact a
       Hasselblad-type camera. Looks at the man's face - then
       at his wall of Vanger family photos - unhappy to see it

      step-stool. Pulls a couple of large binders from a high

      some of Harald's dearer photographs - some photographs in
      dusty frames.

      next to Rebecka Jacobsson, 1949, Hedestad - moves on to

      bad, but the rabbit-print tea cozy only makes it worse.
      Blomkvist tries to ignore him settling back in his worn
      leather chair with his chipped cup, and sifts through an
      old shoebox of unsorted photographs:

      A holiday at Lake Como, early 1950's judging from the
      cars; a Vanger family gathering long ago; some men posing
      by a slain wild boar dangling from a rope.

      Harald holds out a pack of cigarettes.     Blomkvist comes
      over, pulls one out.HARALDBlom ... kvist ...

                With an `o' - or a `u.'BLOMKVIST`o.'HARALDAn `o.'   Blom - kvist.

      Harald doesn't say it, but his nod means, `not Jewish
      then. Good' Blomkvist returns to the photos, glancing
      up occasionally to the smoke curling up past Harald's
      face as he examines the journalist at work.HARALDI'm not a recluse. I don't close

      Blomkvist opens another shoebox. Lying on top is a
      photograph of the bridge accident, and, under it, a few
      more. He takes them out and angles them toward a lamp.114.114.HARALDTwo point eight.BLOMKVISTPardon me?HARALDThe Zeiss Tessar on my Hasselblad.
                Excellent lens.

      Blomkvist tries to nod appreciatively, but the bridge
      photos don't tell him anything he doesn't already know.

      He finds several more that appear to be a hunting
      expedition - men and blood hounds - but then sees Morell
      in one, more policemen, and a stricken Henrik in boots
      and raincoat, and realizes this is the search party. Off
      to the side, a young man, head turned half away, wearing
      a dark blazer with a gold patch, which that 2.8 Zeiss
      lens makes clear is a prep school insignia. A lion.HARALDLandscape?   Some nice landscapes

      glance at it a moment to recognize his late nephew's son:HARALDThat's Gottfried's boy.BLOMKVISTMartin?

      The woman leaves. Her footsteps echo and fade. Salander
      reads a yellowed clipping from a Landskrona newspaper:116.116.It's about Vanger Industries hiring a local contractor,
      Carlen Construction, to build a plant. Gottfried Vanger -
      here to sign the contract.

      But all that really interests Salander is the date. The
      article was published one day after the paper printed the
      story of the discovery of Rakel's battered naked body.

      Salander flips through the handwritten notes she made
      during her talk with the retired detective in Landskrona -
      and finds that part-time palm reader Rakel's main job was
      as a cleaning woman for Carlen Construction.



      The detective interviewed her co-workers, but no one from
      Vanger Industries, including that firm's representative
      in town for a few days, Gottfried Vanger.

      She regards Gottfried's newsprint photo: His face looks
      more than 8 years older than the one in Kalmar but that's
      what drinking to excess, and murder perhaps, does to you.214   INT. COTTAGE - EVENING                                     214Blomkvist lays the Lena Andersson article - and the
      photograph of the figure at the parade - atop the rest of
      the junk on the desk - and quickly scrolls through photos
      on his laptop, leaving on the screen for Salander to see
      when she returns: Martin's recent Vanger Industries PR
      portrait ...118.118.215   INT. ARCHIVES - NIGHT                                     215Salander has hit a snag. Gets up. We stay to have a
      look at the problem she leaves: the victims list - now
      with "Gottfried" jotted down next to all but one name:
      1967 - Lena Andersson - Uppsala

      Next to it, the newspaper article about the murdered
      girl, with a school photo. And, next to that, the reason
      there's no "Gottfried" notation: his obituary in a
      Hedestad Courier clipping: 1965.
      We listen to the fading echo of Salander's footsteps -216   INT. ARCHIVES - SAME TIME - NIGHT                         216As annoying as the older woman was, it was less creepy
      with her around. Salander is alone in the old building
      now, wandering through it looking for vending machines.

      She finds some. Drops coins in one. A cup fills with
      coffee. She gets a candy bar from another. The coffee
      machine finishes. The place again plunges into silence.
      She starts back with her snack down a hallway -217   EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - NIGHT                                217Trying to look like he's just out for a stroll,
      Blomkvist walks past Martin's dark house, then turns
      around, walks up the front path to the porch and makes a
      show of knocking on the door, just in case anyone on the
      island can see him, which is doubtful in this darkness.
      He tries the door. Locked. Comes down off the porch as
      if leaving, but then veers off the path and walks around
      to the side of the house.

      He peers through a floor-to-ceiling window, but can't
      see much inside. Comes around to the back and looks in
      another window. Tries the back door. Unlocked.218   INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS                          218He can't see a lot in the dark, but doesn't dare switch
      on any lights. He crosses through the kitchen, but we
      stay behind to regard a closed basement door ...

      We pick him up again as he comes into the living room,
      follow him to a wall of glass. It's pitch black outside.

      We follow him down a hallway - but stop at a bedroom
      doorway as if this is as far as we care to go. We stay
      at the threshold and watch him go in and look around. As
      he begins rummaging around the recesses of a closet -119.119.218A   EXT. THE BRIDGE - NIGHT                                 218AA pair of headlights comes across the bridge.218B   INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT                             218BBlomkvist comes back to the wall of glass. Still no
       lights out there. Heads off to the hall again.218C   EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - NIGHT                              218CThe car parks fifty yards from Blomkvist's cottage.   The
       headlights blink off. Someone climbs out.218D   INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT                             218DBlomkvist comes into a study. Lots of books and framed
       photographs. He begins looking around.218E   EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - NIGHT                              218EThe headlights come up the road leading to the point.218F   INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT                             218FBlomkvist approaches a gun case in the study. Hunting
       rifles. Three of them - and an empty space for a fourth
       one.

       The trees outside the study window flare with light. A
       moment later, Blomkvist hears a sound of tires on gravel.
       Martin is back, and Blomkvist is in his house.

       We rush back down the hall with Blomkvist. Hopefully
       Martin will enter through the front door because we're
       going to try to get out the back one -

       Blomkvist trips over something in the dark and we go down
       with him. Then up again - through the kitchen - past the
       basement door - grabs a knife from a drawer - shoves it
       in a back pocket - hurries out the rear door -219    EXT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS                         219Blomkvist tries to steady his breathing as he slinks
       around the side of the house. As he passes a window, it
       lights up - and we again hit the ground with him.
       He hurries across the yard, trips over something in the
       dark - a sprinkler? - and goes down again into wet muck.

       He gets up and starts down the road as if returning from
       a leisurely evening walk - which would be more convincing
       without the limp - not daring to look back as he goes.120.120.MARTIN O/SHello?   Mikael?

      Blomkvist stops. His heart pounds.      Martin comes down
      his porch and walks toward his car.MARTINYour evening stroll?BLOMKVISTHi.   How are you?

      Martin pulls a golf bag from his trunk and shoulders it.MARTINI stopped at the hospital on my way
                home. Henrik asked me to ask you
                something.BLOMKVISTWhat.MARTINCome on in, I'll make you a drink.

      Naturally, this is the last thing Blomkvist wants to do,
      but it would be more suspicious if he refuses. He heads
      back to Martin's house, trying not to limp.220   INT. ARCHIVES - NIGHT                                       220Finished with her candy bar and coffee, Salander opens
      the 1967 files, looks through the clippings for anything
      of note in Uppsala, where Lena was killed.

      She finds no news of factories opening there that year,
      but she does come across a PR newsletter about a winter
      retreat for fifty employees and their families.

      There's a photo of Henrik presenting someone with a Best
      Worker of the Year plaque. And another taken at a dinner
      for twenty guests and Vanger family members:
      The camera has captured Henrik presiding at the head of
      the table, putting on a brave face, raising a champagne
      flute - as everyone else does the same - except for the
      young man at the far right foreground.

      He looks sullen. But what teenager wouldn't at an event
      as boring as this. Salander would look even more sullen.
      She checks the caption and reads:

      ... far right, Martin Vanger (19), currently studying in
      Uppsala.121.121.Uppsala. Same place as Lena - though it's what young
      Martin is wearing that strikes her: an Uppsala private
      school blazer with a lion on its pocket - the same as on
      Lena Andersson's sweater in the photo of her in the
      article about her murder.221   INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT                              221It's not as eerie with the lights on - except for the
      fact there's a killer in it. Martin sets the golf clubs
      down and begins emptying a grocery bag in the kitchen.MARTINWhat happened to you?BLOMKVISTWhen.MARTINNow.

                give you one.BLOMKVISTI just wasn't being careful.

      Martin smiles, but Blomkvist isn't sure what he said
      warrants one. Martin begins rummaging through a drawer
      for a flashlight. The knife block - with one missing -
      is right there.MARTINHow's the investigation?BLOMKVISTNothing new to report.

      Blomkvist notices a drop of blood from his pantleg on
      the stone floor and covers it up with his shoe. Martin,
      not seeming to notice, finds a mini-Maglite in the
      drawer.MARTINDirch says Ms. Salander is clever.

      parade taken by the Brannlund woman on her honeymoon; the
      people across the street and the blurry figure wearing
      the blazer with the "pocket square" ...SALANDERHello, Martin.223   INT. MARTIN'S KITCHEN - LATER                             223Martin pours Scotch.    Hands one to Blomkvist.BLOMKVISTWhat did he say?MARTINWhat?BLOMKVISTYou said Henrik asked you to ask me

                was his question.BLOMKVISTOh.

      Blomkvist's eyes only dart to a rifle bag leaning against
      the wall next to a box of shells, but Martin follows
      them.MARTINYou hunt? We should go hunting
                together sometime.BLOMKVISTSure.

      They drink.   Listen to a silence.123.123.MARTINNothing at all?

                what he means)
          New. To report.BLOMKVISTNo.
Martin regards Blomkvist in another silence.        Then -MARTINI can see you're anxious.BLOMKVISTNo.MARTINTo get home.    After your walk.BLOMKVISTI suppose I am.MARTINTo have dinner. With your
          girlfriend.BLOMKVISTMy assistant.    Yes.MARTINWe'll have better luck with a gun.BLOMKVISTSorry?MARTINWhen we go hunting.

Martin pulls open a bar drawer and takes from it a
handgun.MARTINA gun.   Rather than a knife.

He gives a little gesture with it to the handle of the
knife protruding from a back pocket of Blomkvist's jeans.
There are fresh drops of blood on the floor next to his
shoes.MARTINYou just couldn't stay away, could
          you.

Blomkvist doesn't know what to say. Martin's demeanor,
even in this situation, remains cordial.124.124.MARTINI want to show you something.     Bring
                your drink. Leave the knife.

      Blomkvist's hope of getting out of here unscathed is
      pretty much gone now. He pulls the knife from his back
      pocket and sets it on a side table.224   INT. VANGER ARCHIVES BUILDING - NIGHT                    224Salander strides past the napping night watchman without

      They come through a pantry, at the end of which is a
      door.MARTINOpen it.
      Blomkvist does. Sees steps leading into darkness. As
      they descend Martin flicks a switch and bare fluorescent
      tubes flicker on to reveal: A furnace. Washer. Dryer.
      Old discarded furniture. And another door. A steel one.
      As they approach it, Martin presses a little remote and
      the lock on the steel door clicks.MARTINPush it open.227   INT. BASEMENT ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS                      227As Blomkvist steps across the threshold -125.125.MARTINSwitch is on the left.

       Blomkvist flips it and a row of overhead fluorescent
       tubes flickers on - one after the other - revealing a
       subterranean torture chamber:

       Metal eyelets bolted to the concrete walls and ceiling
       and floor - table with leather straps - bed with leather
       straps - steel-mesh cage - work bench with handsaws and
       other tools -

       Blomkvist takes it in with one glance and immediately
       turns to try to smash the glass in his hand into Martin's
       face - which is covered now with a plastic oxygen mask he
       holds to it. Gas plumes down on Blomkvist from above;
       the glass comes out of his hand, shattering on the cement
       floor -228    EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - NIGHT                                 228The Honda's single headlight shudders as Salander comes

       that runs through a metal eyelet. He sees Martin behind
       a video camera on a tripod, focusing it - a shelf full of
       Betamax tapes - and a TV monitor on which his own image
       then appears.
       Note: the steel door if we were close enough to it to
       notice - which we aren't - is not locked. It's not even
       completely shut.

       Satisfied with the framing of the shot of his guest,
       Martin takes a seat on a comfortable armchair upholstered
       in clear plastic. It squeaks.

       He regards Blomkvist calmly.   Sips his drink.    Then
       almost sighs.MARTINWhy didn't you just go home.BLOMKVISTI assume you mean the opportunity
                 for that has passed.

       Martin smiles, appreciating, perhaps, Blomkvist's "easy"
       manner in this dire circumstance.MARTINHow'd you do it? What did you find?126.126.Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ

Blomkvist doesn't say. Martin looks like he has all the
time in the world to wait, and does. Then -MARTINWe can talk or we can just get on
          with it. It's really up to you.

Nothing from Blomkvist. Martin shrugs `okay,' gets up,
goes to his workbench and takes a plastic shower curtain
from it. As he's laying it on the floor around his
victim, Blomkvist changes his mind -BLOMKVISTI found a picture no one had seen
          before.MARTINOf.BLOMKVISTYou. In your Uppsala prep school

suspending his shower curtain work to return to the
chair. It squeaks again.MARTINWhat does that say?BLOMKVISTThat you lied about where you were

can do this alone -MARTINWhat do I do with my guests? Is that

      Silence ...MARTINSay something.BLOMKVISTYou are a sick fuck.MARTIN... Is this an interview or an
                editorial?

      Blomkvist, of course, doesn't answer, or comment, yet
      Martin considers what the journalist hasn't said ...

      ("Martin, civilized people don't do what you do.")MARTINYou're right, this behavior is
                unacceptable. I know that. But
                we're not completely different. We
                both have desires. Satisfying mine
                just requires more towels.
      Martin regards Blomkvist in a silence.    Then -MARTINAnything else you want to know?
                     (pause)

      Blomkvist not coming back.
      Nothing but the sky darkening to night. Then -131.131.Headlights coming through frame.
      A figure appearing on foot at the front gate.
      The figure just standing there, looking at the cottage.
      The figure approaching it, and, as it's trying the locked
      front door, the motion detection light snapping on and
      illuminating Martin.
      Martin moving to the side, looking in a kitchen window,
      coming around front again, walking to the gate, turning
      around, looking back, then walking out of frame.231   INT. MARTIN'S BASEMENT - NIGHT                          231Blomkvist hangs from the block-and-tackle rig, leather
      strap around his neck now, fed through a ceiling eyelet.
      With a big sewing scissors, Martin cuts through and
      removes Blomkvist's pants and underwear -MARTINIt might amuse you to know that
                while you were over here having
                dinner with me and Liv - who, by the
                way, finds me very conventional -
                Irina was down here in the cage.
                Who's Irina, you ask? A girl I met
                in Belarus. Just another girl.
                Another immigrant whore. Who misses
                them?

      He returns to his work bench to lay out various tools
      next to his gun and a desk phone.BLOMKVISTYour sister wasn't just another girl.
      Martin comes back quickly and yanks a strap that cinches
      the noose tighter around Blomkvist's neck as it lifts him
      onto his tiptoes.MARTINWhat happened to her.BLOMKVISTYou're choking me -MARTINYou found her?BLOMKVISTYou killed her.

      Martin just stares at him confused.   Then -MARTINYou useless fuckin detective.132.132.He lets go of the strap and Blomkvist's feet come back
down to the floor. As Martin returns to his workbench,
Blomkvist is not only scared to death, but confused now.
Did Martin not kill her?

Then Martin is back in front of him with a roll of
cellophane, pulls on the strap again until Blomkvist is
balancing on his tiptoes, and ties it off.MARTINToo tight to talk?
It is.   Blomkvist can utter no sound but a gag.MARTINGood.   I'm tired of talking to you.

He wraps Blomkvist's head in cellophane, completely
cutting off his ability to breathe, and calmly watches
him struggle. ...MARTINWould you like me to do something
           about that?

Blomkvist desperately nods as he's about to suffocate.
Martin watches another several moments ... then pokes a
finger through the cellophane into Blomkvist's gasping
mouth.MARTINSee?    I'm not a monster.
He frames a wide shot of his naked prey. Turns on some
music. Takes a moment to collect himself from all this
strenuous work. Brushes back his hair like he wants to
look presentable in the shot. Then smiles pleasantly -MARTINYou know, I've never had a man in
           here. I've never touched a man as a
           matter of fact. Except my father, of
           course. But that was my duty.
           Harriet's, too.

The circulation to Blomkvist's head is being cut off by
the strap. His fingers behind his naked back claw at the
concrete wall to try to relieve some of the weight on the
noose, but can't get a grip. Martin watches the struggle
calmly, and just as calmly offers:MARTINIt's time. I don't want to be late
           for my date with our girlfriend.133.133.Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ

He puts on a plastic rain poncho. A painter's mask.
Plastic goggles. Surgeons gloves. Picks up a hunting
knife. Steps up to Blomkvist. Looks at his eyes.
Brings his own head close to his victim's -MARTINGoodbye, Mikael.
He pulls the strap, lifting Blomkvist's toes off the
floor, closing off his air again ... and is about to gut
him like a wild boar ... when he hears a sound like some
kind of animal behind him ...

He turns and sees her - coming at him from out of the
shadows by the steel door -
He darts for the gun he left on the workbench -
Salander just as quickly swings a 5-iron - his 5-iron -
like a baseball bat. Its metal-wedged end arcs through
the gloom and slams into the side of his head, sending
him tumbling to the floor.

He struggles up to his knees, and she swings the club
again, splitting flesh and crushing bone as he crumples
the floor.
She takes the gun from the bench and shoves it in her
other back pocket. Grabs the hunting knife and shackles
key and hurries over to Blomkvist who only witnessed part
of the spectacle before losing consciousness -

She saws through the leather strap around his neck.
Unlocks the chain. As he sinks to his knees on the
floor, blood rushes to his head, bringing him back to
life just enough to see what she can't behind her -

Martin, blood streaming from the gash in his head,
getting to his feet. But he's not coming at them; he's
trying to get out -

Blomkvist tries to say her name to get her to look.
Lifts a hand to try to point. She turns and glimpses the
monster as he disappears out the steel door. Looks back
at Blomkvist, still handcuffed on the floor, and, like a
child asking a parent for permission -SALANDERMay I kill him?

Nothing in his life would allow him to agree to such a
thing - until now. Now it's as if her years of violence
and degradation have been passed to him.

He nods.134.134.She puts the hunting knife in his hand. Pulls the gun
      from her back pocket, checks the clip, flicks off the
      safety, and turns to leave -BLOMKVISTHe has more guns in the den -SALANDERI know.

      She comes up the basement stairs, leading with her gun.
      Distant thunder rumbles. She crosses through the kitchen
      to the living room, and down the hall to the study. She
      eases around the doorway - the room is empty - looks to
      the gun case - sees there are only two rifles there now.
      She hears an engine start outside. Hurries back through
      the house. Sees out the picture window the taillights of
      Martin's car receding fast down the road as clouds burst.

      She bangs out the front door. Runs halfway down the
      hill in the rain to where she left her motorcycle, jumps
      on and kick-starts it.232   EXT. THE BRIDGE - NIGHT                                 232She roars onto the bridge, chasing the taillights.
      Guns the bike to full throttle. Comes alongside him.
      He swerves to try to crush her against the railing -
      but she hits the brakes, avoiding the impact -

      She accelerates again and comes up on the other side
      of the car. He swerves again at her, but this time the
      bike pulls ahead of him. Now he's chasing her -

      He gains on her as they near the end of the bridge. As
      they race off it, he goes in for the kill, but she veers
      hard to one side, leaving him headed straight for the gas
      station Blomkvist makes his pay phone calls from - and
      the tanker truck parked there -

      Martin hits the brakes - hydroplanes into the truck - and
      its, or his own tank, or both, explode -
      Salander circles back. Regards the fire engulfing the
      car. The rain does nothing to dampen it. She could
      probably brave it to pull Martin out - but doesn't.
      As the flames burn his clothes, he manages to get his
      hands on the rifle he took from the den, turns its barrel
      to his bloody head - but before he can pull the trigger,
      she hurries over, yanks it from his grasp and stands back
      again. It's much more cathartic to watch him burn ...135.135.233   INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT                        233She finds Blomkvist in the living room. Sitting in a
      chair, his coat wrapped around him. The hunting knife in
      his hand. Distant sirens echo.    He can still just
      barely manage to speak -BLOMKVISTWhere is he?SALANDERDead.234   EXT. HEDESTAD - DAWN                                       234Reminiscent of the last photographs taken on the Hedeby
      Island bridge forty years ago, police and firemen finish
      up at the crash site. A winch drags Martin's charred
      black wreck of a car onto a tow truck.235   INT. COTTAGE BEDROOM - MORNING                             235Blomkvist is asleep in the bedroom with what looks like
      a neck tattoo - the black and blue mark left by Martin's
      noose that nearly strangled him to death. He doesn't
      hear the knock at the front door, nor -SALANDER O/SIt's open.

      the picture of calm, drinking a cup of black coffee.FRODEWhere's Mikael?SALANDERAsleep.   Coffee? There's no milk.

      toward the bedroom -FRODEI have to talk to (Mikael) -SALANDERLet him sleep.

      It's not a request; it's a command.236   INT. COTTAGE - LATER - MORNING                           236Frode is ashen as he leafs through a binder Salander
      brought from Martin's chamber of horrors late last night:

      A scrapbook of murder. A death book. Photos of women
      cowering in his cage, tied to the bed, dead on the table -
      along with souvenirs of painted fingernails and locks of
      hair - all carefully taped into the `album.' The older
      photographs are Polaroids; the newer ones digital prints.
      With little to no discernible emotion, Salander watches
      Frode wince as he turns the pages.

      Frode can't take it anymore. Closes the book before
      reaching the end. Just sits there.FRODEWhat are we going to do?SALANDERWe're going home, Mikael and me.
                I don't know what you're going to do.FRODEI'm going to the police.SALANDERShow them the videos while you're at

       fully-clothed, watching him. Is she actually there, or
       part of a dream? He looks at her a long moment, then
       tries out his voice -BLOMKVISTHow is it someone who's 23 is a ward
                  of the state?SALANDERI'm mentally incompetent and can't
                  manage daily life.

      bought. Pushes over two faded Polaroid photos. He picks
      them up:
      One shows a young girl about 14, naked from the waist up,
      head turned half-away from the camera. The second shows
      her on her stomach on a bed, completely naked, face
      turned to the photographer, frightened.BLOMKVISTHarriet?SALANDERI think so.

      Blomkvist can't look at the photos long.       Sets them
      down. Something's troubling him -BLOMKVISTMartin didn't deny killing anyone.
                But when I mentioned Harriet, he was
                confused. He was angry - at me - for
                not being able to tell him what
                happened to her.
                     (pause)

                person in this family who would know

      Such a possibility stuns the old man. He regards
      Blomkvist a moment. Then Salander ...VANGERWould the young lady mind giving us
                a moment of privacy.BLOMKVISTShe's my partner, Henrik.     She should

      smashes him in the head with the flat side of an oar. It

      hold of them to claw himself from the water, she brings
      the sharp edge of the oar down, burying it in his head
      like an axe.

      scaffolding, waits as long as it should take them to get
      inside the building, then peers out again -
      They're not inside. They've stopped just outside the
      building's entrance. They're embracing. And the longer
      they stand there together, the sharper the pain stabs at
      Salander.

      Finally they separate, but only to allow Blomkvist to
      unlock the door. Erika takes his hand then, and they
      disappear inside.165.165.Salander   can't move. Waits for the pain to subside -
which it   eventually does - but only to be replaced with a
sense of   helplessness. Then that subsides, replaced with
a facade   of insouciance.

The richest girl in Sweden emerges from the alcove and
walks back the way she came - tossing the garment bag and
card into a construction dumpster - climbs onto her Honda
- starts it - and drives off -

Probably forever.
