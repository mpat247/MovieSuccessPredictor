                            Steven Knight1   EXT. A STREET NEAR BRICK LANE - EVENING                       1It's 5.30pm in late December and rain is pouring. The
    scant Christmas decorations are hanging limp in the rain.
    A young Turk (EKREM) runs through the rain with a Turkish
    newspaper held over his head. He ducks into a traditional
    barber's shop called Ozim's.2   INT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP - EVENING                             2The shutters are drawn. OZIM (a plump middle-aged Turk)
    is cutting the hair of the last customer of the day (SOYKA).
    Soyka is a Chechen, well-groomed, wearing a sharp suit
    beneath the barber's gown.

    During the conversation we glimpse distinctive eagle- and
    star-shaped tattoos on Soyka's arms and hands.

    Ozim and Soyka are chatting as Ekrem enters.   Soyka speaks
    with a Russian accent.OZIMGuvenilmez... daginik... bloody
              kids, you know... he says - `but
              Amca it's Christmas?... Christmas!
              We're Islam!SOYKAOi, how much are you taking off?OZIMChristmas! So I said to him...
              alisverise cimac. The kid's
              sixteen...

    Ozim brushes some hair off the customer's shoulder and
    Ozim finally acknowledges Ekrem, who is shivering and wet
    near to the door. Ekrem turns the `Open' sign to `Closed'.OZIM (CONT'D)They don't want to work do they.
              Shicma....EKREM(hesitantly
                   interrupting)

    We see for the first time that Ekrem is shaking with fear
    as well as cold.(CONTINUED)WHITE Revision    -   9/12/06                               2.2   CONTINUED:                                                         2OZIMThis is him.     The kid I'm talking
                 about.

    Ekrem approaches, stiffened by terror.       Soyka nods at Ekrem
    in the mirror.SOYKAHe looks OK to me... how you doin'
                 Ekrem?

    Soyka offers Ekrem a hand to shake and Ekrem stares at it
    as if it were enchanted...OZIMHe looks OK, yeah, but he won't do
                 one lousy thing for me. Here,
                 look... Ekrem, take this...

    Ozim takes an open razor from behind a line of hair-tonic
    bottles and hands it to Ekrem, who now looks mortally
    terrified.EKREMOzim... memnum etmek.OZIMWe had a deal now he's backing
                 out.SOYKA(laughing)
                 Hey Ozim, leave the kid alone.
                 It's obviously a psychological
                 thing...OZIMTake it Ekrem.SOYKAOzim, it's OK. I don't want a shave.OZIMThis is the kid who walks around
                 like Al Capone. Take the fucking
                 ustura and finish this Rushca.SOYKA(startled)

    gown. Ozim yells `kabuka! And Ekrem snarls, flicks open
    the razor and drags it across Soyka's throat. Soyka's scream
    bubbles in the blood.3   EXT. KILBURN HIGH ROAD - NIGHT                                 3We dissolve to a Christmas decoration flashing on and off
    in the rain, high on a lamp post in Kilburn High Road. We
    pan down the lamp post to the High Road where revelers are
    hurrying through the rain. We see a young girl (TATIANA)
    hurrying across the street, wrapped in a dressing gown
    with a man's overcoat thrown over the top of it. Her hair
    is soaked as she approaches an all night chemist's shop.
    She is barefoot.4   INT. CHEMIST'S SHOP - NIGHT                                    4The CHEMIST is delivering advice in Gujurati to a CUSTOMER.
    Tatiana wipes rain from her face and the Chemist and the
    customer react to her ragged appearance.TATIANA(Russian accent)
              Please... I have...CHEMISTFor methadone I need to see paper
              prescription.

    The customer looks at Tatiana's feet and reacts. We see
    blood trickling down her legs. Tatiana looks down, then
    faints onto the floor.5   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. OPERATING WARD - NIGHT                5We see Tatiana unconscious on a wheeled trolley bursting
    through double doors into the operating ward of Trafalgar
    hospital. The trolley is accompanied by TWO NURSES, a
    JUNIOR DOCTOR and a midwife, (ANNA KHITROVA). The two
    PARAMEDICS who brought her are following behind the trolley.ANNADid you get a name?PARAMEDICNo.(CONTINUED)BLUE Revision    -   11/4/06                                 4.5   CONTINUED:                                                        5CUT TO6   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. OPERATING THEATER - NIGHT                6A tiny brown handbag is being shaken empty by a nurse.
    Tatiana is being prepared for an emergency Caesarean. The
    theater is full of people in scrubs, including an
    anesthetist. Monitors and drips are being attached at double
    speed.

    We notice that her arms are already dotted with festering
    needle marks.

    A nurse searches through the contents of the handbag and
    we can hear frantic activity from the operating table....NURSE 1Her stats are very poor, very poor.
                 Baby's very distressed.

    Anna approaches the nurse, who is rummaging through the
    contents of the bag. We see a business card from a
    restaurant called `The Trans-Siberian', a St. Christopher
    necklace and a tiny battered diary. Anna grabs the diary.JUNIOR DOCTORShoulder distocia, I think.   Stuck
                 on the pubic bone.

    Cut to Anna at Tatiana's head.    Anna strokes her face and

    THE JUNIOR DOCTOR is breathing hard with a look of utter
    panic as he attempts to free the baby.

    The doors burst open and a more senior doctor in his mid
    thirties (DOCTOR AZIZ) enters at a gallop. As he enters...(CONTINUED)WHITE Revision    -   9/12/06                            5.6   CONTINUED:                                                    6NURSE 1Baby stats sixty-eight and in free

    out of his depth.AZIZSpeak to me...

    Before the junior doctor can speak Anna speaks directly to
    Aziz.ANNA(softly)
                 We need to get the baby out now.

    Aziz knows he can take Anna's word...AZIZOK, let's go.

    All hell is let loose. As the Caesarean process begins at
    frantic speed, we slowly zoom in on Tatiana's unconscious
    face and hear her voice in V.O... a young girl's voice
    speaking with an Russian accent. The crosstalk between
    nurses and doctors becomes more and more frantic.TATIANA (V.O.)My name is Tatiana. My father
                 died in the mines in my village,
                 so he was already buried when he
                 died. We were all buried there.
                 Buried under the soil of Russia.
                 That is why I left to find a better
                 life.

    We hear... a baby cry. Anna's face appears in our framed
    shot of Tatiana's face. She gently kisses Tatiana's cheek.ANNA(whispers)
                 You had a girl.

    A sheet is pulled over Tatiana's face. A nurse weighs the
    screaming baby. Anna wipes her brow with the back of her
    bloody wrist.(CONTINUED)BLUE Revision     -   11/4/06                           6.6   CONTINUED: (2)                                                6AZIZOk.   Call it.

    to catch her up and hands her a wrapped gift.AZIZMerry Christmas, Anna.ANNAOh, don't be ridiculous.

    He grins.AZIZAnd you have to open it in front
                of me.

    gloves. She looks up at him, expressionless.AZIZ (CONT'D)At least pretend.

    morning streets. As she rides, we hear Tatiana in V.O.TATIANA (V.O.)I am so excited this morning.

    in Anna's bedroom where the curtains are drawn. Anna is
    lying awake on the bed, wearing a dressing gown.TATIANA (V.O.)...he said the future of everything
                 was already happening in all those
                 places.

    There is a gentle knock at the door, which opens before
    Anna can respond. It is ANNA'S MOTHER (HELEN) with a cup
    of tea.HELENDid you sleep?ANNAA bit.HELENThere's no point us tiptoeing around
                 if you're not even sleeping.

     peelers in their wet hands, sleeves rolled up, two practical
     unsentimental women being almost consumed by the same wave
     of emotion.HELENIt wouldn't be Christmas without

     As Anna pulls up we hear a dog begin to bark.13   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. SIDE ENTRANCE - DAY               13The side door opens to reveal a hard-looking, handsome
     Russian man (NIKOLAI), who stops to groom his hair back
     from his face and put on a pair of sunglasses as he emerges
     into daylight. He steps into a small courtyard, where a
     fierce Doberman dog is barking and snarling on the end of
     a chain.

     Nikolai is followed by KIRILL, who is a little younger,
     slim and pretty but hard-looking too. Kirill is dressed in
     a crumpled T-shirt and jeans and looks like he had a heavy
     night. Nikolai ignores the dog as he walks by but Kirill
     yells at it and teases it with a whoop and few Russian
     curses. Nikolai unbolts the gate to the street.KIRILLSo you pick up Ozim and his bitch
                  of a wife and you bring them back

     fades. We sense jealousy.KIRILL (CONT'D)Hey, you've got work to do.   Go...

     Kirill grabs Nikolai's face to distract him, gives him a
     playful slap, but there is somehow more to it than
     playfulness. Nikolai gets into his car.

     when the door opens. We see SEMYON, a Russian man in his
     late sixties. He is wiping his hands on a tea towel,

     smoke. Family members, some dressed in their party outfits,
     others in chefs' uniforms, are standing over steaming pots,
     laughing, arguing. Children play and yell. You can almost
     smell Christmas. Anna enters, dazzled by it all,

     and parks a few inches from Anna's motorbike. The rear
     windows are sun shaded so we only see Nikolai in the
     driver's seat.   He gets out of the car and opens the rear
     door of the car for an elegantly dressed Turkish lady in
     her fifties. Nikolai goes to the other rear door. The
     portly figure of Ozim the barber emerges. As Ozim gets out
     he gives Nikolai a fifty-pound note.18   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. KITCHEN - DAY                   18Two of the little girl violinists are fighting, pulling

     floor. A young woman in a party dress is carrying a huge
     silver bowl of sauce across the kitchen.

     Anna looks delighted at the noise and energy of the place.

     at a table alone, well out of their earshot, smoking a
     cigarette and peeling glazed figs. As Anna walks by, Ozim
     and Kirill stop talking. The scene has a much darker mood
     to the bustling scene in the kitchen, but for now Anna
     feels no unease. As she passes, Kirill surveys her with a
     deadly smile and a professional eye.KIRILLHey, you OK?     You want a drink?ANNANo, thanks.     I'm driving.

     four expensive-looking cars have already parked and various
     ostentatiously dressed Russian and Turkish couples with
     their children are emerging from their cars. The women are
     all wearing furs, even the little girls. The men wear
     leather or dark suits. They greet each other exuberantly
     as they emerge from their cars. Anna suddenly feels
     slightly uneasy. As she approaches her motorbike she sees
     Nikolai leaning against the bonnet of his car, smoking,

     package bound up in black bin liners which are dusted with
     frost. Kirill nods to Nikolai who grabs the package and
     hauls it out onto the kitchen floor. Kirill tears a hole
     in the bin liner and we see the frost-dusted face of Soyka.(CONTINUED)BLUE Revision     -   11/4/06                                 25.29   CONTINUED:                                                          29Kirill studies the face and nods.KIRILLThat's him.

     Kirill reaches into his pocket and produces an envelope
     which he hands to Ozim. As Ozim opens the envelope and
     begins to count the huge wad of cash, Kirill turns to
     Nikolai.KIRILL (CONT'D)OK, Nikolai, he's all yours. And
                  show some respect. This Muslim is
                  scared of ghosts.

     gruesome scene.(CONTINUED)WHITE Revision    -   9/12/06                            26.30   CONTINUED:                                                     30Nikolai has the body of Soyka laid out on a surface, his
     head still bound up in a bin bag, his lower portions bound
     up similarly. Nikolai is de-frosting Soyka's left hand
     with the hair dryer, concentrating on his ring finger which
     has a gold ring on it. The parts of Soyka's shirt and
     jacket which are visible are crusted with frozen blood.
     Nikolai is wearing rubber gloves.

     As he dries, Nikolai takes a sip of coffee. Ozim is
     watching this scene with horror. Kirill has his arms
     folded, mightily impressed.

     Finally the hand is thawed enough for Nikolai to remove
     the gold ring. He studies an inscription and then offers
     it to Ozim. Ozim shakes his head as if the thing were a
     contagion. Nikolai shrugs and pockets it. He then turns
     the hair dryer back on and blows some hot air onto the
     crisply bloody chest of Soyka. He tugs at the frozen lapel
     of the jacket and blows air into the inside pocket. Within
     a few moments he is able to remove Soyka's glistening,
     thawing wallet which is caked in frozen blood. He opens
     it (we glimpse a photo of a wife and children) and blows
     hot air onto the money inside.

     He tugs a wad of frozen bank notes from the wallet, all
     stuck together by drops of frozen blood. He offers this
     money to Ozim as well but Ozim shakes his head vigorously.
     Kirill hoots with laughter. Ozim is now staring at Nikolai
     as if he were a devil from hell.

     Nikolai grabs a plastic bag and puts the money inside it,
     then pockets the frozen wad. He tosses the rest of the
     frozen wallet to Ozim, who instinctively catches it.NIKOLAIYou'd better burn that.

     Ozim, reacting to the cold of the wallet and to the horror
     of it, drops the thing on the floor. Nikolai looks at
     Ozim as if he were a complete amateur.NIKOLAI (CONT'D)Did you finish cutting his hair?

     Ozim can't answer.NIKOLAI (CONT'D)I just thought you might want six-

     himself.NIKOLAI (CONT'D)OK, now I'm going to do his teeth

     Ozim thinks, decides, leaves fast.   A pause.NIKOLAI (CONT'D)You too, Kirill.

     Kirill smiles and pats Nikolai on the cheek.

     Kirill leaves. Nikolai is left alone. His hand shakes a
     little as he picks up his cup of coffee.31   EXT. NINE ELMS. ABANDONED DOCK - MORNING                         31Nikolai pulls up beside a rusting crane on the abandoned
     dock in a dry-cleaner's van. Kirill watches as Nikolai
     grabs the semi-thawed body, now bagged and tied, lifts it
     onto his shoulder, and smartly approaches the dockside.KIRILLAren't you going to weight him
               down or something?

     where before there was family and uproar. Outside it's
     dark and raining. He is reading a Russian crime novel. A
     half-empty bottle of vodka sits on the table.

                  it to Tatiana's daughter someday.

     Semyon looks thwarted but hides it well. He studies the
     photocopied sheets for a while then looks up and smiles.SEMYONI will need my spectacles and a
                  clear head. Today I broke my rules
                  and drank vodka. Tomorrow I will

     Nikolai manages to lift him to his feet again. As they
     head towards the restaurant, Anna emerges. Nikolai looks
     up, curious, as Semyon kisses her on both cheeks in the
     doorway. As she turns Kirill stumbles forwards and collapses
     in front of her. Nikolai looks up at Anna, his face
     splashed with rain.NIKOLAI (CONT'D)What? You never seen anybody pissed
                  before?

     totally unconscious, breathing deeply. Nikolai smiles.NIKOLAIWe went to a Kurdish place. They
                  don't even celebrate Christmas.

      the tent two senior police officers await the arrival of a
      third man, a specialist from the Russian desk (YURI), who
      is not dressed for the weather. He has obviously been
      dragged out of bed. He is led to the side of the body.
      One of the officers pulls up the dead man's hand and shows
      him the eagle tattoo.OFFICERWe think he might be Russian Mafia.

      Yuri studies the tattoo, then borrows a torch. He crouches
      to push up the wet trouser leg on the corpse's right leg.

      star tattooed on the knee cap.YURIHe is actually a Chechen. He is
                also a member of the vory v zakone.

     The curtains are drawn against daylight. The living room
     is decorated in seventies suburban style, but with the
     wall paper peeling and the paint work fading. Kitsch
     paintings still decorate the walls.

     Six young East-European girls are sitting on a broken-down
     sofa and on hard-backed chairs, wearing short skirts. Their
     eyes are sunken and their faces vacant of expression, but
     they are painted with so much make-up they almost look
     like tiny, sad clowns.

     They sit in silence as the music blares out. After a few

     All the girls apart from one immediately get to their feet
     and begin to dance to the music, their bodies moving
     awkwardly and painfully. The Albanian approaches the one
     girl who refused to stand and yanks her to her feet.

     He slaps her hard and hisses at her in Albanian. She tries
     to sit down again but he pulls her up and slaps her again.

     begins to dance, sobbing as she does.ALBANIAN (CONT'D)No fucking crying. It's a party!43   EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY                                        43Kirill and Nikolai are climbing out of Nikolai's Mercedes.

     and swinging his girl around faster and faster until she
     falls over.

     Nikolai swigs his drink and notices the girl who refused
     to stand up. She is standing in the corner, sobbing.

     he walks. He stops to take a piss on someone's grave.

     of wine. Flour, grease and potatoes are stored here. As
     Nikolai walks down the steps into the gloom, he hears Kirill
     singing a Russian folk song to himself as he drags a case
     of brandy across the cellar floor.

     Kirill has already opened a bottle of brandy and takes a
     long swig as Nikolai joins him. He grins as he gestures
     at the brandy...KIRILLMy dad swapped a little Georgian
               girl for this stuff.

     Nikolai sits down on a crate, rests his head against the
     wall. Kirill joins him and swigs some more.KIRILL (CONT'D)Hey, don't feel bad. What happened
               up there is just how he is. He

     A long pause. This is what Kirill wanted, but now it feels
     like a stab in the back. Finally Kirill swallows a huge
     swig of brandy then turns awkwardly to hug Nikolai. He
     squeezes him hard for a long time then shoves him away.KIRILL(lying))

     Nikolai climbs the steps. Kirill is left to swig his brandy
     and stare into the darkness. He wipes his eyes angrily
     with his sleeve.66   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. TWO DAYS LATER - NIGHT         66Sweet Russian choral music covers the next four scenes.

     The street outside the restaurant is now flooding with
     rain. A Daimler and a Bentley are already parked. A large
     SUV pulls up and a hard-looking Russian man in his sixties
     (VALERY) is ushered from the car by bodyguards in suits
     and shades.

     He is greeted by a darker-looking man in his fifties (THE
     GYPSY) who has a fur coat around his shoulders. Semyon is
     waiting on the doorstep, dressed in a fine dark suit.67   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                         67The curtains are drawn against the rainy light. The Gypsy,
     Valery, Semyon and TWO OTHER RUSSIAN MEN are sitting in a
     line behind a restaurant table, like a judging panel.

     After a moment Nikolai enters, dressed in suit and tie for
     the biggest interview of his life.

     The vory behind the table greet him.

     Then Nikolai takes off his jacket and removes his tie. He
     then takes off his shirt, to reveal that his upper body is
     decorated with elaborate tattoos (details to follow).

     He carefully places his shirt over the chair then sits
     down. The panel of the vory study his body, the Gypsy
     pushing a candle across the table to better illuminate the
     detail of the tattoos. Only after the men have studied
     the tattoos does the interview begin.(CONTINUED)WHITE Revision       -   9/12/06                                78.67   CONTINUED:                                                            67The following dialogue should not be translated, and can

     The questions and answers are delivered with great
     solemnity, making the ceremony feel almost religious.
     Candles burn, the men all sip water.

     Semyon is silent throughout but listens attentively.
     Towards the end of the interview there is the ghost of a
     smile on the Gypsy's face and this pleases Semyon.68   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. REAR ENTRANCE - NIGHT         68A wizened old Russian man (THE TATTOOIST) arrives at the

     only his underpants. We circle Nikolai as the tattooist
     begins to work on his knees, preparing Nikolai's knee caps
     for the tattoos.

     The needle bites at Nikolai's skin as the old tattooist
     wipes away the blood.

     Then we see the needle working on the empty spaces above
     Nikolai's heart, tattooing the star symbol.

     Nikolai now has a star tattoo on each knee and two eight-
     pointed stars on his chest. He is now a member of the vory

     More rain. Ozim is waiting nervously, blowing into his
     hands against the cold. The Turkish bath building is a
     Victorian red-brick edifice.

     steam room door opens but the steam is now so thick he
     can't see who has entered.NIKOLAIOzim?

     He sees a shape... a clothed body. He realizes immediately.
     Suddenly one of the brothers is upon him and has him in a
     head lock. He strokes the tattoo on Nikolai's chest as if
     this were confirmation of who this is. He grunts an
     instruction and his brother emerges through the steam with
     an open razor.

     Nikolai is naked, alone.

     Suddenly he kicks the razor guy in the balls and uses a
     martial arts chop to free himself from the other brother.
     In the steam there are boots and bare feet and knees and
     fingers flying. Nikolai manages to gouge the eye of one
     brother and throw another against the wall. He obviously
     has serious combat training but the brothers are strong
     and angry.

     Suddenly Nikolai is slashed across the arm by the razor
     and blood oozes into the steam and hot water. All the men
     are slipping and falling on the blood and hot water.
     Another slash of the razor cuts his thigh open. All the
     men are now covered in blood and Nikolai, with a final
     surge of strength, manages to cripple one brother with a
     blow to the throat, and the other with an elbow to the
     temple.

     As the Chechens slump to the floor, Nikolai fumbles in the
     bloody water for the razor, finds it, kneels, and slashes
     their throats. He lurches to his feet, drops the razor,
     and staggers out of the steam room.77   OMITTED                                                      77GOLDENROD Revision     -   11/27/06                       84.78   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. A AND E DEPARTMENT. CANTEEN - DAY      78Aziz and a group of a dozen doctors and nurses are eating

     hospital near the elevators.

     Anna comes down a stairwell and spots Kirill - she
     especially notices the roses - just as he gets into an
     elevator. The elevator doors close. Was it really him?
     Anna is not sure. She frowns.93   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. EMPTY CORRIDOR - NIGHT               93A door opens and Kirill steps into striped moonlight.
     Clamping the roses under his arm, he pulls a black zip-up
     sports bag from under his coat. After a brief dialogue
     with himself, he produces a half bottle of vodka and takes
     a swig. Then he hurries on.94   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. S.C.B.U. CHRISTINE'S PRIVATE ROOM -94NIGHTAnna walks onto the ward in her uniform. She checks a few
     stats as she walks by various beds. She then glances over
     at Christine's private room. She tiptoes into the room
     and goes to the crib. She finds it empty - except for a
     bunch of red roses. Outside the ward is now filling up
     with visitors. Babies cry, people laugh.

     Anna goes back out to the ward and calls to a nurse.ANNASonya! Is someone bathing
               Christine?SONYANo.   She's in her cot.ANNA(calmly)
               Well she's not. She's not.

     from his bottle of vodka, which is now more than half empty.
     He fires the engine and reverses. A car passing by has to
     slam on its brakes. Kirill yells.KIRILLHey, you stupid fucker!!

     A horn blows. The passing car accelerates angrily by. Then
     we hear a baby crying. Kirill looks into the half darkness
     of the back seat and we see Kirill's black sports bag,
     partially zipped up. Christine is crying inside it, her
     little grasping hand protruding past the zipper. Kirill
     speaks softly.KIRILL (CONT'D)Be quiet baby. Quiet baby.    It'sOK.PINK Revision     -   11/12/06                         102.98   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. WARD OUTSIDE NIKOLAI'S ROOM -        98NIGHTAnna flies out of Nikolai's room and spots a nurse.ANNAWhat happened to the patient with

     Nikolai reacts.ANNA (CONT'D)You bastards!! Where will he take
               her?! Tell me!!

     People back away as Nikolai grabs Anna's arms and holds
     her still.NIKOLAIWhat are you talking about?!

     Anna studies Nikolai's face and sees his genuine confusion.
     She calms down a little.ANNAKirill. Kirill has taken Christine.
               I saw him here! I thought he was
               coming to see you, but he wasn't,

       this as the best place to dispose of a body. Kirill pulls
       up slowly in Nikolai's Mercedes. The car is parked for a
       long time before finally the headlights are switched off.101    EXT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. MATERNITY UNIT - NIGHT               101Nikolai and Anna race to Anna's motorbike.NIKOLAII'll drive.ANNAI'll drive.

       zip-up bag before him. Suddenly fireworks begin to burst
       over the Thames. It is the stroke of midnight.

       Kirill unzips the bag. When he looks inside Christine
       stops crying. He peers at her, wiping away tears.KIRILLShe's a little girl, Papa, a little
                 sweet fucking girl...

       Kirill sobs then Christine cries...KIRILL (CONT'D)Shush, shush...

       Kirill lifts her out of the bag and holds her close to
       him, fireworks still illuminating the London skyline. He
       looks down at the freezing cold water, utterly confused.
       He whispers...KIRILL (CONT'D)(in Russian)

      we see Nikolai and Anna climbing off the bike. They
      approach cautiously. Kirill stares at the man he loves.
      A pause. Christine begins to cry.ANNAKirill, let me take the baby.KIRILLYou stay where you are.ANNAShe's cold, Kirill.

      Kirill suddenly screams as another barrage of fireworks
      explodes. Nikolai doesn't move. Kirill is dangerously
      close to the edge of the dock. Maybe he'll throw himself
      in too.NIKOLAIKirill, a vor doesn't kill little
                 babies.

      Kirill is motionless.NIKOLAI (CONT'D)Something like this would be bad
                 for all of us. Your dad has gone

      A pause.NIKOLAI (CONT'D)(in Russian)
                 It's our turn now.

      Nikolai steps forward slowly.    As he gets closer Kirill
      hugs the baby.

      Finally Nikolai reaches Kirill and hugs him. As he does
      he edges him away from the dockside. The three of them are
      locked in a long embrace.

      Nikolai emerges from the embrace with Christine in his
      arms. He quickly hands her to Anna who hugs her close.
      Kirill turns to Nikolai.KIRILLI swear I didn't know my dad was

      A pause.NIKOLAI (CONT'D)We can be partners again. Thunder
                   and lightning, right?

      Kirill smiles through his tears and nods.NIKOLAI (CONT'D)Get into the car. I'll drive you
                   home.

      A pause. Kirill dries his eyes and heads for the car.
      Nikolai looks at Anna, who is hugging the baby. He waits
      a long time before realizing he must leave her.NIKOLAI (CONT'D)You're OK, yeah?

      Anna nods.ANNAWho are you really? Why have you

      There is a long pause before he manages to finds a suitable
      lie.NIKOLAIHow can I become King if the King
                 is still in place?

      A pause.   He laughs.

      Anna studies him, unsure. More New Year fireworks explode
      over the river. Kirill yells from the car...KIRILLYou come on, Nikolai! We're missing
                 the fucking party of the year out
                 there!! Get here and drive!!

      She shakes her head.ANNAThere's someone I can call.   He'll
                 come and fetch us.

      Nikolai nods, not liking the information but hiding it.
      Nikolai comes close and gently uncovers Christine's face.
      He smiles. Kirill is hooting the car horn.

      After a moment Nikolai and Anna kiss each other gently
      before Nikolai heads for the car.103   OMITTED                                                       103*107104   INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. KITCHEN - DAY                             104*A summer's day. Anna, Helen and Uncle Stepan are preparing
      to eat Sunday lunch. Stepan is carving. The conversation
      is jovial as Anna and Helen bring dishes of food to the
      table.

      Then we hear a baby crying. Anna goes to a small crib and
      lifts a six-month-old Christine out. She hands her to
      Helen who hugs her. Over this happy scene we hear Tatiana
      in V.O., a repeat of the first words we heard her say.TATIANA (V.O.)My name is Tatiana. My father
                died in the mines in my village,
                so he was already buried when he

      Anna takes Christine back and takes her to the window to
      peer outside, staring across the park.105   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - SAME DAY                     105Nikolai is sitting at a window table, alone, sipping vodka,

                the soil of Russia. That is why I

      Nikolai finishes his drink.THE END
