Burbank, California 91522               All Rights ReservedPRINCE OF THIEVESFADE IN:SUNSETThe glowing orb ripples like a blood-red eye.BLACK, ROBED FIGUREA face of the ages. Dark, wrinkled skin. Wizened,
almond eyes. He howls at the sun. His voice ECHOES
across the sky. The Moslem call to prayer.
Hundreds of feet below his tower, a mud-walled city of
minarets and mosques. A human ants' nest. Scurrying to
their devotions.EXT. TWELFTH-CENTURY ARAB CITY - ESTABLISHING SHOTINT. DUNGEONS - SUNSETPervasive blackness. Moans of men in pain. Dripping
water. Rats. Filth. The nadir of human degradation.
Bedraggled white men, POWs from the Crusades, caged
together with Arab cutthroats. Jailers wrench two
crusaders from their cell. ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY and PETER
DUBOIS. Their appearance reeks of long imprisonment, but
remnants of their noble heritage still glimmer in their
faces. Peter is so frail he can barely walk.INT. TORTURE CHAMBER - SUNSETA furnace. Torture instruments glow red hot. Chained
victims. A massive INTERROGATOR scrutinizes the two
white men. Indicates a rat-faced lowlife, who points at
Peter, jabbering in Arabic.INTERROGATORHe says you stole his bread.PETERIt is a lie. I caught him
           stealing ours.
The lowlife jabbers some more.    The Interrogator debates.INTERROGATORCut off the infidel's hand.
The jailers haul Peter to the chopping block.(CONTINUED)2.CONTINUED:ROBINNo!... I took the bread.PETERThat's not true.ROBINThey're not interested in truth.
         You are too weak, Peter. You
         would not live through it.
The Interrogator stares into Robin's eyes.INTERROGATORSacrifice for the weaker? How
         noble... As you wish... Cut off
         this one's hand as well!... But
         first...
He indicates an Arab prisoner, who is dragged forward.
His struggling hand is laid on the executioner's block.INTERROGATORShow them the courage of Allah.
The prisoner's face braces for the pain. A red-hot
scimitar flashes down. The hand flips into a basket.
Twitching.
Robin is next. His composure fails. He flops to his
knees, crying. The Interrogator laughs. The jailers
unlash the thongs on Robin's hand. They stretch it out,
forcing it down. Robin goes limp, sobbing. Peter
catches his eye... Robin winks.
The scimitar. Drawn from the coals. Spitting flame.
Arcs down. Robin is suddenly galvanized.ROBINAnd this is English courage.
He hurls his holders aside. Swings upward, driving his
fast into the executioner's throat. Grabs the sword.
Slash. His thongs melt like butter. A jailer leaps at
him. Steaming, the scimitar slices into the man's chest.
Despite his bindings, Peter wrestles the Interrogator.
Knife pressed to his throat, Peter is forced against the
furnace. At the last second, he flips the man into the
fire. Screaming.PETERThat's for five years of hell.(CONTINUED)3.CONTINUED:A jailer aims a scalding blade at Robin's back.VOICE (O.S.)Behind you!
Warned, Robin ducks away.    Slams the jailer's head into
the wall.
Peter frees himself, but they are still outnumbered.
While fighting, Robin acknowledges the man who shouted
the warning. An imposing, shaven-headed SARACEN.
Heavily-muscled arms and chest, covered in tattoos. Even
his bald head is ornamented.ROBINYou speak English?SARACENThe king's own. Set me free.PETERNo, Robin.SARACENFor pity's sake. Mine is a
         sentence of death.
Robin sidesteps, propelling a guard into a pit.PETERDon't trust him.
Two more guards attack, yelling fury.    Robin eyes the
curved scimitar.ROBINWhat I would give for an English
         sword. This is a pruning hook.
A guard swings at him with a giant axe.    Robin slashes...
shears the axe handle in two.ROBINHmm!   Not bad.
He runs the man through. Peter loses his sword. His
opponent moves in for the kill... Peter grabs tongs from
the fire and smolders his opponent with a backhand.
Commotion outside.    RAISED VOICES and RUNNING FEET.SARACENFree me and I will show you a way
         out.(CONTINUED)4.CONTINUED:ROBINWhy should we trust you?SARACENIf you don't, you are dead men.ROBINHe makes a point.
The door bursts open.    More guards rush in.ROBINA good point.
He slashes the man free.PETERRobin!ROBINWhatever blood is in his veins, he
         does not deserve to die here.SARACENThis way!
He beckons them to the back.     A hidden door leads into a
tunnel.INT. SEWERS - NIGHTThey wade through foul water up to their waists. The
Saracen leads... A snake lashes out for his face. Robin
lops off its head.SARACENYou are fast, my friend.ROBINFive years I've waited for the
         smell of free air. That makes a
         man fast.
Guards drop down from above, carrying torches.    Blocking
the way.SARACENYou will need to be yet faster.
A narrow opening to their left... they splash through.
Half running, half crawling in the dank water. Fire
arrows land around them. The orange smoke is choking.(CONTINUED)5.CONTINUED:SARACENPoison air.   Hold your breath.
Flames illuminate the walls, alive with a loathsome mass
of crawling slime. Peter falls. A pursuer descends on
him, thrusting a blazing torch at his face. The Saracen
intercepts the blow. Grabs the man's neck, SNAPPING it
with one mighty twist.PETER(coughing)
         Thanks. I misjudged you.SARACENSave your breath.

Gasping for air, they find the tunnel veers steeply down-
ward. A slippery, granite tube. Losing purchase, they
slide headlong. Sharp, rusted spikes jut out from the
walls ahead.
Robin grabs at the walls to break the fall. No use.
They're picking up speed. He turns his sword crossways,
bracing it against the sides of the tunnel, as a brake.
Sparks fly. The sword cuts into Robin's chest... but it
works.SARACENAllah be praised.ROBINAmen, brother.
A bloodcurdling scream. A pursuing guard tumbles down
the sewer chute. The three men press themselves against
the wall. The man hurtles by... is impaled on the
spikes.
A draft of fresh air from the roof of the tunnel. Using
the spiked guard as a ladder, Robin climbs. Removes a
grating.EXT. ARAB STREET - NIGHTRobin's head appears... ducks back down, as a squad of
mounted soldiers thunders right over him... he reappears.
All clear. They're outside the prison wall. Robin helps
Peter up.ROBINGod willing, we may now be safe.(CONTINUED)6.CONTINUED:Swoosh. An arrow pierces through Peter's chest -- fired
from the prison wall. He reels... Robin leads him under
the wall for protection. Shouts of alarm. Soldiers
approaching.ROBINCome, Peter.    We must hurry.
Raising his sword, Peter faces the oncoming soldiers.PETERIt is mortal.    Leave me.ROBINHold on to my shoulder.

Peter shakes him off.PETERMy mother... my little sister.
         Tell them I love them. Tell them
         I died a free Englishman.
Robin looks despairingly to the Saracen.SARACENHis wound is by the heart.    We
         cannot save him.
Robin knows it's true. Peter pulls an insignia ring from
a hidden pouch in his clothes. Thrusts it into Robin's
hand.PETERTake this to my sister. Swear you
         will protect her for me... Swear
         it, Robin!ROBIN(reluctantly)
         I swear it.
Summoning hidden resources of strength, Peter charges at
the oncoming soldiers, brandishing his sword.PETERFor England.
He fells the first Arab.   The Saracen pulls Robin away.SARACENCome now! Do not fail your friend.
         Make his sacrifice an act of honor.
They vanish into the night. Fighting like a man pos-
sessed, Peter is swallowed in a sea of enemy soldiers.7.DESERTED ALLEY - LATERRobin and the Saracen catch their breath.ROBINFarewell, friend. God speed you
            on your way.SARACENOur way is together. With the
            speed of Allah.
He grins.    This strange man has a sense of humor.ROBINI go to England.SARACENThen I go to England.ROBINEngland?   Why?SARACENYou saved my life. I must stay
            with you until I save yours.ROBINGo your own way. I relieve you of
            your obligation.SARACENOnly Allah can do that.ROBINAnd if I don't want you?SARACENYou have no choice... unless you
            think you can kill me.
He grins broadly.      Offers his hand.SARACENMy name is Aslan.
Resigned, Robin takes the proferred hand.ROBINRobin of Locksley. You know a
            short route to England, Aslan?CUT TO:8.EXT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE (NOTTINGHAMSHIRE, ENGLAND)Eerie shapes. Weaving. White light on water. The moon
reflected in the moat of a small castle. Towers shrouded
in night mist. Smoke curls from a chimney.SUPERIMPOSE:   LOCKSLEY CASTLE, NOTTINGHAMSHIRE, ENGLANDINT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE - NIGHTFIRE CRACKLES in an open hearth. Hams and a half sheep
hang, smoking. An old DOG SNORES at the fireside. A
bone clunks on the floor, waking him.VOICE (O.S.)Enough of that din, Remus.    I
         can't think.
Licking the bone gratefully, the dog looks in the direc-
tion of the voice... Grey. Proud. Distinguished. LORDLOCKSLEY.Seated at a table, wine goblet in hand, he pores   over a
wonderful illustrated Bible. Reading to himself    for
solace and strength. Empty chairs surround the    vast
table. A deep sense of loneliness. He glances     at a
portrait over the fireplace... Robin.
The dog jumps. Hackles rise. O.S. SHOUTS. Locksley
unsheathes a dagger. Obscures it in the folds of the
Bible. The door bursts open. A peasant, ragged,
desperate, KENNETH.KENNETHMy Lord!   Help me.
He's bleeding from a face wound. Another man grabs him
from behind. Locksley's craggy-faced retainer, DUNCAN.
Older than his master, but still strong, he holds Kenneth
back.DUNCANYou must wait... I am sorry you
         were disturbed, Master.KENNETH(high anxiety)
         My Lord, please!LOCKSLEYIt is alright, Duncan.
                (to Kenneth)
         You are Kenneth of Cowfall?
The peasant falls to his knees.(CONTINUED)9.CONTINUED:KENNETHThey've taken my Gwen.    My
         daughter.LOCKSLEYWho has taken her?KENNETHMen on horses. In masks.
                (touches his wound)
         We tried to stop them. My son is
         dead.EXT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE - NIGHTSteam pours from the nostrils of a black charger. Lord
Locksley mounts, in armor. Duncan attempts to detain
him.DUNCANYou cannot go alone, Master.      Let
         me ride for help.LOCKSLEYThat may be too late. Kenneth,
         lead the way.
He kicks his horse into motion.DUNCANMaster, stay!    There is an evil
         moon tonight.LOCKSLEYGood will overcome, Duncan.      Trust
         in that.
Duncan looks up.    Crosses himself.    Dark clouds race
across the moon.CUT TO:EXT. WOODED TRAILKenneth checks the ground.    Locksley waits.KENNETHThey came this way, my Lord.LOCKSLEYOnward then.    What is this place?(CONTINUED)10.CONTINUED:KENNETHNearby the Gregor Caves.
Locksley reacts -- a hint of fear. They move on...
Ahead, the hillside glows, rimmed in eerie light.
Strange primitive CHANTS, wafted on the wind. Locksley
ties his nervous horse to a tree.
Parting undergrowth, Kenneth creeps forward. Cries out.
He's face to face with the maggot-eaten skull of a goat.
Beyond it, a gruesome host of half-skinned human skulls,
all arranged on stakes. Some male, others with rotting
female tresses, staring eyelessly into the night.
Kenneth turns to run... A hand grabs him.LOCKSLEYSteady, man. They are to dissuade
         the faint of heart. Think of
         Gwen.
From the crest of the rise, they peer down into the
craggy valley. A cave opening, ablaze with flames leers
at them like the mouth of hell. Before the cave, a
circle of stones. A miniature Stonehenge.
A medieval orgy. Men and women in masks and loose
robes. Dancing. Drinking. Reveling. Pure carnality.
Lord Locksley and Kenneth watch in horror. Faces ashen.KENNETHDruids.LOCKSLEYI trusted we were rid of such evil
         a century ago.

An unearthly SCREECH. A creature leaps into the circle
of stones. Grotesque gargoyle head, horns, fur-covered
arms and legs. A living Hieronymous Bosch DEMON. Its
clawed hands slash across a reveler's back, drawing
blood in vicious streaks. The creature tastes the blood.
The reveler is ecstatic.KENNETH(petrified)
         Is it the devil?LOCKSLEYIf it is, I have some Christian
         steel that will test his hide.
He draws his sword. A crucifix sculpted into the hilt.
A girl is dragged from the cave. Kenneth buries his
head.(CONTINUED)11.CONTINUED:LOCKSLEYGwen?
Kenneth nods.
The Demon shrieks, dervishing around GWEN, who  is
carried onto the central plinth stone. A pagan   altar,
the shape of an elephant's head with its trunk  raised. A
masked figure stands at the head of the altar.   The high
priest of the dark rite.
The girl's body shudders as blood-red liquid is forced
down her throat. The Demon's voice is husky and hideous.DEMONCome, my virgin flower.
Hypnotized by the creature's voice and snake-like move-
ments, Gwen stretches herself out. A single beam of
sunlight slices through the mist, like a laser. The
first light of the rising sun, it strikes directly on the
altar, tracking down towards the girl's heart. The
Demon's raised talons close in on the white flesh of her
neck. Gwen's eyes are open wide, in a trance. The crowd
of revelers encircle the plinth. Awed anticipation...
A warrior's yell!
Sword raised, Locksley THUNDERS in on his CHARGER. The
terrified crowd parts. The Demon screams like a banshee.DEMONKill him!   Kill him!
The followers throw themselves at   Locksley. He beats
them off. The high priest issues    orders to armed guards,
who run to intercept. One aims a    spear. Locksley hacks
the shaft in half. Cuts men down    left and right.
Reaches the altar stone.LOCKSLEYGwen!   Up, girl, up!
Gwen shakes off her trance. The Demon launches itself at
Locksley. Talons rip flesh from his face. With all his
strength, Locksley hurls the creature down.LOCKSLEYIn the name of God!
His broadsword swings in a mighty arc. Slices across the
gargoyle's skull. Clean through half the face...
Impossibly, the demon rolls back to its feet.(CONTINUED)12.CONTINUED:The head is an elaborate mask -- beneath are the yellow
skin, white hair, and burning red eyes of an albino
crone. Screaming vitriol, the hag is unharmed.
Momentarily stunned, Locksley regains his senses, hauls
the girl onto his charger. The guards close in.
Locksley spurs his horse. Rides for an opening.
The masked high priest stands resolutely in his path.
Brandishing a burning branch. The horse is freaked.
Rears. Locksley and the girl are thrown.
Unarmed, Locksley charges the man. Slams him into the
cave wall. The mask falls. Locksley gasps in
recognition.LOCKSLEYNottingham!
The SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM. Powerful build, black beard,
cruel intensity in every feature.NOTTINGHAMYou are an unwelcome surprise,
         Locksley.LOCKSLEYThe King shall hear of this,
         Nottingham.NOTTINGHAMI think not.
Locksley is surrounded. One by one the men reveal their
faces. Locksley backs up in shock, recognizing them.LOCKSELYGod help us.NOTTINGHAMOne day all England will worship
         with us.LOCKSLEYNever.
The crone spits venom in his face.DEMONI am Mortianna. You will die with
         my name on your lips.
Locksley's agonized cry fills the valley. On the hill-
side, Kenneth averts his eyes. Turns to run. Five
masked figures block his way.13.EXT. ENGLISH SHORE - DAYA twelfth century French sailboat at anchor.    A cross on
its sail.
A longboat rows to shore. Robin stands in the prow, in
a pilgrim's hooded robe. He gazes at the approaching
land. Unable to wait, he leaps into the surf and wades
to the beach. He kneels, pressing his hands and face
into the soil.ROBINHome.    Thank you, Lord.
Aslan steps from the boat, sniffing the air. The French
sailors keep their distance from him. Robin takes his
hand.ROBINMy friend, you have escorted me
         home. I beg you to free yourself
         of your vow. Return with the
         boat. I know how heavy your
         heart must be, this far from your
         family and native land...ASLAN (SARACEN)Because I love them so dearly,
         I cannot dishonor them.
A sailor creeps up behind Aslan, club in hand.ROBINI thought you'd say that.
He nods to the sailor, who swings the club down. The
Saracen sidesteps, grabs the man's arm and flips him
into the surf. He turns a cold stare on Robin.ASLANNo man controls my destiny.
         Especially not one who attacks
         downwind and stinks of garlic.
Robin laughs.    The Saracen remains intense.ASLANIf our positions were reversed,
         I would have done the same.
         Only I would have succeeded.
He smiles broadly.    Robin claps him on the shoulder.ROBINCome, Aslan. By nightfall we will
         celebrate your honor when we dine
         with my father.14.EXT./INT. PEASANT'S COTTAGE - DAYCRASH! An armored foot splinters the door of a farmer's
hovel. Children scream and run. A soldier clubs at
them, laughing.
Outside. More soldiers. Some on horses, others on foot,
with leashed hounds. Pillaging. Vandalizing.
Searching.
GUY GISBORNE: An impressive figure on horseback.
Strikingly handsome -- except that one of his ears is
missing. We recognize his face from the Druid ceremony.
He coldly addresses a pregnant woman with a child in her
arms, FANNY.GISBORNEYou owe the sheriff three bushels
         of flax.FANNYYou starve us. First the drought,
         now you take what food we have
         left.GISBORNEFor starving people, you look
         fat enough.SOLDIER(emerging from
                 the hut)
         He's not here, sir. None but the
         woman and children.GISBORNE(to Fanny)
         Where is your mate? The man
         they call Little.FANNYHe died last winter.GISBORNEIs that so? We hear he     is very
         much alive. Hiding out     in the
         forest. He probably ran     away
         to escape your scolding    tongue.
The soldiers join in his laughter. Incensed, Fanny
pounds her fist on his legs. Gisborne kicks her down.FANNYNorman swine!
A BOY of 12 springs from nowhere, thrusting a hay fork at
Gisborne's throat.(CONTINUED)15.CONTINUED:FANNYNo, Wulf! Don't! 'Twill only
         make it worse.
Wulf backs off.   Nostrils flaring with repressed hate.GISBORNESeize him!
While two soldiers grab the Boy, others examine his
hiding place. A secret thatched door, built into the
side of a haystack... a bow and quiver... and a deer
carcass. Gisborne dismounts.GISBORNEThis is Lord Nottingham's deer.
         Is this how you repay the Sheriff
         for his protection?WULF (BOY)Like a wolf protects sheep.FANNYI killed it.   We needed the meat.GISBORNEPoachers hang. Either he dies or
         you die.WULFMy mother lies to protect me.FANNYNo, Wulf!
Gisborne drags the boy to the carcass.GISBORNEYou have deprived us of a hunt,
         boy.
He cups his hand in the deer's blood.    Smears it on
Wulf's face.GISBORNEThe hounds know the scent well.
He tosses his bloody glove to the dogs. They tear at
each other in their effort to rip at the glove.GISBORNERun, boy. Like a deer. Give us
         some pleasure before you die.(CONTINUED)16.CONTINUED:To the accompaniment of the HOUNDS' savage HOWLS and
the horrified screams of his family, Wulf runs.GISBORNEUnleash them!EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DUSKNearing home, Robin is buoyant.     The Saracen, brooding,
walks two paces behind him.ROBINWhy must you walk in back of me?ASLANIn your land am I not the infidel?
         The unbeliever, the instrument of
         evil?ROBINOur races have fought for a
         hundred years to prove that point.ASLANThen I trust it is safer to appear
         as your slave than as your equal.ROBINFor an 'infidel' you have uncommon
         clarity of thinking. Yet you
         refuse to tell me about your home
         and family.ASLANThose are my burdens.ROBINYou speak my language. You have
         the diplomacy and honor code of
         a nobleman. I ask again, why
         were you to be executed?
The Saracen maintains a moody silence.ROBINSo, I must continue with my
         guesswork. You are highborn?
         Probably... You fell from favor...
         Clearly... Why? You broke the
         law? You were a rival for power?
         ... A woman?(CONTINUED)17.CONTINUED:The Saracen reacts, almost imperceptibly.ROBINBy the Lord, that's it!
Aslan is silent, but Robin knows he's right.ROBINThey say there are Arab women of
            such beauty that they can possess
            a man's mind, that he would be
            willing to die for them. Is
            that not so?
Ignoring him, the Saracen stops.      Examines the darkening
sky.ASLANIt is close to sunset.ROBINYour people must marry women
            chosen for them by others, right?
No reply.    Aslan unfolds a prayer rug.ROBINWho is she? The Mullah's daughter?
            ... Another man's wife?... That's
            it!ASLANEndless clouds. Is there no sun
            in your cursed country?ROBINYou dog! You painted old dog!
            What is her name?ASLANWhich way is East?ROBINHer name?ASLANEast?ROBINHer name?ASLANEast?!!!
Robin folds his arms.    A standoff.(CONTINUED)18.CONTINUED:ASLANDamn you!... Jasmina.ROBINAh, Jasmina!    Is she beautiful?ASLANWhich way is East?ROBINThat way.
Aslan throws his rug on the ground.    Kneels.ASLANAre you sure?ROBINI would know blindfolded. I'm
         five miles from home... Was she
         worth it?ASLANWorth dying for.
Robin stands smiling over him as Aslan begins his
prayers... BAYING of HUNTING DOGS... In the distance, the
boy Wulf runs toward them, ducks behind a tree and clubs
the leading dog with a branch. The other hounds close
in... panting with exhaustion, Wulf swings into the
branches. A hound savages his leg.
The soldiers surround the tree. The boy clambers
precariously onto the highest branch... Robin surrep-
titiously steals a crossbow from one of the soldiers'
horses.GISBORNEYou're not playing by    the rules,
         boy. Deer don't climb     trees...
         Perhaps he thinks he's    a game
         bird. Shall we teach     him to fly?
         Cut it down!
The soldiers hack at the trunk.    The tree quivers.ROBINHold!... I am curious as to what
         manner of creature is so fearsome
         that it takes six men to attack
         it.
Shrouded in his pilgrim's hooded cloak, he approaches
them.(CONTINUED)19.CONTINUED:GISBORNEStand back, stranger. This is no
         affair of yours.ROBINHave we treed the devil himself?
         Let me see... Ah ha! A small boy.
         A truly dangerous animal.GISBORNEI advise you to move on, pilgrim.
         This is the Sheriff's land.ROBINWrong. This is my land, and my
         tree. Therefore, whatever is in
         it also belongs to me.GISBORNEI grow dangerously tired of your
         wit... Chop it down!ROBINThe man who strikes that tree
         dies.
He glances nervously at Aslan, who's still at his
prayers. The men stop in mid-swing. More surprised
than scared. Gisborne gestures to the largest of them.GISBORNEChop down the hooded fool.ROBIN(backing up)
         Perhaps we could discuss this.

The soldier raises his sword. Robin lifts his cape...
the crossbow. Shoots from the hip. The bolt thuds

            I have four of them cornered.
The Saracen remains head down. Or did we see him steal
a glance? Gisborne signals his men to attack. A wave of
flashing steel.ROBINI hope there's enough of me to
            satisfy you all.
Backed up to a tree, he grabs a branch and kicks out.
Two men fly back. He lunges at a third. His sword
strikes flesh. Robin sidesteps and hurls the fourth
onto a sharp tree stump.
Gisborne thrusts. Robin reacts too slowly.       Blood flows
from his arm. His sword falls.ROBINAslan!!
Gisborne is on him, sword pressed to his back.      Robin
freezes.GISBORNEWell, hooded stranger, allow me
            to know your name before I run you
            through.

A moment of silence... Like lightning, Robin spins,
kicks out Gisborne's legs. Slams one foot on the man's
sword arm, the other on his throat. Throws back his
pilgrim's hood.GISBORNERobin of Locksley!ROBINOn your knees, Gisborne.   Pray.

Heavy scorn. The sheriff pats Gisborne's hand like a

Robin reaches into the branches. Pulls out a string of
hollowed wooden tubes -- WINDCHIMES. Dozens of such
strings on all the trees. He blows over the hollow end.
A low chilling MOAN.ROBINHere are your ghosts, Duncan. A
         child's toy put to good use. You
         scare easily, my painted Saladin.
His laughter is broken by a piercing YELL. A red-
jacketed figure swings down out of a tree on a rope.
Catapults him to the ground.
The bushes are instantly alive. Shaggy, wild-eyed men,
armed with cudgels, scythes and hayforks. Twelfth-

Robin looks up... I mean up! A towering figure. Seven
feet of grinning, muscled brute. The giant extends a
vice that passes for a hand. Hauls Robin to his feet.

lunges for Robin's wrist. Wrenches the sword free.

bridge.JOHN LITTLEAlright, m'old cock. You wanna

His confidence melting, Robin glances back at Duncan
and Aslan, who grins like a fan at a boxing match. John
storms at Robin. Staffs thrash. Driven back, Robin
connects a blow on John's foot.
The giant is off-balance. Robin follows up. Lands a
couple to the ribs. John responds with heavy swings,
which Robin blocks deftly. Back and forth, blow for
blow, all blocked. John chuckles with every swing.
Enjoying the time of his life.
Their staffs lock. It's strength against strength.
Robin is no match. With one mighty thrust, John
hurtles him into the stream. The woodsmen cheer loudly.
Aslan watches impassively.

grinning.JOHN LITTLELil' wet behind the ears, mate?WILL SCARLETDon't fool with him. Get him!

John charges. Robin fends him off, gets in some shots
of his own. John swings in a giant arc. Robin ducks.
John loses balance and falls to his knees. Robin allows
him time to right himself.

the impact. Brute force versus agility. Agility is
beginning to prevail, when Robin's staff splits in two.JOHN LITTLESwimmin' time again, ol' chum.

         I am ready, Will.
Will bends, as if checking the horse's legs. Secretly
grabs a handful of sand. Swings into the saddle and digs
in his heels.
Closing in, Will flings the sand in Robin's eyes. Robin
clutches his hands to his face, blinded. Will spins
back to the attack.
His sword slashes. Reacting to the sound, Robin rolls
aside. The men cheer like a big fight crowd.

Robin's POV is blurred. Ducking the blade, he grabs
Will's arm. A blow glances off his shoulder.
Robin falls to his knees, still blinded. Will rides
right at him, to trample him. Robin scrambles away.
Will wheels his horse. A flashing hoof grazes Robin's
chest.
Robin leaps to his feet and yells at the top of his
lungs. Panicked, the HORSE rears, WHINNYING wildly.
Will struggles to stay in the saddle. Loses his sword.

and weaves, easily evading Will's repeated charges.
Robin ducks right under the horse's belly.ROBINHere, Will!   You aim like a girl,
         Will!
Will stabs wildly, more and more frustrated. Laughter
spreads, as Robin plays hide and seek around the horse's
legs. Grabbing the end of the spear, he clowns a tug
of war.
Enraged, Will strains and tries to kick Robin away.
Suddenly, Robin lets go. Unbalanced, Will flies back-
wards off his mount.
Robin snatches the spear and raises it over his fallen
adversary. The crowd falls silent. Robin strikes. The
point quivers in the ground below Will's crotch. Will
wriggles in terror. Impaled, his pants rip open.ROBINThank the Lord you are not endowed
         like Bull.

breath. Does not see Will, who grabs a heavy staff and

Together they run down the hill, keeping low.
Gisborne eyes the forest. The beer cart is steered by a
fat red-faced FRIAR, raucously singing hymns and quaffing
from a jug, which he repeatedly dips into one of the
barrels.
ARROWS WHISTLE in. The Friar yells and drops his jug. A
soldier is hit. At the forest edge, four woodsmen reload
their longbows. Dressed in green, their faces
camouflaged.
The mounted soldiers charge them. The  woodsmen run into
the trees. As the horsemen close in,  the runners leap
into a trench. Lift up matted screens  of brush and
grass. It's as if they disappeared.   The soldiers slash
wildly at the thick screens.
More arrows fly. More soldiers fall. The others spin
in confusion, trying to discern the enemy. More woods-
men break from cover. Run down a narrow path. Gisborne
urges his men to pursue. They ride in single file,
beating their way through the tangled branches.

The runners dive into the trees, as other men haul on
ropes, raising a giant screen in the soldiers' path. The
horses swerve, on the edge of a twenty-foot drop to the
river gorge. Momentum  carries many of them over the
cliff.BACK ON ROADWAYRobin and Aslan swing down from the trees onto the tax
wagon. Kick down the two drivers and take the reins,
steering the wagon off the road. The archers inside are
unable to fire at them.
Little John leaps onto the beer cart, sending the Friar
hurtling back among the barrels. The Friar slams his
head and drops unconscious. John whips the horse,
driving the cart after Robin. Another camouflage screen
is lifted into place, covering their route.(CONTINUED)66.CONTINUED:Gisborne races back to the road... the wagons are gone.

his feet.ROBINAh, I feared as much.
He signals to Aslan, who steers the tax wagon into the
river. Water floods in through the slits. Inside,

Both banks are men in green, longbows aimed directly at
them.CUT TO:COUNTRYSIDESparks. An axe pounds into the lock of a strongbox. The

Smites Robin with it.(CONTINUED)68.CONTINUED:FRIAR... you must best me for it.
Robin staggers. The Friar whips up the horse. Dazed,
Robin grabs for the fat man's leg. Gets a holy sandal
full in the face.FRIARGiddyup, nag!
The Friar's horse, as obese as his driver, slowly raises
his head from the grass and ambles forward. Robin runs
after them and dives at the Friar, toppling him from the
cart.ROBINYou leave when I say.
Scrambling to his feet, the Friar glances skyward.FRIARProtect me, Lord.
He sweeps his foot, knocking Robin's legs out from under
him. Hurls his full body weight on top of him. Whooomf!FRIARYield!
He bounces on Robin's stomach. Robin can barely breathe.

Aslan and the Chieftain are locked in mortal combat.
Aslan stumbles back and falls. The Chieftain swipes at
his head. Aslan rolls aside. The sword smashes wood.

soldier, takes his sword, and whirls back at the
Chieftain. His blows have no effect on the Scot's black
armor.
The Sheriff rears his horse... hooves flail.. knocking
Will to his knees. The Sheriff lunges... Desperate, Will
grasps the sword, ignoring the pain... a tug of war.
Blood pours from Will's hands, where the blade cuts in.
He suddenly lets go... Nottingham topples from his
horse. Will leaps on him.(CONTINUED)119.CONTINUED:WILL SCARLETPain or death, you butcher?
The Sheriff's men drag Will off before he can choke him.
Raging, Nottingham climbs to his feet. Will is held by
four men.NOTTINGHAMHere's another message to Robin
         Hood, written in your blood.
He drives his sword repeatedly, insanely, into Will's
belly.WILL SCARLETIt's over, fool. You can kill my
         body, but you cannot kill our
         spirit.
He finally drops... Nottingham heads for the castle.
Robin attempts to follow. He swings from the noose,
using the rope to vault over the surrounding soldiers.
As he lands, he is waylaid by one of the barons and his
men.REDHEAD BARONIt's Hood!   Get him!
The Chieftain knocks Aslan down.   Aslan loses his sword.CHIEFTAINI am iron.   I am rock. I am your
         death.
Aslan spots one of John's arrows protruding from a dead
Celt's back. Scrambles over and tears it out.ASLANYou talk too much!
He leaps... rams the arrow through the Chieftain's
mouthpiece... out the back of his neck. The Chieftain
grabs his helmet, trying to rip it off. He topples,
his life's blood gushing from both sides of his neck.
Aslan plants a foot on the slain warrior.ASLANEnglishmen! I am not one of you,
         yet I fight for you. Against a
         tyrant. Join me now. Join Robin
         Hood.

soldiers, many join the fray.(CONTINUED)120.CONTINUED:Nottingham runs through the castle gate.   Angry peasants
pursue.NOTTINGHAMLower the portcullis! Now!
A guard winds down the giant gate.   Nottingham hurls him
aside.NOTTINGHAMToo slow, fool!
He hacks at the ropes. The gate slices down like a
guillotine, pinning soldiers and peasants alike.

Fighting his way towards the gate, Robin sees   with dismay
that the portcullis is closed. Weakening, he    staves off
the redhead baron's vicious assault. Suddenly    peasants
are swarming over his attacker. The baron is    dragged off
and trampled down.ROBINFriends!   We must raise the gate.EXT. CASTLE PARAPET - DAYCrossbow bolts fly. Little John ducks and weaves, while

his sword.LITTLE JOHNExcuse me, m 'old cock. Ya mind

three attackers. He swings a soldier around. Holds him
as a shield, using the man's own sword against his
companions. In seconds, all three are down and Robin is
off and running.
Down corridors, searching. Soldiers and armed servants
converge to block his way. Robin strikes, vaults, flings
statues. Up the stairs... topples a suit of armor down
on his pursuers.ROBIN(grabbing a servant)

Robin backs in, bloodied, fencing with four remaining
soldiers. He smashes one by swinging the heavy door into
him, hurtles a pew at another. He springs off another
pew, taking down a third.ROBINMarian, run!   It's me, Robin.
         Run!
Marian remains immobile. Mortianna moves to her side.
Robin is struck in the thigh. Like a vulture, the
Sheriff waits. Tiring, blood pouring from his leg, Robin
prepares to fight him.(CONTINUED)124.CONTINUED:ROBINI warned you, I would find you no

Aslan spins... too late. Screeching, Mortianna drives
the spear into Aslan's side. He cries out and slides to
the floor.
Nottingham uses Robin's distraction to regain his sword.
Back on the defensive, Robin tries to evade the blows.
Mortianna drags Marian out onto a balcony. Robin cannot
pursue. In acute pain, Aslan struggles to his feet.
Grasping the spear where it enters his side, he pulls with
all his strength.
The Bishop, concealed dagger in hand, approaches Tuck.BISHOP(innocently)

temple.  The Sheriff hits the floor. Robin grabs his
father's sword. Raises it two-fisted. Nottingham tries
to squirm away.ROBINThis is for my father.
