                                            Final Script
                                       November 11, 2009INT. PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM - DAYThe flicker of film.   Footage from a press conference.GUIDOYou kill your film several times,
            mostly by talking about it. A film is
            a dream. You kill it writing it down,
            you kill it with a camera; the film
            might come to life for a moment or two
            when your actors breathe life back
            into it - but then it dies again,
            buried in film cans. Mysteriously,
            sometimes, in the editing room, a
            miracle happens when you place one
            image next to another so that when,
            finally, an audience sits in the dark,
            if you're lucky -- very lucky - and
            sometimes I've been lucky - the dream
            flickers back to life again. That's
            why I'm secretive.REPORTER (O.S.)So what's your favorite pasta?GUIDOFinally, a serious question.

Laughter.   A word:NINEINT. STAGE 5, CINECITTA - NIGHTA huge soundstage. The STUDIO SUPERINTENDENT lets a
man into the stage, turns on a working light.

SUPERTITLE: Cinecitta film studios, Rome, 1965STUDIO SUPERINTENDENTGood luck, Maestro.

Departing, he closes the soundstage door.

As the man crosses the shadowy stage, a dim shaft of
light catches his face, weary, handsome, haggard.
GUIDO CONTINI, the most famous film director in the
world. In front of him:

AN ENORMOUS, DUSTY, MULTI-LEVEL FILM SET under
construction. A complex maze of scaffolding, its
unfinished, chaotic elements suggesting ancient ruins.
Cracked stone facades, broken columns, open
platforming, the skeleton of a grand staircase.    A
lighting grid, not yet hung, and a camera crane
surrounded by a forest of studio lights on stands.
                                    p. 2



Guido sits at the table, lights up a cigarette and puts
on his glasses. He looks at the plans, looks up at the
stage, puts his glasses down and stands up, stepping
over to the crane.

Guido, alone, cigarette hanging from the corner of his
mouth, contemplates the studio, its turbulent set, in
every sense a jumble of ideas.

Guido looks at the set in despair. He sits in the
bucket seat of the crane, buries his head in his hands,
overwhelmed.THE FIRST OF NINE LOUD CHURCH BELLS CHIMESGUIDO (V.O.)Maestro, Maestro, Maestro Contini...
          How do you begin? How do you begin
          this thing? Page 1... Page 1... Page
          1... Page nothing...

In the distance, a figure approaches out of the
darkness, the darkness of Guido's imagination. An
escape from his tortured reality.

The figure emerges gradually, like a goddess. She is
gorgeous, imposing, and seductive. She is CLAUDIA, his
film star, his muse. When Claudia reaches Guido, she
stops in front of him, takes his hands from his face,
and kisses him. And with that gesture, the music
swells, the lighting grid rises majestically into the
air, the gritty soundstage transforms into something
beautiful, transforms into the interior world ofGUIDO'S FANTASY.As Claudia moves away, more and more women slowly
appear. They emerge from everywhere. These are the
women from Guido's life, past and present. Women from
his films, women he has loved, the sources of his
inspiration and creative genius.

A grand OVERTURE unfolds. The most significant women
in Guido's life are revealed, each with their own
powerful entrance:

LUISA, his wife

CARLA, his mistress

LILLI, his costume designer and accomplice

GUIDO'S MAMMA, her spirit

STEPHANIE, a fashion journalist

SARAGHINA, a whore
                                       p. 3



A dark and glamourous dream. The women surround Guido
and he loses himself and his anxiety in their
collective embrace.INT. STAGE 5, CINECITTA - DAYThe fantasy ends abruptly with A VIOLENT GRATING NOISE,
as the studio's truck doors are yanked open, jolting
Guido who is slumped in the crane seat. Harsh daylight
penetrates the gloom. Too bright. He blinks,
discombobulated, as a group of silhouetted figures
approach with purpose. One of the figures is a well-
fed, amiable character, DANTE. He is Guido's longtime
associate and Producer. A younger, more ascetic figure
accompanies him, sharp and birdlike. This is FAUSTO, an
accountant. Dante speaks quickly and without obvious
punctuation:DANTE(walking)
          Guido! You're here.GUIDOBuongiorno, Dante.DANTEI've been looking for you all over the
          place. The set's coming along. How
          are you?GUIDOBene, grazie, bene.

Guido stands to greet him. They kiss on both cheeks.DANTEBene. My God, you look terrible,
          better go to makeup, forget you've got
          a press conference?FAUSTO(discreetly, to Dante)
          He has no tie.DANTEYes, makeup and wardrobe.

He takes Guido's arm and they head towards daylight.
Guido looks back at Fausto, who follows and with a look
and a gesture asks Dante who is he?FAUSTO(overlapping Dante)
          Signor Contini, I'm Fausto.     Good
          morning, Signor Contini.
                                       p. 4DANTE(interrupts)
          He's counting costs, you know. The
          Bank wants him here.
                 (to Fausto)
          Don't speak to him, I speak to him.FAUSTOOkay, I have some questions for Signor
          Contini.GUIDOWe all have questions for Signor
          Contini.

They head outside.EXT. CINECITTA - DAYGuido, Dante and Fausto hurry through the studio en
route to the Production Offices. Behind them is a large
poster of CLAUDIA, starring in Guido's last movie, a
failure, LA DONNA MODERNA (The Modern Woman). As Guido
passes he causes a mild stir, and many people nod
deferentially, offer a Maestro, or Dottore. Guido nods.FAUSTOYes, but please, please, I think it's
          customary for there to be an approved
          script and budget before filming
          commences...GUIDOIs he going to follow us?FAUSTOIt's not my intention to be difficult.
          Maestro, I am a huge admirer of
          Maestro Contini's movies, your early
          films are...everybody loves them
          and... I consider it a great honour
          for me to be here now... none the
          less, I need a script and a budget.

Neither Dante nor Guido respond. Fausto flounders.
They make their way to the Production Offices.
Everywhere signs for the movie, ITALIA.INT. PRODUCTION OFFICES, CINECITTA - DAYA long corridor, bustling with activity. The trio
heads down it. If a pretty girl goes by, and there are
several, both Guido and Dante turn to look but without
missing a beat of their solemn conversation.
                                       p. 5


As they progress into and through the open plan office,
many of the crew look up and cluster around, trying to
get Guido's attention, swelling the procession,
interjecting with their urgent requests.

There are set models everywhere, in the process of
being constructed, or painted.

JACONELLI, Guido's production designer, looks up from a
model, hurries over. Nobody stops moving.

As a pretty girl passes between them, they all turn to
look.

PIERPAOLO, Guido's young PA, has caught up with the
procession. He has dozens of phone messages, sorting
through them, as he walks alongside Guido, through a
partitioned office -PIERPAOLOWhere do you want your messages?GUIDOOn my desk.PIERPAOLOThere's no room on your desk.

- into the main office -GUIDOUnder my desk. In the trash. Non lo
          so.PIERPAOLO(waving them at him)
          Some of these are urgent!GUIDO(to Pierpaolo)
          Get me a cigarette.JACONELLI(confidentially)
          We will never be ready to shoot in ten
          days.GUIDOJaconelli -FAUSTO(at the same time)
          Not ready?!GUIDO(continues)
          Ascolta me.(MORE)p. 6GUIDO (CONT'D)(he kisses Jaconelli on
                  the cheek)
          Careful what you say. He's a spy from
          the bank.

Guido carries on moving through the office.DANTEHe's not exactly from the bank, Guido.

Now BENITO, Guido's Casting Director, moves towards
Guido, Guido tries to duck away from him as they head
towards Guido's office.BENITODottore, Dottore. You have actors
          waiting for you in your office.
          Auditions all morning. You should see
          what I've found. I found two sisters.
          Look, they're right...

Guido turns through another partition, as they all
besiege him with questions. Benito despairs.BENITO (CONT'D)Dottore, this way...

Guido heads towards Wardrobe, goes straight through the
door, swinging it shut, leaving the chaos behind him.

Dante blocks Benito.BENITO (CONT'D)Maestro!DANTENot now. He's got the Press
          Conference.INT. WARDROBE, CINECITTA - DAYGuido comes through the door, blows hard from the
barrage.

They're in Lilli's domain here, and a haven, always,
for Guido. Part Edith Head, part Coco Chanel, Lilli is
Guido's Costume Designer, no longer young, cranky,
indomitable, sharp as a tack. She adores Guido without
any sentiment. She's incapable of sentiment. Guido
heads straight towards her desk, where she is cutting
some fabric.GUIDOI need a cigarette.

Dante comes in, closing the door behind him.
                                      p. 7DANTEHe needs a shirt and tie, Lilli.

Guido sits up on Lilli's table, as Dante heads to
Lilli's desk and picks up the phone to make a call.GUIDOI need a coffee and a cigarette.

He lies down.LILLI(unimpressed)
          Answer a question, I'll give you a
          coffee. Answer another question, I'll
          give you a cigarette. And so on.GUIDOActually and an aspirin.

Dante stands at Lilli's desk and looks at some
drawings.DANTE(in the background, on the
                  phone)
          We're running late...LILLI(turns to Guido and lights
                  a cigarette)
          Calm down. Directing a movie is a very
          overrated job, we all know it. You
          just have to say yes or no. What else
          do you do? Nothing. Maestro - Should
          this be Red? Yes. Green? No. More
          extras? Yes. More lipstick? No. Yes,
          no, yes, no, yes, no - that's
          directing.

Lilli hands Guido the lit cigarette.GUIDOThat's right: that's directing. And it
          doesn't seem to make a blind bit of
          difference, finally, what the answer
          is...LILLISo please, Guido, yes or no, do you
          want any costumes in this film?GUIDOYes.
                                      p. 8LILLIYou see - simple!
                 (handing him an espresso
                  fetched by her assistant,ROBERTA)Might I know what period the movie's
          in?

Lilli glances at Dante who has edged closer to the
table, he looks at the costumes.GUIDOYes, yes.
                 (downs the espresso)
          Soon.

Lilli glares at Dante, ushering him away.LILLIYou know I don't allow producers in
          here.DANTEAlright. Two minutes Guido.

Lilli is the only person who intimidates Dante. He
leaves. Guido pulls out his own tie from his pocket.


Lilli walks round and takes the tie off him. Guido sits
up. Lilli puts the tie round his neck.LILLIHe's gone. Have you written a word of
          the script?GUIDONo.LILLIAre you in a panic?GUIDOYes.

She ties Guido's tie for him.LILLIIs Luisa going with you to the Press
          Conference?GUIDONo. Nobody. Dante.    And his spy.LILLIYou need to shave.    You look terrible.
                                      p. 9GUIDO(looking around,
                  desperate)
          Why is there no fire escape in here?
          What if somebody needed to escape? I
          can't face these reporters. I have
          nothing to say.LILLIYou'll be fine. You're a world class
          liar, darling, go out there and lie
          for Italy, lie for Italia.EXT. ROME - DAYGuido is driving his Roadster   through the streets of
Rome. An Italian pop song of    the day is playing on the
radio as he speeds around the   Piazza del Poppolo. In
front of him in the convoy is   Dante with Fausto.INT. GUIDO'S CAR - DAYAs Guido drives, he turns to see his MAMMA in the
passenger seat. He's not remotely surprised. She
appears the way he remembers her. Mamma is
extraordinary.GUIDOWhat the hell's wrong with me? I
          can't sleep. I can't think. I can't
          write. I can't breathe. My heart is
          racing. Am I dying, Mamma? I owe you
          flowers, I know. I'll come to the
          cemetery at the weekend. You should
          have let me bury you in Roma, Mamma, I
          could visit you every week. Don't
          look at me like that.MAMMA(with kindly patience)
          Oh, Guido, Guido.

He stops at a busy intersection.EXT. STREETS OF ROME / INT. GUIDO'S CAR - DAYThis is the Rome of La Dolce Vita, the Rome of Vespas,
skinny ties, cool sunglasses, impossibly cool young
people. A magnificent fall day, and the cafes are
stuffed with the beautiful and chic.
                                     p. 10MAMMAThis is your Rome, Guido. The world
          sees Rome the way you invented it.
          Your films did that.GUIDO(buoyed by her
                  encouragement)
          I miss you.MAMMAI miss you, too.

Guido is in his own world. The policeman raps on the
bonnet of the car. Guido startles and pulls off, alone
in the car.

Guido looks across as he drives. Mamma has gone.EXT. HOTEL EXCELSIOR, VIA VENETO - DAYThe convoy comes to a quick stop in front of the Hotel
Excelsior on the Via Veneto.

As soon as Guido gets out of the car, the waiting
paparazzi snap his picture. Beautiful women look at
him. Guido moves quickly by them.

Dante and the team hurry after him.   Fausto tackles
Dante.

And they hurry after Guido.INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAYA big suite. About fifty reporters, men and women, are
in the room, and an array of microphones are on a
coffee table next to a long couch. Excited chaos. A
RADIO REPORTER narrates in the background.RADIO REPORTERAnd we're just waiting for the arrival
          of Contini...any moment now - Could
          this film put the Maestro back on top?

A few news cameras are filming.    There's a buffet, and
a bartender.

And Guido comes into the room, shaking hands, patting
shoulders, grabbing a glass of champagne. Dante and the
team follow him in.RADIO REPORTER (CONT'D)And here he is..!
                                   p. 11DANTESilenzio, per favore...Thank you,
          thank you...RADIO REPORTERDante, Guido Contini's long time
          producer, is about to speak...DANTEI want to say a few words from my
          heart. I am humbled and thrilled to
          be able to announce that I am
          producing Guido Contini's next film,
          Italia, which will star once again
          Contini's longtime inspiration, the
          international film star, Claudia
          Jenssen...

A stunning film poster is revealed -- Claudia Jenssen
emerging from the Colosseum: CLAUDIA JENSSEN. UN FILM
DI GUIDO CONTINI. ITALIA. Flashes. Excitement.DANTE (CONT'D)...we start shooting in ten days time
          in Cinecitta. That makes it one week
          from Monday.
                 (to Guido, handing over)
          Thank you, Maestro, thank you very
          much. This is our ninth film
          together. Guido Contini.GUIDOThanks for coming, everybody.

Pretending to leave, he heads towards the exit and
kisses Dante on the cheek.

He returns to the couch. All the reporters fire their
questions at once. The questions come on top of each
other, and Guido covers his despair with an inflated
energy. He takes his sunglasses off and signals to
DINARDO, a harsh-looking woman.DINARDOMaestro Contini. Maestro Contini.GUIDOYes.DINARDOGrazie. Maestro Contini, your new
          film is called Italia... big title.

Another journalist, Leopardi, vile - sitting next to
her, egging Dinardo on - almost sniggers with contempt.
                                      p. 12GUIDOActually, it's my shortest title yet.DINARDOBut hardly a modest one.GUIDOFilms are not modest. They cost too
          much, they take too long, and they
          involve too many people. So they
          should have grand titles.DINARDOAnd might you tell the press what the
          film is about?GUIDOWhy? I still don't know what my last
          film was about.LEOPARDI(In a loud aside to
                  Dinardo)
          That was the problem. Nobody else did.GUIDOOf course I can tell you what my film
          is about...I can tell you the story, I
          can tell you who I am going to cast,
          the music I want to use, I can tell
          you everything... but... I... won't.
          I'm afraid that if I say anything, the
          word might get out to the Press.

General laughter in the room. He wins a round, but is
clearly feeling the strain... Dante recognizes, steps
in.DANTEOur next film will be exactly as it
          sounds. Italia. It's the very spirit
          of Italy - Italy as myth, Italy as a
          woman, Italy as a dream.LEOPARDIIs this true?GUIDOIt sounds fantastic.    I can't wait to
          see it.

He's still winning. Ignoring the question, he points
to STEPHANIE, a gorgeous fashion reporter he recognizes
from American Vogue.   Flirtatious and charming, she
wants him and he senses it.
                                    p. 13STEPHANIESignor Contini.GUIDOStephanie.STEPHANIEGrazie. Could you tell the fashionable

          good?REPORTER TWO (O.S.)(tries to interrupt)
          What do you think of the New Wave in

          movie with your wife, do you plan on
          casting her in this new film?

          I would never again make love to my
          leading lady.REPORTER FOURBut she hasn't worked at all since
          working with you.

Laughter. Everyone starts firing questions at Guido
again. Another REPORTER asks a question.REPORTER FIVEBut why are you being so tight-lipped
          about this film? It's a serious
          question. What's the big deal?

for Guido to keep quiet.GUIDOWhat happened?CARLA(still giggling)

He lies back to write and finds himself in CLAUDIA'S

Young Guido, dressed in his school uniform, runs fast
across the rough dunes with five boys from the village.

The boys head for a graffiti-covered defensive wall
with barbed wire along the top, a leftover from the
war.

They reach into pockets and extract small change, hand
it to Young Guido, already the ring leader.

approach an abandoned bunker...EXT. SARAGHINA'S BUNKER - DAY...Young Guido takes a step forward toward the bunker,

A shadow moves inside the bunker. Now even Young Guido
takes a step back, but the boys are taking three steps
back.

And then she comes out. SARAGHINA is a gritty, earthy
woman, with a powerful, voluptuous energy. She has
darkened eyes and a beauty mark: she is clearly the
model for the whore makeup on Carla.

She looks at the boys. She may be a crazy whore, but
she's not an animal, she's just playing one for the
boys, and they don't quite understand that she's having
her own fun with them.

She takes a deliberate step. Young Guido stands his
ground. She takes another step and holds out her hand.

Young Guido opens his hand with the coins.

She looks at the money.   Is it enough?


But she grabs his wrist, and holds it, and then takes
the coins.

She stuffs the money in her ample bosom and heads back
to her bunker. She returns dragging an old broken
chair, places it in front of the boys and sits, ready
for the "show."

lights are being flown up into the grid, the LOADER is
preparing the Clapper Board. The Loader has created a
slate: ITALIA, CLAUDIA JENSSEN, HAIR AND MAKEUP TESTS.

The gang enters. Guido says a brisk hello to the crew,
then leaves the set quickly. Finds the studio
telephone behind the flats. He dials.

Guido is in a mess.INT. INSERT STAGE - EARLY EVENINGGuido walks forward and sits by the camera, as suddenly
there's a commotion at the studio door, and Lilli and
some of her assistants come through, silhouettes only,
followed by a tall figure, who demands the space around
her. As the others walk towards a holding area with
costumes, and wigs and all manner of items, the woman,
who is CLAUDIA, of course, simply walks into the light,
her home, and stands there waiting for Guido.

She looks stunning and glamorous. The epitome of a
Sixties movie star. Guido gets up and approaches
Claudia.

Pierpaolo acts as First Assistant Director.PIERPAOLOSilence please. Se gira. And we are
          rolling.

Guido gets behind the camera and films Claudia's test.GUIDOCould you turn to the right please,

Makeup artists and costume assistants immediately
surround her, loosening her hair.

Dante is thrilled. Fausto is also mesmerised.    She's a
star, that's the long and short of it.

open. The paparazzi are in waiting and swarm the car,
flashbulbs popping, men clambering onto the car for a
picture of the Star driving away with her Director.
Lots of shouting and pleas, lots of remonstration from
Guido. They drive away, and are immediately followed
by a posse of photographers on their mopeds and Vespas
and little cars.INT. CAR, ROME OUTSKIRTS - NIGHTGuido's Roadster roars away, the papparazzi posse
following.   Guido glances at Claudia, loves having her
in the car, she's such a class act. He's always
inspired. He's driving fast but distracted by her.GUIDOYou look ravishing.CLAUDIAYou're not seeing me, you're seeing
          Lilli's wigs and makeup, I'm somewhere
          hidden underneath.

Guido's a good driver and weaves in and out of the
traffic. So do the posse, but as the road opens up,
they can't keep up with him and he manages to overtake
a car, they speed after him.EXT. MEDIEVAL LANES, TRASTEVERE - NIGHTGuido stops the car by some narrow streets in the
Trastevere, just south of the Vatican. They watch the
photographers hurtle past in search of them.

Guido is exasperated.GUIDOWhy is everybody so suddenly obsessed
          with the script?

Claudia listens. She's always seduced by the way he
speaks, his passion. They fall in love with each other
in every movie, that's the way of it. Guido lights a
cigarette.GUIDO (CONT'D)Talk to the people who love you in our

down, the synch pop on 3, and Claudia appears on the

The reel finishes. The lights come up, to excited
chatter, he looks at Lilli a row or two behind him, she
shrugs sympathetically.

back to look at the screen.

During the reel, Dante is very decisive... shouts out,
as the women appear.

They come on, one after the other, say their names.
Guido gives them things to do.   Pick up the phone and
argue with your lover. No, make him laugh. Make him
want you.   Walk towards the camera as if you were
frightened. As if you were angry. ON ELEANORA - very
angry on the phone:BENITOIf we like her, we have to call her
          agent right away. Everybody wants her
          right now.DANTEWell they can keep her.BENITOShe's a very funny actress.DANTEShe's peculiar. You don't like her
          Guido?

Next actress: ILARIA. Someone comes in the door.
Guido turns and sees it's Luisa, sitting next to Lilli.
She's come. He turns back to the screen.

Another actress appears. It's Donatella. Very
nervous. She says her name. Guido instructs her.     She
tries the phone, the walks. She's not a natural.

Luisa finds the gentle humor in this situation. She
looks at Guido. A little smile. He feels it like
sunshine. He turns back to the screen.DANTE (CONT'D)She's nice.FAUSTOShe's very natural.DANTEEven better. She's a bit nervous
          here. What do you say, Guido?
          Donatella's nice?

Another girl: ALESSIA. Very striking. Keeps looking
out past the camera, getting sotto voce instructions
from Guido. Her hair is in a chignon. She begins her
improv, but Guido interrupts her, suddenly appears in
front of the camera. Approaches her, and undoes the
chignon, freeing her hair. She's beautiful and
innocent. Guido says something to her, a whisper. But
what he says and how he says it, the smile it provokes,
goes like a dagger to Luisa.

As the reel finishes... and the lights come up.DANTE (CONT'D)I don't know what Guido thinks. I

The screening room empties, a lot of mutual
congratulations on good work, especially to Lilli, and
a hug or a handshake from almost everybody for Luisa.

and head down the street.EXT. ANGUILLARA STREETS - DAYGuido and Lilli walk along the waterfront.   People pass
by occasionally. They talk -LILLII'm glad she's acting again. I made
          her costumes for the play. She's
          funny.GUIDOShe seemed so happy. I didn't want to
          interfere... Is she with anybody?LILLIGuido, she's my friend. I'm not her
          mother. I don't know. I expect so.
          Nobody likes to be alone. Promise me
          you're going to let me cut your hair
          and get rid of that awful beard.
                                      p. 89GUIDOI like to get about without everybody
           pointing at me.LILLIAnd where are you getting about?GUIDONowhere. Here. I walk. Just to be
           able to walk.LILLIAre you seeing anybody?GUIDONo, no. Nobody.LILLI(teasing)
           Well, it sounds exciting. Walking
           around and not seeing anyone, growing
           a beard.   I might come up here and
           join you.GUIDODon't tease me, Lilli.    My heart is -LILLI- I know.GUIDOI just miss her. I should have IDIOT
           tattooed on my forehead.LILLILuisa certainly thinks so.GUIDO(grasping at this)
           Does she? Did she really say that?LILLIStop! I'm not going to act as a
           postman between you both. Come back
           to Rome. Make a movie. Go to work.

He sits.   Lilli joins him.GUIDONo. Never. I've spent this time
           trying to learn something, Lilli, to
           not be the person who forgets about
           everybody else, the person who never
           grew up.

          Making movies wasn't your problem. You
          were your problem.   Don't stop being
          a child. You'll never make another
          movie! Nobody wants that...
          especially Luisa.

She indicates the people who pass.LILLI (CONT'D)Guido - there probably isn't a single
          person passing by who hasn't been
          touched in some way by one of your
          movies. That's your gift. That's what
          you've been given. Use it. Just use it
          with some grace. For Chrissake.GUIDO(doubtful)
          The only movie I could make now would
          be... I don't know... would be about a
          man trying to win back his wife.LILLISounds perfect.

The music of "Be Italian/Folies Bergere" plays and

People run past with props, lights, etc.    Showgirls are
hurrying. A beautiful confusion.

stops the engine, and sits for a moment in silence.
Summoning his courage, he gets out of the car. He is
greeted by Pierpaolo. He seems to need and acknowledge
his support. Pierpaolo is tender.GUIDOI can't remember how you do this.PIERPAOLOYou'll remember.INT. FANTASY DRESSING ROOMSThe camera moves through the backstage mayhem.

Mamma is in her dressing room preparing. Saraghina is
sharing a dressing room with a Priest. He is helping
with her corset. Carla and Luigi. Carla fixes her
husband's hair. Claudia and Stephanie smoke and talk.
Lilli adjusts her own, and other men's wardrobe.INT. STAGE 5, FILM SET, CINECITTA - DAYGuido is in his element again, locked in passionate
discussion with an ACTOR and an ACTRESS. In his hand,
an actual script. The set surrounding them is modest;
a tiny bedroom with a single window and rumpled sheets.
The vast film Italia has clearly given way to something
smaller, and perhaps truer: the tale of a man and a
woman.GUIDOI don't want to say too much. The
          first way that we kill our film is by
          talking about it. But this scene is
          about reconciliation. And within the
          scene I would like you to try and find
          your way to begin that journey back
          towards each other.INT. FANTASY DRESSING ROOMSYoung Guido rushes by the dressing rooms.YOUNG GUIDOPresto! Presto! Take your places!

watches Older Guido at work.GUIDO(Continuing to speak to
                  his actors)
          Maybe it's the most important building
          block that we have to begin again...
          We start from the beginning each time
          and I feel today as if I'm starting
          from the beginning. We'll just keep
          asking each other questions, and don't
          look to me for the answers, okay?

On cue, Young Guido opens the door behind him and
ushers in THE CAST OF GUIDO'S LIFE. They enter with a
sense of anticipation and excitement and arrange
themselves on the staircases and scaffolding that loom
behind Guido. They are all dressed in angelic white.

But Guido is oblivious, focused instead on the task
that lies ahead. He talks to his cameraman. Puts down
his script. He takes off his jacket and hangs his
glasses off his sweater, stands contemplating the set
in front of him.PIERPAOLOMaestro, should I call final checks?GUIDOYes.PIERPAOLOMakeup, please! Final checks!

A LONG WIDE PAN reveals a tableau vivant looming behind
Guido like a glorious choir, his every muse, his every
inspiration. They watch him as he begins to work. A
part of him now and forever.

Guido sits on the crane.

The soundstage door opens, and we see a small figure
slip quietly onto the set. Tentatively, she steps
through the shadows. It's Luisa. From a discreet
distance, she watches her husband return to his gift.

Pierpaolo calls for silence.PIERPAOLO (CONT'D)Alora. Silencio per favore. Silence

At the last moment, Young Guido runs fast, down the
maze of steps, across the soundstage and jumps onto the
crane with Guido as it begins to rise. Luisa watches.
As the last note plays, the crane soars higher,
carrying Guido up and up.GUIDOACTION.CUT TO BLACK.
