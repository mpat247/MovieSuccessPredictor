Jim CarreyEXT. STREET - DAYA UPS Man with a big pot belly is walking down the street, whistling and carelessly tossing a 
package in the air. We hear the sound of broken glass in the box. He passes a professional woman.UPS MANGood morning, UPS!He tosses the box behind his back like a basketball, then acknowledges another passerby.UPS MANUPS, good to see you!He takes a couple of steps, then flings the package incredibly high into the air, spins completely 
around and expertly drops to one knee and catches the box. A Hispanic man passes.UPS MANBuenos dias. Uo Pay eSsay.EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAYThe UPS Man dodges a couple of black kids as though playing basketball. He runs up the front 
steps of the building. He reaches out to open the front door and inadvertently flings the package 
behind him and back down the steps.He goes back, retrieves the package, then enters the building.INT. LOBBY - DAYSeveral people stand in the elevator. The UPS Man just makes it, but the door closes on the 
package... REPEATEDLY. He feigns embarrassment.INT. 3RD FLOOR - DAYELEVATOR DOORS OPEN. The UPS Man throws the package out onto the floor and starts 
kicking it down the hall like a soccer player. With one last big kick the parcel lands in front of 
APARTMENT 3B. He picks it up and knocks on the door.We hear a small dog barking.GRUFF MAN (O.S.)Shut the hell up, you stupid mutt!An angry, burly man pokes his nose hairs out the chained door.GRUFF MANWhat do you want?UPS MANUPS, sir. And how are you this
afternoon? Alrighty then!The man grumpily unchains the door. He's a big guy - 6'5", 250, and 50 of that is chest hair. A 
small Shiatsu stands beside him.UPS MANI have a package for you.The UPS guy thrusts the package toward the man. We can clearly hear broken glass inside. The 
man takes the package.GRUFF MANIt sounds broken.UPS MANMost likely sir! I bet it was
something nice though! Now... I

just sign here, here, and here,
and initial here, and print your name
here, we'll get the rest of the
forms out to you as soon as we

that he likes the UPS guy.UPS MANThat's a lovely dog you have. Do
you mind if I pet him, sir?GRUFF MAN(mumbles)I don't give a rat's ass.The UPS Man bends down and talks to the dog in a really sucky pet talk.UPS MANOo ja boo ba da boo boo do booo!GRUFF MAN(under breath)Brother.Before the Gruff Man can finish, the UPS Man stands back up and takes the form again.UPS MANThat's fine sir.

The Gruff Man looks over.GRUFF MANHey, stupid! Get away from the
door!The dog doesn't budge and this really pisses him off. He gets up and heads for the dog.GRUFF MANWhat's the matter with you, I saidGIT!!!He roughly picks the dog up by the scruff of the neck, but as he turns it around we see that it is a 
stuffed dog. Around it's neck is a business card that reads, "You have been had by Ace Ventura - 
Pet Detective." He breathes fire.GRUFF MANSon of a bitch!He smashes the dog to the ground.EXT. ALLEY - CONT'DAs the UPS Man/Ace rounds the corner, his shirt opens up at his pot belly and the Shiatsu's head 
sticks out. Ace is gloating.ACE(announcer's voice)That was a close one, ladies and
gentlemen. Unfortunately, in
every contest, there must be...A LOOSER!He jumps into an old beat-up Chevy Bel Air, and lets the dog out onto the passenger seat.ACE (CONT'D)LOOOHOOOSERRRHERRR!He then pulls open the car's ashtray, and to the dog's delight, it's filled with puppy chow.He tries to start the engine but it won't turn over. The dog shoots him a look.ACE(to dog)No problem, it gets flooded.
We'll just wait a few seconds.Ace sits back. SMASH!!!From Ace's POV we see a Baseball bat shatter the front windshield.ACEOr, we could try it now.Ace frantically tries to start the car. His new friend continues around the car beating the living shit 
out of it.ACEOooh, boy.ACE'S POVWe see the creep wailing on the car in Ace's side view mirror.ACEWarning! Assholes are closer than
they appear!The dog is barking insanely.ACE(to dog)You think you can do better?!The baseball bat is now pummeling the trunk.ACEWanna give me a push while you're

MIAMI CITY STREETS - DAYAce and his new pal speed away freely.Close on the happy dog, hanging his head out the car window. PAN across the broken windshield 
to Ace, also hanging his head out the window to see where he's going.The car drives by a sign on a telephone pole: "Reward" -- with a picture of the Shiatsu in Ace's 
seat.THRASH MUSIC ENDSINT. HOUSE - DAYA very sexy woman is hugging and kissing the Shiatsu.WOMANMy little baby. You missed mommy
didn't you? Did daddy hurt you?
I won't let him, no I won't. He
may have kept the big screen TV,
but he's not gonna keep my baby.
No he isn't.(very sexy to Ace)Thank you, Mr. Ventura. How can I
ever repay you?She slinks over to Ace and puts her arms around his neck.ACEWell, the reward would be good,
and there was some damage to my �She cuts Ace off with a devastating kiss.WOMANWould you like me to take you
pants off instead?ACEUmmmm� Sure.She pulls him toward the bedroom.WOMANIt takes a big man to stand up to
my husband. He's already put two
of my lovers in the hospital.ACEHow did he find out? Does he have
you followed.WOMANNo� I tell himShe plants a kiss on Ace's neck and pulls him down out of frame onto the bed.EXT. DOLPHIN STADIUM PLAYING FIELD - DAYThe stands are empty, but there's plenty happening on the field. The Miami Dolphins are 
practicing. Dan Marino is in top form, hitting pass after pass.Behind one of the goal posts, the team's mascot, a rare dolphin (SNOWFLAKE), wearing #4, is 
practicing his routine. The Trainer is dressed like a quarterback.TRAINER
Blue! 42! Blue! 42! Hut! Hut!Snowflake swims over, snatches a small football out of the Trainer's hand, and does an end zone 
dance on his tail. He then returns the ball to the trainer.The Trainer now sets the ball on the dolphin's tail and snowflake "kicks" a perfect field goal. The 
Trainer blows a whistle and raises both arms.DISSOLVE TO:EXT. DOLPHIN STADIUM PLAYING FIELD - NIGHTThe stadium is now completely empty. Snowflake peacefully swims around his tank.Suddenly, the water is illuminated by the headlights of an n.d. panel truck.The rear door slides open. Two men jump out in wet suits.They slip into the water while a third waits outside the tank.Snowflake surfaces to check out the action. One of the men holds out a fish. Snowflake eagerly 
takes it, then shudders as a large syringe is stuck into his back. Snowflake thrashes around.Quick cut of a hand with the blur of a ring slamming against the tank. But the needle has done its 
job. Snowflake quickly goes limp.Snowflake is loaded into the back of the truck. Move in on Snowflake's face. His excited cackle 
has turned into a painful whimper.The truck skids away passing the guard gate. The guard is hog tied and gagged, struggling to free 
himself.INT. ADELLE'S FRIENDLY PET SHOP - NEXT DAYClose up on a dead goldfish laying on a newspaper. We pull back to reveal ADELLE 
ROSENBERG, the seventy year old owner of a cluttered pet shop. She's handing a live goldfish in 
a bag to JENNIFER,  a very sweet nine year old.ADELLEHere you go, honey. Now
remember� this kind of fish
doesn't like it in the freezer.JENNYBut what's gonna happen to Dolly?ADELLEDon't worry, I'll make sure she
gets a proper burial.Jennifer exits. Adelle calls to her cat, and tosses it the goldfish. The cat catches it in mid-air.ADELLERest in peace.Ace enters the pet shop. It looks like he slept in his clothes.ADELLEWell� here comes another dead
fish.ACEHi, beautiful. What time do you
get off?ADELLEUh oh.ACE(suggestively)I've heard some pretty great
things about your kibble.ADELLEWell, I hope I'm not getting a
reputation.ACE(switching to mock anger)Just get me the food!She chuckles at Ace as she loads a couple of bags with different kinds of pet food.ADELLESo� ahh, when can I expect you
to pay your tab?ACEI'm a little bit Sli  Pickins,
right now, I'm a little Tight
Squeeze Louise, a little Welfare
Wolly, Potless Pissing Pete, I'm
ah �ADELLEIf you were a horse I'd shoot ya'.
Just take it.ACEGravy! I'm good for it, Adelle.
I'm on a very big case right now.Ace reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a flyer with a picture of a white pigeon.ACESee this pigeon? It's a true
albino. Some rich guy lost it.
He's offering a ten thousand
dollar reward.ADELLEWow, albino pigeons are very
rare. How are you going to find
him?ACEJust keep my eyes open, and hope
to god it doesn't snow.Ace grabs his bags and heads for the door.ADELLEYou're a good boy, Ace. A good
boy.He holds the door open for an elderly gentleman who is entering at the same time. The gentleman 
is walking a toy poodle on a leash. The poodle is dragging its butt along the entire length of the 
floor. Ace and Adelle just stare.ELDERLY MAN(in a loud voice)Do you have anything for ringworm?EXT. SURFSIDE APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAYAce enters the courtyard of a two story U-shaped apartment complex carrying his groceries. It's a 
crappy joint but he calls it home. Inside an open apartment on the ground floor, the landlord, MR. 
SHICKADANCE, sits watching TV, stuffing his face with cheese doodles. Ace sneaks past the 
door and up the stairs.EXT. SECOND FLOOR - DAYAce is just putting the key in the door when the landlord steps up behind him. Ace is startled by 
the dreaded 'Shickadance Rasp' (not unlike Linda Blair in THE EXORCIST).LANDLORDVenturaaaaa?Ace straightens up, but doesn't turn around.ACEYes, Satan?Now Ace turns around in mock surprise.ACEOh, I'm sorry, sir. You sounded
like someone else.LANDLORDNever mind the wise cracks
Venturaaa. You owe me rent!ACEMr. Shickadance� I told you,
you're my first priority! As soon
as I find the white pigeon,
you're paid!!LANDLORDI heard animals in there Ventura!
I heard 'em again this morning,
scratchin' around.ACEI never bring my work home with
me, sir.The landlord notices the bags of kibble.LANDLORDOh, yeah? What's all this pet
food for?ACE(beat)Fiber.The landlord isn't buying it.ACEYou wanna take a look for
yourself? Go head.Ace rattles his keys in the door. Then he swings it open and turns on the light. The house is clear. 
Ace walks in as the landlord stands there snooping and sniffing the air.ACEWell� are you satisfied?LANDLORD(still suspicious)Yeah, but don't ever let me catch
you with an animal in there,
that's all!ACEOkay then. Take care now. 'Bye
'bye.The landlord walks away as Ace closes the door.ACE(quietly to himself)LLOOSER.He then turns to the room and gives a distinct whistle.CHAOS ENSUES! Animals jump out from every direction. Lizards crawl out of drawers, birds fly 
through the air, all of them gravitating to Ace.ACE(to his flock)Ooshhooboobooboodoodoo!INT. MIAMI DOLPHIN HEADQUARTERS - LATER THAT DAYThe very imposing office of BOBBY RIDDLE, owner of the Miami Dolphins. Riddle, 70, is a 
take charge, doesn't take crap from anyone type of guy. He is yelling at ROGER PODACTER, 
an ex-linebacker in his early sixties, and MELISSA ROBINSON, Podacter's attractive assistant.RIDDLEI just want to know one thing; How
the hell do you lose a 500 pound
fish?!Melissa's about to speak but hesitates.RIDDLE (CONT.)What?MELISSAIt's not a fish, sir. It's a
mammal.An angry Riddle stands up.RIDDLEOh, thank you very much, Mrs.
Jacque Cousteau!PODACTERBob, she didn't mean anything by
it.RIDDLE calms down a little, and sits.RIDDLE(calmer)Listen, personally, I don't give a
good god damn about a fish.He looks at Melissa. She doesn't dare say anything.RIDDLE (CONT.)All I care about is winning this
Super Bowl! I want the players'
head in the right place. Shit,
Roger, you've been in this game
long enough, you know how
superstitious players are. Our
quarterback's been putting his
socks on backwards since high
school. And I got a lineman who
hasn't washed his jock in two
years because he thinks flies are
lucky! I want that god damn fish
on the field Super Bowl Sunday!FIND THE FISH, OR FIND NEW JOBS!INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTIONAn upset Podacter and Melissa walk through the hallway.PODACTERWhy did it have to happen now? I
got three stinking years left till
retirement.MELISSAI've got forty.PODACTERI'll tell you who did it. It was
those goddamn animal rights nuts!
Always out there with their
goddamn signs, ANIMALS WERE BORNFREE, STOP TORTURING SNOWFLAKE!That goddamn fish lives better than
they do!They stop outside Melissa's office by her secretary's desk.MELISSAThe police are checking into the
animal rights people.(to secretary)Martha, have the police called
back about the dolphin yet?MARTHANo, but I wanted to tell you, when
I lost my Cuddles, I hired a pet
detective.PODACTERA what?MARTHAA pet detective.MELISSAThanks Martha, but we'd better
leave this to professionals.MARTHAWell actually, he was quite good.
Pet detection is a very involved,
highly scientific process.CUT TO:EXT. ROOF OF HOUSE - SAME TIMECLOSE ON ACE - COOING like a pigeon. Widen to reveal, Ace precariously perched on the 
roof of a two story building. He is four feet away from "The" pigeon. Ater a beat, he makes a 
mad, spastic, yet scientific, lunge for the bird.ACEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!The bird makes a clean getaway. Unable to stop his momentum, Ace flies past the edge of the 
building and slides down the side of the roof.EXT. GROUND - CONTINUOUS ACTIONBAM!!! Ace crashes to the ground. As he lies face down, in a heap of trash, his beeper goes off.EXT. DOLPHIN HEADQUARTERS/BOBBY RIDDLE STADIUM - DAYParking lot. Ace's clunker drives by some real nice cars. Employees stare at him.INT. SECURITY CHECK POINT - DAYA stern guard is admitting people into the stadium. He scans each one with a security detection 
wand.MAN #1Art Wheeler. Sporting supplies.The guard scans him. He goes.MAN #2Tom Anderson. Concessions.The guard scans him. He goes.ACEAce Ventura. Pet detective.The guard stares at Ace, accusingly.INT. MELISSA'S OFFICE - DAYMartha enters.MARTHAAh� Mr. Ventura to see you.MELISSAOkay, send him in.Martha exits, Ace enters.MELISSA (CONT'D)Hi, I'm Melissa Robinson. Did you
have any trouble getting in?ACENo, the guy with the rubber glove
was surprisingly gentle.MELISSA(apologetically)Super Bowl week. Security's
tight. Mr. Ventura, I'll get
right to the point�She slips a tape in the VCR and gestures for Ace to sit.MELISSAOur mascot was stolen from his
tank last night. Are you familiar
with Snowflake?The tape shows Snowflake doing a trick. The trainer, dressed like a quarterback, shouts out 
signals.TRAINER (ON TAPE)
Blue! 42! Blue! 42! Hut! Hut!Snowflake swims over, snatches the small football out of the trainer's hand, swims the length of 
the pool, does an end zone dance on his tail, then returns the ball to the trainer.MELISSA (O.S.)We got Snowflake from the Miami
Seaquarium. He's a rare Bottle
Nose Dolphin. That's the new
trick he was going to do during
the half-time show.While Ace studies the tape, he chews sunflower seeds in a bird-like fashion, placing the shells in a 
neat little pile on her desk.MELISSAWould you like an ashtray?ACENo, I don't smoke.He adds more shells to the pile.Melissa is already wondering if she has made a mistake.MELISSATo be honest, Mr. Ventura.
I'm pretty skeptical. Before
today, I didn't even know there
was such a thing as a pet
detective.ACEWell, now that you do, you'll know
who to call if your Schnauser ever
runs away.MELISSAHow did you know I have a
Schnauser?Ace pulls a, invisible-to-the-naked-eye dog hair off here blouse and presents it to her.ACEHe's young, about five pounds,
black coat, white speckles�(sniffs the hair)�likes to chase cars.MELISSAVery impressive.ACEYou should see what I can do with
a good stool sample.MELISSAI can hardly wait. Look, we've
got a problem. Can you help me or
not?ACE(coy)Well, sea faring creatures aren't
really my expertise�MELISSAWe'll give you three thousand
dollars on delivery.Ace immediately becomes the narrator of a nature show.ACEThe dolphin is a social creature.
Capable of complex communication.
Traveling in large groups or
schools�EXT. PLAYING FIELD - A SHORT TIME LATERThe Dolphin players practice. A crowd of reporters interview Marino.MARINOWe just choked in 82. We had a
chance to win it and we didn't.
Nobody's gonna choke this time,
and if they do, I'll kill 'em.Ace and Melissa head for Snowflake's tank.MELISSAThe police were here this morning.
Apparently, the kidnappers used
the back gate.Ace bends down to look at some tire tracks on the field.MELISSA (CONT'D)They said some kind of a �ACEFour wheel drive van� loaded from
the rear.Ace sniffs the turf. Podacter enters nervously.MELISSAOh, hi, Roger. How are you holding
up?PODACTERWell if it looks like I'm walking
funny it's because I have a bunch
on reporters up my ass. They've
been asking me about Snowflake all
day. Who's this?MELISSARoger Podacter, meet Ace Ventura.
Ace is our pet detective.Podacter shakes his hand.PODACTERNice to meet you. Martha Metz
recommended you very highly.ACEMartha Metz? Martha Metz. Oh
yeah, the bitch.PODACTERWhat?ACEPekinese. Hyperactive. Lost in
Highland Park area. She was half
dead when I found her. Is that

minutes� call Lloyd Bridges.INT. DOLPHIN TANK - MOMENTS LATERWhile eating sunflower seeds, Ace meticulously examines the tank, including the scratches where 
the hand banged up against the wall when Snowflake was stolen. All the while, he is singing a 
bastardized version of the theme from, "Flipper."ACE�Wonderful Flipper� glorious
Flipper� magnificent
Flipper� The flippiest Flipper�Podacter and Melissa, watching from the rim, look at each other like, "What have we gotten 
ourselves into?" Podacter spots something.PODACTEROh, great.A hoard or reporters are headed their way.PODACTER (CONT)I'll try to head them off.MELISSA(to Ace)Get out of the tank.ACE(still singing)�Can't hear you Flipper,
Flipper� Lookin' for Flipper,
gotta find Flipper�MELISSAI said, get out of the tank! Now!The reporters draw closer. Podacter heads them off.REPORTERSo where's Snowflake?PODACTERAh� Snowflake is just, ah, not
available right now.REPORTERCome on, I'm supposed to get a
shot of his new trick for the
evening news.REPORTER #2What? Is he sick?Other reporters chime in.VARIOUS REPORTERS
Did something happen to
Snowflake?! What're you
hiding..?!Melissa and Podacter don't know what to say. Then, a strange voice is heard.ACE/HEINZ (O.S.)(unrecognizable accent)How cun I be getting dis vork dun
mit all da shouting? What for is
dis shouting?REPORTERWho the hell is that?MELISSAThat? That's�ACE/HEINZHeinz Kissvelvet. I am Trainer of
Dolphins. You vant to talk to ze

Just yesterday I'm asking
Snowflake� "ee, eee, eee." He
said, "Eee, eee, eee, eee." Und
you can quote him.Ace spits at the reporters' feet. Podacter jumps in.PODACTERGentlemen, please, Coach Shula's
press conference is just about to
begin. Why don't I take you over
there and let, ah, Heinz, do his
job.He ushers the press away.MELISSA(sotto to Ace)Are you finished, Heinz?ACENot yet.Ace goes to the filter outside the tank, opens it, and pours out its contents � mainly leaves, small 
twigs and gunk. He roots through it, notices a very tiny amber stone. He smiles to himself.ACENow I'm finished.EXT. METRO POLICE DEPARTMENT - LATER THAT DAYA flurry of activity in the detective division. As Ace enters, several cops taunt him on sight, led by 
the obnoxious, SERGEANT AGUADO.AGUADOHey, Ventura! Make any good
collars lately?ANOTHER COP
Or were they leashes?They all bust up. Aguado spots a bug on the ground.AGUADOUh oh.(steps on the bug)Homicide, Ventura!The cops are falling all over themselves laughing.AGUADOHow you gonna solve this one?!Ace walks up to them and looks at the squashed bug.ACEGood question, Aguado� first I'd
establish a motive. In this case
the killer saw the size of the
bug's dick, and became insanely
jealous.The other cops all react with a big "ooooooo". Aguado has no comeback. Ace comes face to face 
with him.ACEThen I'd lose thirty pounds
porking his wife.Aguado suddenly loses it and swings at Ace.With a lightening move, Ace sidesteps the punch and forces Aguado's face down next to the dead 
bug.ACENow kiss and make up.Ace walks off.ACE(to himself)LLLOOOSER!Ace walks to the desk of EMILIO ECHAVEZ, a young energetic member of the homicide 
division. Ace has a silly impish look on his face.ACE(playfully)I miss you.EMILIOIt's not a good time, Ace. If
Einhorn sees me talking to you I'm
gonna be history.ACEOkay. Just tell me what you got
on Snowflake. That's all I need.EMILIO�I can't say anything. My hands
are tied.ACE(effeminate)Sounds like my kind of a party.A cop comes to Emilio's desk.COPLook alive, Einhorn's on her way
down.EMILIOAce, please?!ACEJust tell me who's working the
case?EMILIOAguado.ACEAguado?! He's pimple juice! He's
the poster child for lead paint
chip eaters!EMILIOLook, Ace. We're a little busy
with murderers and drug dealers.
A missing dolphin isn't exactly a
high priority.The elevator is getting closer.EMILIOAce, gimme a break will ya?Ace nonchalantly sits back in a chair, pops a sunflower seed into his mouth and cracks it loudly.EMILIO(quickly)Okay, okay. We checked all the
local animal rights groups,
taxidermists, and we're running a
check through DMV on all recent
van rentals. So far, nada.ACEAny unusual bets being made?EMILIOAce, it's the Super Bowl, of
course there's bets being made.ACEWhat'd you find out about the
tank?EMILIONothing weird. Just the tire
tracks and the exit route. The
guard didn't see anything.ACEThat's it?EMILIOThat's it. I swear. Now please
go away!ACEYou know something?(again impish)YOU'RE NICE!Ace gets up and exits the room. Then just as Emilio sighs with relief, Ace pops back in.ACEWhat about crazy Philly fans?The elevator bell rings. Out steps police LT. LOIS EINHORN, mid 30s, with a slender build, a 
great pair of legs and a bad tude.ACEHoly Testicle Tuesday!EINHORN(to Emilio)What the hell is he doing here?ACEI came to confess. I was the
second gunman on the grassy knoll.EINHORNSpare me the routine, Ventura. I
know you're working the Snowflake
case. May I suggest you yield to
the experts on this one? We'll
find the porpoise.ACE(mock relief)Whewww� now I feel better!Ace turns to go.ACE (CONT)Of course, that might not do any
good. You see, nobody's missing a
porpoise. It's a dolphin that's
been taken. The common Harbor
Porpoise has an abrupt snout,
pointed teeth, and a triangular
thorasic fin, while the Bottlenose
Dolphin, or Tursiops Truncatus,
has an elongated beak, round,
cone-shaped teeth, and a
distinctive serrated dorsal
appendage. (beat) But I'm sure
you already knew that. (beat)
That's what turns me on about you.
Hey� maybe I'll give you a call
sometime, lieutenant. Your number
still 911? Alrighty then!Ace exits.CUT TO:INT. TEA ROOM - NIGHTA wild thrasher club. An incredible thrash band is on stage cranking. Kids jump wildly into the 
moshing pit.Ace enters, sees a burnout at the bar whose head is circling insanely to the music.ACE(shouting)Excuse me?! Is Greg here?!The burnout's head thrashes on. No acknowledgement of Ace.ACEThank you!Ace heads for the basement stairs.INT. BASEMENT STAIRS - NIGHTAce descends the stairs, stopping at a large steel door. Ace bangs on it three times. A voice is 
heard from inside.VOICE (O.S.)Password!ACETom Vu! I pay for sex! You can
too!CLICK! The door electronically unlatches and slides open.INT. BASEMENT - NIGHTAce enters. Green Peace "Save the Whales" posters abound. GREG/WOODSTOCK, a laid 
back, ex-hippy with long gray hair, sits at a very impressive computer set up. Ace and he have 
their own distinct banter.A thud from above. Ace looks up.ACE'S POVPart of the ceiling is made of metal grating, so you can see the bottom of the dance floor. A guy's 
face gets smashed into the grate. We see that it is the burnout from the club.ACE(to burnout)Found him!WOODSTOCKHey! St. Francis! How's it goin?ACESuper, and thank you for asking.
Hope you're having a nice day.WOODSTOCKDo you?ACEDon't I? And what are you up to?WOODSTOCKJust watching the fishies, man.There is a BLIP on the computer screen.WOODSTOCKAlright, you're just in time for
the party. You see those blips?ACEI certainly do.ON THE SCREENA map with several ships on the ocean.He quickly taps in some commands and the ships start sailing in all different directions.WOODSTOCKThat's a Norwegian whaling fleet.
I'm sending them new directional
coordinates� They'll find Jimmy
Hoffa before they find any
Humpbacks.ACEGravy.Woodstock moves to a different screen.WOODSTOCKCheck this out.More computer graphics come up on the screen.WOODSTOCKJust changed the formula for
Purina's puppy chow.(turns to Ace)Too much filler, don't ya' think?ACE(acting turned on)I'm very attracted to you right
now.Woodstock chuckles.WOODSTOCKAre you?ACEAren't I? Can you still tap into
all the aquatic supply store in
the area?WOODSTOCKOf course I can. Why?ACEI want to trace the sale of any
equipment for transporting or
housing a dolphin within the past
few months�WOODSTOCKC'mon, Ace. I thought you might
have a challenge for me�Woodstock starts hacking away.ACEOkay then, try to remember the
sixties.WOODSTOCKWow! God one! Let's see�
Marine winch sling, feeder fish,
20,000 gallon tank�He waits. We hear a beep.WOODSTOCKThat's it. I found the culprit.ACEWho is it?WOODSTOCK(dramatically)�Sea World.ACE�bastard.WOODSTOCKHang on, hang on�(He taps a couple keys)Well, what do we have here?
That's a lot of equipment for a
civilian.The printer spits out some data. Woodstock rips off the page and hands it to Ace.ACERonald Camp? The billionaire?WOODSTOCKBillionaire and rare fish
collector.ACERRREHEHEALLY!A PICTURE OF CAMPComes up on the computer screen.WOODSTOCKThat, my friend, is the face of
the enemy.He pages through his file on screen.WOODSTOCK�Always tryin' to get his hands
on endangered species�Newspaper articles fill the screen. One shows a picture of Camp and some Dolphin players.ACEHold on, this guy's connected with
the Dolphins?Ace leans in.WOODSTOCKCamp donated the land the new
stadium's built on.(re: article)Oh, look at this, he's throwin'
another, "I'm the richest man in

myself a date.INT. CAMP'S MANSION - NIGHTIt's a magnificent home. There is an extremely formal party in progress. Twenty to thirty people 
having champagne, caviar, and hot air. We see Dan Marino sitting with an audience around him.DANWe just choked in 82. We had a
chance to win and we didn't. But
nobody's gonna choke this time; if
they do, I'll kill 'em!Everybody laughs.EXT. CAMP'S MANSION - NIGHTAce and Melissa climb an impressive stairway leading to Camp's mansion.MELISSAI'm really going out on a limb
here, Ventura. Camp's social
events are strictly A-list.ACE(a la Love Connection)'Well, Chuck� the date started
off good, but just before we got
to the party, she seemed to tense
up.'Melissa rolls her eyes, then taps a huge door knocker.MELISSAI swear, if you do anything to
embarrass me in front of Camp�ACEYou mean like this?Ace starts doing a spastic body convulsion. Just then a bald-headed butler, who looks a little like 
Gavin McCloud, opens the door. Ace doesn't notice until Melissa hits him with her purse.ACEOwwwe!!!He sees the butler.ACEOh, hi Captain Stubing.Melissa storms in, already pissed.INT. CAMP'S MANSION - CONTAce and Melissa enter. Camp looks over.CAMPMelissa! Glad you could make it!
Oh, and who is this?MELISSAThis is my date. He's a�
lawyer.CAMPWell, does he have a name, or
should I call him "Lawyer"?MELISSAI'm sorry, it's Ace - ah, Tom Ace.Ace is very unimpressed with her lying ability. He jumps in.ACETom Ace. Wonderful to meet you,
Mr. Camp, and congratualtions on
all your success. You smell
terrific.CAMPAh, well, thank you. Please, come
in.Ace boldly leads the way over to an hors 'oeuvre table. Melissa closely follows.MELISSA(sotto)This is insane. There's no way
that Camp stole Snowflake.ACE(spreading pate' on a cracker)Will you just keep him occupied,
while I work my magic please.She crosses the room. He puts the cracker in his mouth and begins to crunch. A man in a tux 
beside Ace spreads pate' on his own cracker.ACE(with a mouthful, to man)Smooshy, isn't it?Off the stuffy man's reaction�INT. CAMP'S MANSION - SECONDS LATERAce approaches Camp.ACEExcuse me, Ron, I need to use the
bathroom?(palms his stomach, whispering loudly)I think it's the pate'.CAMPUm, it's just over there.ACEThanks. Stuff probably looks
better on the way out, huh?Ace laughs, slaps Camp hard on the back and heads for the bathroom.INT. BATHROOM - CONTAce wastes no time. He locks the door, turns on the water faucet, steps onto the toilet seat, opens 
and climbs out a window.EXT. MANSION COURT YARD - CONTAce drops to the ground. He follows a pathway, through a gazebo and into a doorway, all the time 
quietly singing the musical score to 'Mission Impossible'.INT. CAMP'S MANSION - FISH TANKS - CONTAce browses through a myriad of dramatically lit, salt water tanks, still singing. They're all filled 
with colorful exotic fish. Very impressive, but nothing large enough to house a dolphin. He 
continues on towards a large door.INT. TANK ROOM - SECONDS LATERA huge above-ground tank is covered with curtains to discourage onlookers. Ace swings open the 
large door and enters.ACEGravy.Ace climbs a ladder on the side of the tank, singing more intensely now. The ladder leads to a 
narrow catwalk over the center of the water. Ace grabs a feeder fish from a pail and walks 
carefully out there.CLOSE ON ACE. THIS IS IT.He looks into the dark pool, but sees nothing. Now he stops singing, quietly squats down and 
dangles the fish over the water.ACE(gently)Snowflake� Here, Snowflake�
Snooowflaaaake�A GREAT WHITE LUNGES OUT OF THE WATER AND SNAPS ITS JAWS AN INCHFROM ACE'S FACE!!! NEEDLESS TO SAY, ACE IS A TAD SURPRISED.He reels back, falling off the catwalk, into the water.INT. CAMP'S MANSION - SAME TIMEMelissa is admiring some beautiful tropical fish. Camp approaches.CAMPWonderful, aren't they?MELISSA(nervously)Yes. They're incredible.CAMPNo matter what is going on in my
life, I can always watch them
swim and be completely at peace.INT. INDOOR POOL ROOM - SAME TIMEThe water is still for a moment. Then, Ace breaks the surface.ACE(frantic, to himself)It's not Snowflake� It's not
Snowflake.Instantly, Ace's body is thrashed around back and forth through the water, the entire length of the 
pool.ACE(screaming)IT'S NOT SNOWFLAAAAKE!!! IT'S NOTSNOWFLAAAA!!!INT. CAMP'S MANSION - LATERA line is forming outside the bathroom. Camp and Melissa are seated nearby. He's getting curious.CAMPAre you sure he's okay? It's been
an awfu;;y long time.MELISSAWho, Tom? Oh, I'm sure he's fine.Ace suddenly opens the bathroom door and stands there, completely drenched from head to toe, 
with his pants in shreds. Everyone stops. They all stare at Ace in amazement.ACE(loudly to the entire room)DO NOT GO IN THERE!(fanning the air)Whewww!!EXT. CAMP'S MANSION - LATERAce and Melissa are exiting. Camp stops in the doorway.CAMP(still confused)I'm very sorry, Mr. Ace. I'll
have the pluming checked
immediately.ACEBe sure that you do. If I had
been drinking out of that toilet,
I might have been killed!Ace shakes Camp's hand and notices his ring. He holds on to get a better look. It's a very distinct, 
commemorative ring.Camp wants his hand back but Ace won't let go. Melissa finally drags Ace away.MELISSAWe'd better go.Camp looks on and shakes his head.INT. MELISSA'S CAR - NIGHTAce is thinking. Melissa is pissed.MELISSA�Y'know, I don't even want to
know why your pants are missing!
I don't care what happened! You
could have cost me my job.ACE(on his own wavelength)I was wrong about Camp. He's
breaking the law but he's not our
guy.MELISSAIt's a sure thing! It's
definitely him! Just get me in
there! Let me work my magic!Ace takes the stone out of his pocket and studies it intensely.ACEThis is the key. Right here!MELISSAHiring you was the biggest mistake
I ever made!ACESo small! So unnoticeable! Yet
an invaluable piece� of our
twisted little jigsaw puzzle!Melissa stares at Ace like he's gone crazy. There is a flash of headlights and a car horn. Melissa 
swerves back into her own lane. Ace drops the stone somewhere on the seat and begins to search 
for it frantically.ACEDamn it!(to Melissa)Try to keep it on the road.INT. MELISSA'S LIVING ROOMMelissa enters, followed by Ace.MELISSASo, you found a pebble in
Snowflake's tank. Excuse me while
I call CNN.ACEI found it in the filter. And
it's not a pebble. It is a rare,
triangular cut, orange amber.Ace hands Melissa the stone and quickly goes to one of her bookcases.MELISSAWhat are you talking about?ACETonight I saw the exact same stone
in Camp's ring.Ace finds a book on the Dolphin team and flips through it.MELISSAI thought you said he didn't do
it.ACEN. Camp's clean. His ring
wasn't missing a stone. But
whoever was in that tank had a
ring just like his.MELISSAWait a second. What ring?Ace hands her the book. It's open to a photo of�ACEThe 1982 Dolphin AFC Championship
ring.Melissa holds the stone up to the picture. It's a perfect match.ACEI find the ring with the missing
stone, I find Snowflake.MELISSAHow are you gonna do that?ACESimple.MUSIC UPCUT TO:EXT. TRACK - DAYAce is wheezing and gasping for air as he struggles to jog up beside a large man who's running 
around the track at a very fast pace. When he finally catches up, he awkwardly tries to catch a 
glimpse of the man's ring and trips. The man just keeps going.INT. FOOTLOCKER - DAYAce sits waiting with one shoe off. The store manager, an ex-player for the '82 team, sets down 
several shoe boxes. Ace checks out the ring.CLOSE ONA poster of the '82 team. The player we just saw is being crossed out.EXT. HOTEL - DAYPan a few kids getting autographs from Marino and other players, ending on Ace dressed up and 
looking like a pimply kid. As the players sign, he checks their rings.EXT. TRACK - DAYAce is again trying to catch the large man on the track. This time, just as he draws near, the man 
leaves him in the dust.INT. SPORTS BAR - DAYTwo big guys finish arm wrestling. Ace steps up to challenge. He spends an undue amount of time 
preparing his grip, as he checks out the ring. Ace finally gets set and gives the "go ahead" nod. He 
is instantly thrown across the room.CLOSE ONThe poster of the '82 team. Another group of players are being crossed out.EXT. STREETAce spots a player driving along side him. He can't see his ring.Ace deliberately cuts off the player's car and flips him off. The angry player flips Ace off. We see 
his ring is intact. Ace waves and drives off.INT. MEN'S ROOMOne huge lineman uses a urinal. Ace, using the urinal next to him, nonchalantly tries to catch a 
glimpse of the guy's hands. The Lineman has a very angry look on his face, but after a beat it 
changes to a "come on" smile.CLOSE ONThe poster of the '82 team. There is only one face that has not been crossed out. Ace circles it.EXT. TRACK - DAYOnce again we see the large, fast man jogging toward camera. Suddenly Ace runs up behind him, 
with a desperate look on his face, pouring a bottle of chloroform into a cloth. He leaps onto the 
man's back, smothering him with the cloth and holding on for dear life. The man slowly gives up 
the fight and collapses. Ace casually checks the ring, then walks away disappointed.EXT. MELISSA'S BACKYARD - EARLY EVENINGAce sits in a lawn chair depressed. Melissa consoles him.MELISSAAce, that stone could have come
from anywhere. An earring, a
necklace�ACE(with murder in his eyes)It came from an '82 AFC
Championship ring.MELISSALt. Einhorn thinks it was an
animal rights group. Have you
heard of FAN?ACEFree Animals Now? Started in 1982
by Chelsea Gamble, daughter of the
famous industrialist, Fischer
Gamble? Over half a million
members from Florida to Finland?(beat)No. Who are they?MELISSADid you know that last year they
sent threatening letters to 127
college teams, demanding the
release of their mascots? At last
count �ACEWhat do you feed your dog?We see Melissa's dog lying near Ace's feet.MELISSAAh� dog food, why?ACEHe's miserable.MELISSAWhat are you talking about?ACEHe's just very unhappy, I feel
sorry for him. Bad diet, isolated
environment. It's amazing he's
still alive.MELISSAYou're just mad because your
stupid pebble theory didn't work
out and you don't know how to
express your anger.ACEYeah? And you're ugly.MELISSAI'm not even gonna' talk to you,
please leave.ACEWhat, so you can beat him? Fatty!MELISSAYou� are unbelievable.The phone rings inside the house. Melissa goes to answer it.MELISSAHiring you was a huge mistake!The door slams and Ace is alone with the dog. After a moment he reaches down to pet it and we 
all see that it is one of the happiest dogs in the world.ACEYou like her, huh?� Yeah, she's
alright.Ace, feeling guilty, walks into the house.INT. MELISSA'S DEN - CONTAce walks toward Melissa.ACELook, Melissa, I, ah�Ace stops when he sees Melissa. She is sitting, holding the phone in her lap with a completely 
stunned look on her face. Something is very wrong.EXT. HIGH RISE APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHTChaos. Police, lights flashing, paramedics, crowds of people.Ace and Melissa see Roger Podacter's body taken away in an ambulance.ACEYou okay?Melissa nods bravely. Emilio joins them.ACEWhat'd you find?EMILIOPodacter, Roger. Routine suicide.
He was alone. He'd been drinking.
No sign of a struggle. Neighbor
heard him scream on the way down.
Just your classic fifteen story
swan dive.Melissa shudders. Ace gives Emilio a "way to go" look.EMILIOSorry.INT. HIGHRISE LOBBY - NIGHTThe three enter. Emilio pushes the button for the elevator.MELISSAIt just seems so out of character.
He was going to retire in two
years.ACEDid he leave a note?The elevator arrives.EMILIONo. That's nothing unusual. Some
do, some don't. He didn't.The elevator doors close.INT. PODACTOR'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATERPolice are everywhere. Emilio, Ace and Melissa enter and are immediately approached by one of 
the officers.EMILIOMiss Robinson, this is officer
Carlson.CARLSON
Evening, ma'am. I wonder if you
could answer a few questions about
the deceased?Ace slips away, we follow him as he eavesdrops on conversations.NEIGHBOR(to a cop)I told you, I was across the hall
in my apartment, I heard a scream.
The door was locked, so I called
the manager�The Manager reiterates her story to the cop. The Manager is about 100 years old.MANAGER�The place was empty, except for
the damn dog in the other room.
Then I opened the balcony door,
looked over the railing,
and� splat, bang, pancake time�Ace, continuing his investigation notices�PODACTER'S DESKin perfect order.Next, he notices police coming in and out of the balcony, closing the door behind them, shutting 
out the noise.INT. PODACTER'S BEDROOM - NIGHTA dog is cowering in the corner. Ace tries to comfort the little guy.ACEHey, fella, have a bad night?Ace examines its paws.Ace then gets down and finds scratches in the door. TWO FEET interrupt.Ace stands. He is face to face with Einhorn.EINHORNWho let Dr. Doolittle in?Emilio steps in immediately.EMILIOAh, Lieutenant. He came with Miss
Robinson �EINHORNThis is official police business.
We'll let you know if the coroner
finds any ticks.Cops snicker.EMILIOI just thought since Melissa �ACEE, forget it. She's right.
Besides, I wouldn't want someone
tracing my steps and pointing out
all the mistakes I made.Ace crosses to�EXT. PODACTER'S BALCONY - CONTAce examines the area. Einhorn is in hot pursuit.EINHORNOh, so, you don't think this in an
obvious suicide, Mr. Pet
Detective?ACEWell, I wouldn't say that. Lord
knows, there is plenty of evidence
here to support your theory,
except of course that spot of
blood on the balcony.On the railing, sure enough, there is a tiny spot of blood.Einhorn glares at a couple of nearby cops. They look down.ACEMay I tell you what I think
happened? Alrighty then!Ace moves as he talks.ACERoger Podacter went out after
work. He had a few drinks, and he
came home. But he wasn't alone. 
Someone was with him in this
apartment. There was a struggle,
and then Roger Podacter was thrown
over that balcony. Roger Podacter
didn't commit suicide. He was
murdered.A beat as everyone considers this.EINHORNWell, that's a very entertaining
story, but real detectives have to
worry about that little thing
lawyers call evidence.Ace picks up a lottery ticket on Podacter's desk and becomes a condescending kid show host.ACELet's take a trip to clue
corner, shall we? Can anyone tell
me why a man buys a lottery ticket
on the day he is going to commit
suicide? Or why the family pet,
suffering from acute canine
trauma, clawed at the bedroom door
until his paws bled? How about
the blood on the railing? I'll
bet if we put our thinking caps on
we'll see that it was the result
of the struggle that took place
inside this apartment while Mr.
Podacter was still alive!(singing)NEXT TIME YOU DON'T HAVE A CLUECOME ON BACK TO CLUE CORNER! BOOP!Everyone looks to Einhorn.EINHORNNot a bad try for a pet detective,
but not near conclusive enough for
us real investigators.(beat)First, people buy lottery tickets
everyday. It's a habit. It
doesn't prove a thing. Second,
the dog wasn't suffering from
canine trauma, he was suffering
from bladder trauma. Sergeant
Neilson found a piss stain as big
as Lake Huron near the bed. And
third, the blood on the railing.
Simple. He doesn't jump far
enough and whacks his head. A
fact confirmed by the paramedics
who found cuts on his scalp, with
traces of a white chalky
substance. i.e. plaster from the
balcony.Einhorn shows Ace the paramedics report. Everyone is impressed with Einhorn.EINHORNSo much for your murder, Ventura.AGUADOUh oh, I think I heard a toilet
flush. Maybe someone lost their
turtle?Everyone has a laugh. Ace looks beaten.ACEWell, maybe I'm just a little out
of my league, here. Einhorn�Ace holds out his hand, Einhorn shakes it.ACE�good work.Ace and Melissa head for the door.ACEOh, there is just one more thing,
Lieutenant.(re: the neighbor)This man is Roger Podacter's
neighbor. He lives across the
hall. He said he heard a scream,
is that right, sir?The neighbor nods. Ace turns to the apartment manager.ACEAnd you said you had to open the
balcony door when you keyed into
the room?MANAGERThat's right.Ace walks out onto the balcony and turns, facing them.ACEYou're certain you had to open
this door?She nods.EINHORNWhat's the point, Ventura?ACEOnly this�AAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWW�Ace sustains an incredible Pavorati note, while he repeatedly opens and closes the glass door 
between them. When the door is closed nothing can be heard.ACE(tapping the door)This is double paned, sound-
proofed glass. There's no way
this neighbor could have heard
Podacter scream on the way down
with this door shut. The scream
he heard came from inside this
apartment, before Podacter was
thrown over the railing! And the
muderer closed the door before he
left!(celebrates insanely)Yes! Yesss! I have exorcised the
demons!(a la Poltergeist)This house is clear.INT. ACE'S CAR - A SHORT TIME LATERAce drives straight ahead.MELISSAWhat are you thinking?ACEI'm thinking this whole thing is
connected somehow.(frustrated)I'm thinking I want to find that
other ring!MELISSAYou checked all the rings.ACEI know, Pessimistress. Could
anyone else have gotten a ring
that year?MELISSANo. Camp was the only honoree.
Just players and coaches.
Everyone in the photo.ACE�Receipts! There must be
receipts! You have a key to the
office.MELISSAAce this has been a really tough
day. Can't we do this in the
morning?Ace looks at his watch.ACEAbsolutely.EXT. DOLPHIN HEADQUARTERS - 1:00 AMAce's car screeches to a stop, in front of the building. Ace jumps out, followed by Melissa.INT. DOLPHIN HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - NIGHTIt's dark. Team pictures adorn the walls.MELISSA (O.S.)These files go back to seventy-
eight.INT. DOLPHIN OFFICE - CONTINUOUSAce is flipping through a file cabinet, looking at receipts. Melissa is starting to warm to him.MELISSAThat was pretty impressive, what
you did back at the apartment.ACE(still looking)You don't have to tell me. I was
there.MELISSAMaybe you should have joined the
police force� become a real
detective.ACE(shaking his head)I don't do humans.Melissa gets a bit closer.MELISSAYou really love animals, don't
you?Ace stops searching and looks into her eyes.ACEI feel a kinship with them. I
understand them. Wanna hear
something kinda spooky?MELISSASure.She gets closer still.ACEOne time, when I was about twelve,
I had this dream that I was being
followed by a dog with rabies. He
had these really bloodshot eyes
and foam coming out of his
mouth� and just before I got to
my front door� he jumped on me
and sunk his teeth in. Then I
woke up, and felt the back of my
neck� check this out.Ace motions for Melissa to feel the back of his neck, but when she does, he snaps at her hand, 
barking like a vicious dog.ACEARARAR!!!Melissa jumps out of her skin.MELISSAOhhh!! You bastard!ACE(snickering)I'm sorry. I couldn't stop
myself. Are these all the
receipts?MELISSA(mildly annoyed)I don't know.ACEThere's only a dozen of them here.Ace turns from the file cabinet with a hopeless look on his face. Melissa begins to clean up his 
mess.MELISSA(pointedly)Gee� maybe they were misplaced
because somebody didn't put the
files back when he was�ACEWho the hell is that?MELISSAWhat�Ace crosses to a big picture of the '82 team that hangs on the aadjacent wall and points out a 
player.ACEThat! Who the hell is that?!He quickly pulls out his crossed out pictures of the team and begins to compare the two.MELISSAOh, that's Ray Finkle� the
kicker. Don't you know who Ray
Finkle is?ACENo! How come he's not in this
picture?!Melissa checks Ace's photo.MELISSAThis was the picture you were
using? This was taken earlier in
the year. Finkle wasn't added to
the roster till mid-season.She starts to realize what Ace has already figured out.MELISSA (CONT'D)He's the guy that missed the final
field goal in the Super Bowl that
year. Cost the Dolphins the game.ACEBut he got a ring?MELISSADefinitely.INT. STADIUM/PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICE - LATERAce and Melissa look through Finkle's file on a microfiche screen. Newspaper articles, headshots

be left alone.MELISSAWhat do you suggest?CUT TO:INT. ACE'S BEDROOM - LATERWe see a person's butt under a sheet coming up into frame repeatedly.SKIN, SWEAT, SHEETS FLY,  as Ace and Melissa roll back and forth on the bed. Ace is taking 
no prisoners.CUT TO:50 animals at the bottom of the bed, with eyes as big as silver dollars, watching them silently. We 
cut back and forth between furious lovemaking and shots of staring animals.Melissa and Ace simultaneously reach the pinnacle of pleasure.MELISSA(totally amazed and exausted)OH man� oh man! Oh wow!ACE(mock embarrassment)I'm sorry� that's never happened
to me before. I must be tired.EXT. HIGHWAY ONE - DAYVarious traveling shots of Ace en route to a 'Deliverance' type town deep in the Everglades. A 
sign reads "Gas - Food - 2 Miles" but the word "Food" is crossed out.INT. BILBO'S GAS STATION - DAYA pitifully sad country song plays on the radio. FERN BILBO sits at his cluttered desk with the 
end of an old shotgun in his mouth. He is struggling to reach the trigger.Through the glass behind him, we see Ace's car pull up to the only gasoline pump.DING! The bell rings. Fern begrudgingly takes the gun out of his mouth, sets it down and walks 
out.EXT. BILBO'S GAS STATION - CONTAce gets out of his car.ACEExcuse me, sir. Do you know where

around the bar. A couple hapless guys play pool. One throws darts.Ace enters, pops a sunflower seed in his mouth and addresses the room.ACEExcuse me, guy?! My name is Ace
Ventura, I'm a pet detective. I'd
like to ask you a few questions if
 I could.No one even looks at him.ACEJust a few questions, that's all.Still no one reacts.ACE(very up)Who wants gum?!Again, no reaction. Ace walks over to the bartender and slides a five across the bar.ACEI'm looking for a guy who used to

bullet holes and paint bombs. Toilet paper is strewn through the trees. Ace walks up and knocks 
on the door. A wooden peephole slides open revealing a suspicious pair of eyes.ACE�Hi, I'm looking for Ray Finkle.A gun slides out into Ace's face.ACE(with a gulp)And a clean pair of shorts.A deep gruff voice from inside.VOICEWhat do you know about Ray Finkle?ACESouthpaw soccer style kicker.

furious.VINNIEGet some more fish!INT. BEHIND MACHINERY - CONTINUOUSRoc walks behind a big piece of machinery, reaches down for the pail of smelts, but sees nothing.ROC

Roc in the head with a pail full of fish.ACE(doing Brando)He sleeps with the fishes.INT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - CONTINUOUSVINNIEHey Roc, what the hell was that?Vinnie cocks his gun and goes to check out the sound.INT. BEHIND MACHINERY - CONTINUOUSVinnie rounds the corner and sees nothing. He walks a little further and notices a trail of smelts 
lined up on the ground.He follows the trail around a corner and we see Roc, unconscious but moaning. He is sitting 
against the ground, with his legs spread apart and the pail over his head. The trail of smelts leads 
to his crotch. There is one halfway into his zipper, with its tail flipping.Vinnie takes in this sight, then rushes over to Roc and stands him up.VINNIEHey man! What happened? What's
goin on�?We see Ace at the top of a giant machine. He is aiming a 200 pound steel hook, that hangs on a 
chain from the ceiling.ACEGuess what, boys, it's nap time.Ace gently releases the hook. Just as Vinnie and Roc turn to look, the iron hook shears both of 
their heads clean off.Two headless bodies fall to the ground in slow motion with blood gushing from their necks.CLOSE ON ACE - HORRIFIEDACEHooooly Shiiit! Oh my god! I
didn't mean to - Oh man!!!Ace holds his head and dances around, completely freaking out what he had done.ACE(looking to God)Lord, I swear! I just wanted to
knock them out!Ace abruptly stops to think.ACEIs that murder? I don't know.
They were gonna kill me. But they
didn't� But they tried. That's
self defense. That's it!! I have
nothing to worry about!!CUT TO:Ace nervously whistling as he wipes his fingerprints off the hook.INT. IRONWORKS FACTORY - FACTORYAce checks on Snowflake then goes to Marino. He signals for Dan to keep quiet, then starts to

lieutenant. I wouldn't want you
to get a tumor.EINHORN(into phone)Sergeant Aguado, it's Lt. Einhorn.

trapped in the warehouse. It's

first.(to Ace)I wouldn't want you to miss that.Einhorn walks to the edge of the tank. She aims the gun at Snowflake and FIRES!We see the bullet miss Snowflake under water.Snowflake swims wildly. She FIRES again! Misses again. Suddenly, Ace HOLLERS!ACEBlue forty-two!!Einhorn turns to Ace.EINHORNSHUT UP!!ACEBLUE FORTY-TWO!Einhorn shoots at Ace! He dives out of the way.ACEHUT! HUT!Suddenly, Snowflake leaps out of the water and takes the gun out of Einhorn's hand, like the trick 
we saw earlier. Snowflake swims around the pool with the gun in his mouth.ACE(smug)Yes. The highly trained dolphin.
Perhaps the smartest mammal in the
animal kingdom. See how he knew
exactly what I wanted him to do,
as if our minds were somehow in
complete synchronization. They
have been know to save men at sea
you know. They have their own
language.(to Snowflake)Snowflake. Come here, Snowflake!
Bring me the gun!(makes dolphin sounds)EEEEEE! EEEEEE! EEEEEE!Just like the trick in his routine, however, Snowflake swims around the tank, passes Ace, then 
hands the gun back to Einhorn. He finishes with a tail walk.ACE(under his breath)Stupid fish.ON TV: Miami's kicker boots a perfect field goal from fifty yards.JOHN MADDENHe got all of his leg into that
one!The field goal kicker is hugged by his teammates.ACEGood to see someone who doesn't
buckle under the pressure?MARINOYeah, not like in 82 when we

pressure?ACEWell, I've kissed a man.JOHN MADDEN (ON TV)Of course, there's never been a
more crucial kick than the famous
Kick heard 'round the world�The famous footage airs on TV. They all turn to watch.JOHN MADDEN�I mean, it's clear to me that
it was a good hold. Finkle just
booted it.EINHORNThe laces weren't out. THE LACESWEREN'T OUT!!Einhorn takes a shot at the screen, creating a hole in Madden's forehead. Ace uses the moment to 
smack the gun out of her hand.A HUGE, NO-HOLDS-BARRED FIGHT ensues. Ace and Einhorn punch each other about the 
face and stomach.Einhorn throws a punch at Ace. Ace goes down.Einhorn goes for the loose gun. Ace leaps and tackles her.They both crash into old rusty equipment, raising a mountain of dust. Marino struggles all the

continues. They try but can't get a bead on Ace as the two roll around on the floor.More punches. They fight up a flight of stairs, then back down. To the amazement of the SWAT 
team, Ace and Einhorn slug it out as equals.AGUADO(caught up)Get him, Lois!Now they crash through a plate glass window together. Ace gets to his knees first and wobbles 
toward the gun. It's the first clear shot the SWAT team has had.EINHORN(screaming)Shoot him! Shoot him!We all hear the guns cocked. We see Ace in the rifle sights. We see fingers twitch on triggers.A loud voice comes from off camera.EMILIODON'T SHOOT! HOLD YOUR FIRE!Melissa is holding Emilio's gun under his chin.MELISSAPut down your guns or this cop

trigger.(loud to cops)She's not joking!The SWAT team leader signals his men. They lower their guns. Einhorn gets back to her feet.EINHORNHe kidnapped Snowflake. He killed
Roger Podacter, and he was about
to kill Dan Marino and me!ACEHo, ho! Fiction can be fun! But
I find the reference section much
more enlightening.(doing his best Clarence Darrow)For instance, if you were to look
up 'professional football's all
time bonehead plays', you might
read about a Miami Dolphin kicker
named Ray Finkle, who missed a
twenty-six yard field goal in the
closing seconds of Super Bowl
Seventeen.(in one breath)What you wouldn't read about is
how Ray Finkle lost his mind, and
was committed to a mental
institute, only to escape and join
the police force under the assumed
identity of a missing hker,
seducing her way to the top, in a
diabolical plan to get even with
Dan Marino whom he blamed for the
entire thing!!!Ace gasps for air. Everyone is totally confused.AGUADOWhat the hell are you trying to
say?ACEShe's not Lois Einhorn! She's Ray
Finkle! She's a man!EINHORNHe's lying! Shoot him!Ace walks over to her.ACELet's just see who's lying. Would
a real woman have to wear one of
these?Ace dramatically pulls at Einhorn's hair, thinking it's a wig. Einhorn's head flies back. The hair is 
real. Ace keeps tugging it.The SWAT team ready themselves.ACE (CONT'D)Boy, that's really on there! But
tell me this: Would a real woman
be missing these?!Ace rips open Einhorn's blouse, and reveals two beautiful feminine breasts.The sharp shooters are tensing. Ace is laughing nervously now.ACEHa, ha, ha! That kind of surgery
can be done over the weekend! But
I doubt if she could find the time
during her busy schedule to get
rid of Mr. Knish!!Ace rips off Einhorn's skirt. Einhorn now stands there fully nude. She appears to be the perfect 
figure of a woman.ACEOooh boy.Ace looks at Melissa and Emilio and shrugs his shoulders. Then, just when it seems all is lost, Dan 
Marino who is back behind Einhorn, motions for Ace to come over.MARINOPsst� Ace. Come here.ACE(to everyone)Could you excuse me just a second.Ace goes to Dan. Melissa still holds Emilio hostage.EINHORNShoot him. Shoot him, now!!MELISSA(to cops)Don't anybody make a move!Marino whispers something in his ear. Ace looks confident again. He once more addresses the 
crowd.ACELadies and gentlemen, my esteemed
colleague Mr. Marino, has just
brought some new evidence to my
attention. Now, history has
certainly shown that even the most
intuitive criminal minds can be
wrong, from time to time. But, if
I have been mistaken� if the
lieutenant is indeed a woman�
then my friends, she is suffering
from the worst case of hemorrhoids
I have ever seen!!!Ace spins Einhorn around now, exposing to the world, the healthy set of male genetalia that Finkle 
has learned to keep tucked between his legs. (And if we have any balls, we'll actually show it.)Everyone gasps. CLOSE UP ON EINHORN/FINKLE. He finally drops the facade.FINKLE(deepest voice possible)It was Marino's fault. The laces
were in.(breaking down now)They were IN!!!Quick cuts of all the cops spitting with disgust. Then Emilio spits.Then CLOSE ON Marino spitting. They all have kissed her/him/it. Even Snowflake blows his 
spout.Ace confidently cracks a sunflower seed.ACESomebody read it its rights.Suddenly, Finkle picks up a shard of broken glass and lunges at Ace.FINKLEDIE ANIMAL BOYYYYY!!!Thinking fast Ace sidesteps Finkle and sends him head first into Snowflake's makeshift tank. After 
a few seconds Finkle fights his way to the surface and thrashes around, helplessly.FINKLE(gasping for air)Help I can't swim!!!Finkle goes under again. We see him under water sinking down.Snowflake swims to him now, allowing him to grab onto his fin and pulls Finkle gently to the side 
of the pool. Finkle lies there exhausted.Ace reaches down into frame, removing the '82 AFC Championship ring from Finkle's finger. We 
see that it's the ring with the missing stone. Ace replaces it with the stone in his pocket. It's a 
perfect fit.ACELLLOOOSER! LLOO HOO SERR HERRHERR!!!Melissa is still holding the gun on Emilio.EMILIOMelissa� you can give me back my
gun now.Melissa has forgotten she even had the gun. She hands it to Emilio and faints in his arms.Now Aguado appears beside Ace.AGUADOI don't know how you did it,

awesome spectacle.Some fireworks go off around the tank. A  marching band plays a triumphant tune. We see a
