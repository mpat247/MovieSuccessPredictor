				 December 22, 1983FADE IN:TITLE SEQUENCEEXT.  V.A. HOSPITAL - DAYA drab GREEN SEDAN with U.S. ARMY printed on the door
stops at the steps of a fortress-like colonial-style
building.
Iron bars cover the windows.
The lawn sprinklers snap mindlessly to themselves.
A CRT-style printout appears at the bottom of FRAME:D-MINUS 117 HRSFAYETTEVILLE, NORTH CAROLINAANGLE ON SEDANas the doors open and TWO POWERFUL MPs, one of whom was
driving, emerge.  The other opens the rear door for
COLONEL SAMUEL TRAUTMAN who stands, eyeing the imposing
facade of the hospital.
Trautman is in his early fifties and wears the mantle of
command sternly but without arrogance.

He takes the stairs with purposeful strides, the MPs
falling in behind him.

HOLD ON THE SIGN above the main door as they go inside:VETERANS ADMINISTRATION HOSPITALINT.  HOSPITALA gray metal door bearing the sign "NEUROPSYCHIATRIC WING"
bangs open and a massive ORDERLY in white passes through.
He is followed by the two MPs, Trautman, and a SHORT
DOCTOR who hustles to keep up with the others.

LOW ANGLE DOLLY PRECEDING the entourage as they stride
forward.
The MPs are grim-faced and walk in step.

Trautman and a doctor SINGLETERRY silently walk through
the corridor.

They pass the open day-room where somnambulistic patients
sit like statuary watching "The Young and the Restless" or
watching the wallpaper fade.
Bleak light from an overcast day filters through the
barred window.

The vets seem older than their years and although some
show the physical scars of combat, there is no doubt that
the greatest trauma for these men is behind the eyes.

As they pass the open doors of the rooms of the "chronic
ward", haunted eyes turn toward them.

As they approach the nurse's station for the "chronic
ward" the orderly nods.
The HEAD NURSE turns to her console.INSERT - AS NURSE'S HANDhits a button on the console.TIGHT ON SECURITY DOORas a solenoid-operated bolt snaps back with a loud BUZZCLACK.The orderly's good hand shoves the door open.INT.  "VIOLENT" WARDThe entourage enters a long narrow corridor lined with
locked doors.POV DOLLYING ALONG CORRIDOROccasionally faces appear at the safety-glass windows set
in the doors.  Men whose souls have fled.
Their eyes track us as we move past.

An emaciated MAN in an untied hospital smock and bare feet
stands as if lost in the center of the corridor.REVERSE ON GROUPDOLLYING as they detour around the man, whose clawlike
hand catches at Trautman's tunic.
A hoarse, demented SHOUTING issues from one of the doors,
a desperate WAILING from another.INT.  STAIRWELLCLOSE ON DOOR LATCH as keys RATTLE and the door opens.

WIDER as the group enters a dark service stairwell.  The
single fluorescent light flickers stroboscopically, a
pulsing twilight.LEWISShit.  Maintenance never gets down
		here.

They descend two flights to a door of steel bars on a
sliding track.

The MPs flank Lewis as he unlocks the door.SINGLETERRYSo what am I supposed to do?  Can't
		transfer him to Leavenworth.  He's
		civilian.  So I put him in an
		isolation cell that hasn't been used
		since the Spanish Inquisition.TIGHT ON BARRED DOORrolling aside on metal tracks.  CLANG.INT.  CORRIDORThis area of the hospital's basement has been used for
little but storage in recent years.
Stacks of obsolete equipment gathers dust, leaving only a
narrow walkspace.

The steel doors of the isolation cells yawn open, except
for the last one.TRAUTMANMaybe you should have tried cutting
		him some slack.

Lewis opens a cabinet near the single locked cell and
removes a SMALL RIFLE.  He feeds a SYRINGE-LIKE SHELL into
the single-shot bolt action.TRAUTMAN(continuing)
		What's that?SINGLETERRYTranquilizer syrette gun.  Borrowed
		it from the Animal Control
		Department.

Trautman pushes the barrel aside with a contemptuous snort
and steps up to the cell door.TRAUTMANGimme a break.
			(nods toward door)
		Open it.

The two MPs flank the door.  One pulls on the latching
lever.  Bolts slide.  The door swings open, revealing
blackness.LEWIS(muttering)
		Thinks he's the fucking Prince of
		Darkness.

One MP tries the switch beside the cell, flicking it
several times.  Nothing.

He glances apprehensively at the other MP and they step
into the dark cell.INT.  CELLTIGHT ON A HAND, dimly outlined, as it twists a light bulb
a half-turn in its socket.

In the sudden light the MPs face an imposing figure.

JOHN RAMBO, wearing only a pair of filthy jeans, stands
"ready" before them.  The single light bulb on the low
ceiling sends glistening highlights over his taught body.
A nasty piece of machinery.

Long, matted hair coils onto his shoulders, and an unkempt
beard heightens the cheekbones beneath eyes which are
deep, reptilian.  Intense.

His position, though not overtly threatening, suggests a
willingness to strike without warning which gives the
M.P.'s pause.

Trautman steps forward between the MPs.TRAUTMANAt ease, Rambo.MED. ON RAMBOrising from his slight crouch to stand composed,
balanced... parade rest.TRAUTMAN(continuing to MPs)
		Wait outside.

He closes the door until it latches.TRAUTMANHello, John.RAMBOColonel.TRAUTMANMind if I sit down?

Rambo motions to the narrow bunk, dropping into an
Oriental squat himself as the Colonel sits.

Trautman's manner with Rambo is familiar, somehow
paternal.  A bit of an ironic grin twitches briefly.TRAUTMAN(continuing)
		I hear you're not enjoying it here.RAMBOI could take it or leave it.

Trautman sighs and leans back.TRAUTMANSeems like I'm always pulling you
		out of some goddamn toilet or other,
		doesn't it?RAMBOAm I out of here?TRAUTMANThat depends on you.
			(pause)
		Christ, look at you.  I give you
		this easy duty until I can get you
		an assignment... all you have to do
		is eat ice cream and watch soap
		operas... and you have to make it
		Rambo's last stand.RAMBOThere were treating me like a
		headcase.TRAUTMANHard to believe.  You shoot up one
		little town in Oregon with a fifty
		caliber machine gun... one little
		dogpatch town... and everybody
		figures your wrapper's broken.  No
		sense of humor.
			(pause)
		What did you expect?  An engraved
		plague from the chamber of commerce?

Rambo looks at his hands.  When he finally speaks his
voice seems distant, disembodied.RAMBOIn 'Nam I flew gunships.  Million
		dollar equipment.  Back here nobody
		trusts me to park cars.  I keep
		thinking it's going to be okay...
		but I've been out six years and it's
		not okay.  Sometimes I feel like I'm
		coming right out of my skin.

The colonel nods slowly.  He notices a battered shoebox on
the floor beside the bed.  The cell is absolutely devoid
of personal articles otherwise.TRAUTMANThis your stuff?RAMBOThat's it.  My life.TIGHT ON SHOEBOXas Trautman flips through a number of worn snapshots of
the men in Rambo's special forces unit.

They are horsing around, in and out of uniform.  A
younger, cleanshaven Rambo is among them.  He is grinning
broadly in one shot.
It seems uncharacteristic of the hardened man we see now.TRAUTMANHardcore outfit.  The best I ever
		trained.RAMBO(coldly)
		Those men are all dead.TRAUTMAN(glancing up)
		You're not.

He fishes something from among the pathetic debris of
Rambo's life.TRAUTMAN(continuing)
		Congressional Medal of Honor.RAMBO(bitterly)
		Yeah.  Big time.TRAUTMANPlus, what else?  Two Silver Stars,
		four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's
		Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of
		Gallantry and... uh, a handful of
		Purple Hearts.RAMBOFive.  I never wanted that stuff.TRAUTMANWhat did you want?RAMBO(haltingly)
		I just wanted... I don't know...
		after all that... I just wanted one
		person, one person, to come up to me
		and say "you did good, John." And
		mean it.  That's all.
			(pause)
		After all that.TRAUTMANYou just picked that wrong war to be
		a hero in.

The colonel studies Rambo a moment, then stands abruptly.TRAUTMAN(continuing)
		Let's take a walk.CUT TO:EXT.  V.A. HOSPITAL - DAYRambo and Trautman cross the manicured grounds, escorted
by the two grim MPs.

A number of wheelchair-bound vets enjoy the sunshine B.G.
and a desultory game of volleyball is in progress.

Still, the impression is of the detritus of war left
scattered on a huge lawn like broken toys.

As the two approach a conservatively dressed MAN waiting
on a bench under a plane-tree, stands.TRAUTMANJason Kirkhill... John Rambo.

Kirkhill extends his hand in greeting, but Rambo coolly
half-turns to reveal his hands, locked in WRIST-CUFFS
separated by a steel bar so that they can hang comfortably
at his sides.
Kirkhill grins affably.  Drops his hand.KIRKHILLGood to meet you, Rambo.  How are
		you?

Rambo scans Kirkhill's face, noting the cold scrutiny all
but concealed in the smile lines.RAMBO(coldly)
		You a spook?

Kirkhill drops the smile.KIRKHILLThat's right.  CIA Special
		Operations Division.

Rambo turns to Trautman.RAMBOI don't work with spooks.  Not after
		that op in Cambodia.KIRKHILLI'm authorized to get you out of
		here.  I thought that's what you
		wanted.RAMBO(considering)
		What's the job?KIRKHILLClassic special forces op... hit
		fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two
		days.RAMBOWhy me?KIRKHILL(shrugs non-
			 committally)
		We like you.
			(pause)
		At least the computer at Langley
		likes you.  Pulled your file because
		of various factors.  Service record.
		Area familiarity.RAMBOWhere?KIRKHILLNot yet.RAMBOI'm not jumping blind.

Kirkhill's eyes get hard.KIRKHILLIt's yes or no.  In or out... now.
		If it's "out," we will not have had
		this conversation.  If you come in,
		you will not be working for us.  No
		knowledge.  No comment.  Do you
		understand?

Rambo seems about to turn away.TRAUTMAN(to Kirkhill)
		Tell him.  I'll take responsibility.

Kirkhill looks pained, like he has gas.KIRKHILLNorth Vietnam.  What they call the
		Democratic Republic of Vietnam now.TIGHT ON RAMBOas he takes that in.  His eyes seem to see all the way
there already.  Emotions go through him.  Exhilaration
mixing with terror of the demon he can't turn away from.
He nods slowly.TRAUTMANWe left some people behind there,
		John... POWs.RAMBOThis just occurred to somebody, now?KIRKHILLWe don't leave our men, Rambo.

Rambo and Trautman lock eyes.
Something flows there... Trautman knows his soul.RAMBOYou got it.  I'm in.

He whips one hand around from his side, tossing the
manacle bar at a surprised Kirkhill's feet.
The wrist-cuffs are still closed.CUT TO:INT.  RAMBO'S CELLRambo stands alone in his cell, the door open behind him.
He hefts the shoebox filled with his worldly possessions,
the scraps of memory, dead friends, and symbols of valor
and violent death.

He upends the box, spilling everything into the open
toilet.

Flushes it.  And walks out.CUT TO:EXT.  FORT BRAGG - DUSKD-MINUS 84 HRSFORT BRAGG, NORTH CAROLINATIGHT ON BOOTED FEETclomping in rhythmic lockstep as a platoon of recruits

chain-link fence.AIRBORNE SPECIAL FORCES GROUPOPERATIONS CENTERINT.  CORRIDORKirkhill, accompanied by his basilisk-eyed AIDE, strides
past Rambo's two MPs flanking the door, into a small
room.INT.  BRIEFING ROOMThe room is an austere cubicle with the army's typically
drab furniture in "early functional."
The cold eye of a surveillance camera stares down at a
single table with a seated figure... Rambo, looking like
he may have been there for centuries.

The aide hands Rambo a sealed folder and extends a
clipboard and pen for him to sign off.KIRKHILLThis is your mission packet...AIDE(quietly overlapping)
		Sign here, please.  And here.KIRKHILLMemorize it here.  It doesn't leave
		this room.

Rambo unseals the folder, removing a sheaf of photocopied
documents, as Kirkhill perches on the table next to him.KIRKHILL(continuing)
		The twenty-four hundred American
		servicemen missing in action in
		Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia are
		officially listed "Presumed
		Killed." Certainly most of them
		are.

Rambo is leafing through the contents of his PACKET.  He
skips a stack of reports and fishes out several grainy 8 X
10 prints.KIRKHILL(continuing)
		But reports keep filtering in.
		Sightings by refugees.  Nothing
		verified.  Finally, we feel we've
		got enough to proceed on.

Rambo studies the prints.  They seem to be high altitude
surveillance photos of a small COMPOUND OF BUILDINGS,
surrounded by forests.KIRKHILL(continuing)
		Memo E-7 on top will cover the
		details.  An abandoned Vietnamese
		Army base in the North-central
		highlands may have a compound used
		as an internment camp.  As you can
		see the intelligence is soft.  These
		LANDSAT photos show huts...
		barracks.  It could be anything.RAMBO(flat)
		What's the plan?KIRKHILLThis operation is in two phases.
		Recon and rescue.  You are phase
		one.  Your two-man team will probe
		the site, confirm the presence of
		American POWs, if any, make
		photographic and tactical
		observations, then proceed to the
		extraction point without engaging
		the enemy.RAMBOWe don't try to pull out any of our
		guys if we find them?KIRKHILLNegative.  Absolutely not.  The
		phase two assault team will get them
		out.RAMBO(not pleased)
		We just take pictures?KIRKHILLDon't look so disappointed.  It
		should be hairy enough... even for
		you.CUT TO:INT.  DON MUANG AIRPORT - LATE AFTERNOONKirkhill's VOICE continues over the image of: The crowded
airport terminal, as Rambo, carrying a cheap flight bag,
weaves among jostling Orientals.KIRKHILL (V.O.)Your flight to Bangkok is at 06:30.

After a flurry of passport stamping Rambo clears customs
and makes his way to the main exit.EXT.  TAXI STAND - STREET - LATE AFTERNOONRambo emerges into the stifling humid heat of Bangkok in
May and stands, scanning for a cab.D-MINUS 51 HRSBANGKOK, THAILANDBangkok is a city of fervid motion and the street is
chaotic with traffic.
Stepping through throngs of Asians and tourists Rambo
reaches for the door of a beat-to-hell Citroen taxi
hunkered low at the curb like some metal lungfish.

He spins as a hand lightly touches his shoulder.MANSorry old buddy, I saw it first.

An American in his late twenties, the man speaks with one
of those hard-to-dislike Southern accents.  Probably North
Carolina.
He is lanky but muscular, with boyish good looks and hair
cut so short it barely qualifies as stubble.  Though
dressed in a loud Hawaiian shirt and Madras slacks, it is
painfully obvious the man is military.

His arm is draped around a gorgeous but overly made-up
Thai girl.MAN(affable)
		I kinda got an important date.

Rambo's eyes narrow as he turns wordlessly and climbs into
the taxi.

The American grins cockily and tosses his bag to Rambo.MANNo problem.  We'll share it.  Get
		your tail in there, sweet thing.INT./ EXT.  TAXIThe American and the girl pile into the broad front seat,
to the chagrin of the lizard-faced Thai driver.MAN(to driver)
		Indra Hotel.  And don't take the
		scenic route, Smiley... I know my
		way around this burg.  Comprende?

Rambo speaks quietly to the driver in Thai.RAMBO(Thai/subtitled)
		Same place for me.

The girl giggles as the American slips his hand up from
her stockinged knee, between her thighs.MANAh, you fair flower of the Orient.

She giggles, like a chirping bird.MAN(continuing to Rambo)
		She thinks everything I say is
		funny.  Don't you, Angel-pie?  Man,
		Thai women are the best.  Got the
		kinda legs I like... feet at one end
		and pussy at the other.

He turns to Rambo, who hasn't commented or taken any
observable notice of him.MAN(continuing)
		You don't say a helluva lot, do you,
		pal?  You speak English?RAMBO(coldly)
		Sometimes.

The girl coos to the American in pidgin English.THAI GIRLYou got money?  I stay you whole
		week.MANSweet thing, there's nothin' I'd
		like more than to wugga-wugga with
		you for a week, but tonight's all we
		got.

He lowers his voice conspiratorially, leaning close to
her.MAN(continuing)
		See, I'm on this secret mission, and
		tomorrow mornin' I head out to...

Rambo grabs the man brutally by his collar.RAMBOThat's enough, Brewer.

The American freezes at the sound of his name.  Turns
slowly.BREWER(realizing)
		You're Rambo?
			(pause)
		Ke-rist!

Rambo speaks sharply to the girl in Thai.RAMBO(Thai/subtitled)
		Get out.  Now!

The driver, confused, skids to a stop and the girl gets
out into the din of a cluttered shop district.  A flash of
slit skirt and then only fading curses behind them as the
taxi moves on.BREWER(brightening)
		Jeez, I never would have guessed.
		You undercover, Lieutenant?  Great
		disguise.CUT TO:INT.  INDRA HOTEL ROOM - DUSKTrautman, sipping a gin tonic at the window, spins around
as the door flies open.  Brewer storms in, followed a few
paces back by Rambo, who closes the door.BREWER(to Trautman)
		He says he's team leader on this
		show.TRAUTMANThat's correct.BREWER(controlling his
			 fury)
		Begging the Colonel's pardon but I
		understood I was up to lead my next
		mission.TRAUTMANNot this one.  You're on

		image-intensified gear you used in
		El Salvador last year.RAMBOThis clown almost blew mission
		security on the street.  I'm not

		I say we tape him to a chair.CUT TO:EXT.  OPERATIONS BASE CAMP - DAYD-MINUS 36 HRSBAN BUNG KHLA, THAILANDA small airstrip transects a meadow bounded by rain-
forested slopes.  Wreathed in low clouds the mountains
march into the distance in increasingly subtler shades of
gray like a Japanese watercolor.

Near a cluster of small buildings the scene is one of
manic but efficient activity as the high tech base camp is
assembled.

An enormous SIKORSKY CH-54 "SKY CRANE" lowers a Winnebago-
sized conex container as another roars by.  An Army Corps
of Engineers work crew, stripped to the waist, scurries
through the rotor wash.  The blasting air raises curtains
of muddy spray and drowns out the yelled commands of the
supervisors.

A Vietnam era HUEY UH-1D HELICOPTER nimbly touches down
nearby.  Rambo, in the pilot's seat, slips off his HEADSET
and climbs down.  Brewer and Trautman, in fatigues, jump
out and join him as Kirkhill approaches.

DOLLYING WITH THEM as they emerge from the rotor noise and
Kirkhill motions them toward the MOBILE TACTICALOPERATIONS CENTER (MTOC).KIRKHILLI didn't know you were a stick man,
		Rambo.RAMBOI was crossed-trained in gunships.TRAUTMAN(to Kirkhill)
		How long have you been setting up?KIRKHILLAbout 22 hours on site.TRAUTMANNice work.

They pass a tent-like CAMOUFLAGE CANOPY under which an
ALL-BLACK SIKORSKY UH-60 "BLACKHAWK" HELICOPTER squats
ominously.  It has no markings or insignia.
There is another canopy behind it, the contents of which
are screened from view.

Nearby is a cluster of CONEX AIRLIFT CONTAINERS, two of
which are joined together to form a building like a
double-wide mobile home.

Another unit contains a roaring generator, a fourth is
topped by TRACKING GEAR.  Cables snake through the mud,
connecting the units.

Kirkhill notices THREE WORK PARTY "GRUNTS" kibitzing
nearby, taking pictures of each other with a pocket
Instamatic.  He snatches the camera from a surprised young
corporal.KIRKHILLThis is a covert operation,
		numbnuts.

He opens the camera and drops the film in the mud.  The
corporal reaches petulantly for the camera.  Kirkhill
drops it casually in the mud as well.KIRKHILL(to Trautman
			 entourage)
		Check out the command hut.

He opens the door to the large conex unit and follows the
others inside.INT.  MTOCThe "hut" turns out to be a humming electronic womb.
In the subdued light banks of VIDEO MONITORS glow, and the
status lights of UPRIGHT COMPUTER UNITS line one wall.
Workstations for TRACKING, COMMUNICATIONS, AND LONG-RANGE
COORDINATION create a claustrophobic jumble of modular
equipment racks.BREWERMission control!

They wipe their muddy feet and enter the air-conditioned
command center.

Rambo gazes around at the jumble of gear.  He runs his
hand over one console, causing a seated technician to
glare at him.RAMBOAll this is for us?KIRKHILLThat's right.BREWER(to Rambo)
		They call us the field-unit meat-
		puppets.CUT TO:INT./ EXT.  CAMOUFLAGE CANOPY - DAYRambo and Brewer walk in under an expanse of net
camouflage on poles.
Sunlight streams through the foliage cover, creating
bright mottles on a black object F.G.

CAMERA PULLS BACK and BOOMS UP as Rambo moves forward to
reveal the object as an ALL-BLACK JET.  It is a modified
Gulfstream "Peregrine," a small sleek single-engine
executive model, with all insignia and I.D. numbers
removed.MED. ON RAMBO AND BREWERas they consider the aircraft.BREWEREver do this from a jet?RAMBONo.VOICE (O.S.)It's easy...

They turn to see a lanky long-haired man in a leather
flying jacket duck under the fuselage from the far side
and approach them.MAN(grinning)
		Just have to jump fast.

Two other air crewmen jump down from the open rear
passenger door of the plane.RAMBOYou the pilot?MAN(extending hand)
		Yeah.  Doyle.

			 two in the door)
		Lifer and Fuhrman.

Doyle is a product of the sixties' school of ultra-cool,
his brain a little torched by too many methed-out night-
missions.
Fuhrman, the co-pilot, grins too much and Lifer's eyes are
just plain scary.RAMBOYou boys Air Force?DOYLEMarines.  'Ex' though.  We're

He turns to a vending machine nestled improbably between
two racks of electronics.TRAUTMANYou think they'll find any?KIRKHILL(feeding in change)
		POWs?  I don't know.  But either

He pounds the machine, which refuses to vend.
Trautman watches the Special Operations Officer banging
ineffectually on the COIN RETURN, amid a million dollars
worth of equipment.EXT.  FLIGHT TENTA tent next to the camouflage canopy serves as a flight
shack for Doyle and his ground crew.  Crates serve as
tables and stools, and 50-gallon fuel drums are the back
wall.
Doyle, with Rambo and Brewer, continues the game plan.DOYLEA couple klicks from insertion we go

		punch out.  Navigate in free fall
		like a regular HALO jump.  You'll

Doyle notices that Brewer has casually lit up a cigarette.DOYLEHey, man... we got fuel on the deck.
		I don't like flying without a plane.

Brewer glances at the pool of jet fuel around the pumping
area.
Rambo plucks the cigarette from Brewer's lips.RAMBONo smoking on this mission.  It's
		not healthy.

He looks Brewer in the eye and flicks the lit butt into
the pool of gas.
Which puts it out.BREWERSon of a bitch!
