                                       Final DraftFADE IN:INT. ZITO'S BREAD STORY - DAYSeveral dozen loaves of golden Italian bread are standing on 
               end in a shaft of morning sunlight. They are standing on end 
               in bins. In the window, ZITO'S can be read in reverse.

               We leave the loaves and DRIFT DOWN TO a Progresso Products 
               calendar, which hangs from the wall by a nail. The month is 
               November. Various phone numbers and delivery dates have been 
               penned in in a rough scrawl. Now WE GO TO a white formica 
               counter, scuffed and pocked from long use. On the counter, 
               in a rinsed out olive jar filled with water, are three fat 
               red roses. The TITLE APPEARS IN BLACK SCRIPT AGAINST THEWHITE BACKGROUND.MOONSTRUCKNow WE FAINTLY HEAR THE VOICE of Zito himself, and a lowTAPPING SOUND. SOME CREDITS ROLL.ZITO'S VOICE(barely discernable)
                         Three times they cancel the order 
                         with me, and three times they come 
                         back. Who they kidding? They cheap, 
                         cheap, cheap. The other bread they 
                         get is no good. They save pennies. 
                         Everybody complain and they come 
                         back. "Zito, your bread is the best." 
                         They're like children stupid in school 
                         who cannot learn. The water. It's 
                         the water. You buy bread in Hoboken, 
                         you get Hoboken water. Hoboken water 
                         is dry. Ask anybody who knows. Ask 
                         your father. He knows.

               During Zito's plaintive words, WE LEAVE the roses and MOVE 
               DOWN the counter TO a calculator being tapped very efficiently 
               with the eraser end of pencil. When the results appear, the 
               pencil notes the figure in a threadbare old ledger.NOW WE SEE ZITOHe's a middle-aged Italian man with a kind face. But it's 
               early in the day, and he's already been working for hours, 
               so he's a little tired and disgruntled.ZITOYou want me to make you some coffee?NOW WE SEE LORETTA FOR THE FIRST TIMEShe's entering a few final figures in the ledger. LORETTA is 
               Italian, 37. Her hair black, done in a dated style, is flecked 
               with grey. She's dressed in sensible but unfashionable clothes 
               of a dark color.LORETTAWhat d'you know about coffee? Gimme 
                         a loaf of bread.EXT. ZITO'S BREAD STORE - DAYLoretta emerges with her little weathered leather bookkeeping 
               satchel and a loaf of Zito bread in a white paper bag. She 
               moves off briskly.EXT. A.J. CONTI FUNERAL CHAPEL - DAYThis is a little Italian funeral parlor.INT. THE "WAKE" ROOM"A generic little room filled with many flowers and wreathes, 
               many folding chairs, a few OLD PEOPLE sitting and, up front, 
               the star of the show, the CORPSE on display in his gold and 
               formica casket. Before the casket is a little kneeler. We 
               discover an OLD LADY there, who crosses herself and rises.

               She goes and sits by RUBY, another old women. She leans over 
               and says.OLD WOMANHe looks great.RUBYThat Al Conti is a genius.INT. OFFICE OF THE FUNERAL PARLORFirst WE SEE a name plate on a desk. The plate reads ALFONSO 
               CONTI. We HEAR his VOICE.CONTI'S VOICEI am a genius.

               The SHOT WIDENS TO INCLUDE the loaf of bread which is half 
               cut up and being buttered. Next to the bread are two steaming 
               mugs of coffee. We HEAR the subdued TAPPING of Loretta's 
               tabulations.LORETTA'S VOICEIf you're such an artistic genius, 
                         why can't you keep track of your 
                         receipts? How am I going to do your 
                         income tax?CONTI'S VOICEI am an artistic genius.

               The SHOT WIDENS and now we can see Al Conti and Loretta 
               sitting at the desk having Zito's buttered bread and mugs of 
               coffee. Loretta's got her calculator going and is entering 
               figures in Al's black, gold-lettered ledger.LORETTAIf you're an artistic genius, how 
                         come you got butter on your tie?

               He looks down and sees the stain. He's at a loss.LORETTAGive it here. I'll give you this, 
                         Al, you make good coffee.

               She downs her coffee, accepts the stained tie which Al has 
               taken off, and slams the ledger shut.INT. ROBERT'S DRY CLEANERS - DAY - MORE CREDITS ROLLWe are looking at a wall of dry-cleaned clothes bags. They 
               are hanging from an automated grid. As we watch, the wall 
               starts to move off to the left. A gap appears where no clothes 
               are hung. The gap creates visual frame. In the frame is 
               ROBERT. He is operating the grid with a little stick shift. 
               He stops it and takes down a garment. He leaves the frame, 
               heading off to the counter. When he moves away, WE SEE that 
               Loretta is behind him, working her calculator, entering in a 
               ledger. She slams the ledger shut, waves goodbye, and goes. 
               After beat she reappears, produces Conti's tie, says something 
               to Robert, who is out of view, leaves the tie, andINT. BUTCHER SHOP - DAYWE SEE a cleaver whacking an oxtail into section.

               Now WE SEE Loretta, a few feet away, tabulating on a chopping 
               block that is partially obscured by a row of hanging rabbits, 
               unskinned.INT. A FLORIST SHOP - DAYA long white box is being filled with red roses. We HEAR theFLORIST'S VOICE.FLORIST'S VOICERed roses. Very romantic. The man 
                         who sends these knows what he's doing.

               Now WE SEE Loretta tabulating and the Florist working on the 
               box of roses.LORETTAThe man who sends those spends a lot 
                         of money on something that ends up 
                         in the garbage can.

               The Florist gives her a look and then smiles.FLORISTI'm glad everybody ain't like you, 
                         Loretta. I'd be outta business.LORETTAWithout me, you'd be out of business. 
                         I like flowers.

               She gives him a sudden, brief, blinding smile. It's the first 
               time we've seen her smile. She has gold work around one of 
               her two front teeth. The Florist grunts and hands her a red 
               rose. Camera moves close to Loretta and the rose.END OF CREDITSDISSOLVE TO:EXT. THE GRAND TICINO - AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHTA red neon sign hangs in the window.

               It's a quaint downstairs restaurant in Greenwich Village. A 
               YOUNG COUPLE stop, look at the menu, become more interested 
               in each other, kiss, and decide to go in.INT. THE GRAND TICINO - NIGHTWhite tablecloths and dark green walls, a tiny bar up by the 
               door. The WAITERS all look a little alike. That's because 
               they're all related. The place is about half full, and bustles 
               along pleasantly.MUSICA VIOLIN PLAYS a melancholy Neapolitan air.

               MR. JOHNNY and Loretta sit at a table for two talking quietly.

               They have their menus and glasses of red wine. Mr. Johnny is 
               Italian, around 42. His wavy salt-and pepper hair is 
               impeccably combed back; but there is so much that it threatens 
               to fall forward someday and engulf his face. He is wearing a 
               pinky ring, a dark suit, a gold watch, and, on his face, a 
               mustache and a look of incredible seriousness. Loretta is 
               Italian, 37. Her black hair, done in a dated style, is flecked 
               with grey. She is wearing a dark blouse, black skirt, and 
               high heels. One of her teeth is framed with gold work.

               Mr. Johnny is really timid of life, an overgrown boy, who 
               hides these qualities behind a veil of dignity.

               Loretta is tough and efficient, loyal and watchful; she 
               watches out for Mr. Johnny, and defends him against life.

               BOBO, an Old World Italian waiter, comes over to take their 
               order.BOBOAre you ready?MR. JOHNNYHello, Bobo. How are you tonight?BOBOVery good, Mr. Johnny.MR. JOHNNYWe will both have the Salad Ticino.BOBOUh-huhMR. JOHNNYAnd I'll have the special fish.LORETTAYou don't want the fish.MR. JOHNNYNo?LORETTAIt's the oily fish tonight. Not before

                         You look after me.

               They HEAR a distinguished MAN'S VOICE rise out of the babble.

               They turn and look. The man's name is PERRY.PERRY AND PATRICIA FROM LORETTA'S POVPerry is a university professor. PATRICIA is his 
               girlfriend/student. He's in his 50's. She's about 25 years 
               younger. She's getting her coat on in a huff.PERRYPatricia, please don't go!PATRICIAWhat do you think I am, a talking 
                         dog?PERRYI was just making a point about the

               She storms out, leaving Perry muttering to himself.PERRYKiss my aspirations. Oh, very clever. 
                         The height of cleverness. Waiter!

               An abnormally SHY WAITER stops.SHY WAITERYes?PERRYCould you do away with her dinner,

               out over the restaurant tables. Bobo is melancholy and

               Perry takes his arm.PERRYMay I presume to ask you a question?SHY WAITERSure!PERRYDo you have a girlfriend?SHY WAITERI am alone in the world.

               Perry lets go of his arm. He and the Shy Waiter commiserate 
               a moment. Then, wordlessly, the Shy Waiter goes.PERRYThat's very sad.

               BOBO IS CLEARING THE REMAINS OF MR. JOHNNY'S DINNER. He's 
               already cleared Loretta's.BOBOHow's things?LORETTAFine, Bobo. We'll take the check.MR. JOHNNYNo, I want to see the dessert cart.BOBOVery good.

               Bobo goes. Loretta is surprised.LORETTAYou never have dessert.MR. JOHNNYNever is a long time.

               Mr. Johnny is uneasy. He massages his head.LORETTAWhat's the matter?MR. JOHNNYMy scalp is not getting enough blood 
                         sometimes.

               Loretta looks at him strangely. Bobo rolls up the dessert 
               cart. WE SEE Loretta and Mr. Johnny through the frame of the 
               dessert cart. They turn and look at the desserts.MR. JOHNNYHave Something.LORETTAI shouldn't.MR. JOHNNYWill you marry me?LORETTAWhat?MR. JOHNNYWill you marry me?LORETTABobo, take the cart away.

                         a woman, you should kneel down.MR. JOHNNYAlright.

               Mr. Johnny slowly gets out of his chair. There's not enough 
               room for him to kneel down. He has to ask two off-duty PRO 
               WRESTLERS who are eating dinner to move their chairs. They 
               do so with bemused expressions. Their names are BOB and MOOK.SHY WAITER BRINGS PERRY A FRESH GLASS OF VODKA ASKS THE SHYWAITERPERRYIs that man praying?MR. JOHNNY ON HIS KNEES ADDRESSES LORETTAJOHNNYSo. Will you ma...LORETTA(interrupting)

               Mr. Johnny slowly stands up, brushes off his knees. The 
               restaurant has fallen utterly silent. Loretta smiles. They 
               embrace. Loretta kisses him quickly.A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN, SUSAN, IS MAUDLIN FROM THE PROPOSALBobo stands very near her table. She is about to applaud the

               The single sound dies abruptly in the silent room.LORETTA AND MR. JOHNNYMr. Johnny is in control now. He looks around once, regally.MR. JOHNNYBobo! The check!PERRY AND THE SHY WAITER LOOK AT MR. JOHNNY AND LORETTAPERRYI feel like I have just witnessed a

               gets in the car and drives out to the curb. He gets out and 
               goes back to lock the gates. As he does this, the Old Man 
               approaches the house with the Five dogs and the open umbrella.

               The Old Man and the Dogs go to the front door of the house.

               Cosmo goes to the door of his car. The two men, father and 
               son, see each other at the moment they grab their respective 
               door handles. They each raise a hand in greeting; it is the 
               same gesture for both men, an eccentric chopping motion.

               Then they open their respective doors. The Old Man disappears 
               within the house. Cosmo drives slowly away in his car.INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAYA RED-HOT, WELL-SEASONED CAST IRON FRYING PANReceives a big lump of butter with a hissing gasp of 
               satisfaction. A wooden spoon pushes the sinking lump around 
               until the pan is coated. Two square slices of yellow bread 
               with round holes punched in their middles land in the pan.

               Two circles of green pepper land next to the bread. A spatula 
               flips over the bread which has become glistening gold on the 
               cooked side.

               Two eggs are broken and dropped sunnyside into the holes in 
               the bread.

               The circles of green pepper are pushed around by the spatula, 
               scooped up deftly, and each is made to frame one of the eggs.

               A WOMAN'S HAND garnishes each bright yellow yolk with a slash 
               of red pimento. The spatula reappears and lifts the results 
               from the pan, and slides them onto two small dark blue plates.

               big, old-fashioned six range gas stove where an old speckled 
               coffee pot is steaming up a sun-drenched window. Rose comes 
               toward the table with the laden blue plates. She's wearing a 
               nice old apron over a blue housedress. She's thoughtful.

               As Rose comes to the table, Loretta in a blue denim work 
               shirt and pants, goes to the stove and gets the coffee. As 
               Rose puts breakfast on the table, she speaks to Loretta,

               is about thirty, trendily dressed, and French. Mer and Loretta 
               greet and talk. Loretta makes vague gestures trying to convey 
               what she wants, but the truth is she doesn't know what she 
               wants. Mer takes the situation in hand.

               There follows a MONTAGE of Mer showing Loretta various 
               dresses, some outlandish, some beautiful, some 
               incomprehensible. Loretta tries on several of the dresses in 
               a big triple mirror. Some horrify her, some frighten her 
               because they're so sexy, one bores her. We don't see the 
               dress that she ultimately does buy.EXT. INSINUATION - DUSKLoretta walks out with a big shopping bag. She walks away

               and looks at the bride. She walks close to the window and 
               stares in hard. Then she slowly backs up from the bride.

               Two NUNS are walking by. Loretta, backing up from the dummy, 
               bumps into the Nuns. She's flustered, makes a brief apology,

               She wheels it to a central place in the room. Satisfied, she 
               picks up her drink again, leaves the room for a moment, and 
               then returns with her shopping bag. She throws it on a chair.

               and splendidly lit, is the magical Metropolitan Opera House. 
               Two huge Chagalls, one to the right and one to the left,

               color.LORETTA COMES TO THE FOUNTAINThe fountain is quiet and dark now. Loretta is puzzled.

               She remembers that it was going. While she looks, it lights 
               up. Then small jets of water begin to appear. Then larger 
               jets.

               Then with a roar the central shaft of water rises high, higher 
               into the night sky. She follows the column of water with her 
               eyes up into the sky. Right above the crest of the water, 
               like a beanball on a seal's nose, is the moon.FROM OVER LORETTA'S SHOULDER WE SEE THE RUSHING WATERForming an opaque wall before her. Then the fountain, for 
               its next piece of aquatic choreography, drops away to nothing 
               quite suddenly. And there, facing Loretta, on the opposite 
               side of the fountain, is Ronny.

               He's looking incredibly handsome and dashing in a tuxedo and 
               topcoat and, of course, gloves. He smiles slightly and raises 
               a hand in greeting. Loretta, caught off guard, smiles 
               brilliantly at him. Then she remembers her situation and 
               starts to put on her usual serious expression. But the 
               fountain has rushed up into the sky again, obscuring her 
               attempt at composure from, Ronny.

               Ronny COMES INTO VIEW again, walking toward Loretta around

               and sees Loretta in her dress for the first time.

               and a pretty head of hair. This woman, whose name is SHEILA, 
               is having an argument with the man across from her.

               But the man's face is blocked by Sheila's back and head, and

               Bobo heads off for the bar. The couple at the next table 
               catches Rose's attention again, and their argument becomes a 
               little louder.SHEILA'S VOICEI'm trying to explain to you how I

               Bobo is gone. Rose is mildly intrigued with the argument at 
               the next table now. She tries to see past Sheila, to see the 
               man, but she can't without making too big a move. The argument 
               goes on.SHEILA'S VOICEI really do hate it though, when you 
                         take that tone with me. Like you're

               man's face. She pulls her coat off the back of her chair and 
               stalks off. This whole operation took about two seconds.

               When she stalks off, the face of the man becomes visible to 
               Rose for the first time. It's Perry, the professor in his 
               50's, who appeared and was treated in a similar way in the 
               earlier scene in this restaurant. His face is covered with 
               beads of water. He pats his face with his napkin and

                         from death and stood up and put on 
                         her clothes and began to cook for 
                         everyone in the house. The mourners. 
                         And me. And herself! She ate a meal 
                         that would choke a pig!ROSEThat's incredible.MR. JOHNNYYes.

               The front door can be HEARD SLAMMING, out of view, and then 
               Dogs can be HEARD BARKING. Mr. Johnny and Rose look to the 
               entranceway. The Old Man appears there, holding the Five 
               Dogs.ROSEHello Pop.

               The Old Man looks at Rose. He is a specter. He stares, and 
               then he makes a long low accusing NOISE. Then he disappears.MR. JOHNNYWho was that?ROSEThat was my father-in-law, who has a 
                         wrong idea in his head. Listen, 
                         Johnny, there's a question I want to 
                         ask you. And I want you to tell me 
                         the truth if you can. Why do men 
                         chase women?MR. JOHNNYWell. There's the Bible story. God 
                         took a rib from Adam and made Eve. 
                         Maybe men chase women to get the rib 
                         back. When God took the rib, he left 
                         a hole there, place where there used 
                         to be something. and the women have 
                         that. Maybe a man isn't complete as 
                         a man without a woman.ROSEBut why would a man need more than 
                         one woman?MR. JOHNNYI don't know. Maybe because he fears 
                         death.

               Rose leaps up, very excited.ROSEThat's it! That's the reason!MR. JOHNNYI don't know.ROSENo, that's really it. Thank you for 
                         answering my question.

               She's still in her clothes of the night before. She hasn't 
               slept. Her hair's a bit funny. And she's tormented by the 
               complications in her life. And, at the same time, she looks 
               great. She looks like she's been loved up and down. She has 
               a hickey on her neck. Her eyes are dreamy and her walk is 
               slow, utterly careless, and sexual. She's carrying, crunched 
               in her hand, her program from La Boheme. She starts SINGING.

               into the kitchen, goes to the tin table, and sits down.

               leather gloves. He has a love bite on his neck, too. He starts 
               to SING "O SOAVE FANCIULLA". He SINGS it any old way, 
               occasionally getting a good attack, occasionally just

               They SING till they get to the ceiling of the aria, and to a 
               resting place a little beyond. Then they nod to each other

                         Yes, I would like some oatmeal.

               Ronny and Loretta sit down and Rose serves them oatmeal.

               COSMO WALKS IN dressed for business. He regards the trio, 
               puts on his hat in shock and then takes it off again.ROSECosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's 
                         brother.COSMOHis brother.

               Cosmo sits down. Rose puts a bowl of oatmeal in front of 
               him. He absently begins to eat it. A silence reigns. Then he 
               puls down his spoon.COSMOYou're Johnny's brother?RONNYYeah.

               Cosmo picks up his spoon and they all eat silently once more.

               The SOUND OF DOGS BARKING comes up and then fades away.THE OLD MAN WALKS INHe looks at the assemblage. The assemblage looks at him.

               He points at Rose. Then his pointing drifts to Cosmo and his 
               hand opens in a gesture of supplication.OLD MANI am old. The Old are not wanted. 
                         And what they say has no weight.

                         I'll pay for the whole thing.

               The Old Man lets go a great noise of relief, sits down at 
               the table, and waits. Rose brings him a bowl of oatmeal.

               He is content now, and eats his oatmeal with great relish.

               The others eat with a more meaningful silence. Rose puts 
               down her spoon. She looks at the table, but she is speaking 
               to Cosmo.ROSEHave I been a good wife?COSMOYes.ROSEI want you to stop seeing her.

               Everyone stops eating. A tremendous silence falls. An old 
               clock goes tick, tick, tick. Suddenly Cosmo smashes his fists 
               to the table and stands. He doesn't look at Rose during this. 
               Then slowly, he sits down.COSMOOkay.ROSEAnd go to confession.COSMO(still not looking at

               He slides his hand out and takes her hand. Slowly, he lifts 
               his eyes. Their eyes meet. It's the first time he's been 
               able to hold her gaze in this whole story. The DOORBELL RINGS.LORETTAIt's Johnny. I'll get it.

               Ronny and Loretta enter into a long kiss. The Old Man starts
