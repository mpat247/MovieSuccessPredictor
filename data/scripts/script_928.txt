               Repo Man theme music now begins playing. Map is shown in background 
               (green text on black background), zoomed in on Los Alamos, New 
               Mexico. While remaining credits are shown, the map travels to 
               Sante Fe, then Albuquerque, then begins following US66 west through 
               Arizona to California, finally ending up a few miles east of 
               Goffs (northwest of Needles).Green '64 Chevy Malibu

               Malibu is weaving down the highway in the desert, passes billboard 
               with motorcycle cop behind it. Cop pulls out behind Malibu.J. FRANK PARNELLForty-niner and his daughter Clementine. 
                         Oh my darlin, oh my darlin...Motorcycle cop pulls the car over, gets off motorcycle and raps

               The motorcycle cop walks around to the back of the car and opens 
               the trunk. The car has New Mexico license plates KBB-283. In 
               every scene after this when the plates are visible, they will 
               be 127-GBH.COUNTY SHERIFFAHHHHHH!The motorcycle cop gets disintegrated, leaving behind a pair 
               of flaming boots (a reference to the movie Timerider, which was 
               co-written and produced by Mike Nesmith). Parnell watches from 
               side mirror, where we see that the left side of his sunglasses 
               have no lens.J. FRANK PARNELLOh my darlin Clementine, you are lost

               Kevin chuckles

               Otto grabs Kevin by the front of his shirt, steps around him, 
               and pushes him into the stack of cans (this has been described 
               as a goof but it's clearly just a case of awkward staging used 
               to make the shot work).Louie pulls his gun.LOUIE(Basta!)KEVINYou gotta love getting fired from your 
                         job in a big way, Otto.MR. HUMPHRIESWhat are you laughing at? Louie, throw

               takes off his clip-on bow tie and tosses it back towards Louie. 
               Louie twirls his gun and puts it away. Note that the store aisle 
               is lined with nothing but generic products, plain black lettering 
               on white background. All products in movie from now on will have

               Jazz music plays on the radio. In almost all scenes inside of 
               Bud's car, Jazz music will be playing on the radio.In this sequence the background changes from day to night, back 
               to day, and back to night again (during the speed snorting scene) 
               even though the dialog seems continuous. I believe that this 
               was done intentionally to show the passage of time, but the disjointed 
               events are cut so smoothly as to make it seem like they goofed 
               the continuity. It's clearer in the TV version where there truly 
               is a break between the line about speed and the actual snorting.OTTOSo how much do I get paid, twenty-five 
                         buck a car.BUDPaid? You don't get paid. Are you kidding, 
                         you work on commission, that's better 
                         than getting paid.BUDMost cars you rip are worth two or three 
                         hundred dollars. Fifty thousand dollar 
                         Porsche (german pronounciation) might 
                         make ya five grand.BUDIt helps if you dress like a detective, 
                         too. Detectives dress kind of square. 
                         People think this guy is a cop. They're 
                         going to think you're packing something. 
                         They don't fuck (mess) with you so much.OTTOAre you?BUDAm I what?OTTOPackin' something.BUDHa. Only an asshole (a jackass) gets 
                         killed for a car. Guys who make it are
