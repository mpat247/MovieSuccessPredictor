          incidentally will never accept him as a neighbor, and COLIN
          briefly seems aware of this). (Don't be afraid to get a bit
          French here). He gets to his door, and starts to cry, and
          nearly crumples. But he gets the door open. He looks up and
          sees a gun. Behind it, stepping fast out of the shadows,

          dozen croissants, and DIGNAM goes down the expensive
          staircase, leaving the door to the apartment open. The
          strangest thing happens: a rat emerges and begins to eat the
          dead man's croissants. The rat hears something and runs so
