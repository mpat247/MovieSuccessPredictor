He simply stares back at her. Carol's finely honed features
compliment a face that at first glance is pretty,at a second
glance shows willful strength. Doc continues looking at
Carol.CAROL (CONT'D)I'm sorry.

across the room from the Secretary. He seems totally occupied
with his bookwork.NEAR THE ACCOUNTANT THREE MEN ARE SEATED ON A DAVENPORTThey are dressed casually; by the look of them they might be
anything at all but all three have commonality; they are
professionals.

ender.

out of his buttoned shirtsleeves...

Doc, inhibited by the closeness of the prison walls, kisses
her lightly, but with affection...CAROLYou want to drive?DOCMy license expired, let's get out of

grooving.AN OLDER COUPLE SIT ON THE BANK, THEIR FEET IN THE WATERCAROL SITS DOWN NOT TOO CLOSE. DOC IS SILENT FOR LONGmoments. Carol starts to speak but doesn't. He is
preoccupied, lost in his own thoughts.

Finally he stands, looking down at her. He slowly takes off
his coat, folds it, lays it on the grass, then turns and
starts walking towards a tree.

Suddenly he takes off his shoes, breaks into a run and dives
for the rope.

CAROL IS ALREADY ON HER FEET, HER SWEATER OFF, SHOES kicked
aside, she runs after him and hits the water with an awkward
splash. She is a brief second behind him.

THEY COME UP TOGETHER, AND HE LAUGHS WITH THE PURE JOY of
being free and alive. She joins him, in his laughter and with
their arms around each other, they turn as they are swept
down stream.INT. EL OSO CONDOMINIUM - NIGHTTHROUGH AN OPEN WINDOW A PORTION OF THE EXTERIOR BUILDING CANBE SEEN... The interior is cozy and Carol. Carol has lived

steam iron.

a .32 automatic. He is field stripping. There is a bowl of
peaches on the table.DOC(pointing to the poster)
          It doesn't look like that.CAROLWhat do you mean? You've never been
          there.DOCI've been there every day for the last

She crosses to him and gives him a hug, then returns to her
ironing.DOC (CONT'D)What's Beynon got set up?CAROLSmall town, small bank, big money.

She holds up some 11 by 14 photographs in front of him.DOCWhere did you get those?CAROLI've been doing my homework.DOCJust like old times?CAROLBetter than old times.DOCI hope so. I am not looking forward to
          another stretch.CAROLI made a mistake. I'll never make another

          What do you want for dinner?DOCWhisky and a peach.

She laughs softly, and goes to a cupboard and takes out four
bottles of whisky, four glasses and a bowl of ice. Doc smiles
at her and begins sampling.CAROL(as Doc eats a peach with a
               sharp knife)
          How does it taste?DOCJust the way I remembered.

Doc reaches across the table and touches her hand gently.DOC (CONT'D)You been okay?CAROLPretty good... Made a quick trip to

          That's not all of it.CAROLNo. It's been a long time.

A pause. He continues stroking her arm.DOCYou go out much?CAROLAfter four years and now the question
          comes up.DOCCouldn't handle it then. Now I can.CAROL(with warmth and a smile)
          I'm still here, Doc.

He stands, kisses her gently. She stands and they move toward
the stairs.INT. BEDROOMTHEY ENTER THE BEDROOM AND SIT SIDE BY SIDE ON THE DOUBLEbed. They both sit rigidly. Doc's eyes are on Carol, she
stares vacantly expectant.

Doc begins to unbutton her blouse, it comes undone with
agonizing slowness... Carol pulls her shoulders back helping
Doc drop the garment down to her waist.

Doc hesitates, then carefully touches her shoulder... her
hair... he kisses her... Doc gently eases himself away from
Carol.DOC(he is very tight)
          Oh Christ...

He again moves close... Doc reaches around to unsnap her bra
as Carol places both of her arms around him, holding him
tightly...(CONTINUED)14.CONTINUED:Doc unsnaps the top fastener, the second one catches, remains
unyielding... He closes his eyes for a second... The pressure
of the moment is again too intense for Doc. Once more he
pulls gently away from her. Carol looks at him, her eyes very
reassuring.DOC (CONT'D)(continuing)
          I guess I'm kind of...CAROLIt's all right.DOC(explaining the obvious)
          It's just been a while.CAROLWe've got time. We've got a lot of time.
          I can help you.

She stands, begins to remove her skirt.DOCWait... give me a minute.CAROLSure.

She sits beside him again, takes his hand in hers...DOCI'll be okay.CAROLListen, I'm just as nervous as you are.DOCReally?CAROLReally.

They look at one another. A pause. He kisses her; their
embrace pulls them back across the bed.CAROL (CONT'D)(continuing)

They start eating.DOCHow much does Beynon get?

A pause. Carol looks directly at Doc.CAROL$250,000 right off the top.DOCIs he straight?CAROLYou got the parole, didn't you?

He picks up a fork and looks through it, as if it is prison
bars. She takes his hand and gently takes the fork from him.(CONTINUED)16.CONTINUED:DOCThanks again.

          it. I got you out.

Carol begins to laugh softly.DOCWhy are you laughing?CAROLI laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just
          thinking of you made me laugh. I had a
          lot of that. And other times that wasn't
          enough. I had a lot of that too. I know
          you find it hard to believe, I'm happy
          just loving you.DOCThat doesn't hurt.CAROLBut sometimes I cried a lot too.DOC(trying to smile)
          I didn't. I just waited.CAROL(deeply moved)
          Want to cry now?

Doc smiling, still holding her hand, leads her from the
table.

The Accountant and Swain are with Beynon in the boat. Apart
from them two pedal boats come up behind Beynon's boat. Cully
and Hayhoe are in one, and two other men are pedalling along
in a boat numbered 13.DOCAll it takes is a long arm.BEYNONHard to judge how these things happen.
            The Parole Board almost never reverses
            their decisions.DOC(sarcastic)
            I guess it was because I was a model
            prisoner.BEYNONThis is the only time you and I meet in
            public. Any business with me, handle it
            with him...

toward the other two men.BEYNON (CONT'D)(continuing)

company... half a million... it's a family thing, the brother
of the bank director is on the board of directors at Con-Sol

gun...

turn to Rudy, eyes wide, helpless. Carol fumbles for the gun
in her purse.

Rudy extends his arm, ready to begin the execution. Doc
swings the suitcase around slowly, seemingly ready to face
Rudy's bullets... then he shoots Rudy in the middle of the
chest, Doc's .45 slug driving him backward.

Doc has concealed the pistol in his hand with the satchel. He
drops the suitcase with his first shot, FIRES again, blasting
Rudy in the middle. Two large holes now show at the chest of
Rudy's raincoat.

rear seat.

THE STATION WAGON is waved ahead without a second glance by
the Patrolman; Doc accelerates away from the roadblock...

The wagon continues moving down the road.EXT. A NARROW DIRT ROAD - LATE AFTERNOONTWO HOURS BEFORE SUNSET. A CHILL SOUTHWEST WIND is blowing.
The station wagon appears, moving slowly down the roadway,
bouncing along its rutted surface.

AT A SMALL INTERSECTION TWO MAIL BOXES STAND CLOSE to one
another. The name Beynon is printed in black paint on one of
the letter bins. Doc stops the wagon momentarily, looks at
the box, then turns down the indicated road.EXT. THE STATION WAGON - LATE AFTERNOONTHE STATION WAGON clears the crest of a sage brush hill and

Carol watches the gesture. Doc starts to open the car door,
then hesitates.DOCYou can wait here... I'll wrap it up
          fast.

DOC STEPS OUT OF THE WAGON, then pulls the leather suitcase
out of the back. He quietly shuts the car door and moves
around the side of the house, toward the barn/garage at the
rear.

HE LOOKS CAREFULLY around the area, his eyes searching for
signs of Beynon's men. Nothing seemingly amiss, he moves
toward the front door, tries it, moves away.

Doc crosses to the back screen door of the house. After
another moment, Doc quietly opens the screen door and enters
the house.INT. HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOONDOC MOVES THROUGH THE SERVICE PORCH/PANTRY and into the

DOC LOOKS STEADILY AT BEYNON for a moment,, sets the suitcase
down on the floor, then crosses to the sink, picks up a glass

a sip.BEYNONHello, McCoy.DOCBeynon.BEYNON(swishing the drink)

Beynon smiles and slops three fingers of whiskey into Doc's
glass.BEYNONHere. I understand the way you feel. As a
          matter of fact, you and I might share a
          great many feelings...

          I've always heard what a smart ass

Beynon pauses a moment. Doc looks steadily across the table
into BeynonTs eyes. Prom beyond there might be the quiet
sound of a screen door opening. Beynon gets out of the chair,
stands beside the table.(CONTINUED)46.CONTINUED:BEYNONLet's examine the situation. One, an

          strings I pulled.DOCI bet.

Doc senses a movement from the shadows behind Beynon. Turning
his head slightly, Doc can see Carol standing at the entrance
to the kitchen. She holds a .32 automatic... the pistol seems
to be pointed directly at Doc.BEYNONYou wouldn't have come here when you were
          eight3 Mr. McCoy.

CAROL FIRES the automatic. The big gun belches the full slip
in a stuttering EXPLOSION... the slide remains back and in an
ejected position.

BEYNON is driven back to the kitchen wall. He SHRIEKS aloud,
the noise strangely like laughter... his body flattens
against the surface, slips downward^ riddled by the big bore
slugs... Doc stands momentarily frozen against the overturned
table. He looks up from Beynon's crumpled body. Carol takes
two steps forward, then drops the automatic, sending it
clattering and spinning away across the floor.

DOC looks at Carol, their eyes find each other. He turns,
moves to the sink, splashes water across his face, then fills
a glass of water from the tap ... drinks it; he looks back at
her.

CAROL stands watching Doc, tears scream down her cheeks.

DOC crosses to Carol, takes her arm, picks up the gun, spent
shells and the suitcase, then leads her out of the kitchen
toward the back door. Beynon's body has slipped from sight,
only a few traces of blood show along the white wall.48.INT. PANEL TRUCK - DUSKRudy is driving along an open highway. Rudy mouths inane

Doc tears the orange auto park stub into fragments and drops
them into a trash bin without missing a stride.INT. TRAIN STATION - MORNINGCAROL IS STANDING IN A TICKET LINE THAT MOVES slowly foward.
She struggles, clutching the heavy, money laden suitcase and
her oversize purse between both arms. The line of ticket
buyers moves forward .just fast enough to make it impractical
to set the suitcase down. The station is ancient, vaultlike.
Baggage lockers line the perimeter of the lobby and extend
off into clumped rows within the wings of the station.

CAROL APPROACHES THE TICKET WINDOW. She places the suitcase
flush against the base of the counter and holds it tightly in
place with one leg. Carol pops open her purse... a clumsy
item in itself... as she lifts her wallet and the elderly
ticket-seller looks across to her.CAROLTwo day coach tickets -- on the Flyer.TICKET-SELLERThirty-four fifty-six with tax leaves in

Carol pays the tariff, places the tickets into her purse
along with the change. Wearily, she labors the satchel back
into her hand, then turns and begins to slowly walk down the
seemingly acres-wide station promenade.

NEAR A PORTICO WITHIN THE MAIN LOBBY, Carol sits
uncomfortably on a shiny wooden bench -- the suitcase rests
on the floor pressed tightly between her ankles. She glances
across the promenade walls, her eyes finding:A CLOCK READING: 9:40ON A LOBBY BENCH - LATERCAROL STARES ACROSS THE ROOM at the scattering of passengers
waiting on the wooden seats opposite from her.

Carol's nervous boredom increases; she looks down at her lap,
pretends to find something wrong with her nails and begins
rubbing the cuticles. Carol finally rises impulsively from
the bench, immediately reaching for the brown leather
satchel.(CONTINUED)51.CONTINUED:CAROL WALKS BACK DOWN THE PROMENADE while carrying   the
suitcase. As other baggage-laden passengers scurry   around
her, she looks across the arcade, her eyes finding   a glass-
walled Cocktail Lounge. She hesitates, then begins   to trudge
in that direction.

A BANK OF LOCKERS STANDS NEAR THE COCKTAIL LOUNGE. As Carol
approaches, an elderly WOMAN deposits a coin in one of the
numbered lockers, opens the metal door and places a small
suitcase inside. Closing and re-locking the door, the Woman
quickly moves away. Having noted the woman and more than
tired of hauling her burden around the station, Carol steps
to the end locker, takes a quarter out of her purse, then
studies the time scarred operating instructions on the face
of the locker. She slips the quarter into the slot and opens
the locker door. As Carol bends to pick up the suitcase, the
locker door swings closed... She tries to open it but the
door has re-locked itself... Carol quite disgusted with her
predicament, again sets the suitcase down and pulls a quarter
out of her change purse. As she again reads the numbered
directions, a YOUNG MAN appears at her shoulder.

THE MAN IS A PROTOTYPE OF URBAN SLEAZINESS, Doberman Pinscher
features are broken by a weedybrown moustache, a cheap
corduroy suit is set off by an oddly matched bow tie. The
Man's appearance suggests a kind of drug store dapperness.DAPPER MANKind of tricky, isn't it?

She turns, startled by his sudden proximity. In one smooth
movement the Dapper Man plucks the quarter from Carol's hand,
deposits it in the slot and swings the locker door open.
Setting the heavy suitcase inside, he closes the door, tests
it to show that it

has been re-locked, then removes the key from the lock and
puts it into Carol's hand. She is intimidated momentarily by
the Man's sudden appearance and forcefulness, as well as his
intentions.CAROLThank you.DAPPER MAN(toothy grin)
          No trouble lady.

Stepping backward, his canine features disappear into a
welter of station activity. Carol watches his receding figure
for a moment, then simultaneously placing the key into her
purse, she turns and begins moving towards the Cocktail
Lounge.52.INT. BARN - DAYEMPTY CAGES STACKED ALONG A WOODEN WALLA YOUNG KITTEN IN A CARDBOARD BOX wrestling with the barrel

RUDY BUTLER IS PREOCCUPIED WITH THE CAT, giving little
attention to the thirtyish Man standing nearby.

HAROLD CLINTON puts away a large syringe then snaps shut the
medical bag. Rudy lies across a cot in one corner of the barn-
like Animal Hospital. The large room is lined with stalls,
cages and pens, many of them vacant.

attached to his left arm and shoulder.

They cross to the lockers.

She retrieves the key from her purse and thrusts it into the
proper slot. It doesn't turn. Puzzled she tries again, then
forcing the key, shakes the lock violently.

Her eyes widening into a quiet panic, she next looks at the
locker number and then the number on the key. Her features

Walking at a rapid pace, they start through the station, Doc
forcing their speed, clutching Carol under her elbow. They
reach the main concourse after moving down the length of the
promenade... eyes straining.

CAROL STOPS SUDDENLY. SHE STARES DOWN THE LONG CORRIDOR her
eyes finding the thief. He stands near another bank of
lockers, the black suitcase at his feet.

THE THIEF LOOKS UP AT CAROL - virtually within the same
moment that she spots him. His expression never changes. He
takes a step towards her, smiling... Then, with a movement
that is both abrupt and casual, he snatches up the money bag
and disappears behind the constant traffic of train patrons.

DOC HAS SEEN THE THIEF. Recognizing the suitcase he moves
immediately after him. Carol follows Doc but is unable to
keep up. She watches as Doc vanishes behind the row of
lockers.

lockers; catching sight of the thief momentarily, he closes
in.

After a series of criss-crossed movements among the banked
locker corriders, Doc again loses sight of the thief as the
slender criminal dodges off onto a main passenger concourse.
Doc is faster and more agile than the thief, but the station
is unfamiliar territory to him. Both Doc and the Thief move
carefully, they must not arouse enough attention to make
themselves conspicuous, thus risking police interference.

THE THIEF HURRIES ALONG THE MAIN CONCOURSE weaving between
the incoming and departing passengers that dot the long
corridor.

off departure/arrival gates.

THE THIEF STEPS OFF THE CONCOURSE INTO GATE THREE, an open
stairway winding downward.

DOC FOLLOWS HIS QUARRY DOWN THE STAIRWAY to the train area
where he immediately skips over the winding ramp and onto the
loading platform. Emerging from the short tunnel, Doc isn't
surprised that the Thief is again nowhere in sight. Doc steps
behind a pillar -- he waits watchfully... After a moment or
two, the Thief edges out from behind another column and
starts back up the platform towards the concourse.(CONTINUED)60.CONTINUED:Doc moves quickly to intercept his opponent but, as the Thief

speaks to a nearby BRAKEMAN. The Thief skirts around a
baggage-laden elderly COUPLE and moves up the two-step and
into the rail car passageway.

DOC MOVING QUICKLY AGAIN. He sees the Thief slip past the
conductor and into the train.

THE THIEF IS NOW INSIDE THE DAY COACH. He heads toward the

disappears past the conductor up into the passenger car

take her down to trackside...

that Doc must carefully note the occupants of each seat as he

overhead carriage.

the sudden dead end of the passageway. The next car holds
only baggage. He has reached furthest forward passenger car.
The Thief desperately tries to open the vestibule door,
hoping to escape by jumping off the train, but the doors are
tightly locked. He begins to retrace his steps.

PORTER enter it moments after Doc leads the way. Doc passes
through the length of the car, moves into the vestibule and,
like the Thief a few moments before, finds his passage
blocked by the baggage car. Doc hesitates, then turns and
begins going back in the opposite direction.

a moment. He tries the handle. The door remains firmly shut.PORTER(appearing suddenly at Doc's

toward his point of entrance onto the train.

THE THIEF, HAVING ABANDONED THE JAMMED WINDOW, is now undoing
the snaps and straps holding the suitcase closed. The lid
pulls upward and stacks of money appear under his hands. The
Thief grabs a money pad, runs his thumb over it, then shoves
the stack of greenbacks into his coat's inside breast pocket.

back out into the vestibule.(CONTINUED)63.CONTINUED:AT THE BACK OF THE SMOKER, the Thief seats himself next to a
window and places the suitcase on the cushioned chair
opposite from him. In the forward position of the car, well
behind the Thief's back, a dozen Passengers are scattered
about the lounge chairs. A Conductor appears at the end of
the smoker opposite the Thief and begins to collect and punch
tickets.

As the train begins to pick up speed, the Thief lifts an
abandoned copy of the newpaper off the cushion next to him.
He glances at the front page, then unfolds the width of the
paper. As a precaution against regaining poverty, the Thief
rests one foot against the suitcase. All seems secure. Then,

Doc whips his pen knife out of his pocket, crosses the room
to the locked door of an adjoining hotel room. He begins
forcing the lock.CAROLJust leave it outside the door... I'm not
          dressed right now.

his pants.

CAROL thinking hard...CAROLAll right. You'll have to hold on a

DOC breaks the lock and opens the door -- he quickly crosses
the dark apartment, moves to the front door, slips out his
automatic, then gingerly cracks the door. His eyes tighten in
amazement as he sees:(CONTINUED)99.CONTINUED:RUDY STANDING SLIGHTLY BEHIND FRAN, his .44 held tightly up
to the door jamb, ready for instantaneous use. Rudy and Fran
are 15 feet down the hallway from Doc's slightly opened door.
They both have their backs turned to him in three-quarter
fashion.

DOC BAREFOOTED., BARE-CHESTED; he decides on a course of
action. The door swings quietly open.

WITHIN THE HALLWAY, DOC CLOSES THE DISTANCE between himself
and Rudy in two swift strides, Rudy turns,, swinging his gun,
too late, as Doc's .45 crashes against his head. Rudy drops.
Fran screams. Rudy looks at Doc, still smiling, eyes glazed.

He falls abruptly. Doc stands over the fallen body. Fran
continues to scream. Doc finally turns away from Rudy,
looking now at the screaming woman. He flattens her with a
left hook to the jaw. Fran drops to the floor as if she had
been shot. Suddenly everything in the corridor is silent.

RUDY'S HEAD IS BLOODIED. He lies without movement.DOC NOW SLAMS AT THE DOOR OF 318DOCOpen it up, it's me.

Accountant eyes both the empty lobby and the entrance to the
hotel3 acting as lookout.

off by the four opponents standing near the reception desk.
Carol edges backward a few steps, toward the massive wooden
staircase.ACCOUNTANTJust have her set it down.

As the three men reach for their guns.

DOC MOVES MUCH PASTER. HE DUCKS TO   THE RIGHT, levels the
disguised shotgun and fires in the   same movement. The
reception desk near the Accountant   splinters from the blast
and he is hit painfully. The other   three men duck away from
the sudden burst of fire power.DOC AND CAROL JUMP FOR THE STAIRSHAYHOE LEVELS HIS PISTOL AT THE RETREATING COUPLE Another
shot from Doc's riot gun... this one breaking open the floor
at Hayhoe's feet and cutting him down at the knees. Cannon,

miss their shots, digging up walls, stairs and flooring.

struggles with the heavy suitcase, Doc transfers the riot gun
to his left hand, pulls out the more accurate .45 to use with
his right.102.WITHIN THE LOBBY THE SIX MEN SPLIT FORCESCully and the Accountant run to the elevator, enter it, pull
the door shut. Swain and Hayhoe, limping, and Cannon and Max

All the men, save the Accountant, now have guns in their
hands.

SWAIN AND HAYHOE CAUTIOUSLY GOING UPWARD. Still below the
first level landing, their eyes search overhead. The SOUND of
Doc and Carol's pounding feet can be heard.

HAYHOE LEANS OUT OVER THE BANISTER, points his gun directly
up and fires.

DOC AND CAROL BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND FLOOR landings as
Hayhoe's bullet tears by, ripping through the wooden banister
supports.

shots back down the stairwell.

Hayhoe's leg buckles as a .45 slug tears through his hip, the
other bullet ripping the plaster wall near his shoulder.

SWAIN IS NOW BESIDE THE BANISTER, he points his 54l revolver
straight up... empties it.

DOC AND CAROL AS SWAIN'S BULLETS BREAK AROUND THEM. Doc pulls
Carol down, lifts the riot gun and fires down the stairwell
with a huge roar.

blast. Swain has to climb over the uprooted planking to
continue moving upward. Cannon following.THE ELEVATOR INDICATOR STOPPING AT "THREE"CULLY PULLS OPEN THE DOOR, MOVES OUT INTO THE corridor. The

Carol are being pursued up the stairwell, but he isn't aware
of the fact that the gunsels have split their forces.RUDY ON THE THIRD FLOOR AGAIN RISES LIKE LAZARUS FROM THEDEAD. His head bloodied from Doc's heavy pistol, he slowly
wobbles to his feet. Rudy looks down at Fran... she sobs
violently, her back leaning against the wall. Rudy picks up
his .44 then stumbles into the open door of Doc and Carol's
room. He unsteadily crosses to the bathroom, closes the door.

CAROL FRANTICALLY MOVING UPWARD, DOC HAS NOW FALLEN five
steps behind.DOC FIRES THE .45 DOWN THE STAIRWELL ATSWAIN ON THE THIRD FLOORCully walks cautiously down the corridor, pistol raised. He
moves toward the landing, having covered one quarter of the
distance from the elevator. The Accountant is still within
the elevator.

Carol comes up the stairwell and looks back for Doc. The
SOUND of Swain's pistol and Doc's answering .45. Carol senses
a movement; she turns and sees Cully's gun leveled at her. As
Carol screams:

Doc dives onto the landing facing the corridor... his plane
of movement knee high.,, the riot gun in his left hand, .45
in his right.

CULLY IS HIT IN THE CHEST BY BUCKSHOT. The killing wounds
fling him upward as he fires his own gun... his aim destroyed
by the death blows,, the bullets stray above Carol, high of
their mark.DOC FIRES THREE TIMES MORE AT THE ELEVATOR CABLETHE CORRIDOR WALL NEAR THE ELEVATOR IS SMASHED BY ONE OF the

preparing to jump.

RUDY COMES OUT OF THE ROOM ONTO THE FIRE ESCAPE holding his
.44. He looks down at Doc, then slowly raises his gun. Carol
screams.

DOC JUMPS. RUDY FIRES. DOC IS HIT IN THE SIDE (flesh wound).
In the air he spins and lands. Rudy fires again and again as
he runs down the fire escape. Doc rolls, picks up the shotgun
and fires.
