                                                November 17, 1987FADE IN:EXT.   SUBURBAN STREET--DAYVERONICA SAWYER, a sullen seventeen year old beauty is
     jogging down a suburban street in a stylish running outfit.
     Evocative female voices can be heard, softly wailing.EXT.   NEIGHBORHOOD PARK--DAYVERONICA lurches into a neighborhood park, running with an
     increasing sense of desperation. The female voices wail louder.EXT.   PROMENADE--DAYVERONICA whooshes past a series of shops and a movie theatre.EXT.   THE SAWYER HOME--DAYReveling in her own sweat and agony, VERONICA bounds onto
     the lawn of her impressive upper middle class home.

     She painfully rushes closer and closer to the front door as
     the female moans swell to a deafening summit. The evocative
     wailing cuts off as she grabs the doorknob.INY.   VERONICA'S BEDROOM--DAYVERONICA zips into a chic, but understated ensemble as she
     launches into voice-over narration.VERONICA (V.O.)Heather told me she teaches people
               Real Life.

     Composed and unsweaty, VERONICA fingers her bangs in the
     mirror then rambles off.INT.   HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY--DAYContinuing her narration, VERONICA glides through a bustling
     high school hallway with a frozen smile.VERONICA (V.O.)She said Real Life sucks Losers dry.
               If you want to fuck with the eagles,
               you have to learn to fly.OUTSIDE THE CAFETERIAWith her back turned to the viewer, VERONICA stands at the
     outskirts of the cafeteria entrance. The viewer's viewpoint
     approaches and finally curls around VERONICA to reveal that
     she is writing in a diary, wearing a monocle.VERONICA (V.O.)I said so you teach people how to
               spread their wings and fly. She
               said Yes.THE DIARY PAGEVERONICA'S pen sways across the diary page forming the words
     echoed by her voice-over.VERONICA (V.O.)I said You're Beautiful.

     A sudden off-screen bark from HEATHER MCNAMARA causes the pen
     to recklessly rocket across the written words.HEATHER MCNAMARA (O.S.)God, comeonVeronica!

     VERONICA coolly pops the monocle from her eye before angrily
     addressing the amusingly robust, conventionally beautiful,
     trendily coiffed HEATHER MCNAMARA.VERONICAWhat's your damage, Heather? You
               ruined my...HEATHER MCNAMARAGod, I'm so sure. Don't blame me,
               blame Heather. She told me to haul
               your ass into the caf pronto. Back
               me up, Heather.

     From behind HEATHER MCNAMARA emerges a similarly trendily
     accessorized but noticeably more inhibited waif, HEATHER DUKE.
     She is clutching a tattered copy of "The Catcher in the Rye."HEATHER DUKEYeah, she really wants to talk to you.VERONICAOkay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...INSIDE THE CAFETERIAVERONICA, flanked by HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE,
     strides into the lunchroom pandemonium.

     The stunning HEATHER CHANDLER turns from the tray before her
     toward her incoming comrades. She is dressed stylishly and
     expensively but not trendily; her hair, dramatically tied back.VERONICA(submissively)
               Hello, Heather.

     Pulling out a crumpled piece of yellow paper, HEATHER
     CHANDLER smiles. The content of what Heather says is
     consistently offensive but the tone in which she speaks
     is sexy, dangerous, and mysterious. She is a mythic bitch.HEATHER CHANDLERVeronica. Finally. Got a paper of
               Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge
               a hot and horny but realistically
               low-key note in Kurt's handwriting
               and we'll slip it into Martha
               Dumptruck's lunch tray.VERONICAShit, Heather. I don't have anything
               against Martha Dunnstock.HEATHER CHANDLERYou don't have anythingforher
               either. Come on, it'll be Very. The
               note'll give her shower nozzle
               masturbation material for weeks.VERONICAI'll think about it.HEATHER CHANDLER(looking off)
               Don't think.POV ON CAFETERIA LINEUnattractive and quite overweight, MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK
     guiltily plops two jellos on her tray and clunks forward in line.CAFETERIA ENTRANCEVERONICA's arm, seemingly involuntary, latches onto the
     outstretched pen.HEATHER CHANDLERSplendid. I'll dictate. Veronica
               needs something to write on.
               Heather, bend over.

     Both HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE bend over. HEATHER
     CHANDLER violently laughs.HEATHER CHANDLERHow nice. Two assholes: no waiting.

     HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE stand erect, embarrassed.HEATHER CHANDLERHeather Duke, back down.

     VERONICA scurries to the contorting HEATHER DUKE.HEATHER CHANDLERDear Martha, you're so sweet..THE JOCKS' TABLEThe traditionally handsome KURT KELLY, the serene black EARL
     FRAZIER and the massive RAM sit with other stereotypical
     Jocks taking in VERONICA and the HEATHERS.KURTIt'd be so righteous to be in a
               Veronica Sawyer-Heather Chandler
               sandwich. Punch it in, Ram.

     KURT and RAM raise their right arms and slam their fists
     together.RAMHell yes. I wanna set a Heather on
               my Johnson and just start spinning
               her like a fucking pinwheel.

     RAM makes a frantic spinning motion. EARL is bored.EARLShit. Right.RAMDamn right right.CAFETERIA ENTRANCEIn slow motion, VERONICA finishes the note and rises up
     along with her makeshift desk, HEATHER DUKE.

     HEATHER MCNAMARA hawkishly gazes toward the cafeteria line.

     VERONICA hands the note to an impressed HEATHER CHANDLER.

     MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK pays the CASHIER and then,
     grasping her lunch tray with both paws, moves toward
     VERONICA and the HEATHERS.

     HEATHER MCNAMARA excitedly tugs on HEATHER CHANDLER'S arm as
     MARTHA approaches. With a tranquil smile, HEATHER CHANDLER
     passes the note to her frantic disciple.

     In a self-consciously clandestine manner, HEATHER MCNAMARA
     saunters past MARTHA then wields around to sneakily tuck the
     note onto MARTHA's tray.

     The slow motion concludes as their plump victim shuffles
     past a magnetic preppie PETER DAWSON and a thin, black,
     bespectacled DENNIS. The guys are working a large stand
     which has a cashbox reading THE FAMINE FUND and a banner
     reading WESTERBURG FEEDS THE WORLD.PETERCome on people, let's give that
               leftover lunch money to people
               without lunches! Those tater tots
               you threw away today are a delicacy
               in Africa! They're Thanksgiving dinner!HEATHERS' TABLEThe Girls reach their table with HEATHER MCNAMARA and
     HEATHER DUKE sitting themselves down first.HEATHER MCNAMARA(looking to the stand)
               God, aren't they fed yet? Do they
               even have Thanksgiving in Africa?VERONICA(low key sarcasm)
               Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater
               tots; it's a real party continent.

     HEATHER CHANDLER draws up a clipboard.HEATHER CHANDLERSawyer. Guess what today is?VERONICAOuch....the lunchtime poll. So
               what's the question?HEATHER DUKEYeah, so what's the question?HEATHER CHANDLERGod-damn Heather, you were with me
               in Study Hall when I thought of it.
               Such a pillowcase.HEATHER DUKE(hurt)
               I forgot.

     VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER briskly bop away from the table
     as a wounded HEATHER DUKE retreats to The Catcher in the Rye.VERONICAHey, this question wouldn't be that
               bizarro thing you were babbling
               about over the phone last......HEATHER CHANDLERShut up, it is. I told Dennis if he
               gave me another topic that was
               political, I'd spew burrito chunks.

     VERONICA shakes her head and looks off. She's suddenly
     captured by the sight of a JAMES DEANESQUE GUY sitting stark
     in a long, tan gunslinger coat, behind aRebel Without aCauselunchbox. They make eye contact.

     Transfixed, VERONICA crashes into seated BETTY FINN, a slightly
     overweight, unstylishly dressed sweetie surrounded by clones.BETTYSorry Veronica.VERONICABetty Finn. Gosh.....

     VERONICA crouches down, embarrassed and rueful.VERONICAI'm really sorry I couldn't make it
               to your birthday party last month.BETTYThat's okay. Your Mom said you had
               a big date. Heck, I'd probably skip
               my own birthday party for a date.

     VERONICA gently laughs at BETTY's innocent awe.VERONICADon't say that.BETTYOh Ronnie, you have to look at
              what I dug up the other day.

     BETTY pulls from her purse a picture showing a YOUNG BETTY
     FINN AND VERONICA SAWYER, arm-in-arm, dressed in Halloween
     costumes: BETTY is an angel, VERONICA is a witch.

     VERONICA glows at the photo until HEATHER CHANDLER tows
     VERONICA away causing the picture to fall face up on the floor.VERONICAI was talking with someone!HEATHER CHANDLERColor me impressed. I thought you
               grew out of Betty Finn.THE COUNTRY CLUB KIDS' TABLEA coolly coed cabal of Country Club Kids icily eye the

     and brings the fork up.Thenote is wedged inside it.THE COUNTRY CLUB KIDS' TABLEHEATHER CHANDLER, Veronica in tow, hits the Country Club Kids
     with a salvo of false pleasantness, capped by a scowling smile.HEATHER CHANDLERHi Courtney. Love your blouse. Ooh,
               let me snare a tater.

     COURTNEY express elation in spite of yourself as HEATHER
     CHANDLER delicately takes a tot and turns around to face
     VERONICA. HEATHER CHANDLER inserts her finger in her mouth
     doing the "induce-vomiting" signal before devouring the tot
     and turning back around.COURTNEYThanks. I just got it last night at
               the Limited. Totally blew my allowance.

     HEATHER CHANDLER raises her clipboard. VERONICA closes her
     eyes and shakes her head with a half-smile.HEATHER CHANDLERThat's pretty very. Now check this out. You
               win five million dollars from Publishers
               Clearing House, but on the same day Ed

               land on earth and say they're going
               to blow up the world in two days.
               What would you do?

     A stunned tableau; until Country Club Kid KEITH speaks.KEITHThat's easy. I'd just slide that wad

     He wraps his fingers around an egg and unfolds them back.

               like my friends.J.D.I don't really like your friends either.VERONICAIt's like they're just people I

               have to believe.....damn pen!

     VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER's stylish garb clashes with the
     laid-back dress of the COLLEGE STUDENTS.

               Don't worry, we will. You're just so

               in the dorm.

     A BIG AMIABLE STUDENT approaches before VERONICA can show disgust.BIG AMIABLE STUDENTBrad-man, Robinson's looking for

               drinking and driving?VERONICAJeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?BRADHey, don't run away now.

     With a wink, BRAD squirms off. VERONICA dashes into the room
     with the coats.VERONICA'S BEDROOMVERONICA rampages through her diary.VERONICA (V.O.)Seventeen is the last year Mom buys

               understand I must stop Heather.DORM "COAT" ROOMPanting, VERONICA collapses at a desk in the "coat" room.
     She draws a Vodka bottle from a stockpile of liquor and pours
     some in her beer cup, slouching down in her chair.

     VERONICA lights a match from a 7-11 matchbook. She eerily
     brings her hand closer and closer to the fire until it touches.
     With an eek of pain, she tosses the match away into the Vodka
     cup, setting it afire. VERONICA laughs to herself before
     tossing the flaming cup out the window.EXT.   ALLEY OUTSIDE THE DORMITORY  NIGHTThe flaming cup lands in a large rusted garbage can filled
     with other cups and various refuse. The flames spread...INT.   DORMITORY BATHROOM  NIGHTA dejected HEATHER CHANDLER walks into a multi-mirror-and-sink

     VERONICA yanks up her coat from beneath BRAD on the bed
     causing him to slide off onto the floor.DORM HALLWAYVERONICA storms into the hallway but slows down when she
     sees she's attracting attention. She notices an incited
     BRAD slither to the smiling DAVID who chats with some
     STUDENTS, HEATHER CHANDLER on his arm.

     BRAD causes DAVID's smile to ever-so-slightly diminish.
     DAVID whispers to HEATHER CHANDLER who proceeds to set
     down her beer and walk toward VERONICA.DORMITORY ALLEYThe fire in the trashcan is raging.DORM HALLWAYA steel faced HEATHER CHANDLER comes face-to-face with VERONICA.HEATHER CHANDLERWhat's your damage? Brad says

     VERONICA'S eyes fall shut in a near-faint. She flings
     herself down off-screen with some ugly retching sounds.VERONICA'S BEDROOMVERONICA savagely scrawls in her diary, tears burning fierce.VERONICA (V.O.)Betty Finn was a true friend and I
               sold her out for a bunch of Swatchdogs

     VERONICA runs off as STUDENTS laugh in the background.DORMITORY ALLEYVERONICA charges into the alley. She whips around to face a
     screeching HEATHER CHANDLER. In back of VERONICA, the

     VERONICA is simultaneously dismayed and exhilarated. She seems
     ready to burst out all her anxieties but instead....VERONICASure. But I'm Blue.EXT.   THE SAWYER BACKYARD--LATE NIGHTThe viewer's viewpoint glides through the grass of Veronica's
     backyard uncovering combinations of wickets and articles of
     clothing. A pair of girls shoes and a pair of guys shoes rest
     together by the first wicket.J.D. (V.O.)Goddamn, no wonder you looked so
               mangled when I came through the window.

     Feminine socks and masculine socks lay crumpled by the next wicket.VERONICA (V.O.)I've always treated Heather's teen
               queen power plays as bullshit.....

     As VERONICA quiveringly pauses, a stylish blouse and a
     rugged shirt are revealed mingling by another wicket.VERONICA (V.O.)But I'm really scared. Who am I going
               to eat lunch with on Monday? I sound
               like an Afterschool Special.

     The viewer's viewpoint moves to a dress and a pair of jeans
     resting side by side at another wicket.J.D. (V.O.)That was my first game of Strip
               Croquet, you know. I thank you.VERONICA (V.O.)You're welcome. It's a lot more
               interesting than just flinging
               off your clothes and boning away
               on the neighbor's swing set.

     VERONICA'S blue mallet has been staked into the ground. Her
     panties hang on one end, J.D.'s underwear hangs on the other.J.D. (O.S.)Well, I don't know. There's
               something to be said for...Ouch!

     VERONICA and J.D. are finally revealed, entangled in an
     artful pose upon J.D.'s gunslinger coat. They warmly kiss.
     VERONICA breaks off to uneasily giggle.VERONICAWhat a night.

     J.D. gently bites in to VERONICA's neck. VERONICA grooves on
     it, closing her eyes tightly.VERONICAWhat a life. I almost moved into high
               school out of sixth grade because I
               was some genius. We all decided to
               chuck the idea because I'd have
               trouble making friends, blah-blah-blah.

     VERONICA slides her head down against J.D.'s chest and
     gracefully rests on his lap. Gently fighting slumber, she

               when she's not hungover.J.D.Then let's just concoct ourselves a
               little hangover cure that'll induce
               her to spew red, white, and blue.

     VERONICA opens the refrigerator. J.D. opens the cupboard
     beneath the sink.VERONICAWhat about orange juice and milk?
               What's the upchuck factor on that?

               kill her.

     VERONICA and J.D. make queasy eye-contact. VERONICA descends
     back into the refrigerator with some worked-up enthusiasm as
     J.D. suavely pours bits of various toxic containers (detergent,
     scouring powder) into a glass beer mug.VERONICAO-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put
               it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it

               shit. I say we go with Big Blue.

     J.D. raises the glass filled with what is now a strange blue
     liquid. VERONICA stares at the glass, scared by her own thoughts.VERONICAWhat are youdoing? You just
               can't go.....Besides, she'd never
               drink anything that looks like that.J.D.Okay we'll use this. She won't be
               able to tell what she's drinking.

     J.D. pulls down a ceramic cup and triumphantly pours the
     poisonously blue beer glass contents into it. An eerie pause
     ensues. VERONICA takes out a milk carton and a container of orange
     juice. She struts back to the counter in anger, icily muttering.VERONICAJust give me a cup, jerk.

     J.D. sheepishly pulls down an identical ceramic cup. VERONICA
     tears it from him and pours some milk and then some orange
     juice into the cup.VERONICAMilk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe
               we could cough a phlegm globber in
               it or something.J.D.Yeah, great.

     They both start coughing harshly.VERONICANo luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll
               do quite nicely. Quite nicely.J.D.Chick-en.VERONICAYou're not funny.

     J.D. turns on his heel and slinks away. VERONICA glares down at
     the mess of toxic containers. With both arms, VERONICA clumps
     the toxic containers together and drops beneath the sink to put
     them away. J.D. swaggers back into the kitchen as VERONICA bobs
     back into view.J.D.I'm sorry.

     J.D. kisses the back of her neck. VERONICA closes her eyes
     with a grudging smile.VERONICABonehead.

     HEATHER CHANDLER rises from the bed and struts to J.D. in anger.

     launches her head forward, her face contorted in agony.HEATHER CHANDLERCorn nuts!

     A BETTY FINN-A-LIKE moves up to the sink beside her. Two CHIC
     BABES enter the bathroom with pouting expressions. Seemingly
     in a trance, HEATHER DUKE bends over and wipes off her wet

     VEONCIA gigglingly shoots, but misses the wicket. And instead
     hits BETTY's ball. Disturbed by the sudden dilemma, she
     determinedly walks to her ball and moves it away from BETTY's.BETTYHey, you're not settling for the two
               shots are you? Knock me out girl.

     HEATHER DUKE walks toward the girls followed by a meandering
     desultory HEATHER MCNAMARA, who picks up a green mallet and
     fragilely swings it; her early robustness a forgotten memory.HEATHER MCNAMARACroquet won't be the same without Heather.

     HEATHER DUKE savagely "sends" HEATHER MACNAMARA's ball into
     the flower bed.HEATHER DUKEBack off. I called everyone, even that
               Stoner slut. Felt like giving my phone
               a bath. I told Betty just now...Damn!

     HEATHER DUKE's shot swerves wide of the wicket.VERONICAYou're so polluted. Talking down to

     VERONICA blows her shot.HEATHER DUKEI don't see what gives you the right
               to lecture,Ronnie. You were
               soulmates with Betty Finn until you
               realized you're the cover of
               Seventeen magazine and she's the
               before half of a Scarsdale Diet ad.

     HEATHER DUKE bashes her ball into VERONICA's and prepares
     to send it.HEATHER DUKESome people just don't matter. Why
               should those who do carry their
               weight? Am I right?

     As HEATHER DUKE swings down her mallet, VERONICA steps on her
     own ball. When HEATHER DUKE's mallet makes contact, the two
     balls slam against each other, unmoving, with a loud smack.VERONICANo, you're wrong. It's not even
               your turn.

     They burst through the studio double doors.STUDIOVERONICA and PETER take in a panorama of attractive, clean-cut
     STUDENTS from various schools chatting near Wine and Cheese

               were going to get equal representation
               on this thind: Geeks, Gearheads...

     Out of nowhere, a bubbling HEATHER DUKE knots a pink armband
     around PETER's arm with a giggle.HEATHER DUKEThey're probably just being
               fashionably late.

     PETER DAWSON prances off with a raucous laugh. VERONICA stares
     dumbfounded at the wicked homogeneity of the STUDENTS as HEATHER
     DUKE ties a pink armband on her.HEATHER DUKEIs this very or what? Oh, you've
               gotta meet Whitney James! Come on!

     HEATHER DUKE tugs VERONICA across the crowded studio floor to
     where the WETC news set is situated. Smoking casually in her
     anchor's chair is the beautiful WHITNEY JAMES.HEATHER DUKEWhitney, here's my friend.....WHITNEY JAMESAh please sit down.

     HEATHER DUKE glides away. VERONICA uncomfortably steps onto
     the news set and moves down next to WHITNEY JAMES.WHITNEY JAMESI got a confession to make. My name
               used to be Heather, too.VERONICABut my name's not...WHITNEY JAMESPeople just don't take the name Heather

               The minute you try to deal with the actual
               teenagers who have contemplated suicide
               you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand
               filled with bad complexions, bad grades,
               bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of
               doody nobody wants to hear let alone
               bend down to clean up.

     WHITNEY JAMES tears open a bag of Corn Nuts and showers some
     into her mouth. She speaks as she sucks and chews.WHITNEY JAMESI'm not knocking teen suicide. It's
               exciting stuff. My personal faves
               are those kids from loaded families
               grabbing the mike to whine how even
               though they bagged a B.M.W. on their
               birthday, they're still quote-unquote
               depressed. It's ridiculous. People who
               say money can't buy happiness don't
               know where to shop.

     lights suddenly pop on, momentarily blinding her. PAULINE

               Could we get some more light up here?THE STAGEThe pink armbanded Aryan youths form a circle on the circular stage.
     Pauline moves to a microphone at the center stage beside a
     seated WHITNEY JAMES who's tuning her electric guitar.

     VERONICA helplessly stands between the circle of STUDENTS and
     the two female hosts as the cameras go on. PAULINE sings/speaks
     into the microphone while WHITNEY JAMES strums her guitar.PAULINEOur schools have been torn apart by
               tragedy. Let's fuse them back together

               like adove.

     The students sthereally reach out to each other and clasp
     hands. VERONICA quivers for a moment then bursts through
     a handholding HEATHER DUKE and HEATHER MCNAMARA and off the stage.PAULINE (O.S.)Let's begin a new happiness...

     VERONICA swaggers past a seated TECHNICIAN. He pushes up a
     console lever causing the outer edge of the stage, where the
     circle of hand-holding students is, to slowly spin around
     the singing PAULINE and the strumming WHITNEY JAMES.PAULINE...with no more suicide...STUDENTS(eeriely)
               Oh yeah...

     Ripping off her pink armband, VERONICA freezes. Standing at
     the wine and cheese table, gunslinger coat and all, is J.D.
     He turns around and raises his wine glass for a gleeful toast.J.D.Holy traumatic experiences, Batman.
               I'm sorry you felt you had to put
               yourself through all that shit. I

     Devastated,  VERONICA sways back toward the TECHNICIAN's console.VERONICAOh yeah.

     VERONICA slams the lever back down forcing the spinning circle
     of handholding, pink-armbanded STUDENTS to crash to the ground
     around a taken-aback PAULINE and WHITNEY JAMES.J.D.Cute.

     WHITNEY JAMES playfully lets off a Hendrixian riff before
     coolly leaning over to her microphone.WHITNEY JAMESLet's go for another take.OUTSIDE STUDIO DOORSVERONICA bursts through the studio doors, panting rapidly. She

     his legs suavely crossed as he was before Veronica began
     dreaming. J.D. finishes his cigarette and pulls out a gun. He
     checks the bullets, puts the gun back in his coat, and heads

               Veronica! Dinner!VERONICA'S BEDROOMJ.D. crawls through VERONICA's window. Hanging from the
     rafter, neck in a noose of bedshoots, is VERONICA.INT.   THE SAWYER DINNER TABLEMOM sets a glass of milk at VERONICA's place, distressed.MOMHoney?VERONICA'S BEDROOMJ.D. paces the room, sweating and ranting, waving a gun in
     one hand, the Barbie doll in the other.J.D.I can't believe you did it. I was
               teasing. I loved you. Sure, I climbed
               up here to kill you, but first I was
               going to try and get you back. With
               amazing petition.

     J.D. throws the gun on the bed and pulls from his coat the
     computer printout sheet petition, then savagely rolls it out
     on the floor. It is filled with signatures of different
     sizes, styles, and colors. J.F.K. blinks.J.D.It's a shame you can't see what our
               fellow students really signed.

     J.D. flicks open a switchblade. He runs the blade beneath
     the typed paragraph at the top causing it to peel off,
     reavealing another typed paragraph.J.D.Listen. "We students of Westerburg
               High will die. Today. Our burning
               bodies will be the ultimate protest
               to a society that degrades is. Fuck
               you all." Not that subtle but neither's
               blowing up the school. Talk about your
               suicide pacts. When our school explodes
               tomorrow, it's going to be the kind of
               thing that infects a generation. A
               Woodstock for the 80's. Damn, we
               coulda toasted marshmallows together.MOM (O.S.)Honey, are you all right in there?

     J.D. swiftly picks up the petition and heads out the window.
     MOM enters the room and, seeing her hanging daughter,
     launches into frantic screams.MOMOh God, I knew it! No, no! I want my
               baby back! I should have let you keep
               that job at the mall. I was just afraid
               of you coming home alone at night!

     VERONICA opens her eyes.MOMI made your favorite! Spaghetti!
               Lots of oregano!

     VERONICA undos the noose around her neck but still remains
     hanging for the rope runs all the way down her back beneath
     her blazer and is tied around her waist. She undos the waist-
     knot and lands on her bed. She quickly puts a small pillow
     over the left-behind gun, unnoticed by her dazed MOM.VERONICAHey Mom, why so tense?THE SAWYER DINNER TABLEMontage music plays as VERONICA rears up from her dinner

     A passing PAULINE FLEMING screeches to a halt, grabbing VERONICA
     as she chokes on some styrofoam cup coffee.PAULINEVeronica! J.D. told me you
               committed suicide last night!VERONICAWhere is he? Where's J.D.?PAULINEWe have to talk.  Whether to kill

               decisions a teenager has to make.VERONICAGet a job.

     VERONICA storms away to her nearby locker. She swirls her locker
     combination and opens it. She glances down the hall and freezes.

     In the distance, J.D. moves mechanically down the hallway
     carrying a large gym bag, wearing a Walkman.

     VERONICA climbs into her locker. She closes it until it is
     barely perceptibly ajar. J.D. strides past the locker and into
     the Boys bathroom.BOYS BATHROOMJ.D smoothly moves into a stall and closes the door. He
     turns off his Walkman and ends the Montage music.THE HALLWAYThe hallway slowly clears as STUDENTS go to class. The bell
     rings. A LATE STUDENT races through the empty hallway.

     VERONICA carefully hatches out of her locker. She treads down
     the hallway as if something were about to jump out at her.THE GYMA group of cheerleaders including HEATHER MCNAMARA are lazily
     doing cartwheels on the gym floor. On a small stage set up
     beside them, other STUDENTS are putting up folding chairs.
     PRINCIPAL GOWAN says "Testing" into a microphone.

     J.D., toting the gym bag, quietly opens the gym door and slips
     inside. He swiftly moves unnoticed to a position underneath
     the bleachers.THE HALLWAYVERONICA peers around a corner to see an empty hallway.UNDER THE BLEACHERSUsing heavy black masking tape, J.D. tapes a thermal bomb to a
     steel support beneath the bleachers. Other thermal bombs can
     be discerned taped to other supports.THE EMPTY HALLWAYVERONICA cautiously treads down the empty hallway, trying to
     keep in control. Suddenly, packs of STUDENTS burst from
     classroom doors behind VERONICA. The excited swarms of
     STUDENTS move toward and past VERONICA, who has braked her
     troubled treading to stiffly contemplate her passing peers.
     She latches onto Geek RODNEY in a panic. RODNEY looks down at
     his clutched arm with a nervous smile.VERONICARodney, where's everybody going?RODNEYIt's Friday.....VERONICAOh my God, the damn pep assembly....RODNEYYeah, these things are pretty artificial,
               but at least we all get out of class...

     VERONICA ignores RODNEY's amiable attemots at conversation to
     inquisitively move forward through the crowd.THE GYMJ.D. darts from out underneath the bleachers to the gym doors.
     He pops the doors open and sees the crowd of STUDENTS move
     toward the gym. He suavely pauses then dashes down a nearby
     set of stairs.THE HALLWAY LEADING TO THE GYMVERONICA continues to tensely surf the tidal wave of STUDENTS
     heading for the gymnasium. She stops to watch her classmates
     file into the gym like lemmings with increasing sense of
     dread. She again latches onto a passing RODNEY.VERONICARodney, what's underneath the gym?

     RODNEY (unconsciously) dramatically stops, turns to VERONICA.
     and says........RODNEYThe boiler room.

     VERONICA blanches then lunges through the crowd. She topples a
     couple disgruntled STUDENTS before careening down the
     staircase beside the gym.HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE BOILER ROOMJ.D. walks by the firm glass windows of the boiler room,
     eyeing the pounding generators inside. He stops at a heavy
     steel door. Placing down his gym bag, J.D. proceeds to swiftly
     pick the lock. He swings open the steel door.VERONICA (O.S.)May I see your hall pass?

     J.D. weilds around. A sweating VERONICA moves toward him,
     pointing the bedroom gun at him.J.D.I knew that loose was too noose! I
               mean, noose too loose! Goddamn you!VERONICALike father, like son. A serious-as-
               fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll
               set off a pack of thermals upstairs.
               Okay, so let's start by slowly putting
               the bomb down on the ground.

     J.D. looks down at the gym bag already on the ground. He
     folds his arms and smiles. VERONICA forcefully moves closer.VERONICAOkay, okay. I knew that. I knew that.
               Put your hands on your head.J.D.You didn't say Simon Says.

     J.D. suddenly kicks out into VERONICA's stomach, doubling her
     over and causing her to drop the gun. J.D. gracefully
     retrieves it.THE GYMThe pep assembly is in full swing with rowdy STUDENTS in the
     bleachers earthily shouting, giggling cheerleaders making
     swaying pyramids, valiant band members struggling to be heard.
     Various Jocks, including EARL, stand on the stage with
     PRINCIPAL GOWAN as a YEARBOOK PHOTOGRAPHER flashes away.THE HALLWAY BEFORE THE BOILER ROOMVERONICA bends over quivering and clutching her bruised ribs.
     J.D. raises the gun to her head.J.D.Live by the sword...

     VERONICA swings her left arm up knocking J.D.'s gun hand
     upward. She then sails her right fist into his face. The blow
     annoys him more than it hurts him but J.D.'s momentary loss of
     composure allows VERONICA to come in with another much harder
     right hook. The blow sends J.D. stumbling back against the
     boiler room, jarring the gun loose.

     They simultaneously lunge for the gun. VERONICA, having the
     better grip, pulls so forecfully that after wrenching the gun
     from J.D., she loses control of it, flinging it down the hall.
     VERONICA pops up to retrieve it but J.D. moves his legs
     scissors-style around her and trips her.THE PREP ASSEMBLYThe assembly mindlessly blares on. Cheerleader HEATHER
     MCNAMARA rah-rah-rahs. RODNEY and the other Geeks pass around
     a pair of opera glasses, all intensely scoping out the
     cheerleaders. A group of STONERS toke away beneath the
     bleachers, one of them lackadaisically leaning against a
     thermal bomb.THE BOILER ROOM HALLWAYA snarling J.D. stands up, pulling VERONICA with him.J.D.You think just because you started
               this thing, you can end it?

     J.D. violently kisses/bites VERONICA. While kissing, VERONICA
     sees a fire alarm on a nearby wall. She closes her eyes then
     savagely knees J.D. in the groin. VERONICA bolts to the alarm
     and pulls it down. Nothing happens. J.D. gasps.J.D.You, really didn't think I'd, forget,
               forget, to disconnect the....

     VERONICA rockets her body down and picks up the gun. J.D.
     grabs her and throws her against the steel boiler room door.

     A jostled VERONICA raises the gun. J.D. howls then bounds
     toward VERONICA, causing them both to careen down the steel
     steps of the boiler room. At the same time, he inadvertently
     kicks the gym bag/bomb down along with them. The gun spins
     from VERONICA's hand and slides away. The bomb flies out of
     the bag onto the boiler room floor. A digital clock on
     the bomb clicks on at 5:00....4:59....4:58...THE PEP ASSEMBLYThe frenzied pep assembly crowd is now doing "The Wave". BETTY
     FINN and her similar co-horts deliriously get into the act,
     all sit in a circle at the bottom rows of the bleachers,
     pouting as STUDENTS bounce up and down around them. EARL and
     the other Jocks stand on the stage grinning and preening
     before the crowd.THE BOILER ROOMVERONICA and J.D. are in a heap at the bottom of the boiler
     room steps. VERONICA faintly works into a semi-sitting
     position and gives an astonished glance to the bomb, its
     digital clock clicking to 3:00. VERONICA crawls to the gun and
     levels it at a rousing-up J.D.VERONICAThe bomb's gone on, J.D.! How do
               you turn it off? Tell me!

     Fully standing, J.D. flicks open his switchblade. He gives
     VERONICA "the finger," screaming in exploded saliva...J.D.Fuck you!

     Seething, VERONICA shoots up at J.D. blowing off "the finger."
     Shrieking in pain, J.D. drops the knife to hold this sudden
     geyser of blood. VERONICA achingly stands, pointing the gun.
     The bomb clicks down to 2:25.VERONICAIt's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.J.D.You want to wipe the slate clean as
               much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am
               killing everyone in the school
               because nobody loves me. You have a
               purpose though! Remember? Let's face
               it, the only place different social
               types can genuinely get along with
               each other is in heaven.

     VERONICA fires the gun at J.D.'s feet. The bomb clicks to 1:49.VERONICAHow do you turn the fucker off?J.D.You're not listening. People are
               going to look at the ashes of
               Westerburg and say there's a school
               that self-destructed not because
               society didn't care, but because
               that schoolwassociety. Is that
               deep or what? I'll let you put it in
               your diary, babe. Free of charge.VERONICAThe bomb, asshole!J.D.Just push the red button twice.
               That's what stops it. If that's
               what you want, babe?VERONICAYou know what I want, babe?J.D.What?

     VERONICA fires the gun twice into J.D.'s throat. Coughing and
     moaning, he splatters against a generator.VERONICACool guys like you out of my life.

     VERONICA saunters to J.D.'s writhing body.VERONICABut babe, don't worry, these here
               were Ich Luge bullets.

     J.D. closes his eyes and slumps to the ground. VERONICA turns
     to the bomb and crouches over it. A lit green light is next to
     a green button. Above it, an unlit red light is next to a red
     button. The bomb's digital clock clicks to 00:17. VERONICA
     presses the red button twice, turning on the red light and
     stopping the clock. VERONICA falls back into a sitting
     position and sorely exhales, tears streaming down her face.THE PEP ASSEMBLYA cheerleader does a cartwheel in slow motion as eerie music
     plays. The manic crowd in the bleachers vibrates in slow
     motion as well.

     At normal speed, VERONICA walks to the doors of the Gym and
     peers in. The panorama of roaring students, posing jocks, and
     prancing cheerleaders continues to unfold in slow motion.
     VERONICA walks away from the gym.EXT.   THE FRONT OF THE SCHOOL   DAYVERONICA wearily pushes open the front door and emerges
     outside of the school. She closes her eyes to therapeutically
     bask in the sun's rays. A slight smile trembles onto her face.
     A strange voice kills it.J.D. (O.S.)Color me impressed.

     J.D. stands starkly in the distance before her, blood spurting
     from his throat onto his gunslinger coat. He painfully speaks
     through his assasinated vocal cords.J.D.You really fucked me up, Veronica.VERONICA(vertigo city)
               I thought I...you..J.D.You've got power, Veronica. Power I
               didn't think you had. The slate is
               clean.

     J.D. pulls open his coat revealing that the bomb is attached to
     his torso. The green light is on and the clock says 00:10..00:09.J.D.Pretend I did blow up the school. All
               the schools. Now that you're dead,
               what are you gonna do with your life?

     VERONICA takes the unlit cigrette from her blazer pocket and
     puts it in her mouth. She then folsd her arms.VERONICAPerfecto.

     J.D. raises his arms in a crucifixion pose as the bomb clicks
     to 0:00. Nothing happens. An annoyed J.D. breaks out of his
     crucifixion stance and raps the bomb with his palm.THE PEP ASSEMBLYThe sound of the bomb explosion plunges the cheering up-and-
     down pep assembly into chaos. Wailing students pour out of the
     bleachers screaming less out of fear than a "Whoa Dude" sense
     of excitement.THE FRONT OF THE SCHOOLVERONICA stands in the same position in front of the school
     with her arms still folded. Only now her cigarette is lit and
     her face and clothes are blackened in ash. Flames flicker in
     bushes behind her. VERONICA drags on the cigarette and turns
     to go inside.INT.   THE FRONT HALLWAYVERONICA strolls into the school and into a hallway of howling
     students, some of whom are tearing down Prom banners for the
     thrill of it. HEATHER DUKE rushes up to VERONICA and grimaces.HEATHER DUKEVeronica, you look like hell.VERONICAYeah, I just got back.

     VERONICA tosses away the cigarette. She then grabs HEATHER
     DUKE by the shoulders and forcibly turns her around.HEATHER DUKEWhat are you doing?VERONICAHeather, my love, there's a
               new sheriff in town.

     VERONICA takes off HEATHER DUKE's red ribbon and ties it
     around the hair of her own head. She kisses HEATHER DUKE on
     the cheek, leaving a black stain. VERONICA calls off.VERONICAHey, Martha, wait up.

     MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK revealed to be in an electric
     wheelchair, brakes to a stop and looks to Veronica, confused.
     VERONICA walks up beside her. MARTHA starts up her wheelchair
     and accompanies VERONICA away into a deserted hallway.VERONICAMy date for the prom kind of flaked
               out on me, so I thought if you
               weren't doing anything that night
               we could go to the video store and
               rent some new releases or something.
               Maybe pop some popcorn.MARTHAI'd like that.VERONICASo would I.

     VERONICA and MARTHA continue gliding down the hall
     Bogart/Rains style.
