           there. Sorry. 
                         
           Bernie stands, awkwardly. He pats Cal on the shoulder, 
           lingers a beat too long, then simply turns and EXITS. 
                         
           Cal is left alone. He raises a finger at the Bartender.CALDo you have anything with a worm

           Jacob shakes his head. Jesus Christ. He says something 
           to THE WOMAN who currently sits at the table. She nods, 
           gets up and walks away.BACK TO CALAs the Bartender pours him a second shot. He's now

           long driveway runs parallel to the yard. A medium-sized

           you a lot. I had no intention of 
           falling for a married woman. I 
           just wanted someone to go to lunch 
           with who didn't make me want to 
           shoot myself in the face. But we 
           started having lunch, and talking, 
           and suddenly I was an accountant 
           who was popping out of bed in the 
           morning, excited to get to work. 
           That doesn't happen to
