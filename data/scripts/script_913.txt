              furiously on the porch of an URBAN HALFWAY HOUSE. She glances
              impatiently at her watch and presses her ear to her cell
              phone. As she exhales, WE HEAR the rumble of thunder.Irritated, she crams her cell phone into her bag.

              Kym's dad, PAUL BUCHMAN, a tired, prosperous man in his late
              50's steps around the car and trots up the porch steps. He is
              wearing a big smile and his glasses are foggy. They hug. Kym
              talks rapidly over his shoulder...KYMOh my god. Here you are. I thought
                           you were going to abandon me in
