          curb. She steps off the curb toward us --
          A TRUCK BARRELS into frame -- The long lens' flattened
          perspective makes it look like she's just been crushed. But
          the truck flashes by and she's fine. More traffic passes to
          and fro through the frame.CREDITS BEGIN OVER:2 EXT. ANOTHER CORNER. DAY. 2The LIGHT CHANGES and a crowded corner full of New Yorkers
          step off the curb and into the crosswalk -- Before the first
          foot lands on the street we go to SUPER SLOW MOTION as the
          mid-day work crowd crosses the street.3 EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS. DAY. 3MONTAGE -- Slow motion shots of New Yorkers, mid-day, all
          kinds, going all different ways, all over the city.
          CREDITS END with some high school kids with book bags,
          walking among the crowds.4 INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM. DAY. 4An 11th-grade math class at the Ralph Waldo Emerson School,
          one of the few remaining Manhattan '60s-inspired progressive
          schools. About twenty kids, mostly white secular Jewish. A
          sprinkling of black and Hispanic kids.
          The teacher, MR AARON, late 20s, is returning test papers.MR AARONAbrams... Allende...
          One after the other the students get up to collect their
          tests, glance at the results and drag themselves back to
          their chairs.
          On LISA COHEN, just 17. Not the best-looking girl in her
          class but definitely in the top five. She listens listlessly,
          somewhat bad-temperedly.MR AARON (CONT'D)Bernstein... Cohen...
          At "Cohen" LISA gets up and heads for the desk.
          LISA'S POV, closing in slowly on MR AARON who glances up at
          her as she approaches. Their eyes meet. Aaron has the classic
          handsome young teacher's no-nonsense expression on his face
          as she reaches out her hand --24 CONTINUED: 4LISAThank you, Mr Aaron.
          She walks back. On her test he's written: B- "SEE ME1"5 INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM. DAY. LATER. 5AFTER CLASS -- The last students go out as Mr Aaron gestures
          for Lisa to take a seat.MR AARONTake a seat, Lisa. I just wanna talk about
          your test for a minute.LISA(SITTING)Sure.MR AARONNow...I know you had a little help...LISAWell -- I mean -- I didn't cheat, if that's
          what you mean.MR AARONI'm just saying I know you had a little
          help.LISAA lot of people did.MR AARONBe that as it may --LISAI mean I'll take it over again if you want,
          but like, what would be the point?
          It's not like I'm ever gonna actually need
          to know this stuff in my daily life...MR AARONWell, Lisa, that's just not necessarily
          true. Haven't you ever developed an 
          interest in something you didn't initially
          think you were going to develop an interest
          in?LISAUm, no, not really.

                          
          Mr Aaron looks down for a moment to hide his amusement. Lisa
          looks at him with secret adoration. He looks up.35 CONTINUED: 5LISA (CONT'D)Anyway, it was open book. So what's the big
          difference-between using a book and like, I
          don't know, using somebody else's mind
          who's like, really good at math? It's not
          like this person did the whole test for me.MR AARONOh no?LISANo. I did some of it.
          She smiles at him. He is no longer smiling back.MR AARONWell, next time I'd appreciate it if you
          did all of it. OK?LISAYou are so fair.6 INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY. DAY. 6TRACKING LISA from behind as she walks through the halls past
          her fellow students. She walks through a door --7 EXT. ALLEY. DAY -- CONTINUOUS. 7-- where kids are smoking. Lots of butts on the ground. The
          walls covered with graffiti. Lisa goes to her friend BECKY 
          and takes out her cigarettes. A kid named KURT smokes nearby.BECKYWhat did he say to you?LISANothing. . .Mr Aaron and I have an
          understanding about my math problem.
          Becky laughs. Lisa laughs.LISA (CONT'D)He is so appealing.
          A long-haired kid comes out, followed by a somewhat preppier
          girl, KIRSTEN, and her look-alike friend LESLIE.KIRSTENOK, Mr Ferrar is such an asshole.KURTWhat'd he do, call on you?KIRSTENFuck you., Kurt.47 CONTINUED: 7LESLIEKirsten is really upset.KURTI'm sorry.KIRSTEN(TO LESLIE)Let me have one of those, will you?
          Leslie gives Kirsten a cigarette and lights it for her.BECKYKirsten, I didn't know you smoked.KIRSTENI don't. -I'm just really angry. (to Leslie)
           Check out what he. said to me last week.
          She drops her voice. They whisper and then both laugh. Lisa
          watches them.LESLIEAre you serious?
          Lisa overhears MONICA, an elegant 12th-grader, talking to
          some other girls seated on the steps.MONICA.I just don't think you can really know a
          guy until you've slept with him.
          Lisa, listening, is not so sure, but wouldn't know.8 INT. AMERICAN HISTORY CLASS. DAY. 8The class is taught by two teachers; MR KLEIN, 50s, and MR 
          LEWIS, 30s. On the blackboard are scrawled the words 
          "STRIKERS" "PINKERTONS" and "PREZ. McKINLEY."KLEIN.So the President of the United States,
          William B. McKinley, authorized the use of
          private detectives to break the strike, and
          they went out there and shot them down!
          Just like they did in Virginia, just like
          they did in Pennsylvania. Because they did
          not care! They did not care!LEWIS(low, rumbling)
          And that's basically it-That's basically
          all there is to say.KLEINAll right? Go ahead, uhhhhh: Becky.58 CONTINUED: 8BECKYWell, Mr Klein...I mean, was there ever a
          good President of the United States?
          There is some laughter from the students.KLEINI don't know, Becky. I think that's a good
          question. What do you think? You. Lionel.
          What do you think? Did we ever have a good
          President?LIONELUm...I don't know. I guess most of them
          have just been totally corrupt.- LEWISLisa?LISACan I just say, I'm not necessarily like a
          big fan of all the Presidents of the United
          States, especially the current one, but I
          still don't think its necessarily all that
          useful to categorize every President as
          universally corrupt, because that just
          seems very general to me. Especially if
          you're going to judge them by the standard
          of -- whatever they're supposed to
          traditionally be like in some mythical
          version of America that probably never
          existed to begin with.
          ANTHONY, an intellectual smart-ass, leans back in his chair.ANTHONYLisa has raised a salient point.
          There are some laughs from the class.9 EXT. SCHOOL. DAY. 9School is letting out. LISA walks away from the building. A
          short energetic kid named DARREN falls in step with her.DARRENHey, how'd you do?LISAOh hey Darren. It was fine. Thank you so
          much.DARRENSo he didn't give you a hard time or
          anything?69 CONTINUED: 9LISAWell, he knows I'm not planning to like, go
          into Mathematics or anything...He was
          totally cool about it. He's so cool.DARRENOh yeah, everybody loves Mr Aaron.LISAWhat's that supposed to mean?DARRENNothing. The man is very lovable.
          They stop at the corner.- DARREN (CONT'D)What are you doing now?LISAI was gonna go look for a cowboy hat.DARRENWhy would you want to buy a cowboy hat?LISABecause my Dad is supposed to take me and
          my brother to this ranch in New Mexico to
          go horseback riding, and I don't think it
          would be right to appear on horseback in
          New Mexico without the appropriate
          equestrian paraphernalia, Darren. You
          wouldn't understand these things.DARRENThat is a definite possibility.LISAAnyway... Thanks again...DARRENBefore you venture forth on your bizarre
          quest for a cowboy hat...?LISAYes, Darren?DARREN.what are you up to later? Like tonight.LISAI don't know.DARRENYou wanna go to a movie?79 CONTINUED: (2) 9LISAWhat do you mean, like on a date?DARRENNo, not on a date, just go to amovie.
          I don't know if it's a fucking date!LISAAll right. Calm down. What do you wanna
          see?DARRENI don't know, I don't even know what's
          playing! I don't know if it's a date!
          Let's just forget it! I hate the fuckin'
          movies anyway. They're just bullshit.

                          
          They're all bullshit!LISAOK, take it easy, I was just asking! I'm
          sorry!DARRENWhat if it was a date, anyway? Would that

                          
          be so horrendous?LISAOh my God. Are you like -- are you asking 
          me out? (Pause) Are you? (Pause) Hello...?
          Earth to Darren.DARRENI don't know. Yeah. I mean...I feel like
          we're already really close...LISAOh my God...DARREN.and I think we'd be a really good match -
          - What?LISANothing. This is -- Nothing.DARRENSo -- Yeah. I would. I mean, yes. I am.

                          
          Yes I am.LISAWow. I mean -- I am really flattered. But I
          would definitely not want to do anything to
          mess up our friendship.DARRENI view this as a way of strengthening our
          friendship.89 CONTINUED: (3) 9LISAIt would definitely change it...DARRENI know: It's a fairly dangerous move.LISAWell...I would definitely have to think 
          about this...DARRENAbsolutely. Give it some thought.LISAOK, I will. 
          Pause. He is looking at her like he wants something.LISA (CONT'D)Why do you look like that?DARRENLike what?LISAWhat do you want from me?DARRENNot a thing!LISAAll right. I'll see you later.DARRENAll right.
          She turns and walks away, pleased by the conversation.10 EXT. LISA'S STREET -- WEST '80S. DAY. 10Lisa walks down her street and lets herself into the prewar 
          apartment building.11 INT. COHEN APARTMENT. DAY. 11She lets herself into the narrow apartment. A long hall
          covered with framed pictures, photographs and play posters
          opens onto a cramped living room crammed with books, plays,
          and magazines. A stereo, TV and computer are stuck in the
          corners. Beyond this is the kitchen and another hallway
          leading to the bathrooms and bedrooms.LISAHello...!
          Lisa drops her bag-and goes into the kitchen. She opens the
          refrigerator. Her brother CURTIS, 11, comes in.911 CONTINUED: 11CURTISHi.LISAIs Mom home?CURTISShe went to the store.
          Lisa gets out some cold pizza and sits down with it.CURTIS (CONT'D)Use a plate.LISADon't be such a little fuckin' goody two-
          shoes. -CURTISFuck you.LISAPlease don't say "fuck," Curtis.CURTISYou just said it.LISAYeah, that's because I know what it means.CURTISSo do I.LISAUh, no you don't, Curtis. Take my word for
          it.CURTISWhat does it mean?
          She looks at him and speaks very slowly and deliberately.LISAIt's when a man puts his penis inside a
          woman's vagina and moves it around really
          fast until they both have an orgasm and he
          ejaculates sperm inside her body.
          Pause.CURTISNo it's not.LISAYes it is.1011 CONTINUED: (2) 11CURTISGross.LISA(RESUMES EATING)It is gross.
          She eats. He watches her.CURTISDo you want to play a game?LISANo.CURTISPlease!LISAI don't feel like it, Curtis. Quit bugging
          me.CURTISCan I have some pizza?
           She gives him a piece of pizza. He sits. They eat together.11A INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY. 11ACurtis is practicing the piano.12 INT. LISA'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM. 12Lisa, on her cell phone, rummages in her mother's bureau.
          During the following she finds a small supply of cash and
          steals forty dollars.LISA(On the phone)
          What are you up to tonight? . Nothing: 
          Darren wants me to go to the movies with
           him. You want to come? I guess around
           eight?13 EXT. BROADWAY. DAY. 13POV LISA: slowly passing by Broadway clothing store windows.
           No cowboy hats. She walks down Broadway window shopping,
           enjoying herself.14 EXT. ANTIQUE CLOTHING STORE. DAY. 14Through the window, we see Lisa talk to the pretty, mid-20s 
           SALESGIRL with an embroidered cowboy hat.14A TIME PERMITTING 14A1115 EXT. BROADWAY. DAY. 15As Lisa slowly passes-by and looks in various store windows.
          She stops and looks at some shoes.
          REFLECTED IN THE WINDOW, behind her, a city BUS pulls up to a
          bus stop and wheezes as the doors open.16 EXT/INT STREET/BUS. SIMULTANEOUS. 16The BUS DRIVER is wearing a cowboy hat. He is in his 30s and
          kind of good-looking. Past the disembarking passengers we see
          Lisa's back as she scans the shoe store.
          ON LISA -- She turns around and sees the Bus Driver. She sees
          his cowboy hat and just as the doors shut --LISA(TO DRIVER)Hey!
          The bus lurches away. Lisa takes off after it.
          IN THE BUS -- CLOSE on the Bus Driver, oblivious to Lisa, who
          we can see out the door and window, falling behind.
          ON THE STREET -- The bus falls behind a slow-moving car and
          Lisa catches up.
          IN THE BUS -- Lisa appears at the bus doors, waving and
          calling out. The Bus Driver sees her, smiles and waves back.
          ON THE STREET -- Lisa is running alongside the bus.LISA (CONT'D)Hey! Where'd you get your cowboy hat?
          IN THE BUS -- The Bus Driver can't hear her, but smiles at
          her with good-natured flirtatiousness.
          ON THE STREET -- The LIGHT at the curb turns YELLOW.
          THE SLOW-MOVING CAR in front of the bus floors it to make the
          light.
          THE BUS DRIVER sees his way is clear and steps on the gas.
          He turns and waves goodbye to Lisa. She points at her head
          and then at him. He smiles, not quite getting it.
          The LIGHT turns RED.
          Still looking at Lisa, the BUS DRIVER lifts the hat off his
          head in a farewell salute as.--

          THE BUS DRIVER slams on the BRAKES.
          POV LISA -- Monica is clipped by the huge bus and pulled
          tumbling underneath.
          LISA SCREAMS. Pedestrians all over turn around.
          MONICA is pulled and crunched in a horrible twisting tumble.
          Everything stops.
          TRACKING LISA fast as she runs across the street toward the
          accident. As she gets closer she sees Monica's leg sticking
          out from under the bus.
          Then with some confusion, she realizes that Monica herself is
          right in front of her, and that her blood is spreading
          everywhere. Monica is reaching out vaguely, unable to speak.
          She is making choking sounds.
          Lisa stands over her for a second, frozen. She crouches down
          and tries to do something but doesn't know what to do, where
          to put her hands. Other people start converging.
          IN THE BUS -- The Bus Driver puts the bus in Park, opens the
          door and rushes out.
          WE TRACK him as he comes around to where a crowd has already
          formed. He hangs back on the outside, but we break through

          in Holland, then nine years in Paris. After
          I finish university, I moved back to
          Colombia. So: when I'm speaking French,
          they think I'm Spanish. When I'm speaking
          Spanish, they think I'm french.JOANAnd what do you do, Ramon?RAMONI have a company: We design computer
          software to help companies in South
          American countries.that use an incompatible
          software, so the computers can't talk to
          each other. It's a big problem in Central
          and South America, where there is not
          usually so much coordination in computer
          communications. So right now there's a big
          opportunity for us, because for the big
          software companies it's still in the
          backwoods. That's changing already, but in
          the last ten years we have done extremely

          conscience, and then ends up ruining
          somebody's life, when I'm the one who was
          distracting him in the first place.MR AARONWhat does your being rich have to do with 
          anything?LISAYou know what I mean.- MR AARONNo, I don't.LISAOh my God, I don't mean literally rich. My
          Dad makes like one bad TV commercial like,
          every two years, and my Mom lives from
          like, voice-Over to Voice Over. I mean rich
          compared to the bus driver.MR AARONOK...But I still don't see what any of that 
          has to do with what you do or don't want to 
          tell the investigating officers about the
          accident you witnessed.LISANothing, I guess. I'm sorry. When you're
          raised to be a knee-jerk Liberal you tend
          to think about these things.
          Lionel and a girl open the door.MR AARONLionel? Tamara? It's gonna be five minutes.LIONELI just thought you'd want to know there's
          like a lot of people out here and it's 
          getting kind of hard to breathe.MR AARONYou better close that door now, Lionel.
          Lionel closes the door.MR AARON (CONT'D)All right: I have to let those guys in.
          I don't want to leave you hanging...If
          you're really hurtin'...we could get a cup
          of coffee after school...4364 CONTINUED: (2) 64LISAI'd do that.

Joan comes in dressed for the opera.JOANDoes this-make me look fat?LISAUm, a little.JOANWell, there's nothing I can do about it.LISAWhere are you going?JOANThe opera...!LISAWhy are you going to the opera?JOANIt turns out he's a really big opera
          fan...! Anyway, don't you think it's kind
          of fun? We should all go sometime.LISAUh, no thanks.JOANWhy not? I bet you'd like it.LISAI don't like that kind of singing.JOANBut you like classical music.LISAYes. That's true. But I don't like opera
          singing.4466 CONTINUED: 66JOAN LISABut when have you ever -- It's like their entire reason
          for existing is to prove how
          loud they can be. I don't
          really find that all that
          interesting.JOANYeah. I know what you mean. But it's not
          all like that. You like The Magic Flute.LISAOK. I guess I'm wrong. I guess I do like
          opera singing. I just didn't realize it.JOANWhat is the matter with you?LISANothing at all! Why are you pushing this? I
          don't want to go to the opera!JOANYes! OK! It's called an invitation. I'm not
          pushing anything! All you have say is "No
          thanks!"LISAI did! And then you were like, "Why not?"
          So then I told you, and then you started
          like, debating me! Like you assume I've 
          never thought this through for myself!
          Which I have! Many times!JOANOK, well, that was a really Contemptuous
          assumption on my part. I don't actually
          like the opera that much myself. But I'm
          trying to expand my mind. Maybe that's
          wrong! (Pause) I'm sorry. I guess I'm a
           little nervous about you guys meeting
          Ramon.LISAWhy? What's the big deal? Why are you so
          influenced by what me and Curtis think?
          What Curtis and I think.JOANBecause obviously if I'm seeing somebody
          new it would important to me that you guys
          would like him and that he like you. Why
          wouldn't I be nervous about that?LISAI guess you would. Withdrawn.4566 CONTINUED: (2) 66JOANHey...Why does everything I say annoy you?LISAJesus Christ, I'm just sitting here!JOANHere: you be me, and say anything, and I'll
          respond the way you've been responding to
          me this whole conversation.LISANo...!JOANGo ahead: say something to LISA
          me and I'll say something No! I'm not gonna do
          to you the way you say that.
          everything to me -- Why not?LISABecause it's dumb! I'm horrible! I get your
          point!JOAN(LIKE LISA)"OK, uh, whatever."LISAWas that supposed to be an imitation of me?JOAN ("")"Um, OK: Withdrawn."LISAWell, for someone who's supposed to be a 
          professional actress that's a pretty lame-
          ass impersonation of someone in your own
          family.
          Lisa shakes her head and watches the TV. Pause.JOANAre you coming to my opening night?LISAI will if I have to.
          Pause.JOANYou're a little cunt, do you know that?LISAYes. You're a big cunt.4666 CONTINUED: (3) 66JOANOK. Let's not start talking to each other
          that way.LISAYou just called me a cunt, Mom!JOANOK, I'm sorry I said that. LISA
          But if you're really Why? It's refreshing!SAYING --JOAN-- If you're really saying you're not aware
          that you've been really annoyed with me, or
          really irritable with me -- and it doesn't
          matter if_I express it exactly accurately:
          you know what I'm trying to say --!LISANot really.JOANif you're saying you're completely
          unaware of that, then I have to say I don't
          think you're being honest about it. Now
          maybe I'm doing something really horrible
          to you without being aware of it, but I
          have a show opening in two weeks, I'm very
          nervous about it, I'm seeing a new person
          and I'm obviously anxious about you and
          Curtis liking him -- whether you think I
          should be or not! -- you were involved in a
          horrible traumatic accident, you're going
          on this crazy horseback riding trip with
          your father --LISAOh my God!JOAN-- which sounds like a recipe for disaster
          to me! And on top of everything else, Lisa,
          ever since I told you about Ramon you've
          been treating me like I'm insane!LISAUm, I think you're exaggerating slightly.JOANNow what am I supposed to do?!LISAJUST --JOANWhat am I supposed to do?!4766 CONTINUED: (4) 66LISAJust stop whining about everything! It
          doesn't matter. Norte of that matters at
          all! You've been in a million plays, you
          always get freaked out because of what some
          dumb critic is gonna say about your dumb
          play, I don't frankly give a shit about
          Ramon or who you're going out with
          this week --JOANI never go out with anyone! LISA
          Don't talk to me that way! Right! I don't care!
          I've barely had a date in the
          last two years!LISA (CONT'D)But I don't care about any of this! It
          doesn't matter! Your boyfriend doesn't
          matter! Your play doesn't matter, except
          to you! I don't care about New Mexico,
          because to tell you the truth I'm probably
          not even going --JOANWhat do you mean?LISA-- and you want to know something else,
          Mom? There are more important problems in

                          
          the world than our relationship! There's a
          whole city out there full of people who are
          dying! So who cares if I like your fucking
          boyfriend? It's so trivial! Why are you
          bothering me about all this? It doesn't
          matter!!!

          Or should I have him wait downstairs...?LISADo whatever you want. I don't care!JOANI don't even know what we're talking about.LISAI know you don't. That's the problem.JOANOh give me a break.4867 EXT. LINCOLN CENTER. NIGHT. 67Ramon and Joan walk toward the Metropolitan Opera House.RAMONEverything is all right?JOANOh, yeah.

          instead?RAMONYou don't want to hear Norma?JOANNo -- I don't mean that. I just meant
          wouldn't it be funny if we just walked into

          went to see the Daniel Goldfarb play

          because of my demographic. And the odds are
          you're probably not gonna have to have an
          abortion either. And since this was your
          first time, it might as well be a basically
          happy memory instead of a shitty one.LISAI'm sorry. I'm not completely in control of

          and "Brava!"RAMONHow do you mean?JOANIt's just so pretentious. "Bravi!" "Bravi!"
          Why can't they just say "Bravo?"RAMONWell, it's the plural.JOANI know --RAMONIt's the plural of "bravo." It's what they
          say to acknowledge the ensemble.JOANNo, I know, I know it's correct, it just --
          don't you think there was something a 
          little pretentious about those people?RAMONPretentious?JOANI don't mean they didn't really enjoy
          it...But you know how you can really be
          enjoying something -- but you're also kind
          of looking around out of the corner of your
          eye -- because you know people are watching
          you enjoy it...? Does that make sense at
          all?RAMONYes, but I wouldn't say that it was
          pretentious. In Italian you say "Bravo" for 
          a man and "Brava" for a woman, and "Bravi"
          for the whole company.6181 CONTINUED: 81JOANUh huh? OK, I see what you mean.RAMONYou use the masculine for the male singer
          and the feminine for the female singer.JOANYeah...Anyway, I really enjoyed it. Thank

          You've worked too fucking hard for this
          show to be derailed now by the kind of
          bullshit I know has been going on around

          person working on this show who hasn't got
          somebody they want to say something to,
          including me. So I'm gonna start. Matthew?6283 CONTINUED: 83MATTHEW(SLOWLY)By "Matthew," I assume you mean me?GARYYes. I mean you.
          Matthew comes slowly into the middle of the circle.MATTHEWYes?GARYYou are probably one of the most talented
          kids who's ever performed at this school.
          But you're too Goddamn lazy, you think you
          can just waltz through this part, and it's
          pissing me off. Because this show cannot
          come together until you learn your fucking
          lines. OK? _MATTHEWSo you'd like me to memorize them.
          Everyone laughs.GARYYes, I'd like you to memorize them!
          Now. (Brightly) Your turn!MATTHEWBut I'm not mad at anyone. I just want
          everyone to think I'm a great guy.

          get such good grades and your family never
          has to worry about money, and your parents

          the circle with her.LISA (CONT'D)I know that I'm not who you want me to be
          to you. And I know how much I've hurt you.
          But I still can't believe it means we can't
          be friends anymore! So much has been
          happening to me this semester --DARREN(WITH UNDERSTANDING)I know. I know.LISA(IN TEARS)-- and it's like I can't even talk to

          They hug and cry. LESLIE raises her hand.GARYLeslie?LESLIECan I just say, I think this show is like
          two and a half seconds away from being
          fucking amazing, and if we could all just
          work together, instead of being AT each

          I feel really fucked over by some of the
          people in this room. I'm not saying I'm not
          gonna do my job, but for some reason, a lot
          of the actors in this show seem to think
          that this whole show is about them. And I
          think I speak for a lot of the techies when
          I say that I feel really unappreciated and
          basically fucked over. And I don't know if
          I can get over it. I don't. That's all.
          Nobody says anything. PAUL raises a hand. His pretty
          GIRLFRIEND is seated next to him.GARYYes, Paul?PAULYeah, I'm just playing in the band, you
          know? This is hicrh school. You know? I
          don't really feel a strong need to like,
          all be on the same team with everybody.
          I just want to come to rehearsals, do the
          show, go up on the roof and smoke some pot,
          and then like, go on home. I don't really
          wanna cry and hug anybody.

          Paul?PAULOK, Gary, man, I'll give you a little hug.
          No kissin' though.
          Gary charges over and hugs Paul. Everyone laughs and claps.
          Gary grabs Paul's face and kisses him on the cheek. Everyone
          is laughing.
          Lisa looks at Paul, who settles back with his girlfriend. He
          sees Lisa looking at him and gives her a little salute. Lisa
          catches DARREN's eye. He is looking at her with the unwelcome
          gaze of love. She looks away. His heart hardens against her.84 INT. COHEN KITCHEN. DAY. 84Lisa is at the breakfast table, looking through a stack of

          weird, but are you allowed to tell me how
          to get in touch with that woman's family?

          three weeks! One of Monica's neighbors gave
          the police my number and all of a sudden I
          am the focal point for all these
          arrangements! And I gotta tell you people,
          I didn't have any kind of relationship with
          Monica whatsoever, unless you want to count
          the fact that she held up my children's
          inheritance for fifteen years. I guess
          we're just supposed to forget about all
          that now. And I am more than willing. But
          the perso n you should be calling is Emily
          Morrison, who was Monica's friend and is
          the person who has been dealing with all of

          going to be a few close friends, and some
          clients I imagine...LISAOh so was she a lawyer?EMILYMonica? No. She was a social worker. She
          used to be, anyway. She had -- several
          careers.6987 CONTINUED: 87LISAWere you really good friends with her?EMILYYes I was.88 INT. COHEN APARTMENT. DAY. 88Joan is reading audition sides. Lisa passes through, dressed

          people are gathered. A mix of Upper West Siders, social
          workers, and Monica's multi-ethnic clients.EMILYHi. Are you Lisa?LISAYeah. Thank you so much for letting me
          come.EMILYWhy don't you come on in? We're about to
          start. Do you want anything to drink?LISAOh -- Um -- no thanks.EMILYWe have bad hors d'oeuvres and good hors
          d'oeuvres.LISAOh - that's quite all right, thank you.90 INT. EMILY'S LIVING ROOM. DAY. 90Everyone is seated on Emily's chairs and borrowed chairs.7090 CONTINUED: 90EMILYWell-thank you all for coming.WOMAN MOURNERThank you for doing this, Emily.THE MOURNERSYes, thank you, Emily.EMILYAs you all know, Monica was not a religious
          woman. Anybody who ever had to sit through
          a wedding or a funeral with her knows how
          she felt about formal occasions. So Harry
          and Elise and I, when we were talking about
          this, decided we would just have everyone
          over and let.anyone who wanted to.talk.
          about Monica just talk about her. Maybe
          share some remembrances of her. Some of us
          know each other, some of us don't. But
          we're all here because we loved Monica.
          (She stops. Gets a hold of herself) And 
          because we want to pay tribute to her in a
          way that might conceivably not enrage her.
          Everyone laughs slightly.EMILY (CONT'D)I don't want to tell anyone what to think,
          or how to feel. And I don't want to kid
          myself about the stupid, meaningless way
          she died, because it would really make her
          throw up. But I don't want it to become the
          summation of her life. Because it's not.
          When her Lisa died I said to her, "How can
          you stand it?" And she said. "First of all
          I can't. But I don't want to take away the
          twelve years she did have, and turn them
          all into leukemia. Because they weren't."
          So despite the fact that she got -- ripped
          off, I do think it's important to remember
          that Monica got a lot out of life. She was
          the most fully developed person I
          personally have ever known. She was also
          impossible to get along with, but that's
          another story.
          Everybody laughs.EMILY (CONT'D)As most of you know, she had more than her
          share of trouble over the years. But that
          never diminished her compassion or stopped
          her from embracing life to the absolute
          fullest -- measure.7190 CONTINUED: (2) 902ND MOURNERShe sure did.EMILYSo. Now I've said my little piece. And now
          I want to talk a little bit about the first
          time we met. She was twenty one.
           Emily stops so as not to cry. There is a long, charged silence.WOMAN MOURNERIt's OK, Emily.EMILYI know...! (She waits) And I was nineteen! 
           Even though it's impossible for my children 
           to believe I.was ever that young.

          cousins in Arizona. You talked to Abigail.
          She's the one who gave you my number...LISAYeah...EMILYWell, she's a living nightmare. They never 
          got along at all.WOMAN MOURNERExcuse me. Good bye, Emily. Thank you so
          much for doing this.
          Emily and the Woman Mourner hug each other goodbye.7291 CONTINUED: 91EMILYListen. I still can't believe this is
          happening...! (she starts crying) I mean 
          what the fuck is wrong with her?WOMAN MOURNERI don't know!EMILYI don't understand why she didn't kill 
           herself when Lisa died! And then Barry, and 
          then after all that with her mother, and 
          then her father, she gets hit by a fucking
          bus? It's like a joke! But that's Monica.
          Always the worst luck. Always. (noticing
          LISA) OK, sweetheart. Thank you for coming.

          time of the accident. She was right-there
          when she died, and she wanted to come to
          the funeral. I told her there was no
           funeral, but she wanted to come anyway. I 
           wouldn't have done that at her age, would

          is saying about human suffering here?LISAI don't know. Sorry.JOHNYou know what, Lisa? That's not good
          enough. That's not good enough.
          Shakespeare wrote something: What's your
          response? And don't tell me you don't have
          one because I don't buy it.LISAI don't really have a lot to say. It seems

          Matthew?MATTHEWI think it is self-evident. I think he's

          Thank you, Matthew. Yeah, I agree. Only
          it's not Shakespeare saying it: It's
          Gloucester. Maybe another character would
          have a different point of view.JOHNOK: That's a valid point. Just because
          Shakespeare has one of his characters say
          it doesn't mean he personally agrees with
          it. Yes: David?DAVIDYeah, maybe Shakespeare isn't saying the
          gods don't care about us. Maybe he's saying
          there's a higher consciousness that we
          can't see. That the gods' perception of
          reality is so much more developed than ours
          that compared to their perception, our
          perceptions are like comparing flies toBOYSJOHNOK...I don't think that's what he's getting
          at...I think what he's getting at here is a
          very dark view of the arbitrary nature of
          human suffering.DAVIDBut maybe he's not. Maybe he's comparing
          human consciousness to divine
          consciousness, and he's saying that even
          though it seems to us that human suffering
          is just arbitrary, that's just because
          we're limited by our viewpoint.JOHNWell -- let's look at the text. Let's test
          David's hypothesis. "We are to the gods as
          flies to wanton boys. They kill us for
          their sport." I have to agree with Matthew,
          that seems pretty unambiguous.DAVIDYeah, because he's saying there's a higher
          purpose that we can't see. He's saying that
          what seems like them killing us for sport
          could just be because our consciousness
          isn't developed enough to see what the
          higher wisdom of their killing us is.

          he's trying to say. Um...DAVIDNo, like if you say they kill us for their
          sport, when our perception of the gods is
          so meager that we can't even tell what
          they're doing, then how can we be so
          arrogant as to think that they would bother
          to kill us for their sport?JOHN(LOST)I don't know ...Um -- Monica?MONICAI don't think that's what he's saying at
          all. I think he's saying the gods don't
          give a shit about human beings and they
          just kill and torture us for fun --MATTHEWYes. Much like flies to wanton boys.
          Anybody? Anybody?MONICAYeah...1DAVIDBut if the gods' consciousness is so much
          more developed than ours that we seem like
          flies to them, then how can we be sure what
          they have in mind for us or why they do
          anything?JOHNDavid, I think you've made your point.
          But it's not what Shakespeare meant.
          Scholarly opinion is pretty consistent that
          he's trying to say something about
          human suffering here --DAVIDScholarly opinion...:JOHNAnd in this particular play what I think
          he's trying to say is pretty black --

          comparing human consciousness to flies, and
          he's saying that we can't see the truth
          around us because our consciousness is
          undeveloped.JOHNNo David, that's not what Shakespeare
          meant! He says it somewhere else in the

          .Yeah, because the Central Park
          Conservatory or whatever it's called put up
          about five hundred miles worth of these 
          cheap shitty-looking fences all over the

          The bus driver?DAVEWell, no, because the bus driver wouldn't
          have any money. You basically sue everybody

          carpeted living room, on the sofa, looking at pictures.RAMONThat's a little place we used to go on
          holiday, two hours outside of
          Cartagena...My family is all there still,
          but Rodrigo is studying in London, and
          Hector is in Geneva.JOANUh huh...RAMONI'm sure they will go back eventually,
          because they like to do something for their 
          country. But it's a worry, because it's 
          very bad there now.JOANYeah...I haven't really been following it.RAMONIt's a big, big mess. Last year I helped to
          found an organization to work with children
          whose families have been killed, or the
          parents have been kidnapped, so they don't
          know if they are alive or dead. We try to
          find homes for them, preferably in
          Colombia, because if we lose our young
          people, that's it: That's the future. We
          have raised a lot of money, but there's
          only so much we can do. You don't like to
          say it's hopeless, but it's hard to see the
          solution.JOANYeah. God...I wish I knew more about
          it...Do you mind if I ask you something?RAMONOf course not.JOANWhy are you interested in me?

          drum away.
          Lionel stops drumming on his desk with his fingers.KIRSTENI think that teenagers should definitely
          rule the world, because teenagers aren't
          corrupted by adult life yet, and they're
          idealists and they care. And I know a lot
          of people feel that teenagers are really
          naive, which they are, many of them. But
          they still haven't had a chance to get
          burned out by the disappointments and the
          harsh realities of learning how to play the
          game. So yes, I would vote yes.KLEINAll right: Lisa?LISAI would tend to agree with all of that,
          except I do think that teenagers don't
          always necessarily think things through
          very carefully, and they don't have enough
          experience to know what the right thing to
          do is all the time. I also think they tend
          to adhere to ideologies really easily
          without having actually bothered to think
          them through for themselves.--LEWISSuch as what?LISASuch as what? Such as, gee, I don't know:

          That's what I think!
          Emily tries to unhook her purse from the back of her chair.JOANThat seems excessive, Emily, come on --RAMONThat's the response. That's the Jewish
          response.EMILYIt's the what?RAMONIt's the Jewish response. You don't like
          what I am saying or what I do, so you --EMILYThat's my Jewish response.

          really cares about things.JOANShe's rude, Lisa. Ramon was my guest, not
          hers. And-so.was she, as a matter of fact --LISASo what? Why is it so JOAN
          important that people be No -- I'm not ar -- I'm
          polite all the time? Why not arguing about this with
          is that the big priority? you! I'm not interested in
          an exchange of ideas. As it
          happens Ramon said a few
          things I wasn't too crazy
          about either, so I guess
          that's the end of that...LISAOh is that supposed to be Emily's fault
          too?JOANI don't want to talk to you right now.
          Please go away.149 INT. RAMON'S OFFICE. DAY. 149Ramon is on the phone in his big midtown corner office.RAMON(on the phone)

           meant was, that was the typical response
           you will get from someone who will take
           that position that that woman was taking. 
           But if you like to break up with me because 
           I used the wrong adjective, what I'm going 
          to do? I'm not going to beg you.150 INT. COHEN KITCHEN/KARL'S HOUSE. DAY. 150Joan enters slowly and checks the water on the stove. Lisa
          is eating a carrot and reading a magazine. Silence.143150 CONTINUED: 150LISAWell...? How's that anti-Semitic piece of
          shit Ramon?-JOANOh God, I don't know.
          The PHONE RINGS. Lisa picks up.LISAHello?KARL(ON PHONE)Yeah. It's Dad.151 INT. KARL'S HOUSE. DAY.- 151WE CUT BETWEEN THEM.LISAHi, Dad, how are you? I'm really looking
          forward to our horseback riding trip...KARLYeah. That's why I'm calling. I don't think
          it's going to happen.LISAReally? What's the matter?KARLNothing's the matter. Nobody seems to
          really want to go, and I don't really feel
          like spending three thousand bucks on
          something nobody has the slightest interest
          in. So I think it's obviously better for
          everyone if we just cancel.LISAI never said I didn't want to go.KARLWell, I can't seem to get a straight answer
          about what anybody wants to eat, um,
          Annette is giving me a hard time about her
          schedule, I talk to Curtis and all I get
          are monosyllables, so --LISAI think-he's really looking forward to it --KARLUh huh? Well, you know, that hasn't really 
          been my impression. So, uh...I also think 
          it would be good to shelve the idea of your
          coming out here next year.(MORE)144151 CONTINUED: 151KARL (CONT'D)It looks like things are gonna start
          picking up for me in the Fall, which means
          I'm probably not gonna be around the house
          all that much, and since you and Annette
          detest each other, I don't, uh, I don't
          think that's what I want to come home to
          after a fourteen hour day.LISAWe don't detest each otherKARLOK, well, it doesn't really strike me as
          something you're that serious about anyway,
          so what do you say we just table it for the
          time being?LISAOK.KARLOK. So tell Curtis, uh, that New Mexico's
          off...Ummm, and I will talk to you, ummm,
          whenever.LISAOK...KARLYeah.
          He hangs up. LISA hangs up too.JOANWhat's wrong?LISADad's cancelling the trip.JOANWhat? Why?LISAHe's says nobody wants to go and he doesn't
          want to spend the money.JOANDid you say you didn't want to go?LISANo, I know there was some problem with
          Annette about arranging for food because I
          don't eat dead animals, but.I didn't think
          it was.going to wreck the whole trip.JOANOh boy.145151 CONTINUED: (2) 151LISAI thought you said it sounded like it was 
          going to be a disaster. Personally I'm
          relieved. I'm not moving out there, either,
          by the way, obviously. Which is fine too.152 INT. KARL'S HOUSE. DAY. 152Karl sits holding the phone in a savage depression.153 INT. MR AARON'S APARTMENT. DAY. 153Lisa sits on a sofa. She takes a sip of coffee.LISAThank you for letting me come up. I don't
          know who else to talk to.
          She's talking to MR AARON, who looks very uncomfortable.MR AARONThat's all right...LISAYou've always been very sympathetic to my
          craziness, and I may not show it all the
          time, but I actually really appreciate it.MR AARONIt's no problem, Lisa. What's been going
          on?LISAI just need to talk to somebody who doesn't
          completely misunderstand who Iam. Or not
          even who I am, but what's going on inside
          me, or all around me. Sound confused
          enough? Anyway, for whatever reason, I
          always felt like we understood each other
          on some level, even though I'm like a mass
          of conflicting impulses and you're
          basically the most grown-up, rational man I
          know.MR AARONWell...I doubt that's actually true
          but thank you...LISAYou seem pretty fuckin' rational to me.
          Like that seems to be your leading feature.
          I mean you obviously have a lot of pretty
          deep feelings...So when you're rational -
          just to finish my thought -- it's like this
          really interesting way of governing
          yourself.(MORE)146153 CONTINUED: 153LISA (CONT'D)And you don't have to get all uncomfortable
          again: I'm not talking about what you think
          I'm talking about, because I know that
          subject is-off-limits. I'm talking about
          your soul, I guess, and how you feel you
          have to keep it in check all the time by
          being sensible. Do you know what I'm saying
          at all?MR AARONWell...We all have feelings, Lisa. I happen
          to believe that who you are comes out of
          how you deal with those feelings. Somebody
          makes you mad, you don't just pick up a gun
          and shoot them...Or if you do, that says
          something about who you are, and how you've
          been raised...LISAWell, I don't want to disillusion you, but
          we happen to be living in a world where
          that is what people do. More often than
          not.MR AARONThat's not true, Lisa. I think it's very
          sad that you see it that way. There's
          eight billion people alive in the world and
          you think they don't all want to kill
          someone once in a while? But they don't.
          Most of them. Or they see some person they
          -- (Pause) I think most people do try to be 
          civilized by some standard. Even if it's a
          standard you and I might not agree with...LISANo, I get it. That's actually the most
          hopeful thing anybody's said to me for a
          long time. I don't know why I take such a
          dire view of things, I really don't.
          She removes her jacket. She's wearing a small clingy T-shirt.LISA (CONT'D)Just a little hot...A little warm .Is
          this all right?MR AARONSure.LISADo you allow smoking in your apartment?MR AARONYou can smoke.
          She gets her cigarettes out and lights one. He gets up and
          brings her an ashtray. They meet at the sofa and sit.147153 CONTINUED: (2) 153LISAI like your apartment.MR AARONThank you.
          She blows some smoke out and waves it away.LISASorry.MR AARONThat's all right.LISAThis is terrible.MR AARONWhat is? What's terrible?LISAI just like you so much...(Smooths her ash
          on the ashtray.) Sorry. What a moron.MR AARON(taking her hand)
          Hey. Lisa. I'm your friend. And that's not
          gonna change. That's not gonna change.LISAThanks. Thank you.
          She kisses his hand a couple of times.MR AARONLisa...LISAPlease just let me for a second. I like you
          so much. I like you so, so much.
          She kisses his hand more elaborately. He lets this go on.
           She lifts her head up and they kiss for real. After a moment
          she slides her hand onto his leg.MR AARONOK, look...LISADon't stop me yet, OK?
          They kiss some more. She bends down to unzip his fly.MR AARONPlease don't do that.148153 CONTINUED: (3) 153LISAJust let me for one second...
          She bends her head over his lap. He lets her.154 INT. MR AARON'S APARTMENT. LATER. 154CLOSE on their faces as they are have having sex on the sofa.
           She freezes up and starts freaking out.MR AARONAre you all right?LISANothing. It's OK.- MR AARONMaybe we should stop.LISADon't stop. It's OK.MR AARONAre you all right?LISAYes, yes, you don't have to keep asking me 
          that.MR AARONI think we should stop.LISANo, keep going...!
          She keeps pushing against him.155 INT. MR AARON'S APARTMENT. LATER. 155AT THE DOOR. She is leaving. He is burning with guilt and
          shame. Silence. Then:LISAAll I can say is I better get a pretty
          fuckin' good grade in geometry this year.
          (Pause) Lighten up! I'm kidding.MR AARONSorry. I really didn't expect anything like
          this to happen. I'm really not sure how to
          react.LISADon't worry. I'm not gonna tell anybody if
          that's what you're worried about. I totally

          They're totally disconnected. And if they
          have any time for each other at all, it's
          either like a biological imperative or like
          some weird cultural anomaly. That's what I
          make of it.JOANWell...I think it's pretty unfortunate that
          you think that. Because I feel like you and
          I used to relate to each other really well.LISAI'm not trying to hurt your feelings.
          It's just a general observation.JOANOK...Hey, could I get a hug?LISASure.
          Lisa rises and hugs Joan. It's not a good hug.JOANI just feel totally at sea.

          And then my Mom'11 have you arrested, and
          then spend the rest of her life feeling bad
          about it. So why don't we just skip the
          whole thing and forget about it?MR AARONI'm not sure I know how to do that.LISAYou'll learn.163 INT. LISA'S BATHROOM. NIGHT. 163Lisa looks at a pregnancy test stick.

          what to do? (half- baby. What do you want to do?
          laughing) Baby... .?JOANYes! Now who is the father?LISAIt could be a lot of people.
          Joan looks at her. Lisa haltingly holds her ground. Joan
          takes a sympathetic step toward her. Lisa shrinks back. Joan
          stops. Her expression hardens.JOANWho.158165 CONTINUED: 165LISAI'm never gonna tell you, Mom! It's against

          tell me about these boys?166 INT. GYNECOLOGIST WAITING ROOM/HALL/RECOVERY ROOM. 166Joan waits. She looks around the small room. There are two
          couples and two lone women. A NURSE appears.NURSEMrs. Cohen?

          Joan goes into the recovery room. Lisa is on the table in a
          crumpled paper robe, looking like a small crumpled piece of
          paper herself. Joan sits down.LISAHi.JOANHi honey.LISAI'm sorry, Mom.JOANLet's talk about it later.167 INT. DEUTSCH'S OFFICE. DAY.Deutsch sits with Emily and Lisa. The Berwitzes are on the
          speaker phone.DEUTSCHI'm very pleased to be able to inform you
          all that I had a long meeting with the
          lawyer for the bus company, and they've
          agreed to settle out of court for three
          hundred and fifty thousand dollars.ABIGAIL & ROBWhat! Fantastic! That's wonderful!159167 CONTINUED: 167DEUTSCHI'm assuming this is agreeable toEVERYBODY --ABIGAIL ROBYes, fantastic That is fantastic!DEUTSCH (CONT'D)But I gotta -- obviously I gotta bring

          what Russel has to say, and then talk about

          offer.(MORE)160167 CONTINUED: (2) 167DEUTSCH (CONT'D)I think they're very anxious to settle, but
          I also do think that at this moment they're
          under the maximum amount of pressure we can
          really bring to bear, and I don't believe
          they're gonna come up any higher --ABIGAILHey. Three hundred and fifty thousand 
          dollars...ROBOK, now let me just --ABIGAIL.that's nothin' to sneeze at.ROB ABIGAILI just want to introduce Now, 1 think -- Can

          gained from holding out for more.DEUTSCHI think it would be a big mistake.ABIGAILRobbie, what do you think?ROBSold!ABIGAILSold!161167 CONTINUED: (3) 167DEUTSCHOK. Now the only down side to this as it
          stands -- and the reason I asked Emily and
          Lisa to be here is because I know this may

          the bus company will absolutely not discuss
          the removal of the driver.LISA & EMILYWhat?LISAWhat do you mean?ROBThe driver?LISA EMILYThen forget it. Tell them to What do you mean they
          forget it. won't discuss the removal

          I pressed them very very hard on this, but
          they will not discuss disciplining of a
          company employee as part of the settlement
          because it could be seen as an admission of
          guilt on the part of the MTA --LISAWhat does giving us three hundred thousand
          dollars mean?DEUTSCHSettling out of court does not imply an
          admission of guilt. It simply does not
          carry the same stigma. On top of that you
          may not know, Lisa, they're involved in a
          very tricky labor dispute at the MTA rightNOW:162167 CONTINUED: (4) 167LISAYeah, we know all about that! Just tell
          them to forget it.'DEUTSCHI know that's your reaction...LISAIt's the only reason we're here.ROBCan I jump in here?

Please!LISAIt's Emily's decision.EMILYNo.DEUTSCHNo.ROBHello?LISAIt's not?ABIGAILThey're not listening, Robbie.DEUTSCHIt's Abigail's decision because she's the
          next of kin.LISABut she didn't even know about it!EMILYThat doesn't matter.ABIGAILCould we get back in this conversation
          please?DEUTSCHYes. I'm sorry. Obviously there's some very
          strong emotions going either way on this --163167 CONTINUED: (5) 167ABIGAILListen, Emily? I don't know what you're
          thinking, but Rob and I are thinking we
          should take Russel's recommendation while
          we can. Because if they won't fire the
          guy, they're not gonna fire him. And six
          months or a year from now we're gonna --ROBExactly.ABIGAILwe're gonna be in a situation where
          we're beggin' them for half this much,
          which is gonna hurt 'em half as much as
          now, and they're still not gonna fire this
          guy! Or maybe he'll have already quit and
          the whole thing will be moot by then.. Do
          you see what I mean?LISAThe entire point of the lawsuit was to get
          the guy fired so he doesn't kill somebody
          else -- !DEUTSCHLemme just clarify --LISA-- it was not to get you three hundred and
          fifty thousand dollars you didn't know you
          were entitled to, for somebody you didn't
          even like... !ABIGAILThis is a distortion --LISAAnd the only reason you're getting the
          money at all is because I started this
          whole fucking thing in motion! I'm sorry
          for swearing, but you should be willing to
          trade in all the money for getting this guy
          off the street --EMILYFor getting him, Abigail!ABIGAILWell I'm sorry, but I have a responsibility
          to Monica and I take that responsibility
          very seriously. You are talking about an
          offer that is gonna be withdrawn if we
          don't do something about it right now.(MORE)164167 CONTINUED: (6) 167ABIGAIL (CONT'D)And rather than being abused over the
          telephone and cursed at for having the
          courtesy to involve you in these
          discussions, Lisa, I would hope you would
          be guided by our judgement. Unless I'm
          wrong about that.LISANone of that matters --ABIGAILUnless I'm wrong about that. Just what is
          your interest in this?LISABecause I'm the one who killed her! I'm
          the one who killed her! But at least I
          know I did it, and that guy has no idea!
          And he's wandering around blaming everybody
          else and all I want is for somebody to let
          him know that what he did was wrong! And
          if they don't fire him and all you want is
          the money and the police won't do anything,
          how is he gonna know he's wrong? You can't
          take the deal, Abigail! It wasn't so you
          could get any money, it was because we
          wanted to get him fired! It doesn't matter
          about the money! You wouldn't have gotten
          it before!ABIGAILWell it may not matter to you, but where I
          come from three hundred and fifty thousand
          dollars is an awful lot of money, and to my
          mind is a positive result of all this
          tragedy and not just negative. Not just
          getting someone fired for one mistake, no
          matter how bad it was --LISAOh SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS!
          She knocks the speaker phone off the desk and runs to the
          door in floods of tears.DEUTSCH & EMILYLisa!LISAYou sleazy fucking lawyer! And you're a
          moralistic cunt!
          She runs out.165168 EXT. STREET. DAY. 168TRACKING in front of Lisa as she walk-runs down the busy
          street. A city bus appears behind her and goes by. She cranes
          to see the driver. It's not her guy. She keeps going.169 EXT. SCHOOL. DAY. 169Lisa stands against a car, smoking, as the kids flow out of
          the building. Mr Aaron comes out, talking with BONNIE, the
          gymnastics teacher. They walk away from the school together.
          Lisa catches up with them.BONNIEHey, Lisa. What's Up?- LISAHey, did you guys know I had an abortion
          last week?
          Pause.MR AARONNo. I didn't know that.LISAYeah, it cost four hundred dollars.BONNIEUm, should I...MR AARONNo, no, don't go anywhere.LISAYeah, don't go anywhere.
          Bonnie doesn't know what to make of this. Mr Aaron looks
          steadily at Lisa.MR AARONDo you want to tell us about it?LISAYeah. I do.MR AARONOK. -Go ahead.LISAWell...
          She doesn't speak. Pause.BONNIEDo your parents know about this, Lisa?166169 CONTINUED: 169LISAYes.BONNIEHave you told the father, honey?LISANo...There's a couple of people it could
          be.MR AARONI think you better tell them. Whoever they
          are.LISANo...No...Never mind ...I'm sure he's sorry
          anyway, whichever one he is.MR AARONI don't see what difference that makes, if
          he's sorry. And I think whoever it is
          should know about this.LISAI'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought this
          up. Please don't tell anyone.BONNIEWe're not gonna tell anyone. But you're
          gonna have to tell whoever it could be --LISA(On have to")
          That's OK. I gotta go. Thanks for
          listening. It's -- It doesn't matter about
          the father, because the whole thing was my
          fault. I'm sorry...!
          She shakes her head and runs away.BONNIEWhat was that...?170 INT. COHEN APARTMENT. DAY. 170Lisa comes in. Curtis is doing his homework at the table.CURTISMom's looking for you.LISAWhat for?CURTISShe thinks you're going out with her
          tonight.167170 CONTINUED: 170LISAWhere are we going?CURTISI don't know.
          Lisa heads for her room. Joan appears, half-dressed.JOANLisa? Honey? Did you forget we're going to
          the opera?LISAYes.JOANI didn't-remind you because I didn't want
          to nag you.LISAIt's OK.171 EXT. BROADWAY -- NEAR LINCOLN CENTER. DUSK. 171Lisa starts to cross the street against the light. Joan takes
          her arm.JOANDon't get run over.
          A cab rattles by. Lisa looks down the street. A BUS is
          approaching.LISAWait. I want to see if that's him.JOANWhat.
          They wait. The bus gets closer, heading straight toward them
          and stops at the bus stop. Lisa grabs her mother's arm.LISAIt is him. Mom, that's the one...
          Joan and Lisa look at him. He's staring out ahead of him as
          people board the bus. He SEES Lisa and Joan but can't see
          their faces and doesn't recognize Lisa: He just sees two
          dolled-up women under the street light. He smiles dazzling at
          them and drives past with a short wave.
          Joan looks at Lisa. She looks like she's about to throw up.JOANCome on. We're gonna miss the curtain.168172 EXT. METROPOLITAN OPERA -- OUTDOOR TERRACE. NIGHT. 172Lisa is out on the terrace smoking a cigarette, looking out
          over Lincoln Center. Joan comes out and stands next to her,
          but Lisa won't look at her or interact.JOANWell, so far it's not the greatest opera I
          ever heard.LISAWhat do you mean? It's OK.
          The end-of-intermission chimes sound. People start going in.
          Joan turns and goes in too. Lisa keeps smoking.172A INT. METROPOLITAN OPERA - GRAND STAIRCASE. NIGHT 172ALisa comes down the stairs and goes into --173 INT. METROPOLITAN OPERA -- ORCHESTRA. NIGHT. 173Lisa hurries down the long aisle. The LIGHTS DIM. The 
           audience applauds the entering conductor. She picks her way 
           past the other patrons in the row, whispering "Excuse me" and
           takes her seat just as the MUSIC STARTS. Joan looks at her. 
           Lisa stares straight ahead. 

           The curtain rises. On stage, the two women start singing the 
          barcarole "Belle Nuit." It's very beautiful.
          Joan looks next to her at Lisa. Lisa is trying not to cry,
          but tears are dripping slowly down her face. She sniffs and
          wipes them away, but they keep coming.
          Joan looks at her again, but Lisa still won't look at her.
          Joan takes Lisa's hand and Lisa breaks down completely,
          clutching Joan's hand back, squeezing it hard. Joan starts
          crying too out of sympathy.

          As the duet goes on they sit side by side holding hands, Lisa
          crying and holding on and wiping her eyes with her free hand
          and Joan crying too, but not as hard, grateful finally that
          the spell has been broken.

          The duet ends and we CUT TO BLACK.THE END
