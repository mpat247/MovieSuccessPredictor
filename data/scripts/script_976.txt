          - William FaulknerINT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, BROOKLYN - MORNINGWalter Mitty (30s) sits at his small kitchen table, balancing
          his check book. We see his last several expense entries:

          the corner to cross the street. Walter is among them, dressed
          in a short-sleeve business shirt and tie and with a briefcase
          on hand. Nothing happens. Then Walter's head explodes.CREDITS BEGINUp toward the clouds, propelled skyward, were the contents
          (ideas and images) of Walter's head; they've begun to float
          toward the ground.INT. SKYSCRAPER, NYC - SAMESome office work is going on. Then past the window (outside)
          comes floating down, in slow motion, Juan Valdez the
          Colombian Coffee guy (his donkey's floating down way in the
          distance).
                         
          This happens outside other high-rise and professional
          building windows - a floating Bishop Desmond Tutu, the
          silver Monopoly piece Top Hat, Statler and Waldorf (the two
          elderly curmudgeons from The Muppet Show) and additional
          detritus from Walter's mind such as Manute Bol, The Beastie
          Boys, etc. CREDITS PLAY.2.INT. STARBUCKS, MIDTOWN NYC - MOMENTS LATERWalter sits at a Midtown Starbucks. He's got his laptop out
          and he's in the middle of a phone call.EHARMONY COUNSELORYou know, you didn't really provide
                    much detail about your occupation.
                    Most people put theirs on their
                    eHarmony page. You don't care to?WALTERIs that like a must? Can't I just
                    say like "I'm employed" or
                    something?EHARMONY COUNSELOR(like okay but that's not
                          a great idea)

                    interesting. To women. Um. Or men.EHARMONY COUNSELORWhat do you do?WALTERI'm a Practical Asset Manager. For
                    a corporation.EHARMONY COUNSELOR(sounds like he agrees

                    you're not working?WALTERMostly I guess I commute to work?
                    It's like an hour and--EHARMONY COUNSELOROkay. No worries. I'll submit this
                    information, then check back in the
                    afternoon for your possible
                    eHarmony matchups. That's exciting,
                    huh?WALTERIt is, Todd. Yeah. Hey, when can I
                    leave a "wink" for someone? To see
                    if they "wink" back, or..?3.Walter's looking at his laptop. On screen is the eHarmony
          dating page for CHERYL M. (34), pretty but she looks like the
          sort of pretty girl who takes the bus; text beside her photo
          reads "Leave a wink for Cheryl M. to indicate your
          interest..."EHARMONY COUNSELORI'll have your eHarmony profile all

          Part of the eHarmony client profile has a section Been There,
          Done That - where people list their accomplishments, travels,
          etc.WALTERI forgot what I put there?EHARMONY COUNSELOR...Nothing.WALTEROh, okay.EHARMONY COUNSELORWe should beef that up. If you can
                    think of anything to add that would

                         taking a personalINTEREST)No, I just had some stuff on my
                    mind. The past couple months.EHARMONY COUNSELOR....What kind of stuff?WALTER(still thinking this

          Some awkward moments pass as Walter's unsure about following
          through on heavy conversation with a stranger.WALTER...okay thanks for asking, I guess,
                    um, Todd was your name?EHARMONY COUNSELORTodd Mahar. I'll be your eHarmony

          They finish their call. Walter looks at the computer picture
          of Cheryl M., then out the window at actual Cheryl M. (CHERYL
          MELHOFF, 34) crossing the street just outside the window for
          the Time-Life building lobby. Then as Walter stands to go,
          outside the Starbucks window, a grand piano (exploded from
          Walter's head) falls from the sky onto the middle of the 53rd
          street.EXT. 6TH AVE, NYC - LATERWalter's out on 6th among a crowd waiting for a light to
          cross. Then a black and white New Orleans Jazz Funeral
          procession passes in front of him - black and white in the
          sense everyone in it and all their instruments and lively
          waving umbrellas are in black and white. Walter and the
          business people around them are in color. CREDITS END. The

                    photographers.
                         
          Ted just looks at him for a moment.TED HENDRICKSI'm sorry. I was really getting
                    into this song. What were you
                    saying?

          The doors close. Ted's not coming by Gary's office.INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUSWalter walks up a long hallway toward his department floor;
          on the walls are hugely blown up Life Magazine photographs.
          Twelve foot high Muhammad Ali, Morgan Freeman (Oscar pose),
          Moon Landings. - Walter looks small compared. The last photo
          he passes is familiar - a black and white of a New Orleans
          Jazz Funeral.INT. WALTER'S DIVISION FLOOR, LIFE - LATERThe division Walter works in has fifty employees seated
          around an open floor plan - fifty cubicles in view. Walter's
          arrived at his to find on his desk a wrapped gift with a noteREADING:9.Heard rumbling's Life's over. Wanted to give you something
          cool if this is the last photo batch. Hope when you open it
          and look inside you'll think it's pretty special.
                         
          Walter's unwrapped the gift.
                         
          It's a leather wallet. Its front is embossed with the
          inscription from S.O. to Walter Mitty - thanks for the great
          work.
                         
          Walter looks back at the letter; it finishes - by the way,
          neg 12 is my best ever. Landmark. The Absolute Quintessence
          of Life. .... the rest of the batch kind of sucks. SeanINT. RECEIVING ROOM, LIFE MAGAZINE - LATERWalter has been working through a Life photo order negative
          box - it's marked Sean O'Connell. There's a co-worker
          (HERNANDO) cleaning up in the distance. Walter has been
          examining a negative roll with his loupes (magnifiers worn as
          eye glasses). THEN HE NOTICES SOMETHING THAT STOPS HIM. The
          negative roll, where the 12th negative should be, has been
          cut; 12 is missing.WALTERHey, Hernando-HERNANDOYeah?WALTERThis 12th neg? From this last Life
                    roll?HERNANDOYeah.WALTERIt's not here.HERNANDOWhat's it of?WALTERIt's of something that's the
                    Absolute Quintessence of Life. Or
                    something.HERNANDOWhat's "quintessence?"WALTERIt means like the best ever.10.A moment goes by.HERNANDOAnd you can't find it?WALTERUm no.HERNANDOWow. That's not going to go over
                    well with the new asshole.
                         
          The storage room is separated from the greater division floor
          by a wide glass window wall. At that moment, Walter has
          noticed new supervisor Ted Hendricks on the other side of the
          glass. He's holding a conversation with a LIFE EDITOR there.
          Walter can hear it (muffled).TED HENDRICKSHow's the issue shaping up?EDITORWe got an email from Sean
                    O'Connell.TED HENDRICKSThe photographer?EDITORYes. He said he got the cover shot.

          This has Walter concerned.11.INT. LIFE MAGAZINE CAFETERIA - LATERThe cafeteria is a large white room, with massive black and
          white Life photographs serving essentially as wallpaper.
          Particularly, they are images of physical and human immensity
          (photographs of the summitting of K2 and the beachheads of
          Normandy) and make the office workers here (Life magazine's
          low-level corporate workers among whom Walter is one) seem
          tiny in terms of their personal accomplishments but also
          physically. Walter and a co-worker TIM NAUGHTON sit in front
          of the Massive K2 mountain summit photograph.WALTERTim, did you find out anything
                    about Negative Box 2-6? Where it
                    was sent from?TIM NAUGHTON(like he's a real bigDEAL)That's the Sean O'Connell
                    commission?WALTERYeah, the guy who took this--
                         
          Walter gestures to the K2. It's taken from above a guy who
          just summitted.TIM NAUGHTONThere's nothing in shipping. The
                    box just showed up it seems like.
                    There's no receipt.WALTER...I'm getting nervous with these
                    new guys around. Lost negative. But
                    I'm not going to freak out. I think
                    my work here the last nine years
                    speaks for itself. I've made my
                    mark.
                         
          Then new superior Ted Hendricks walks past, accompanied by
          Life's EXECUTIVE ADMINISTRATORS.TED HENDRICKSWho am I evaluating next?EXECUTIVE(holding an employee file

                    mustache. He's a woman.
                         
          They've walked past Walter and out of the cafeteria - but
          Walter's heard every word - not promising.EXT. TIME-LIFE BUILDING, 6TH AVE, NY - LATERWalter sits at the cement bench on 6th just out front of the
          Time-Life building. He's looking at a photograph he's taken
          from his briefcase. It's a bad print - the kind someone takes
          before their camera's set - over exposed, out of focus - it's
          impossible to discern the subject.WALTER(WONDERING)What is this?
                         
          Cheryl Mellhoff sits down beside Walter.WALTER (CONT'D)What is this?
                         
          He hands her the foggy print - it's clear they have an
          established working friendship.WALTER (CONT'D)I think it's either a man with one
                    sideburn. Or a candelabra. Or a
                    Happy Days lunch box.13.CHERYL(can't make it out clearlyEITHER)It's... is it two badminton
                    racquets? What's it supposed to be?WALTERIt's the Quintessence of Life. So I
                    don't think it's two badminton
                    racquets. Sean O'Connell took this
                    just before he took another one we
                    lost.CHERYL(like that's significant)
                    You lost a Sean O'Connell?WALTER(looking at the out ofFOCUS PRINT)...I'm trying to figure out what
                    this picture is. I think he
                    focused, set his lens then took the
                    missing picture. It's just a better
                    picture of this. What is this?CHERYLMaybe Sean has it.WALTERThe negative? Yeah, I tried to
                    reach him. He's always in Bahrain.
                    Or a shanty town or somewhere - I
                    got one email off.
                         
          Walter shows Cheryl an email exchange from Sean O'Connell -
                         
          It reads - in need of info for neg 12 of neg roll three, box2-6.Sean's reply - Best picture I've taken. The total F'ing
          Quintessence of Life. I hope you're as happy with it as I am.
                         
          Walter's reply = Cool, but can't find it.
                         
          Sean's reply - Out of Office. This is an auto reply. Sean
          O'Connell will be out of the office through the month of

          The helicopter begins to ascend (the environment around the
          pub is pretty, different than what we've seen). We also
          haven't seen Walter sprinting before, which he is now
          (briefcase), arriving, then leaping three feet up into the
          passenger seat of the helicopter.INT. HELICOPTER, FLYING - LATERWalter's high above Greenland, flying over a fjord. It's
          breathtaking. He yells to be heard from the passenger seat to
          the pilot.WALTERIs that a fjord?PILOTYeah.WALTERI've seen pictures of fjords. But
                    I've never actually seen a fjord. I
                    don't think I've ever even said the
                    word fjord out loud--PILOTStop saying fjord. It's annoying.WALTEROkay.EXT. VIEW DOWN ON ATLANTIC - LATERThis is a look from way up at an international shipping
          vessel mid-sea. The weather around it's getting rocky. On
          deck, they're prepping a life raft.INT. HELICOPTER, GREENLAND, SKY, MOVING - LATERWalter's getting rocked a little in the helicopter passenger
          seat. The weather's getting rough. They're in some low lying
          storm clouds.PILOT(yelling over the blades)
                    We're not going to be able to land
                    on the freighter. I've got to drop
                    the radio parts and you in a life
                    raft.(MORE)40.PILOT (CONT'D)It's a short drop, but your
                    decision. You can just fly back
                    with me.WALTER(yelling over the blades)
                    I'd really like to get my hands on
                    this property. They're making some
                    changes at the office. It's going
                    to reflect poorly on my work. I
                    might get let go. And I have a
                    mounting piano situation that's--

                    Whoa...
                         
          The pilot carries on to the freighter. Walter seems to be
          calling on his reserves to see this through.INT. HELICOPTER - LATERIt's noisy. The weather's rough. There is lots of lifting and
          dropping. Walter's steadying himself in the cargo hold,
          preparing to jump..PILOTYou're doing great. We're only six
                    feet up. Just jump out the door,
                    Walter.EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - SAMEThis is wide view of what's going on. We see the back of the
          hovering helicopter. To its left is the international
          shipping vessel the Dolores which has placed a life raft
          between it and the helicopter. There is still some space to
          the right of the frame where there's open water. That's the
          side of the helicopter Walter mistakenly jumped from. After
          he surfaces, he starts to drift away from the freighter.EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - LATERWalter's treading water a fair distance from the freighter.
          The crew (Chilean) has gathered at the bow of the freighter.
          The captain calls out to Walter through a megaphone.CAPTAINWe're sending a pontoon. Try to
                    remain calm.
                         
          At this point a fin passes behind Walter.CAPTAIN (CONT'D)(through the megaphone)
                    Okay, if that's a porpoise--41.WALTER(sort of to himself,LOOKING AROUND)If what's a--
                        (noticing the fin)
                    what?CAPTAINIf that is a porpoise, befriend it.
                    Porpoises are mammals with rare
                    intelligence and sympathy. They
                    often protect swimmers from
                    predators.
                         
          The fin circles by again.CAPTAIN (CONT'D)If that's a shark, strike it. Their
                    snouts are sensory hubs.WALTER(CALLING OUT)How do you-- I just see a fin. Can
                    you get a bead on some more
                    information?
                         
          On board the crew has a brief consultation.CAPTAIN(then, to Walter throughTHE MEGAPHONE)We're confident that's a shark.
                         
          The fin comes nearer. Walter steels himself. Then he finds
          some presence of mind and power and is able to deter the
          thing away by thrashing at it with a few decent punches.CAPTAIN (CONT'D)(after a moment)
                    Okay, now we think that was a
                    porpoise.
                         
          After another moments, another fin shows up.CAPTAIN (CONT'D)That probably is a shark.
                         
          At this point, though, the pontoon arrives and Walter
          scrambles into it (he still has his briefcase).42.INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - LATERWalter has dried off. He's being tended to by some young
          Chilean sailors. He's been sounding them out about where Sean
          O'Connell is.CHILEAN SAILORSean O'Connell? He was picked up.WALTERFrom your ship?CHILEAN CAPTAINA pilot boat came. They took him.

          It's dawned on Walter that he's missed Sean. Just by a
          little.WALTERCan we radio them? There's
                    something I need to discuss with--CAPTAINYou jumped into the ocean with our
                    radio components. No. We are, as
                    you say, "on our own."EXT. INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING FREIGHTER THE DOLORES - LATERThe freighter's hauling automobiles. The surface of the ship
          looks like a mall parking lot. One of the Chilean sailors
          accompanies Walter on a walk among the car rows.CHILEAN SAILORYou can sleep where Sean did.
                         
          They stop alongside a Subaru. The Sailor opens the driver's
          door. He means this is where Sean slept. In this Subaru.
          Walter's confused.WALTERSean slept here?CHILEAN SAILORYes.43.WALTERIn this Subaru Outback?CHILEAN SAILORYes. That's where our undocumented
                       laborers sleep. Our Stevedores.

                       This was his room/car?CHILEAN SAILORNow it will be your room/car.INT. SUBARU OUTBACK - SAMEWalter has gotten in. There are five Chilean Stevedores in
          the back in different states of rest - sleeping, reading,
          playing chess.WALTERHey. Walter.
                         
          They wave.WALTER (CONT'D)Did you guys, were you living in
                       this car back seat when Sean

                    Spanish form? Yeah. Sean says that.
                         
          A deck Squall Alarm sounds. These guys leave the car quickly
          (to perhaps batten something down). Walter notices the
          breaktime snack they were enjoying - half's been left behind.WALTER (CONT'D)Is that Clementine cake? My mom
                    makes-- I didn't know anyone else
                    made that.
                         
          Walter's alone in the Subaru.WALTER (CONT'D)Clementine cake. Wow.
                         
          He reaches for some cake, it's been sliced into pieces,
          wrapped bakery style in some stray paper from the backseat.
          Walter takes one such slice. While the storm lifts and lowers
          the ship, Walter enjoys some clementine cake, then he notices
          something about the paper scrap it's wrapped in. There's
          handwriting on it. Walter examines it.
                         
          What Walter's holding is a half-torn page bearing cursive
          handwriting. There is a date beside the word:

          scrawl beside it.WALTER (CONT'D)(EXCITED)...this is an itinerary.CUT TO:A CLOSE UP OF THE WORD EYJAFJALLAJ�KULLEXT. SHIP CROW'S NEST - LATERDuring this storm, Walter has climbed up the crow's nest
          ladder and stands in the crow's nest with the English-
          Speaking Chilean Sailor who escorted him to the Subaru.
          Walter's showing him the paper - Eyjafjallaj�kull45.WALTERThat's where Sean is. Tomorrow.

          Now we see Walter; he's a short distance away in the seating
          area, but he's not seated because he's a human cubicle. He's
          shaped like a cubicle.WALTER AS A CUBICLE(gesturing with the ArabicSKATEBOARD)Hey, I picked this up for you,

                    to lift it.
                         
          Walter has walked out to show Rich how to ollie. Walter does
          it pretty well.WALTER (CONT'D)You really just have to think about

                    Do you have any idea where Sean is
                    now?WALTERNo, I lost him. He said I had it
                    though. Like he knew. He smiled. He
                    said "you have it." "You." What's
                    he talking about?
                         
          At this point, Rich wipes out. He's scared. He slid on the
          pavement pretty far and he's shaken up. He bumped his
          shoulder pretty hard, and he's privately started to cry.CHERYLHoney. Hey. Come here. That was
                    great.

                    feel fine in five minutes. Don't

          She wraps him up. She starts rubbing his back. Then she
          starts singing.78.CHERYL (CONT'D)Don't worry, about a thing, `cause

          Walter's sitting right there with them. He knew she knew this
          song, and that she used it with Rich. He doesn't know why he
          knew it, but he did. They just sit there for a while, while
          Rich calms down. The song's pretty much worked, Walter's
          enjoyed being there as much as Rich.CHERYL (CONT'D)(quietly, to Walter)

          Some time passes. Then Walter puts on his loupes (eye glasses

          he's been so thrown by being fired in this manner that he's
          forgotten to take his head-mounted loupes off. It's an
          unusual image.
                         
          This is a view through Walter's loupes as he walks through
          Brooklyn trying to get his head together. The middle images
          are magnified but the outside circumference isn't - it's
          unusual and sort of pretty - to see people pass by, sometimes
          enhanced, then not, all a little dizzy, like Walter's
          feeling.INT. ELEVATOR, WALTER'S BUILDING - LATERWalter rides up the elevator with some normal-looking
          residents in his head-mounted loupes.INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATERWalter walks into his apartment. He sits down in the small
          living room (he's still wearing the loupes). Some time
          passes. Nothing seems to happen. Then, slowly, after
          considerable time, a look of powerful and complete
          astonishment comes over him. He's looking at something that
          has just shifted his world.
                         
          We see things from Walter's perspective (through the loupes).
          Most everything is out of focus because he's wearing them.
          But he's looking, in real life (in his apartment), at exactly
          the out of focus image that he has been carrying around a
          photo of. The object is in his apartment. He looks at this
          out of focus (because of the loupes) real object. Then he
          looks at the photo he still holds. They are indisputably the
          same. Then he looks back at the real object and removes his
          loupes to bring it into focus. It's the piano.

                    was, when you left, when you came
                    home. He said you really understood
                    Life. He wanted to know about your
                    work. He said you "got Life."

                    your piano?EDNAI was concerned we couldn't keep
                    it, Dear. I know it's a burden. I
                    didn't know if we could manage. So
                    I thought I might not see it again.
                    I wanted a picture.

          dream jobs. There's a large female jockey. A black matador,
          an elderly magician, etc. A wider view reveals a block full

          rodeo clown, Supreme Court Judge, a city-block full of who

          scrum, Walter becomes separated from his briefcase.  He's
          literally held it throughout the movie - Greenland, Dubai,

          The song kicks in. It's an electric area now. The song's
          powerful. The crowd's starting to feel like a mob. Walter's
          still a beach ball they're sending up to the stage. He
          crosses seventy feet on his back, passed up by a couple

          and join them. He does it.
                         
          There's no way that this crowd stays inside the concert
          grounds, and its energy level won't keep things safe. Soon
          enough the sparks of a riot start when some folding chairs
          start flying from the crowd over to the police, now flying
          cups of ice and water. Then there's face to face, cop-
          protestor taunting. There are five thousand young people in
          the street (and Walter) and they're too close to the sedans
          that drove the business leaders there. When a folding chair
          hits a lady cop it's a riot.
                         
          Down in the middle of it, Walter's got some mixed-feelings -
          some fear, but the mayhem's releasing something pent up that
          makes him feel good. He's thrashing around as hard as

          music, sun, collective anger. Someone throws a chair through
          a Starbucks window. Walter gets involved in some property
          destruction, all caught up in this big feeling. He tries to
          kick over a post office drop box, but it's welded in there,
          so he can't. Then he gets arrested.WALTER (CONT'D)Shit....

                    something?INT. HALLWAY - LATERMark and Walter sit Indian Style facing each other in the
          Four Seasons fifth floor hallway. Chatham's holding a
          negative roll.WALTERThere was one absent from the roll.
                    But I have it.

          Walter still doesn't say anything about his participation in

                    month and trying to get someone at

                    Someone else told me that. An hour
                    ago. Hey, I don't want to take up
                    too much more of your time. But I'd
                    like my severance. There's no cause
                    to keep it from me. That's what I
                    was trying to tell you downtown. I
                    did my job well for nine years.MARK CHATHAMThat's all you were trying to say
                    downtown?WALTERYeah.
                         
          Some moments go by next, while Mark and Walter sit Indian

          them.MARK CHATHAMI'm going to run some numbers.
                         
          Mark has stood up and started in to his hotel room. Walter's
          been following him.MARK CHATHAM (CONT'D)(meaning don't follow meIN)Not right now. I don't even know
                    where the numbers are. There in
                    some guy's computer. Show up
                    Monday, let's see.
                         
          The door closes, Walter's left out there to wait.117.EXT. SUBWAY STATION, BROOKLYN - NIGHTWalter has returned to Brooklyn; he's heading up a set of
          Subway stairs up to a neighborhood street.INT. TIME-LIFE BUILDING, NYC - DAYWalter crosses the huge lobby, dressed as always for work.INT. ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATERWalter has entered the elevator. He's alone. It won't work
          without his floor elevator key (which stopped working once he
          was let go). Walter waits a moment. Then he tries his key.
          The button illuminates. Walter starts to ascend.INT. WALTER'S DIVISION FLOOR, CORRIDOR - LATERWalter has reached the floor elevator corridor door to his
          division floor office. He's just tried his pass key. That
          functions as well.INT. ACCOUNTING OFFICE - LATERWalter waits in a line at an accounting office window counter
          (like a DMV) behind recently let-go colleagues Tim Naughton
          and Gary Mannheim. Tim speaks to the accounting clerk.TIM NAUGHTONTim Naughton? Severance package?
                         
          She hands Tim his check. He's sad, but he takes it and heads
          off.GARY MANNHEIMGary Mannheim. Same.
                         
          After a moment, Gary gets his severance. He's also blue about
          it. Then Walter steps up.WALTERWalter Mitty? Is there a...
                    possibly there's a severance
                    package for me?
                         
          She starts typing into her keyboard.WALTER (CONT'D)I was fired for cause, but then I
                    think I maybe gave them cause to
                    provide me with a severance
                    package.118.ACCOUNTING CLERKIt's not really a package. It's
                    just one check. For forty two
                    hundred dollars. That's what
                    everybody's getting.WALTEROkay. Possibly there's that? For
                    me?
                         
          She's typed additional stuff. Then she roots around in a
          check stash. Then she hands Walter an envelope. He takes it.
          He looks at it for a while. For the first time in a long
          while, he seems relieved.EXT. CENTRAL PARK, NYC - LATERWalter's just walking through the park. He looks at peace.
          There are many others around, all coming and going at a
          normal pace, but the earth around them transforms from winter
          to summer smoothly over the course of thirty seconds as they
          naturally inhabit the park in their regular ways. So when
          Walter sits at a bench. It's all midsummer around him. He's
          smiling from relief.CUT TO:A FLOATING PIANOThis is a grand piano mid-air in Manhattan.EXT. BATTERY PARK - LATERThere's a winch machine, a huge rig, lifting this piano to
          the 7th floor of the residential building Walter secured for
          his mom. Walter and Odessa stand in Battery Park, looking up
          at the piano. The movers are setting it into the removed
          window space. It looks like it's going to fit.INT. VILLA, ROOM, RETIREMENT - LATERThe piano has fit easily here. Odessa and Edna are
          straightening up, putting the last few things away. The
          room's in good shape. It's really pretty nice. Edna seems at
          home.ODESSA(TO WALTER)Hey, babe, come on. We'll go grab
                    lunch.
                         
          Odessa and Edna head out the door.119.WALTERI'll be right out.
                         
          They go. The room is quiet. Walter looks around again. Making
          it happen took considerable effort no one but Walter will
          know about. After a moment, he goes and sits at the piano.
          Some time passes. Then Walter plays the beginning of Cheers.
          Then he gets up and follows his sister and mom out.EXT. 5TH AVENUE - LATERWalter's walking with Odessa and Edna. They've come past a
          newsstand with magazine displays. Walter was going to walk
          right on by like Edna and Odessa did. But he's noticed
          something on the magazine racks that's stopped him. He stands
          there for a while looking at it.
                         
          It's the last issue of Life Magazine. Its cover is a black
          and white photograph of Walter siting on a cement bench out
          front of the Time-Life building. He's got his lunch in a
          brown bag beside him; he's looking over photo prints with his
          loupe, working carefully on some day in the past to fulfill
          the wishes of Life's photographers- a person who's work the
          world never knew took place. It's really good. You can see
          the word LIFE on the building sign above the bench. So the
          last photograph, on the last cover of Life, elegantly honors
          the people who quietly worked there and cared for it.
                         
          Walter stands in front of the newsstand looking at it. It's
          the first time he's seeing it. It's a message that to Sean,
          at least, and possibly to others his work was meaningful.EXT. BATTERY PARK, NYC - DAYOn another day, Walter's sitting in Battery Park across the
          little street where his mom lives. He's with Cheryl. Her son
          Rich skateboards around the park.CHERYLHow'd the move go?WALTERAll done.CHERYLEverybody's good?WALTEREverybody's good.
                         
          Time passes.120.WALTER (CONT'D)How's Life?CHERYLThe company or the... thing.WALTERBoth.CHERYLThe company's okay. The thing's
                    tough.WALTERYeah.CHERYLAre you glad you're not there
                    anymore?WALTERI'm excited. About the new stuff.CHERYLWhat's the new stuff?WALTERI don't know yet. Would you have
                    lunch with me? Somewhere not in the
                    cafeteria. For once. Out somewhere?
                    In the world. I was wondering that.
                         
          She smiles at Walter.CHERYLYeah...
                         
          She starts looking in her scheduler.CHERYL (CONT'D)The ninth? Is that good? Two days?WALTERThe ninth. Yeah.CHERYLYeah, cool.
                         
          Walter seems pleased. Rich skates by and does a move. Cheryl
          and Walter sit there a while. They can hear piano music.CHERYL (CONT'D)Is that your mom?121.WALTERYeah.CHERYLShe's good.WALTERYeah.
                         
          Some time goes by. Walter looks tired, worn out from his
          extended journey and his large efforts to keep the lid on the
          critical matters of his life. But he also looks relieved and
          satisfied. Piano music continues. The title appears again:
          The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. Then CREDITS BEGIN.
