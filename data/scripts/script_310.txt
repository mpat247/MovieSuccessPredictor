                         of that spinning wheel of 
                         misfortune.

               A MAN'S hand spins the wheel. The ball is thrown against 
               the spin. Hands, faces, chips...JACK'S VOICEThe world turned round him... 
                         leaving him miraculously untouched 
                         The little white ball circles the 
                         spinning wheel.

               The PUNTERS'S faces as the ball starts to bounce. All eyes 
               are on the bouncing ball.JACK'S VOICEThe croupier had reached his goal.

               offices. He ls casually but fashionably dressed, hair dyed 
               blond long, a nervous elegance about him, almost 
               unrecognisable from the croupier's face.

               He searches for the right office. He finds it. The name on

               Beneath the iron barred window, with a view of the iron 
               steps down from the street, JACK sits at the dining table. 
               In front of him is a word processor. He toys with a glass 
               of vodka, smoking a Gitane, and leafing through a soccer 
               fan magazine. He starts to touch-type, looking at the 
               screen, not the keyboard. Words appear, letter by letter...

                         looking for a dealer, a croupier.

               looks at what he's written: 'THE BALL... A NOVEL BY...JACK MANFRED.'JACK'S VOICEJack knew something was wrong. 
                         He'd forgotten Giles' advice. Giles 
                         said three words.

               JACK inserts a word in the title. It now reads: 'ON THE

               appearance, devoid of mystery or glamour. The place has 
               roulette tables and blackjack counters. It is deserted 
               except for several CLEANING LADIES, vacuuming, emptying 
               ashtrays. REYNOLDS walks with JACK, talking.REYNOLDSThere are three types of casino in

                         business. The punters like company.

               REYNOLDS goes to one of the tables with JACK.REYNOLDSLet's see you handle the chips.

               He slides open a box and tips 200 chips of varying 
               denominations onto the table.JACKI have to assume the serial numbers 
                         on the bowl and cylinder correspond.REYNOLDSWe check every four days.JACKWhy four? And not three or five?REYNOLDS(shrugs)
                         It's the procedure here. Now sort 
                         the chips.

               JACK starts to stack the chips in piles from a hundred 
               pounds to five. REYNOLDS watches. JACK'S fingers work fast. 
               In a matter of moments he has the lot stacked.JACKStacks of 20. Rows of 5.REYNOLDSAny exceptions?JACK25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.REYNOLDSGive me 365.

               He presses a stopwatch in his hand. JACK quickly sets out 
               four neat piles, three of 100, one of 65. All four piles 
               are in denominations of ten and five.REYNOLDSVery good. Now take these colours...

               He throws a pile of blue and white chips on the table.  
               The blue are 10, the white are 5.REYNOLDSI want 780, but I want 500 in 
                         denominations of 25.

               JACK nods and gets to work. His fingers make Reynolds's 
               ticking watch seem slow.REYNOLDS(impressed)

               for fifteen punters. It's a set-up to test Jack's style 
               and concentration. REYNOLDS gives JACK the white ball.JACKYou use two alternating, don't 
                         you?REYNOLDSWe do.

               JACK spins the wheel, throws the ball against the turn.JACKNo more bets.

               As the ball begins to bounce, but before it stops, REYNOLDS 
               turns to a CLEANING LADY who's emptying some ashtrays 
               nearby.REYNOLDSCould you stop that for a minute?

               The WOMAN looks up, surprised. JACK watches, then catches

               third line.JACKI'm sorry, sir, I've called no 
                         more bets.

               JACK reaches across, takes the chip and puts it on the 
               wood Grounding the wheel. REYNOLDS nods approvingly. The

                         like this, it depends on the 
                         condition.JACK'S VOICEThe car was a gift from Jack's 
                         father. That's to say, Jack Senior 
                         had given it to him before the 
                         bailiffs arrived.

               The DEALER looks at JACK. JACK stares back. It's as if one

               in a crowded moving train. He looks at the faces, MEN and 
               WOMEN. He sees PEOPLE reading books. He looks at the TITLES: 
               Romantic fiction, Classics, Business Management, Thrillers, 
               Self-Help, Cooking....JACK'S VOICEJack imagined people reading his 
                         book. One day he would enter their 
                         heads, play with their imaginations,

               Victorian houses have been converted into flats. There are 
               scores of 'For Sale' and 'To Let' signs down the street.JACK'S VOICEHe would tell them you have to

               version of 'Try a Little Tenderness'. JACK comes in, hangs 
               his hat up, looks around. He sees a neatly arranged vase 
               of flowers that wasn't there before. He goes to the bedroom.INT. BEDROOM - NIGHTJACK sees on the bed, an open box and a carrier bag from a 
               designer department store. Among the white tissue paper is 
               a simple black silk dress and lace-decorated black 
               underwear. He smiles and picks up the knickers. He goes to 
               the open bathroom door, from which comes the music.INT. BATHROOM - NIGHTA radio plays beside the bath. The water is draining away.

               MARION NEIL, a red-haired woman in her mid-thirties, wearing 
               a bathrobe with the name MARION on it is examining the 
               lines on her neck in the half-steamed bathroom mirror. She 
               sees JACK, turns with a smile. JACK holds up the black 
               knickers.MARIONI couldn't resist them.JACKYou mean I won't resist them.

               JACK goes to her.MARIONNo, no. I'm not ready for you.

               bed.INT. KITCHEN - NIGHTJACK takes the vodka bottle out of the freezer, pours 
               himself a glass. He sees two bottles of wine opened, food 
               neatly prepared, ready to cook, an open cook book. He pours 
               a glass of wine.INT. SITTING ROOM - NIGHTJACK sits drinking his vodka. Looking up through the barred 
               window he sees women's legs passing on the street above. 
               On the desk beside the computer is the glass of wine.

               MARION materialises in the door to the bedroom. She is 
               made up, wearing the black dress and high-heeled black 
               shoes, a black scarf around her neck.

               JACK takes the glass of wine and gives it to her.JACKYou really are a beautiful woman.MARION(pleased)

               MARION whirls to show off her dress.JACKYou're all I desire.

               He reaches for an envelope on the desk. He gives it to 
               her. MARION opens it. There are several fifty pound notes 
               inside.MARIONWhere did you get it?JACKI. sold the car.MARIONYou shouldn't have done that. I

               seductively towards the bedroom door.MARIONCome into my world.

               JACK takes the pack of cards, splits it expertly into two,

                         it. If after one month no one had 
                         approached him, he calculated the
