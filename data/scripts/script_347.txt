    powerful SPEEDBOAT -- her hair tossed back by the wind, her
    mouth in a euphoric grin.FADE OUT.2   CREDITS -- ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE                                       2MATT (V.O.)My missionary ancestors came to the
               islands and told the Hawaiians to put
               on clothes, work hard, believe in
               Christ, and stop surfing and hula
               dancing. They made business deals
               along the way -- buying an island, or
               marrying a princess and inheriting her
               land. Now their descendants wear
               bikinis and running shorts, play beach
               volleyball and surf, and take up hula
               dancing. Hawai'i has always been a
               place of contradiction.3   EXT. HONOLULU - DAY                                               3VARIOUS SHOTS of Honolulu begin a pattern of montages to be
    interspersed throughout the film.MATT (V.O.)My friends on the mainland think just
               because I live in Hawai'i, I live in
               paradise. Like a permanent vacation --
               we're all just out here drinking mai-
               tais, shaking our hips, and catching
               waves. Are they nuts? How can they
               possibly think our families are less
               screwed up, our heart attacks and
               cancers less fatal, our grief less
               devastating? Hell, I haven't been on a
               surfboard in fifteen years.4   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY                                          4We ZOOM BACK from a panorama of Honolulu to find 50-year-old

    has brought his work with him.(CONTINUED)2.The Descendants       PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft4   CONTINUED:                                                          4MATT (V.O.)For the last 23 days, I've been living
                 in a "paradise" of IVs and urine bags
                 and endotracheal tubes and six-month-
                 old US magazines. Paradise. Paradise
                 can go fuck itself.

    Matt looks up at the WOMAN we saw in the speedboat, now lying
    stiffly on an upright HOSPITAL BED, her head cocked to one
    side, a feeding tube in her nose, a ventilator in her
    trachea, IVs in her arm.MATT (V.O.) (CONT'D)This is Elizabeth King, my wife.
                 Twenty-three days ago she was launched
                 from a powerboat during a race and hit
                 her head, almost drowned. Now she's in
                 a coma that scores 5 on the Glasgow
                 scale and 3 on the Rancho Los Amigos
                 scale, scores showing an extremely
                 severe coma. Liz is very competitive.
                 Whatever she does, she does to the
                 fullest.5   INT. NEUROLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY                                     5Matt is getting the current DIAGNOSIS.NEUROLOGISTShe reacts non-purposefully to stimuli
                 in a non-specific manner, but
                 occasionally her responses are
                 specific, though inconsistent. Her
                 reflexes are primitive and often the
                 same, regardless of stimuli
                 presented...MATT (V.O.)It was exactly what Elizabeth used to
                 accuse me of.6   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY                                            6Matt continues to observe her.MATT (V.O.)Twenty-three days in a coma, and any
                 day now the doctors will give me their
                 final verdict if she's going to come
                 out of it or not. Then I have a
                 decision to make. Wait, that's wrong.

                 decisions. But I know she's going to
                 pull through.

    counselor MRS. THULL.MS. HAYASHIWe just don't think these photographs
                 are appropriate for Scottie to be
                 sharing with her classmates. Some of
                 them went home quite disturbed, and we
                 got some angry calls from parents.MATTYeah, she's sort of been going to town
                 with the whole picture-taking thing,
                 but I had no idea --MS. HAYASHII can't tell you how my heart goes out
                 to you and your family, but Scottie
                 just hasn't been herself. Principal
                 Cruz agrees with us that it maybe would
                 be better for Scottie to remain at home
                 with you during this difficult time.MATTHome. See, I would think that sticking
                 to her normal routine would be the best
                 thing for her -- you know, keep her

                 And her sister's away at school on the
                 Big Island. I don't think Scottie
                 would really want to hang out with me
                 when she could be with her friends and
                 people like you who specialize in
                 children.MRS. THULLMr. King, we see this every day --
                 children acting out at school when
                 something's wrong at home. And your
                 family is facing a devastating crisis.
                 Have you been engaging Scottie in
                 really talking about what's going on?
                 Encouraging her to express her
                 feelings? That's crucial.MATT(No)

    Matt stares aghast at this specimen called his daughter. The
    ladies glance between Scottie and Matt, wondering when, or
    whether, he'll intervene. Finally --MS. HAYASHIScottie, that is not a good choice!

               those pictures of Mom for your art
               project?SCOTTIEI'm a photographer, Dad, a real
               photographer.MATTNo, you're not. You're overdoing it is
               what you're doing.SCOTTIEI saw it in a book. Some famous
               photographer lady took pictures of her
               mom in the hospital while she was
               dying, and they're considered art.
               That's what I'm doing.MATTFirst of all, your mother's very sick,
               but she's not dying. Second, you don't
               share personal stuff like that with
               strangers. What's going on with Mom is
               private.SCOTTIEI'm hungry. Can we get burgers?MATTNo.SCOTTIECan we get smoothies?MATTNo.

    As Scottie continues --MATT (V.O.) (CONT'D)The last time I took care of Scottie by
               myself was when she was one. Now she's
               ten, and I have no idea what goes on
               inside her head. She's insane. And
               with Elizabeth in the hospital, I think
               she's testing me. I'm the backup

               rather than taking her picture all the
               time, you should talk to her. I'm
               tired of asking you. You heard Dr.
               Johnston -- people in a coma can hear
               you -- you know, well, some of them
               can. It lets them know they're still
               loved, might even help them wake up
               sooner. And it'll help you express
               whatever feelings and emotions you're

     HOME OFFICE and into the DINING ROOM.MATTHow can I help you?BARB HIGGINS (O.S.)Let's see, where to start? It's
                  Scottie. She's been texting some awful
                  things to Lani, and I'd like her to
                  stop.MATTFor instance.BARB HIGGINS (O.S.)Here's the latest one. "We all know
                  you grew pubes over the summer." She
                  sends little messages like that for no
                  reason. She even wrote it on Lani's
                  Facebook wall.MATTHuh.BARB HIGGINS (O.S.)She calls my daughter Lanikai, implying
                  she's like the size of an entire

                  nice?MATTThat's not like her at all.       She's
                  usually very sweet.

                  manager, Edward King, whose parents
                  were missionaries. Between his land
                  deals and her huge inheritance, all of
                  their descendants for generations have
                  watched the past unfurl millions into
                  our laps through leases and sales. Now

     When he opens the door and pulls back the curtain, he finds --30   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                     30-- friends MARK AND KAI MITCHELL up for a visit. They're
     playing MUSIC for Elizabeth on a mini-boombox, and Kai is
     APPLYING MAKE-UP to Liz's face.

     After cheery greetings --MATTWhat're you doing?KAIOh, she's been looking a little pale
                  lately all cooped up in here, and I
                  just know she'd be mortified if no one
                  had thought to help her out with some
                  lipstick and blush. I know she'll
                  grill me.

                  ready to nuke.

     Matt smiles -- he'd been expecting a grim moment alone with
     Elizabeth, but instead he finds a room full of warmth and
     life. Even if it's a little creepy.MARKSo what's the latest anyway, Matt?    Any
                  updates?MATTNo, no. Just more of the same --

               what I was saying was, when I was

               moved, so I was pretty encouraged. I
               thought that was an encouraging sign.

               whole attitude toward me, Matt -- I
               mean, I feel terrible. I wish it were

                   funny creature with its eight legs.
                   But did you know octopi are actually
                   extremely intelligent, like dogs and
                   cats? They have unique personalities,
                   and just like us they have a lot of
                   defense mechanisms. I'm sure you know
                   about the ink sac. She uses ink to
                   confuse her predators. She can
                   camouflage herself. She can emit
                   poison, and some can mimic more
                   dangerous creatures, like the eel. I
                   keep her to remind me of our defense
                   mechanisms -- our ink, our camouflage,
                   our poison, all the things we use to
                   keep away hurt. The reason Dr.

                   girl right now, and you're surrounded
                   by people who love you. I came to meet

                   to talk about what you're feeling, I

                   work for an octopus but not for us.(CONTINUED)99.The Descendants        PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft114   CONTINUED: (2)                                                   114DR. JOHNSTONOkay.    Thank you, Dr. Herman.

      Dr. Herman looks at everyone with great sincerity before

                anymore.DR. JOHNSTONNot exactly, but... yes, that's the
                general idea. So we're doing exactly
                what she wanted us to do if that ever

      glancing up at Matt.                                                     *MATT (CONT'D)                                     *Scottie, you're next. Go ahead, it's                        *

      Alex passes the box and scooper to Scottie.                              *SCOTTIE                                           *What should I say?                                          *ALEXANDRA                                         *Just say goodbye.                                           *

      Scottie looks at Alex and scoops out a pile, holds them at               *
      eye-level, and pauses.                                                   *MATT                                              *Come on, Scottie.

      Now Matt takes his turn. He looks directly inside the urn at               *
      the ashes that were once his wife.                                         *ANGLE ON THE ASHES -- HIS POV                                              *A complex series of emotions passes over his face -- love,                 *

      Without further ceremony he upends the BOX over the water and              *
      pours the rest of Elizabeth into the ocean.                                *

      All three take a long look as the mass of ashes disappears.                *
