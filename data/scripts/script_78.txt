Based on the novel by Bret Easton Ellis 

Fourth Draft 
November 1998INT. PASTELS RESTAURANT- NIGHTAn insanely expensive restaurant on the Upper East Side. 
The decor is a mixture of chi-chi and rustic, with swagged 
silk curtains, handwritten menus and pale pink tablecloths 
decorated with arrangements of moss, twigs and hideous 
exotic flowers. The clientele is young, wealthy and 
confident, dressed in the height of late-eighties style: 
pouffy Lacroix dresses, slinky Ala�a, Armani power suits.

CLOSE-UP on a WAITER reading out the specials.WAITERWith goat cheese profiteroles and I also have an arugula 
Caesar salad. For entr�es tonight I have a swordfish 
meatloaf with onion marmalade, a rare-roasted partridge 
breast in raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale...

Huge white porcelain plates descend on very pale pink linen 
table cloths. Each of the entrees is a rectangle about four 
inches square and look exactly alike.

CLOSE-UP on various diners as we hear fragments of 
conversation. "Is that Charlie Sheen over there?" "Excuse 
me? I ordered cactus pear sorbet."WAITERAnd grilled free-range rabbit with herbed French fries. Our 
pasta tonight is a squid ravioli in a lemon grass broth...

CLOSE-UP on porcelain plates containing elaborate 
perpendicular desserts descending on another table.

PATRICK BATEMAN, TIMOTHY PRICE, CRAIG MCDERMOTT and DAVID 
VAN PATTEN are at a table set for four. They are all wearing 
expensively cut suits and suspenders and have slicked-back 
hair. Van Patten wears horn-rimmed glasses. 

The camera moves in on Bateman as his narration begins:BATEMAN (V.O.)We're sitting in Pastels, this nouvelle Northern California 
place on the Upper East Side.

The Waiter sets down plates containing tiny, elaborately 
decorated starters. As he does so we hear Bateman's 
description of each of the men at the table.BATEMAN (V.O.)You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in 
a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences 
between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van 
Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the 
best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a 
bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten 
keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .VAN PATTENWhat are the rules for a sweater vest?

McDERMOTT 
What do you mean?PRICEYes. Clarify.

McDERMOTT 
Well, is it strictly informal-BATEMANOr can it be worn with a suit?

McDERMOTT 
(Smiling) 
ExactlyBATEMANWith discreet pinstripes you should wear a subdued blue or 
charcoal gray vest. A plaid suit would cal I for a bolder 
vest.

McDERMOTT 
But avoid matching the vest's pattern with your socks or
tie. Wearing argyle socks with an argyle vest will look 
too studied.VAN PATTENYou think so?PRICEYou'll look like you consciously worked for the look.VAN PATTENGood point. Excuse me, gentlemen.

Van Patten leaves the table. As he does so, a busboy 
discreetly removes their largely untouched plates.BATEMANVan Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?PRICEIt looks that way, doesn't it?

McDERMOTT 
(Staring at retreating waiter) 
Did he just take our plates away?PRICEHe took them away because the portions are so small he 
probably thought we were finished. God, I hate this place. 
This is a chicks' restaurant. Why aren't we at Dorsia?

McDERMOTT 
Because Bateman won't give the maitre d' head.
(He guffaws)

Bateman throws a swizzle stick at him.

McDermott scans the room, settling on a handsome young man
with slicked-back hair and horn-rimmed glasses.

McDERMOTT 
Is that Reed Robinson over there?PRICEAre you freebasing or what? That's not Robinson.

McDERMOTT 
Who is it then?PRICEThat's Paul Owen.BATEMANThat's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the
room. Over there.

He points to another handsome young man with slicked-back 
hair and horn-rimmed glasses.

McDERMOTT 
Who is he with?PRICE(Distracted by the waitress's 
cleavage as she bends over to 
uncork a bottle of wine � the 
waitress glares at him) 
Some weasel from Kicker Peabody.

Van Patten returns.VAN PATTENThey don't have a good bathroom to do coke in.

McDERMOTT 
Are you sure that's Paul Owen over there?PRICEYes. McDufus, I am.

McDERMOTT 
He's handling the Fisher account.PRICELucky bastard.

McDERMOTT 
Lucky Jew bastard.BATEMANOh Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with 
anything?

McDERMOTT 
Listen. I've seen the bastard sitting in his office on the
phone with CEOs, spinning a fucking menorah. The 
bastard brought a Hanukkah bush into the office last December.BATEMANYou spin a dreidel, McDermott, not a menorah. 
You spin a dreidel.

McDERMOTT 
Oh my God. Bateman, do you want me to fry you up
some fucking potato pancakes? Some latkes?BATEMANNo. Just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks.

McDERMOTT 
Oh I forgot. Bateman's dating someone from theACLU.Price leans over and pats Bateman on the back.PRICEThe voice of reason. The boy next door. And speaking 
of reasonable...

He shows McDermott the bill for the meal.

McDERMOTT 
Only $470.VAN PATTEN(Without irony) 
Not bad.

The others murmur agreement. Four platinum Amex cards slap
down on the table.INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHTBateman is pouring vintage champagne into flutes. Price is 
lighting up a cigar.

McDERMOTT 
Last week I picked up this Vassar chick-VAN PATTENOh God, I was there. I don't need to hear this 
story again.

McDERMOTT 
But I never told you what happened afterwards. So 
okay, I pick up this Vassar chick at Tunnel-hot number, big 
tits, great legs, this chick was a little hardbody-and so I 
buy her a couple of champagne kirs and she's in the city on 
spring break and she's practically blowing me in the 
Chandelier Room and so I take her back to my place-BATEMANWhoa, wait. May I ask where Pamela is during all 
this?

McDERMOTT 
Oh fuck you. I want a blowjob, Bate-man. I want a chick 
who's gonna let me-VAN PATTEN(Putting his hands over his ears) 
I don't want to hear this. He's going to say something 
disgusting.

McDERMOTT 
You prude. Listen, we're not gonna invest in a co-op 
together or jet down to Saint Bart's. I just want some 
chick whose face I can sit on for thirty, forty minutes.

Price throws a cigar at McDermott, who catches it.

McDERMOTT 
Anyway, so we're back at my place and listen to 
this. She's had enough champagne by now to get a fucking 
rhino tipsy, and get this-VAN PATTENShe let you fuck her without a condom?

McDERMOTT 
This is a Vassar girl. She's not from Queens. She 
would only-are you ready? 
(Dramatic pause) 
She would only give me a handjob, and get this...she kept 
her glove on.

The men sit in shocked, horrified silence.

ALL IN UNISON Never date a Vassar girl.EXT. TUNNEL NIGHTCLUB - NIGHTThe limo pulls up to the sidewalk outside the Tunnel. 
McDermott holds the door open for a passing HOMELESS MAN, 
who looks confused.

McDERMOTT 
I suppose he doesn't want the car. Price, ask 
him if he takes American Express.PRICE(Offering card) 
You take Amex, dude?

The man stumbles away. The club DOORMAN, seeing the limousine, 
unhooks the 
velvet rope and welcomes them inside.INT. LADIES ROOM, TUNNEL - NIGHTBrilliant white light, a bemused elderly female attendant in a 
black-and-white maid's uniform trying to give out paper towels. 
MUSIC thuds through an open doorway. Trashed-looking girls 
stare into mirrors repairing their eye make-up or sit on the 
counter chatting to friends. There are almost as many men as 
women in the room. Couples stand in line, twitching as they 
wait to do coke. As soon as one bathroom door opens, a couple 
lurches out rubbing their noses while another couple rushes 
past them and slams the door.PRICEThere's this theory out now that if you can catch the 
AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, 
then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular 
dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for 
Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-BATEMANI'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a 
virus.PRICEOh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.

Price and Bateman finally get a stall and rush in. Price is 
sweating.PRICEI'm shaking. You open it.

Bateman opens a tiny packet of coke.PRICEJeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?BATEMANMaybe it's just the light.PRICEIs he fucking selling it by the milligram? (He dips 
the corner of his Amex card in the packet and takes a snort) 
Oh my God...BATEMANWhat?PRICEIt's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!

Bateman dips his Amex in the envelope and snorts.BATEMANIt's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do 
enough of it we'll be okay.PRICEI want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it 
on my fucking All-Bran.

The GUY IN STALL next door yells at them in an effeminate 
voice:GUY IN STALLCould you keep it down, I'm trying to do drugs!

Price pounds his fist against the stall.PRICE(screaming)SHUT UP!BATEMANCalm down. Let's do it anywayPRICEI guess you're right...
(Raising his voice)THAT IS, IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT'S OKAY!GUY IN STALLFuck you!PRICE(Trying to climb up against the aluminum divider) 
No, FUCK YOU!! 
(He collapses, panting against the stall door) 
Sorry, dude. Steroids...Okay, let's do it.BATEMANThat's the spirit.

They both dig their platinum Amex cards into the envelope 
of white powder, shoveling it up their noses, then sticking 
their fingers in to catch the residue and rubbing it into 
their gums.INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHTBateman saunters toward the bar as "Pump Up the Volume" 
plays in the background.

BATEMAN (to BARGIRL) Two Stoli on the rocks.

He hands her two drink tickets.BARGIRLIt's after eleven. Those aren't good anymore. It's 
a cash bar. That'll be twenty-five dollars.

Bateman pulls out an expensive-looking wallet and hands her 
a $50.

She turns her back and searches the cash register for 
change.

BATEMAN You are a fucking ugly bitch I want to stab to 
death and then play around with your blood.

The music muffles his voice. She turns around. He is 
smiling at her. She gives him his change impassively.INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT- MORNINGTableaux of Bateman's apartment in the early morning light. 
A huge white living room with floor-to-ceiling windows 
looking out over Manhattan, decorated in expensive, minimalist 
high style: bleached oak floors, a huge white sofa, a large 
Baselitz painting (hung upside down) and much expensive 
electronic equipment. The room is impeccably neat, and oddly 
impersonal - as if it had sprung straight from the pages of 
a design magazine.BATEMAN (V.0.)My name is Patrick Bateman. I am 
twenty-six years old. I live in the American Garden 
Buildings on West Eighty-First Street, on the eleventh 
floor Tom Cruise lives in the penthouse.

Bateman walks into his bathroom, urinates while trying to 
see his reflection in a poster for Les Miserables above his 
toilet.BATEMAN(V.0.) I believe in taking care of myself, in a 
balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine. In the 
morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice 
pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand 
now.

Bateman ties a plastic ice pack around his face.

Bateman does his morning stretching exercises in the living 
room wearing the ice pack.CUT TO:A mirror-lined bathroom. Bateman is luxuriating in the 
shower steam, scrubbing his body, admiring his muscles.BATEMAN (V.O.)After I remove the icepack, I use a deep 
pore-cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a 
water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body 
scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub.

Bateman stands in front of a massive marble sink applying a 
gel facial masque.BATEMAN (V.O.)Then I apply an herb mint facial masque which 
I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my 
routine.

Bateman opens the door of a mirrored cabinet, which is 
stocked with immaculate rows of skin care products. He 
begins selecting bottles jars and brushes, laying them in 
readiness on the marble counter.BATEMAN (V.O.)I always use an after-shave lotion with little 
or no alcohol because alcohol dries your face out and makes 
you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye 
balm, followed by a final moisturizing "protective" lotion...

Bateman stares into the mirror. The masque has dried, 
giving his face a strange distorted look as if it has been 
wrapped in plastic. He begins slowly peeling the gel masque 
off his face.BATEMAN (V.O.)There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some 
kind of abstraction, hut there is no real me, only an 
entity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold 
gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping you 
and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably 
comparable: I simply am not there.INT. BATEMAN BEDROOM - MORNINGAnother huge white room, equally minimal: a futon, rumpled 
white sheets, a bedside lamp with a halogen bulb, and a large 
expensive painting (Eric Fischl or David Salle) chosen by 
Bateman's interior decorator.

Dressed in silk boxer shorts, Bateman stands in front of a 
huge walk-in closet, filled with rows of expensive shirts, 
shoes and designer suits, organized according to color and 
tone.BATEMAN (V.O.)It is hard for me to make sense on any given 
level. My self is fabricated, an aberration. My personality 
is sketchy and unformed, my heartlessness goes deep and is 
persistent.

Fully dressed in Armani, Bateman stands in front of a 
full-length mirror in the middle of his vast bedroom, 
adjusting his cuff-links.BATEMAN (V.0.)My conscience, my pity, my hopes disappeared 
a long time ago, if they ever did exist.

He gives a last look at the mirror and likes what he sees. 
He gives his reflection a smile.INT. OFFICES OF PIERCE & PIERCE - DAYAs Bateman walks down the corridor, he passes another MAN who 
looks just like him.MANMorning, Hamilton. Nice tan.

Bateman walks past the desk of JEAN, his secretary, pulling 
his Walkman from around his neck. Jean is attractive, 
wholesome, earnest. She smiles shyly. She loves him.JEANLate?BATEMANAerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?JEANRicky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what 
he was canceling or why.BATEMANI occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. 
Anyone else?JEANAnd...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.BATEMANWhen?JEANAfter six.BATEMANNegative. Cancel it.

Jean follows him into his office.JEANOh? And what should I say?BATEMANJust...say...no.JEANJust say no?

Jean stands at his desk, waiting for instructions.BATEMANOkay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols 
at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All 
right?JEAN(Playfully) 
Yes, sir.

She turns to leave.BATEMANOh wait. And I need reservations for two at Arcadia at eight 
tonight.

Jean turns around.JEANOh, something. . romantic?BATEMANNo, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.JEANI'll do it.BATEMANNo. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?JEANYou look nice today.

Jean exits. Bateman straightens some magazines in his 
office, lifts a painting off the wall and puts it back at a 
slightly different angle. He fiddles with some pencils in a 
beer stein. He puts on some MUSIC and flips through a 
Sports Illustrated. He buzzes Jean. She comes in a moment 
later with the Perrier and a file.JEANYes?BATEMANIs that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that 
outfit again.JEANUmmm...what? I didn't hear you.BATEMANI said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a 
dress. A skirt or something.

Jean stands there, then looks down at herself.JEAN(Smiling bravely) 
You don't like this, I take it?BATEMANCome on, you're prettier than that.JEAN(Sarcastically) 
Thanks, Patrick.

The phone RINGS and Jean turns to leave.BATEMANI'm not here. And high heels. I like high heels.

As Jean leaves, Bateman clicks on the TV set in one corner 
of the room and starts watching Jeopardy!INT. TAXI - EVENINGEVELYN WILLIAMS, Patrick Bateman's 
fianc�e, is making notes with a gold Cross pen and sipping 
a bottle of mineral water. Evelyn is blonde, classically 
beautiful, expensively educated, and utterly pleased with 
herself. She usually addresses Patrick as if he were a 
small child.EVELYNI'd want a zydeco band, Patrick. That's what I'd 
want, a zydeco band. Or mariachi. Or reggae. Something 
ethnic to shock Daddy Oh, I can't decide...And lots 
of chocolate truffles. Godiva. And oysters on the halfshell.

CLOSE-UP on Bateman, who is wearing a Walkman and staring 
out the window.BATEMAN (V.O.)I'm trying to listen to the new George 
Michael tape but Evelyn-my supposed fianc�e-keeps buzzing 
in my ear.

Evelyn continues to make notes.EVELYNMarzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. 
Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. 
And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.BATEMAN(Removing his Walkman) 
Do...what.EVELYNGet married. Have a wedding.BATEMANEvelyn?EVELYNYes, darling?BATEMANIs your Evian spiked?EVELYNWe should do it.BATEMANNo-I can't take the time off work.EVELYNYour father practically owns the company. You can do 
anything you like, silly.BATEMANI don't want to talk about it.EVELYNWell, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just 
quit? You don't have to work.BATEMANBecause I...want...to...fit...in.

The taxi bumps to a halt.INT. ESPACE RESTAURANT- NIGHTA cavernous garage, harshly spot-lit, decorated in 
self-conscious brutalist chic. Iron girders, walls of waxed 
plaster featuring exposed rusted pipes, a huge Schnabel 
smashed-plate painting on one wall. The tables and chairs are 
made of extremely uncomfortable 
bolted steel.BATEMAN (V.O.)I'm on the verge of tears by the time we arrive at Espace 
since I'm positive we won't have a decent table, but we do, 
and relief washes over me in an awesome wave.

Tm Price and two downtown types, STASH and VANDEN, are 
already seated. Vanden is about twenty, pretty and sullen, 
with green streaks in her black hair. Stash is pale, with 
ragged black hair and bad skin.

They are all trying to read large stainless steel menus 
that look like minimalist art.PRICEThe menu's in braille.

He gets up to greet them, giving Evelyn a suspiciously long 
kiss.PRICEI have to talk to you.

He drags her away, half giggling and protesting.EVELYN(Over her shoulder) 
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden 
and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.BATEMAN(After smiling at his own reflection in the mirror and 
checking his hair) 
Hi. Pat Bateman.

Vanden takes his hand reluctantly, says nothing.BATEMANLet me guess-you live in the East Village?

Pause.STASHSoHo.

COURTNEY RAWLINSON and LUIS CARRUTHERS arrive at the table. 
Courtney is blonde, classically beautiful and from 
precisely the same social background as Evelyn, but she is 
considerably more fragile and neurotic. Luis is 
half-English, half-Argentinean, slightly overweight (a 
rarity in this crowd), puppyish and eager to please. He 
wears the same type of designer clothes as Price and 
Bateman, but with foppish tendencies: velvet jackets, 
bow-ties, boldly patterned vests.

They exchange air kisses. As soon as Luis turns his back, 
Bateman sneaks a kiss on Courtney's neck.COURTNEY(Whispering) 
Stop it!

Stash and Vanden watch them in silence.LATER:Price is whispering in Evelyn's ear. Everyone else is 
quietly eating, except Bateman, who is drinking and watching 
Evelyn and Price.BATEMAN (V.O.)I am fairly sure that Timothy and Evelyn 
are having an affair. Timothy is the only interesting
person I know. Courtney is almost perfect looking. She s 
usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs. Tonight 
I believe it's Xanax. More disturbing than her drug use, 
though, is the fact that she's engaged to Luis Carruthers, 
the biggest dufus in the business.

Courtney rouses herself from her drug haze.COURTNEYTell me. Stash...do you think SoHo is 
becoming to...commercial?CARRUTHERSYes, I read that.PRICEOh, who gives a rat's ass?VANDENHey. That affects us.PRICE(Wired on coke) 
Oh ho ho. That affects us? What 
about the massacres in Sri Lanka, honey? Doesn't that 
affect us, too? I mean don't you know anything about Sri 
Lanka? About how the Sikhs are killing like tons of 
Israelis there? Doesn't that affect us?BATEMANOh come on. Price. There are a lot more important 
problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign 
policy is important, but there are more pressing problems 
at hand.PRICELike what?BATEMANWell, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow 
down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world 
hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We 
have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We 
have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and 
oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while 
also promoting equal rights for women but change the 
abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still 
somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.

The table stares at Bateman uncomfortably.BATEMANWe also have to control the influx of illegal 
immigrants. We have to encourage a return to traditional 
moral values and curb graphic sex and violence on TV, in 
movies, in pop music, everywhere. Most importantly we have 
to promote general social concern and less materialism in 
young people.

Price chokes on his drink. Everyone is silent and 
mystified.CARRUTHERSPatrick, how thought-provoking.INT. EVELYN'S BEDROOM - LATER THE SAME EVENINGBateman and Evelyn are lying on her bed watching television.BATEMANWhy don t you just go for Price?EVELYNOh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?BATEMANHe's rich.EVELYNEverybody's rich.BATEMANHe's good-looking.EVELYNEverybody's good-looking, Patrick.BATEMANHe has a great bodyEVELYNEverybody has a great body now.

Bateman unbuttons his shirt and makes advances to get 
Evelyn to have sex with him. She ignores him, watching the 
Home Shopping Channel with the remote in her hand. Finally, 
he straddles her, penis close to her face. She tries to 
look around him at the TV, then takes notice.EVELYNWhat do you want to do with that, floss with it?

Bateman flops back down beside her and stares at the television.EVELYNAre you using minoxidil?BATEMANNo. I'm not. Why should I ?EVELYNYour hairline looks like it's receding.BATEMANIt's not.EXT. STREET - LATER THAT NIGHTIt is 3 a.m. Bateman is standing at an ATM, listening to the 
comforting sound of fresh bills thudding out of the machine. 
Bateman turns around and watches a solitary young woman walk 
past him. He collects his money, placing it carefully in his 
wallet, and then walks toward her, whistling. He catches up 
to her as she pauses at a red light.BATEMANHello.

The woman looks suspicious for a moment and then, seeing 
his smile, smiles back.INT. DRY CLEANERS - DAYBateman, dressed in an Armani suit 
with an unlit cigar between his teeth is standing in a dry 
cleaners, arguing with the Chinese woman behind the 
counter.BATEMANListen, wait. You're not...shhh wait...
you're not giving me valid reasons.

The woman continues to speak to him in another language, 
grabbing at the sleeve of the jacket.BATEMANWhat are you trying to say to me?

Her husband has taken Bateman's horribly bloodstained 
sheets out of the bag and is staring at them.BATEMANBleach-ee? Are you trying to say bleach-ee? 
Bleach-ee. Oh my God.

She keeps pointing to the jacket and talking.BATEMAN(Talking over her) 
Two things. One. You can't bleach a Soprani. Out of the question. 
Two.
(Louder) 
Two. I can only get these sheets in Santa Fe. These are very 
expensive sheets and I really need them clean.

She keeps talking and Bateman leans into her.BATEMANIf you don't shut your fucking mouth I will kill 
you, are you understanding me?

She talks faster.BATEMANNow listen-I have a very important lunch meeting 
(Checks Rolex) 
at Hubert's in thirty minutes, and I need those 
...no wait, twenty minutes. I have a lunch meeting at 
Hubert's in twenty minutes with Ronald Harrison and I need 
those sheets cleaned by this afternoon.

She keeps talking.

BATEMAN Listen. I cannot understand you.

Bateman starts laughing, slaps his hand down on the 
counter.BATEMANThis is crazy. You're a fool. I can't cope with 
this.

Bateman is on the verge of tears.BATEMANStupid bitchee! Understand? Oh Christ!

Someone enters the store behind him. It's VICTORIA, 
late-twenties, attractive but a little overweight, wearing a 
tailored business suit with white sneakers and sports socks.VICTORIAPatrick?

She takes off her sunglasses.VICTORIAHi, Patrick. I thought that was you.BATEMANHello 
(Mumbles un incomprehensible name)

Awkward pause.BATEMANWell.VICTORIAIsn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, 
but you
know. They really are the best.BATEMANThen why can't they get these stains out? I mean can you talk 
to these people or something? I'm not getting anywhere.

Victoria moves toward the sheet that the old man is holding 
up. She
touches it and the woman behind the counter begins talking 
again.VICTORIAOh my, I see. What are those? Oh my.BATEMANUm, well...it s cranberry juice. Cranapple.

VICTORiA 
(Skeptically) Really?BATEMANWell, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You 
know, like...
like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?VICTORIA(As if sharing a secret joke) Oh yeah. Oh I get it. 
Fun with chocolate.BATEMANListen, if you could talk to them 
(He yanks the sheet out of the man's hand) 
I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a 
lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes.

Bateman turns to leave.VICTORIAHubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?BATEMANYeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank 
you, uh...
Victoria?VICTORIAMaybe we could have lunch one day next week? You 
know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.BATEMANOh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the 
time.VICTORIAWell, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?BATEMAN(Checking his watch) 
Next Saturday?VICTORIA(Shrugging) 
Yeah.BATEMANOh, can't, I'm afraid. Matin�e of Les Miserables. 
Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call 
you.VICTORIAOkay. Do.

Bateman glares at the woman behind the counter and rushes 
out the door. Victoria stares after him as we hear the sound 
of the bell on the closing door.INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - DAYBateman is sitting on the sofa watching a video, talking to 
Courtney on a portable phone. He's holding a video box in one 
hand, perusing the title: Inside Lydia's Ass. Offscreen we hear 
the sounds of the porn movie as he talks.BATEMANListen, what are you doing tonight?COURTNEYWhat? Oh, I'm...busy.BATEMANListen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, 
and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to 
tonight?COURTNEYStop it. I'm...BATEMANOn a lot of lithium?COURTNEYWaiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call 
tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.BATEMANYou should come have dinner with me.COURTNEYBut-when?BATEMANAm I confused or were we talking about tonight?COURTNEYUmmm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I 
need to be
home for that.BATEMANPumpkin?COURTNEYYes?BATEMANPumpkin you're dating an asshole.COURTNEYUh huh.BATEMANPumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New 
York.COURTNEYI know. Stop it.BATEMANPumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling 
dickweed.COURTNEYPatrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.BATEMANCourtney? Dinner?COURTNEYI can't.BATEMANI'm thinking Dorsia.COURTNEYDorsia's nice.BATEMANNice?COURTNEYYou like it there, don't you?BATEMANThe question is do you like it, Courtney? And will 
you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a 
boyfriend to eat there tonight.COURTNEYOkay. Yeah. What time?BATEMANEight?COURTNEYPick me up?BATEMANSounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear 
something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?

Bateman hangs up, opens up the Zagat's guide and dials the 
number for Dorsia with trembling fingers. It's busy and so 
he puts it on speakerphone, constant redial. He waits with 
his head in his hands, sweating with anxiety, until there 
is finally an answer.MAITRE D'Dorsia. Please hold.

He is on hold for a long time, getting very tense.MAITRE D'Dorsia.BATEMAN(Both of his eyes are closed) 
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to 
reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?

Long pause. The Maitre D' starts giggling quietly and then 
more loudly until the laughter is almost hysterical and he 
hangs up the phone.INT. TAXI- NIGHTBateman and Courtney are in the back of a cab. Courtney is
heavily medicated.COURTNEYA facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really 
relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this 
silver muffin dish. 
(She starts to pass out)BATEMANIs that Donald Trump's car?COURTNEY(Thickly) 
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.BATEMANYou know, Courtney, you should take some more 
lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you 
out of this slump.COURTNEYI just want to have a child. Just...two...
perfect...children...
(Her voice trails as she descends back into a drug haze)

The cab draws up outside a restaurant. The awning reads 
"Barcadia."INT. BARCADIA - NIGHTAn insanely expensive nouvelle Italian restaurant all 
polished natural brick, spotless white tablecloths, 
minimalist flower arrangements, discreet lighting.

A waiter has come to take their drink orders.BATEMANJ&B. Straight.COURTNEYChampagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with 
a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman 
leans over and pulls her back up.COURTNEYAre we here?BATEMANYes.COURTNEYThis is Dorsia?BATEMAN(Examining a menu that says "Barcadia" in large script) 
Yes, dear.

Courtney almost falls asleep while looking at her menu, and 
starts to slide off of her chair. Bateman grabs her by both 
shoulders and props her up.BATEMANCourtney, you're going to have the peanut butter 
soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine 
called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll 
love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and 
pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.COURTNEYMmmm...thanks, Patrick. 

She falls asleep at the table.INT. COURTNEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHTBateman and Courtney are in Courtney's bed. Bateman is on 
top of her, reaching for a condom in the ashtray. He tears 
it open with his teeth, puts it on.COURTNEY(Dazed on lithium) 
I want you to fuck me.

Bateman gets on top of her, starts to fuck her.COURTNEYLuis is a despicable twit.BATEMANYes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.

He keeps fucking her.COURTNEYNo, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" 
Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? 
Get off me.BATEMANIs it a what?COURTNEYPull out.BATEMANI'm ignoring you.COURTNEY(screaming) 
Pull out, goddamnit!BATEMAN(Slowing down but not stopping)
What do you want, Courtney?

She pushes him away from her.BATEMANIt's a plain end. I think.COURTNEYTurn the light on.

She tries to sit up.BATEMANOh Jesus. I'm going home.COURTNEYPatrick. Turn on the Light.
He turns on the light.BATEMANIt's a plain end, see? So?COURTNEYTake it off.BATEMANWhy?COURTNEYBecause you have to leave half an inch at the tip � 
(She covers herself with her comforter) 
to catch the force of the ejaculate!BATEMANI'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?

Courtney throws a pillow over her head and starts crying.COURTNEY(Screaming) 
Do you think you're turning me on by having unsafe sex?

Bateman pulls the pillow off her and slaps her face.BATEMANOh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, 
Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us. 
(He slaps her again lightly) 
Why is it pulled down half an inch? 
So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!COURTNEY(Choking crying) 
Well, it's not a turn-on for me. 
I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.

Bateman grabs her head and makes her look at the condom.BATEMANSee? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?COURTNEYOh God, just get it over with.

He fucks her quickly until he has a mediocre orgasm and 
falls down next to her. They lie side by side with their 
bodies not touching, eyes open, staring at the 
ceiling.INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, PIERCE & PIERCE - DAYBateman and Luis Carruthers are seated at a long table in 
the conference room at Pierce & Pierce, which looks out onto 
a spectacular view of Manhattan.CARRUTHERSPatrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney.
Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a 
reservation there?BATEMANLucky, I guess.CARRUTHERSThat's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, 
Valentino Couture?BATEMANUh huh.CARRUTHERS(Reaching out to touch it) 
It looks so soft.BATEMAN(Catching Luis hand) 
Your compliment was sufficient Luis.

Carruthers is distracted by a question from the colleague 
on his left.Paul Owen enters, carrying the Wall St. Journal 
under his arm. He is handsome, supremely confident and 
self-satisfied; he sees himself as a leader among men.OWEN(To Bateman) 
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?BATEMANI've been great. And you?

Their conversation fades down as we hear Bateman's 
thoughts.BATEMAN (V.O.)Owen has mistaken me for this dickhead Marcus Halberstam. 
It seems logical because Marcus also works at P&P and in 
fact does the same exact thing I do and he also has a 
penchant for Valentino suits and Oliver Peoples glasses. 
Marcus and I even go to the same barber, although I have 
a slightly better haircut.

During this voiceover the CAMERA WANDERS over to MARCUS 
HALBERSTAM, who is conferring with a colleague in the 
opposite corner of the room. He bears a 
superficial resemblance to Bateman.OWENHow's the Ransom account going, Marcus?BATEMAN(Nervous) 
It's...it's...all right.OWENReally? That's interesting. 
(He stares at Bateman, smiling)
Not great?BATEMANOh well, you know.OWENAnd how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.BATEMANOh yes. I'm very lucky.

McDermott and Price enter.

McDERMOTT 
Hey. Owen! Congratulations on the Fisher account.OWENThank you, Baxter.PRICEListen, Paul. Squash?OWENCall me. 
(Hands him a business card)PRICEHow about Friday?OWENNo can do. Got a res at eight-thirty at Dorsia. Great sea 
urchin ceviche. There is a stunned silence as he walks away 
and sits in a corner of the room, ostentatiously studying papers.

CLOSE-UP on Bateman's face, cold with hatred.PRICE(Whispering) 
Jesus. Dorsia? On a Friday night? How'd he swing that?

McDERMOTT (Whispering) 
I think he's lying.

Bateman takes out his wallet and pulls out a card.PRICE(Suddenly enthused) 
What's that, a gram?BATEMANNew card. What do you think?

McDermott lifts it up and examines the lettering carefully. 

McDERMOTT 
Whoa. Very nice. Take a look.

He hands it to Van Patten.BATEMANPicked them up from the printers yesterdayVAN PATTENGood coloring.BATEMANThat's bone. And the lettering is something called 
Silian Rail.

McDERMOTT 
(Envious) 
Silian Rail?VAN PATTENIt is very cool, Bateman. But that's nothing.

He pulls a card out of his wallet and slaps it on the 
table.VAN PATTENLook at this.

They all lean forward to inspect it.PRICEThat's really nice.

Bateman clenches his fists beneath the table, trying to 
control his anxiety.VAN PATTENEggshell with Romalian type. 
(Turning to Bateman)
What do you think?BATEMAN(Barely able to breath, his voice a croak) 
Nice.PRICE(Holding the card up to the light) 
Jesus. This is really super. How'd a nitwit like you get so 
tasteful?

Bateman stares at his own card and then enviously at 
McDermott's.BATEMAN (V.O.)I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.PRICEBut wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet. 

He holds up his own card.PRICERaised lettering, pale nimbus white...BATEMAN(Choking with anxiety) 
Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.

Price pulls a card from an inside coat pocket and holds it 
up for their inspection: "PAUL OWEN, PIERCE & PIERCE, 
MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS." Bateman swallows, speechless. 
The sound in the room dies down and all we hear is a faint 
heartbeat as Bateman stares at the magnificent card.BATEMAN (V.O.)Look at that subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness 
of it. Oh my God, it even has a watermark...

His hand shaking, Bateman lifts up the card and stares at it 
until it fills the screen.

He lets it fall. The SOUND RETURNS TO NORMAL.

CARRUTHERS Is something wrong? Patrick...you're sweating.EXT. STREET- EVENINGThe financial district. The streets are eerily deserted.

Bateman stands at an ATM, enjoying the reassuring sound of 
$500 in fresh bills thudding from the machine. As he turns 
to leave, he notices someone across the street.

A HOMELESS MAN is lying in a doorway on top of an open 
grate, surrounded by bags of garbage and a shopping cart. A 
cardboard sign is attached to the front of the cart: I AM 
HOMELESS AND HUNGRY PLEASE HELP ME. A small, thin dog lies 
next to him.

He is black, dressed in a stained, torn, lime-green 
polyester pants suit with jeans worn over the pants.BATEMAN(Offering his hand) Hello. Pat Bateman.

The Homeless Man stares at Bateman, struggling to sit up.BATEMANYou want some money?. Some...food?

The Homeless Man nods and starts to cry. Bateman reaches 
into his pocket and pulls out a $I 0 bill, then changes his 
mind and holds out a $5 instead.BATEMANIs this what you need?

The Homeless Man nods, looks away, wipes his nose.HOMELESS MANI'm so hungry.BATEMANIt's cold out, too, isn't it?HOMELESS MANI'm so hungry.BATEMAN(Holding the bill just out of the man's reach) 
Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you 
get a job?HOMELESS MAN(Shivering and sobbing) 
I lost my job...BATEMANWhy? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? 
Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on 
the job?

HOMELESS MAN I was fired. I was laid off.BATEMANGee, uh, that's too bad.HOMELESS MANI'm so hungry.

The dog starts to whimper.BATEMANWhy don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?HOMELESS MANI'm not...BATEMANYou're not what? Qualified for anything else?HOMELESS MANI'm hungryBATEMANI know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. 
I'm trying to help you.HOMELESS MANI'm hungry.BATEMANListen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who 
do have jobs? From people who do work?HOMELESS MANWhat am I gonna do?BATEMANListen, what's your name?HOMELESS MANAl.BATEMANSpeak up. Come on.HOMELESS MANAl.BATEMANGet a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. 
That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. 
I'll help you.HOMELESS MANYou re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind
man. I can tell.BATEMAN(Petting the dog) 
Shhhh...it's okay.HOMELESS MAN(Grabbing Bateman's wrist) 
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.BATEMAN(Stroking his face, whispering) 
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.HOMELESS MANI can't...I can't find a shelterBATEMANYou reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that? 
(Shouting)
Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of 
faggot. Al...I'm sorry.

Bateman carefully puts the money back in his wallet.BATEMANIt's just that...I don't know I don't have anything in common 
with you.

He opens his briefcase and pulls out a long thin knife with 
a serrated edge. He pushes up the sleeve of his jacket to 
protect it.BATEMANDo you know what a fucking loser ,you are?

HOMELESS MAN'S POV as Bateman lunges at him with the knife.

EXTREME WIDE SHOT of the street. Bateman's shadowed figure
is hunched over the Homeless Man, stabbing him in the stomach.
The dog barks wildly and Bateman stomps on it until it is 
silent.

LOW ANGLE shot of Bateman as he throws a quarter on the ground.BATEMANThere's a quarter. Go buy some gum.

Bateman walks calmly into the empty caverns of Wall Street. 
Cars drift past, their headlights momentarily illuminating the 
body left twitching on the ground.INT. BEAUTY SALON - DAYCLOSE-UP on Bateman's face and torso. His eyes are closed as a 
woman's hands rub cream into his face.FACIALISTWhat beautiful skin you have, Mr Bateman. So 
fine, so smooth...

His eyes open to look up at the facialist and then he 
closes them again.BATEMAN (V.O.)I have all the characteristics of a human being- flesh, blood, 
skin, hair-but not a single clear, identifiable emotion except 
for greed ,und disgust. Something horrible is happening inside 
me and I don't know why.CUT TO:Bateman sitting in a chair, looking down at the 
MANICURIST who is giving him a pedicure. She is cutting his 
nails with tiny sharp scissors. He stares at them longingly.BATEMAN (V.O.)My nightly bloodlust has overflowed into my days. I feel lethal, 
on the verge of frenzy.CUT TO:Bateman lying irradiated by ultraviolet light on a tanning 
bed, wearing goggles.BATEMAN (V.O.)I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.INT. TEXARKANA RESTAURANT - NIGHTAn insanely expensive nouvelle Tex-Mex restaurant, with an 
ironic Southwestern decor: Santa Fe colors, Navajo blankets, 
naive cowboy art, rawhide banquettes.

Bateman bursts in the door, late, and approaches the MAITRE D'.BATEMANMarcus Halberstam. For two at eight?MAITRE D'Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.

Paul Owen is seated at a table underneath an enormous pair of 
ram's horns. He is arguing with the WAITER.OWENNo, I want to know. I came here for the cilantro 
crawfish gumbo, which is after all the only excuse one 
could have for being in this restaurant, which is by the 
way, almost completely empty. Am I to believe that all ten 
people in this restaurant have eaten your entire supply of 
cilantro crawfish gumbo?WAITERI'm very sorry sir. There was a fire in the kitchen 
earlier today, and-BATEMANJ&B, straight. And a Dixie beer.WAITERWould you like to hear-OWENDouble Absolut martini.WAITERYes, sir. Would you like to hear the specials?BATEMANNot if you want to keep your spleen.

The Waiter leaves.OWENThis is a real beehive of, uh, activity, Halberstam. 

This place is hot, very hot.BATEMANListen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous 
here.OWENYeah, well, you're late.BATEMANHey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break 
(Studying the menu; he's in a surprisingly good mood) 
Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.OWENWe should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.BATEMANNobody goes there anymore.

There is a long disgruntled silence.BATEMANIs that Ivana Trump over there? (Laughs) Jeez 
Patrick I mean Marcus, what are you thinking? Why would Ivana 
be at Texarkana?

Another pause.BATEMANSo, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the 
Fisher account? How did you get it?OWENI could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have 
to kill you.

He guffaws. Bateman laughs politely.LATER:Paul Owen is very drunk. BATEMAN cold sober.BATEMANI like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane?

Owen continues laughing and motions to the waiter for another 
drink.OWENGreat tan, Marcus. Really impressive. Where do you tan?

BATEMAN Salon.OWENI've got a tanning bed at home. You should look into it.

Bateman nods, agitated.OWENAnd Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?BATEMANCecelia is, well...you know (Cecelia. I think 
she's having dinner with...Evelyn Williams.OWENEvelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick 
Bateman. What a dork.BATEMANAnother Martini, Paul?

Owen nods drunkenly.LATER:The end of the meal. Owen is squeezing a lime onto the 
table, missing his beer, incredibly drunk. The check is laid 
down.BATEMAN(Talking to Owen like a child) 
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy.
Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.BATEMANTwo-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave 
a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?OWENNo, man. I'm gonna bail.BATEMANCome on, you dumb son of a bitch. 
(Helping him into his jacket) 
I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a 
bottle of Absolut waiting for us.INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHTThe living room floor has been meticulously covered with 
newspaper.

Owen is slumped drunkenly in a white Eames chair, a glass 
in his hand. Bateman is looking through his CDs.BATEMANYou like Huey Lewis and the News?OWENThey're okay.BATEMANTheir early work was a little too New Wave for my 
taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really 
came into their own, commercially and artistically.

Bateman walks to his bathroom, taking a large ax out of the
shower. He takes two Valium.BATEMAN(Said partly from the bathroom) 
The whole album has a clear, crisp sound and a new sheen of 
consummate professionalism that gives the songs a big boost.
Bateman comes back out and leans the ax against the wall. 
He walks to the foyer and puts on a raincoat, watching Owen 
from behind ail the time.BATEMANHe's been compared to ELvis Costello but I think 
Huey has a more bitter, cynical sense of humor.

Owen is absent-mindedly leafing through the Barneys 
catalogue.OWENHey, Halberstam?BATEMANYes, Owen?OWENWhy are there copies of the Style section all over 
the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?BATEMANNo, Owen.OWEN(Confused) 
Is that a raincoat?BATEMANYes, it is.

Bateman moves to the CD player. He takes a CD out of its 
case and slides it in the machine.BATEMANIn 1987 Huey released this, Fore!, their most 
accomplished album. I think I heir undisputed masterpiece is 
"HiP To Be Square," a song so catchy that most people probably 
don't listen to the lyrics. But they should because it's not 
just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of 
trends. It's al~ a personal statement about the band itself.

Bateman puts on "Hip To Be Square."

BATEMAN crosses the room and picks up the ax.

We follow BATEMAN from behind as he walks up to Owen, the 
ax raised over his head.BATEMANHey, Paul?

As Owen turns around, FROM OWEN'S POV we see Bateman swing 
the ax toward his face.

Blood sprays onto the white raincoat.

FROM BEHIND OWEN, we see BATEMAN as he yanks the ax out.

Owen drops to the floor. His body falls out of the frame. 
We stay on his legs twitching mechanically.

Blood pulses onto the newspaper-covered floor.BATEMAN(Raising the ax and screaming) 
Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now, you fucking 
stupid bastard!

LOW ANGLE ON BATEMAN as he beats Owen with the back of the 
ax.

OFFSCREEN, the sound of the ax hitting Owen.BATEMAN(Panting) 
Fucking bastard...

Bateman takes his raincoat off, still panting. He folds the 
coat carefully in half, bloody side in, and drapes it neatly 
over the back of a chair.

He sits back on the white sofa and surveys the scene. He 
checks his Rolex and lights a cigar.

OFFSCREEN, Paul Owen's last faint sighs are heard.INT. LOBBY - NIGHTBATEMAN drags a large, blood-soaked sleeping bag through the lobby, 
past the bored doorman, who looks up from the Post for a moment.EXT. STREET - NIGHTBATEMAN is trying to hail a cab. Owen's body is at his 
feet. Luis Carruthers and a Japanese girl walk up to him.CARRUTHERSPatrick? Is that you?BATEMANNo, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.CARRUTHERSThis is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good 
friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to 
Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it. 
(Looking down at the body) 
Where did you get your overnight bag?BATEMANCommes des Garcon.

A cab stops. BATEMAN opens the door and manages to get 
Owen's body into the backseat.

Bateman gets into the cab.CARRUTHERSCall me please, Patrick.BATEMANJesus lives, Luis.INT. BATEMAN'S HELL'S KITCHEN APARTMENT - NIGHTA bare room, lit by one light bulb. The walls are blank 
except for a Les Miserables poster. There is one ratty chair.

Bateman pours lime over Paul Owen's body, which is lying in 
a bathtub. He plays Huey Lewis, smokes a cigar, watches the 
body dissolve.INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHTBateman is letting himself into the apartment. It is very 
similar to Bateman's, but even more minimalist. The walls 
are white-pigmented concrete with a large minimalist painting 
on the wall. One wall is covered in a trendy, large-scale 
scientific drawing above a long, black leather couch.BATEMANWhere to send the bastard? Dallas? Pans?

He throws some clothes into a suitcase, randomly grabbing 
toiletries and shoving them in.BATEMANSingapore? London. I'll send the asshole to London.

He puts some music on to help muffle his voice, then leans 
over the answering machine.

He does a passable imitation of Owen's speech.BATEMANHi, this is Paul. I've been called away to London 
for a few days. Meredith, I'll call you when I get back. 
Hasta la vista, baby.INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - MORNINGBateman is sitting at his desk, with the latest copy of 
Sports Illustrated in front of him and his Walkman playing 
Kenny G. We hear the MUSIC until Jean enters and he takes 
the Walkman off.BATEMAN(Faintly irritable) 
What is it?JEANPatrick?BATEMAN(Condescendingly) 
Ye-es, Je-an?JEANPatrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.BATEMANWho?JEANDetective Donald KIMBALL?

Silence. Bateman stares out the window, then down at the 
drawing of a headless woman he's been doodling on the back 
cover of Sports Illustrated.BATEMANTell him I'm at lunch.JEAN(whispering) 
Patrick, I think he knows you're here. 
It's only ten-thirty. 

Silence.BATEMANSend him in, I guess. As she exits, he picks up the cordless 
phone and pretends to talk to someone at the other end.BATEMANNow, John, you've got to wear clothes in proportion 
to your physique. There are definite do's and don'ts, good 
buddy, of wearing a bold-striped shirt. A hold-striped shirt 
calls for solid-colored or discreetly patterned suits and ties...

The door to the office opens and he waves in DETECTIVE DONALD 
KIMBALL. KIMBALL is surprisingly young - about Bateman's age - 
and good-looking, dressed in a crumpled linen Armani suit of 
the type Bateman and his friends might wear.

Kimball sits down and crosses his legs with a 
self-assurance that makes Bateman so nervous he forgets to 
carry on with his fake conversation. Kimball looks up at 
him curiously, noticing the silence.BATEMAN(Realizing that Kimball is staring at him) 
Right. And yes...always tip the stylist fifteen percent.

Bateman shrugs at the detective, rolling his eyes in 
exasperation. 

KIMBALL nods understandingly.BATEMANListen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just 
walked in...
(He laughs inanely) 
Just joking...
(Pause) 
No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, 
right, got it. 
(He hangs up the phone and pushes the antenna in) 
Sorry about that.KIMBALLNo, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment. 
(Gesturing toward the phone) 
Was that anything important?BATEMANOh that? Just mulling over business problems. 
Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors...
Spreading gossip.

They laugh politely.KIMBALL(Holding out his hand) 
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALLBATEMAN(Shaking firmly) 
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.KIMBALLI'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed 
to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well, 
you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get.

KIMBALL stares at the three open copies of Sports 
Illustrated and the Sony Walkman lying on Bateman's desk. 
Bateman sees the look and sweeps the magazines 
into the top drawer along with the Walkman, which is 
still running.BATEMAN(Forcing himself to sound friendly and relaxed) 
So, what's the topic of discussion?KIMBALLI've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate 
the disappearance of Paul Owen.BATEMANYou're not with the FBI or anything, are you?KIMBALLNothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.BATEMANAh, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.KIMBALLSo it's nothing that official. I just have some 
basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-BATEMANCoffee?KIMBALLNo. I'm okay.BATEMANPerrier? San Pellegrino?KIMBALLNo, I'm okay.

KIMBALL takes out a small black notepad and the same gold 
Cross pen that Bateman and his friends all use. Bateman buzzes 
Jean.JEAN (O.S.)Patrick?BATEMANCan you bring Mr...KIMBALLKIMBALL.BATEMANMr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-KIMBALLOh no, I'm okay.BATEMANIt's no problem

Bateman watches intently as KIMBALL writes something down 
in his notebook, then crosses something out. Jean enters 
and places the bottle of San Pellegrino and a Steuben etched 
glass on the table, shooting a concerned glance at Bateman. 
He glares at her. KIMBALL smiles and nods at Jean as she leaves.BATEMANWell, what's the topic of discussion?KIMBALLThe disappearance of Paul Owen.BATEMANOh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the 
disappearance or anything...
(Trying to laugh) 
Not on "Page Six" at least.KIMBALLI think his family wants this kept quiet.BATEMANUnderstandable. 
(Staring at the untouched bottle of San Pellegrino) 
Lime?KIMBALLNo, really. I'm okay.BATEMANYou sure? I can always get you a lime.

A pause.KIMBALLJust some preliminary questions that I need for my own 
files, okay?BATEMANShoot.KIMBALLHow old are you?BATEMANTwenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.KIMBALL(Scribbling in his notebook) 
Where did you go to school?BATEMANHarvard. The Harvard Business School.KIMBALLYour address?BATEMANFifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American
Gardens Building.KIMBALL(Looking up, impressed) 
Nice. Very nice.BATEMAN(Flattered) 
Thanks.

A pause as KIMBALL studies his notebook. Bateman closes his
eyes, as if in pain.KIMBALLPardon me, but are you okay?BATEMANWho do you ask?KIMBALLYou seem...nervous.

Bateman reaches into his desk drawer and brings out a 
bottle of aspirin.BATEMANNuprin?

KIMBALL Uh...no, thanks.

Kimball takes out a pack of Marlboro's and lays it on the 
desk.BATEMANBad habit.KIMBALLI know. I'm sorry.

A pause, as Bateman stares at the cigarettes.KIMBALLWould you rather I not smoke?BATEMANNo, I guess it's okay.KIMBALLYou sure?BATEMANNo problem. 
(Buzzing Jean)JEAN (O.S.)Yes, Patrick?BATEMANBring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please.
She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.KIMBALLWhat can you tell me about Paul Owen?BATEMANWell...

He coughs, shakes two Nuprin into his hand and swallows 
them dry.KIMBALLHow well did you know him?BATEMANI'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, 
you know.KIMBALLYale thing?

A pause.BATEMANYeah...Yale thing.KIMBALLWhat do you mean...Yale thing?

A pause.BATEMANWell, I think for one that he was probably a closet 
homosexual. Who did a lot of cocaine...that Yale thing.

A silence during which the sound of the air conditioner 
becomes deafening.KIMBALLSo...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul 
Owen?BATEMANHe led what I suppose was an orderly life. He...
ate a balanced diet.KIMBALLWhat kind of man was he? Besides...
(He hesitates tries to smile) 
the information you've just given.BATEMANI hope I'm not being cross-examined here.KIMBALLDo you feel that way?BATEMANNo. Not really.KIMBALL(As he writes without looking up) 
Where did Paul hang out?BATEMANHang...out?KIMBALLYeah. You know...hang out.BATEMANLet me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine.
Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular 
places.KIMBALLHe had a yacht?BATEMANNo, he just hung out there.KIMBALLAnd where did he go to school?

A slight pause.BATEMANDon't you know this?KIMBALLI just wanted to know if you know.BATEMANBefore Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's...
Listen, I just...I just want to help.KIMBALLI understand.

He makes another note.KIMBALLAnything else you can tell me about Owen?BATEMANWe were both seven in 1969.KIMBALL(Smiles) 
So was I.BATEMANDo you have any witnesses or fingerprints?KIMBALLWell, there's a message on his answering machine saying he 
went to London.BATEMANWell, maybe he did, huh?KIMBALLHis girlfriend doesn't think so.BATEMANBut...has anyone seen him in London?KIMBALLActually, yes.BATEMANHmmm.KIMBALLWell, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. 
A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but 
I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert 
Ainsworth for Paul, so...BATEMANOh.KIMBALLWas he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan
worship?BATEMANWhat?KIMBALLI know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I 
know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't 
know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was 
recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano 
girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-BATEMANYikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced 
diet and-KIMBALLYeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.

A pause - the longest so far.BATEMANHave you consulted a psychic?KIMBALLNo.BATEMANHad his apartment been burglarized?KIMBALLNo, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A 
suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.BATEMANI mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet 
or anything, right?KIMBALLNo, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But...
basically no one has seen or heard anything.BATEMANThat's so typical, isn't it?KIMBALLIt's just strange. 
(He stares out the window, lost in thought) 
One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, 
and then...BATEMANNothing.KIMBALLPeople just...disappear.BATEMANThe earth just opens up and swallows people. 
(He checks his Rolex)KIMBALLEerie. Really eerie.

Silence.BATEMAN(Standing up) 
You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting 
with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.KIMBALLIsn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I 
mean aren't you going to be late?BATEMANUh, no. There's one...down here.KIMBALLOh really? I didn't know that.

Bateman leads him to the door.BATEMANYes. It's very good.

KIMBALL turns to face him.KIMBALLListen, if anything occurs to you, any information 
at all...BATEMANAbsolutely, I'm 100% with you.KIMBALLGreat, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman.

Bateman closes the door firmly on KIMBALL. He closes his 
eyes and leans against the door, sweating.INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOONA perfectly lit kitchen still-life - a bottle of Evian, 
a white porcelain plate on which sits a sliced kiwi, some perfect 
green grapes, a few berries.

OFFSCREEN, the SOUND OF SCREAMS AND A CHAINSAW can be heard 
from the living room.

The living room: Bateman is maniacally doing abdominal 
crunches as the television plays a video of Texas Chainsaw 
Massacre. There is a pile of horror videos on his coffee table, 
next to a copy of GQ.LATER:Bateman is sitting in his armchair, phone book in hand, 
jerking off. He is squealing into the phone and breathing.BATEMANYou like that, slut?

The person on the other end clearly hangs up.

CLOSE-UP on his fingers dialing the phone.BATEMANYou want to know what I'm wearing? Sixty-dollar 
boxer shorts by Ralph Lauren, a hundred-and-fifty-dollar white 
cotton T-shirt by 
Commes des Garcons. 
(He snorts like a pig) 
My Rolex cost-

Another hang-up. He dials again.BATEMAN(Whipering) 
I'm a corporate raider. I orchestrate hostile takeovers. What do 
you think of that? 
(Makes disgusting sucking noises and grunts) 
Huh, bitch?GIRL (O.S.)Dad, is that you?

Bateman hangs up, frustrated.EXT. STREET/INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHTBateman cruises around in the limo. It pulls up alongside 
CHRISTIE, a pretty blonde hooker in shorts and leather jacket. 
Bateman opens his window to speak to her.BATEMANI haven't seen you around here.CHRISTIEYou just haven't been looking.BATEMANWould you like to see my apartment?

Bateman flips on the light inside the limo. He's wearing a 
tuxedo.CHRISTIE(looking away to some dark corner) 
I'm not supposed to.

Bateman is holding out a $100 bill, which Christie now 
notices, then takes.BATEMANDo you want to come to my apartment or not?CHRISTIEI'm not supposed to. 
(She pockets the bill) 
But I can make an exception.BATEMANDo you take American Express?

Christie is still looking out behind her.BATEMANDo you take American Express?

Christie looks at him like he's crazy.BATEMANI'm joking. Come on, get in.

As they drive uptown, Bateman dials the cell-phone. He 
reads off a credit card number.BATEMANI'd like a girl, early twenties, blonde, who does 
couples. Couples. Fifty-five West Eighty-First, the 
American Gardens Building. Apartment 7C. And I really 
can't stress blonde enough. Blonde.

He hangs up.

BATEMAN I'm Paul. My name is Paul 0wen, have you'got that? 
You are Christie. You are to respond only to Christie. Is 
that clear?INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHTChristie is in the bathtub, Bateman is pouring in white 
milky bath oil.BATEMANThat's a very fine Chardonnay you're drinking.

Long pause, in which Christie is luxuriating in the tub and 
Bateman is casually touching her breast.BATEMANI want you to clean your vagina.

Christie reaches for a washcloth.BATEMANNo. From behind. Get on your knees.

Christie shrugs.BATEMANI want to watch. You have a very nice body.

The doorman RINGS. Bateman answers.BATEMANThank you. Send her up. Christie, get out and dry 
off, choose a robe-not the Bijan and come and meet me and 
our guest in the living room for drinks.

Bateman answers the door.BATEMANYou've arrived! How lovely, let me take your coat. 
I'm Paul. How good of you to come.

The escort girl looks somewhat bewildered. Bateman takes 
her coat and inspects her body and face.BATEMANNot quite blonde, are you? More dirty blonde. I'm 
going to call you Sabrina. I'm Paul Owen.

Bateman escorts her into the living room and brings her a 
glass of wine. Christie enters, sitting next to Sabrina on the 
couch, and Bateman sits across from them. There is a 
long silence.BATEMANSo, don't you want to know what I do?

The two girls look at each other with uncomfortable smiles. 
Christie shrugs.CHRISTIENo.SABRINA(Smiling) 
No, not really.

Bateman is visibly irritated, recrosses his legs.BATEMANWell, I work on Wall Street. At Pierce & Pierce. 
(Long pause) 
Have you heard of it?

Another long pause. They shake their heads. Christie stands 
up and goes over to the CD collection.CHRISTIEYou have a really nice place here...Paul. 
How much did you pay for it?BATEMANActually, that's none of your business, Christie, 
hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.

Bateman leaves to refill his wine glass and Sabrina takes a 
pack of cigarettes out of her purse.
Bateman returns, carrying a tray of chocolates.BATEMANNo, no smoking. Not in here.

He walks over to Christie.BATEMANVarda truffle?

Christie stares at the plate and shakes her head. Sabrina 
takes one.BATEMANI don't want you to get drunk, but that's a very 
fine Chardonnay you're not drinking.

Bateman goes over to his CDs and scans his vast collection. 
He takes one out and examines it.BATEMANDo you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis 
fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before 
that I really didn't understand any of their work. It was too 
artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins' 
presence became more apparent. He puts aside the CD and takes out 
another one.BATEMANI think "Invisible Touch" is the group's undisputed
masterpiece.

He puts on the song and gestures for them to follow him 
into the bedroom.BATEMANIt's an epic meditation on intangibility, at the 
same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding 
three albums. Christie, take off the robe.

Bateman puts out a lace teddy. He motions to Christie to 
put it on.BATEMANListen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, 
Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance 
of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress.

Bateman starts to undress.BATEMANIn terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer 
songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. 
Sabrina, why don't you dance a little?

Sabrina dances awkwardly. Christie sits on the bed.BATEMANTake the lyrics to "Land of Confusion." In this 
song, Phil Collins addresses the problem of abusive political 
authority.

Bateman knots a silk scarf around Christie's neck - rather 
menacingly - then helps her into some suede gloves.BATEMAN"In Too Deep" is the most moving pop song of the 1980s about 
monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. 
Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything 
I've heard in rock.

He turns on the video camera.BATEMANChristie, get down on your knees, so Sabrina can see your 
asshole.

Bateman looks through the viewfinder.BATEMANPhill Collins solo efforts seem to be more commercial and 
therefore more satisfying in a narrower way, especially 
songs like "In the Air Tonight" and "Against 
All Odds." Sabrina, don't just stare at it. Eat it. 

He walks over to the sound system in his bedroom and slides in 
the CD.BATEMANBut I also think that Phill Collins works better 
within the confines of the group than as a solo artist-and 
I stress the word artist. This is "Sussudio," a great, 
great song, a personal favorite.

SEX MONTAGE CUT TO "Sussudio." We see this in WIDE SHOT, or 
through the LENS OF THE VIDEO CAMERA.CUT TO:Bateman asleep in his bed with Christie and Sabrina 
on either side of him. Sabrina accidentally touches his 
wrist. Bateman's eyes open.BATEMANDon't touch the Rolex.

Bateman gets up from his bed and goes over to his armoire.

He opens the drawer in which are a nail gun, a coat hanger, 
a rusty butter knife and a half-smoked cigar. He turns 
around to see Christie and Sabrina both starting to get up 
and get dressed. He takes the coat hanger.BATEMANWe're not through yet...CUT TO:Bateman ushering them out the door impatiently. They 
are both sobbing, badly bruised and bleeding. Bateman has a 
deep scratch on his hand and one on his shoulder. In the 
b.g. Phil Collins' "In the Air Tonight" is playing.INT. YALE CLUB � DAYMcDermott, Van Patten and Bateman are 
having drinks. Price walks by with a gorgeous girl and 
gives them the finger.BATEMANWhat an asshole.

McDERMOTT 
Why is Laurie Kennedy dating Price? He's a 
fucking drug addict. No self-control.VAN PATTENBut Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do 
you think, Bateman?BATEMANI know her. I knew her.

McDERMOTT 
Why do you say it like that? Why does he say it 
like that?VAN PATTENBecause he dated her.BATEMANHow did you guess?VAN PATTENGirls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, 
Bateman.BATEMANThanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy 
personality.

McDERMOTT 
So what? It's all looks. Laurie Kennedy is a 
babe. Don't even pretend you were interested for any other 
reason.VAN PATTENIf they have a good personality, then something 
is very wrong.

McDERMOTT 
If they have a good personality and they are not 
great looking-who fucking cares?BATEMANWell, let's just say hypothetically, okay? What if 
they have a good personality? 
(He smiles giving up) 
I know, I know-ALL IN UNISONThere are no girls with good personalities! 
(They laugh and high-five each other)VAN PATTENA good personality consists of a chick with a 
little hardbody who will satisfy all sexual demands without 
being too slutty about things and who will essentially keep 
her dumb fucking mouth 
shut.

McDERMOTT 
Listen, the only girls with good personalities who are
smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or even 
talented-though God knows what the fuck that means-are ugly 
chicks.VAN PATTENAbsolutely.

McDERMOTT 
And this is because they have to make up for how 
fucking unattractive they are.

Pause.BATEMANDo you know what Ed Gein said about women?VAN PATTENEd Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?BATEMANNo, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was 
an interesting guy.

McDERMOTT 
So what did Ed say?BATEMANHe said, "When I see a pretty girl walking down the 
street I think two things. One part of me wants to take her 
out and talk to her and be real nice and sweet and treat 
her right."

Pauses, finishes his drink.

McDERMOTT 
What does the other part of him think?BATEMANWhat her head would look like on a stick.

McDermott and Van Patten look at each other and then back 
at Bateman. Bateman starts to laugh, and the other two uneasily
join In.

Luis Carruthers walks up to the table.CARRUTHERS(Shyly) 
Hi, guys. I wanna get your opinion on something.

McDermott rolls his eyes at the rest of the table.

McDERMOTT If it's about the bow-tie you're wearing, you 
know how we feel about it. Luis laughs good-naturedly.CARRUTHERSYes, I do. No, it's my business card-I decided to 
get a new one too.

He pulls out something incredibly tasteful. Everyone 
compliments Luis except Bateman. The SOUND DROPS and all we hear 
is the beating of his heart as he stares at the card enviously. 
Luis plucks it from his hand and walks away, pleased with 
himself.VAN PATTENListen, what about dinner?BATEMAN(Suddenly angry) 
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about 
fucking dinner?" 

McDERMOTT 
Ah, cheer up, Bateman. 
(Slaps him on the back, massages his neck) 
What's the matter? No shiatsu this morning?BATEMAN(Watching Luis going into the men's room) 
Keep touching me like that and you'll draw back a stump.

McDERMOTT 
Whoa, hold on there, little buddy.BATEMANExcuse me.

He gets up from the table. As Bateman walks away, Van 
Patten grabs a waiter.VAN PATTENIs this tap water? I don't drink tap water Bring 
me an Evian or something, okay?INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAYBateman pulls on his gloves as he 
enters the men's room. Carruthers is standing in a stall with his 
back to Bateman. The sound of his urinating is heard until Bateman 
approaches, then abruptly stops. Slowly, Bateman brings his hands 
up over the collar of Carruthers' cashmere jacket, circling his 
neck until both thumbs and index fingers meet. All we can hear 
is the sound of Bateman's heavy breathing. Slowly he starts to 
squeeze. Almost in slow motion, Carruthers turns around.

Carruthers looks down at Bateman's wrists as if lost in 
thought. Then he lowers his head and kisses Bateman's 
wrist. He looks back at Bateman with a shy, love-struck 
expression, then reaches up and tenderly touches the side 
of his face.CARRUTHERSGod, Patrick. Why here?

He strokes Bateman's hair.CARRUTHERSI've seen you looking at me. I've noticed your hot body.

Carruthers tries to kiss him on the lips but Bateman backs 
away. He drops his hands from Carruthers' neck. Carruthers 
immediately takes them and places them back. Bateman drops 
them again.CARRUTHERSDon't be shy.

Bateman takes a deep breath, closes his eyes and tries to lift 
his hands again, but abandons the attempt.CARRUTHERSYou don't know how long I've wanted it. Ever since that Christmas 
party at Arizona 206. You know the one, you were wearing that 
red-striped paisley Armani tie.

Bateman looks down and sees that Carruthers' pants are 
still unzipped. He moves past him out of the stall and 
stands by the sink and pretends to wash his hands until he 
realizes he still has his gloves on. Carruthers comes up 
behind him.CARRUTHERSI want you. I want you...too.

Bateman storms out of the men's room, bumping into a waiter 
and several customers and cursing. Noticing the maitre d' 
and another waiter conferring and looking at him strangely, 
Bateman straightens up and smiles and waves cheerfully at 
them. Carruthers walks up behind him.BATEMAN(Hissing) 
What...is...it?CARRUTHERSWhere are you going?BATEMAN(Stumbling away from him) 
I've gotta...I've 
gotta...return some videotapes.CARRUTHERSPatrick?BATEMANWhat?CARRUTHERS(Silently mouthing the words) 
I'll call you.

Bateman storms out of the restaurant.INT. COURTNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHTBateman is lying on top of Courtney in her bed, after sex. 
Still panting, he rolls off her, onto his back. He feels 
something lumpy underneath him and pulls out a stuffed toy, 
a black cat with blue jewel eyes. There is silence.COURTNEYWill you call me before Thanksgiving?BATEMANMaybe.

Courtney sighs and reaches for a bottle of pills on her 
nightstand, swallowing several. Bateman gets up and begins 
to dress, admiring himself in the mirror. Courtney watches 
the TV at low volume.COURTNEYWhat are you doing tonight?BATEMANDinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.COURTNEYThat's nice.BATEMANYou and...Luis?COURTNEY(Lighting a cigarette) 
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and 
Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...BATEMANI never knew you smoked.COURTNEY(Smiling sadly) 
You never noticed.

Bateman is making final adjustments to his tie.COURTNEYListen...Patrick. Can we talk?BATEMANYou look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're 
going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.COURTNEY(Sarcastically) 
Isn't that special? 
(A pause) 
Patrick?BATEMANYes, Courtney?C0URTNEYIf I don't see you before Thanksgiving, have a nice one, okay?BATEMAN(Flatly) 
You too.

Courtney picks up the black cat and starts petting its 
head. Bateman heads down the hallway to the front door.COURTNEYPatrick?BATEMANYes?COURTNEYNothing.INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHTA big eighties nightclub with a mixed crowd: hip-hop 
kids, visitors from Jersey, downtown art people, yuppies.

I Bateman makes his way through the crowd to the bar, and 
tries to attract the bartender's attention. He is wearing a 
suit and his tie is loosened. Kimball approaches him.KIMBALLMr. Bateman?

Bateman gasps and recovers.BATEMANDetective Kendall...uh Campbell?KIMBALLKimball. 
(Extending his hand) 
Call me Don.BATEMANDon.KIMBALLSo...you hang out here a lot?BATEMANUh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You 
know.

Pause.BATEMANHow's the investigation going? Taken anyone 
in for "formal questioning?" (He makes quotation marks 
in the air and laughs a not-so-relaxed laugh)KIMBALL0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?BATEMANYeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.KIMBALL(Looking at his glass) 
Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much 
more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, 
don't you think?

Bateman is nodding nervously, idiotically.KIMBALLSome people just can t help themselves. Another Stoli?

Bateman shakes his head.KIMBALLI mean they want to get caught.BATEMANDan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need 
anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean 
Owen was a...complex man.

Bateman wanders away.

He looks back uneasily at KIMBALL, who is watching him from 
the bar. A GUY WITH DREADLOCKS walks by.BATEMAN(Holding up his hand to high-five) Rasta Man!

The man stares at him.BATEMANI mean-Mon. We be jammin'...

The man walks by, shaking his head.

Bateman wanders into the next room, which is filled with a 
more familiar crowd: young men in designer suits, girls in 
black designer dresses. Across the room he spots McDermott 
and Price sitting with three models, all wearing black 
mini-dresses. Price and McDermott are having a whispered 
argument.PRICEI have to talk to these girls? They're models.

McDERMOTT 
Someone has to get the Bolivian marching powder. 
You went last time. Stay here.

McDermott waves gaily to the girls and disappears.
Bateman looks at the models. DAISY and CARON are staring 
into space, smoking. LIBBY is trying to work out how to 
unfold her napkin. Price signals to Bateman for help.PRICE(Clapping his hands together) 
Let's have a conversation. So...it was hot out today, no?

Silence.LIBBYWhere did Craig go?PRICEWell, Gorbachev is downstairs. McDermott is going to 
sign a peace treaty with him between the United States 
and Russia. McDermott's the one behind glasnost, you know.LIBBYWell...yeah. But he told me he was in mergers and acquisitions.PRICEYou're not confused, are you?LIBBYNo, not really.CARONGorbachev's not downstairs.DAISY(Smiling) 
Are you Iying?PRICEYes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's 
at Tunnel.BATEMAN(To Daisy) 
Ask me a question.DAISYSo, what do you do?BATEMANWhat do you think I do?DAISYA model? An actor?BATEMANNo. Flattering, but no.DAISYWell...BATEMANI m into, well, murders and executions mostly.

DAISY (Unfazed) 
Do you like it?BATEMANWelt...it depends, why?DAISYWell, most guys I know who work in mergers and 
acquisitions don't really like it.

Silence.BATEMANSo, where do you work out?MUCH LATER IN THE EVENING:The club is half-empty now. Price is leaning over a 
balcony, messed-up on drugs. Bateman comes up behind him 
in a menacing way that suggests he might push him over 
the railing. Price turns around, wild-eyed, just as Bateman 
is reaching for him.PRICE(Shouting)
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.BATEMANLeaving what?PRICEThis.

Bateman is confused, he thinks Price is referring to his 
drink.BATEMANDon't, I'll drink it.PRICE(Screaming) 
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.BATEMANWhere to? Are you going to go get a gram?PRICEI'm leaving! I...am...leaving!BATEMANDon't tell me...merchant banking?PRICENo, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm 
disappearing.BATEMAN(laughing) 
Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What?

Price looks away.

McDermott and Daisy walk up to them.

McDERMOTT 
Hey-don't worry, be happy.

Price lifts his arms up as if greeting the crowd and is 
shouting something that can't be heard, thenPRICEGoodbye! Fuckheads!

He climbs over the railing.

DAISY What is he doing?BATEMANPrice! Come back!

Price leaps from the balcony. He disappears for a moment 
then resurfaces and runs off into the crowd.EXT. CLUB - NIGHTBateman and Daisy are waiting for a cab.DAISYMy ex-boyfriend, Fiddler, who was in there, he plays 
in this band that just opened for U2-he couldn't understand

He said you gave him bad vibes.BATEMANThat's...that's too bad.DAISYYou think I'm dumb, don't you?BATEMANWhat?DAISYYou think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.BATEMAN(insincerely) No. I really don't.DAISYThat's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.

in the hallway and tucks some long blonde hair back inside the 
case.INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOONBateman sits at his desk wearing Wayfarers doing the New York 
Times crossword puzzle at dusk.

Jean knocks gently on the half-open door and walks in with 
a folder in her hand. Bateman ignores her.JEANDoin' the crossword?

Bateman nods without looking up.JEANNeed help?

BATEMAN doesn't respond. We see that every space on the 
puzzle has been filled in with the words MEAT or BONE. Jean 
drops the folder on his desk and then walks out.BATEMANJean?JEAN(Re-enters office) 
Yes, Patrick?BATEMANWould you like to accompany me to dinner?

He erases one of the M's on the crossword puzzle.BATEMANThat is...if you're not doing anything.JEANOh no. I have no plans.BATEMAN(Lowering his Wayfarers) 
Well, isn't this a coincidence.

A pause.BATEMANListen, where should we go?

He leans back and pulls a Zagat's from the desk drawer.JEANAnywhere you want?BATEMANLet's not think about what I want. How about 
anywhere you want.JEANOh Patrick, I can't make this decision.BATEMANNo, come on. Anywhere you want.JEANOh, I can't. 
(Sighs) 
I don't know.BATEMANCome on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want.
Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.

A long pause.JEANWhat about...Dorsia?

Bateman stops looking through the Zagat's guide and smiles 
at her.BATEMANSoooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...JEANOh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.BATEMANDorsia is...fine.

He dials the number.MAITRE D'Dorsia, yes?BATEMANYes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at

also totally booked.BATEMANSee you then.

He hangs up the phone. He walks over to the coat rack. He 
glances over at Jean, who is still standing in front of the 
desk, confused.BATEMANYes? You're dressed...okay.JEANYou didn't give them a name.BATEMANThey know me.

Pause.BATEMANWhy don't you meet me at my house at seven o'clock

Bateman opens up the freezer where Daisy's head is cleady 
visible.BATEMANJean? Sorbet?JEANThanks, Patrick. I'd love some.

Bateman walks in with a bottle of wine and a corkscrew in 
his hand and hands her the sorbet.

Jean is eating the sorbet.JEANWant a bite?BATEMANI'm on a diet. But thank you.JEANYou don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? 
You look great. Very fit.BATEMAN(Weighing the corkscrew examining the point for sharpness) 
You can always he thinner. Look...better.JEANWell, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't 
want to ruin your willpower.BATEMANNo. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling 
it anyway.

Silence, as Bateman walks around his apartment, opens up 
his knife drawer, looking at the knives.BATEMANSo listen, what do you really want to do with your 
life?

Pause.BATEMANAnd don't tell me you enjoy working with children, 
okay?JEANWell, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, 
but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life 
where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so...
I don't know...unsure.

Bateman is touching a knife in the drawer, feeling the edge 
of the blade.BATEMANDo you have a boyfriend?JEANNo, not really.BATEMANInteresting.JEAN(Shyly) 
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?BATEMANMaybe. I don't know Not really.
Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very 
Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly
ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, 
twine and a nail gun.BATEMANJean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?JEANWell, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused 
on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about 
changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.BATEMANGrowing. I'm glad you said that.

Bateman picks up the duct tape.BATEMANDid you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, 
was named Lassie? Had you heard this?JEANWho's Ted Bundy?BATEMANForget it.JEANWhat's that?BATEMANOh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for...
taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the 
nail gun.JEANPatrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?

Jean puts her spoon down on the table.BATEMAN(Looking up from loading nails into the gun) 
What...No! Put it in the carton.JEANSorry. 
(She puts the spoon in the carton)BATEMANJean? What?JEANMake someone happy-have you ever wanted to?

From behind, we follow Bateman as he walks across the room and
stands behind the couch.BATEMANI'm looking for...I guess you could say I just 
want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.JEANHmmmm. 

He points the nail gun at the back of Jean's head.
The phone RINGS. Startled, Bateman hides the nail gun 
behind his back. The answering machine picks up. As Bateman 
listens he discreetly places the nail gun behind the couch. 
He sits down opposite Jean, enjoying her discomfort as she 
listens to the message.EVELYNPatrick I know you're there. Pick up the phone, you bad boy. 
What are you up to tonight? It's me. Don't try to hide. I hope 
you're not out with some little number you picked up because 
you're my Mr. Bateman. My boy next door. Anyway you never 
called me and you said you would and I'll leave a message for 
Jean about this too to remind you but we're having dinner with 
Melania and Taylor-you know Melania, she went to Sweet Briar, 
auld Taylor, he went to Cornell-and we're meeting at the Cornell 
Club, so l'll call you tomorrow morning probably-bye, honey-oopps! 
You hate that. Bye Mr. Big Time CEO Patrick. Bye. Bye.

Silence. Jean is obviously embarrassed and upset.JEANWas that...Evelyn?

Silence.JEANAre you still seeing her?

Silence.JEANI'm sorry, I have no right to ask that.

Silence.JEANDo you want me to go?

A long pause.BATEMANYes. I don t think I can...control myself.JEANI know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get 
involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you 
want me to go?

Another long pause.BATEMANIf you stay, I think something bad will happen. I 
think I might hurt you. 
(Almost hopefully) 
You don't want to get hurt, do you?JEANNo. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. 
You're right, I should go.

She gets up to leave.JEANAnd don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with 
Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.BATEMANThanks. It slipped my mind completely.

He sinks back on the sofa and shuts his eyes.INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - DAYBateman enters P&P, walks up the corridor and pauses outside 
the door to his office. He sees KIMBALL in conversation with 
Jean, and Jean looking through her date book. He watches for 
a moment, frozen with anxiety. He then bursts in, shutting 
the door behind him.BATEMANKimball-I've been wanting to talk with you, Come 
into my office. Jean, great jacket. Matsuda?

Jean looks flustered.

Kimball follows Bateman into his office.KIMBALLI actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's 
taken a leave of absence.BATEMANYeah, gone into rehab. Shame. 
(Hopefully) 
Is he a suspect?KIMBALLNot really.

A pause.KIMBALLDo you remember where you were on the night of 
Paul's disappearance? 
(He checks his notebook) 
Which was on the twentieth of December?BATEMANGod...I guess...I was probably returning 
videotapes.

He opens his desk drawer and pretends to search through his 
diary.BATEMANI had a date with a girl named Veronica.KIMBALLWait. That's not what I've got.BATEMANWhat?KIMBALLThat's not the information I've received.BATEMANWell...I...Wait...What information have 
you received?KIMBALLLet's see...
(He flips through his notebook) 
That you were with-BATEMANWell, I could he wrong.KIMBALLWell...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?BATEMAN(Clearly nervous and under pressure) 
We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It 
was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner 
at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I 
physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't 
remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's.

Kimball is clearly giving up on Bateman for now. He opens 
his briefcase to put away his notebook.KIMBALLWell, thank you, Mr. Bateman.BATEMANPatrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long 
day-a bit scattered.KIMBALLListen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch 
in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?BATEMANGreat, yes, I'd like that.KIMBALLAnd if you could try and pin down where you were 
the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a 
lot easier.BATEMANAbsolutely. I'm with you on that one.

Kimball is rifling through his briefcase. He pulls out a 
new shrink wrapped CD and holds it up.KIMBALLHuey Lewis and the News. Great stuff. Heard it? I 
just bought it on my way here.

Bateman stares at the CD - stunned, terrified.BATEMANNever. I mean...I don't really like...
singers.KIMBALLNot a big music fan, eh?BATEMANNo, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too...
black sounding. For me.KIMBALLWell, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll 
call your secretary about reservations.BATEMANI'll be there.EXT. MEAT PACKING DISTRICT/INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHTThe same street corner where Bateman found Christie before. 
The limo is kept idling as he talks to her through a 
half-opened window.CHRISTIEI'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after 
last time...BATEMANOh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.CHRISTIEI don't think so.

He hands her a $500 bill.BATEMANJust come in the limo and talk to me for a minute. 

The driver's here, you'll be safe.

Christie gets in hesitantly.BATEMANNothing like last time, promise.CHRISTIEAlright.

He pours her a shot of vodka and makes her drink it.BATEMAN(Chatting as if they were at a cocktail party) 
So, you're looking great, how have you been?CHRISTIE(A little confused) 
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.BATEMAN(Mock shock) 
Really?CHRISTIEMy friend told me I should maybe even get a 
lawyer.BATEMANOh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.

He writes her a check for $I ,000 to cash and hands it to 
her. She snatches the check out of his hand and gets 
quickly out of the limo, walking hurriedly down the street.BATEMANBitch.

He follows alongside her slowly in the limo, waving a huge 
wad of cash at her. She hesitates; he uses the money to 
lure her into the car. As she reluctantly gets into the 
limo, she reaches for the money.

He snatches it away.BATEMANUh uh uh. Half now, half later.

She takes the money and puts it inside her shirt.BATEMANOkay, your name is Christie. We're meeting a friend of mine, 
Elizabeth. She'll be joining us in my new apartment shortly. 
You'll like her. She's a very nice girl. Don't say anything 
about yourself. Is that clear. Christie?

Christie nods.INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHTThe living room: ELIZABETH has kicked off her shoes and flopped 
down on the couch underneath the Baselitz. Elizabeth is an 
attractive, dark-haired society girl who models occasionally. 
Christie is sitting on the couch opposite her, pretending to 
examine a CD.ELIZABETHYou look really familiar. Did you you go to Dalton?

Christie shakes her head.

The kitchen: Bateman is grinding up tabs of Ecstasy and 
putting them in a bottle of wine. In the living room, Elizabeth 
is still staring at Christie as if she came from Mars.ELIZABETHI think I met you at Au Bar, didn't I ? With Spicey?

Christie looks blank.ELIZABETHWell, maybe not with Spicey but it was definitely at Au Bar.

Christie still blank.ELIZABETHYou know, Au Bar?

Christie shakes her head.ELIZABETHAnyway, Au Bar sucks now, it's terrible. I went to a birth
day party there for Malcolm Forbes. Oh my God, please.

Bateman enters carrying the bottle of wine and two glasses.
Christie, who seems frightened, sips her wine and stares at 
the floor. There is an awkward silence.CHRISTIEThis is nicer than your other apartment.BATEMAN(Offended that she prefers Owen's apartment) 
It's not that nice.

Silence.CHRISTIEWhere did you two meet?ELIZABETHOh God! I met him at, oh God, the Kentucky Derby in '86-no, 
'87, and...
(Turning to Patrick) 
You were hanging out with that bimbo Allison Poole. 
(Sarcastically) 
Hot number.BATEMANWhat do you mean, she was a hot number.ELIZABETHIf you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob. 
(To Christie) 
Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need
I say more?...What do you do?

A long silence. Christie reddens and stares at the floor.BATEMANShe's my...cousin.ELIZABETH(Skeptically) 
Uh huh?BATEMANShe's from...France.

A pause. Elizabeth looks at Bateman dubiously.ELIZABETHWhere's your phone? I've got to call Harley.

Bateman hands her a cordless phone. She dials, and stares 
At Christie while she waits for someone to answer.ELIZABETHWhere do you summer? Southampton?

Christie looks at Bateman and then back at Elizabeth.CHRISTIENo.ELIZABETH(Listening to the receiver) 
Oh God, it's his machine.BATEMANElizabeth, it's three in the morning.ELIZABETHHe's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.BATEMANDon't tell him you're here.ELIZABETHWhy would I?

Bateman has poured her another glass of wine. She downs the
whole glass, making a face.ELIZABETHThis tastes weird. 
(She examines the label and shrugs)
Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway 
you'd like. I'm at-BATEMAN(Whispering) 
You're at Paul Owen s.ELIZABETHWho?BATEMAN(Whispering) 
Paul Owen.ELIZABETHI want the number, idiot. 
(She waves him away and continues into the reciever) 
Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I 
don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my 
hairdresser on you.

She hangs up.ELIZABETHDid you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce 
& Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?BATEMANNo.ELIZABETHDo you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.

Bateman sits next to Elizabeth on the couch and pours her 
another glass of the drugged wine.BATEMANListen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. 
What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.ELIZABETH(Laughing) 
Patrick, you re a lunatic.BATEMANCome on. Don't you find Christie attractive?ELIZABETHLet's not get lewd. 
(Flirty) 
I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.BATEMANCome on. I think it would be a turn-on.ELIZABETH(To Christie) 
Does he do this all the time?

Christie shrugs.BATEMANChristie, you're not drinking your wine.

Christie looks at her wine and gingerly takes a sip.BATEMAN(To Elizabeth) 
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?ELIZABETHNo! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?BATEMANWell, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.ELIZABETHThose are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me 
feel weird.LATER:Elizabeth is now writhing around on the couch and making 
out with Christie. Bateman holds up a Whitney Houston CD, 
showing them the picture of Whitney on the cover.BATEMANDid you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP 
called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles 
on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps 
across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's 
mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album 
on a first listening.ELIZABETHYou actually listen to Whitney Houston? You 
actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?

She giggles, rolling off the sofa onto the floor.BATEMAN(Ignoring her) 
It's hard to choose a favorite track 
among so many great ones, but "The Greatest Love of All" 
is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written about 
self-preservation and dignity. It's universal message 
crosses all boundaries, and instills one with the hope 
that it's not too late to better ourselves. to act kinder. 
Since, Elizabeth, it's impossible in the world we live in 
to empathize with others, we can always empathize with 
ourselves.

As he speaks, he opens the case and carefully places the CD 
in the player, admiring its pristine silver surface, and 
watches it slide into the machine.BATEMANIt's an important message, crucial, really, and it's 
beautifully stated on the album.INT. BEDROOM - LATERAN OUT-OF-FOCUS HOME VIDEO SHOT of Elizabeth, Christie and 
Bateman in the throes of sex, in the master bedroom.

CUT BACK TO WIDE SHOT of the bedroom, partially blocked by 
the video camera in the foreground. Their bodies are an 
incoherent tangle of arms and legs. The only sounds are 
moans, heavy breathing and the slapping of flesh against 
flesh. CLOSE ON Christie's head and shoulders. Her eyes are 
shut as she grimly concentrates on giving a good professional 
performance, turning her head every so often to check the 
progress of her partners.

OFFSCREEN WE HEAR Elizabeth panting in genuine pleasure, 
moaning loudly. Her voice gets louder and louder and then 
shifts to actual pain.

Bateman rises up off the bed, suddenly appearing behind 
Christie. There is blood on his face.

Christie turns her head and sees him. She screams and leaps 
off the bed, running out of the room. She slams the 
mirrored door behind her, and as it swings shut for a split 
second we see Elizabeth writhing in pain on the bed.

We follow Christie out of the room, panicking, screaming.

Christie runs down a darkened hallway, frantically opening 
doors, looking for an escape.

She hears the SOUND OF A CHAINSAW coming from the bedroom.

She opens a closet. The closet lights up as she opens the 
door and sees two dead, women hanging inside. She screams, 
then claps a hand over her mouth. She stops and listens. THEDISTANT SOUND OF THE CHAINSAW.She backs away slowly, into another dark room, lit only by 
the light from a television set. Through the darkness she 
sees a head on the top of the TV and starts to whimper.

She runs toward the nearest door. Finding herself in the 
main hallway, she begins to jog toward the front door, then 
runs.

Bateman appears from nowhere, holding the chainsaw, 
spattered with blood.

Christie screams and changes direction. Bateman leaps at 
her, bellowing.

They run through the bedroom and into the bathroom. 
Christie trips over Elizabeth's body, which is half in the 
bathtub.

Both are slipping on the floor, which is slick with blood.

Christie falls, tries to get up. Bateman grabs her leg. He 
tries to bite it.

She kicks him in the face and gets up, running toward the 
front door.

He runs after her.BATEMANNot the face, you bitch. Not the fucking face, you 
piece of bitch trash!

Christie, screaming, makes it out the front door.

Bateman runs after her.

She runs down the hall screaming and banging on doors.

She moves to the elevator, pounding hysterically on the 
buttons. She sees the stairwell and runs for it.

Bateman sees this and runs after her, revving the chainsaw.

She runs down the stairs, Bateman two flights behind her. 
He stops, leans over the railing to look at her, then aims 
the chainsaw at her and drops it.

Christie SCREAMS OFFSCREEN, then is suddenly silent.

FROM BATEMAN'S POV we see Christie's body sprawled facedown 
at the bottom of the stairwell. The chainsaw sticks out of 
her back like a sword.INT. CRAYONS - EARLY EVENINGAn insanely expensive restaurant with a childhood motif: paper 
tablecloths and jars of crayons for drawing, lots of primary 
colors, and a goldfish bowl on each table.

Bateman is at a table with Evelyn. They are both drawing on 
the tablecloth. Bateman is drawing Christie with the 
chainsaw in her back.EVELYNI want a firm commitment.BATEMANI think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.

Evelyn waves to a couple across the room.EVELYN(Distracted) 
Why? What's wrong?BATEMAN(Speaking very carefully, measuring each word) 
My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale 
cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill 
my needs.

The woman across the room holds up her hand, displaying a
new bracelet. Evelyn smiles and nods approvingly.BATEMANWe need to talk.EVELYNTalk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk 
about?BATEMANIt's over, Evelyn. It's all overEVELYN(Motioning to the waiter for water) 
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just 
avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?BATEMANI'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This 
is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.EVELYNBut your friends are my friends. My friends are your 
friends. I don't think it would work. 
(Reaching over to dab his face with a napkin) 
You have a little something on your upper lip.BATEMAN(Brushing her hand away) 
I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about 
that. You can have them.

Evelyn stares at him, suspicious and bewildered, a 
realization dawning.EVELYNYou're really serious, aren't you?BATEMANYes, I am.EVELYNBut what about the past? Our past?BATEMANWe never really shared one.EVELYNYou're inhuman.BATEMANI'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry. 
(He pauses, as if searching for the right words) 
You're just not terribly important to me.

Evelyn begins to cry.EVELYNNo, no, no.BATEMANI know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.

She reaches desperately across the table and takes his 
hand. Bateman pulls his hand away.EVELYN(Sobbing) 
What do you want me to do, what is it you want?

The occupants of nearby tables begin to stare. Bateman is
becoming increasingly agitated and embarrassed.BATEMAN(Looking uncomfortably around the room) 
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making 
this scene right now.EVELYNOh God, I can't believe this.BATEMANI'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.

Evelyn makes an effort to compose herself. She blots the 
tears so they will not affect her make-up.EVELYN(Surprisingly calm) 
Where are you going?BATEMANI'm just leaving.EVELYNBut where?BATEMANI have to return some videotapes.

He rushes out of the room.EXT. TRIBECA STREET - EVENINGBateman wanders into misty Tribeca streets, sees a stray cat.BATEMANHere kitty, kitty.

The small mangy cat rubs against him. He picks it up and 
walks toward an ATM, holding the cat. He puts his card in 
the machine. The screen reads: FEED ME A STRAY CAT.
Bateman begins to attempt to shove the kitten into the 
deposit slot with some difficulty. The kitten squeals. He 
takes a gun from out of his pocket and points it at the 
kitten. He doesn't notice the woman waiting behind him.WOMANOh my God! Stop that! What are you doing?

Bateman wheels around and shoots her. She falls screaming 
to the floor.

Responding to the gunshot, A POLICE CAR SIREN WAILS in the 
distance. Bateman breaks into a run. The police car 
screeches after him.COP CAR (O.S.)HALT STOP. PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPON.Bateman ducks down an alley.EXT. ALLEY - NIGHTA COP rushes toward him, seemingly from 
out of nowhere, and tackles him, trying to get the gun away 
from him.

Bateman manages to shoot the cop in the face while both of 
them have their hands on the gun, then shoots him again. He 
reloads the gun. The sound of more COP CARS arriving.

He runs out of the alley.EXT. STREET - NIGHTAs he reaches the street, he finds A PHALANX OF POLICE CARS
approaching.COP CARHalt. Put down your weapon.

The cops leap out and fire a warning shot in the air. 
Bateman shoots at them. The police return fire.

Bateman ducks down behind a parked car and continues
shooting wildly. A bullet hits the gas tank of one of the 
police cars. It catches fire and explodes. The flames light 
up the scene, illuminating the bodies of policemen both living 
and dead.

NEW ANGLE: Bateman flees from the scene. The camera follows 
him as he runs along a row of Porsches, trying to open each 
one, setting off a cacophony of CAR ALARMS.
THE SOUND OF POLICE SIRENS draws near.

NEW ANGLE: He runs, panting, until he ends up in front of a 
tail, brilliantly lit office building. As he approaches, 
the lights in the building are going off floor by floor.INT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHTHe rushes into the lobby, running for the elevator.NIGHT WATCHMANBurning the midnight oil, Mr. Smith? You 
forgot to sign in.

Bateman wheels around and shoots him. He runs toward the 
revolving doors. As he swings around in the doors, he 
notices a JANITOR who has witnessed the shooting. He 
revolves back into the lobby and shoots the janitor.NEW ANGLE:He runs out of the building and across the 
street to an identical office building, the one that houses 
Pierce & Pierce.INT. PIERCE & PIERCE LOBBY - NIGHTBateman nods at the Pierce & Pierce NIGHT WATCHMAN and signs 
in. He breathes a sigh of relief as the elevator doors close 
behind him.INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHTBateman stands looking out 
through the floor-length windows at a panoramic night view 
of the city and the river.

Below him he sees a SWAT TEAM swarming over the roof of the 
opposite building. There are ambulances standing by, flares 
everywhere, distant sirens.

Suddenly, THE SOUND OF A HELICOPTER draws near. Frightened, 
he drops to the floor behind his desk.

Helicopter searchlights scan the building, illuminating 
Bateman's office for a few moments with a blaze of light.

He is crouched in one corner, half-sobbing, talking into 
the phone, as the searchlight keeps circling.BATEMANHarold, it's Bateman. Patrick Bateman. You're my 
lawyer so I think you should know-I've killed a lot of 
people. Some escort girls, in an apartment uptown, some 
homeless people, maybe five or ten, an NYU girl I met in 
Central Park. I left her in a parking lot, near Dunkin' 
Donuts. I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend, with a nail 
gun. and a man, some old faggot with a dog. Last week I 
killed another girl with a chainsaw-I had to, she almost 
got away There was someone else there, maybe a model, I 
can't remember but she's dead too. And Paul Owen. I killed 
Paul Owen with an ax, in the face. His body is dissolving 
in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen. I don't want to leave anything 
out here...I guess I've killed 20 people, maybe 40-I have tapes 
of a lot of it. Some of the girls have seen the tapes, I even...
well, I ate some of their brains and I tried to cook a little. 
Tonight I just, well, I had to kill a lot of people and I'm not 
sure I 'm going to get away with it this time-I mean I guess 
I'm a pretty sick guy. So-if you get hack tomorrow, I may show 
up at Harry's Bar, so, you know, keep your eyes open.

Bateman hangs up the phone. The helicopter searchlight 
circles back, briefly illuminating the room. The camera rises 
up over Bateman huddled in the corner, staring blankly at the 
sky.INT. SMITH AND WOLLENSKY RESTAURANT - DAYKIMBALL and Bateman are sitting at a corner table.KIMBALL(Very surprised) 
No hash browns?BATEMANNot in the mood, I guess.KIMBALLBut...everyone orders the hash browns here. I 
mean- it's-have you been here before?BATEMAN(Deliberately nonchalant) 
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not...
ordering them.KIMBALL(Looking at him like he's nuts) 
Suit yourself, I guess.

Pause.KIMBALLSo, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on 
what you did?BATEMANI'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some 
sorbet?KIMBALLI think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.BATEMANBut how? Where do you place Paul that night?KIMBALLAccording to his date book, and this was verified by his 
secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.BATEMANAnd?KIMBALLI've questioned him.BATEMANMarcus?KIMBALLYes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't 
be sure.BATEMANBut Marcus denied it?KIMBALLYes.BATEMANWell, does Marcus have an alibi?KIMBALLYes.

A pause.BATEMANHe does? You're sure?KIMBALL(smiling)
I checked it out. It's clean.BATEMANOh.
KIMBALL Now where were you? 
(He laughs)BATEMAN(Laughing with him) 
Where was Marcus?KIMBALLHe wasn't with Paul 
Owen.BATEMANSo who was he with?KIMBALLHe was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, 
Harry Newman, George Butner and � 
(He pauses, Then looks up) 
- you.

A moment of stunned silence.BATEMANOh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen 
to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner 
with Victoria...the following night.KIMBALLPersonally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for 
a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. 
Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or 
later. 
(A pause) 
I mean, to think that one of his friends 
killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too 
ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick? 

McDermott stops by the table. 

McDERMOTT 
KIMBALL! How's the investigation? 
Talking to Bateman? Don't believe a word he says. 
(Laughs uproariously slapping him on the back) 
Bateman, what's wrong with ,you? 

Bateman looks at him in silence, 
panicking. 

McDERMOTT 
You can't eat at Smith and Wollensky 
without ordering the hash browns. Jesus, Bateman, you're a 
raving maniac. Been at Pierce & Pierce too long. 
(He wanders off muttering) 
No fucking hash browns...INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAYBateman walks into the lobby of Paul Owen's building. He 
has a surgical mask in one hand.DOORMANWhat can I do for you, sir?BATEMAN20B.DOORMANOf course. Mrs. Wolfe is up there right now.BATEMANMrs. Wolfe?DOORMANThe real estate agent? You do have an appointment,
don't you?

Bateman steps out of the elevator and walks cautiously down
the hallway. Owen's door is open. The apartment is freshly 
painted and has been immaculately redecorated in English 
country-house style: overstuffed sofas, lots of chintz. There 
are flowers everywhere, and a YOUNG YUPPIE COUPLE stands 
admiring the place talkingto the realtor, MRS. WOLFE. Bateman 
wanders down the hallway, looking for familiar signs. He stops 
at the closet where we last saw two dead girls hanging. He 
opens the door and the light switches on, but it is empty. Mrs. 
Wolfe approaches, smiling.MRS. WOLFEAre you my two o'clock?BATEMANNo.

Mrs. Wolfe eyes him strangely, then looks down at the 
surgical mash clutched in his hand. Her expression changes.MRS. WOLFECan I help you?BATEMANI'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.

She stares at him impassively.BATEMANDoesn't he live here?MRS. WOLFENo, he doesn't.BATEMANAre you sure?MRS. WOLFEYou saw the ad in the Times?BATEMANNo. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But...
doesn't Paul Owen still live here?MRS. WOLFEThere was no ad in the Times.

Bateman is shaking as they continue to stare at each other.MRS. WOLFEI think you should go now.BATEMANBut I think...I want to know what happened 
here.MRS. WOLFEDon't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.

Bateman backs away slowly.MRS. WOLFEDon't come back.BATEMANI won't...don't worry.

Mrs. Wolfe glares at him as he walks down the hall, 
rattled, and gets into the elevator.EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAYBateman enters the revolving 
door of an office building, panicking and breathing 
heavily. He is sweating, his hair is wild, and he looks 
deranged. He goes around the revolving door twice and comes 
out onto the street again, where he bumps smack into a GUY 
just like him.GUYHey, Kinsley.

Bateman looks up at him wild-eyed.GUYSee you at Fluties, okay?

The guy walks away, utterly unfazed. Bateman wanders down 
the street, banging his briefcase against walls, garbage 
cans, etc.EXT. MIDTOWN PHONE BOOTH - DAYBateman searches his pockets 
for pills. He finds three different pills and swallows 
them. He's sweating, and takes his jacket off to wipe his 
face, dialing a number.JEAN (O.S.)Patrick Bateman's office.BATEMANJean? Hello? Jean?JEAN (O.S.)Patrick? Is that you?BATEMANHello? Jean, I need help!JEAN (O.S.)Where are you?BATEMANJean-I'm not-JEAN (O.S.)Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and 
David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.BATEMANOh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?JEAN (O.S.)Patrick? I can't hear you.BATEMANWhat are I doing?JEAN (O.S.)Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?BATEMANI don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.

Pause.BATEMAN...to the office this afternoon.JEAN (O.S.)Why?BATEMAN(Screaming) 
Just...say...no!JEAN (O.S.)What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?BATEMANStop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!

He hangs up. He throws the Walkman which is around his neck 
into a nearby trash can, and wipes his face with his 
jacket.INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE- SAME DAYJean sits at Bateman's desk. She looks around, and then opens 
his desk drawer and tentatively begins to search through it.INT. HARRY'S BAR - EVENINGBateman comes into the bar, a little cleaned up from the 
previous scene (he's smoothed his hair), but still panicking 
and disheveled. He spots his friends in a corner, sits down, 
still breathing heavily.

Price is on his cell-phone, trying to get reservations.

McDERMOTT 
Bateman, you're looking a little wild-eyed rough 
day at the office?

They all laugh.

McDERMOTT 
Hey, look-Price is back. And he's drinking 
Perrier. He s a changed man. Except...he still can't 
get a reservation to save his life.

Bateman sits down silently.

McDERMOTT 
Why don't you try I 50 Wooster? Just fucking call them.BATEMAN(On automatic) 
I'm not going anywhere unless we 
have a reservation.

VAN PATTEN Le Cirque, Flamingo East, Oyster Bar, come on, 
faggots-just get a res.PRICEKeep your shirt on. Maybe lose the suspenders.

Bateman spots HAROLD CARNES at the bar, tenses.BATEMAN(He downs his drink) 
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back.
He approaches Carnes cautiously.CARNESFace it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the 
end of the '90s.

Bateman approaches, trying to act casual.BATEMANShut up, Carnes, they will not.

Carnes is surprised, turns around, looks vaguely confused.BATEMANSo, Harold, did you get my message?

Carnes lights a cigarette, stalling. Then laughs.CARNESJesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, 
wasn't it?BATEMAN(Waving smoke out of his face) 
Yes, naturally.CARNESBateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s 
fabulous. That's rich...

PauseCARNESIt was a pretty long message, wasn't it?BATEMANWhat exactly do you mean?CARNESThe message you left.

Carnes is distracted, waving at people.CARNESBy the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still 
seeing her, right?BATEMANBut wait, Harold, what do you mean?

Carnes isn't really listening.CARNESExcuse me. Nothing. Good to see you. Is that Edward Towers?

He turns to go.BATEMANCarnes? Wait.CARNES(Sighing) 
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. 
But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, 
such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully 
appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said 
Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's 
have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.BATEMANWhat are you talking about? Bateman is what?CARNESOh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let 
alone...what was it you said he did to her?

Carnes looks around the club, raises his glass to a passing 
couple. He laughs politely.CARNESNow, if you'll excuse me, I really must...BATEMAN(Desperate, shouting) 
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really 
comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. 
I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. 
I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your 
machine was true.CARNESExcuse me. I really must he going.BATEMANNo! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm 
Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! 
Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.

Carnes stares at him in confusion and annoyance.BATEMANNow, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed 
Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearerCARNESBut that's simply not possible. And I don't find 
this funny anymore.BATEMANIt never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?CARNES(Eyeing Bateman worriedly)
It's just not.BATEMANWhy not, you stupid bastard?

Carnes stares at him.CARNESBecause I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in 
London...just ten days ago.BATEMANNo, you...didn't?CARNESNow, if you'll excuse me.

Bateman returns back to his friends' table, in a daze.
They are all looking at the television, where Ronald 
Reagan is giving a speech about Iran Contra. They are 
halfheartedly arguing about whether or not he's 
lying.PRICEHow can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?VAN PATTENWhat shit? Now where do we have reservations at? 
I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have 
reservations somewhere.PRICE(To Bateman) 
I don't believe it. He looks so...normal. He seems so...
out of it. So...undangerous.

McDERMOTT 
He is totally harmless you geek. Was totally harmless.
Just like you are totally harmless. But he did do all that 
shit and you have failed lo get us into I 50, so, you know, 
what can I say?PRICEI just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that 
way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so 
fucking, I don't know, cool about it?VAN PATTENSome guys are just born cool, I guess.

Bateman laughs at this. Price shoots him a look.PRICEAnd Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?BATEMANI'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'.VAN PATTEN(To Price) Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. 
Working for UNICEF now?

McDERMOTT 
Do you want another Perrier Timothy? Some seltzer water?PRICEOh brother look-he presents himself as a harmless 
Old codger. But inside...

Pause.PRICEBut inside...

The SOUNDS OF THE BAR FADE AWAY and we hear Bateman's thoughts:BATEMAN (V.O.)But inside doesn't matter...THE SOUNDS OF THE BAR RETURN.McDERMOTT 
(Bored)
Inside? Yes, inside? Believe it or not, Price we're actually 
listening to you.PRICEBateman? Come on, what do you think? 

Bateman looks up and smiles at Price. Then shrugs.BATEMANWhatever.

The conversation breaks up as Van Patten takes out his phone.VAN PATTENWhose moronic idea was it to drink dry beers? I need a Scotch.

The sounds of the bar fade down. The following voiceover runs 
over images of Bateman and his friends ordering drinks, talking 
on portable phones, talking, laughing - combined with images of 
other very similar young men at other tables drinking, talking 
on portable phones, talking, laughing,BATEMAN (V.O.)There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with 
the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, 
all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward 
it, I have now surpassed...INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - DAYJean is alone in Bateman's office, looking through his diary. 
We see the pages that she is looking at. They are filled with 
doodles of mutilated women and their names...Jean looks lost 
and frightened, and begins to cry.BATEMAN (V.O.)My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better 
world for anyone. I fact I want my pain to be inflicted on 
others. I want no escape.INT. HARRY'S BAR - EARLY EVENINGAs the film ends the camera moves CLOSE on Bateman. He is 
leaning back in his leather armchair, drinking a double Scotch, 
his eyes blank.BATEMAN (V.O.)But even after admitting this, there is no catharsis. I gain no 
deeper knowledge about myself, no new knowledge can be extracted 
from my telling. There has been no reason for me to tell you any 
of this. This confession has meant nothing...

The camera moves up to a sign on the wall behind him:"THIS IS NOT AN EXIT."CREDITS ROLL
