            throwing...wait, wait, wait, he's
            throwing them away, he's throwing
            the leads away.  All that I'm
            saying, that you're wasting leads.
            I don't want to tell you your job.
            All that I'm saying, things get
            set, I know they do, you get a
            certain mindset... A guy gets a

            Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I

            what it does, that's all it's doing.
            Streaks.  I pray it misses you.

            him.  The Seville...?  He came in,
            "You bought that for me Shelly."
            Out of what?  Cold calling.  Nothing.
            Sixty-five, when we were there,
            with Glen Ross Farms?  You call 'em
            downtown.  What was that?  Luck?
            That was "luck"?  Bullshit, John.
            You're burning my ass, I can't get
            a fucking lead...you think that was
            luck.  My stats for those years?
            Bullshit...over that period of
            time...?  Bullshit.  It wasn't luck.
            It was skill.  You want to throw

            those leads...LEVENEMarshal the leads...marshal the
            leads?  What the fuck, what bus did
            you get off of, we're here to
            fucking sell.  Fuck marshaling the
            leads.  What the fuck talk is that?
            What the fuck talk is that?  Where
            did you learn that?  In school?

            mark?  With dreck...?  That's
            nonsense.  Explain this to me.
            'Cause it's a waste, and it's a
            stupid waste.  I want to tell you
            something...WILLIAMSONYou know what those leads cost?LEVENEThe premium leads.  Yes.  I know
            what they cost.  John.  Because I,
            I generated the dollar revenue
