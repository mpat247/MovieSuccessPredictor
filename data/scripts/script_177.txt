                 Emily V. Gordon & Kumail Nanjiani1OVER BLACK.We hear audience laughter.ANDY DODD (V.O.)Give it up for my man, Mr. Kumail
              Nanjiani!KUMAIL (V.O.)Hello. I grew up in Pakistan. And people
              are always asking me, what was that like?
              Really not that different from here. I
              mean we played cricket, which is just a
              spicier version of baseball. And we
              prayed a lot. Well not a lot, just five
              times a day. And we marry someone our
              parents find for us. Arranged marriage,
              you know. For me, it was probably that we
              got episodes of the A-Team a little bit
              later. And by a little bit later, I mean
              we just got episode two. But other than
              that, it was exactly the same.A CREDIT SEQUENCE PLAYS.Kumail drives an Uber around Chicago with VARIOUS
    PASSENGERS in the backseat.INT. TRIPLE DOOR - PRESENT DAY - NIGHTKumail walks into the comedy club as MARY is doing a set
    on stage. CHRIS intercepts Kumail as he walks backstage.CHRISThere's no bad crowds dude. Only bad
              comedians.KUMAILYou complain about the crowd like all
              the time.CHRISYeah, but that's when they're really bad.KUMAILSo like ninety percent of the time,
              they're really bad?2CHRISWill you just watch and give me notes
              tonight? If we both give each other
              notes, I think it would be helpful.KUMAILYour notes are just to add more "fucks"
              into the bit.CHRISFuck's a funny word. Soft on the top and
              it's hard on the end.

    Mary walks off the stage and sits on the couch next toCJ.MARYThat was truly horrible.KUMAILHey, that was great.MARYNo, he didn't even crack a smile. I
              thought I was gonna puke.CHRISWho?MARYBob Dalavan.CHRISWho's Bob Dalaban?CJBob Dalavan - works for the Montreal
              Comedy Festival, you fuckin' doof.
              Don't you want to get noticed? Move to
              LA? Hang out with Elijah Wood and shit.

    Dodd jumps up on stage.DODD (O.S.)Now before I bring up the next guy, you
              guys know tonight is Jell-o Shot
              Tuesday! Whooo!! And we all know what
              happens after eight Jell-o shots. We
              urinate all over ourselves and puke.
              Okay, so I'm going to bring up the next
              comic. You know this man.

              Give it up for Mister Chris Jones!


    Chris walks on stage.KUMAILHe's like if a serial killer fucked an
              inspirational speaker.CJHe's like Daniel Day Lewis except he
              sucks.CHRISJust bought a laser printer. Printed
              out like six lasers so far.

    CJ, Kumail, and Mary watching Chris' set. Andy Dodd
    saunters backstage.KUMAILHey Dodd. Dalavan's in the crowd
              tonight. Could I do ten?DODDNo. Five minutes. You put out chairs,
              you get five minutes. You know the
              deal.KUMAILC'mon man. I'll double it up next time.4DODDNo.

    Dodd walks back into the bathroom.KUMAILWhat are you gonna do in there?DODDI'm making up next week's schedule.KUMAILOkay. Cool.INT. TRIPLE DOOR - LATERCJ is on stage crushing it. Kumail and Mary watch from
    the wings.CJI was in bed with my girlfriend and I was
              trying to mansplain to her that, you
              know, we are on one little rock orbiting
              a star in a galaxy of a billion stars in
              a universe full of a billion galaxies, so
              I forgot your birthday. Who gives a shit?
              You are cosmically over reacting to this.
              Honestly you are being super selfish.
              You're right, but you're selfish.

    Kumail looks out at the crowd. Dalavan enjoys CJ's set.INT. TRIPLE DOOR - LATERKumail puts a RECORDER on his stool, presses RECORD and
    starts his set.KUMAILHey! Have you guys heard of this new drug
              cocktail called cheese? I saw these news
              reports so I looked up what cheese is and
              cheese is a mixture. Cheese is Tylenol PM
              and heroin. So really, it's heroin.
              Heroin's doing the heavy lifting. Just do
              the heroin, it's very powerful. You
              already have heroin.

    Kumail looks to see if Bob Dalavan is laughing. He's not
    there. He's in the back talking to CJ. Fuck.5KUMAIL (CONT'D)(pushing through)
             Is Pakistan in the house?!

    O.S. A WOMAN "Woo-hoos!" Kumail looks out at the crowd
    and sees EMILY, late 20's, white with a streak of blue
    in her hair. She sits at a table with a few friends.KUMAIL (CONT'D)You're not from Pakistan. I would have
             noticed you.

    She smiles.

    Crowded bar scene after the show. Kumail, Chris, Mary
    and CJ hang out at the bar.CHRISHe just gave you Montreal? Like you
             don't have to showcase or audition or
             anything?CJIt was too easy. Like I wanted to
             struggle. I wanted a story to be able
             to tell on talk shows and instead,
             like, you guys don't know how hard it
             is not to struggle. It's a struggle
             succeeding effortlessly.MARYDid he say anything about me?CJSure.CHRISWhat about me?CJBoth of you. He said, those guys
             performed...MARYI truly hate you, actually.CHRISWe all hate you.

    Kumail walks over to Emily and her friend JESSIE, talks
    loud over the music.KUMAILHi.6EMILYHi.KUMAILUm, my name is Kumail.EMILYYeah. We know.JESSIEWe saw you perform.KUMAILYeah. Now that the niceties are out of
              the way, I have to tell you that when
              you yelled at me, it threw me off. You
              really shouldn't heckle comedians. It's
              so rude.EMILYI didn't heckle you. I just woo-hooed
              you. It was supportive.KUMAILOkay, that's a common misconception.
              Yelling anything at a comedian is
              considered heckling. Heckling doesn't
              have to be negative.EMILYSo if I yelled out "You're amazing in
              bed," that would be a heckle?KUMAILYeah. It'd be an accurate heckle.JESSIEWow. Goodbye!

    Jessie walks away.EMILYDon't go! You scared my friend off now.KUMAILWhat's your name?EMILYEmily.

    Kumail writes Emily's name in Urdu on a napkin.7KUMAILI want to show you something, Emily.
              This is your name in Urdu.

    Emily picks up the napkin, looks at it.EMILYWhoa. Does this move work?KUMAILI've had some minor success with it.EMILYBullshit.INT. TRIPLE DOOR BAR - LATEREmily and Kumail are still at the bar.KUMAILSo you came to a comedy show with your
              friends?EMILYYeah, we're all grad students at U ofC.KUMAILWhat are you studying at grad school?EMILYI study psychology. I'm going to be a
              therapist.KUMAILOh so you're gonna sit on a couch and
              ask people, "how did that make you
              feel?"EMILYEventually. Right now I'm doing field
              work with a group of guys convicted of
              domestic violence.KUMAILJesus.EMILYCheers to that.8KUMAILOh wow. No, don't cheers to that. To
              you becoming a therapist.EMILYGreat. To me getting my masters. We'll
              start there and then we'll go to the
              rest of it.INT. KUMAIL'S APARTMENT - LATERKumail and Emily walk in. It's a typical bachelor pad
    boy house. Milk crates for furniture, mess everywhere,
    no art on the walls. Chris is sitting on the couch
    watching TV.KUMAILSo my roommate Chris is probably on the
              couch. He's going to try and start a
              conversation. So no matter what- do not
              engage. Okay? Let's go.CHRISHi!

    Emily and Kumail walk by Chris avoiding eye contact.
    Kumail closes the bedroom door behind him.CHRIS (CONT'D)Good for him.INT. KUMAIL'S BEDROOM- CONTINUOUSKumail's bed is an inflatable air mattress. There are
    clothes everywhere.KUMAILDo you want to watch a movie?EMILYSure. Should I just, put my stuff down?
              Or...KUMAILYeah, I would say it's safe. You know
              what, go for that area. I cleaned that
              earlier this year.

    Kumail points to a corner of his room covered in dirty
    clothes.9EMILYShould I take my shoes off or is this a
              shoes on bed?KUMAILNo, it's a shoes off bed. I have strict
              rules.

    Emily crawls onto the air mattress.EMILYOh wow. That's totally an inflated
              mattress.KUMAILYeah. Did you think it would be a flat
              inflatable mattress?EMILYI did think it might be an actual
              mattress.KUMAILWell air mattresses are actual
              mattresses. You're being bigoted towards
              air based comfort items.

    Kumail picks up the remote and turns on the TV. Night of
    the Living Dead is playing.KUMAIL (CONT'D)Night of The Living Dead?EMILYSure, I haven't ever seen that movie.KUMAILOkay, so basically the dead start rising.
              And the good guys, um...

    They eye each other flirtatiously. Laugh. Lean in and
    kiss.INT. KUMAIL'S LIVING ROOMChris hits the Siri button on his iPhone.CHRISText Lauren. You up girl?SIRIWhat do you want to say to Warren?10CHRISAh, no. Fuck.

     Chris hits the Siri button again.SIRIWhat do you want to say to-CHRISYou up? Period. Send.SIRIThat may be beyond my abilities at the
               moment.CHRISFuck.INT. KUMAIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHTKumail and Emily post-coital.EMILYWhat are these scars?KUMAILOh, they're a smallpox vaccination.EMILYI thought only old people had those.KUMAILWell I'm from Pakistan. We're still
               fighting some battles you guys have
               already won.EMILYWhat were you like in high school? Were
               you like, super funny? Were you really
               smart?KUMAILI was very shy. They called me
               chashmullee.EMILYWhat is that?KUMAILIt roughly translates to "dweeb." I'll
               show you a picture.11Kumail flips through his phone and produces his old high
     school photo, shows it to her.EMILYOf you in high school? Oh my god!KUMAILBoom.EMILYNo.KUMAILAnd I'm thinking I'm killing it right
              now.EMILYWhat inspired this hair cut?KUMAILHugh Grant.EMILYOh no. And you're so serious.KUMAILI read in an interview with Hugh Grant,
              he said he doesn't smile because it
              makes his face look fat. So I didn't
              smile in pictures for many years. What
              were you like in high school? Were you
              voted... Most Sexy?EMILYNo. I was voted "Most Noticeable."KUMAILThat's good.EMILYNo. It's really not good. I had acne,
              and I was a Goth and I had this
              terrible perm. The kids called me
              Beetlejuice. I don't know why. Actually
              I do know why, it's because they
              thought I looked like Beetlejuice. I
              think I'm done with this subject. In
              fact, I think I'm gonna go home.

     Emily gets up, pulling the blanket with her to hide her
     body. Kumail holds onto it, stopping her progress.KUMAILWait we haven't even had sex again yet.12She tugs the blanket, he lets go. She dresses behind it.EMILYNo. No. I'm really not that kind of
               girl. I only have sex once on a first
               date. Plus a hand job.KUMAILWell I haven't had that yet!

     Emily laughs.EMILYYou don't get that because you made fun
               of me.KUMAILWhat is happening right now? What are you
               doing?EMILYI'm changing under this blanket.KUMAILI've seen everything. Do you remember, we
               were just having sex?EMILYYeah, but you were in the throes of
               passion then. Listen, I had a really nice
               time. Thank you very much. I'm just gonna
               call an Uber and go home.

     Emily pulls out her PHONE, calls an Uber. Kumail's phone
     makes a noise. They exchange a look.KUMAILYour driver will be ready as soon as he
               puts on his pants.EMILYWere you available for rides while we
               were fucking?KUMAILYeah, but I only looked a couple of
               times.INT. KUMAIL'S CAR - LATERKumail Ubers Emily home. Emily sits in the back.13KUMAILSo. Maybe I'll run into you at the club
     sometime and we can grab a drink?EMILYI'm not really - I know this sounds
     like a line - but I'm not really dating
     right now. I have a lot of school and
     work and just a lot on my plate.KUMAILThat's perfect because I'm not really
     dating right now either. I actually
     have a pretty strict two-day rule where
     I can't see someone more than two days
     in a row. So since we hung out for two
     days, if I were to see you again, which
     I won't because you're not dating, I'm
     not dating, I wouldn't be able to see
     you until Monday.EMILYWe haven't hung out for two days. We've
     hung out for about five hours. Just to
     like, be totally clear.KUMAILYesterday and today. Cause it's after
     midnight, today is actually tomorrow.
     Earlier tonight was yesterday. So two
     days.EMILYYou see, I don't date time nerds, so that
     really takes you off the table.KUMAILThat works out, because I am a hard
     core time nerd.EMILYYeah, I can tell.KUMAILI'm like, very strict about AM/PM
     stuff.EMILYSo wait, just to establish, what did we
     just decide?KUMAILWe decided we aren't ever going to see
     each other again.14EMILYGreat. I'm glad we're on the same page.INT. KUMAIL'S PARENTS DINING ROOM - BRUNCHKumail is eating brunch with his father, AZMAT, his

               soft.KUMAILI don't want to touch your jeans.AZMATThey're like sweatpants. You should be

               difficult. Just observe me.NAVEEDGet some Daddy Style.SHARMEENKumi, why don't you grow a beard? Not

               You know who I think should stand up is
               Malala. She has something to say.15NAVEEDMa-la-la.KUMAILShe does open mics and she crushes. Lot
     of ethnic material, which I think is a
     crutch, and that one story gets a lot of
     play, but -FATIMAYou should be on that show Saturday Night
     Live!NAVEEDSNL!KUMAILThat's a great idea. I should e-mail
     them, I don't know why I hadn't thought
     of that.AZMATYou know, I hacked into your Cousin
     Rehan's Facebook account-KUMAILYou hacked into it?AZMATYeah, they were not accepting my friend
     request so I had to hack into it and I
     discovered he and that white woman he is
     living with are having a baby -KUMAILThey're married.AZMATYeah, whatever. And then I hacked into
     Tumblr and I discovered that they named
     him Dav�. Can you imagine?KUMAILDave. It's probably Dave.ALLAh, Dave. Yes, Dave.SHARMEENVery, very, very sad. No one is going to
     visit that baby. That baby, mark my
     words, will grow up without a family.16FATIMAIt's like he's dead. Or worse.SHARMEENIt's very sad. Kumi, go pray now so we

      Kumail takes a sip of water.KUMAILSo the first time I came to America, I
                was fourteen and I was just visiting my
                uncle in New York and it just happened
                to be Thanksgiving. On my first day in
                America, my uncle took me to the Macy's
                Thanksgiving Day Parade and I was like,
                this is every day in America! As
                advertised. Every day they have a party
                celebrating Garfield. No day has lived
                up to that day. So I was lying to my
                parents, I was telling them I was gonna
                be a lawyer. And they're very
                disappointed cause they wanted me to be
                a doctor. And you guys are like, why
                didn't you just tell them that you
                wanted to be a doctor?(MORE)113KUMAIL (CONT'D)It's a lie anyway. And I'm like, well it
               has to be believable. If I told them I
               want to be a doctor, they'd be like,
               "bullshit." If I say lawyer, they're
               like, "oh, ok, that's something." Cause
               there's a strict hierarchy: doctor,
               engineer, lawyer, hundreds of jobs,
               ISIS, then comedian.

      looks out to the crowd to see Emily, beaming at him. He
      is taken aback.KUMAIL (CONT'D)(stumbling)
               Uhh. I'm sorry. It's very rude to
               heckle comedians.EMILYOh that wasn't a heckle. I just kind of
               woo-hooed you.KUMAILWell see that's a common misconception.
               Heckling doesn't have to be negative.EMILYSo if I was like, oh my god, you're
               amazing in bed! That would be a heckle?KUMAILYeah, and now you're getting more laughs
               than me, and I don't like that. Do you
               want to come up, do my job? Are you from

               don't know what your deal is.EMILYYeah, I've seen him.
