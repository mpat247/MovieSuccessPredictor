          The face belongs to RAWLEY HALE, 28. They are in...INT. GYMNASIUM, WHITEMAN AFB - DAYHale and Deakins are sparring in a ring. Other people are
          lifting weights, shooting baskets.IN THE RINGHale and Deakins circle each other. Hale is shaking cobwebs out
          of his head.DEAKINSYou know what happened there?HALEHell, I barely know what day it is.DEAKINSI set you up. I fake right, go
          left three times in a row. You
          expect it again, I take the right
          in hard. That's what boxing's all
          about. Make your opponent think
          you're gonna do one thing, then do
          another. Like Ali in Zaire, using
          the rope-a-dope on Foreman.
          (mimes rope-a-dope)
          Everyone thought Ali's arms were
          getting destroyed, when he was
          really just letting Foreman tire
          himself out. Eighth round, Ali
          starts hitting, George's got
          nothing left -- fight's over.HALEThe fact that I can't feel the
          left side of my face -- that's
          okay, right?
          Deakins laughs. Hale seizes the relaxed moment and suddenly
          launches into Deakins with a flurry of punches.THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE GYMTake notice -- the fight is getting real. They move to the ring.DEAKINSSeveral of Hale's punches land. Deakins staggers back, caught
          off guard. It looks like he might even go down.2.HALEHe cocks his arm back. He could finish Deakins off. But he
          doesn't. He drops his fist.DEAKINSSeizes the opportunity and slugs back.THE CROWDLoves it.HALE AND DEAKINSNow Deakins has the upperhand. He backs Hale around the ring.DEAKINSDon't watch my hands -- watch my
          shoulders. That's where the punch
          starts. Ready?
          Deakins hits Hale hard in the face, sending him back.THE SPECTATORSAre circling the ring, following the fighters, cheering.HALE AND DEAKINSDEAKINSYou were looking at my hands.
          Let's try it again. Ready?
          Deakins hits Hale hard. He's got Hale on the run.DEAKINSCome on. Focus. Ready?(PUNCH)My shoulders. Ready?
          Deakins fakes left, puts everything into one big uppercut. It
          connects.HALELands, dazed, blood trickling out of the corner of his mouth.DEAKINSHe's in silhouette, the lights above him.HALELooks up at Deakins, catches his breath.3.HALE AND DEAKINSDeakins offers his hand. Hale pushes it aside. Deakins ignores
          Hale, grabs him and helps him to his feet. Deakins climbs out
          of the ring between the ropes.
          Hale grabs the top rope and flips himself over, landing on his
          feet. Deakins gives Hale a look, laughs, shakes his head.INT. SHOWERSHale lets the water rinse the blood off his face.INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAYHale and Deakins are sitting on the bench between their lockers,
          getting into their flightsuits, pulling on boots. Deakins is
          smoking a cigarette. The smoke curls up into the light slanting
          down across the room from high windows.HALE'S LOCKERIs in sunlight. On the inside of his locker door are pictures
          of exotic planes -- the SR-71, a swept-wing fighter, an artist's
          rendition of the Aurora, etc.DEAKINS' LOCKEROn the shady side of the room. Nothing on the inside of his
          locker door. The locker is spare, Zen-like in its neatness.HALEHere.HALE'S HANDSlams a twenty dollar bill down on the bench.DEAKINSI can't take that.HALEOh, shut up.DEAKINSReally. I feel bad. How many times
          have we fought and how many times
          have you won?HALEJerk.DEAKINSWell, if you insist.
          Deakins grins, folds the bill and jams it into his flightsuit.4.DEAKINSYou know why I beat you?HALEBecause you've been boxing for
          twenty years and you're much
          better at it than I am?DEAKINSYou don't want it enough. You had
          me today. I was back on my heels.
          But you didn't close the door.HALEWe were just sparring.DEAKINSLife isn't sparring, Hale.HALEI think I saw that on a T-shirt.
          Deakins pulls out the twenty dollar bill; hands it back to Hale.DEAKINSHere.HALENo, that's yours.DEAKINSIf you weren't giving it
          everything you've got, then I
          don't want it.HALENo, I mean -- that's yours,
          literally. I took it out of your
          wallet when you were in the shower.
          Deakins laughs, puts the money away.EXT. WHITEMAN AIR FORCE BASE - DUSKPlanes taxiing, vehicles moving.INT. WHITEMAN MISSION BRIEFING ROOMDeakins and Hale enter to find GENERAL BOONE, 50s.DEAKINS/HALEGeneral.5.BOONEGentlemen.

          Palmdale's afraid low-level gamma
          and x-ray diffusion might screw up
          the peripherals. They asked us to
          send a couple on a run, see if

          two pilots' seats in this plane, with duplicate controls.6.But instead of the usual dials and gauges on the control panels,
          there are FOUR COMPUTER SCREENS in front of each pilot. Hale
          gets into the left seat; Deakins the right. They review
          information on their screens, flip switches.INTERCUT WITH BOMBSBeing loaded into the bomb bays. When they've been clamped into

          comes and we finally go to war
          against Utah, we are really going
          to kick ass.CUT TO:EXT. CANYONLANDS NATIONAL PARK, UTAH - NIGHTBright moonlight shows a campfire burning at the edge of an
          escarpment, the Colorado River a thousand feet below. Near the
          campfire is an Army surplus tent. Next to it, an easel holds a
          painting in progress.A PARK RANGER TRUCKDrives up, stops. The driver's door open, and out gets...A RANGERWe don't see his face in the dark. He switches on a flashlight,
          walks over and taps on the tent.RANGERPark Ranger. I'd like to talk to
          somebody about this fire.7.We hear a man and a woman -- JIM and WANDA, 60s -- wake up.JIM (O.S.)Wha--? Oh, hell.WANDA (O.S.)I'll talk to him, Jim.JIM (O.S.)Wanda, you stay put.
          Jim comes out of the tent, the ranger's light in his face.JIMI know -- no wood fires in the
          Park. It's just -- Wanda's got a
          cold and I wanted her to stay warm.RANGERSir, you see any other hikers,
          campers anywhere around here?JIMNot this time of year. What's the
          fine for something like this?RANGERYour life.
          Jim grins. But the ranger pulls out a pistol and shoots Jim,
          who falls into the fire. He then puts three shots through the
          wall of the tent. Nothing moves. The Ranger -- call him
          BAKER -- pulls out a walkie-talkie, clicks on.BAKERDone.HEADLIGHTSCome on and two Humvees roll in and four men get out. Three of
          them -- JOHNSON, a tech-whiz; LETT, gangly, grim, and NOVACEK,
          a wiry guy in a baseball cap -- start setting up what looks to
          be a high-tech missile launcher. The fourth man is...MR. PRITCHETTA neatly groomed man, 40s, with a perpetually sour attitude. He
          looks like -- and is -- a lawyer.PRITCHETT(to Baker, re: Jim inFIRE)Jesus. Do you think maybe you
          could get him out of the fire?

          with more fighter hours.DEAKINSWhat'd you say?HALEWhat could I say?DEAKINSJesus. You are such a pussy. You
          never fight for anything.
          Hale is stung. Pissed, he goes on the offensive.HALEYeah, well you know what your
          problem is?DEAKINSBecause I said what your problem
          is, you're gonna--?HALEYou fight too much.

          Right? You said it yourself --
          you should be at least Wing

          be if you didn't insist on telling
          people what they're doing wrong
          all the time.DEAKINSI'm usually right though, aren't I?

          because I wanted to fly cool
          planes. It's also for this. When
          we're up here, I feel... closer
          ... I don't know.DEAKINSTo God? Is that what you're going
          to say? That you feel closer to
          God up here?(SNORTS)Hell, Hale, with the payload we're
          carrying, we are God.
          Deakins notices something odd on his screen. He checks between
          the screen and what he can see through the windshield.DEAKINSHale, take a look out your side.
          I think our terrain following is
          off. It's got us two klicks from

          Wilkins turns away. Hale sits back, mind racing, not knowing
          what to do. He quickly grabs a pistol from the helicopter's
          weapons rack and puts it to Wilkin's neck.WILKINSMajor, put that away or say

          gun, sits back.
          Giles gets Hale's attention, then points to his own head. Hale
          doesn't understand, so Giles grabs Hale's gunhand and puts the
          gun up to his head.GILESColonel! How about this?
