          furious, hand-to-hand fighting between human SOLDIERS and
          nightmare CREATURES, their corpses now in piles to the
          horizon.
          The Dog climbs a mound of casualties. At the top, the
          Dog looks back across the battlefield. The Dog's eyes

          Even Acrisius, who fears nothing, steps back. The others
          raise their weapons.
          The Dog comes down the steps, eyes upon them, and passes

          SCREAM from within.
          Some members of the Royal Entourage look with scorn at
          their King, outraged by this double murder. Acrisius
          registers their disapproving looks and angrily turns to
          leave the promontory.
