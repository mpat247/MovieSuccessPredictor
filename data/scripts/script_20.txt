          Soldiers in a foreign war shoot an unarmed civilian at point-
          blank range; a man is set on by a frenzied crowd wielding
          clubs and machetes; a woman is necklaced while her killers
          cheer and howl.
                         
          Pull back to reveal that we are seeing one of many screens in
          a bank of monitors, all showing similar images...
                         
          Then revealing that the monitors are in a...INT. SURGICAL CHAMBER - NIGHT...surgical chamber. And watching the screens is a...
                         
          ...chimp, strapped to an operating table, with its skull
          dissected open, webbed in wires and monitoring devices,
          muzzled with a transparent guard. Alive.
                         
          Behind the surgical chamber, through the wide doorframe, we
          can see a larger laboratory beyond.INT. BRIGHT CORRIDOR - NIGHTA group of black-clad ALF Activists, all wearing balaclavas,
          move down a corridor. They carry various gear - bag, bolt
          cutters.
                         
          As they move, one Activist reaches up to a security camera
          and sprays it black with an aerosol paint can.INT. LABORATORY - NIGHTThe Activists enter the laboratory.CHIEF ACTIVISTFucking hell...
                         
          The Chief Activist takes his camera off his shoulder and
          starts taking photos.
                         
          The room is huge and long, and darkened except for specific
          pools of light. Partially illuminated are rows of cages with
          clear perspex doors. They run down either side of the room.
          In the cages are chimpanzees.2.Most are in a state of rabid agitation, banging and clawing
          against the perspex, baring teeth through foam-flecked
          mouths.
                         
          They reach the far end of the lab, where on a huge steel
          operating table they see the dissected chimp.FEMALE ACTIVISTOh God...
                         
          The dissected chimp's eyes flick to the Activists. Blood
          wells from around the exposed brain tissue.
                         
          Tears starts to roll down the Female Activist's cheeks.CHIEF ACTIVIST(to Female Activist)
           Keep your shit together. If we're
           going to get them out of here...
                         
          The Finnish Activist is checking the perspex cages.FINNISH ACTIVISTI can pop these, no problem.CHIEF ACTIVISTSo get to it.
                         
          The Finnish Activist raises his crowbar and sticks it around
          the edge of one of the doors - about to prise it open.
                         
          At the moment, the doors to the laboratory bang open.
                         
          The Activists all turn. Standing at the entrance is the
          Scientist.
                         
          A pause. The Scientist jumps to a telephone handset on the
          wall and shouts into the receiver.SCIENTISTSecurity! We have a break-in! Get
           to sector...
                         
          A hand slams down the disconnect button.SCIENTIST...nine.
                         
          The Chief Activist plucks the receiver from the Scientist's
          hands, and then rips the telephone from the wall.
                         
          A beat.3.SCIENTISTI know who you are, I know what you

          the machete-wielding crowd.SCIENTIST(desperately trying toEXPLAIN)In order to cure, you must first
           understand. Just imagine: to have

           and...FEMALE ACTIVISTThey won't bite me.
                         
          The Female Activist crouches down to face the wild eyes of
          the infected chimp behind the perspex.SCIENTISTSTOP! You have no idea!
                         
          The Scientist makes a desperate lunge towards her, but the
          Chief Activist grabs him.FEMALE ACTIVISTGood boy. You don't want to bite
           me, do you?
                         
          The Female Activist gives a final benign smile, then the
          Finnish Activist pops open the door.SCIENTISTNO!Like a bullet from a gun, the infected chimp leaps out at the
          Female Activist - and sinks its teeth into her neck. She
          reels back as the chimp claws and bites with extraordinary
          viciousness.
                         
          At the same moment, a deafening alarm begins to sound.FEMALE ACTIVIST(SHRIEKING)Get it off! Get if off!
                         
          The Finnish Activist rips the ape off and throws it on to the
          floor. The infected chimp immediately bites into the man's
          leg. He yells with pain, and tries to kick it off.5.Behind him, the Female Activist has started to scream. She
          doubles up, clutching the side of her head.FEMALE ACTIVISTI'm burning! Jesus! Help me!SCIENTISTWe have to kill her!FEMALE ACTIVISTI'm burning! I'm burning!CHIEF ACTIVISTWhat's...SCIENTISTWe have to kill her NOW!
                         
          Meanwhile, the Female Activist's cries have become an
          unwavering howl of pain - and she is joined by the Finnish
          Activist, whose hands have also flown to the side of his
          head, gripping his temples as if trying to keep his skull
          from exploding.CHIEF ACTIVISTWhat's wrong with them?
                         
          The Scientist grabs a desk-lamp base and starts running
          towards the screaming Female Activist...
                         
          ...who has ripped off her balaclava - revealing her face -
          the face of an Infected.
                         
          She turns to the Scientist.SCIENTISTOh God.
                         
          She leaps at him. He screams as they go tumbling to the
          ground.
                         
          The Chief Activist watches in immobile horror as she attacks
          the Scientist with amazing ferocity.INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHTAnother ACTIVIST makes his way down the corridor towards the

          He reaches the door to the lab, which is closed - and...
                         
          ...as he opens it, we realize the door is also soundproofed.
                         
          A wall of screaming hits him.
                         
          He stands in the doorway - stunned by the noise, and then the
          sight.
                         
          Blood, death, and his colleagues, all Infected.ACTIVISTBloody hell.
                         
          The Infected rush him.FADE TO BLACK.TITLE:28 DAYS LATERINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOONClose up of Jim, a young man in his twenties, wearing pale
          green hospital pyjamas. He has a month's beard, is
          dishevelled, and asleep.
                         
          We pull back to see that Jim is lying on a hospital bed, in a
          private room. Connected to his arms are multiple drips, a
          full row of four or five on each side of his bed. Most of the
          bags are empty.
                         
          Jim's eyes open.
                         
          He looks around with an expression of confusion. Then he sits
          up. He is weak, but he swings his legs off the bed and
          stands. The attached drips are pulled with him and clatter to
          the floor.
                         
          Jim winces, and pulls the taped needles from his arm.JIMOw...
                         
          His voice is hoarse, his mouth dry. Massaging his throat, he
          walks to the door.7.INT. COMA WARD - LATE AFTERNOONThe door to Jim's hospital room is locked. The key is on the
          floor. He picks it up and opens the door.
                         
          Jim exits into a corridor.
                         
          At the far end, a sign read: COMA WARD. There is no sign of
          life or movement.
                         
          Jim walks down the corridor. One of the doors is half-open.
          From inside, there is the sound of buzzing flies.INT. HOSPITAL WARDS - LATE AFTERNOONJim moves as quickly as he can through the hospital, still
          weak, but now driven by adrenaline.
                         
          All the wards and corridors are deserted. Medical notes and
          equipment lie strewn over the floors, trolleys are upended,
          glass partition doors are smashed. In a couple of places,
          splashes of dried blood arc up the walls.
                         
          He reaches A&E. On one wall is a row of public pay phones.
                         
          He lifts a receiver, and the line is dead. He goes down the
          line, trying them all.
                         
          In the corner of the A&E reception is a smashed soft-drinks
          machine, with a few cans collected at the base.
                         
          Jim grabs one, rips off the ring-pull and downs it in one go.
          Then he grabs another, and heads for the main doors.EXT. HOSPITAL - LATE AFTERNOONJim exits and walks out into the bright daylight of the
          forecourt. The camera begins to pull away from him.JIMHello?
                         
          Aside from a quiet rush of wind, there is silence. No
          traffic, no engines, no movement. Not even birdsong.EXT. LONDON - SUNDOWNJim walks through the empty city, from St. Thomas's Hospital,
          over Westminster Bridge, past the Houses of Parliament, down
          Whitehall, to Trafalgar Square.8.A bright overhead sun bleaches the streets. A light drifts
          litter and refuse. Cars lie abandoned, shops looted.
                         
          Jim is still wearing his hospital pyjamas, and carries a
          plastic bag full of soft-drink cans.EXT. CENTRAL LONDON ROAD/CHURCH - NIGHTJim walks. Night has fallen. He needs to find a place to
          rest...
                         
          He pauses. Down a narrow side street is a church. He walks
          towards it. The front doors are open.INT. CHURCH - NIGHTJim walks inside, moving with the respectful quietness that
          people adopt when entering a church.
                         
          The doors ahead to the main chamber are closed. Pushing them,
          gently trying the handle, it is obvious they are locked. But
          another open door is to his left. He goes through it.INT. CHURCH - STAIRWELL - NIGHTJim moves up a stairwell.
                         
          Written large on the wall is a single line of graffiti:REPENT. THE END IS EXTREMELY FUCKING NIGHINT. CHURCH - GALLERY LEVEL - NIGHTJim moves into the gallery level, and sees, through the dust
          and rot, ornate but faded splendor. At the far end, a stained-
          glass window is illuminated by the moonlight.
                         
          Jim pads in, stands at the gallery, facing the stained-glass
          window for a moment before looking down...
                         
          Beneath are hundreds of dead bodies. Layered over the floor,
          jammed into the pews, spilling over the altar. The scene of
          an unimaginable massacre.
                         
          Jim stands, stunned. Then sees, standing motionless at
          different positions facing away from him, four people.
                         
          Their postures and stillness make their status unclear. Jim
          hesitates before speaking.9.JIM...Hello?
                         
          Immediately, the four heads flick around. Infected.
                         
          And the next moment, there is the powerful thump of a door at
          the far end of the gallery.
                         
          Jim whirls to the source as the Infected below start to move.
                         
          The door thumps again - another stunningly powerful blow, the
          noise echoing around the chamber.
                         
          Confused, fist closing around his bag of soft drinks, Jim
          steps onto the gallery, facing the door...
                         
          ...and it smashes open.
                         
          Revealing an Infected Priest - who locks sight on Jim, and
          starts to sprint.JIMFather?
                         
          The Priest is half way across the galleryJIMFather, what are you...
                         
          And now the moonlight catches the Priest's face. Showing
          clearly: the eyes. The blood smeared and collected around his
          nose, ears, and mouth. Darkened and crusted, accumulated over
          days and weeks. Fresh blood glistening.JIMJesus!
                         
          In a movement of pure instinct, Jim swings the bag just as
          the Priest is about to reach him - and connects squarely with
          the man's head.JIMOh, that, was bad, that was bad...
           I shouldn't have done that...
                         
          He breaks into a run...INT. CHURCH - STAIRWELL - NIGHTDown the stairwell...10.INT. CHURCH - NIGHT...into the front entrance, where the locked door now strains
          under the blows of the Infected inside.JIMShit.EXT. CHURCH - NIGHTJim sprints down the stone steps.
                         
          As he reaches the bottom the doors are broken open, and the
          Infected give chase.EXT. CENTRAL LONDON ROAD - NIGHTJim runs - the Infected have almost reached him.
                         
          A hand fires up a Zippo lighter, and lights the rag of a
          Molotov cocktail.
                         
          As Jim runs, something flies past his head, and the Infected
          closest to him explodes in a ball of flame.
                         
          Jim turns, and sees as another Molotov cocktail explodes,
          engulfing two in the fireball.
                         
          He whirls, now completely bewildered.WOMAN'S VOICEHERE!Another Molotov cocktail explodes. The Infected stagger from
          the blaze, on fire.WOMAN'S VOICEOVER HERE!Jim whirls again, and sees, further down the road...
                         
          ...Selena, a black woman, also in her twenties. She wears a
          small backpack, a machete is stuck into her belt - and she
          holds a lit Molotov cocktail in her hand.
                         
          ...Mark, a tall, good-looking man - throwing another bottle.
                         
          It smashes on the head of the last Infected, bathing it in
          flame...
                         
          The burning Infected bumps blindly into a car. Falls. Gets up
          again.11.Blindly, it staggers off the road, into a petrol station -
          where an abandoned car has run over on the pumps.
                         
          The ground beneath it suddenly ignites, and the petrol
          station explodes.EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHTSelena and Mark lead Jim into a side street.JIM(DAZED)Those people! Who were... who...MARKThis way! Move it!
                         
          Jim allows himself to be hurried along.EXT. SHOP - NIGHTSelena stops outside a newsagent's shop. The shop's door and
          windows are covered with a metal security grill, but the
          grill over the door lock has been prised away enough for
          Selena to slip her hand through to the latch.INT. SHOP - NIGHTInside, most of the shelves have been emptied of
          confectionery. Newspapers and magazines litter the floor. The
          magazine covers of beautiful girls and sports cars have
          become instant anachronisms.
                         
          At the back of the shop, a makeshift bed of sheets and
          sleeping bag is nestled. This has obviously been Selena and
          Mark's home for the last few days.INT. NEWSAGENT - NIGHTJim, Mark and Selena enter the newsagent's and pull down the
          grill.MARKA man walks into a bar with a
           giraffe. They each get pissed. The
           giraffe falls over. The man goes to
           leave and the barman says, you
           can't leave that lying there. The
           man says, it's not a lion. It's a
           giraffe.12.Silence.
                         
          Mark pulls off his mask and turns to Selena.MARKHe's completely humorless. You two
           will get along like a house on
           fire.
                         
          Selena, who has already taken off her mask, ignores Mark.SELENAWho are you? You've come from a
           hospital.MARKAre you a doctor?SELENAHe's not a doctor. He's a patient.JIMI'm a bicycle courier. I was riding
           a package from Farringdon to
           Shaftesbury Avenue. A car cut
           across me... and then I wake up in
           hospital, today... I wake up and
           I'm hallucinating, or...MARKWhat's your name?JIMJim.MARKI'm Mark. This is Selena.(BEAT)Okay, Jim. We've got some bad news.
                         
          Selena starts to tell her story, and as the story unfolds we
          see the images she describes.SELENAIt began as rioting. And right from
           the beginning, you knew something
           bad was going on because the
           rioters were killing people. And
           then it wasn't on the TV anymore.
           It was in the street outside. It
           was coming through your windows. We
           all guessed it was a virus. An
           infection. You didn't need a doctor
           to tell you that. It was the blood.13.Something in the blood. By the time
           they tried to evacuate the cities,
           it was already too late. The
           infection was everywhere. The army
           blockades were overrun. And that
           was when the exodus started. The
           day before the radio and TV stopped
           broadcasting there were reports of
           infection in Paris and New York. We
           didn't hear anything more after
           that.JIMWhere are your families?MARKThey're dead.SELENAYours will be dead too.JIMNo... No! I'm going to find them.

           unless you've got no choice. We'll
           take you tomorrow. Then we'll all
           go and find your dead parents.
           Okay?EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - DAYJim, Selena and Mark walk along the Docklands Light Railway
          in single file. Ahead is a train.
                         
          Behind the train, as if spilled in its wake, are abandoned
          bags, suitcases, backpacks.
                         
          Mark drops pace to let Jim catch up.14.MARKHow's your head? Fucked?

           millions of windows, and you're
           thinking - there's no way this many
           people are dead. It's just too many
           windows.
                         
          Mark picks up a handbag from the tracks.MARKThe person who owned this bag.
           Can't be dead.
                         
          Mark reaches in and starts to pull things out as they walk,
          discarding the personal possessions.MARKA woman - (car keys) - who drove a
           Nissan Micra - (teddy) - and had a

          He hands the bag to Jim and walks ahead.
                         
          Jim pulls out a mobile phone.
                         
          He switches it on.
                         
          It reads: SEARCHING FOR NETWORK.
                         
          The message blinks a couple of times. Then the screen goes
          blank.
                         
          Jim looks left.
                         
          He is now alongside the train. The inside of the windows are
          smeared with dried blood. Pressed against the glass is the
          face of a dead man.15.Jim drops the phone and breaks into a run - running past Mark
          and Selena.MARK(HISSING)Hey!EXT. GREENWICH COMMON - DAYJim, Selena and Mark jog across Greenwich Common. Jim

          downstairs of the house.16.Surprisingly, everything is neat and tidy. Washed plates are
          stacked by the sink, newspapers on the table are neatly
          piled. The headline on the top paper reads simply:CONTAINMENT FAILS.They reach the bottom of the stairs. Selena gestures upwards,
          and Jim nods. They start to ascend.
                         
          At the top of the stairs, Selena sniffs the air, and recoils.
          Jim has noticed it too. His eyes widen in alarm.MARK(WHISPERS)Wait.
                         
          But Jim pushes past and advances along the top landing, until
          he reaches a door. By now the smell is so bad that he is
          having to cover his nose and mouth with the sleeve of one
          arm.
                         
          Jim pushes open the door. Inside, two decomposed bodies lie
          side by side on the bed, intertwined. On the bedside table
          are an empty bottle of sleeping pills and a bottle of red
          wine.
                         
          Mark appears behind him. Jim stares at his parents for a
          couple of moments, then Mark closes the door.INT. BATHROOM - DAYJim sits on the toilet, alone. He is crying. In his hand is a
          piece of paper: "Jim - with endless love, we left you
          sleeping. Now we're sleeping with you. Don't wake up."
                         
          The paper crumples in his fist.INT. LIVING ROOM - DAYJim, Selena and Mark sit in the living room, on the two
          sofas. Jim looks dazed, uncomprehending. Selena watches Jim,
          her expression neutral.SELENAThey died peacefully. You should be
           grateful.JIMI'm not grateful.
                         
          Jim's words hang a moment. Then Mark talks, simply,
          unemotionally, matter-of-fact throughout.17.MARKThe roads out were all jammed. So
           we went to Paddington Station.
           Hoping: maybe we could get to
           Heathrow, maybe buy our way on a
           plane. My dad had all this cash,
           even though cash was already
           useless, and Mum had her jewellery.
           But twenty thousand other people
           had the same idea.(A MOMENT)The crowd was surging, and I lost
           my grip on my sister's hand. I
           remember realizing the ground was
           soft. I looked down, and I was
           standing on people. Like a carpet,
           people who had fallen, and...
           somewhere in the crowd there were
           infected. It spread fast, no one
           could run, all you could do was
           climb. Over more people. So I did
           that. I got up, somehow, on top of
           a kiosk.(A MOMENT)Looking down, you couldn't tell
           which faces were infected and which
           weren't. With the blood, the
           screaming, they all looked the
           same. And I saw my dad. Not my mum
           or my sister. But I saw my dad. His
           face.
                         
          A short silence.MARKSelena's right. You should be
           grateful.SELENAWe don't have time to get back to
           the shop before dark. We should
           stay here tonight.
                         
          Jim nods. He isn't sure what he wants to say.JIMMy old room was at the end of the
           landing. You two take it. I'll
           sleep down here.SELENAWe'll sleep in the same room. It's
           safer.18.EXT. LONDON - DAY TO NIGHTThe red orb of the sun goes down; the light fades. As night
          falls, London vanishes into blackness, with no electric light
          to be seen.
                         
          Then the moon appears from behind the cloud layer, and the
          dark city is revealed.INT. HOUSE - NIGHTJim is on the sofa. In the moonlight, we can see that his
          eyes are open, wide awake. Selena is curled on the other
          sofa, and Mark is on the floor - both asleep. The house is
          silent.
                         
          Jim watches Selena sleeping for a couple of moments.
                         
          Then, quietly, he gets off the sofa and pads out of the
          living room, down the hall to the kitchen.INT. KITCHEN - NIGHTJim enters, standing just inside the doorway. He looks around
          the room. On one wall, a faded kid's drawing of a car is
          framed. Above the counter, on a shelf of cookery books, an
          album has a handwritten label on the spine: "Mum's Favorite
          Recipes".
                         
          Jim walks to the fridge. Stuck to the door is a photo of Jim
          with his parents, arm in arm, smiling at the camera. Jim is
          on his mountain bike, wearing his courier bag.FLASH CUT TO:Jim, sitting at the kitchen table as his Mum enters, carrying
          bags of shopping. Jim walks over to the bags and pulls out a
          carton of orange juice, which he pulls straight to his mouth
          and begins to gulp down.
                         
          His Dad walks in from the garden.JIM'S DADGive me a glass of that, would you?JIM(draining the carton, and
           giving it a shake)
           It's empty.CUT BACK TO:19.Jim touches the photo, their faces, lightly.
                         
          Jim is facing away from the back door, which has a large
          frosted-glass panel.
                         
          Through the glass panel, unseen by Jim a dark silhouette
          looms against the diffused glow from the moonlight.
                         
          Through the kitchen window, a second silhouette appears.
                         
          Then there is a scratching noise from the back door.
                         
          Jim freezes.
                         
          Slowly, he turns his head, and sees the dark shapes behind
          the door and window.
                         
          A beat - then the door is abruptly and powerfully smashed in.
          It flies open, and hangs loosely held by the bottom hinge.
          Standing in the doorframe is an Infected Man.
                         
          Jim shouts with alarm as the Man lunges at him - and they
          both go tumbling to the floor. At the same moment, the figure
          behind the kitchen window smashes the glass, and an Infected
          Teenage Girl starts to clamber through the jagged frame.
                         
          The Man gets on top of Jim, while Jim uses his arms to hold
          back the ferocious assault. A single strand of saliva flies
          from the Man's lips, and contacts Jim's cheek.JIM(SCREAMS)Help!
                         
          Suddenly, Selena is there, holding her machete. The blade
          flashes down to the back of the Man's neck. Blood gushes.
                         
          Jim rolls the Infected Man off, just in time to see...
                         
          ...Mark dispatch the Girl half way through the kitchen
          window. The Girl is holding Mark, but her legs are caught on
          the broken glass.
                         
          Mark jabs upwards into the Girl's torso - she stiffens, then
          slumps, and as Mark steps back we see he is holding a knife.
                         
          Jim hyperventilates, staring at the corpse on the kitchen
          floor.JIMIt's Mr. Bridges...
                         
          Selena turns to Jim. She is hyperventilating too, but there
          is control and steel in her voice.20.SELENAWere you bitten?JIMHe lives four doors down...
                         
          Jim turns to the Girl sprawled half way through the window.JIMThat's his daughter...SELENAWere you bitten?
                         
          Jim looks at her. Selena is still holding her machete at the
          ready.JIMNo... No! I wasn't!SELENADid any of the blood get in your
           mouth?JIMNo!SELENAMark?
                         
          Jim turns to Mark. He is standing in the middle of the room.
          Stepped away from the window. The Girl's blood is on his arm -
          and he is wiping it away...
                         
          ...off the skin... where a long scratch cut wells up fresh
          blood.
                         
          A moment.
                         
          Then Mark looks at Selena, as if slightly startled.MARKWait.
                         
          But Selena is swiping with her machete. Mark lifts his arm
          instinctively, defensively, and the blade sinks in.
                         
          Selena immediately yanks it back.MARKDON'T!Selena swipes again - and the blade catches Mark hard in the
          side of the head. Mark falls.21.Jim watches, scrabbling backwards on the floor away from
          them, as Selena brutally finishes Mark off.
                         
          Selena looks at Mark's body for a couple of beats, then
          lowers the blade. She picks up a dishcloth from the sink
          counter and tosses it to Jim.SELENAGet that cleaned off.
                         
          Jim picks up the rag and hurriedly starts to wipe the

           I... I don't know. I think so.SELENAThen get them. And get dressed. We
           have to leave, now.
                         
          With practiced speed, Selena starts to open the kitchen
          cupboards, selecting packets of biscuits and cans from the
          shelves, and stuffing them into her backpack.SELENAMore infected will be coming. They
           always do.EXT. HOUSE - NIGHTJim and Selena exit the front door. Jim has changed out of
          his hospital gear into jeans and a sweatshirt. He also has a
          small backpack, and is carrying a baseball bat.EXT. LONDON ROAD - NIGHTJim and Selena walk: fast, alert. But something is not being

           Okay? I didn't know. He knew. I
           could see it in his face.(A MOMENT)You need to understand, if someone
           gets infected, you've got somewhere
           between ten and twenty seconds to
           kill them. They might be your
           brother or your sister or your
           oldest friend. It makes no
           difference Just so as you know, if

          Jim says nothing.SELENAHe was full of plans. Long-distance
           weapons, so they don't get close. A
           newsagent's with a metal grill, so

          A few moments later, Jim lifts a hand, opens his mouth, about
          to say something - but Selena cuts him off without even
          looking round.SELENAShhh.
                         
          She has seen something...
                         
          A line of tower blocks some distance away, standing against
          the night sky. In one of them, hanging in the window of one
          of the highest stories, colored fairy lights are lit up,
          blinking gently.INT. TOWER BLOCK - NIGHTJim and Selena walk through the smashed glass doors of the
          tower block. It is extremely dark inside.
                         
          Selena switches on a flashlight and illuminates the entrance
          hall. It is a mess. The floor is covered in broken glass and
          dried blood. The lift doors are jammed open, and inside is a
          dense bundle of rags - perhaps an old corpse, but impossible
          to tell, because the interior of the lift has been torched.
          It is black with carbon, and smoke-scarring runs up the
          outside wall.
                         
          Selena moves the flashlight to the stairwell. There is a huge
          tangle of shopping trolleys running up the stairs.
                         
          Selena gives one of the trolleys an exploratory tug. It
          shifts, but holds fast, meshed in with its neighbor. Then she
          puts a foot into one of the grates, and lifts herself up.
          Shining her light over the top of the tangle, she can see a
          gap along the top.JIMLet's hope we don't have to get out
           of here in a hurry.
                         
          She begins to climb through.INT. TOWER BLOCK - NIGHTJim and Selena move steadily and quietly up the stairwell,
          into the building. Reaching a next landing, they check around
          the corner before proceeding. Through a broken window, we can
          see that they are already high above most London buildings,
          and on the wall a sign reads: LEVEL 5.24.SELENANeed a break?JIM(completely out of breath)
           No. You?SELENANo.

          Selena nods. They stop on the stairs. Jim slips off his
          backpack and sits, pulling a face as he does so...SELENAWhat's up?JIMNothing.
                         
          She gives him a cut-the-crap expression.JIMI've got a headache.SELENABad?JIMPretty bad.SELENAWhy didn't you say something
           before?JIMBecause I didn't think you'd give a
           shit.
                         
          A moment, where it's unclear how Selena will react to this.
          Then she slips off her own backpack.SELENA(going through the bag)
           You've got no fat on you, and all
           you've had to eat is sugar. So
           you're crashing. Unfortunately,
           there isn't a lot we can do about

          Jim.SELENAAs for the sugar: Lilt or Tango?JIM(CHEWING CODEINE)...Do you have Sprite?SELENAActually, I did have a can of
           Sprite, but...
                         
          Suddenly there is a loud scream, coming from somewhere lower
          down the building. Jim and Selena both make a grab for their
          weapons.JIMJesus!SELENAQuiet.
                         
          The scream comes again. The noise is chilling, echoing up the
          empty stairwell.
                         
          But there is something strange about it. The noise is human,
          but oddly autistic. It is held for slightly too long, and
          stops abruptly.SELENAThat's an infected.
                         
          Then, the sound of metal scraping, clattering the blockade.SELENAThey're in.INT. SHOPPING TROLLEY BLOCKADE - NIGHTTwo Infected, a Young Asian Guy and a Young White Guy, moving
          with amazing speed over the blockade.26.INT. STAIRS - NIGHTJim and Selena sprint up the stairs. Behind them, we can hear
          the Infected, giving chase, howling.
                         
          They pass level eight, nine, ten...

           able to speak)
           I can't.
                         
          Selena continues, and Jim looks over the edge of the
          stairwell, to the landing below...
                         
          ...where the two Infected appear, tearing around the corner.INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHTSelena sprints up the stairs... and Jim sprints past her, in
          an amazing burst of energy and speed.
                         
          They round another bend in the stairwell...
                         
          ...then both Jim and Selena scream. Standing directly in
          front of them is a Man In Riot Cop Gear - helmet with full
          visor, gloves, a riot shield in one hand, and a length of
          lead pipe in the other.
                         
          The Man lunges past both of them, barging past, where the
          Infected White Man has appeared at the stairwell.
                         
          The Riot Gear Man swings his lead pipe and connects viciously
          with the White Man's head. The White Man falls backwards
          against the Asian Man. Both fall back down the stairs.
                         
          The Riot Gear Man turns back to Jim and Selena.MANDown the corridor! Flat 157!
                         
          Jim and Selena are stunned, but start to run down the
          corridor.
                         
          The Asian Man is coming back up the stairs. Jim looks back
          over his shoulder in time to see the Riot Gear Man deliver a
          massive blow to the Asian Man's head.27.INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHTJim and Selena run towards Flat 157. The door is open, but as
          they approach, it suddenly slams shut.JIM AND SELENA(hammering on the door)
           Let us in!GIRL (O.S.)Who is it?SELENALet us in!
                         
          The door opens a fraction, on the chain. The face of a girl
          appears. She is fourteen, pale, solemn-faced.GIRLWhere's Dad?
                         
          Jim looks back down the corridor.
                         
          At the far end, the Man appears. He is holding the limp body
          of one of the Infected - and he tips it over the balcony,
          where it drops down the middle of the stairwell.MAN(CALLS BACK)It's okay, Hannah. Let them inside.
                         
          The door closes, we hear the chain being slipped off, then it
          opens again.INT. FLAT - NIGHTJim and Selena enter past the pale-faced girl. The flat is
          council, three-bed, sixteenth floor of the block. It has
          patterned wallpaper, and nice but boring furnishings. It is
          lit by candles.
                         
          The entrance hall leads straight to the living room, which
          has French windows and a small balcony outside.
                         
          On one wall, a framed photograph hangs, which shows the Man
          standing beside a black taxi cab. Next to him is a middle
          aged woman - presumably the Man's wife. Hannah sits at the
          cab's steering wheel, beaming.
                         
          Another photo, beside, show Hannah sat in the seat of a go-
          kart.
                         
          The Man follows Jim and Selena inside.28.MANCome in, come in.
                         
          They follow the Man through to the living room, and Hannah
          recloses the front door, which has an impressive arrangement
          of locks and dead-bolts.INT. FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHTIn the living room, the fairy lights hang in the window,
          powered by a car battery. Lit by their glow, the Man goes
          through a careful ritual of shedding his gear, helped by
          Hannah.
                         
          First, he lays down the riot shield. Then he puts the
          bloodsmeared lead pipe on a small white towel. Next, he
          removes his gloves - and places them beside the bar on the
          towel. Then he folds the towel over the weapon and gloves,
          and puts it beside the riot shield. Finally he removes the
          visored helmet.
                         
          Jim and Selena watch him. They look pretty rattled, not
          really knowing what to expect.
                         
          After the Man has finished shedding his gear, he turns.MANSo... I'm Frank, anyway.
                         
          He extends his hand to Jim and Selena. Jim hesitates very
          briefly, then shakes it.JIMI'm Jim.SELENASelena.
                         
          Frank beams, and suddenly he seems much less frightening and
          imposing. If anything, he is just as nervous as Jim and
          Selena.FRANKJim and Selena. Good to meet you.
           And this is my daughter, Hannah.
           (turning to Hannah)
           ...Come on, sweetheart. Say hello.
                         
          Hannah takes a step into the room, but says nothing.FRANKSo... so this is great. Just great.
           It calls for a celebration.29.I'd say. Why don't you all sit
           down, and... Hannah, what have we
           got to offer?HANNAH(QUIETLY)We've got Mum's creme de menthe.
                         
          An awkward beat.FRANKYes, her creme de menthe. Great.
           Look, sit, please. Get comfortable.
           Sit tight while I get it.
                         
          Frank exits. Selena, Jim and Hannah all stand, until Selena
          gestures at the sofa.SELENAShall we?
                         
          Jim and Selena take the sofa. Hannah stays standing.FRANK (O.S.)Where are the bloody glasses?HANNAHMiddle cupboard.FRANK (O.S.)No! The good ones! This is a
           celebration!HANNAHTop cupboard.
                         
          Another short, uncomfortable pause. Hannah looks at Jim and
          Selena from her position near the doorway. Her expression is
          blank and unreadable.JIMThis is your place, then.
                         
          Hannah nods.JIMIt's nice.
                         
          Hannah nods again.
                         
          Frank re-enters. Frank is beaming, holding the creme de
          menthe, and four wine glasses.30.FRANKThere! I know it isn't much but...
           well, cheers!EXT. TOWER BLOCK - NIGHTThe moon shines above the tower block.INT. FLAT - NIGHTJim, Selena and Hannah all sit in the living room, sipping
          creme de menthe. Frank is disconnecting the fairy lights as
          he talks, and pulling the curtains closed, rather
          systematically checking for cracks along the edges.FRANKNormally we keep the windows
           covered at night, because the light
           attracts them. But when we saw your

           to be survivors... So we hooked up
           the Christmas tree lights. Like a
           beacon.
                         
          Finished with the sofa, he sits on the armchair.SELENAWe're grateful.FRANKWell, we're grateful you came. I
           was starting to really worry. Like

          He puts a hand on Hannah's shoulder, and gives it a squeeze.FRANKWe've got by, haven't we?INT. BATHROOM - NIGHTJim is in the bathroom, inspecting himself in the mirror. He
          is just finishing shaving his beard off, and has had to use
          the razor dry. He has cut himself several times.
                         
          Jim does a couple of last dry strokes with the razor, and
          winces as he cuts himself again. He uses spit to wipe away
          the blood.
                         
          Then, from outside, Frank speaks.FRANK (O.S.)You okay in there, Jim?JIMYes. Fine.FRANK (O.S.)Sorry we couldn't spare the water
           but... it's the same with the
           toilet. The, er, flush doesn't

          Hannah speaks so rarely that her interjection seems to take

          flustered, but then she continues.HANNAHAnd anyway, it isn't true what Dad

          broken glass, and the front left tire blows.FRANKHOLD ON!Frank saws the wheel, but loses control. The cab scrapes
          along the side of an abandoned car, then slews to a halt.
                         
          Frank tries accelerating again, but the cab immediately pulls

          Jim and Selena stand at the back of the cab, weapons ready,

          At the front of the cab, Hannah pumps the jack, but it is
          moving with aching slowness.
                         
          At the back of the cab, Jim and Selena wait nervously.
                         
          There is a noise from further down the tunnel, in the
          direction which they came. A scrabbling rush of movement -
          but too quiet to be humans.

          Jim remains stopped by the pavement, one foot down for

          Behind rolls of razor wire are fifteen foot sheets of

          vehicle through, but concrete blocks force a chicane.59.On either side of the road there are sandbag nests. On the
          corrugated iron, white painted words read: 42ND BLOCKADE. But
          despite the impressive construction, there is no sign of

          It reaches the chicane, and eases around the concrete blocks.
          Then it passes through the gap in the corrugated barrier. On
          the other side of the blockade, canvas tents have been
          erected on the grass verge, and two transporter trucks are
          parked. A few packing crates and tarpaulins are also
          scattered around. But still no signs of life. The blockade
          appears to have been abandoned.

          Cautiously, they begin to explore. They first head over to
          the grass verge and the tents. In front of one of them,
          Hannah picks up a Bergen backpack. She upends it, and a few
          clothes fall out.
                         
          Frank moves past her, and carefully pulls back the tent flaps

          walks away.EXT. BLOCKADE - DAYFrank walks underneath the archway of one of the blockade
          structures, and sits down. Needing to be alone.
                         
          His head sinks, staring at the ground beneath his legs. A
          couple of moments later he looks up - and sees that sitting
          opposite of him, on the other side of the archway, almost
          mirroring his posture and position, is a dead Infected.
                         
          The corpse of the Infected sits gazing back at Frank with
          sightless eyes.
                         
          A moment between the two of them. A blank-faced exchange.
                         
          Frank looks left and sees the corpse of another Infected, a
          few feet beyond the blockade. And another, beyond it. And
          another, a few more feet to the right.
                         
          Then Frank looks upwards. Above him, on the walkway of the
          blockade, another corpse lies. And this corpse is swarmed
          with crows, picking at it.
                         
          Frank gets up.FRANK(under his breath)

          past them.
                         
          In a rage again, Frank goes under the blockade and starts to
          kick it. The scaffold clangs, vibrates, and - startled - the
          crows lift off from the mutilated corpse and fly...62....dislodging, or disrupting, a single droplet of blood from
          the corpse, that rolls off the neck, and begins to fall
          downwards.
                         
          Down... to where Frank gazes upwards.
                         
          The droplet splashes, pinpoint perfect, on Frank's eye.
                         
          Frank frowns, his hand immediately going to his face. The
          fingers come away, with the tiny smear of red.HANNAHDad... are you okay?

          unkempt and overgrown.
                         
          The jeep pulls up by the front steps. Waiting there is
          another soldier, a major. Like the other soldiers, he is
          unshaven, but has the authority of command about him, even in
          the relaxed way that he stands.

           hundreds of infected out of

          The laundry starts to billow - and with it we hear the sound
          of rushing movement. As a darkly stained sheet is ripped
          aside, an Infected is revealed only a few feet away.
                         
          Jim jumps back, but Henry stays put - as the Infected is
          suddenly jerked backwards by a chain around its neck.HENRY...meet Mailer.
                         
          Mailer is uniformed. A soldier. Apart from the chain around

          Jim seems to want to reply, but doesn't have the words.
                         
          Instead, he lifts Selena's face and kisses her on the lips...

          More laughter at Bell - interrupted by the sergeant, Farrell,
          who conspicuously is not joining in.FARRELLI think Bell's got a point. If you
           look at the whole life of the

           before that, and before that, as
           far back as I care to remember...

          He is in a cellar. Farrell is on the other side of the small
          room, also tied.
                         
          Jim, blind, looks around at the sound of Farrell's voice.FARRELLYou know what they're doing, a few
           hundred miles from here? Across the
           channel, across the Atlantic,
           they're eating dinner. They're
           wondering what to watch on TV
           tonight. They're sleeping next to
           their wives.
                         
          Jim's head turns.FARRELLBut we're here, chained to a
           fucking radiator because the OC has
           gone insane. Starting the world
           again when the rest of the world
           hasn't even fucking stopped. Think
           about it! How could infection cross
           the oceans? How could it cross the
           mountains and the rivers? They
           stopped it. And right now TVs are
           playing and planes are flying in
           the sky and the world is continuing
           as fucking normal. Think. Actually
           think about it. What would you do

          small forest at the back of the mansion garden.
                         
          Time has passed. It has started raining. Both Jim and Farrell
          have been badly beaten. Jim's shirt is ripped. Blood runs
          from his nose, and from a cut on the side of his head. He
          seems dazed. Numbed. More by the situation than his beating.EXT. EXECUTION GROUND - DAYJim and Farrell are led into a clearing. Just ahead is a
          high, ivy-covered brick wall - the perimeter wall of the
          mansion. And at the base of the wall are bodies. Stacked,
          tangled, swarming with flies.
                         
          Jim turns, and sees Mitchell and Jones standing behind him.FARRELLCome on then, you fucking pansies.
           Do me first.
                         
          Mitchell grins, and pulls out his bayonet.FARRELLSo you're going to stick me,
           Mitchell? Is that it?(TO JONES)Is that how you're going to let
           your sergeant go out, Jones?JONESNo, Mitch. Do it with the gun.
                         
          Mitchell ignores Jones, and starts to fix the blade to the
          end of his gun.80.FARRELLYou're going to let him stick me,

          Farrell spits in Mitchell's face.MITCHELLI'm going to enjoy this.
                         
          Mitchell pulls back his bayonet, and at that moment, there is
          an explosion of gunfire. Jones has fired and killed Farrell.
                         
          As Farrell drops, the enraged Mitchell turns on Jones.MITCHELLYou stupid cunt! What are you
           doing?
                         
          Mitchell knocks Jones down, putting his gun right in Jones's
          face.JONES(WHIRLING)How did he...
                         
          They turn. Jim has vanished.
                         
          From the side of the clearing, in the trees, there is the
          sound of sudden movement.JONESThere!81.Both men immediately set off, diving back into the foliage...

          complete.EXT. TREES - DAY - LIGHT RAINMitchell and Jones move fast, scanning, pushing through the
          undergrowth. Mitchell is absolutely furious. And as they run,
          they startle a couple of birds, which fly up from the ground,
          making a suspiciously familiar noise...
                         
          They both have the same realization at the same moment.EXT. EXECUTION GROUND - DAYMitchell and Jones burst back into the clearing, and they
          start firing into the bodies, emptying a full clip into the
          corpses...
                         
          ....Silence.
                         
          Then Jones looks up to the ivy-colored wall...following the
          path of the ivy upwards, to the coiled razor wire, where a
          scrap of torn and bloody clothing hangs.JONESOh no. We're fucked, we're fucked.MITCHELLNo problem. He's outside. No gun.
           No vehicle. He's a dead man.EXT. WOODS - DAYJim runs through the woods, away from the mansion. His hands
          are still tied.
                         
          He is out of breath, frightened, jumping at every sound.
                         
          Then he trips, rolls down a short slope, and when he comes to
          rest, he is looking upwards.
                         
          Above him, there is a parting in the clouds, and through the
          parting is blue sky.82.And across the sky, bisecting the blue, is a single vapor
          trail.
                         
          A pin-prick of silver plane. Followed by a sonic boom. As
          much in Jim's head as anywhere else.CUT TO:INT. DOOR - DAYClose-up of a closed door, with the sounds of a struggle on

          Hannah and Selena are cornered by Clifton, Bedford, Bell and
          Davis. The soldiers are hyped. Bedford pulls clothes out of a
          wardrobe, yanking out dresses, underwear - throwing them at
          the girls.
                         
          Bell stands by the closed door - frightened, caught like a

          amazement, yanks him around.
                         
          Then she kisses him on the lips. Simply, but unambiguously.

          this time, when we pull away, we see he is lying on a double

          Also outside is Hannah, who is arranging huge lengths of
          material on the grass.
                         
          From our ground-level angle, there is no sense to be made of

          roar of a jet engine.
