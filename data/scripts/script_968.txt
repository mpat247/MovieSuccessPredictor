               As a hand comes down stamping a GRAY STRIPE across a 
               registration card, there is absolute silence... then MUSIC, 
               the Hungarian love song, "Gloomy Sunday," distant... and the 
               stripe bleeds into COLOR, into BRIGHT YELLOW INK.INT. HOTEL ROOM - CRACOW, POLAND - NIGHTThe song plays from a radio on a rust-stained sink.

               The light in the room is dismal, the furniture cheap. The 
               curtains are faded, the wallpaper peeling... but the clothes 
               laid out across the single bed are beautiful.

               The hands of a man button the shirt, belt the slacks. He 
               slips into the double-breasted jacket, knots the silk tie, 
               folds a handkerchief and tucks it into the jacket pocket, 
               all with great deliberation.

               A bureau. Some currency, cigarettes, liquor, passport. And 
               an elaborate gold-on-black enamel Hakenkreuz (or swastika) 
               which the gentleman pins to the lapel of his elegant dinner 
               jacket.

               He steps back to consider his reflection in the mirror. He 
               likes what he sees: Oskar Schindler -- salesman from Zwittau -- 
               looking almost reputable in his one nice suit.

               Even in this awful room.INT. NIGHTCLUB - CRACOW, POLAND - NIGHTA spotlight slicing across a crowded smoke-choked club to a 
               small stage where a cabaret performer sings.

               It�s September, 1939. General Sigmund List's armored 
               divisions, driving north from the Sudetenland, have taken 
               Cracow, and now, in this club, drinking, socializing, 
               conducting business, is a strange clientele: SS officers and 
               Polish cops, gangsters and girls and entrepreneurs, thrown 
               together by the circumstance of war.

               Oskar Schindler, drinking alone, slowly scans the room, the 
               faces, stripping away all that�s unimportant to him, settling 
               only on details that are: the rank of this man, the higher 
               rank of that one, money being slipped into a hand.WAITER SETS DOWN DRINKSin front of the SS officer who took the money. A lieutenant, 
               he�s at a table with his girlfriend and a lower-ranking

               The waiter is gesturing to a table across the room where 
               Schindler, seemingly unaware of the SS men, drinks with the 
               best-looking woman in the place.LIEUTENANTDo I know him?

               His sergeant doesn�t. His girlfriend doesn't.LIEUTENANTFind out who he is.

               The sergeant makes his way over to Schindler's table.

               There's a handshake and introductions before -- and the 
               lieutenant, watching, can't believe it -- his guy accepts 
               the chair Schindler's dragging over.

               The lieutenant waits, but his man doesn't come back; he's 
               forgotten already he went there for a reason. Finally, and 
               it irritates the SS man, he has to get up and go over there.LIEUTENANTStay here.

               His girlfriend watches him cross toward Schindler's table.

               Before he even arrives, Schindler is up and berating him for 
               leaving his date way over there across the room, waving at 
               the girl to come join them, motioning to waiter to slide 
               some tables together.WAITERS ARRIVE WITH PLATES OF CAVIARand another round of drinks. The lieutenant makes a 
               halfhearted move for his wallet.LIEUTENANTLet me get this one.SCHINDLERNo, put it away, put it away.

               Schindler's already got his money out. Even as he's paying, 
               his eyes are working the room, settling on a table where a 
               girl is declining the advances of two more high-ranking SS 
               men.A TABLECLOTH BILLOWSas a waiter lays it down on another table that's been added 
               to the others. Schindler seats the SS officers on either 
               side of his own "date" --SCHINDLERWhat are you drinking, gin?

               He motions to a waiter to refill the men's drinks, and, 
               returning to the head of the table(s), sweeps the room again 
               with his eyes.ROAR OF LAUGHTERerupts from Schindler's party in the corner. Nobody's having 
               a better time than those people over there. His guests have 
               swelled to ten or twelve -- SS men, Polish cops, girls -- 
               and he moves among them like the great entertainer he is, 
               making sure everybody's got enough to eat and drink.

               Here, closer, at this table across the room, an SS officer 
               gestures to one of the SS men who an hour ago couldn't get 
               the girl to sit at his table. The guy comes over.SS OFFICER 1Who is that?SS OFFICER 2(like everyone knows)
                         That's Oskar Schindler. He's an old

               face and focuses.

               As the bulb flashes, the noise of the club suddenly drops 
               out, and the moment is caught in BLACK and WHITE: Oskar 
               Schindler, surrounded by his many new friends, smiling 
               urbanely.EXT. SQUARE - CRACOW - DAYA photograph of a face on a work card, BLACK and WHITE. A

               People in long lines, waiting. Others near idling trucks, 
               waiting. Others against sides of buildings, waiting. Clerks

               Behind Schindler, the door to another apartment closes softly. 
               A radio, somewhere, is suddenly silenced.SCHINDLERAre you Itzhak Stern?

               At the door of this apartment, a man with the face and manner 
               of a Talmudic scholar, finally nods in resignation, like his 
               number has just come up.STERNI am.

               Schindler offers a hand. Confused, Stern tentatively reaches 
               for it, and finds his own grasped firmly.INT. STERN'S APARTMENT - DAYSettled into an overstuffed chair in a simple apartment, 
               Schindler pours a shot of cognac from a flask.SCHINDLERThere's a company you did the books 
                         for on Lipowa Street, made what, 
                         pots and pans?

               Stern stares at the cognac Schindler's offering him. He 
               doesn't know who this man is, or what he wants.STERN(pause)
                         By law, I have to tell you, sir, I'm 
                         a Jew.

               Schindler looks puzzled, then shrugs, dismissing it.SCHINDLERAll right, you've done it -- good 
                         company, you think?

               He keeps holding out the drink. Stern declines it with a 
               slow shake of his head.STERNIt did all right.

               Schindler nods, takes out a cigarette case.SCHINDLERI don't know anything about 
                         enamelware, do you?

               He offers Stern a cigarette. Stern declines again.STERNI was just the accountant.SCHINDLERSimple engineering, though, wouldn't 
                         you think? Change the machines around, 
                         whatever you do, you could make other 
                         things, couldn't you?

               Schindler lowers his voice as if there could possibly be 
               someone else listening in somewhere.SCHINDLERField kits, mess kits...

               He waits for a reaction, and misinterprets Stern's silence 
               for a lack of understanding.SCHINDLERArmy contracts.

               But Stern does understand. He understands too well.

               Schindler grins good-naturedly.SCHINDLEROnce the war ends, forget it, but 
                         for now it's great, you could make a 
                         fortune. Don't you think?STERN(with an edge)
                         I think most people right now have 
                         other priorities.

               Schindler tries for a moment to imagine what they could 
               possibly be. He can't.SCHINDLERLike what?

               Stern smiles despite himself. The man's manner is so simple, 
               so in contrast to his own and the complexities of being a 
               Jew in occupied Cracow in 1939. He really doesn't know. Stern 
               decides to end the conversation.STERNGet the contracts and I'm sure you'll 
                         do very well. In fact the worse things 
                         get the better you'll do. It was a 
                         "pleasure."SCHINDLERThe contracts? That's the easy part. 
                         Finding the money to buy the company, 
                         that's hard.

               He laughs loudly, uproariously. But then, just as abruptly 
               as the laugh erupted, he's dead serious, all kidding aside --SCHINDLERYou know anybody?

               Stern stares at him curiously, sitting there taking another 
               sip of his cognac, placid as a large dog.SCHINDLERJews, yeah. Investors.STERN(pause)
                         Jews can no longer own businesses, 
                         sir, that's why this one's for sale.SCHINDLERWell, they wouldn't own it, I'd own 
                         it. I'd pay them back in product. 
                         They can trade it on the black market, 
                         do whatever they want, everybody's 
                         happy.

               He shrugs; it sounds more than fair to him. But not to Stern.STERNPots and pans.SCHINDLER(nodding)
                         Something they can hold in their 
                         hands.

               Stern studies him. This man is nothing more than a salesman 
               with a salesman's pitch; just dressed better than most.STERNI don't know anybody who'd be 
                         interested in that.SCHINDLER(a slow knowing nod)
                         They should be.

               scattered parishioners. Lots of empty pews.

               The young Polish Jew from the street, Poldek Pfefferberg, 
               kneels, crosses himself, and slides in next to another young 
               man, Goldberg, going over notes scribbled on a little pad 
               inside a missal. Pfefferberg shows him a container of shoe 
               polish he takes from his pocket. Whispered, bored --GOLDBERGWhat's that?PFEFFERBERGYou don't recognize it? Maybe that's 
                         because it's not what I asked for.GOLDBERGYou asked for shoe polish.PFEFFERBERGMy buyers sold it to a guy who sold 
                         it to the Army. But by the time it 
                         got there -- because of the cold -- 
                         it broke, the whole truckload.GOLDBERG(pause)

               Goldberg doesn't bother; he pockets his little notepad and 
               intones a response to the priest's prayer, all but ignoring 
               Pfefferberg.PFEFFERBERGThis is not your problem? Everybody 
                         wants to know who I got it from, and 
                         I'm going to tell them.

               Goldberg glances to Pfefferberg for the first time, and, 
               greatly put upon, takes out his little notepad again and 
               makes a notation in it.GOLDBERGMetal.

               He flips the pad closed, pockets it, crosses himself as he 
               gets up, and leaves.INT. HOTEL - DAYPfefferberg at the front desk of a sleepy hotel with another 
               black market middleman, the desk clerk. Both are wearing 
               their armbands. Pfefferberg underlines figures on a little 
               notepad of his own --PFEFFERBERGLet's say this is what you give me. 
                         These are fees I have to pay some 
                         guys. This is my commission. This is 
                         what I bring you back in Occupation 
                         currency.

               The clerk, satisfied with the figures, is about to hand over 
               to Pfefferberg some outlawed Polish notes from an envelope 
               when Schindler comes in from the street. The clerk puts the 
               money away, gets Schindler his room key, waits for him to 
               leave so he can finish his business with Pfefferberg... but 
               Schindler doesn't leave; he just keeps looking over at 
               Pfefferberg's shirt, at the cuffs, the collar.PFEFFERBERGThat's a nice shirt.

               Pfefferberg nods, Yeah, thanks, and waits for Schindler to 
               leave; but he doesn't. Nor does he appear to hear the short 
               burst of muffled gunfire that erupts from somewhere up the 
               street.SCHINDLERYou don't know where I could find a 
                         shirt like that.

               Pfefferberg knows he should say 'no,' let that be the end of 
               it. It's not wise doing business with a German who could 
               have you arrested for no reason whatsoever. But there's 
               something guileless about it.PFEFFERBERGLike this?SCHINDLER(nodding)
                         There's nothing in the stores.

               The clerk tries to discourage Pfefferberg from pursuing this 
               transaction with just a look. Pfefferberg ignores it.PFEFFERBERGYou have any idea what a shirt like 
                         this costs?SCHINDLERNice things cost money.

               The clerk tries to tell Pfefferberg again with a look that 
               this isn't smart.PFEFFERBERGHow many?SCHINDLERI don't know, ten or twelve. That's 
                         a good color. Dark blues, grays.

               Schindler takes out his money and begins peeling off bills, 
               waiting for Pfefferberg to nod when it's enough. He's being 
               overcharged, and he knows it, but Pfefferberg keeps pushing 
               it, more. The look Schindler gives him lets him know that 
               he's trying to hustle a hustler, but that, in this instance 
               at least, he'll let it go. He hands over the money and 
               Pfefferberg hands over his notepad.PFEFFERBERGWrite down your measurements.

               As he writes down the information, Pfefferberg glances to 
               the desk clerk and offers a shrug. As he writes --SCHINDLERI'm going to need some other things. 
                         As things come up.EXT. GARDEN - SCHERNER'S RESIDENCE - CRACOW - DAYAs Oberfuhrer Scherner and his daughter, in a wedding gown, 
               dance to the music of a quartet on a bandstand, the reception 
               guests drink and eat at tables set up on an expansive lawn.CZURDAThe SS doesn't own the trains, 
                         somebody's got to pay. Whether it's 
                         a passenger car or a livestock car, 
                         it doesn't matter -- which, by the 
                         way, you have to see. You have to 
                         set aside an afternoon, go down to 
                         the station and see this.

               Other SS and Army officers share the table with Czurda.

               Schindler, too, nice blue shirt, jacket, only he doesn't 
               seem to be paying attention; rather his attention and 
               affections are directed to the blonde next to him, Ingrid.CZURDASo you got thousands of fares that 
                         have to be paid. Since it's the SS

               this, but actually seeing the juxtaposition -- human and 
               cattle cars -- this is something else.

                         have him.SCHINDLERI'm talking to a clerk.

               Schindler pulls out a small notepad and drops his voice to a 
               hard murmur, the growl of a reasonable man who isn't ready -- 
               yet -- to bring out his heavy guns:SCHINDLERWhat's your name?CLERKSir, the list is correct.SCHINDLERI didn't ask you about the list, I

                         Armaments Board will want to know 
                         why.

               The sergeant takes a good hard look at the clothes, at the 
               pin, at the man wearing them.SERGEANT(to the clerk)

               The sergeant takes out a pad. Now all three of them have 
               lists. He jots down Schindler's name. Schindler jots down 
               his and flips the pad closed.SCHINDLERSergeant, Mr. Tauber, thank you very 
                         much. I think I can guarantee you

                         evening.

               He walks away, back toward his car. The clerk and sergeant 
               smile. But slowly, slowly, the smiles sour at the possibility 
               that this man calmly walking away from them could somehow 
               arrange such a fate...ALL THREE OF THEM ---- Schindler, the clerk and the sergeant -- stride along the 
               side of the cars. Two of them are calling out loudly --CLERK & SERGEANTStern! Itzhak Stern!

               Soon it seems as if everybody except Schindler is yelling 
               out the name. As they reach the last few cars, the 
               accountant's face appears through the slats.SCHINDLERThere he is.SERGEANTOpen it.

               Guards yank at a lever, slide the gate open. Stern climbs 
               down. The clerk draws a line through his name on the list 
               and hands the clipboard to Schindler.CLERKInitial it, please.
                              (Schindler initials

               As Schindler signs three or four forms, the guards slide the 
               carriage gate closed. Those left inside seem grateful for 
               the extra space.CLERKIt makes no difference to us, you

                         It's the paperwork.

               Schindler returns the clipboard. The sergeant motions to 
               another who motions to the engineer. As the train pulls out, 
               Stern tries to keep up with Schindler who's striding away.STERNI somehow left my work card at home.

               Schindler turns away and heads for the car. Stern hurries 
               after him. They pass an area where all the luggage, carefully 
               tagged, has been left -- the image becoming BLACK and WHITE.EXT./INT. MECHANICS GARAGE - NIGHTMechanics' hood-lamps throw down pools of light through which

               The cart stops. A valise is handed to someone who dumps and 
               sorts the contents on a greasy table. The jewelry is taken

               lies nestled between two hills. The stone and brick buildings 
               look like they've been here forever; the wooden structures, 
               those that are up, are built of freshly-cut lumber.

               There's a great deal of activity. New construction and

               laid, fences and watchtowers going up, heavy segments of 
               huts -- wall panels, eaves sections -- being dragged uphill

               But then he's distracted by voices -- a man's, a woman's -- 
               arguing down where some barracks are being erected.

               The woman breaks off the dialog with a disgusted wave of her 
               hand and stalks back to a half-finished barracks. The man, 
               one from the car, Hujar, sees Goeth, Knude and Haase coming 
               down the hill and moves to meet them.HUJARShe says the foundation was poured

                         fucking hotel, fucking Jew engineer.

               Goeth watches the woman moving around the shell of the

               her the reason along with a shrug --GOETHYou argued with my man.

               Schindler smiles at the view, the beauty of it with the sun

               ghetto; Peace Square, the assembly of men and boys. He notices 
               a line of trucks rolling east across the Kosciuscko Bridge, 
               and another across the bridge at Podgorze, a third along

               rifle bursts no louder than caps. Dismounting, Schindler 
               moves closer to the edge of the hill, curious.

               Below, the ghetto lies like a void within the city, its

               Schindler clearly doesn't care, but nods as though he did.

               He drinks. Goeth just watches him with what seems to be 
               growing amusement. He nods to Hujar to continue.HUJARSince your labor is housed on-site,

               Schindler nods pensively, perhaps in agreement, perhaps at 
               some other thought. There's a silence, broken finally by --SCHINDLERI go to work the other day, there's

               Whatever tolerance Schindler's had up to this point with

               He discreetly hands over to the accountant some cigars

               foreman, nodding to this worker, wishing that one a good 
               morning. He seems satisfied, even pleased, with the level of 
               production. Goldberg is with him. They reach a particular 
               bench, a particular worker, and Goeth smiles pleasantly.GOETHWhat are you making?

               Not daring to look up, all the worker sees of Goeth is the 
               starched cuff of his shirt.LEVARTOVHinges, sir.

               The rabbi-turned-metalworker gestures with his head to a 
               pile of hinges on the floor. Goeth nods. And in a tone more 
               like a friend than anything else --GOETHI got some workers coming in

               He shrugs apologetically and pulls out a pocket watch.GOETHMake me a hinge.

               As Goeth times him, Rabbi Levartov works at making a hinge 
               as though his life depended on it -- which it does -- cutting 
               the pieces, wrenching them together, smoothing the edges, 
               all the while keeping count on his head of the seconds ticking 
               away.

               He understands perfectly. So does Levartov; he has just 
               crafted his own death in exactly 75 seconds. Goeth stands 
               him against the workshop wall and adjusts his shoulders. He

               He slams the weapon across Levartov's face and the rabbi 
               slumps dazed to the floor. Looking up into Goeth's face, he

               No one confesses. Goeth nods, All right, takes a rifle from 
               a guard and shoots one of the workers at random. With this 
               added incentive, he waits for someone to tell him who stole

               He shrugs, Okay, points the rifle at another worker -- and a 
               boy of fourteen, shuddering and weeping, steps out of line.GOETHThere we go.

               Goeth goes over to the boy, and, like a distant relative to 
               a small child, tries to get him to look at his face.GOETHIt was you? You committed this crime?BOYNo, sir.GOETHYou know who, though.

               The boy nods, weeps, screams --BOYHim!

               He's pointing at the dead man. And Goeth astonishes the entire

               But it isn't Stern who needs convincing; it's Schindler 
               himself. It's doubtful he even realizes this, but it's clear 
               to Stern. Schindler sighs either at the predicament itself, 
               or at the fact that he's allowed Stern to place him right in 
               the middle of it. He turns to leave, hesitates. He conducts 
               a mental search for a name and eventually comes up with it:SCHINDLERPerlman, husband and wife.

               he can barely stand up, stare out over Goeth's dark kingdom.SCHINDLERThey don't fear us because we have 
                         the power to kill, they fear us

                         it. Or we kill him ourselves and we 
                         feel even better. That's not power, 
                         though, that's justice. That's 
                         different than power. Power is when

                         the emperor, he throws himself down 
                         on the floor, he begs for mercy, he 
                         knows he's going to die... and the

               It seems almost as though this temptation toward restraint, 
               this image Schindler has brush-stroked of the merciful 
               emperor, holds some appeal to Goeth. Perhaps, as he stares 
               out over his camp, he imagines himself in the role, wondering

               Schindler.INT. UPSTAIRS OFFICES, D.E.F. - SAME TIME - DAYIn honor of Schindler's birthday, Goeth has brought over 
               Stern and the Rosners -- the musicians, at the moment, 
               accompanying the best baritone in the Ukrainian garrison.

               Surrounded by his friends and lovers, Schindler cuts a cake.

               He receives congratulations from the many SS men present and 
               the embraces, in turn, of Ingrid and Klonowska and Goeth.

               From Stern he gets a handshake.

               A Jewish girl from the shop floor is admitted and timidly 
               approaches the drunken group around Schindler. The SS men 
               consider her as a curiosity; Schindler, as he would any 
               beautiful girl. The music breaks and out of the silence comes 
               a small nervous voice:FACTORY GIRL...On behalf of the workers... sir... 
                         I wish you a happy birthday...

               She hesitates. She's surrounded by SS uniforms and swastikas 
               and holstered guns. Schindler smiles; this is a beautiful 
               girl.SCHINDLERThank you.

               He kisses her on the mouth. The smiles on the faces around 
               them strain. Stern glances to heaven. Amon cocks his head 
               like a confused dog. The kiss is broken, finally, and 
               Schindler smiles again with impunity.SCHINDLERThank them for me.

               The girl backs away nodding anxiously; all she wants now is 
               out before someone -- her, Schindler, both of them -- gets 
               shot. Henry Rosner nudges Leo and they begin another song.

               Other figures move around the parade ground in the murky

               the clerks.

               Some men in white appear like ghosts. A doctor's kid is

               A physician wipes at his brow with his handkerchief as several 
               prisoners run back and forth, naked, before him. He makes 
               his selections quickly: this one into this line, that one 
               into that, and Goldberg moves them recording the names.

               Other groups of people run naked in front of other doctors 
               and clerks. Notations are made and lines are formed. The sun

               Amon Goeth, his shirtsleeves uncharacteristically rolled up, 
               chats with one of the doctors as another group strips.

               Whether the topic is this Health Aktion or the unseasonable 
               weather is unclear, but he nods approvingly.PFEFFERBERG (O.S.)Commandant, sir.

               Goeth glances up, finds Poldek among the group taking off 
               their clothes. Pfefferberg appeals to him with a look that 
               asks, Do I really have to go through this, and Goeth turns 
               to a clerk.GOETHMy mechanic.

               Pfefferberg is motioned away from the others; he's okay, he

               Goeth thinks about it a moment before he nods, Yeah, okay,

               cars. Inside, those who "failed" the medical exams bake as 
               they wait for the last cars to be filled.

               Schindler's Mercedes pulls up. He climbs out and stares 
               transfixed. He notices Goeth then, standing with the other 
               industrialists, Bosch and Madritsch, and strolls over to 
               them.GOETHI tried to call you, I'm running a

               He glances away at the train. The idling engine only partially 
               covers the desperate pleas for water coming from inside the 
               slatted cars.GOETHThey're complaining now? They don't 
                         know what complaining is.

               He grins. Schindler watches as another car is loaded. It's 
               like they're climbing into an oven.SCHINDLERWhat do you say we get your fire

               Goeth stares at him blankly, then with a What-will-you-think-
               of-next? kind of look, then laughs uproariously and calls 
               over to Hujar --GOETHBring the fire trucks!HUJARWhat?

               Hujar heard him, he just doesn't get it. Finally he turns to 
               another guy and tells him to do it.

               STREAM OF WATER CASCADE onto the scalding rooftops. The fire 
               trucks are there, the hoses firing the cold water at the 
               cars on the people inside who are roaring their gratitude.GOETHThis is really cruel, Oskar, you're 
                         giving them hope. You shouldn't do 
                         that, that's cruel.

               And amusing, not just to Goeth, but to the other SS officers 
               standing around as well. Oskar moves away to talk with one 
               of the firemen. At full extension, apparently the hoses still 
               only reach halfway down the long line of cars. He returns to

               Goeth finds this especially sidesplitting, and hollers --GOETHHujar!

               THE D.E.F. HOSES have arrived and are being coupled to 
               Plaszow's. As the water drenches the cars further back, the 
               people inside loudly voice their thanks, and the guards and 
               officers outside grin at the spectacle.GUARDWhat does he think he's saving them

               The joke takes on new dimension when, from the back of the 
               D.E.F. trucks, boxes of food are unloaded. Accompanied by 
               the laughter of the SS, Schindler moves along the string of 
               cars pushing sausages through the slats.GOETHOh, my God.

               Goeth is almost hysterical. But slowly then, slowly, the 
               amusement on his face fades. His friend moving along the 
               cars bringing futile mercy to the doomed in front of countless 
               SS men, laughing or not, is not just behaving recklessly 
               here, it's as though he were possessed.

               The guys up front don't answer. Concern, for the first time,

               Schindler, incongruous with the dank surroundings in his 
               double-breasted suit, slowly paces back and forth before his 
               cellmate, a soldier who looks like he's been here forever,

               racial improprieties -- Amon Goeth. To an impassive SS colonel 
               behind a desk, Goeth tries to highlight extenuating 
               circumstances:GOETHHe likes women. He likes good-looking 
                         women. He sees a good-looking woman, 
                         he doesn't think. This guy has so 
                         many women. They love him. He's 
                         married, he's got all these women. 
                         All right, she was Jewish, he 
                         shouldn't have done it. But you didn't 
                         see this girl. I saw this girl. This 
                         girl was very good-looking.

               Goeth tries to read the guy behind the desk, but his face is 
               like a wall.GOETHThey cast a spell on you, you know, 
                         the Jews. You work closely with them 
                         like I do, you see this. They have 
                         this power, it's like a virus. Some 
                         of my men are infected with this 
                         virus. They should be pitied, not 
                         punished. They should receive 
                         treatment, because this is as real 
                         as typhus. I see this all the time.

               Goeth shifts in his chair; he knows he's not getting anywhere 
               with this guy. He switches tacts:GOETHIt's a matter of money? We can discuss 
                         that. That'd be all right with me.

               In the silence that follows, Goeth realizes he has made a 
               serious error in judgment. This man sitting soberly before 
               him is one of that rare breed -- the unbribable official.SS COLONELYou're offering me a bribe?GOETHA "bribe?" No, no, please come on... 
                         a gratuity.

               Suddenly the man stands up and salutes, which thoroughly 
               confuses Goeth since Goeth is his inferior in rank. But he 
               isn't saluting Goeth, he's saluting the officer who has just 
               stepped into the room behind him.SCHERNERSit down.

               The colonel sits back down. Scherner pulls up a chair next

               Scherner smiles and allows Goeth to shake his hand, but it's 
               clear, even to Goeth himself, that he has fallen from grace.INT. GOETH'S VILLA - PLASZOW - NIGHTA tall, thin, gray Waffen SS officer has a request for the 
               Rosner brothers.SS OFFICERI want to hear "Gloomy Sunday" again.

               He's drunk, morose; it seems unlikely he'll be on his feet 
               much longer. Indeed, as Henry and Leo Rosner begin the son -- 
               an excessively melancholy tale in which a young man commits 
               suicide for love -- the field officer staggers over to a 
               chair in the corner of the crowded room and slumps into it.SCHERNERWe give you Jewish girls at five 
                         marks a day, Oskar, you should kiss 
                         us, not them.

               Goeth laughs too loud, drawing a weary glance from Scherner.

               Schindler smiles good-naturedly. He's out, a little worse 
               for wear perhaps, a little more subdued than usual. Taking 
               him away from the others, taking him into his confidence --GOETHGod forbid you ever get a real taste 
                         for Jewish skirt. There's no future

                         future. And that's not just good old-
                         fashioned Jew-hating talk. It's policy 
                         now.

               THE THIN GRAY SS OFFICER is back in front of the musicians, 
               swaying precariously, a drink in his hand --SS OFFICER"Gloomy Sunday" again.

               Again they play the song. Again he staggers across the crowded 
               room to his chair in the corner, paying no attention to the 
               visiting Commandant from Treblinka or anybody else --TREBLINKA GUY-- We can process at Treblinka, if 
                         everything is working? I don't know, 
                         maybe two thousand units a day.

               He shrugs like it's nothing, or with modesty, it's unclear.

               Goeth is dully impressed; Schindler, only politely so.TREBLINKA GUYNow Auschwitz. Now you're talking. 
                         What I got is nothing, it's like 
                         a... a machine. Auschwitz, though, 
                         now there's a death factory. There, 
                         they know how to do it. There, they 
                         know what they're doing.

               AGAIN THE GRAY OFFICER wavering before Henry and Leo. This 
               time they don't wait for him to ask for it --LEO ROSNER"Gloomy Sunday" As the man stumbles back to his chair, the 
               Rosners not only play the song again, they play with it, and 
               him, this one somber man in the corner staring at them almost 
               gratefully, wrenching from the song all the sentimentality 
               they can, as if they could actually drive him to kill himself.

               No one else in the room is aware of the exchange going on 
               between them -- this man and this music -- which the brothers 
               play as if it were an invocation. Eventually, though, someone 
               does become aware, if not of the intention, at least of the 
               repetition, and interrupts the spell --GOETHEnough -- Jesus -- God --

               The music falls apart. The brothers find Goeth in the crowd 
               looking at them like, Come on, for Christ's sake play 
               something else. Which they do -- defeated -- some innocuous 
               Von Suppe. Goeth turns back to one of his guests.

               Glancing back, as they play, to the corner, the Rosners see 
               the gloomy SS officer getting slowly up from his chair. He 
               stands there for a moment, staring at nothing, then slowly 
               makes his way out onto the balcony where he stands in the 
               night air, absolutely still, in silhouette to the Rosners.

               And, ruining a perfectly good party, he takes out a gun and 
               shoots himself in the head.EXT. D.E.F. - DAYFrom a distance, Schindler can be seen arguing with an SS 
               officer who's trying to hand him papers, orders of some kind, 
               which the irate industrialist refuses to accept.

               Here, closer, carrying blankets and bundles, Schindler's 
               workers are marched under heavy guard out of the factory and 
               its annexes and across the fortified yard.

               His people are being taken. Where, is unclear. Schindler 
               abruptly breaks off the discussion with the SS man, climbs 
               into his car and drives off.EXT. FOREST - PLASZOW - LATER - DAYA creek flowing gently through marshy ground under an umbrella 
               of trees. Leo John and his five year old son, on their knees 
               catching tadpoles, seem unaware of, or at least not distracted 
               by, a ghastly endeavor going on beyond them:

               Bodies being exhumed out of the earth, out of the mass graves 
               in the forest. The dead lay everywhere, victims of the ghetto 
               massacre, victims of Plaszow.

               Arriving, Schindler sees Goeth standing up at the tree line.

               Approaching him, furious, he hesitates. He sees a wheelbarrow 
               trundled by Pfefferberg, a corpse in it. He fears the body 
               is Mila's, but then sees her trundling another barrow, another 
               corpse in it. Goeth calls to Schindler --GOETHCan you believe this?

               Goeth shakes his head, dismayed. Schindler joins him and 
               stares at a pyre of bodies built by masked and gagging 
               workers, layer upon layer.GOETHI'm trying to live my life, they

                         it?

               It's always something. He glances off. The pyre has reached 
               the height of a man's shoulder. The workers move around it

               Just before an empty train roars past from the other direction

               So often terrified by the sight of a clerk with a clipboard, 
               it is the absence of clerks which unsettles the woman now,

               "apparitions," skeletal figures which surround the two women, 
               or rather the soup pot between them, dipping little metal 
               cups into it, over and over.

               Too startled to speak, Mila can only stare. The apparitions 
               clamor around the pot a moment more, than furtively slip 
               back into the same darkness from which they came. Mila and

               at them, then at Schindler.HOSSYou're right, a clerical error has

               Why, because you get to know them? Because you begin to see 
               them as human beings? Schindler suddenly has the awful feeling

               list. As each woman steps out of line, a guard unceremoniously 
               brushes a swathe of red paint across her clothes. New columns 
               are formed.EXT. TRAIN YARD - AUSCHWITZ - DAYSchindler, standing at the end of the platform stone-faced, 
               watches the women whose names he is "stuck on," whose clothes 
               are slashed with red paint, climbing onto the cattle cars.

               As the cars fill, a train on another track arrives. The 
               "fresh" ones Schindler turned down. As the gates are closed 
               on the women's cars, the gates of the others are opened and 
               the people spill out.

               A horrified cry suddenly breaks through the noise of the 
               engines. One of Schindler's women, locked in, has seen her 
               son among those coming down off the train on the opposing 
               track.

               Another cry erupts, and another, another, as the women spot 
               their children, confiscated from the Brinnlitz factory, 
               brought here.

               Schindler becomes aware of what's happening and, passing 
               over other children, tries to corral these particular boys, 
               many of whom have noticed their mothers now and are echoing 
               their tortured cries with their own.

               Schindler manages to gather them together, the fifteen or 
               twenty boys, and, in the middle of the crowded platform, 
               appears to a guard:SCHINDLERThese are mine. They're on the list. 
                         These are my workers. They should be 
                         on the train.

               He points across to the women's train, then down to the boys.SCHINDLERThey're skilled munition workers. 
                         They're essential.

               The guard glances from the frantic gentleman to the anxious 
               brook around him. These are essential workers?GUARDThey're boys.SCHINDLERYes.

               Schindler is nodding his head, trying to think. The women 
               are shrieking their sons' names. The guard, who heard it 
               all, every excuse imaginable, is just turning away when 
               Schindler thrusts his smallest finger at him.SCHINDLERTheir fingers. They polish the insides

               The guard stares at him dumbly. This he hasn't heard.EXT. BRINNLITZ CAMP - DAYLike a mirage in the distance they appear -- the women, the 
               children, guards, Schindler, marching across a field toward 
               the factory.

               At the perimeter of the camp, at the wire, the men watch the 
               approaching procession. It appears to them that the women 
               are covered in blood -- or -- could it be paint? They're 
               walking, they're fine, some are even smiling.

               in full operation, finally; the people, having figured out 
               the complicated Hilos, turning out shells by the caseload.

               Schindler pauses at one of the machines.SCHINDLERHow's it going?WORKERGood. It's taken a while to calibrate

               crystal of one of the gauges.SCHINDLERThis isn't right, is it?

               The worker kneels down, takes a look. It looks right to him.

               Reaching over, Schindler changes the calibration of the 
               machine with a cavalier adjustment to a knob -- and all the 
               gauge readings shift.SCHINDLERThere. That looks right.

               He wanders off. The worker stares after him. He's just screwed 
               up settings that took weeks to get right.

               Schindler comes up to another worker, Levartov, the 
               hingemaker.

               He's at a machine buffing shells.SCHINDLERHow's it going, Rabbi?LEVARTOVGood, sir.

               gestures back to him, offering casually --SCHINDLERCome on.

               It sounds strange to Stern hearing Schindler actually say

               Stern allows himself a smile, a rare thing for him.

               Schindler carefully slips the new glasses onto the 
               accountant's face. He looks around the clinic, Stern, 
               eventually settling on Emilie, crystal clear, standing near 
               a picture on the wall which, in other circumstances, he'd

                         quality-control tests.

               Schindler nods soberly. Then dismisses the problem with a

                         have to understand. These are start-

                         where we can buy shells and buy them. 
                         We'll pass them off as ours.

               Stern's not sure he sees the logic. Whether the shells are 
               manufactured here or elsewhere, they'll still eventually 
               reach their intended destination, into the hearts and heads 
               of Germany's enemies.STERNI know what you're saying, but I

               That's another difference. The main one. The only one

               hit by a stray bullet when Liepold fires on the boy -- which 
               seems a certainty -- scramble out of the way.SCHINDLER (O.S.)Hey.

               Liepold swings the gun around at the voice, pointing it for 
               a moment at Schindler, who is striding toward him, then aims 
               the barrel back at the boy's head, and yells --LIEPOLDDepartment W does not forbid my 
                         presence on the factory floor. That 
                         is a lie.

               He waves a document at Schindler, throws it at him.

               Schindler doesn't bother picking it up. Instead, pointing at 
               the boy, he yells to Liepold --SCHINDLERShoot him. Shoot him!

               a blast stretch out, both and Schindler begin to settle down.LIEPOLDHe sabotaged the machine.

               Schindler glances to the boy. Then at the silent Hilo beside 
               him. Part of it is blackened from an electrical fire. To the 
               boy, concerned --SCHINDLERThe machine's broken?

               The boy, too terrified to speak, nods.LIEPOLDThe prisoner is under the jurisdiction

               Liepold glances to him. He seems almost distraught by the

               Liepold isn't sure that's correct, but he has no 
               documentation, at least not on him, to refute it.INT. FACTORY - NIGHTIn the machine-tool section, a "judicial table" has been set 
               up. At it sit Schindler, Liepold, two other SS officers, and 
               an attractive German girl, a stenographer. The "saboteur," 
               the boy, Janek, stands before the court.JANEKI'm unfamiliar with the Hilo machines. 
                         I don't know why I was assigned there.

               Commandant Liepold was watching me trying to figure it out.

               did was turn it on.

               Gone tonight is Schindler's usual shop-floor familiarity. He 
               studies the boy solemn-faced.SCHINDLERIf you're not skilled at armaments 
                         work, you shouldn't be here.JANEKI'm a lathe operator.

               Schindler dismisses the defensive comment with a wave of his 
               hand and gets up. He comes around and paces slowly before 
               the boy. Eventually, Janek dares to speak again --JANEKSir?

               Schindler glances up at him distractedly.JANEKI did adjust the pressure controls.

               Schindler stops, looks to the panel, and back to the boy.SCHINDLERWhat?JANEKI know that much about them. Somebody

               Schindler slams the back of his hand so hard across Janek's 
               face, the boy almost falls. He's stunned. So are the others 
               at the table. They've never seen such violence from the 
               Direktor. He roars --SCHINDLERThe stupidity of these people. I

                         a machine.

               Schindler's hand comes up again and Janek recoils, expecting 
               another blow. Schindler manages to hold it.SCHINDLERGet him out of my sight.

               Stern stares up, puzzled. He locates a ladder that connects 
               the shop-floor to a series of overhead planks and, with 
               trepidation, climbs.

               He reaches a shaky landing high above the machines, navigates

               Above the rim of the tank, amid rising steam, Schindler's

               on the tank, reaches the top and finds inside, lolling in 
               the steaming water, Schindler and the blonde stenographer

               Stern glances away, doesn't answer, just stares off. And a 
               slight, slight smile, a gambler's philosophical smile upon 
               being purged of his wealth, appears on Schindler's face.EXT. RURAL BRINNLITZ - DAYIn the distance, a lone boxcar, stark against the winter

               Around the abandoned boxcar, in the gruesome cold, stand 
               Schindler, Emilie, a doctor, some workers and some SS guards, 
               watching, waiting.

               Pfefferberg steps back. Sledge hammers pound at locks.

               Hands pull at levers. The doors begin to slide.

               Out of darkness, from inside the boxcar as the doors slide 
               open, Schindler's face is revealed, tight. He stares for an 
               interminable moment before walking slowly away.

               Inside the boxcar is a tangle of limbs, a pyramid of corpses, 
               frozen white.

               From a distance, a tableau: the boxcar, the workers and guards 
               and Emilie outside it, Schindler, off to himself several

                         in my furnaces. As a Catholic I will 
                         not. As a human being I will not.

               The priest nods; he seems relatively empathic. He offers an 
               alternative --PRIESTThere's an area beyond the church 
                         reserved for the burial of suicides.

                         there.SCHINDLERThese aren't suicides.

               The priest knows that. But he also knows that the provisions

               The roar of a machine suddenly, inexplicably, dies. Then 
               another. And another. Schindler, standing at the main power

               factory again carrying the suitcase, Schindler at his side, 
               steering him to some degree.

               Goeth's hand comes up to his cheek as if to brush away a 
               bothersome fly. But it isn't a fly. One of the workers has 
               spit on him. He turns in disbelief.

               Silence as his hand drops to his side, to the holster he 
               forgets isn't there. He glances around for SS guards... who 
               aren't there. He looks to Schindler, thoroughly confused, 
               and whispers --GOETHWhere are the guards?SCHINDLERThe guards aren't allowed on the 
                         factory floor. They make my workers 
                         nervous.

               Goeth stares at him bewildered. Then again at the worker who 
               spit. Then at other workers, the resolve in their eyes.

               They know he has no power here, and sense he has no power 
               anywhere. His own eyes drift to a woman with yarn in her 
               lap, knitting needles in her hands. Is this a dream?SCHINDLERI'll discipline him later.

               Schindler good-naturedly throws an arm around Goeth's shoulder 
               and leads him away. The workers watch as the two Germans 
               disappear out the factory doors.INT. GUARDS' BARRACKS - EVENINGA guard slowly turns the dial of a radio, finding and losing 
               in static several different voices in several languages, 
               none of them lasting more than a moment.

               Depression hangs over the barracks. Most of the guards are 
               straining to hear the news they've been fearing for some 
               time now, some on their bunks just staring, one at a window 
               peering out at the black face of a forest as if expecting,

                         factory.

               He turns and walks away.INT. BRINNLITZ FACTORY - NIGHTAll twelve hundred workers and all the guards are gathered 
               for the first time on the factory floor. Tension and 
               uncertainty surround them. It's ominously quiet. Then --SCHINDLERThe unconditional surrender of Germany 
                         has just been announced. At midnight 
                         tonight the war is over.

               It is not his intention to elicit celebration. Indeed, his 
               words, echoing and fading in the factory, echo the doubts 
               they all feel.SCHINDLERTomorrow, you'll begin the process 
                         of looking for survivors of your 
                         families. In many cases you won't 
                         find them. After six long years of 
                         murder, victims are being mourned 
                         throughout the world.

               Not by Untersturmfuhrer Liepold. He stands with his men, 
               dying to lift his rifle and fire.SCHINDLERWe've survived. Some of you have 
                         come up to me and thanked me. Thank 
                         yourselves. Thank your fearless Stern, 
                         and others among you, who, worrying 
                         about you, have faced death every 
                         moment.
                              (glancing away)
                         Thank you.

               He's looking at the guards, thanking them, which thoroughly 
               confuses the workers. Just when they thought they knew where 
               his sentiments lay, he's thanking guards.SCHINDLERYou've shown extraordinary discipline. 
                         You've behaved humanely here. You 
                         should be proud.

               Or is he attempting to adjust reality, to destroy the SS as 
               combatants, to alter the self-image of both the guards and 
               the prisoners? Moving across the SS men's faces, they remain 
               inscrutable. Schindler turns his attention back to the 
               workers, and, not at all like a confession, but rather like 
               simple statements of fact:SCHINDLERI'm a member of the Nazi party. I'm 
                         a munitions manufacturer. I'm a 
                         profiteer of slave labor, I'm a 
                         criminal. At midnight, you will be 
                         free and I will be hunted.
                              (pause)
                         I'll remain with you until five 
                         minutes after midnight After which 
                         time, and I hope you'll forgive me, 
                         I have to flee.

               That worries the workers. Whenever he leaves, something 
               terrible always seems to happen.SCHINDLERIn memory of the countless victims 
                         among your people, I ask us to observe 
                         three minutes of silence.

               In the quiet, in the silence, drifting slowly across the 
               faces of the workers -- the elderly, the lame, teenagers, 
               wives beside husbands, children beside their parents, families 
               together -- it becomes clear, if it wasn't before, that both 
               as a prison and a manufacturing enterprise, the Brinnlitz 
               camp has been one long sustained confidence game.

               Schindler has never stood still so long in his life. He does 
               now, though, framed by his giant Hilo machines, silent at 
               the close of the noisiest of wars, his head bowed, mourning 
               the many dead.

               When he finally does look up he sees that he is the last to 
               do so. The faces, few of which he recognizes, are all looking 
               at him. He turns to speak to the guards along the wall again.SCHINDLERI know you've received orders from 
                         our Commandant -- which he has 
                         received from his superiors -- to 
                         dispose of the population of this 
                         camp.

               Apprehension spreads across the factory like a wave.

               Pfefferberg tightens his grip on the pistol under his coat.

               His ragtag irregulars do the same, the rest of their ersatz 
               "arsenal" concealed behind a machine. To the guards:SCHINDLERNow would be the time to do it. 
                         They're all here. This is your 
                         opportunity.

               The guards hold their weapons, as they have from the moment 
               they arrived here tonight, at attention, waiting it seems, 
               to be given the official order from their Commander, Liepold, 
               who appears ready to give it.SCHINDLEROr...
                              (he shrugs)

                         your families as men instead of 
                         murderers.

               Long, long silence. Finally, one of the guards slowly lowers 
               his rifle, breaks ranks and walks away. Then another. And 
               another. And another. Another.

               When the last is gone, the workers consider Liepold. He 
               appears more an oddity than a threat. He is more an oddity 
               than a threat. And he knows it. He turns and leaves.EXT. BRINNLITZ CAMP - NIGHTA watchtower. Abandoned. The perimeter wire. No sentries.

               a small suitcase. In the dark, some distance away from his 
               Mercedes, stand all twelve hundred workers. As Schindler and 
               his wife cross the courtyard to the car, Stern and Levartov 
               approach. The rabbi hands him some papers.LEVARTOVWe've written a letter trying to 
                         explain things. In case you're 
                         captured. Every worker has signed 
                         it.

               Schindler sees a list of signatures beginning below the 
               typewritten text and continuing for several pages. He pockets 
               it, this new list of names.SCHINDLERThank you.

               Stern steps forward and places a ring in Schindler's hand.

               It's a gold band, like a wedding ring. Schindler notices an 
               inscription inside it.STERNIt's Hebrew. It says, 'Whoever saves 
                         one life, saves the world.'

               Schindler slips the ring onto a finger, admires it a moment, 
               nods his thanks, then seems to withdraw.SCHINDLER(to himself)

               Stern isn't sure he heard right. Schindler steps away from

               Schindler starts to lose it, the tears coming. Stern, too.

               The look on Schindler's face as his eyes sweep across the 
               faces of the workers is one of apology, begging them to 
               forgive him for not doing more.SCHINDLERThis car. Goeth would've bought this

               back into the forest.EXT. BRINNLITZ CAMP - SAME TIME - NIGHTFrom a watchtower, a couple of workers, having witnessed the 
               tank's display of impotent might, can make little sense of 
               it. Below, many of the workers mill around the yard, waiting 
               to be liberated. No one seems to know what else to do.EXT. BRINNLITZ - DAYSome Czech partisans emerge from the forest. They come down

               the hill and casually approach the camp. Reaching the wire, 
               they're met by Pfefferberg and some other workers, rifles 
               slung over their shoulders. Through the fence --PARTISANIt's all over.PFEFFERBERGWe know.PARTISAN(pause)
                         So what are you doing? You're free 
                         to go home.PFEFFERBERGWhen the Russians arrive. Until then 
                         we're staying here.

               The partisan shrugs, Suit yourself, and wanders back toward 
               the trees with his friends.EXT. BRINNLITZ CAMP - NIGHTFive headlights appear out of the night, five motorcycles 
               marked with the SS Death's-head insignia. They turn onto the 
               road leading to the camp gate and park, the riders shutting 
               off the engines.SS NCOHello?

               Shapes materialize out of the darkness within the camp.

               Several armed and dangerous Jews.EXT. BRINNLITZ CAMP - LATER - NIGHTAs the cyclists fill their tanks with gasoline borrowed from 
               the camp, the workers keep their rifles pointed at them. The 
               NCO in charge lines the gas cans neatly back up against the 
               wire.NCO IN CHARGEThank you very much.

               He climbs onto his motorcycle. The others climb onto theirs.

               And drive away.EXT. BRINNLITZ CAMP - DAWNA lone Russian officer on horseback, tattered coat, rope for 
               reins, emerges from the forest. As he draws nearer, it becomes 
               apparent to the workers assembling on the camp yard, that 
               the horse is a mere pony, the Russian's feet in stirrups 
               nearly touching the ground beneath the animal's skinny 
               abdomen.

               He reaches the camp, climbs easily down from the horse and, 
               in a loud voice, addresses the hundreds of workers standing 
               at the fence:RUSSIANYou have been liberated by the Soviet 
                         Army.

               This is it? This one man? The workers wait for him to say 
               more. He waits for them to move, to leave, to go home. Finally --RUSSIANWhat's wrong?

               A few of the workers come out from behind the fence to talk 
               with him.WORKERHave you been in Poland?RUSSIANI just came from Poland.WORKERAre there any Jews left?

               The Russian has to think. Eventually he shrugs, 'no,' not 
               that he saw, and climbs back onto his pony to leave.WORKERWhere should we go?RUSSIANI don't know. Don't go east, that's 
                         for sure, they hate you there.
                              (pause)
                         I wouldn't go west either if I were 
                         you.

               He shrugs and gives his little horse a kick in the ribs.WORKERWe could use some food.

               The Russian looks confused, glances off. The quiet hamlet of 
               Brinnlitz sits there against the mountains not half a mile 
               away.RUSSIANIsn't that a town over there?

               Of course it is. But the idea that they could simply walk 
               over there is completely foreign to them. The Russian rides 
               away.EXT. BRINNLITZ - DAYAll twelve hundred of them, a great moving crowd coming 
               forward, crosses the land laying between the camp, behind 
               them, and the town, in front of them.

               Tight on the FACE of one of the MEN.

               Tight on TYPEWRITER KEYS rapping his NAME.

               the crowd.

               Tight on the face of a woman in the moving crowd. The keys 
               typing her name. The pen scratching out "LATHE OPERATOR." 
               The keys typing "PHYSICIAN." Tight on her face.

               neighborhood of the city.INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DUSKThe door to a modest apartment opens revealing Oskar 
               Schindler. The elegant clothes are gone but the familiar 
               smile remains.SCHINDLERHey, how you doing?

               It's Poldek Pfefferberg out in the hall.PFEFFERBERGGood. How's it going?SCHINDLERThings are great, things are great.

               Things don't look so great. Schindler isn't penniless, but 
               he's not far from it, living alone in the one room behind 
               him.PFEFFERBERGWhat are you doing?SCHINDLERI'm having a drink, come on in, we'll 
                         have a drink.PFEFFERBERGI mean where have you been? Nobody's 
                         seen you around for a while.SCHINDLER(puzzled)
                         I've been here. I guess I haven't 
                         been out.PFEFFERBERGI thought maybe you'd like to come 
                         over, have some dinner, some of the 
                         people are coming over.SCHINDLERYeah? Yeah, that'd be nice, let me 
                         get my coat.

               Pfefferberg waits out in the hall as Schindler disappears 
               inside for a minute. The legend below appears:AMON GOETH WAS ARRESTED AGAIN, WHILE A PATIENT IN ANSANITARIUM AT BAD TOLZ. GIVING THE NATIONAL SOCIALIST SALUTE,HE WAS HANGED IN CRACOW FOR CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY.Schindler reappears wearing a coat, steps out into the hall, 
               forgets something, turns around and goes back in.OSKAR SCHINDLER FAILED AT SEVERAL BUSINESSES, AND MARRIAGE,AFTER THE WAR IN 1958, HE WAS DECLARED A RIGHTEOUS PERSON BYTHE COUNCIL OF THE YAD VASHEM IN JERUSALEM, AND INVITED TOPLANT A TREE IN THE AVENUE OF THE RIGHTEOUS. IT GROWS THERESTILL.He comes back out with a nice bottle of wine in his hand, 
               and, as he and Pfefferberg disappear down the stairs together --SCHINDLER'S VOICEMila's good?PFEFFERBERG'S VOICEShe's good.SCHINDLER'S VOICEKids are good? Let's stop at a store 
                         on the way so I can buy them 
                         something.PFEFFERBERG'S VOICEThey don't need anything. They just 
                         want to see you.SCHINDLER'S VOICEYeah, I know. I'd like to pick up 
                         something for them. It'll only take 
                         a minute.

               Their voices face. Against the empty hallway appears a faint 
               trace of the image of the factory workers, through the wire, 
               walking away from the Brinnlitz camp. And the legend:THERE ARE FEWER THAN FIVE THOUSAND JEWS LEFT ALIVE IN POLANDTODAY. THERE ARE MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND DESCENDANTS OF THESCHINDLER JEWS.THE END
