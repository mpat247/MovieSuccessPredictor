               woman making love. Photograph shakes. SOUND of a man MOANING 
               in anguish. The photograph is dropped, REVEALING ANOTHER, 
               MORE compromising one. Then another, and another. More moans.CURLY'S VOICE(crying out)
                         Oh, no.INT. GITTES' OFFICECURLY drops the photos on Gittes' desk. Curly towers over 
               GITTES and sweats heavily through his workman's clothes, his 
               breathing progressively more labored. A drop plunks on Gittes' 
               shiny desk top.

               Gittes notes it. A fan whiffs overhead. Gittes glances up at 
               it. He looks cool and brisk in a white linen suit despite 
               the heat. Never taking his eyes off Curly, he lights a 
               cigarette using a lighter with a "nail" on his desk.

               Curly, with another anguished sob, turns and rams his fist 
               into the wall, kicking the wastebasket as he does. He starts 
               to sob again, slides along the wall where his fist has left 
               a noticeable dent and its impact has sent the signed photos 
               of several movie stars askew.

               Curly slides on into the blinds and sinks to his knees. He 
               is weeping heavily now, and is in such pain that he actually 
               bites into the blinds.

               Gittes doesn't move from his chair.GITTESAll right, enough is enough. You 
                         can't eat the Venetian blinds, Curly. 
                         I just had 'em installed on Wednesday.

               Curly responds slowly, rising to his feet, crying. Gittes 
               reaches into his desk and pulls out a shot glass, quickly 
               selects a cheaper bottle of bourbon from several fifths of 
               more expensive whiskeys.

               Gittes pours a large shot. He shoves the glass across his 
               desk toward Curly.GITTESDown the hatch.

               Curly stares dumbly at it. Then picks it up, and drains it. 
               He sinks back into the chair opposite Gittes, begins to cry 
               quietly.CURLY(drinking, relaxing a

               Gittes leaves the bottle with Curly.GITTESYou're absolutely right, I wouldn't

               There is the SOUND of ANOTHER MOAN coming from Gittes' Office.

               Something made of glass shatters. The Woman grows more edgy.INT. GITTES' OFFICE � GITTES & CURLYGittes and Curly stand in front of the desk, Gittes staring 
               contemptuously at the heavy breathing hulk towering over 
               him. Gittes takes a handkerchief and wipes away the plunk of 
               perspiration on his desk.CURLY(crying)
                         They don't kill a guy for that.GITTESOh they don't?CURLYNot for your wife. That's the 
                         unwritten law.

               Gittes pounds the photos on the desk, shouting;GITTESI'll tell you the unwritten law, you 
                         dumb son of a bitch, you gotta be

               Curly shrinks back a little.CURLY...No...GITTESYou bet your ass you don't. You can't 
                         even pay me off.

               This seems to upset Curly even more.CURLYI'll pay the rest next trip. We only

               Gittes pulls up a chair sitting next to Mrs. Mulwray between 
               Duffy and Walsh. Duffy cracks his gum.

               Gittes gives him an irritated glance. Duffy stops chewing.MRS. MULWRAYCan't we talk about this alone, Mr.

               There he reaches through the window and pulls out a roll of 
               blueprints or something like them. He spreads them on the

               in time to see Mulwray scramble adroitly down the side of 
               the cliff to the beach below. Be seems in a hurry. Gittes 
               moves after him, having a little more difficulty negotiating

               crescent.

               apparent Mulwray has gone that way. Gittes hesitates, then

               Mulwray stands and stares at the water, apparently fascinated. 
               Even as Gittes watches Mulwray watching, the volume and

               Gittes stops and gets out of the car. Several men with their

               around. He's a tall, sleek Mexican in his early thirties,LUIS ESCOBAR.Both Gittes and Escobar register considerable surprise at

               the channel with the car spotlight. He turns at a fork in 
               the road which allows him to continue following the flood 
               channel.FURTHER UP � MOVINGThe road is narrower. Gittes drives more slowly. Foliage is 
               overgrown in the channel so its bottom cannot be glimpsed.STILL FURTHER � NIGHTThe road is dirt. Heavy clusters of oak trees and eucalyptus

               and down into it, making access along the channel itself 
               impossible.

               Gittes backs up, turns off the motor, the car lights, the 
               spotlight.

               A lone light overhead on tension wires is the sole 
               illumination.

               There is only the eerie SOUND of the tension WIRES HUMMING.

               Gittes gets out of the car, clubs the fence near the Flood

               toward a second and large chain-link fence. Lights from the 
               reservoir still higher above can be SEEN.

               Suddenly there is a GUNSHOT. Then ANOTHER. Gittes dives into 
               the flood control channel, which is at this point about four 
               feet deep and six feet wide. There is the SOUND of men 
               scurrying through the brush, coming near him, then retreating. 
               Gittes loses himself among the ivy in the channel.

               He waits. The men seem to have passed him by. But there is 
               another SOUND now. An echoing growing sound. It puzzles 
               Gittes. He starts to lift his head to catch the direction.GITTES IN FLOOD CONTROL CHANNEL � NIGHTThen he's inundated with a rush of water which pours over 
               him, knocks off his hat, carries him down the channel, banging 
               into its banks, as he desperately tries to grab some of the 
               overgrowth to hang on and pull himself out. But the force of 
               the stream batters him and carries him with it until he's 
               brought rudely to the chainlink fence. It stops him cold. 
               He's nearly strained through it.

               Swearing and choking, he pulls himself out of the rushing 
               water by means of the fence itself.

               Drenched, battered, he slowly climbs back over the fence and

               With a quick flick the Smaller Man pulls back on the blade, 
               laying Gittes' left nostril open about an inch further. Gittes 
               screams.

               Blood gushes down onto his shirt and coat.

               Coming INTO VIEW above the arid fields is a spiraling cloud 
               of purple smoke. Gittes heads in that direction.

               Gittes parks at the edge of the field. About twenty yards 
               away is a man mounted on a strange machine, holding a lid 
               off it.

               Gittes takes this fork and begins a slow ascent.

               As he does, the tops of a line of bright green trees can be 
               SEEN, coming more and more INTO VIEW, row upon row of avocado

               Towering above it all is a huge wooden water tank.

               Gittes drives through a gate that has "NO TRESPASSING" and

               down the field in the direction he had just driven is a Red-

               not, however, lose the shotgun he has just used. Gittes' 
               lane of retreat is denied him. He guns the car, and takes 
               off down one of the orchard lanes.MOVING WITH GITTESThe dirt lane is rough. As Gittes nears the end of it, a 
               Younger Man on a mule blocks the exit.

               Gittes veers a sharp left, knocking a branch off one of the 
               trees, heading down one of the cross-lanes. Here he's pursued 
               by a scraggly dog that nips at the tires. Gittes yells at

               toward a dust trail rising above the trees. They've spotted

               This hide-and-seek chase between one man on horseback, one 
               on a mule and a couple on foot continues up and down and 
               across the orchard lanes until Gittes' front tire and radiator 
               are ruptured by another SHOTGUN BLAST.

               Gittes' car veers off, scattering a stray gaggle of geese 
               and smacks into an avocado tree, shaking loose a barrage of 
               the heavy fruit onto Gittes and the car.

               Gittes immediately tries to get out through the branches 
               over the back of his car, but he's pulled off it by one of 
               the younger farmers, a huge brute who he begins to tussle 
               with. The Crippled Farmer begins to bang Gittes on the back 
               with his crutch. The two of them manage to pound Gittes to

               of opening the glass door in the entryway, putting his back

               and kicks it.

               It goes flying down the hall, at least thirty feet; hits the

               on up the walkway to the front door.DOWN THE STREET � GITTES IN BUICKIdles the engine with the lights off. He brings the car a 
               few yards further down the street, parking it near Evelyn's.

               Gittes gets out of the car and goes up the walkway. The 
               curtains are drawn except for one of the small windows on 
               the side of the house.

               He goes to it and looks, balancing on the edge of the porch.THROUGH THE WINDOWGittes sees Evelyn's Oriental servant rush through the living 
               room of the small house. In a moment he re-emerges back 
               through the living room carrying a tray with a glass and 
               pitcher on it.GITTESAround to the side of the house. He runs into shrubbery and 
               a short picket fence.

               He climbs over it, follows along the stucco wall to a series 
               of windows at the corner of the house. These all have shades 
               on them.

               He can hear someone crying in the house. Someone else talking 
               alternately firmly and plaintively in Spanish. Here the 
               windows have blinds. He moves to one where the blind is not 
               completely drawn.

               There's an inch or so of space at the bottom.THROUGH THE WINDOWGittes can see the servant again. Evelyn is pacing back and 
               forth in and out of his line of vision. After a moment someone 
               rises INTO SHOT, obviously from lying on a bed. The figure 
               is just a few feet from Evelyn. Her tear-stained face comes 
               INTO VIEW. It is unmistakably the girl Gittes had last seen 
               with Hollis Mulwray.

               Mulwray's girlfriend. She's looking up to Evelyn, speaking 
               in Spanish. Her words are not discernible but the tone is 
               bitter, anguished. A newspaper is strewn about the room.

               Evelyn kneels. She insists that the girl swallow down some 
               pills.

               The girl reluctantly does.GITTESContinues to watch.EXT. STREET � EVELYN � NIGHTEmerges from the house, goes to her car and gets in.INT. CAREvelyn sees Gittes sitting in her car, staring coldly at

               Gittes starts to get out of the car. Evelyn grabs his arm, 
               nearly screaming:EVELYNNo!

               Her intensity actually rips Gittes' already partially torn 
               jacket.

               He looks at it and her. It seems to have a momentary calming 
               effect on both of them.EVELYN(continuing)

               Gittes explodes.GITTESJust tell me the truth. I'm not the 
                         police. I don't care what you've 
                         done. I'm not going to hurt you, but

                         you?GITTESI will if you don't.

               A long pause. Evelyn's head sinks onto the steering wheel, 
               her hair covering her face.EVELYNShe's my sister.

               Evelyn is breathing very deeply now. Not crying, but the 
               kind of deep breathing that comes from real hysteria. Gittes 
               puts an arm on her shoulder.GITTESTake it easy... If it's your sister

               table. Gittes moves toward it. It is grotesque. When he gets 
               closer he can see it's a wilted head of lettuce. Just inside 
               the kitchen some radishes and onions lie on the linoleum.

               Ice cream has melted around her. Her eyes are open, a stream 
               of ants is moving across the ice cream and into her mouth. 
               She's recognizable as the woman who posed as Evelyn Mulwray.

               Gittes kneels over her. He gingerly opens her handbag, fishes 
               for its contents, takes them and looks at them on the kitchen

               holds a pair of eye glasses, rimless, bent, his finger poking 
               through the frame where one lens is shattered.
