                                       John Monk SaundersFADE INEXT. BATTLEFIELD - NIGHTOn a FREEZE FRAME of a huge mortar on the edge of a dismal no-man's land, 
          surrounded by trees and overhanging branches. The distant roar of battle 
          RUMBLES ominously. SUPERIMPOSED TITLES appear and hold for a moment.Abruptly, the image springs to life. The gun FIRES deafeningly. The nearby 
          branches shake violently. Another set of TITLES appears. The image FREEZES 
          again as a lone bugle plays a charge. Again and again and again, the image 
          moves, the gun DISCHARGES noisily, the image FREEZES and more sets of TITLES 
          appear with every FIRING.On the last discharge, the trumpet fades and all hell breaks loose:WAR MONTAGENothing but FAST, BRUTAL FLASH CUTS of:Cannon firing in all directions.Massive explosions on the battlefield that light up the night.Troops marching across a bridge as a shell hits the river below sending water 
          towering into the sky.An entire cavalry division galloping hard over the battlefield, blazing mortar 
          fire visible above them on the horizon.Brief shots of the horses, their grim riders hanging on for dear life, their 
          muscles flexing, hooves pounding the dirt. Men yelling.FASTER AND FASTER, MORE AND MORE CHAOTIC:Mortar fire, explosions, smoke.A machine gunner fires.A soldier falls.Infantrymen, rifles in hand, press through the haze.More machine gunning.More soldiers go down.A massive gun fires.SMASH CUT of a tank tread bearing down on the CAMERA, blacking out the screen.Infantrymen trail behind the heavy machinery, firing pistols, rifles.A bridge explodes. A building explodes. The ground explodes.A bomb drops from an airplane.Aerial view of an exploding building.Anti-aircraft guns at work.Planes in the air.A machine gun fires skyward.Planes circle, filling the air.A single bi-plane.The plane's gunner, SHEP LAMBERT, looks down, surveys the situation, breaks 
          into a grin.Shep nudges his pilot, CARY LOCKWOOD, and points. Cary looks down to see:Another plane below. In it, pilot BILL TALBOT waves and salutes. FRANCIS, the 
          gunner, opens his mouth, smiles and nods up at them.An enemy plane arrives.The enemy pilot fires his twin machine guns.Bill and Francis' plane spins away.Bill cocks a snook at the enemy plane and waves dismissively at it, much to 
          Francis' amusement.The planes circle in the air.The enemy plane trails Shep and Cary. Shep FIRES his machine gun to no avail 
          as Cary watches.The enemy pilot returns fire.The two planes tango in mid-air.Shep FIRES.The enemy pilot grins and FIRES.Bullet holes riddle the side of Shep and Cary's plane.Cary warns Shep they've been hit.From the enemy plane's POV, Shep and Cary's plane streams black smoke.The two planes. Shep and Cary's plane goes into a steep dive, spinning out of 
          control.Cary rips off his goggles as smoke pours up from below him.Flames fill the cockpit as Cary's gloved hands desperately try to keep hold of 
          the red hot controls.The plane, streaming smoke, spins wildly downward.Shep, surrounded with smoke, looks skyward and salutes with mock gallantry.Above, Bill and Francis watch. Bill returns the salute with a smile and waves. 
          Francis, though, doesn't look happy.Shep twists in his seat and looks around.Cary's hands grasp the controls in the flaming cockpit.SHEP (o.s.)
          		Level off, Cary! Level off!Despite the flames, Cary pulls back on the control stick.From the plane's POV: The landscape rushes by.The plane, now level, crashes into the ground and comes to an abrupt stop.Smoke. Flames.Cary jumps out of the cockpit and rushes back to Shep who is struggling to 
          clamber out.CARYShep! Shep, are you all right?SHEPCan't make it, Cary. Can't make it.CARYHere, give me your arm! I'll get 
          		you out of here! Hang on there, 
          		Shep! Get a hold - Just hold tight, 
          		old fella.Cary pulls Shep out and hauls him away from the burning wreckage where the two 
          of them collapse to the ground, half-conscious.Flames consume the plane.DISSOLVE TO:A TEMPERATURE CHARTfor Lieutenant Shep Lambert, a patient at U.S. Army A.E.F. Base Hospital 145. 
          Shep's temperature readings for October 11th to October 26th are indicated by 
          a line on a graph, near a level marked CRITICAL. The distant sound of battle 
          continues to RUMBLE.ANOTHER CHARTswings into view. This one is for Lieutenant Cary Lockwood whose readings for 
          October 27th to November 2nd are also below the CRITICAL mark. The line 
          continues and improves considerably by November 11th when the final reading is 
          marked NORMAL.DISSOLVE TO:INT. HOSPITAL - DAYThe battle sounds are now joined by a loudly TICKING clock. With no sign of
          energy or emotion, Shep and Cary sit together on a hospital cot in full 
          uniform. Shep wears dark eyeglasses. Cary has a coat draped over his hands. He 
          glances off. We follow his gaze, PANNING past other patients in the hospital 
          to a wall clock and calendar. It is November 11th and the time is almost 
          eleven A. M. The battle's RUMBLE drones on.SHEP AND CARYstare up at the clock. Behind his dark glasses, Shep's left eye twitches.THE CLOCKslowly DISSOLVES to one last BRIEF BATTLE MONTAGE: soldiers yelling and 
          running, guns firing noisily, a plane crashing, explosions. The final image is 
          of a plane parked on the ground, its engine dying, its propeller slowing to a 
          stop as we DISSOLVE BACK TO the clock face. The center of the clock is lined 
          up exactly with the center of the propeller -- the slowing propeller blades 
          are replaced by the clock's hands -- as if to symbolically suggest that the 
          war has ended but time goes on. The NOISE of battle fades and only the TICKING 
          of the clock remains. DISSOLVE TO the calendar: November 11th, 1918 -- 
          Armistice Day.SHEP AND CARYsit motionless side-by-side on the cot. Shep has a hand over his left eye.CARYWell, the old guerre is finie.SHEPThat's right.CARYWhat are ya gonna do now, Shep?SHEPGet tight.CARY(turns to him)
          		And then what?Shep lets go of his eye and looks at Cary as if the answer were obvious.SHEPStay tight.Cary grins wryly.CUT TO:INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NOT LONG AFTERA nurse opens a door for Shep and Cary who enter. Shep wears his dark glasses. 
          Cary carries his coat to hide his hands. They pause as the doors they have 
          passed through close behind them.Their distinguished-looking doctor, a medical officer with a white gown over 
          his uniform, sits at his desk studying their papers.DOCTORLieutenants Lambert and Lockwood. 
          			(rises, joins them)
          		You two leaving us, eh? In a way, 
          		I'm sorry to release you two. I have 
          		no choice in the matter.Shep removes his glasses and presses his hand to his eye.SHEPWhat am I going to do, Major, about 
          		my-- oh, this rotten business?The doctor examines Shep's eye more closely.DOCTORMm? Spasmodic twitching of the 
          		muscles under the eye, eh, 
          		Lieutenant?SHEPMm hm.DOCTORWhat the French call a tic. T-I-C, 
          		tic. Little bothersome, isn't it?Shep puts his glasses back on.SHEPYes, sir.DOCTORI'm afraid time'll have to take care 
          		of that. Time and normal living.Shep's lips tighten skeptically.DOCTORYou two are returning to the United 
          		States, I presume?Shep glances at Cary.CARYAh, we haven't decided.DOCTORI'd take the first boat home. Well, 
          		here you go.The doctor gives Shep his release form and shakes his hand, then turns to 
          shake Cary's. Cary merely looks down darkly and raises a bandaged hand at him.DOCTOROh, I forgot your burnt hands.The doctor folds up the release and stuffs it in Cary's breast pocket.DOCTORNeither of you is fully hospitalized. 
          		I'd undertake a systematic course of 
          		finger exercises -- to, uh, stretch 
          		them and loosen them up. In time, 
          		you'll regain their full use.CARYThank you, sir.The doctor gives Cary a pat on the shoulder.DOCTORBye, Lieutenant.Cary manages a smile and salutes. Shep moves to the door, saluting the doctor.DOCTORBye, Lieutenant. Good luck.Shep opens the door and he and Cary head out. After the door closes, the 
          doctor rubs his head thoughtfully. He talks, apparently, to an offscreen aide.DOCTORWell, there they go. Out to face 
          		life. 
          			(shakes his head)
          		And their whole training was in 
          		preparation for death.He moves off as weCUT TO:EXT. HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATERShep and Cary exit the building but pause outside the doorway. They've seen 
          something coming toward them and glance at one another before clearing out of 
          its path. They watch glumly as a small group of wounded soldiers enter through 
          some metal gates, walk slowly past Shep and Cary without acknowledgment, and 
          head into the hospital.CUT TO:EXT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - PERHAPS SIMULTANEOUSThe office window opens. The doctor -- no longer in white but wearing his 
          uniform -- and his aide take a break, standing in the window frame for a 
          little fresh air. The doctor smokes a cigarette as they discuss Shep and Cary.AIDEWhy can't they go on with flying? 
          		You know, the air mails or 
          		something?DOCTORI'm afraid they're unfit for further 
          		service in that direction.The aide looks at him, quizzically.DOCTORThey fell, you know -- six thousand 
          		meters. 
          			(shakes his head, sadly)
          		Like dropping a fine Swiss watch on 
          		the pavement. Shattered both of them. 
          		Their nervous systems are deranged, 
          		disorganized, brittle.AIDESpent bullets.DOCTORSpent bullets. That's it.

          		They've described a beautiful,
          		high-arching trajectory. And now 
          		they've fallen back to earth. 
          		Spent. Cooled off. Useless.We slowly PULL BACK from the two men.AIDEOh, well, if they take care of 
          		themselves, they'll pull through

          		I hate to think what may become 
          		of them.We have pulled back far enough and now weCUT TO:EXT. HOSPITAL - NOT LONG AFTERTwo uniformed men with familiar faces -- exuberant pilot Bill and reserved 
          gunner Francis -- arrive at the bottom of the stairs in front of the hospital. 
          Bill, with his arm in a sling, and Francis, using a cane, start up the stairs 
          and wave.BILL(Texas accent)
          		Hello, Cary!FRANCISHi, Cary!At the top of the stairs, Shep and Cary wave back, pleased to see them.CARYHello, Bill! Hiya, Francis!SHEPHello, Bill! Francis!Unexpectedly, Shep and Cary hurry down the stairs past them.CARY(friendly)
          		Well, I see you got yours.BILL(pleasantly)
          		Yup. We crashed.Bill and Francis watch, surprised, as Shep and Cary hurry off.BILL(calls down, puzzled)
          		Hey! Where you going?Shep and Cary, already seated in the back of a waiting automobile, grin like 
          kids.CARYParis!BILL (o.s.)
          		Paris?!From the stairs, Francis smokes a cigarette and looks down at Shep and Cary 
          uncertainly. But Bill takes the news in stride -- he smiles and waves his hat 
          at them.BILLSee you in Paris!FRANCIS(waves his cigarette)
          		Yeah.Smiling, Shep and Cary wave back as their car drives off.DISSOLVE TO:EXT. THE EIFFEL TOWER - NIGHTA superimposed text reads:PARIS -- 1919.Traffic noise, taxi horns squeaking.DISSOLVE TO:EXT. PARIS SIDEWALK - NIGHTStrolling down the sidewalk four abreast, as if they own the town, come our 
          heroes -- Bill, Shep, Francis and Cary -- in smart hats and dinner clothes.Outwardly, they seem to have recovered from their wounds. But:Shep still wears his dark glasses and we occasionally glimpse his eye 
          twitching.Cary's bandages are gone but he has not regained full use of his hands. His 
          personality is dark and dry, more subdued than Shep's, and he comes across as 
          the most levelheaded, rational member of the group -- its unacknowledged 
          leader.Francis seems to have suffered the greatest toll psychologically. A 
          narcoleptic, strangely detached and unemotional much of the time, always on 
          the verge of dozing off, his speech slurs even when he isn't drunk.Only the athlete of the group, Bill -- a burly Texan whose full name is 
          William Talbot -- is in outstanding physical shape. But he is reckless, 
          restless, and temperamental, covering up unnamed insecurities with bravado and 
          forced exuberance.CARYHow 'bout a cocktail?SHEPNot a bad idea at that.As a group, they turn and head into a nearby building.BRIEF DISSOLVE TO:A GLOWING SIGNmade of light bulbs, outside the building. It spells out CLARIDGE'S -- a 
          popular Parisian drinking establishment for Anglo-Americans.DISSOLVE TO:INT. CLARIDGE'S - NIGHTNumerous shelves holding numerous bottles of liquor. Employees in white 
          jackets hurriedly rush in and pull down a few bottles.DISSOLVE TO:INT. CLARIDGE'S BAR - LENGTHY PANNING SHOTThe place is packed with well-dressed men and women. The bar is crowded with 
          men (and men only, for no women are allowed to sit at Claridge's bar) smoking, 
          drinking, conversing. At the end of the PAN, we discover our heroes entering, 
          greeted by an employee who takes their hats.ANOTHER VIEW - NEAR THE BARAn attractive young woman with a wide, vacant stare stands against a wall 
          opposite the bar holding a champagne glass in her hands. Her name is NIKKI and 
          she seems to be in a world all to herself.Our four handsome heroes file past her, intent on finding a table. Only Cary 
          pays any attention to Nikki. After they have all passed her, he pauses to turn 
          and stare. She's extremely nearsighted and doesn't notice him. He looks at the 
          glass in her hand, puzzled. He starts off but then pauses.After a second uncertain look, he moves off to join his friends who stand 
          together and peer around the crowded room, unable to find a place to sit. Cary 
          keeps looking at Nikki. He glances at the others and they follow his gaze:NIKKIstill wearing a blank expression, clutches the glass in two hands.THE GLASSin her hands. Between her fingers, we glimpse its contents -- a complete set 
          of men's false teeth.We PULL BACK to discover that Cary has approached her. He's standing right 
          next to her and is staring at the glass. She finally notices him.CARYI beg your pardon. But, if I'm not 
          		too inquisitive, would you mind 
          		telling me what IS that you're 
          		drinking?NIKKITeeth.CARYTeeth?After another look, Cary turns to his friends.CARYHey, it's teeth!BILL (o.s.)
          		Teeth?!Shep, Bill and Francis hurry over like children and crowd around to stare in 
          amazement at the teeth. Nikki is unimpressed by all the attention.SHEPTeeth!NIKKIThat's right.BILL(enthusiastic)
          		Yup. It's a full set -- upper and 
          		lower.CARY(to Nikki)
          		It's a nice expression.SHEPHey, how come you're with those 
          		teeth?NIKKII was just standing here. And a nice 
          		gentleman came along and begged my 
          		pardon and asked would I mind 
          		holding his teeth for a minute.CARYWell, what did he want you to hold 
          		his teeth for?NIKKISaid he wanted to biff somebody.BILL(excited)
          		Biff somebody?! Which way did he go?!NIKKIJust around to the right.BILLCome on, men! We're liable to see a 
          		fight.As quickly as they arrived, Shep, Bill and Francis depart. Cary starts after 
          them but stops to politely address Nikki who has gone back into her trance.CARYWould you like to come along?NIKKI(as if it were obvious)
          		Oh, no. I have to stay here and mind 
          		the man's teeth.They glance down at the teeth.CARYOh, of course.Cary hurries off as Nikki's empty eyes rise to the ceiling.FLASH CUT - A MAN'S FACEas it takes a combination one-two punch from a pair of fists.FLASH CUT - THE MAN'S BODYdropping unconscious to the floor.OUR FOUR HEROESenter a hallway just in time to see two Claridge's employees reach down and 
          haul away the unconscious body. Our heroes have missed the fight but Shep and 
          Bill are delighted anyway. Bill brushes his hands (one of his favorite 
          gestures) with satisfaction, as if he had thrown the punches himself:BILLWell. THAT'S all fixed.Bill straightens his bow-tie. Already the group seeks a new distraction.CARYLet's go back.They head back to the bar.THE BARNikki, no longer standing against the wall, sits on a bar stool with her back 
          to the countertop, smoking a cigarette and holding an empty champagne glass. 
          Our heroes enter and, glancing at the wall, fail to see her. After a moment of 
          searching, Cary spots her at the bar.CARYOh, there she is.All four crowd around her, pleased to be in her company.BILLWell, we missed it.NIKKIDid something happen?BILLWell, they carried a guy out.
          			(sees her empty glass)
          		Say! What's become of the teeth?NIKKIOh, the man came and got his teeth.CARYWell, what did he say?NIKKIHe said thank you for holding his 
          		teeth.CARYWhat did he look like?NIKKII think he fell in an airplane in 
          		the war -- and got his teeth knocked 
          		out.CARYWell, why do you think he was in the 
          		war?NIKKIOh, he had a kind of little striped 
          		ribbon in his buttonhole.CARYWhat makes you think he was a flyer?NIKKIHis eyes.CARYHis eyes? 
          			(dry, to the others)
          		You can tell a flyer better by his 
          		ears.The men chuckle.SHEPWell, what do you say we have a 
          		drink?BILLFine!FRANCISSure, here's some space.Seats have opened up at the bar so they grab stools next to Nikki. Shep greets 
          the bartender:SHEPHello, Jean!JEANBon soir, Monsieur Lambert.

          		Champagne cocktail pour Mademoiselle 
          		Nikki!The men are all excited to find out her name. Francis uses a pretzel as a 
          monocle to eye Nikki.FRANCISNikki?!BILLNikki?!CARYNikki?!For the first time this evening, Shep takes off his dark glasses.SHEPCan you imagine that, fellas? Her 
          		name is Nikki!CARY(considers the
          			situation)
          		Her name is Nikki. She holds men's 
          		teeth. She sits at the bar and she 
          		drinks champagne.BILL(significantly)
          		Boys, she's gonna be a lot of 
          		trouble.Drinks are served. A moment of silence as they imbibe. Nikki's hand shakes as 
          she lifts her glass, spilling some champagne. She laughs, embarrassed.NIKKIOh, my, my!Shep, who has been watching her closely, also laughs.SHEPPoor sweet! She can't even hold her 
          		glass!Nikki notices Cary unsteadily using both his hands to hold his Martini.NIKKI(casually)
          		Oh, well, HE can't either. Besides, 
          		he has to use two hands.Nikki chuckles. A dark look crosses Cary's face as he looks at her and puts 
          down his drink. Seeing this, Bill and Francis exchange worried glances. Cary 
          abruptly rises and leaves the bar. Mystified, Nikki looks quizzically at Shep 
          who is suddenly grim and annoyed.SHEPCourse he can't hold his glass. His 
          		hands are burned.NIKKIBurned?SHEPYou have no right to spill YOUR 
          		drinks. He can't help himself.NIKKIBurned? How burned?SHEPHe brought a plane down on fire.NIKKIAn airplane? In the war?Shep demonstrates with his hands as he explains:SHEPHe held the stick. But his hands 
          		began to slip. Then he held it 
          		inside his arms. He was trying to 
          		bring his rear gunner down alive.NIKKIDid he bring him down safe?SHEPWell...Shep takes a swallow of his Martini, sets down the glass.SHEPBrought him down.NIKKIOh, so that's why--?SHEPYes! That's why he can't hold a 
          		glass.NIKKIOh, I'm so ashamed.SHEPNow, Cary's had a pretty thin time. 
          		His nerves are tricky. You should 
          		never call attention to his hands.AT A TABLECary sits with a fresh drink and is trying awkwardly to pick it up when a 
          handsome but humorless American journalist -- the unspeakable FRINK -- enters 
          and greets him casually.FRINKHi, Cary.CARY(unhappily)
          		Oh, hello, Frink.Cary immediately turns his attention to a menu. Rebuffed, Frink wanders over 
          to the bar and sees the other men. He has a friendly pat on the back for 
          Francis and Bill.FRINKHello, Francis. Bill.Frink pauses to stare at Nikki's back, astonished to find a woman sitting at 
          the bar. Then he turns to Shep, amused.FRINKShep. Drunk again?SHEPSay, don't you know any OTHER 
          		opening remarks? It's about all 
          		we've heard from you for a year.FRINK(signals the bartender)
          		Hi! Jean!Frink snaps his fingers at Jean and grabs a seat next to Shep. Jean asks for 
          Frink's order in French.FRINKUn sidecar.JEANSidecar ... [?]Jean moves off. Frink regards the others.FRINKSay, why don't you fellows go home 
          		and go to work?SHEPWork? What kind of work?FRINKOh, anything useful.BILLWhat could we do? Sell washing 
          		machines? Drive a milk wagon? Mend 
          		old furniture or somethin'? Heh!FRINKGo back to flying. Fly the air 
          		mails.BILLAw, we couldn't fly a kite.FRANCISMaybe a small kite.Francis holds his fingers to indicate a very small kite. Bill chuckles.FRINKWell, there must be something you 
          		can do.SHEPWe've got to tend to our drinking. 
          		We don't get much opportunity.FRINKLots of things going on outside. 
          		Sun shining, trees growing, people 
          		walking around.BILLSay! Is that STILL going on?SHEP(laughs) 
          		Sounds pretty pre-war to me.During all this, Nikki has been in her own little world. Frink leans over and 
          whispers to Shep.FRINKHey. Don't I rate an introduction? 
          		Who's your swell friend?SHEPOh, her? Just an old hussy we found 
          		scattered around.Around her neck, on a slender chain, Nikki carries a small lorgnette. It opens 
          with a spring and has small rectangular lenses. She uses it frequently, 
          peering at unfamiliar objects in her helpless, nearsighted way. On Shep's 
          remark, she whips it out to stare at him, mildly offended. He raises his drink

          arrive. All the men, save Cary, snatch up their glasses. Bill removes the 
          toothpicked olive and swallows his Martini whole. He watches Nikki rubbing her 
          champagne's drinking straw between her hands as if she were a Boy Scout trying 
          to start a fire.BILLThen there's her drinking.NIKKIWhat's the matter with my drinking?BILLYou're a sissy drinker.NIKKIWell, maybe I can improve.Meanwhile, Cary attempts -- with some success -- to drink his Martini with one

          		to Jane. And that's how it all began.An odd CHIMING sound distracts them. They look off to see:FRANCISthe narcoleptic, arms folded, asleep in his chair. He awakes with a frown, 
          pulls a pocket watch from inside his jacket, opens it, and looks at it. The

          Bill hangs on and tries to calm the horse. Cary tries to pull Bill away as 
          Frink, Francis and the driver gather around. Bill is more interested in

          crowded tables. A handsome male dancer, in tuxedo and top hat, whirls 
          exuberantly around the floor, surrounded by beautiful chorus girls.Somewhere above all this, Nikki, lit by spotlight flashes, sits on the edge of 
          a ringside balcony observing the show with eager interest through her 
          lorgnette.The show continues: after a few twirls, the dancer links arms with the girls
