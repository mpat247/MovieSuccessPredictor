FADE IN:1   EXT:   MIDTOWN MANHATTAN STREETS - DAYBehind the opening credits, we watch a montage of RUPERT
    PUPKIN making his daily rounds as a messenger delivering
    manila envelopes and packages to various New York offices,
    always courteous and polite in his demeanor, PUPKIN is an
    attractive-looking young man just past thirty and dressed
    in a stylish blue suit, broad tie and wide-collared shirt.
    His shoes are neatly polished, his hair carefully groomed.
    As the montage continues, we see that he has finished his
    deliveries and is walking rapidly towards his destination.
    It turns out to be a television theater north of Times
    Square whose marquee announces THE JERRY LANGFORD SHOW.
    It is dusk and the show is about to break. There is a
    very small crowd already positioned at the stage door --
    a few young girls, a few curious passers-by who have
    stopped to see who will emerge. Three professional
    autograph hunters are clustered together:

    MAE, a lady in her sixties, wears a red velvet dress, a
    lace hat and much too much rouge.

    SIDNEY is in his mid-twenties, tall, badly-complexioned,
    slicked hair but otherwise neatly dressed. He carries
    a brown lunch bag.

    CELESTE is an enormously fat woman in her mid-thirties.
    She wears a large cape to conceal her obesity.

    A middle-aged MAN, dressed in a corduroy suit,    emerges
    from the backstage door which is guarded by a    large,
    white-haired POLICEMAN. The non-professionals     in the
    crowd just peer at the MAN but MAE immediately    steps in
    front of him with her autograph book raised.MAE(to the MAN)
           Are you somebody?MANNo, honey, I'm just a working stiff.

    The MAN keep walking and MAE returns to her cohorts
    just as PUPKIN arrives.MAEHi, Rupert.CELESTE(coolly)
           Hello, Rupert.SIDNEYWho did you get?PUPKIN(distractedly)
     Nobody.

PUPKIN carefully places himself near the door, a step or
two away from the other professionals.MAE(to SIDNEY)
     I got Mr. Raf Vallone outside 21.CELESTE(to SIDNEY about PUPKIN)
     He'd never tell you anyway, Sidney.MAEThen I got him again at the
     Pierre at four o'clock.SIDNEYBe a dear, Mae. I don't happen
     to have Mr. Vallone.MAEYou know what I want for him.SIDNEYBut I have only six Barbra's left.
     You know how difficult she is to
     work with.MAEI don't have her even once.CELESTE(to MAE)
     Maybe Rupert would help you.

PUPKIN shoots a hostile glance back at CELESTE.SIDNEYWould you do that, Rupert? You don't
     feel about Barbra the way I do.MAEI'll give you Mr. Burt Reynolds too.CELESTE(needling RUPERT)
     Look, Sidney, Rupert doesn't do
     that sort of thing.SIDNEYHow about it, Rupert?   I'll give
     you whoever you want.

SIDNEY starts pulling little white cards out of his paper
bag and reading them off.SIDNEYRodney    Dangerfield ... Richard
     Harris    ... Liza Minelli ... and
     she's    not so easy to work with
     either    ... Louise Lasser!CELESTEYou're wasting your time.

PUPKIN has been trying to remain apart from the other
three. Finally he turns to SIDNEY.PUPKINLook, Sidney. I'm just not
     interested. This isn't my
     whole life, you know.CELESTEWhat's that supposed to mean --
     that it'smywhole life, or
     Sidney's or Mae's?MAEItisso my whole life.CELESTEShut up, Mae. What about your
     mother? Isn't she part of
     your life?MAEIt's her whole life too.

The show breaks. The doors swing open and people pour out.
The crowd around the backstage door swells.POLICEMAN(to the crowd)
     If you want Jerry's autograph, give
     me your piece of paper and I'll
     send it backstage.

A number of people in the crowd hand in pieces of paper.
PUPKIN is standing next to a young couple, about college
age. The YOUNG GIRL has just sent in her paper.PUPKIN(to the GIRL)
     What are you going to do with
     Jerry's autograph?YOUNG GIRLI don't know. Maybe I'll sell it.BOYFRIENDI'll tell you what she's going to
     do with it. She's going to pinit on her bulletin board and
     have an orgasm.

The YOUNG GIRL laughs unself-consciously.CUT TO:LANGFORD's limousine waits directly in front of the stage
door. MAE has engaged the CHAUFFEUR who stands at the
door of the car in conversation.CHAUFFEUR(wearily)
     No, Mae.MAEI don't mean now.CHAUFFEURNo, Mae.MAEI'll get right out.

The CHAUFFEUR, smiling, shakes his head.CUT TO:A plain-looking GIRL in a black raincoat and black, floppy
hat stands on the street side of the limousine,
carefully watching MAE and the CHAUFFEUR talk.CUT TO:MAEBut I've never been in one.

We hear a cry as a celebrity emerges from the backstage
door. MAE turns and goes back towards the door.CUT TO:The POLICEMAN is handing out the autographs. Suddenly
LANGFORD emerges, flanked by three PAGES, husky young men
in their early twenties dressed in theater uniforms.
There is screaming and some yelling of LANGFORD's name.
LANGFORD pays no attention. Smiling nervously, he makes
his way towards the limousine. The CHAUFFEUR stands at
the rear of the car, holding the door. LANGFORD enters
the car and then suddenly springs back. The GIRL in the
black raincoat and black hat has hidden herself in the
back seat of the limousine. The three PAGES, who have
already turned and headed back toward the theater, hear
the commotion and swing around. The GIRL, who we shall
come to know as MARSHA, hides herself in the far end of
the limo, so two of the PAGES go around to the far side
of the car and start pulling her out while the third PAGE
moves into the limo from the street side. She fightslike a wildcat, but the PAGES slowly    manage to drag her
out. During the struggle, LANGFORD     stands amid the crowd,
a bit shaken. PUPKIN stands next to     him, staring at him.
When finally catches LANGFORD's eye,    PUPKIN smiles
pleasantly.PUPKIN(to LANGFORD who
           barely listens)
     How the hell did that girl get in
     there? Jesus, they certainly
     don't give you very good protection,
     do they?

LANGFORD says nothing, glancing nervously at PUPKIN.PUPKINLook at you here. Who the hell
     is watching you? Any one of
     these freaks could just walk
     right up to you and do whatever
     he wants.

A couple YOUNG GIRLS are pressing against LANGFORD.FIRST GIRLOh, Jerry. How can we get to
     talk to you?PUPKINJust a minute. This is crazy.

PUPKIN straightens up for action.PUPKIN(yelling at the crowd)
     Okay! Stand back!

PUPKIN wades through the crowd towards the limousine,
pushing SIDNEY and MAE among others out of the way.
LANGFORD follows in the path PUPKIN is clearing.PUPKINDidn't you hear me?!?    Come on,
     people, have a heart.

The PAGES have succeeded in pulling the GIRL out of the
far door of the limo just as PUPKIN and LANGFORD arrive
at the near door. The CHAUFFEUR has been blocked by the
crowd from opening the door so PUPKIN opens it.PUPKINStand back!    (To LANGFORD)   Go ahead,
     Jerry.

LANGFORD slips in quickly. He looks up at PUPKIN who is
holding the door, smiling pleasantly.LANGFORDThanks.   Thanks very much.

    PUPKIN stares at LANGFORD for a moment and then slides
    into the limo next to him, closing the door behind him.2   INT:   LIMO - NIGHTPUPKINI hate to bother you like this, Jerry,
           but could I speak to you for a minute.LANGFORDI'd like to but ...PUPKINI know you're a busy man. I promise not
           to take very long, really. But I need
           your advice.

    PUPKIN looks down at his hand which has been badly
    scratched.PUPKINYou don't have a handkerchief, do you?
           Jesus, these people will kill you for a
           cufflink.

    LANGFORD hands him a monogrammed handkerchief, then checks
    his watch.PUPKINThanks. If you have to be somewhere, I
           don't mind talking as we drive. You can
           drop me off anywhere.LANGFORDSorry, but I've got a strict rule never to ...PUPKINI put myself on the line for you, Jerry.

    Reluctantly, LANGFORD signals with his head to his
    CHAUFFEUR to start moving. As the car moves through New
    York traffic, PUPKIN and LANGFORD talk.PUPKINThanks, Jerry. I'm grateful for this chance
           to talk to you ... I hope I'm not boring you.LANGFORDI'll let you know.PUPKINReally? Fine. I'm      Rupert Pupkin, Jerry.
           I know that the name    itself doesn't mean
           very much to you but    it means an awful lot
           to me, believe me.     Maybe you've seen meoutside your show and wondered who I am.
     Well, right now, I'm in communications but,
     by nature, I'm a stand-up comedian. I know
     what you're thinking -- 'oh no. Not another
     one.' And I wouldn't take up even one minute
     of your time if I wasn't absolutely convinced
     of my talent. I'm really good, Jerry,
     believe me, I'm dynamite. Now you're probably
     wondering if I'm so good why haven't you
     caught my act somewhere, right?LANGFORDWell ...PUPKINWell, up to now, I've been biding my time,
     developing my act slowly and carefully so
     that when my big break finally comes, I'm
     ready -- like you were that night Paar got
     sick and you sat in for him. I was there
     that night, in the theater. That was the
     most important night of my life, until
     tonight, of course.

PUPKIN fishes a cigarette case out of his jacket pocket,
flips it open and offers one to LANGFORD.LANGFORDNo thanks.   I don't smoke.

PUPKIN returns the pack to his pocket.PUPKINMe neither. I just carry them as a
     courtesy. How about a cough drop?LANGFORD(smiling indulgently)
     No thanks. I don't cough.PUPKINI try not to but sometimes, you know
     ... Am I making any sense?LANGFORD(smiling)
     Go on.PUPKINWell, that night you did Paar, I walked
     out of the theater like I was in a dream.
     All of a sudden, I knew what I wanted.
     I started catching your guest appearances
     on Sullivan and taping them and, when you
     got your own show, it got to be a kind of
     regular thing. I studied how you built
     to your one-liners, nice and relaxed like
     you were chatting, and how you deliveredthe jokes without leaning too much on
     them, without saying "here's the punchline,
     folks." And I watched the way you played
     off dead audiences, how you let those long
     silences build until people couldn't
     stand it and then the way you got them
     off the hook with that slow smile. You
     were my college of comedy, Jerry, like
     a kind of teacher, a friend. I know it
     sounds crazy, but when you watch someone
     every night ... But that's all in the
     past. What I'm trying to say is this.
     I'm ready now. I've finished the course.
     And I'm thinking as we sit here talking
     "Is this it? Is this that one big break?"
     Is it, Jerry?

There is a long pause.PUPKINJerry?LANGFORDLook ... er ... what was the name?PUPKINI'm Rupert, Jerry.LANGFORDLook, Rupert. I know what you're saying.
     But things don't work that way. You can't
     just walk onto a network show without any
     experience. You've got to start at the
     bottom ...PUPKINBut that's where I am!LANGFORDYou've got to work your way up, learn your
     trade in front of live audiences, start
     playing the little clubs.PUPKINBut that can take years, Jerry! Look at
     me. I'm already 31 years old! People my
     age are way ahead of me. I've got some
     catching up to do and I need your help.
     What do you say, Jerry? All I'm asking
     you to do is listen to my act. That's all.
     Is that asking too much?LANGFORDI get calls from agents every day.
     All they want ...PUPKINI tried getting an agent.   I did, Jerry.But you know how it is. You can't get an
           agent unless you're working and you can't
           get work unless you've got an agent ...
           or unless you know somebody. And the
           only person I know is you, Jerry.

    There is a long pause.LANGFORDLook, why don't you call my office.PUPKINCould I?!? Oh, I knew you'd say that,
           Jerry. You don't know how many times I've
           had this conversation in my head. And this
           is the way it always turns out. That's why
           I had to sort of invite myself into the car
           tonight. I know it's kind of presumptuous
           and I really appreciate the time you've
           given me. But breaks like this don't just
           happen. You have to make your own breaks.

    The limousine starts slowing down as it pulls up before
    U.N. Plaza. It stops. LANGFORD gets out. PUPKIN follows.3   EXT:   U.N. PLAZA APARTMENTS - NIGHTLANGFORD turn to PUPKIN,    looking to get rid of him as
    cleanly and gracefully as    possible. LANGFORD extends
    his hand. PUPKIN goes to     shake it but his hand is wrapped
    in the handkerchief. He     extends his left hand. LANGFORD
    shakes it awkwardly.LANGFORDNice meeting you, Rupert.   I hope it all
           works out for you.PUPKINThanks, Jerry. I don't know how to repay
           you. I'm a little short on cash this
           evening, but, if you don't mind some good,
           hearty food, I'd be honored to take you
           to dinner.LANGFORDThanks, but some people are waiting for me.PUPKINOh, I understand. Well, then, maybe I could
           repay you with a joke.

    LANGFORD is starting to walk into the building.PUPKINWait a minute. How's this? The      first night
           you do your show from the coast,    you open
           this way. "Good evening, ladies    and
           gentlemen, it's great to be back    here inSouthern California where you can wake up
           in the morning and listen to the birds
           coughing ... "LANGFORD(nodding but unsmiling)
           Not bad. Maybe.

    PUPKIN calls after LANGFORD who heads for the entrance
    to his building.PUPKINConsider it a gift. Hey, Jerry!
           How about lunch? My treat!LANGFORD(turning back before
                 he enters the building)
           Call my office.

    PUPKIN waves with his bandaged hand, notices LANGFORD's
    handkerchief and unwraps it.PUPKIN(to the handkerchief)
           Thanks, Jerry.

    The CAMERA MOVES IN for a CLOSE-UP of PUPKIN in a kind of daze.FADE TO:4   INT:   SARDI'S RESTAURANT - DAYPUPKIN and LANGFORD stand at the edge of the foyer, waiting
    for the Maitre d' to seat them. VINCENT, the owner, spots
    them and hurries over.VINCENTI'm sorry, Mr. Langford. (To PUPKIN,
           angrily) How did you get in?LANGFORDThat's alright, Vincent.   Mr. Pupkin's a
           friend of mine.VINCENT(puzzled)
           Oh, I see.PUPKINThat's alright. Now if you'd be good enough
           to find us a nice table.

    PUPKIN pushes a five dollar bill into VINCENT's hand.VINCENTCertainly.   This way, please.VINCENT leads PUPKIN and LANGFORD to the "bullpen," a
select spot in a corner of the restaurant.VINCENTHere you are. Enjoy your lunch, gentlemen.LANGFORDIs Eddie here today, Vincent?VINCENTI'll send him over.

A WAITER arrives and hands them the menu.WAITEROur specialty today is Rizzofino Dolce Acqua
     a la Marinara con Spezi. Very good.PUPKINSounds like a new opera.LANGFORDFine.   What comes with it?WAITERMe.

The three laugh.PUPKINFine.   For two.WAITERVery good.

The WAITER leaves.PUPKINYou look tired, Jerry.LANGFORDIt shows, does it? It's all these problems
     with the show. That and the custody suit.PUPKINI was sorry to read about that, Jerry.
     Charlene never should have gotten the
     kids. If there's anything I can do.LANGFORDI appreciate it, Rube. Just talking about
     it a little with you helps.

Eddie arrives. He     is a small, slightly-bald man with
greying hair and a    goatee. He wears a foulard under an
open-necked shirt.     He carries a long sketch pad. He
immediately sets up    a small easel and starts sketching.PUPKINHasn't Eddie already done you?LANGFORDNever mind. You were saying ...PUPKINWell, I've been giving a lot of thought
     to your situation, Jerry, ever since I
     saw you starting to lose ground in the
     ratings. And I think I know what the
     problem is. Too many of the same faces.LANGFORDYeah?PUPKINSure, people are getting tired of these
     people who live off game shows and talk
     shows and can't reallydoanything. They've
     seen 'em and heard 'em till they can't
     stand it anymore.LANGFORDYou know, maybe you're right, Rube.PUPKINI'm sure I am. When a show runs out of
     surprises, it loses its audience.

A YOUNG GIRL stands before PUPKIN and LANGFORD.   She hands
PUPKIN her autograph book.PUPKINWhat's your name, dear?GIRLDolores.PUPKIN(writing)
     To Dolores, who sensed greatness.
     Rupert Pupkin.GIRL(reading it)
     Thanks, Mr. Pupkin.

The GIRL leaves.PUPKINYou see what I mean? What you need on the
     show is some unknown quantity, some brilliant
     talent making his television debut. Imagine
     the suspense. Who is this young guy? How
     will he do with the eyes of all America on
     him? Something like that has got to help.LANGFORDAnd that's where you come in.PUPKINWhy not? Believe me,     Jerry, I'd give you
           the credit you deserve    and I'll stick with
           you. Anytime you need     me, I'll be there,
           doing a few minutes at    Guild scale.LANGFORDI'd be grateful, Rube.     I really would.EDDIEAll finished, Mr. Langford.

    EDDIE turns the caricature so PUPKIN and LANGFORD can see
    it. It's a picture of the two of them, facing each other
    and smiling.PUPKINOh, Jerry, you sneaky ...LANGFORDLooks good, Eddie.

    The WAITER arrives with a bottle of champagne.PUPKINWhat's this?WAITERCompliments of Mr. Sardi.

    EDDIE hangs the picture of LANGFORD and PUPKIN on the wall
    behind them among the hundreds of other caricatures --
    from Bankhead to Sid Caesar to Bette Davis. The CAMERA
    PANS over these. We hear the champagne pop.PUPKIN'S VOICEHow does your afternoon look?LANGFORD'S VOICEWhat have you got in mind?PUPKIN'S VOICEWell, we've still got time to catch
           the Cubs and the Mets out at Shea.LANGFORD'S VOICEWhy not? But first, a toast. To you,
           Rube and your success.PUPKIN'S VOICEThanks, Jerry.FADE TO:5   EXT:   U.N. PLAZA - NIGHTPUPKINThanks, Jerry.

    PUPKIN takes LANGFORD's handkerchief and folds it
    reverentially, tucking it carefully into his breast pocket.
    He claps his hands together a few times for joy and
    dashes into the street to hail a cab.CUT TO:6   INT:   LANGFORD'S APARTMENTLANGFORD enters his apartment. It is tasteful, modern,
    spacious and empty. A floodlight shines on a single
    setting at the end of a long dinner table. He walks over
    to a large aquarium and sprinkles some food for the fish.LANGFORD(to the fish)
           Say hello to Jerry.

    On a shelf above the aquarium stand three pictures, one of
    two boys, roughly eight and eleven, flanked by a shot of
    each boy alone. LANGFORD walks to the end of the table
    where a covered dish and a New York Post await him. He
    lifts the covered dish which reveals a large, cold salmon.LANGFORD(to the fish)
           Say hello to Jerry.

    LANGFORD begins poking at the fish with his fork.    The
    phone rings. He answers it.LANGFORDYeah.GIRL'S VOICEIt's Marsha, Jerry. Did you get my note?
           I left it on the back seat. Did you get it?
           I dropped it there before they pulled me
           out. Those guys hurt me, Jerry. (pause)
           Jerry?LANGFORD(icily)
           Who gave you this number?MARSHA'S VOICEDon't be    angry with me, Jerry. I didn't
           know what    else to do; I've been trying
           you every    five minutes, I miss you,
           baby ...    Jerry?

    LANGFORD hangs up the phone and then takes it off the receiver.LANGFORDSay goodbye to Jerry.

     He shakes his head wearily, returns to his dinner and turns
     to the inside pages of the New York Post.CUT TO:7    EXT:   LEXINGTON AVENUE IN THE SIXTIES - NIGHTA cab pulls up in front of an all-night florist shop.
     PUPKIN dashes out of the cab and into the florist's.
     The cab waits.CUT TO:8    EXT:   LEXINGTON AVENUE IN THE SIXTIES - NIGHTPUPKIN dashes out of the florist's clutching a single red
     rose. He hops back into the cab which starts moving.CUT TO:9    EXT:   A STREET OFF BROADWAY - NIGHTThe cab pulls up in front of Gil's Steaks and Chops, a
     restaurant of little distinction that has a few checkered
     tableclothed tables in the rear and a long bar at the
     front. PUPKIN stares through the window of the bar at
     RITA, the bargirl, an attractive, somewhat shopworn blonde
     in her late twenties. PUPKIN enters.CUT TO:10   INT:   BAR-RESTAURANTPUPKIN goes to the near end of the sparsely-populated bar.PUPKINMiss!

     RITA comes over.    PUPKIN smiles knowingly.PUPKINA beer please, Miss.    Something imported.RITAHeineken's alright?PUPKINFine.

     RITA serves him a Heineken's.     She stares at him, searching
     his face.PUPKINHow have you been, Rita?

     She stares again.RITAYou're not Rupert Pupkin!

PUPKIN smiles broadly.RITAHow the hell did you find me?PUPKINSally Gardner, I met her after a matinee.
     Aren't you glad to see me?RITASure, sure.    How is old Sally?PUPKINThe same, I guess. You know, two kids,
     a nice husband, living in Clifton.RITAIt figures.PUPKINA lot of the kids in our class have
     moved back.RITAWhat are you doing here?PUPKINI just thought I'd say hello. Here,
     I brought you a little something.RITA(recognizing his style)
     Oh, yeah, Mr. Romance.PUPKINDon't forget to put in an aspirin.
     It lasts longer.

RITA fills a glass of water and puts in the rose.RITANothing's gonna keep it alive in this place.PUPKINHow have you been, dear, sweet Rita?RITAI don't have an aspirin.PUPKINMaybe a Rolaids would work.

PUPKIN pulls out a pack of Rolaids and hands one to RITA
who smiles vaguely and drops it into the glass.RITAWell, what are you up to these days,
     Rupert?PUPKINDidn't you know you'd see me again?RITAYou still going to the movies?PUPKINYou're looking as beautiful as ever.RITAOh, yeah.   I was a real knockout.PUPKINI thought so.RITAWell, here I am.     Local cheerleader
     makes good.PUPKINI voted for you for Most Beautiful.RITAYeah?PUPKINI didn't have the nerve to tell you then,
     but I guess it's alright now.RITAWell, nothing terrible's gonna happen,
     if that's what you mean.

There is an awkward pause.    PUPKIN stares admiringly atRITA.RITAWell, how are things with you, Rupert?PUPKINGreat!   Everything's starting to break.RITAIs that right?PUPKINYeah. As a matter of fact, that's why
     I'm here. I've known about this place
     for a long time. I just didn't want
     to make my move until I had something
     to offer you. Everything's a question
     of timing.RITA stares at PUPKIN as he rattles on.PUPKINWhat's the matter?

RITA shakes her head in disbelief and chuckles.RITAJesus Christ, Rupert Pupkin!PUPKIN(smiling)
     The two of usareoften confused.     He's
     the one with the famous father.

PUPKIN waits for a laugh. RITA just keeps shaking her
head. PUPKIN looks around.PUPKIN(critically)
     You like this place?

RITA shrugs.RITAWhy, you got something better?PUPKINMaybe.RITAWhat?PUPKINWhat are you doing tonight?RITATonight?

RITA starts laughing.PUPKIN(smiling reluctantly)
     What's so funny?RITA(still laughing)
     You call me up all junior and    senior year.
     Night after night after night,    right? And
     every time I'm wondering 'when    is this guy
     going to stop talking and ask    me out?'
     Well, now I know the answer.     August
     twelfth, nineteen seventy-six.     It only
     took you ten, eleven years to    work up to it.PUPKINIf I had asked you out?   Would you
     have gone?RITAOh, no.PUPKINWhy not?

RITA starts laughing again.RITABecause I thought you were a jerk!PUPKINYou see! I was right! But that guy isn't
     me anymore. I look at my picture in the
     yearbook and I don't even recognize myself.
     I'm not the same guy, Rita.

A bull-necked MAN in his early forties enters. He waves
a brief hello to RITA as he walks by. RITA smiles and
the MAN takes a seat at the far end of the bar.MANRita!RITA(to PUPKIN)
     Excuse me a minute, honey.PUPKINI'm not honey! I'm Rupert.

RITA goes to the far end of the bar and serves the MAN a
beer. They chat briefly as PUPKIN watches uneasily.
Finally PUPKIN downs his beer and raises his glass.PUPKINMiss!     Miss!

The MAN gets RITA's attention for PUPKIN.   RITA returns
to PUPKIN and serves him another beer.PUPKINI'm in the mood to celebrate tonight.
     Why don't we go to this nice restaurant
     I know, talk over and times, get to
     know each other all over again.RITAAnd then?PUPKINWell, tomorrow night I thought we'd
     go out again, talk some more, get to
     know each other even better.RITAHow much?PUPKINHow much what?RITAHow much do we have to get to know
     each other?PUPKINI don't understand.RITA(emphatically)
     How much do we have to get to know each
     other before we start talking about
     that job?PUPKINI'm not talking about any job.RITAThen what's this big offer you were
     talking about?PUPKINYou'll see.    Right now I'm asking you
     for a date.    How about it?RITAI'm sorry, Rupert.     But I'm busy.PUPKINBusy?RITAYeah.   Busy.PUPKINBut this is the biggest night of my life.RITAI've already got a date.

The MAN at the end of the bar raises his glass.MANRita!

RITA goes to the far end of the bar. She pours him another
beer and settles against the bar, resuming her chat with
him. PUPKIN looks for a moment and downs his beer. He
raises his glass.PUPKINMiss!   Miss!

RITA returns to him.PUPKINIs that your date?RITANone of your business.PUPKINWhat do you want to go out withhimfor?RITAHe's a good friend of mine.PUPKINTellhimyou're busy.RITAWhat's so important about tonight?PUPKINEverything!    You don't understand.RITANo. I don't. It's been really nice
            seeing you, Rupert. Thanks for dropping
            in. But I've got some work to do.

     RITA leaves PUPKIN and returns to the far end of the bar
     where she once again resumes talking with the MAN. PUPKIN
     sits for a moment, gets up slowly and heads for the john.11   INT:   THE JOHN - NIGHTHe enters the john and goes to the farthest of the three
     urinals. A moment later, the MAN enters. He goes to the
     nearest of the three urinals. The two men stare at the
     wall before them but the obvious tension between them
     renders them both incapable of relieving themselves.
     PUPKIN glances over at the MAN's face, then immediately
     turns back to the wall as the MAN turns to look at him.
     The MAN glances quickly at PUPKIN and then returns to
     staring at the wall. PUPKIN sneaks a furtive glance at
     the MAN's penis. The MAN sneaks a furtive glance at
     PUPKIN's penis.CUT TO:12   INT:   THE BAR - NIGHTPUPKIN emerges from the john, followed a moment later by
     the MAN. They resume their seats at each end of the bar.
     A third MAN has come in and is seated midway between PUPKIN
     and the MAN.PUPKINMiss!

     RITA walks over reluctantly.PUPKINListen to me for a second.RITAI have work to do, Rupert.PUPKINJust listen. I'm at the start     of
     something really big. I don't     want
     to talk about it here but it's    going
     to happen soon and it's going    to be
     great -- for both of us.RITANo kidding?PUPKINSo see that guy some other night.MANRita!

RITA turns to go.PUPKINBut I haven't finished!

RITA returns to the MAN and pours him another beer. PUPKIN
sits for a few moments, then downs his beer quickly. Again,
he raises his glass.PUPKINMiss!   Miss!

The MAN leans over the bar and tells RITA something. She
opens a bottle of beer and hands it to the MAN who slides
it down the bar towards PUPKIN. As the beer reaches the
middle of the bar, the THIRD MAN seated midway between
PUPKIN and the MAN raises his beer glass to take a sip just
as the sliding beer bottle passes under his hand. The
bottle stops right in front of PUPKIN who takes it and
slides it back with equal force. At this moment, the THIRD
MAN in the middle has finished his sip and has just placed
the THIRD MAN's glass on the counter. The beer bottle
collides with the THIRD MAN's glass, creating a mess. RITA
glares at PUPKIN as does the THIRD MAN. PUPKIN shrugs an
apology and RITA cleans up the mess.RITA(to the THIRD MAN)
     I'll get you another one.

As RITA cleans up the mess and pours a fresh beer, the MAN
walks down the bar towards PUPKIN. He leans over him and
puts a supposedly friendly paw on his shoulder. PUPKIN
glances distastefully at the MAN's hand on him.MAN(to PUPKIN)
     Look,    friend. I'm trying to have a
     nice    civilized conversation with the
     young    lady. Be a good little lad,
     huh,    and give us a break.

PUPKIN looks up at the MAN who pats him on the back in a
gesture of fraudulent friendship and menace. PUPKIN burps.
With an effort, the MAN controls his temper and returns to
his seat at the end of the bar. PUPKIN instantly raises
his glass.PUPKINMiss!     Miss!

The MAN advances towards PUPKIN with another bottle of
beer. PUPKIN watches passively as the MAN pours half the
bottle into PUPKIN's breast pocket and slams the half-empty
bottle on the counter. The MAN walks down to the end of
the counter where a smiling RITA is waiting.

PUPKIN again gulps his beer down. RITA and the MAN stare
at PUPKIN expecting him to raise his glass and call for
another beer. PUPKIN just sits there. After a few
moments, RITA and the MAN resume their conversation, but
they keep glancing over at PUPKIN, expecting him to
interrupt them with a call for beer at any moment. PUPKIN
continues to sit there. Just as RITA and the MAN have
settled back into their conversation, PUPKIN falls like a
stone from the barstool onto the floor. He lies
motionless. RITA and the MAN look at PUPKIN for a moment
while the handful of other patrons glance at him and return
to their drinks. RITA leaves the bar and goes to the rear
of the restaurant, disappearing into the kitchen. As she
does, the MAN walks over to where PUPKIN is lying inert
and prods him cruelly with his foot.MANC'mon, schmuck, wake up so I can
     kick your ass outta here.

The MAN turns to the kitchen to see if RITA is returning.
As he does, PUPKIN carefully opens one eye, grabs a free
chair from a nearby cocktail table, rises and bangs the MAN
smartly over the head. The MAN falls, out cold. PUPKIN
straightens up quickly as the other patrons look on with
interest. PUPKIN brushes off his suit, which is blue, just
like the MAN's, and stands above the MAN just as the MAN
stood above him, his back to kitchen. RITA emerges from
the kitchen with the owner, MR. NICHOLS and a large blackCOOK.RITA(to NICHOLS)
     He was making trouble one minute
     and the next he was on the floor.

RITA automatically reaches out as she talks for what shethinks is the MAN's arm. Instead, PUPKIN turns around
     smiling, leaving her too startled to speak. NICHOLS and
     the COOK lift the MAN to his feet.COOKOkay, buddy, here we go.

     NICHOLS and the COOK lead the MAN, who is still groggy, out
     of the bar as RITA continues to stare at PUPKIN with a
     mixture of curiosity and amusement.RITAOkay, Tarzan. Where do we eat tonight?CUT TO:13   INT:   CHINESE RESTAURANT ON UPPER WEST SIDE - NIGHTWe are in the kitchen watching two dishes being chopped,
     shredded and boiled in deep fat. The activity is frantic.
     WE FOLLOW the two dishes as a WAITER carries them from the
     kitchen to a booth where PUPKIN and RITA are talking. It
     is a painfully plain restaurant, shaped in a rectangle,
     with booths lining either side and a row of little tables
     in between. At the back is the kitchen and two phone
     booths, facing each other. An old Chinese WOMAN mans the
     cash register by the door. The WAITER sets the dishes down
     before RITA and PUPKIN and clears an enormous plate of
     spare rib bones from RITA's place. RITA hands the WAITER
     her empty cocktail glass. RITA and PUPKIN are facing one
     another.RITAAnother one, Chan.PUPKIN(to WAITER)
            Chopsticks, please.

     The WAITER nods and leaves.RITASo all this time you've been thinking
            about me, huh?PUPKINThat's right, Rita.RITAWhat kinds of things were you thinking?

     PUPKIN drops his eyes shyly.      RITA starts laughing.RITAOh, ho! Those kinds of things!    Shame
            on you, Rupert.PUPKINRita, I assure you there was ...RITARupert Pupkin is an unclean person!PUPKINCome on, Rita. People will hear.RITA(in a whisper)
     Rupert Pupkin is an unclean person. Oh,
     come on, Rupert. Relax. Have a little fun.

WAITER arrives with RITA's drink and chopsticks and a beer
for PUPKIN.PUPKINThis is a very important evening to me,
     Rita.RITADid you know your nose wiggled when
     you talked?PUPKINIt does?RITAYeah. Just the tip. Like a rabbit.
     (pause) Hey, are we gonna eat or
     what? I'm starving.

PUPKIN serves RITA.RITAIt always looks like they put worms
     in this stuff.PUPKINJust taste.

RITA tastes.RITAWell, I guess it won't kill me.PUPKINThis is supposed to be the finest
     Cantonese cuisine in the city.RITAYeah? Then what happened to the
     tablecloths?

PUPKIN drops his eyes.RITAOh, don't worry about it.   This isfine. (She takes a long drink) I'm
     having a good time. So you've been
     devoted to me, huh?PUPKINI used to see you at the Garden
     every year.RITAOh, the Follies. That was the right
     name for 'em. How did you know which
     one was me? We all looked like chickens.
     What I mean is, we all looked like thesamechicken. I thought it was gonna be
     Rita Keane in the Ice Follies and I
     wind up looking like Henny Penny.

RITA chuckles to herself.PUPKINYou just didn't get the breaks.RITABreaks, bullshit! My parents didn't
     have the money for the right coach.
     But what difference does it make?

She starts laughing to herself.RITAI remember once we were down in
     Atlanta and the ice machine broke
     down. We did three hours of slush.
     Everyone was falling on their faces
     and hopping up with their arms open
     for a bow like the whole thing was
     planned. And the people ate it up.PUPKINI liked the show.RITAYeah? The Follies? You really must
     have been carrying the torch. What
     did you think when I got married?
     You knew I got married?PUPKINI knew it wouldn't last.RITAYou think I should have married you,
     instead, huh?PUPKINPeterDrysdale!     Really, Rita!RITAIf he'd only been hit by a train.
     He was worth a helluva lot more dead
     than alive, I can tell you that.

RITA raises her glass to the WAITER who is standing nearby,
talking with another WAITER. As she does, a nice-looking
young MAN sitting in the middle aisle raises his glass of
beer to her and drinks it, as a kind of toast. RITA
smiles briefly and her eyes return to PUPKIN. The YOUNG
MAN is seated behind PUPKIN, facing RITA. The WAITER comes
over and collects the glass. Throughout the rest of the
scene, a subtle flirtation continues between RITA and theYOUNG MAN.PUPKINAre you seeing anyone?

RITA starts for a moment, thinking PUPKIN has caught her
looking at the YOUNG MAN.RITAWhat do you mean?PUPKINI want to know about the competition,
     that's all.RITAWell, tomorrow night, I've got a date
     with Joe Namath -- you know Joe. And
     Thursday --- let's see --PUPKINI'm serious, Rita.RITA(imitating him)
     I'm serious, Rita. (In her own voice)
     Sure I see people. I'm not a nun, Rupert.
     I see a lot of people.PUPKINAnyone special?RITA(chuckling)
     You mean am I "going steady"?   Rupert,
     I'm thirty-one years old!PUPKINWhat about that guy tonight?RITAHim?PUPKINWhy him?RITAWhat am I supposed to do, huh? Sit
     home watching TV? He's just some guy.
     He's got his own aluminum siding
     business. He comes into the city
     sometimes, that's all.PUPKINYou don't go out with him for his
     money?!?RITAOh, horrors! Look, Rupert, what do
     you think they pay me in that dump?
     Ninety-five bucks. And you don't get
     the world's greatest tippers in there
     either.Somebodyhas to take care of
     me.PUPKINThat's what I want to talk to you
     about, Rita.

The WAITER arrives with RITA's drink.PUPKINWho's your favorite movie star?RITAYou are, Rupert.     Especially your nose.PUPKINJust tell me.RITAIs this some kind of game? Are you
     going to tell me something about my
     character?PUPKINYou'll see.    Give me his name.RITAI can't think of anybody.PUPKINYou've got to have one, Rita. Everybody
     does.RITAOkay. Okay. Let's see.       (pause)
     Marilyn Monroe.

PUPKIN slowly pulls out a leather-bound book from his
inside jacket pocket.RITAOh, Rupert!    Are we going to exchangephone numbers!?

PUPKIN expertly flips to a middle page in the book and,
keeping the book open, his finger pointing under a name,
he turns the book to RITA.RITAThat's her name.PUPKINHer name! She signed this herself,
     especially for me.

RITA starts flipping through the book, curious about the
other names. She isn't paying any attention to what PUPKIN
is saying.PUPKINShe wasn't a great actress but she had
     a real gift for comedy. She died
     tragically, you know, alone, like so
     many of the world's most beautiful
     women. I'm going to see that doesn't
     happen to you, Rita.RITAWho's this one?

PUPKIN checks the book.PUPKINBurt Reynolds.RITAOh yeah, the guy with no clothes.
     Who's this?PUPKINMel Brooks.RITAAnd this?PUPKINCarol Burnett.RITANo kidding.    How about this?PUPKINGlenda Jackson.RITANever heard of her.PUPKIN(pointing to other names)
     And that's Woody Allen and there'sErnie Kovacs -- he's dead -- and that
     one's Lauren Bacall.RITAYou don't really know any of these
     people?PUPKINTake a look at this.

PUPKIN flips to one of the back pages and shows a name toRITA.RITA(squinting)
     I can't make it out.PUPKINTry.RITAThis is really weird handwriting!

Exasperated, PUPKIN follows the name in question with his
index finger.PUPKINRooooper ....RITA(guessing)
     Redford!PUPKINThat'sRobertRedford.RITAIt is?PUPKINNo!    It's ... it's Rupert Pupkin

PUPKIN tears out the page and hands it to her shyly.   RITA
just stares at it and back at PUPKIN.PUPKINDon't lose it. It's going to be worth
     something in a couple of weeks.

RITA start laughing.PUPKINThat's what I've been trying to tell
     you. Things are really breaking for
     me. I'm ticketed for stardom.

RITA laughs harder, despite efforts to be serious.PUPKINOnly a couple of hours ago, I was
     talking to Jerry Langford,theJerry
     Langford. Stop it, Rita!

RITA pulls herself together for a moment.PUPKINWe were talking about my doing my act
     on his show.RITA(suppressing a smile)
     Your act?PUPKINGet    that guy you knew from Clifton out
     of    your head right now. You're looking
     at    Rupert Pupkin, Rita. Rupert Pupkin,
     the    new King of Comedy.

RITA starts laughing hysterically, in spite of herself.RITA(getting a grip on herself)
     I'm sorry.PUPKINWhy not me, Rita? A guy can always
     get what he wants if he's willing to
     pay the price. All it takes is a
     little talent and sacrifice and the
     right break. If you've got a friend
     in the right place, that's all it
     takes. And that's exactly what I
     have going for me right now. After
     all, crazier things have happened.

RITA listens silently for a moment, then begins to giggle.
As PUPKIN resumes speaking, we CUT between RITA and the
YOUNG MAN. Their flirtation picks up steam. The YOUNG MAN
raises his eyebrows as if to ask, "Are you interested in
me?" She smiles. All the while, PUPKIN rattles on.PUPKINYou just don't realize what a shot on
     the Langford Show can mean. That's
     coast to coast, national TV, a bigger
     audience than the greatest comedians
     used to play to in a lifetime. A shot
     like that means a free ticket on the
     comedy circuit -- Flip Wilson one week,
     Cosby the next, then Sonny and Cher or
     Carol Burnett. And you've always got
     those other talk shows to fall back on
     -- Carson, Griffin. And all that leads
     straight in one direction, Rita --
     Hollywood! That's when we really startliving. How does this sound to you --
     a beach house in Malibu, right on the
     ocean. You'll get a beautiful tan,
     believe me. And we'd keep a suite at
     the Sherry. That's the only place to
     stay when you're big. We could get
     something on a top floor and look down
     on all our old friends in Clifton and
     just laugh. How does that sound to you?RITAIt sounds wonderful, Rupert, and I
     really hope you get what you want.
     But it's getting late and I'm a working
     girl. You know what I mean?

The telephone at the back of the restaurant starts ringing.
A WAITER in the background moves slowly to answer it.PUPKINYou going to spend the rest of your
     life in that place? Is that what you
     really want, talking about nothing with
     nothings? I thought you wanted something
     a little better than that and that's what
     I'm offering. Every King needs a Queen,
     Rita. I want you to be mine. What do
     you say?RITAYou really want to help me out? You
     see this. (She points to her lower
     back molar) A hundred seventy-five
     bucks. If you could spare fifty, say,
     until next Monday, that would keep
     three people really happy -- me, my
     landlord and my dentist.

During RITA's speech, the WAITER has been working his way
from the phone booth towards the front of the restaurant.WAITERTelephone for you, Miss.RITA(looking puzzled)
     Me? Nobody knows I'm here.   You didn't
     tell anybody, did you?PUPKINNo.RITA(getting up)
     What the hell's going on?

CAMERA FOLLOWS RITA, who walks to the back of the
restaurant and picks up the dangling receiver in one ofthe two facing booths, the other of which is occupied.14   INT:   THE PHONE BOOTH - NIGHTRITAHello?MAN'S VOICEHi.RITAWho is this?MAN'S VOICEWho do you think it is? I've been
            staring at you all evening.RITAWhere are you?

     The YOUNG MAN taps forcefully with his index finger on the
     glass door of his booth. RITA, hearing the noise, turns
     around and finds herself staring at the YOUNG MAN. She
     smiles.CUT TO:15   INT:   THE RESTAURANT - NIGHTPUPKIN at the table looking over the check. He gets out a
     ten dollar bill. RITA emerges from the booth in nervous
     high spirits.RITA(with repressed gaiety)

            have to go back to work.PUPKINHow did they know you were here?RITA(gathering her things)
            I guess I must have told them.      They
            need someone right away.PUPKIN(accusingly)
            You don't even care, do you?RITAOh, no.   I do. Really!PUPKINIt's not the bar, Rita.    Don't tell
            me it's the bar.RITADon't be angry. It has nothing to
            do with you. I had a nice dinner,
            really. It was great seeing you
            again.

     PUPKIN stare at her icily.RITACome on.    Let's see a smile.PUPKINWhy don't we finish the evening up
            at the bar together? End the evening
            where it began?RITAAfter what happened there?PUPKINWell, I could at least drop you off!RITA(hurriedly making up her face)
            That's okay. Really. I can manage.
            Why don't you just go to a movie or
            something? Don't let me spoil your
            evening.PUPKINBut that wouldn't be right.

     RITA gets up and stands before PUPKIN.RITA(firmly)
            Look, Rupert. It's been a lot of fun,
            really. I'll see you sometime, huh?PUPKINBut Rita!

     RITA starts moving towards the door.RITACome on, Rupert.      I'm in a hurry.

     RITA marches out with PUPKIN trailing behind. He throws
     the check and the ten dollar bill at the CASHIER.16   EXT.   THE STREET - NIGHTCAMERA FOLLOWS PUPKIN as he streaks out the door and jumps
     into the adjacent doorway, immediately peering down the
     street. He spies the YOUNG MAN and RITA walking about
     three quarters of a block down and follows them, keeping
     out of sight. They turn occasionally to see if he's
     around, then stop turning. They go around the corner and
     disappear into a large apartment building. PUPKIN rushesafter them,   positioning himself across from    the building.
     He searches   the windows for some clue as to    where they
     have gone.    Finally a set of lights go on on    the fourth
     floor and a   MAN's shadow is seen closing two    sets of
     blinds.CUT TO:17   INT:   THE APARTMENT BUILDING FOYER - NIGHTPUPKIN enters the building and finds himself in a small
     entranceway. The door to the lobby is locked. Next to
     the door, on the wall, are listed the tenants, their
     apartment numbers and a button next to each name. There is
     an intercom speaker. There are eight apartments listed on

by the hotel in the plainest way. Nicely-done home-made
collages of show business figures decorate the drab green
walls. The room is neat and clean. PUPKIN goes directly

small cassette the other a large table tape recorder. He
picks up the microphone of the larger one and speaks into
it.PUPKINTesting.   Testing.   Testing.

In the following montage, we hear in the background the
replay of his "testing, testing testing" and various
other noises -- a bit of his voice taped, a burst of
laughter, the squeal of a tape recorder sent fast-forward,
a sudden burst of applause, a scrap of theme music. At the
same time, the CAMERA PANS about the room.    We look
at the collages which include all the obvious show business
figures, with a heavy emphasis on comedians from Chaplin
and Keaton to Sid Caesar and Woody Allen. The collages
also include such varied figures as Jimmy Carter, Julia
Childs, Tom Seaver, David Brinkley, Muhammad Ali, Clifford
Irving, Walter Cronkite and Mark Spitz. There is a special
Kennedy section -- John F. and Bobby framed in black,
Jackie in mourning and a picture of Teddy. There is also a
trio of assassins -- Sirhan, Oswald and James Earl Ray.
There is also a talk show collage with a photo of Langford
in the center like a sun surrounded by Snyder, Walters,
Carson and Griffin. One bookshelf holds a veritable
library of comedy -- joke books, biographies of comedians,
treasuries of American humor. Another shelf holds scores
of tapes in their own little boxes, each one neatly marked,

     appreciate it more than you know.

PUPKIN stops the tape recorder and thinks again for a few
beats. He then starts the large recorder.PUPKINNow, Jerry. Before I begin, I just
     want to thank you for listening to
     this material and for the opportunity
     that you've given me. You know, lots
     of people think that guys like you,
     you know, people who have made it,
     lose their feeling for strugglingyoung talent such as myself. But
     now I know from experience that those
     people are just cynics, embittered
     by their own failure. I know, Jerry,
     that you're as human as the rest of us,
     if not more so. (pause) Oh well, I
     guess there's no point going on about
     it. You know how I feel. So let's get
     on with the show.   The best of Rupert
     Pupkin! I've sketched out this little
     introduction in order to save you a
     little time. So close your eyes and
     imagine it's exactly six o'clock.
     You're standing in the wings and we
     hear Rick Ross and the Orchestra strike
     up your theme song.

PUPKIN pushes a button on the cassette and we hear the
theme song of the Jerry Langford Show, followed by the
voice of BERT CANTER, the announcer.BERT CANTER'S VOICEAnd now, direct from New York, it's
     the Jerry Langford Show! Tonight,
     with Jerry's special guest ...

PUPKIN deftly shuts off the cassette and substitutes his
own voice for that of CANTER's. The large tape recorder
keeps rolling.PUPKIN... the comedy find of the year making
     his television debut, Rupert Pupkin, the
     King of Comedy!

PUPKIN rapidly races the cassette tape forward, then pushes
down the "play" button. We hear a burst of thundering
applause. PUPKIN lets the applause run for a while and
then shuts it off. The large recorder keeps rolling.PUPKINNow you come on, Jerry, and do your
     monologue. Then, when the time comes,
     this is how I see you introducing me.
     You'll say something like this.
     "Ladies and Gentlemen we're going to
     do something a little bit different
     tonight. It isn't often that you can
     call someone a sure thing in the
     entertainment business. After all,
     the verdict is always in your hands.
     But I think after you've met my next
     guest, that you'll agree with me that
     he's destined for greatness. So,
     now, will you please give your warmest
     welcome to the newest King of Comedy,
     Rupert Pupkin!!!"PUPKIN pushes the cassette and we hear another enormous
     burst of applause. PUPKIN lets it run, listening intently.
     He stands up and faces a wall of his room, still holding
     the microphone. WE SEE that the wall is covered by a huge
     blow-up of an audience laughing and applauding.CUT TO:45   INT:   THE LANGFORD TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHTWE SEE a real audience laughing and applauding.CUT TO:PUPKIN strides triumphantly onto the stage, nodding to
     acknowledge the applause. He stops center stage as the
     television cameras maneuver about him.CUT TO:A SHOT of the "APPLAUSE" sign flashing, then stopping.
     Still, the applause goes on.CUT TO:PUPKIN    raises his hands to quiet the audience. After a few
     moments    the applause dies down, except for a pair of hands
     in the    center of the orchestra. PUPKIN peers out to see
     who is    still applauding.CUT TO:RITA, in the middle of the audience, applauds
     enthusiastically.CUT TO:PUPKIN on stage.    PUPKIN gives RITA a special smile and
     nod.PUPKINWill somebody tell that lovely lady
            that the applause sign is off.

     The audience laughs.CUT TO:46   INT:   PUPKIN'S ROOM - DAYPUPKIN stands facing the "audience" still holding the mike.PUPKINThat's a possible introduction, Jerry.
            Now let's move on to my act.CUT TO:47   INT:   THE RECEPTION AREA OF THE LANGFORD SHOW - DAYPUPKIN is pacing. He is wearing another suit, this one a
     broad-lapelled-grey. He is freshly shaved, is hair neatly
     combed, his shoes carrying a bright shine. He clutches a
     small flat box, neatly wrapped with the words 'FOR JERRY
     LANGFORD" written clearly across the top in large print.
     CATHY LONG emerges from one of the back corridors into the
     reception area.CATHY LONGYes?PUPKIN(suddenly a bit shy)
            I didn't want to take any chances
            with this ... uh ... Miss Long, so I
            ... uh ... thought I'd just bring it
            here myself.

     He hands CATHY LONG the package as though it contained
     nitroglycerine.CATHY LONGWe talked about this this morning,
            did we, Mr. ... ?PUPKINPupkin.   Rupert Pupkin.CATHY LONGOh, yes. It's been some day. (pause)
            Well, I certainly appreciate your
            bringing this over, Mr. Pupkin, and
            we'll listen to it as soon as possible.PUPKINFine. Er ... you don't have any idea
            how soon that might be?CATHY LONGWell, you can try checking with us
            tomorrow. We might know something
            by then. Otherwise, it'll have to
            be Monday.PUPKINWhat if I just sort of waited around
            here today, just in case? I'll stay
            out of the way.CATHY LONGYou'd just be wasting your time,
            Mr. Pupkin. We won't know anything
            until tomorrow at the earliest.PUPKINOh, I wouldn't consider it a waste oftime at all.    I'd be glad to do it.CATHY LONGLook, why don't you try us tomorrow.
            Okay?PUPKINTomorrow? ... Right. I'll do that.
            Thanks a lot, Miss Long. And thank
            Jerry.

     CATHY LONG smiles at     PUPKIN and    goes, leaving PUPKIN
     staring at a picture     of LANGFORD    on the wall. WE FIX on
     LANGFORD a moment and     PULL BACK    to see LANGFORD in what
     PUPKIN would imagine     his office    to be.48   INT:   AN OFFICE - DAYA large, corner office furnished in royal red, with high
     ceilings and a huge desk. Potted palms and hydrangeas rest
     on a marble floor. LANGFORD is moving about restlessly,
     clutching PUPKIN's tape in one hand and waving it about.
     PUPKIN is seated on a comfortable couch.LANGFORDDynamite!    This is dynamite!PUPKIN(shyly)
            You think so, Jerry?LANGFORDLook, I've been at this for fifteen
            years, Rupert, and I haven't come up
            with anything like this -- not me,
            not any of my writers.PUPKIN(smiling with obvious
                  pleasure)
            Well, I'm glad you like it, Jerry.LANGFORDTell me something, Rube. (pause)
            How do you do it? I'm not asking
            to use the material myself. I just
            want to know how you (LANGFORD waves
            his arms in a gesture of frustration)

            it, really.LANGFORDCome on.    Try, Rube.PUPKINWell,    it just sort of comes. I think
            about    my life, see, mainly about the
            worst    parts, all the awful things, and
            I just    try to see them in a funny light.
            That's    all.LANGFORD(eagerly)
            Is that what you do? The worst parts,
            and then you look at them in a funny
            light? Is that what you do?PUPKINMore or less. It's hard to describe
            how its happens.LANGFORDBut that's just it, Rube. It doesn't
            happen for me. Why do you think the
            show is in so much trouble? By the
            time I've done my monologue, everyone
            has switched to Carson. Maybe if you
            did a little writing ... ?PUPKINSure, Jerry, I'd do anything I could
            to help out.LANGFORDYou would? Great. Why don't you
            come out to my place this weekend
            and we'll hash it out. I'm having
            a few of my friends but we should be
            able to get a little work in.PUPKINWould you mind if I brought someone?LANGFORD(smiling)
            A girl, Rube?PUPKINA very special girl, Jerry.LANGFORDI'd love to meet her.49   THE HIGH-RISE OFFICE BUILDING ON UPPER BROADWAY - DAYPUPKIN emerges, lost in thought. Suddenly he notices
     MARSHA waiting nearby. She doesn't see PUPKIN. He sneaks
     off.CUT TO:50   EXT:   U.N. PLAZA - DAYIt is a bright morning. LANGFORD, attempting to camouflage
     himself by wearing a cap over his eyes and his trench coat
     collar turned up, his eyes hidden behind dark glasses,
     walks out of the building. A DOORMAN is standing by the
     door.DOORMANCab, Jerry?LANGFORDThat's alright, thanks.

     WE FOLLOW LANGFORD as he walks. Some people don't notice.
     Others stare but leave him alone, a few commenting to their
     companions and pointing at him. A CAB DRIVER pulls
     alongside.DRIVERHey, Jerry. My brother can sing
            and juggle at the same time. How
            about puttin' him on your show?

     eyes.WOMANYou know something.   (She giggles)
            I undress in front of you every night
            and Larry here doesn't mind at all.LARRYI can't get anything started with her
            until you're off the air. Your show
            is ruining my sex life, Jerry.LANGFORDWell then, you'll just have to put
            on a better show than I do.CUT TO:52   EXT:   BROADWAY, A FEW BLOCKS SOUTH OF LANGFORD'S OFFICES -DAYWE WATCH LANGFORD continue to walk, feeling what it is to
     be a celebrity out in public. After a few beats, weCUT TO:53   EXT:   BROADWAY - DAYWE SEE MARSHA trailing LANGFORD. LANGFORD notices her and
     starts walking quickly. MARSHA walks quickly. LANGFORD
     starts jogging. MARSHA starts jogging. Finally, LANGFORD
     breaks into a sprint. MARSHA runs after him. LANGFORD
     disappears into his office building. MARSHA arrives
     several seconds later.MARSHAJerry!     God damnit!

     Just as MARSHA turns around, PUPKIN, unaware of her, walks
     cheerfully into the building.CUT TO:54   INT:   RECEPTION AREA OF JERRY LANGFORD SHOW OFFICES - DAYPUPKIN enters. The same middle-aged, plump RECEPTIONIST
     is seated behind the desk.RECEPTIONISTYes, sir?     (recognizing him)   Oh, hi.PUPKINHi.   How are you?RECEPTIONISTNot bad.PUPKINI'm fine.RECEPTIONISTCan I help you?PUPKINI'd like to see Jerry, please.RECEPTIONISTYou are ... ?PUPKINMr. Pupkin.RECEPTIONISTJust a minute.The RECEPTIONIST dials a number.RECEPTIONISTMr. Pupkin is here ...

     will take care of you.PUPKINAlright.

PUPKIN paces for a few beats. He smiles at the
RECEPTIONIST. A beat later, CATHY LONG comes out,
carrying the tape in its box.CATHY LONGMr. Pupkin?PUPKINHow are you today?CATHY LONGFine, Mr. Pupkin. Thank you for
     your tape. We listened to it with
     great interest. And, frankly, Mr. Pupkin,
     we saw a lot of good things in what
     you're doing. We feel you have good
     potential. Very good potential.PUPKIN(smiling)
     Thanks.CATHY LONGThat's why I'll be honest with you,

     Not ready?CATHY LONGWell, we just don't feel right now
that you're right for Jerry.PUPKIN(rapidly, half-listening)
Right for Jerry. Sure.CATHY LONGSome of the material ... some of the
one-liners, for instance ...PUPKINYes?CATHY LONG... were not very strong.PUPKINYou didn't care for some of the jokes,
is that it?CATHY LONGThat"s right.PUPKINGood. Good. I can take care of
that right way. Thanks. Just tell
me the ones you think should go.
That would be a big help. (to the
RECEPTIONIST) This is great. (to
CATHY LONG) Which ones?CATHY LONGWell, it's not just that, Mr. Pupkin.
You see, Jerry likes to panel his
guests, you know, chat with them
afterwards.PUPKINSure.   Sure.CATHY LONGAnd frankly, we just don't feel you've
got very much to talk about right now.PUPKINBut I've got my whole life to talk
about!CATHY LONGWhich is interesting to you, I'm sure
and to your wife ... and to a few
friends. But we feel that you should
keep developing your act. Test it in
some live situations. There are a
number of clubs in the city you cantry. And after a reasonable period,
     get in touch with us again and we'll
     be glad to send someone down to check
     out your progress.

PUPKIN stares at her for a few moments as the tension grows.PUPKINMay I ask you a question, Miss Long?CATHY LONGOf course.PUPKINAre you speaking for Jerry?CATHY LONGLet's put it this way, Mr. Pupkin.
     Mr. Langford has complete faith in
     our judgment.PUPKINI'm sorry to have to say this, Miss
     Long, and I certainly don't want you
     to take it personally, but I have to
     tell you that Idon't... Idon'thave faith in your judgment.CATHY LONGWell, I'm sorry you feel that way,
     Mr. Pupkin. But I'm afraid there's
     nothing that can be done about that.PUPKINNo ... No ... I'm afraid I'll have
     to disagree with you again.CATHY LONG(with strained politeness)
     That's your privilege, Mr. Pupkin.
     Now, if you'll excuse me, please, I
     have some things to do. I'm sorry
     the news isn't better.

CATHY LONG turns to go.PUPKINMiss Long?

CATHY LONG turns back.PUPKINWhen are you expecting Jerry in?CATHY LONGHe won't be in until very late this
     afternoon.PUPKINThat's fine. Thank you.

CATHY LONG stares at PUPKIN for a moment, glances at the
RECEPTIONIST and then goes. PUPKIN takes a seat in the
reception area. He smiles once more at the RECEPTIONIST.
The RECEPTIONIST drops her eyes. A few beats go by. CATHY
LONG passes by the entranceway and glances at PUPKIN.
PUPKIN continues sitting there.RECEPTIONISTIs there anyone else you would
     like to see?PUPKINThat's alright. I'm happy just
     waiting.

A few beats pass in silence.RECEPTIONISTWell, would you mind waiting outside,
     please, Mr. Pupkin? This is a reception
     area, not a waiting room.PUPKINI understand.

PUPKIN remains seated. A few more moments pass. Several
OFFICE PERSONNEL pass by the entranceway and glance at
PUPKIN. After a few more beats, a large, plainly-dressed
MAN in his mid-fifties emerges from the back offices. He
goes over to PUPKIN, who stands.OFFICIALMr. Pupkin? I'm Raymond Wirtz, in
     charge of security for the Langford
     organization.

WIRTZ puts his arm on PUPKIN's shoulder and, as the
following dialogue unfolds leads him out the door, down
the corridor and into the elevator.WIRTZNow I think you understand that we
     have certain rules here that are
     essential to the smooth functioning
     of our operation.PUPKINSure.     Sure.WIRTZAnd that without these rules, we really
     wouldn't be able to function at our
     best. You follow my point?

PUPKIN nods.WIRTZNow one of these rules is that only
            authorized personnel and those having
            official business with our organization
            are permitted on our premises. And
            that's why I'm asking you, Mr. Pupkin,
            to cooperate with us.

     They have reached the elevator and WIRTZ has pushed the
     button.PUPKINYou want me to leave the building.WIRTZThat's right. It's nothing personal,
            Mr. Pupkin. Just doing my job.

     The elevator arrives. WIRTZ signals with his head that
     PUPKIN should enter. PUPKIN gets in.WIRTZHave a pleasant day.CUT TO:55   EXT:   STREET OUTSIDE THE LANGFORD BUILDING - DAYPUPKIN comes out and takes up a position outside the door,
     preparing to wait for LANGFORD. MARSHA sees him and comes

     The RECEPTIONIST starts making a call inside. PUPKIN
     glances at her and walks right in to the inner corridors.
     He starts peering into the open doors of the offices that
     line the corridor. The whole place is like a gigantic
     maze. OFFICE PERSONNEL pass by him, taking no notice of
     him. He continues wandering around desperately, completely
     lost. A few beat later, he spots WIRTZ leading a pair of
     SECURITY GUARDS. PUPKIN keeps peering into offices quickly
     as he flees. The GUARDS and WIRTZ finally catch up to
     PUPKIN at the steno pool and, after a brief chase around
     the pool, they catch PUPKIN and subdue him. They start
     dragging him out past the eyes of the OFFICE PERSONNEL.PUPKIN(calling as he is dragged)

     SEE him talking to RITA. He is voluble, animated. She
     looks skeptical, with a wry smile on her face. Finally WE
     WATCH him extract an answer from her. She shrugs, smiles
     and says yes. He comes walking out the door, his hounded

            least they help you get to sleep.

     There is a pause.RITA(glumly)
            Boy, this is going to be some great
            weekend.   I thought we were gonna
            have some fun.PUPKIN(smiling)
            Just take it easy, Rita.     Everything's
            going to be fine.

     WE MOVE IN for a CLOSE-UP of PUPKIN who is fading out.FADE TO:63   EXT:   A NEO-CLASSICAL MANSIONIt is a large white house with colonial columns set in the
     middle of a palatial estate whose rolling lawns are
     punctuated with fine old trees. We circle around to the
     back where LANGFORD, a handful of his FRIENDS (which can be
     familiar television celebrities) and PUPKIN and RITA are
     just finishing a lavish lunch on the patio. A pair of
     SERVANTS are clearing the table and serving the coffee and
     desert as the scene unfolds. As we arrive, we hear a loud
     burst of laughter. PUPKIN is regaling the COMPANY withstories.PUPKINOh, you have no idea how bad it's
     gotten in New York. Now the muggers
     are so efficient that, each time
     they jump you, they take your name
     and address and put you on a mailing
     list. (the COMPANY chuckles) And
     once you're on the list, you're inrealtrouble, like this friend of
     mine who was mugged thirty-two times
     on his way home from work. (a little
     laughter from the COMPANY)

A SERVANT places the desert, a little, elegant tart, in
front of PUPKIN and RITA.PUPKIN(to SERVANT)
     Thanks.

The SERVANT smiles. As PUPKIN continues his story, he
glances occasionally at RITA who has begun to nibble at her
tart. PUPKIN also glances conspiratorially at LANGFORD
who smiles back.PUPKINSo what my friend does is get himself
     a dog, one of those huge German
     Shepherds. One night, he's walking
     the dog in Central Park when he hears
     this voice behind him. (in a German
     accent) Okay, Harry, drop your
     vallet and keep your hantz over your
     head or I bite your little fanny off.

The COMPANY breaks up.ONE GUEST(to LANGFORD)
     Looks like you've found yourself a
     winner, Jerry.LANGFORD(looking at PUPKIN)
     He's the one who found himself
     a winner.

RITA looks up, smiles and blushes. The rest of the COMPANY
smiles benignly and grows attentive as RITA returns to
eating her tart. Suddenly she bites down on something
hard. She fishes it out of her mouth and looks at it. The
COMPANY giggles. It is the ring PUPKIN purchased at
Cartier's. The COMPANY applauds lightly and laughs.
LANGFORD lifts his wine glass.LANGFORDTo Rita and Rupert -- a short engagement
            and a long, happy marriage.

     The COMPANY drinks with murmurs of "Hear! Hear!"   RITA
     and PUPKIN beam. RITA looks lovingly at PUPKIN.A SECOND GUEST(the PUPKIN)
            Have you set a date?PUPKIN(looking pointedly at LANGFORD)
            Oh, yes.A THIRD GUESTI hope we're all invited.PUPKINEveryone's invited.CUT TO:64   INT:   THE LANGFORD TELEVISION STUDIOThe theater is packed. World Series bunting hangs from the
     balcony and the front of the stage. We hear RICK ROSS and
     the ORCHESTRA strike up Mendelssohn's Wedding March.   Down
     one aisle walks RITA, accompanied by the MAN whom PUPKIN
     hit over the head at the bar. Down the other aisle marches
     PUPKIN, accompanied by LANGFORD. The AUDIENCE cheers
     wildly. The two COUPLES walk to the stage where a white-
     haired OFFICIAL awaits them. BERT CANTER stands at his
     side. PUPKIN and RITA disengage from their ESCORTS and
     stand before the OFFICIAL. The music stops and the
     AUDIENCE grows quiet.OFFICIALWe are met here in these extraordinary
            circumstances to join this man and this
            woman in holy wedlock. But, before we
            begin, let me voice a personal word
            of thanks to you, Rupert and to you,
            Rita, for choosing me to perform this
            prestigious ceremony. Because we are
            on prime time, I am going to discard
            my customary remarks in favor of a
            few personal reflections.   When I was
            principal at Clifton High and these
            two were students, I had very little
            faith that Rupert here would amount
            to very much. But like his teachers
            and his fellow students, I underestimated
            this fine young man.   Some say that
            this misjudgment is directly tied to my
            recent dismissal as head of the Clifton
            School System. But let me take this
            opportunity to set the record straight.
            Knowing that Rupert and Rita here weremost certainly destined for a great
            career and a lifetime of happiness,
            I voluntarily stepped down. I would
            only here add my own wishes to those
            of millions of viewers for their
            continued health, wealth and
            boundless success.

     The OFFICIAL looks quickly past RITA and PUPKIN.OFFICIALWe'll be back to marry them in a minute,
            right after this word.FADE TO:65   INT:   THE TRAIN - DAYPUPKIN and RITA are seated as they were.      We hear the
     CONDUCTOR calling.CONDUCTOR'S VOICEGreenwich.    Greenwich next stop.
            Greenwich.

     PUPKIN and RITA grab their small suitcases and quickly move
     down the aisle towards the door.CUT TO:66   INT:   A SUBURBAN TAXI - DAYRITA is peering out the window.     PUPKIN is still lost in
     thought.RITALook at that one. How'd you like to
            live in that?!?! Or that one! What
            do you figure these run?

     The taxi stops in front of a walled lot behind which is
     visible a handsome English stucco home.PUPKIN(to DRIVER)
            What's this?DRIVERThis is it.RITAIt's gorgeous!

     PUPKIN is genuinely puzzled.PUPKIN(to DRIVER)
            You sure?DRIVERLook, friend, I wouldn't want to
            tell you how many times I made this
            trip.   (pause)    That'll be three
            seventy-five.

     PUPKIN, still puzzled, hands him a five dollar bill.PUPKIN(abstractedly)
            Keep it.

     The DRIVER gets out and puts PUPKIN and RITA's bags,
     which he had stacked on the front seat, onto the sidewalk.DRIVERThanks. If you need a ride back,
            just ask the guy for Wayne. That's me.

     The CAMERA PULLS BACK as PUPKIN opens the gate and he and
     RITA walk up the drive.CUT TO:67   EXT:   LANGFORD'S HOUSE - DAYPUPKIN and RITA stand before the front door. PUPKIN rings,
     After a few beats, the door is opened by an Indonesian
     HOUSEBOY. PUPKIN walks in right past him, RITA following
     behind.CUT TO:68   INT:   LANGFORD'S HOUSE - DAYPUPKIN hands the HOUSEBOY the two suitcases as he talks.PUPKINYou must be Jonno. I'm Rupert Pupkin
            and this is Rita Keane. Mr. Langford's
            expecting us.

     Jonno nods politely but uncertainly.JONNO(uncertain)
            Mr. Langford asked you to come?PUPKINThat's right. Would you mind
            taking those up? Jerry and I have
            some work that may oblige me to
            stay overnight.JONNOBut Mr. Langford's not here.PUPKINOut playing golf, right?JONNO(still puzzled and unsure)
            That's right.PUPKINMaybe he'll finally break a hundred.JONNOMaybe it's better if you came back ...PUPKIN(interrupting)
            That's alright. We don't mind waiting.

     PUPKIN walks from the foyer into the living-room, leaving
     JONNO staring after him holding the bags. RITA walks into
     the living room after PUPKIN.RITA(worried)
            The table's only set for one.PUPKINThat's from breakfast.     Relax, will
            you?CUT TO:69   INT:   LANGFORD'S KITCHEN - DAYJONNO is on the phone.   A black lady COOK stands at his
     side.JONNO(into the phone)
            Let me talk to Jerry Langford please
            ... I know he is ... It's important.CUT TO:70   INT:   LANGFORD'S LIVING ROOM - DAYIt is a handsomely furnished room, done in old American
     antiques and other tasteful pieces. There is a grand piano
     heavy with pictures in one corner and wall-to-wall
     bookshelves that are mostly full and mixed with a balance
     of classics and modern popular reading. The whole room
     marks LANGFORD as a man of discernment. The shelves also
     house a fine stereo and a small, discreet bar. RITA and
     PUPKIN walk in like strangers in paradise, awed by the
     obvious elegance and expense the room reflects.PUPKIN(as though he owned it)
            How do you like it?RITA(admiringly)
     I could live here.PUPKIN(smiling proudly)
     It's the only waytolive.

RITA stands in the center of the room, ill at ease, while
PUPKIN strolls about comfortably, picking up an ashtray
here, a cigarette case there, inspecting the artifacts for
inscriptions, clues, hints about LANGFORD's character and
life.RITAHow come he isn't here?PUPKINYou heard the guy.     He's out playing
     golf.RITADidn't you tell him when we'd get here?

PUPKIN continues to move about the room, fielding RITA's
suspicious inquiries effortlessly.PUPKINWe didn't have time to iron out the
     details. Now just relax. We're
     the first guests, that's all.RITA(interrupting)
     That Jonno character hadn't even
     heard of us!PUPKIN(a little irritated)
     It probably slipped Jerry's mind.
     He has better things to think about
     than what he tells his houseboy.RITAIt's just not time way I expected it,
     that's all.

There is a pause. PUPKIN continues his investigation.      He
has moved to the grand piano in the rear of the room.RITAWhat do we do now?

PUPKIN is looking    at a picture of an American Gothic couple
standing in front    of a wood-frame house. As he comments on
the pictures, the    CAMERA PANS over them. They form a kind
of slide-show of    LANGFORD's life.PUPKINThese are Jerry's parents. His father
     runs the Post office in Wolverine --
     that's in North Dakota.

PUPKIN then fixes on a picture of an eleven-year-old boy
standing next to a puppet stage with a puppet (obviously
held by the boy) staring at its master.PUPKINThis one was in Newsweek. He started
     giving these puppet shows when he was
     still in grade school.

WE SEE a picture of a very young LANGFORD seated before a
microphone with some celebrity.PUPKINAnd this is from his quiz show in
     St. Louis. Can you believe it?RITASure I can.PUPKINThat was the name of the show.

WE MOVE to a picture of LANGFORD smiling at JACK PAAR.PUPKINAnd here's when he wrote for Jack
     Paar. He made a hundred and fifty
     a week and look at him now.

Another picture of LANGFORD with a group of women sitting
in a studio.PUPKINAnd this is his morning show.

A picture of LANGFORD standing in a park with his two boys,
eleven and eight.PUPKINAnd his kids. He's divorced.

RITA, who has been only half-listening, has picked up a
small, beautifully enameled cigarette box.RITALook at this. I love these kind of
     things. Look at the work.   I've got
     this thing about boxes.

RITA puts it down reluctantly, picks it up, then puts it
down again.CUT TO:71   INT:   THE KITCHEN - DAYJONNO is holding the phone, waiting.     The COOK stands,
     looking at him.JONNOMr. Langford? ... I'm sorry to
            disturb you ...CUT TO:72   INT:   THE LIVING ROOM - DAYRITA has just finished fixing herself a drink. She takes a
     large sip and starts pacing around. PUPKIN is seated.RITAHow much longer are we gonna have
            to wait?PUPKINI don't know. Until he gets back.RITA.Do we have to just sit here?PUPKINHe should be back pretty soon.RITADoesn't he have any music or anything?
            Let's get a little life into this place.
            It's like a funeral parlor.

     She walks over to the stereo and opens the cupboard beneath
     it, revealing rows and rows of records.RITAThis is more like it.

     She pulls out a record.PUPKINCome on, Rita.RITACome on, yourself.

     She puts the record on. Frank Sinatra starts singing "They
     Can't Take That Away From Me." She takes a big sip of her
     drink, puts it down and comes over to PUPKIN.RITAHow about a little spin, handsome?PUPKIN(pulling back)
            Here?

     RITA snuggles into PUPKIN and starts dancing him around.
     He resists feebly.RITACome on, Rupert.      I came up here for
            a good time.

     PUPKIN gives in and starts      dancing with her in the    style of
     the 1950's, elbow out, arm      up, box step. After a     few
     moments, PUPKIN closes his      eyes. He has reached a     moment
     of perfect bliss, his dream      girl in is arms. They     dance
     silently as we hear Sinatra      singing.SINATRA'S VOICEThe way you wore your hat,
            The way we danced till three,

            No ... they can't take that away ...
            from ... me.

     The orchestra plays.RITAYou never could dance, could you?PUPKINHow would you know?RITAOh I danced with you a couple of
            times -- at the Sigma U party.PUPKINYou were there with Tommy Winston.RITAYou didn't ask me.PUPKINThat's the one time Ididask you
            and you went with him anyway.RITAWell, I couldn't go withyou!PUPKINWhy not?RITABe serious, Rupert.CUT TO:73   INT:   THE DINING ROOM - DAYJONNO stands a few feet from the kitchen door, staring at
     RITA and PUPKIN dancing in the living room, an unbelieving,
     anxious expression on his face.CUT TO:74   INT:   THE LIVING ROOM - DAYThe music has stopped momentarily and PUPKIN and RITA
     disengage. PUPKIN looks lovingly at RITA.PUPKINWell, it's all ended happily and
            that's what counts.

     RITA grows jumpy under his gaze.      She looks around.RITAI wonder what the rest of this
            place looks like?PUPKINI'm sure it's all very nice.RITA(gaily)
            Well, there's only one way to find out.

     RITA scampers over to the stairs and pauses on the first
     step.RITAYou coming or not?

     RITA bounds up the stairs.PUPKINRita!

     CAMERA FOLLOWS PUPKIN up the stairs.CUT TO:75   INT:   UPSTAIRS - DAYThere is no sign of RITA.PUPKINWhere are you?

     There is no answer. CAMERA FOLLOWS PUPKIN from room to
     room. They are all guest rooms, neat, pretty, clean.PUPKINCome on, Rita. This isn't funny.

     Finally, PUPKIN opens the door to another room.CUT TO:76   INT:   A BEDROOM - DAYIt is clearly LANGFORD's bedroom with a few clothes strewn
     about, and other signs of being lived in. RITA lies on the
     bed.PUPKIN(shocked)
            What are you doing, Rita?RITAI love it! All those millions of
            women out there dying to change

            little fun, for Christ's sake.

            whole apartment.

     PUPKIN enters the large, beautifully done bathroom.   RITA
     examines her face in the mirror.PUPKIN(urgently)
            Let's go, Rita.RITABoy, I really need some sun.PUPKINRita, this is Jerry's ...RITALay off, will you, Rupert.PUPKINBut we have no right ...

     RITA picks up a can of shave cream and squirts a large
     dollop in PUPKIN's face. WE COME IN for a CLOSE UP of
     PUPKIN's face, buried under shaving cream.PUPKINThat wasn't funny, Rita.

     RITA hands him a towel.RITAHere.

     She looks around.RITANow for something that smells nice.

     She swings open the cabinet with a flourish. The door
     swings open violently and the mirror shatters against
     something as pills and bottles tumble into the sink.
     PUPKIN and RITA stand there, staring at each other. RITA
     begins to laugh, but her laugh is cut short by the slam of
     the downstairs door.CUT TO:78   INT:   THE FOYERLANGFORD has entered, drawn and businesslike.       JONNO and
     the COOK have moved out to greet him.LANGFORD(looking around)
            Where are they?JONNOI was going to call the police but
            then I thought to myself 'what if
            they are Mr. Langford's friends?'

     We hear some whispers and scuffling at the top of the
     stairs. LANGFORD, JONNO and the COOK look up. PUPKIN
     comes bounding down the stairs jauntily with RITA following
     cautiously behind. PUPKIN has large traces of shaving
     cream behind his ears and on his neck.PUPKINHi, Jerry.   We were just freshening up.

     PUPKIN stops at the base of the stairs, turns around, and
     waves RITA down.PUPKIN(to RITA)
            Come on, Rita. No need to be shy.

     PUPKIN smiles conspiratorially at LANGFORD.       RITA comes
     slowly down.PUPKINJerry, I'd like you to meet Rita
            Keane. Rita, say hello to Jerry!RITA(tentatively)
     Pleased to meet you.

LANGFORD nods imperceptibly, his face tense, his eyes
alert. RITA, reading her frigid reception, looks to
PUPKIN who walks blithely past LANGFORD into the living
room, toward the bar.PUPKINWhat's your pleasure?

PUPKIN glances at the small mess he has left on the bar and
turns back to LANGFORD who has moved into the living room
with JONNO and the COOK a few steps behind. PUPKIN flashes
LANGFORD an apologetic smile.PUPKIN(to LANGFORD)
     We've already taken the liberty, so
     to speak. Rita was a little nervous.
     It isn't every day she meets someone
     like you.LANGFORDWhat's going on here?PUPKINWe've been sitting around, waiting.
     That's all. How was your golf game?JONNOI told them you weren't here.COOKThat's right.PUPKINHe did, Jerry. He was very helpful.
     We had to take an early train. There
     was nothing else until after one.

     It's upstairs, in my bags. (pause)
     Where is everybody?LANGFORDWho?PUPKINThe other guests! (in a confidential
     tone) We're getting a little hungry,
     to tell you the truth.LANGFORD(as though confirming
           what PUPKIN said)
     You are.PUPKIN(backing off)
     But we don't mind waiting, do we,
     Rita?

RITA says nothing. She has sensed something terribly
wrong and is slowly backing away from PUPKIN.LANGFORDYou know, I could have you arrested,
     both of you.PUPKIN(seizing the idea)
     You know you could! And there'd be
     absolutely no way we could prove we
     belonged here. I never thought of that.LANGFORDWell, youshouldhave before you ...PUPKIN(still fixed on the idea)
     Maybe we could work up a routine
     about that, about a guy who throws
     all his friends in jail. Let's talk
     about that.LANGFORD(sharply)
     Let'snot.PUPKINSure, Jerry. Whatever you ...LANGFORD(exasperated)
     Look, if you've got something for
     me to sign, let's have it and get
     it over with so I can get back ...PUPKIN(interrupting)
     That wouldn't be right, Jerry.
     Not in your own house!LANGFORD(summoning his last
           bit of patience)
     I have a lot of work to get to.
     (to JONNO) How did they get here?PUPKINWe took a taxi, Jerry ... But don't
     worry about us. You go ahead and
     do your work and we'll just take a
     stroll around until lunch is ready.LANGFORDYou're a little thick, aren't you?PUPKIN(smiling as though complimented)
     Well, maybe a ...RITAWhat's he's saying, Rupert, is that he
     wants us out.PUPKINDon't listen to her, Jerry. She
     doesn't understand anything about us.RITADon't get me into this.LANGFORD(to JONNO)
     Call the station.

JONNO goes back into the foyer, followed by the COOK.LANGFORDThere'll be a cab here in a few
     minutes. Now if you'll just wait
     at the gate ...PUPKINLook, Jerry, if I've said anything
     out of line, let's chalk it up to
     inexperience, okay? I'll just go
     upstairs and get my tape and we can
     start working. It shouldn't take
     long and then you'll have the rest of
     the afternoon to yourself.LANGFORDI've told you just as clearly as I
     can. I want you out of here and I
     want you out now. Scram, beat it,
     vamoose, out! Is that plain enough!

RITA deftly pockets the enamel box.PUPKINBut what about my material?    When
     are we going to go over it?RITACome on, Rupert, the man wants us
     to go.PUPKINTell her she's wrong, Jerry!RITALook, Mr. Langford. I didn't know
     anything about all this. I hardly
     know this guy. I haven't seen him
     in years.PUPKINRita!RITASo if there's anything I can do, any
     way I can make this up to you.PUPKINShe's nothing, Jerry. She's just
     some girl who works in a bar.
     Don't let her spoil things.

LANGFORD starts herding RITA and PUPKIN towards the door.LANGFORDCome on.   Let's go.PUPKINAll I'm asking is fifteen minutes.
     That's all. Just long enough to
     listen to my act. Is that asking
     too much -- fifteen minutes of your
     day against my whole life?LANGFORDI'll call the police if I have to.

LANGFORD realizes he is being hard.    He stops for a moment.LANGFORDI have my own life, that's all.PUPKINBut what aboutme, Jerry? What aboutmylife? I made plans -- based on
     whatyousaid. You can't just turn
     your back on me.LANGFORDI'm not telling you again.

just stares at LANGFORD with disbelief that turns to anger.PUPKINSo this is the way it   works when
     you're big, huh? You    just play with
     people. Is that part    of the kick,

            my friend at all, were you? You were
            just playing some kind of game with me.
            Well, that's not going to stop me,
            Jerry. I'm just going to work a
            little bit harder, that's all, use a
            little bit more enterprise. And not
            count on anybody. That's where I
            made my mistake. I can see that now.

     for a woman of fifty. MARSHA has imprinted her own stamp
     on the apartment in two ways: First, the place is abso-
     lutely chaotic. Secondly, there are a number of blow-up
     pictures on the wall. A picture of LANGFORD sits on the
     bureau. There is a big brass bed with an ornate brass
     frame at the foot. LANGFORD stares at MARSHA and PUPKIN.
     PUPKIN closes the blinds and turns on the lights. MARSHA
     trains the gun on LANGFORD. PUPKIN finishes his work and
     takes the gun back.PUPKINI didn't like being so rough out
            there, Jerry. But I wanted you to
            know that I meant business. I didn't
            want anything happening to you over
            some misunderstanding.

     LANGFORD just stares at him, frozen with fear.PUPKINNow I know you're wondering    what
            this is all about. Actually     you've
            got nothing to worry about.     You
            just do what I tell you and    by, say,

            you understand? This is an emergency... NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS!CUT TO:98   INT:   MARSHA'S APARTMENT - DAYLANGFORD is seated on a chair whose back is pressed right
up against the high, ornate brass bedstead at the foot of
the bed. MARSHA trains the gun on LANGFORD now. PUPKIN
is unpacking a suitcase. He takes out a handsome blue suit,
ruffled shirt, a bow tie, black shoes, underwear, socks,
shaving equipment, soap, a hairbrush, a clothesbrush, a
small shoe shine kit, aftershave lotion, deodorant and a
dozen or so rolls of inch-and-a-half wide adhesive tape.
He removes this stuff from a suitcase that is barely big
enough to hold it -- so the mere packing of all this para-
phernalia into such a small space represents something of an
achievement. As he takes the stuff out, he talks to
LANGFORD, his back turned to him.PUPKINThis wasn't an easy decision for
     me, Jerry, believe me. For one
     thing, I knew it meant we could never
     be friends again and that hurt me.
     It's hard to lose a friend, even one
     who has let you down. You always
     hope you can patch things up. You
     know, a guy like me doesn't make
     friends that easily.

PUPKIN pauses a moment, then turns to LANGFORD, his voice
filled with emotion.PUPKINWhy didn't you just listen to the
     tape when I asked you? Then I
     wouldn't have to be doing all this.
     Was it really too much to expect --
     a few minutes of your time to listen
     to something I'd worked on my whole
     life?

LANGFORD's eyes shift rapidly.   He is obviously calculating
how to deal with PUPKIN.LANGFORD(with disarming charm)
     Hey, if that's what's bothering you,
     let's go over to my office and listen
     to that tape right now.PUPKINAre you crazy, Jerry? Do you know
     what would happen to me?

MARSHA listens to this exchange a bit nervously.   Gesturing
to her gun, she says:MARSHAAm I going to have to hold this
     thing all day?

PUPKIN sees she has lowered it practically to her side.PUPKIN(to MARSHA)
     Just keep it on him. (to LANGFORD)
     You know, Jerry. Friendship is a two-
     way street. All that time I was
     worrying about you and your ratings
     and everything, you couldn't have
     cared less about me.

LANGFORD thinks rapidly for a beat or two.LANGFORDYou're right. You know that? I
     was thoughtless. It's just that
     when you're doing a big show, it's
     hard to tell who your friends really
     are. I was wrong. I apologize.
     Why don't we just shake hands and
     forget the whole thing?PUPKIN(suspiciously)
     That's easy to say, Jerry.LANGFORDBut I mean it. I'll tell     them that
     the whole thing was a joke    and then
     we can go to my office and    listen to
     that tape. Come on. What      do you say?

LANGFORD rises with his hand extended toward PUPKIN.MARSHA(to LANGFORD, sharply)
     Sit down!

LANGFORD looks to PUPKIN.MARSHAI saidsit!

LANGFORD reluctantly sits down.PUPKIN(to MARSHA)
     What's the matter?     You heard
     what he said.MARSHAAll of a sudden, with a gun on him,
     he wants to make up and be friends.
     And, once he's out the door, what
     happens then?PUPKINWhat happens then, Jerry?MARSHAYou get to his office and they
            jump you, that's what happens, Rupert.PUPKINShe's right, Jerry.LANGFORDNot if I tell them not to. This is
            Jerry, Rupert, I give you my word.PUPKIN(to MARSHA)

            Rupert, I'm sick of waiting.PUPKINAnd what else, Jerry?LANGFORDCome on, Rupert. My word's good
            enough, isn't it.

     PUPKIN stares at LANGFORD for a few beats. Then he shakes
     his head sadly and says in a very quiet, discouraged voice.PUPKINNo, Jerry. It's not. (to MARSHA)
            Keep the gunup!

     PUPKIN comes over to LANGFORD with a few rolls of adhesive
     tape in his hand.PUPKINI'm sorry to do it this way, Jerry,
            but I'm no good at knots. Just put
            your arms up and out, okay?

     LANGFORD spreads his arms back against the brass bedstead.
     As PUPKIN goes to tape them, LANGFORD tries to grab him,
     but, with sudden, demonic force, PUPKIN pins him against
     the bedstead. They are practically nose to nose.PUPKINOh, no, Jerry. None of that.      Now

      have ever seen him.PUPKINGood evening, ladies and gentleman.
             Let me introduce myself. My name is
             Rupert Pupkin. I was born in Clifton,
             New Jersey, which was not, at that
             time, a federal offense. (laughter)
             Is there anyone here from Clifton?
             (silence) Good. We can all relax.
             Now, I'd like to begin by saying that
             my parents were too poor to afford me
             a childhood but the fact is nobody is
             allowed to be really poor in Clifton.
             Once you fall below eleven thousand
             you're exiled to Passaic. My parents
             did, in fact, put down the first two
             payments on my childhood. Then they
             tried to return me to the hospital
             as defective.   But, like everyone else
             I grew up in large part thanks to my
             mother. If she was only here today
             I'd say, "Hey, mom. What are you
             doing here? You've been dead for
             nine years?" (laughter) You should
             have seen my mother. She was wonderful
             -- blonde, beautiful, intelligent,
             alcoholic. (laughter) We used to
             drink milk together after school.
             Mine was homogenized. Hers was loaded.
             (laughter) Once she was picked up for
             speeding. They clocked her doing fifty
             -- in our garage. (laughter) When
             they tested her they found that her
             alcohol was two per cent blood. They
             took away her license and she died
             shortly afterwards. We used to joke
             together Mom and me, until the tears
             would stream down her face and she'dthrow up. (laughter) And who would
             clean it up? Not Dad. He was too
             busy down at O'Grady's throwing up on
             his own. In fact, until I was sixteen,
             I thought throwing up was a sign of
             maturity. While the other kids were
             off in the woods sneaking cigarettes, I
             was hiding behind the house with my
             fingers down my throat. (laughter)
             I never got anywhere until one day,
             my father caught me. Just as he was
             giving me a final kick in the stomach,
             for luck, I managed to heave all
             over his new shoes. "That's it,"
             I thought. "I've made it. I'm
             finally a man!" (laughter) As it
             turned out, that was the only time my
             father ever paid any real attention
             to me. He was usually too busy out
             in the park playing ball with my
             sister, Rose. And, today thanks to
             those many hours of practice, my
             sister Rose has grown into a fine man.
             (laughter) Me, I wasn't especially
             interested in athletics. The only
             exercise I ever got was when the
             other kids picked on me. They used
             to beat me up once a week, usually
             Tuesday. After a while, the school
             worked it into the curriculum. And,
             if you knocked me out, you got extra
             credit. (laughter) Except there was
             this one kid who was afraid of me. I
             kept telling him, "Hit me! Hit me!
             What's the matter with you? Don't you
             want graduate?" As for me, I was
             the only kid in the history of the
             school to graduate in traction. The
             school nurse tucked my diploma into
             my sling. But my only real interest,
             right from the beginning, was show
             business. Even as a young man, I
             began at the very top, collecting
             autographs. (laughter)CUT TO:134   INT:   MARSHA'S APARTMENT - NIGHTDinner is over. MARSHA is sitting next to LANGFORD. As

      goes off stage after soaking up the applause.CUT TO:136   INT:   THE WINGS - NIGHTA group of PLAINCLOTHESMEN seize PUPKIN and march him
      briskly through the backstage corridor towards the
      backstage door.CUT TO:137   EXT:   THE BACKSTAGE DOOR - NIGHTA handful of PEOPLE are waiting, among them the autograph
      hunters, MAE, CELESTE and SIDNEY. MAE, out of a reflex of
      thirty years, immediately extends her autograph book
      towards PUPKIN, then, recognizing him, immediately pulls
      it back.MAE(to PUPKIN)
             Who did you get?

      PUPKIN says nothing as he is hustled into a limousine.
      SIDNEY and CELESTE look on. MAE trails after PUPKIN and
      the PLAINCLOTHESMEN.MAE(to PLAINCLOTHESMAN)
             Could I have a ride?

      The PLAINCLOTHESMAN says nothing and starts getting in the
      limo.MAEI've never been in one.

      The limo pulls away.CUT TO:138   INT:   INSPECTOR PATTEN'S DOWNTOWN OFFICE - NIGHTPUPKIN stands among a crowd of PLAINCLOTHESMEN who have
      obviously been working him over. PATTEN sits behind his
      desk. GIARDELLO is at his side. The clock on the wall
      reads 10:20.PATTENOkay, Pupkin. We'll start all over
             again. Where is Langford? You know,
             we're going to find him sooner or later.PUPKINI'm trying to tell    you, Inspector.
             You let me walk out    of here, right?
             And as soon as I'm    seen my act on
             the show -- as soon    as I'm sure they've
             really put it on --    I'll tell you where
             Jerry is and you'll    get him back safe
             and sound.PATTENFine, Pupkin. Then why don't you watch
             the show here with us? That way we're
             all happy. (to GIARDELLO) What channel?GIARDELLOSeven.PATTENWe get that one in fine.    So what do
             you say, Pupkin?PUPKINLook, I'll say it again.    You let
             me go now.

      PATTEN motions to the PLAINCLOTHESMEN wearily with his
      head. They drag PUPKIN off. PATTEN looks up at the clock.CUT TO:139   INT:   MARSHA'S APARTMENT - NIGHTMARSHA is frantically attempting to unwrap LANGFORD. With
      each pull of the tape, LANGFORD yelps. There is a small
      tangle of unwrapped tape collecting around LANGFORD's feet
      and sticking to MARSHA's clothes.LANGFORDWatch my hair!MARSHAI'm sorry, baby.

      We hear the sound of tape ripping.LANGFORDOw!MARSHAI'm sorry.CUT TO:140   INT:   PATTEN'S OFFICE - NIGHTPUPKIN is hustled before PATTEN again.A PLAINCLOTHESMANStill nothing.

      PUPKIN glances at the clock.      It is 11:05.PUPKINI've got to get out of here.PATTENYou're not going anywhere, Pupkin.
             Now, where is he?PUPKINI'm telling you, Inspector,    if I don't
             see that showwhereI    want to see it,
             Jerry Langford is dead. My     people
             have instructions to execute    him
             unless they hear from me by    midnight.PATTEN glances apprehensively at GIARDELLO.PATTENJust where is it you want to watch
             this show?CUT TO:141   INT:   MARSHA'S APARTMENT - NIGHTLANGFORD is half unwrapped now. The place is covered with
      yard after yard of tape.   MARSHA is working frantically to
      finish unwrapping LANGFORD who is helping now that his arms
      are free.LANGFORDOw!   God damnit! Not so fast!MARSHA(working frantically)
             We haven't all night, baby.

      MARSHA rips the tape off LANGFORD.LANGFORDOW!!!!MARSHAOh, I love you, baby.   I love you
             so much.CUT TO:142   EXT:   BROADWAY - NIGHTA limo drives down Broadway, followed by an unmarked car.CUT TO:143   INT:   THE LIMO - NIGHTPATTEN and GIARDELLO sit up front, with the DRIVER. PUPKIN
      sits in the back between two PLAINCLOTHESMEN. The limo
      pulls up in front of the bar-restaurant where RITA works.
      PATTEN turns around in the front seat to address PUPKIN.PATTENHere we, are, Pupkin. I don't know
             what this is all about, but as soon
             as you've seen yourself, you're going
             to talk to us or I promise you,
             you'll never see daylight again.PUPKINI'll need a couple of minutes, Inspector.PATTENWhat?!?PUPKINAfter it's over, I want a couple of
     minutes. And I'll need ten dollars.
     Does anyone of you gentlemen have my
     wallet?PATTENDon't push me, Pupkin.PUPKINA condemned man's last request,
     Inspector.PATTENWell, I'll tell you right away, the
     answer is no, Pupkin.PUPKINIt's not much of a ransom, Inspector ...PATTEN(losing his temper)
     Look, I'm drawing the line, that's
     all! No ten dollars and that's it.
     (emphatically) No -- ten -- dollars!!!!
     You understand?!?PUPKIN(in mollifying tones)
     Sure. Sure, Inspector. No ten dollars ...PATTEN(appeased)
     Okay.PUPKIN... and no Jerry Langford.

There is a pause as PATTEN stifles himself.PUPKINCome on, it's getting late, Inspector.PATTEN(exploding to     one of his MEN)
     Go ahead. Give him      his goddamned ten
     dollars! Give him      twenty! I don't
     care. Just get him      out of here!

One of the PLAINCLOTHESMEN in the back opens the door and
PUPKIN and the other PLAINCLOTHESMAN get out. The unmarked
car has pulled up behind the limo and other PLAINCLOTHESMEN
stand next to it. PUPKIN and the two PLAINCLOTHESMEN start
walking the ten yards or so to the bar-restaurant.CUT TO:144   INT:   THE BAR-RESTAURANT - NIGHTPUPKIN marches in flanked by the PLAINCLOTHESMEN. The
      clock over the bar reads 11:30. RITA looks up from talking
      with a CUSTOMER and sees PUPKIN. She says nothing. She
      just looks at him. There are five CUSTOMERS at the bar. A
      working class COUPLE in their late fifties are half-stewed,
      the man telling the woman that her friend, Maud, isn't
      really her friend because she wants $150 for a used
      refrigerator. A few seats down, two MEN in their mid-
      forties, in wind-breakers are locked in an intense but
      inaudible conversation. And, close to the television set
      which hangs over the far end of the bar sits a MOUSY MAN
      with glasses, who looks like an accountant. He is sipping
      a beer, his eyes fixed on the set where the CBS late movie
      is just showing its logo. PUPKIN marches up to the bar.PUPKIN(urgently to RITA)
             Turn on Langford. Seven.MOUSY MANHey!   I'm watchingthis.

      RITA keeps staring at PUPKIN.PUPKINJust turn it. Come on.MOUSY MANI was here first, mister. You can't
             just walk in like this. It isn't
             fair.

      RITA glances at the MAN. PUPKIN can't      wait. He vaults
      onto the bar and turns the set to the     Langford Show, just
      as, on screen, he walks from the wings     onto the stage to
      the applause of the studio audience.      Perched atop the bar,
      standing next to the image of himself,     PUPKIN looks down at
      RITA, a smile of pride and triumph on     his face.CUT TO:145   MONTAGE -- NIGHTPUPKIN walking onto television screens in various homes
      across America -- in a chic New York living room, in a
      suburban bedroom, in the parlor of an Indiana farmhouse,
      in a kitchen where a COUPLE is in the middle of a raging
      domestic quarrel, in an otherwise dark bedroom where a
      COUPLE is in the throes of lovemaking, in a bar, a station
      house, in a television store window display.CUT TO:146   INT:   MARSHA'S APARTMENT -- NIGHTMARSHA has just removed her dress and stands in      her bra and
      panties as LANGFORD unwraps the last tape from      about his
      ankles. The room is swimming in tape, like an       enormous
      boa constrictor gone mad. MARSHA moves towards       LANGFORD,
      her arms open.MARSHAOh, baby.   Baby.

      LANGFORD frees his ankles of tape just in time to side-step
      MARSHA and moves quickly to the dining room table where he
      grabs the gun. He trains it on her.LANGFORDStop!

      MARSHA moves toward him. He pulls the trigger, releasing
      a plastic pellet that hits MARSHA in the stomach, stinging her.MARSHAOw!

      LANGFORD glances down in horror at the gun which he now
      realizes is a toy and looks up in horror to see MARSHA,
      bigger than life, bearing down on him.MARSHADon't be afraid of Marsha, baby.CUT TO:147   INT:   BAR-RESTAURANT - NIGHTThe CUSTOMERS are watching the conclusion of Pupkin's
      monologue, along with the PLAINCLOTHESMEN and PUPKIN. WE
      COME IN a split second after a joke. The CUSTOMERS laugh,
      with the exception of the MOUSY MAN who is waiting, in bad
      humor, for Pupkin's act to finish. The PLAINCLOTHESMEN
      laugh reluctantly. PUPKIN, no longer standing on the bar,
      but back down with the others, watches with fascination.
      RITA watches grimly, occasionally glancing at PUPKIN.

                         PUPKIN on TV
             But I figured it this way: better to
             be King for a Night than Schmuck for
             a Lifetime. (audience and CUSTOMERS
             laugh)   Good night, ladies and
             gentlemen, and God bless you.

      The television audience applauds and the CUSTOMERS applaud
      and cheer in good humor except for the MOUSY MAN. The
      HALF-STEWED MAN leans across his WOMAN to yell at PUPKIN
      as the two FRIENDS in windbreakers congratulate PUPKIN at
      the same time. There is a brief moment of carnival
      excitement.HALF-STEWED MAN                FIRST FRIENDHey, that's pretty good.             (to PUPKIN)Schmuck for a Lifetime!      How do you think up all
(to the WOMAN) You know      that stuff?
who he's talkin' about?
Your brother!SECOND FRIENDHALF-STEWED WOMAN       It's a trick, that's
What aboutyourall. Larry can do it
brother?                as good as him.HALF-STEWED MAN        MOUSY MANWhat about him?              Is it over now?HALF-STEWED WOMAN             FIRST FRIENDHe's another one.       He's funnier than Larry.
                        Larry just makes a lot
      HALF-STEWED MAN of faces.
(getting a little angry)
I told you to shut up about         MOUSY MAN
my brother. (to PUPKIN)       Well, if nobody
She doesn't know nuthin'.     minds ...

PUPKIN takes all this praise and excitement with a shy
smile of satisfaction, glancing at RITA from time to time
for her reaction. She merely stares at PUPKIN with a sad
expression on her face.PUPKINCome on, Rita. Don't spoil the party.
     (to the CUSTOMERS) Drinks all around
     on me.HALF-STEWED MAN(in a loud voice, to HALF-STEWED WOMAN)What about the hundred and fifty?
     We never saw a penny outtayourbrother.HALF-STEWED WOMANThat's because my brother is afamilyman, not like Phil.

The argument between the HALF-STEWED MAN and his WOMAN
continues at the end of the bar. The two FRIENDS have
resumed their intense conversation.PUPKIN(to the two FRIENDS)
     What'll you have?FIRST FRIENDI'm okay.   Thanks, pal.SECOND FRIENDMe, too.

The MOUSY MAN has climbed up on the bar and has turned the
TV back to the late movie. He sits enthralled by a sceneof violence courtesy of Tony Curtis as the Boston
Strangler. PUPKIN looks down the bar at the STEWED COUPLE
to offer them drinks, but they are lost in an argument
over the relative merits of their brothers. PUPKIN turns
to the PLAINCLOTHESMEN.PUPKINI don't suppose you're allowed anything.
     (to RITA) I guess nobody's in a
     celebrating mood. How about you?
     You want something?FIRST PLAINCLOTHESMANIt's getting time, Pupkin.PUPKINIn a second.RITA(in a sad, serious voice
           to PUPKIN)
     That was true, wasn't it? ... about
     the kidnapping.

PUPKIN nods and shrugs.PUPKINNow you can say you knew me.   That's
     something, anyway.FIRST PLAINCLOTHESMANCome on, Pupkin.PUPKIN(to RITA, in a quiet,
           tender voice)
     I guess I've got go. Take care of
     yourself, will you. And when you're
     bored -- you know, when you're brushing
     your teeth or something, give me a
     thought, okay?RITAOkay.

The PLAINCLOTHESMEN lead PUPKIN out of the bar. The two
FRIENDS are still buried in their intense, private
conversation. The PLAINCLOTHESMEN and PUPKIN walk past
the HALF-STEWED COUPLE.HALF-STEWED WOMANIt's okay to talk about my sister,
     but we can't say nuthin' about Phil,
     is that it?HALF-STEWED MAN(to PUPKIN)
     She's just had one too many.The PLAINCLOTHESMEN lead PUPKIN onto the street.148   EXT:   THE BAR - NIGHTAs they walk the few steps to the car, the FIRST
      PLAINCLOTHESMAN turns to PUPKIN.FIRST    PLAINCLOTHESMANI just don't get    it, Pupkin. You're
             gonna spend eight    years in the can --
             "minimum" -- and    for what?SECOND PLAINCLOTHESMANYeah, Pupkin. You threw it all away.PUPKIN(vaguely)
             We'll see.

      WE CLOSE IN on PUPKIN, smiling.FADE TO:149   INT:   THE JERRY LANGFORD SHOW STUDIO - NIGHTThe STAGE MANAGER is counting down. At zero, he points to
      RICK ROSS who launches the orchestra into the Langford Show
      theme song. BERT CANTER, standing stage right, speaks into

             of Comedy!!!!

      The AUDIENCE applauds mightily and the FINAL CREDITS roll.
      As they roll, the music to the Langford Show continues and
      WE WATCH a MONTAGE that shows PUPKIN progressively taping
      LANGFORD to the back of a brass bedstead on stage as the
      two of them talk and laugh. By the end of the MONTAGE,
      LANGFORD is once again mummified and PUPKIN, having
      finished, bows and smiles. WE CLOSE on a FREEZE-FRAME
