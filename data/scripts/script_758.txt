MAX PAYNEWritten byBeau Michael Thorne8/24/2007OVER BLACK:MAX'S VOICECI don't believe in heaven, but I have
                      this idea about it. Something I heard in
                      a song.FADE IN:White.pristine, empty frame.   Clean and peaceful.MAX'S VOICEHeaven is a place where nothing ever
                      happens.There's gentle motion in the blank frame, like swirling 16mm
          grain. A RUMBLE starts to build, low but growing louder...The grain moves faster, big chunks fluttering, now a dirty
          dishwater grey. The RUMBLE becoming a HOWLING WIND.Churning black water LAPS at the bottom of the frame...EXT. HUDSON RIVER - DAWNA blizzard, at the peak of its power. Visibility zero, New
          York reduced to the hulking shapes of buildings on the banks.
          MAX PAYNE thrashes in the water, a long way from shore.MAX'S VOICEThere's an army of bodies under this
                      river. Criminals, people who ran out of
                      time, out of friends.Chunks of ice float in the dirty water around him. Max's
          body freezing, skin turning blue. Heavy winter clothes
          saturating, like an anchor dragging him down...MAX'S VOICEThe next time they drag this river,
                      they'll find me on the bottom with the
                      rest of them. And there won't be anybody
                      left to say I was different.Max's face sinks below the surface...CUT TO:INT. HALLWAY - DAYNothing to orient us to the location, the time. Just a flash
          of golden light filling the hall, warm as the river was cold.
          Around a closed door, sunlight streams through the gaps...BEDROOMA WOMAN sleeps on the bed, curled up around a bundled BABY.
          Is this the final, peaceful memory of a drowning man?Something's wrong, then: the woman's body in an unnatural
          position, more thrown than laid across the bed. The crib
          tipped over, blankets scattered. Her eyes frozen open.Something BLACK flutters against the window pane, CRACKING
          into the glass. The sound of the BLIZZARD creeps in...RESUME - HUDSON RIVERWind POUNDS the river where Max had once been, but there's no
          more thrashing in the water. Mixed in behind the falling
          snowflakes, BLACK SHAPES swirl and dive closer to the water.MAX'S VOICEI could feel the dead down there, just
                    below my feet. Reaching up to welcome me
                    as one of their own.Max breaks the surface - GASPING, STRUGGLING against the
          undertow. Not simply trying to breathe...trying to swim.MAX'S VOICEIt was an easy mistake to make.CUT TO:EXT. STREET (NYC) - NIGHTAbruptly, the snow is gone. Just a bitter wind left in its
          place, whipping through desolate streets long after midnight.
          Shuffling up the littered sidewalk, three rough-looking MEN
          duck out of the wind by descending down to the subway...On the dark side of the street, a pair of BOOTS follows them.TITLE CARD:      ONE WEEK EARLIERINT. ROSCOE ST. STATION - DAYA filthy platform, empty except for the three Men huddled on
          a bench. A squeaking TURNSTILE catches their ear...The same boots grind towards the Men. We don't see the
          walker's face, distracted by something else: a gleaming gold
          wristwatch. As if to make certain the Men notice, he pulls
          back his sleeve to check the time. Quarter past three...The watch glints as it passes into a dark doorway marked
          `MEN'S.' The Men follow, exchanging wicked grins. Too easy.SUBWAY BATHROOMThe Men slink into the bathroom, smirking at their oblivious
          prey at the sink. Steam rising, he sets the watch on the
          edge of the sink before washing his hands...MAN #1Hey, that's a really nice watch.No answer. One of the Men LOCKS the door.       At the sound of
          the lock SNAPPING, he raises his head...Max Payne, but not yet the man struggling for life in the
          river: clean-shaven, skin like bleached bone. Haunted eyes.
          In the murky mirror, Max sees the Men circling closer...MAN #1(drooling over the watch)
                       Kinda reminds me of one I lost--MAXYou didn't lose it. You pawned it up on
                       128th a few hours ago.Max shuts off the water and calmly turns to face them.MAX(nodding to Man #2)
                       Ask Doug. He was there with you.Doug frowns, deeply confused about being called by his name.DOUGYou've been following us all night?MAXNo.
                            (pointing)
                       I'm only following you.While Doug digests that, PAWNSHOP pulls a pistol and trains
          it on Max's forehead. The third man - not much more than a
          KID, visibly frightened - backs towards the door.4.PAWNSHOPYou a cop, or something?MAXNot tonight.PAWNSHOPToo bad.
                           (to Doug)
                       Go get my watch.Distractedly eyeballing Max, Doug brushes the watch off of
          the sink. It hits the dirty tile, delicate crystal CRACKING.In a sudden blur of movement, Max has one hand on the pistol,
          the other one SMASHING into Pawnshop's windpipe...Doug steps forward to help... BOOM! The pistol goes off as
          Max pries it free. Max looks up at Doug. Nowhere to run, he
          races into the farthest stall and SLAMS the door.In the same instant, the Kid bolts for the door. Max has to
          pick: follow or stay with the man he's tracking...In the stall, Doug crawls on his stomach across the sticky
          floor, trying to squeeze under the divider. Max raises the
          pistol and BLASTS a hole through the door of the next stall.DOUG(craving, eyes closed)
                       Watch over me, watch over me...The newly-perforated door flies open. Handcuffs SNAP,
          restraining a WHIMPERING Doug to the toilet pipe.MAXOpen your eyes, now.Doug finds himself staring at the pistol's front sight. Max
          reaches into his pocket and produces a tattered photograph...
          It's the woman from Max's golden vision in the river.MAXHave you ever seen her before?Doug shakes his head violently, confusion and terror rising.MAXYou got busted robbing a house in New
                       Jersey with William Preston three--DOUGBill's dead.MAXThat's why I'm talking to you.
                         (moving the photo closer)
                     Did he ever say anything about this
                     woman? Did you ever hear anyone--DOUGBill died because their wings couldn't
                     lift him up.MAXNo, he got shot robbing a liquor store.
                     What are you talking about?DOUG(incoherent, rambling)
                     Their wings are golden, the feathers only
                     look black...Sighing, Max unlocks Doug from the pipe, hauling him up and
          slamming into the wall as he cuffs his hands behind his back.PLATFORMMax stalks out of the bathroom, pushing Doug ahead of him.
          Down on the tracks, the Kid shrinks into the shadows...SUBWAY TUNNELThe Kid runs down the dark tracks, nervously glancing back at
          the receding light of the platform.   He slows gradually,
          relaxing as escape seems certain.Down to a walk, he startles at movement in the tunnel ahead:
          FLAPPING WINGS - a bird, lost and trapped underground?The Kid freezes, his frightened BREATHS almost enough to
          drown the sound out. It grows, though, more WINGS joining...He turns to retreat up the tracks, but the WINGS suddenly
          seem to be echoing towards him from all directions.Panicked, the Kid becomes disoriented in the growing RACKET,
          the tunnel ahead begins to glow brighter as he spins...Visible now in the growing light, BLACK SHAPES flicker above
          the tracks - dozens becoming hundreds, swelling larger, their
          POUNDING wings joined by a train RUMBLING closer...6.Frozen, the Kid can only squint into the headlights closing
          in, petrified by the dark wings SWIRLING around him...INT. COLD CASE OFFICE - DAYThe front room of the cold case department is a mess - desks
          piled high with paperwork and a week's worth of coffee cups.Halfway in the front door, a young DETECTIVE stands holding a
          box of his belongings. He looks around for signs of life.
          SERGEANT ADAMS wanders down the hall, frowning at the draft.SGT. ADAMSYou my new guy?DETECTIVEI didn't think anybody was here.SGT. ADAMSEverybody's usually a little late.HALLWAYSgt. Adams leads the detective down a hall, giving the tour.SGT. ADAMSAll the cold investigations in the city

                       add anything to their original statement.DETECTIVEAnd if they can?SGT. ADAMSWe send the file back to the original
                       precinct for follow-up. Don't get your
                       hopes up, though.The Sergeant continues towards the center of the building,
          farther from the light of the windows. He stops at a door.SGT. ADAMSOnce you've gone through the file and
                       come up empty, bring it here...FILE ROOM/MAX'S OFFICEThey enter a windowless cave, long rows of metal cabinets
          stretching on forever into the heart of the building. At a
          desk in the corner, Max slumps over a stack of files.DM7.SGT. ADAMSMax here handles our filing. Once it
                       hits his desk, a case is officially dead.ax looks up, dark circles from his long night in the subway.
          He nods, but the Detective is too busy making a note to see.DETECTIVEWhat if there's no phone number for a
                       witness? Should I follow up in person?SGT. ADAMSNope, we don't do that down here.iscretely, Max slides his cut-up knuckles under the desk...DETECTIVEI don't understand, then how--SGT. ADAMSHow do you solve that unsolvable murder
                       mystery and redeem yourself?DETECTIVEThe grand jury couldn't find--SGT. ADAMSStop. Trust me, there's a tragic story
                       behind why I'm here giving you this tour.
                       We all did something, so just save it.
                           (moving for the door)
                       Follow me to the break room...The Detective turns to Max, embarrassed after his reprimand.DETECTIVEWe should get a beer after work, or
                       something...Max smiles and nods, but his eyes give him away as a liar:MAXYeah.   Maybe so.HALLWAYThe Detective steals a look at Max as Adams shuts his door.DETECTIVESo what did he do?WMJ8.SGT. ADAMS(sharply)
                       Nothing.Naturally, this reaction piques the detective's curiosity.SGT. ADAMSRemember when you were a kid, and you'd
                       hold your breath when you went past a
                       graveyard?The detective nods.     Adams glances through the window at Max.SGT. ADAMSust...try to leave him alone.MAX'S OFFICEMax sneaks a sideways glance to the door, watching Adams lead
          the new Detective away. Once they're gone, Max reaches into
          his desk and removes a file... `PRESTON, WILLIAM A.'ax goes to a rusted cabinet and buries the file deep inside.INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - NIGHTA lock POPS.     Max steps inside, only silence to greet him.Max lays his jacket across the back of a worn leather chair,
          footsteps REVERBERATING because there's little other
          furniture to absorb the sound. He keeps walking...KITCHEN...past a table with one chair, past gleaming counters. Max
          fills a glass of water from the tap. Eyes blank, patient.LIVING ROOMCarefully, Max rests the full glass on the arm of the chair.
          Reaching underneath the chair, Max produces an artist's
          sketchbook and places it delicately on the table before him.Sith trembling hands, Max turns back the battered cover...
           uddenly, colors burst into the monochrome room: bright
          swirls of oil pastels sketch out a still life in Technicolor.Gradually, Max's eyes lose their hardness. His breaths come
          FASTER, ragged. Jaw clenched, he turns the page...VI9.More flowing brush strokes, the artist's feminine initials...
          Max reaches up to turn the page, hands shaking severely...He takes hold of the corner of the page, but his muscles
          won't cooperate - as if the page ways more than Max can lift.Max's skin flushes red...tears almost welling...And then at once, Max slams the book shut and turns away.CLOSETThe door swings open. Hanging inside, the battered coat we
          saw Max wear in the subway. A pistol on a hook by the door.
          Urban armor, scarred by countless nights of service.Max dresses himself for battle, eyes returning to stone.EXT. STREET - NIGHTMax climbs out of the subway into a neighborhood with a foot
          in two worlds: the buildings are old and crumbling, but the
          shops inside are sleek and expensive. A jarring combination.Max walks up the street, brushing past HOMELESS PEOPLE and
          FASHIONISTAS jostling for the same space on the sidewalk.NT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAYThe hallway is ancient brick, but the doors are pristine
          steel. Pausing at one with a dozen locks, Max KNOCKS.The door cracks.    An EYE appears.   Squinting, evaluating.OICE (O.S.)You can't come here anymore.MAXWilliam Preston was a dead end.The door cracks enough to reveal the speaker: TREVOR, skinny-

          a cutting-edge loft beyond, filled with modern art and a
          gathering of BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE milling around enjoying it.TREVORI thought you found Bill's partner.MAXI did, but Doug only wanted to talk about
                    pigeons, or something. I need a new
                    name, someone robbing houses to feed a

                    Either way, I'm not the one to ask

          beautiful, returns his gaze for an extra moment and smiles.MAXI can see that.TREVORThis is a party. These are my friends.

          his utilitarian clothes. She looks up as he gets closer...NATASHAou decided to stay for a while.She speaks with a Russian accent - smiling, a little nervous.
          Rather than answering, Max's eyes drop to her wrist.NATASHAow it's your turn to say something...ax takes her hand, gently turning it to reveal her tattoo: a
          black wing, stylized feathers tracing faint blue veins.MAXThat's interesting.NATASHAThank you. It's...

          nervously greeting another new arrival: MONA SAX. She's
          striking, beautiful but also a little frightening. It
          doesn't hurt that she's flanked by BODYGUARDS. Russian Mob.Seeing Natasha standing with Max, Mona barrels across the
          room towards them. People stand aside to let her pass.ithout preamble, Mona begins YELLING at Natasha in Russian.
          Natasha RESPONDS in kind, clearly intimidated by Mona.Abruptly, Mona grabs Natasha's arm, jerking her off balance.MAXWhy don't you let go--S12.MONA(in perfect English)

          Natasha's tone becomes PLEADING, physically no match for
          Mona. Max steps in, reaching up to touch Mona's shoulder...It happens in a flash: Mona spins and takes hold of Max's
          arm. Incredibly, he's just as fast, slipping free of the
          grip that would surely have snapped his wrist...For a moment, Max and Mona stare each other down. Surprised,
          reevaluating each other. Natasha continues to TALK, her
          Russian anxious as Mona's bodyguards push through the crowd.Mona's eyes drop to Max's chest, where the tussle pulled his
          coat open to reveal a low-pro holster and tarnished badge.With the flick of her wrist, Mona stops her guards' advance.The crowd begins to notice the altercation. Natasha keeps
          TALKING, trying desperately to make peace and reassure Mona
          of something. Mona's eyes cut between Natasha and Max...till apprehensive, Mona shakes her head and walks away.NATASHAMy sister.

                       Sort of a bitch.As Max nods at the understatement, Trevor rushes over,
          forcing a broad smile to reassure his guests. He pulls Max's
          coat closed over the badge and ushers him towards the door.TREVORYou have to go. Now.MAX(pulling free)

          Cast on the walls, corresponding shadows twist and shift...A black feather billows across the floor between candles.
          Spreading up the wall, a new shadow rises above the rest...pair of wings - long and distorted in the candle light.Max appears in the doorway as the shadows loose their shape -

          Natasha pounces - kissing, hands running over his body. As

          Still walking, opening her shirt on her way out of the room.HALLWAYMax moves down the hallway, following a trail of clothing.
          From inside a room, we hear the faint sound of CHANTING...BEDROOMIn Max's bed, a thin sheet barely covers Natasha's body. Her
          lips tremble with a slurred SONG. With predatory eyes, she
          watches Max stop in the doorway, something holding him back.NATASHA(frustrated sigh)
