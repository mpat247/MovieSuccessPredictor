          against a large window which looks out over the city, an
          elegant woman in her 70's: EVELYN GREENSLADE. She's on the
          phone, on hold.
          On the desk in front of her is a brand new laptop computer;
          the screen reads 'Getting Started ...'AUTOMATED VOICE(ON PHONE)Thank you for your patience.
          Your call is important to us. We
          will be with you shortly.
          Evelyn's patience is strained nonetheless. She taps her
          fingers on the desk.
          AUTOMATED VOICE (cont'd)(ON PHONE)Thank you for your patience.
          Your call is -
          A slightly-accented voice finally interrupts.FEMALE VOICEMrs Greenslade, thank you forWAITING -EVELYN(OVERLAPPING)Yes, now if you could stay on the
          phone for a moment and talk to
          me, just talk to me. I'm not
          even clear, I don't actually
          understand what it is I'm trying
          to order. Is wireless the same
          as wi-fi? And what do either of
          them have to do with broadband?FEMALE VOICEMrs Greenslade, since the account
          is not in your name, before we
          can make any changes we need to
          speak to the account holder. Can
          I please talk to the account
          holder?EVELYNWhat?FEMALE VOICEI'm asking if I can speak to the
          account holder. Before we can
          make any changes -EVELYNYou can't talk to him, no.(BEAT)He's dead. He died. There's
          only me.3 INT. CORRIDOR/JUDGES CHAMBERS. INNS OF COURT - NIGHT 3GILES, a judge in full wig and robes, moves quickly down a
          corridor. He passes other judges, going the opposite way.
          He arrives at the office of GRAHAM DASHWOOD, goes in.
          GRAHAM is at his desk. His robes are on a hanger, his wig
          is on a stand beside him.GILESWe're late.4 INT. CORRIDOR. INNS OF COURT - NIGHT 4Moments later. Graham and Giles walk down the corridor.GRAHAMBloody retirement parties. Hard
          cheese, soft wine, and endless
          speeches. Why do people do that?
          No one ever said about any kind
          of party: it was a wonderful
          occasion, just a shame that the
          speeches were so short.GILESit'll be you one day.GRAHAMOne day very soon.GILESYou've been saying that for
          years.
          They walk into a large room, full of lawyers.4A INT. HALL. INNS OF COURT - CONTINUOUS 4AAt one end of the hall, a very old JUDGE is giving a very
          dull speech.3.JUDGEAn occasion such as this leads
          one to cast ones mind back to the
          days when I first entered my
          pupillage. I had the very good
          fortune of serving as a junior to
          Mr Justice Stancombe
          Graham's not listening any more. He's looking around the
          room. At the old, tired faces.JUDGE (CONT'D). the unwelcome news that I
          would transfer Chambers, bringing
          to mind the old adage a fronte
          praecipitium, a tergo 1upi
          Everything seems to slow down, the judge's mouth moving
          more and more sluggishly, though his voice remains the
          same. The effect is strange .. then the sound of laughter.GRAHAMThis is the day.
          Everyone looks round at him. He's almost as surprised as
          they are that he's spoken out loud.GILESGraham?GRAHAMThis is the day.
          He turns and walks out.5 INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 5Staff bustle around a busy A & E ward. MURIEL lies on a
          bed in the corridor.
          The Head Nurse, KAREN, rushes past.MURIELListen, young lady. I want a cup
          of tea, and I want it now.KARENThe trolley will be along
          shortly.MURIELHow hard d'you have to fall down
          before you get some proper
          attention? Hours I've been lying
          here, and not a single doctor has
          come to see me.3A.KARENNow that's not quite true, is it
          Mrs Donnelly?(MORE)4.KAREN (CONT'D)A doctor did try and examine you,
          and you sent him away.MURIELThat one?
          She looks up to the far end of the ward, where a doctor is
          washing his hands. He's black.MURIELHe can wash all he likes, that
          colour's not coming out. I want
          an English doctor.KARENAn English doctor? Why didn't
          you say so? I'll get one right
          away.
          She goes away, comes back moments later with a tall,
          handsome doctor. The bad news for Muriel isKAREN (CONT'D)This is Dr Ghujarapartidar. And
          this is Mrs Donnelly.5A EXT. NEW HOUSING ESTATE - DAY 5AA crescent of identical bungalows, part of a brand new
          retirement facility.
          A mobility scooter carrying an elderly resident trundles
          down the road.ESTATE AGENT (O.S.).. with an unlimited range of
          leisure opportunities just a
          stone's throw away...6 INT. NEW HOUSING DEVELOPMENT - DAY 6A young estate agent, EVAN, is showing DOUGLAS and JEAN
          around a very small, and very beige bungalow.EVANSo as I say, what you're looking
          at here is very competitively
          priced, you can't get better
          value for your grey pound.
          Another little feature, not
          necessary right now, but give it
          a couple of years(POINTS). rails on the walls to help
          you get around, and down here, a
          panic button in case of a sudden
          fall, brings the Warden running.4A.JEANWhat if we fell somewhere else?EVANSorry?JEANIt's just that we might not
          manage to plan our sudden fall in
          the exact corner where the button
          is.EVANYeah. As I say -5.JEANAnd would it be possible to get
          the rail to go through the middle
          of the room as well?DOUGLASDARLINGJEANTo help us get across, not just
          around?DOUGLAS(TO EVAN)Could we have a moment, please?
          Thanks. Thanks so much.
          Evan goes.JEANThirty years in the Civil Service
          and this is all we can afford?DOUGLASWould it help if I apologized
          again?JEANNo. But try it anyway.7 INT. BAR - NIGHT 7JUDITH (40ish) is sitting opposite someone. We don't see
           whom.JUDITHAnd then after that I worked as a
          systems analyst for a few years
          but I just found it so dull, what
          I really wanted was to do
          something that was more creative,
          that matched my ...(BEAT)I'm sorry. On the form they
          asked for our age bracket, and
          the age we wanted to meet . and
          in both cases I ticked 35-45.
          Now we see the man she's talking to. It's NORMAN. He's
          dapper, nice looking. And at least 70.NORMANThat's right, yes. So did I.
          They're at a speed dating evening. Numbered tables, etc.NORMAN (CONT'D)Anyway, don't stop. SomethingMORE CREATIVE6.JUDITHHow old are you?NORMANEarly 40's.JUDITHD'you mean you were born in the
          early 40's?NORMANJudy, I know what you're asking -JUDITHIt's Judith.NORMANJudith. And trust me, I've still
          got it.
          The bell goes; the signal for the women to get up and move
          along to the next table. Judith leaves without looking
          back.NORMAN (CONT'D)I just can't find anyone that
          wants it.
          Another hopeful candidate arrives opposite Norman. And
          looks crestfallen at what's on offer.8 INT/EXT. BEDROOM/STAIRS/HALL. FAMILY HOUSE - DAY 8MADGE is in her bedroom. She's arguing with her son-in-law
          CRAIG. Madge's suitcases are by the door.CRAIGThis is crazy. You're crazy.
          You can't just up and leave like
          this.MADGEAnd yet if you watch me, that's
          exactly what you'll see happen.
          She picks up her suitcases, heads out of the room. Madge's
          daughter JESSICA is on the landing.JESSICAWhat's going on?CRAIGYour mother's lost it.JESSICAMy mother never had it.7.CRAIGTalk to her. She doesn't listen
          to me.MADGENobody listens to you.
          She heads down the stairs. Craig and Jessica follow.MADGE (CONT'D)(TO JESSICA)It's one of the great mysteries
          of life that someone so vibrant
          and fascinating as my daughter
          should choose to spend her life
          with this fraction of a man.JESSICAI still don't understand what's
          going on.CRAIGI just asked her to babysit. And
          now she says she's leaving.
          They're at the bottom of the stairs. Jessica's children,
          LIAM and KATIE, are watching.JESSICABut you love babysitting.MADGEI loved it last night.LIAMWe had pizza and stayed up late.MADGEAnd the night before.KATIEWe had Chinese and stayed up
          late.LIAMIf you don't go, tonight we could
          do a curry.MADGEIt's tempting, my darlings, but
          you know why I must leave.LIAMWe know.KATIE(to her parents)
          Being here is stopping her
          finding a husband.8.CRAIGAnother one?LIAM AND KATIEBye Granny.MADGEDon't let the buggers get you
          down.
          Madge turns to go.CRAIGHow many husbands have you had,
          anyway?
          She turns back, smiles.MADGEIncluding my own?
          Then she's out of the front door, and heading for the taxi.JESSICAMother? Mother!9 INT/EXT. TAXI - DAY 9Moments later. Madge climbs into the back of the cab.TAXI DRIVERName the place, darling. Where
          are you going?
          Madge smiles.MADGEI have absolutely no idea.10 INT. MANSION FLAT - DAY 10Evelyn, whom we saw earlier on the phone, is in the living
          room. Her son CHRISTOPHER is there. And her lawyerHAROLD.CHRISTOPHERThere's no other way There
          just isn't. Harold told us this 
          three months ago.HAROLDAnd I'm afraid matters have only
          got worse.8A.CHRISTOPHERWe can't wait any longer. We
          need to put this flat on the
          market, and at least make a start
          at paying off Dad's debts.9.Christopher turns to Harold.CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D)I've talked it through with Polly
          and the boys, and of course we 
          all agreed. Ma will move in with 
          us.HAROLDI think that's best, Evelyn.
          It's what Hugh would've wanted.
          They wait for confirmation from Evelyn. None comes.CHRISTOPHERGood. Settled. End of
          discussion.EVELYNThat's what your father used to
          say.CHRISTOPHERMA -EVELYNWhen there'd never really been 
          any discussion at all.CHRISTOPHERI want to look after things for 
          you.EVELYNLike he did for forty yearsCHRISTOPHERYes.EVELYNAnd look how that turned out. 
          She turns to HaroldEVELYN (CONT'D)How can any of us know what Hugh
          would've wanted? And would he
          have seen fit to tell us anyway?(BEST)Obviously the flat has to be
          sold.
          (Best, then to Christopher)
          And you're very kind. And dear
          Polly. But no, I won't be coming
          to live with you.9A.11 INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 11Muriel has now been transferred to a ward. She is
          listening to DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR.DR GHUJARAPARTIDARYou need a new hip, Mrs Donnelly.
          It's not a difficult operation.MURIELEasy for you to say, you're not
          having it.DR GHUJARAPARTIDARRegardless. You do need a new

          list for at least six months.MURIELAt my age, I can't plan that far
          ahead. I don't even buy green
          bananas.DR GHUJARAPARTIDARThere is another way. Our
          hospital trust is funding a new
          pilot scheme, that will enable us
          to out-source you to another
          hospital, where they can perform
          the procedure almost immediately,
          and at a fraction of the cost.MURIELIs it local?DR GHUJARAPARTIDARThat depends how you define
          local.12 INT. EVELYN'S FLAT/CHRISTOPHER'S OFFICE - NIGHT 12Evelyn is on the phone to her son Christopher. They're
          both sitting at computers. Evelyn's new-found dexterity is
          impressive.
          Around Evelyn's room are packing boxes, some already full.CHRISTOPHER(ON PHONE)When did you get a computer?EVELYNHow far along is the progress
          bar? The strip at the bottom
          that tells you -CHRISTOPHERI know what it is. What are you
          showing me anyway?11.The webpage has come up. It's a picture of a beautiful old
          building. And underneath is written 'THE BEST EXOTICMARIGOLD HOTEL'.As Christopher gapes in horror, he hears a mellifluous
          Indian voice.INDIAN VOICE'Come and spend your autumn years
          in an Indian palace with the
          sophistication of an English
          country manor. Steeped in the
          tradition of the Raj, tucked away
           on the outskirts of Jaipur .'13 INT. INTERNET CAFE - DAY 13The mellifluous tones continue. Madge mouths the words to
          herself as she scans the same web-page.INDIAN VOICEit exudes historical
          ambience and is graced with
           breathtaking surroundings .'14 INT. SALON - DAY 14Jean whom we earlier saw looking at the bungalow, is at
          the hairdressers. Her stylist ABI listens to her reading a
          computer printout for the same hotel. Which looks classy,
          elegant, and welcoming.
          Madge's voice bleeds into Jean's.JEAN(READING)'Lofty terraces, open courtyards,

          Line towards Heathrow.
          Douglas, Jean's husband, is on the green with his friend
          SIMON. Douglas is lining up a tricky putt.SIMONThere won't be any golf courses.12.DOUGLASJust as well. I can't afford the
          green fees.SIMONBut a retirement home?
          Douglas misses his putt.DOUGLASIt's a luxury development, where
          all the residents are in their
          golden years.SIMONLike the Costa Brava.DOUGLASYes. But with more elephants.
          Simon holes out.16 INT. JUDGES CHAMBERS - DAY 16Graham, the judge, is in his office. It's nearly empty;
          his entire life is being packed away.

          other? And you've never once

          crack on the bottom. But I think
          you might know something about
          that already.

          time ago.17 INT. BASEMENT BEDSIT. EARLS COURT - DAY 17A bedsit. Slightly down at heel, and sparsely furnished.
          Norman, whom we met speed dating, is talking to someone.
          We don't see who.
          Quietly, in the background, Radio 2 music from an old
          battery radio.NORMANI have to go. I do. And I could
          say I wish you'd come, but I've
          never lied to you. We both know
          I need more than you can offer.
          We know that. Don't we?
          We see who's sitting in front of him. An ancient
          dachshund.NORMAN (CONT'D)(to the dog)

          in a wheelchair across a housing estate.MURIELYou know who'll be there, don't
          you? Indians. Loads of them, A
          sea of brown faces and black
          hearts, all greasy haired and
          reeking of spices. Never see one
          on their own, do you? No,
          becuase they hunt in packs. All
          the better to rob me blind and -JACKSONYou know what? You can take it
          from here.MURIELYou're supposed to see me into my
          flat. That's what they said.JACKSONMy wife is from Mumbai.
          He heads off. Muriel shouts after him.MURIELNo good moaning to me, mate. You

          But he's gone.
          Muriel wheels herself on over the bumpy ground.19 EXT. PASSENGER DROP-OFF. STANSTED AIRPORT - EVENING 19A reluctant Christopher is pushing a trolley carrying
          Evelyn's cases to the terminal.CHRISTOPHERYou're sure your tickets are in
          order?EVELYNThey should be. The hotel paid
          for them. I'm sure they'd
          rather have us there than not.
          And its fantastically cheap for
          the first three months.CHRISTOPHERI wonder why.
          They walk on in silence.CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D)How will we know you're alright?15.EVELYNI'll call. They do have phones
          there, you know. Or you can
          just read my blog.CHRISTOPHERYour what?EVELYNOn the interweb. You can log in
          whenever you like, read my news.CHRISTOPHERI just hope the first item will
          be announcing your return. I
          don't suppose they'll be paying
          for the journey back...?
          Evelyn stops. They've reached the terminal.EVELYNCould you please, before I go,
          say one thing that is supportive?
          Because I've never done anything
          like this before.CHRISTOPHERWithout Dad, you never did
          anything at all. And i don't
          think you'll be able to cope.EVELYNWell. I suppose we'll find out,
          won't we?
          They head into the building.20 INT. CHECK-IN AREA. AIRPORT - EVENING 20Madge is at the First Class Check-In desk.MADGEAnd the connecting flight to
          Jaipur is first class too?
          The check-in girl nods, hands Madge back her passport.MADGE (CONT'D)I tell you, it's tough to get
          upgraded nowadays. I had to
          flirt so hard with the travel
          agent, it was practically phone
          sex.21 INT. SECURITY AREA. AIRPORT - EVENING 21The light is fading.15A.Norman appears to be relishing a detailed search from a

          bag, Madam, if you don't mind.
          He lifts the bag onto a table. It's heavier than he
          thought.16.SECURITY GUARD (cont'd)
          What you got in here anyway?
          He opens the bag, stares in astonishment.MURIELPG Tips. Brown sauce. Ten jars
          of Marmite. Thirty one packets
          of Chocolate Hobnobs. Pickled
          onions. Pickled eggs. And
          pickle.SECURITY GUARDNo liquids on the plane.MURIELWhat does that mean?SECURITY GUARDIt means you can't take the
          pickled onions. Or the pickled
          eggs.(BEAT)The pickle's fine.22 INT. BOARDING GATE. AIRPORT - EVENING/NIGHT 22The passengers from Flight 1045 to Delhi are seated at the
          gate, waiting to board.
          Muriel is wheeled up by an attendant and parked at the end
          of the only remaining row of empty chairs. Douglas and
          Jean are already sitting there.
          Jean smiles politely as Graham sits down a couple of seats
          away.
          Norman arrives, carrying his battery radio, sees an empty
          place between Jean and Madge, who is sitting at the end.
          He smiles knowingly at Madge as he sits.
          Finally Evelyn takes the only available space, between
          Graham and Douglas.
          And there the seven passengers wait patiently, unaware of
          their common fate.
          The sound of a jet engine, quiet at first, finally engulfs
          them.23 EXT. RUNWAY. INDIA - DAWN 23The plane cruises down through a stunning sunset, and lands
          at Delhi Airport.17.24 INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL, DELHI - DAY 24Evelyn, Douglas, Jean and Graham are descending on an
          escalator. Madge is a few steps up.JEANObviously one's read one's
          Kipling, but we view this as an
          opportunity to explore another
          culture, as well as making new
          friends. And a retired judge is
          just the class of guest one was
          hoping for, isn't it Douglas?DOUGLASI'm sorry?GRAHAM(TO EVELYN)And is this your first time in
          India?JEANYou don't seem like an
          experienced traveller.EVELYNI'm not. Although one has read
          one's guidebooks.
          Jean blinks. Evelyn and Graham share a smile. Douglas
          hides his. And Madge sees it all.
          As they head towards the baggage carousel, they're met by
          Muriel and Norman, emerging from the elevator. Norman is
          pushing Muriel's wheelchair.NORMANNorman Cousins.MADGEMadge Hardcastle. A pleasure.NORMANPlay your cards right, it could
          be.
          Madge stares at him. A voice comes over the tannoy.AIRPORT ANNOUNCERLadies and gentlemen, we regret
          to inform you that owing to bad
          weather, Flight 105 to Jaipur has
          been cancelled. The airline is
          happy to arrangeCUT TO:18.25 INT. AIRPORT. DELHI - DAY 25Hours later. The airport is deserted, except for the
          Marigold Hotel party, who sit slumped and exhausted on
          another row of seats, with Muriel's wheelchair at the other
          end.
          After a moment, Graham saysGRAHAMAlright. Plan B.26 INT. DELHI AIRPORT - DAY 26Moments later. They're all moving briskly through the hi-
          tech, ultra-modern, beautifully air-conditioned building.JEANOf course it's a good idea. Who
          can you trust if not a High Court
          Judge?DOUGLASAnd this way we see more of the
          country.
          Norman is pushing Muriel's wheelchair.NORMAN(leaning down, toMURIEL)If anyone asks, say you're my
          mother. I don't want people to
          think we're together.MURIELIn your dirty dreams.JEANDouglas, these are not words that
          often pass my lips, but you may
          actually be right. The country
          seems to be rather more civilised
          than one originally thought.27 EXT. DELHI BUS STATION - EVENING 27Moments later. Our heroes are in the middle of an
          extraordinary scene. Stifling heat, deafening noise; the
          chaos, the bustle, the grime, the crowds, the life.
          They're surrounded by taxi drivers, baggage
          handlers,beggars etc. All clamouring for their attention.
          Evelyn looks a little shocked. Jean is traumatized, a
          handkerchief to her face.19.Graham, at the ticket booth, triumphantly holds up a
          fistful of tickets.GRAHAM(shouting over the din)
          The bus will drop us in the
          centre of town. We can take tuk-
          tuks the rest of the way!
          They follow him through the hordes. And see their bus.
          It's absolutely rammed. People are practically hanging out
          of the windows.MADGEThere's not enough room.GRAHAMIt's time to prove the first and
          only rule of India: there's
          always room.
          He starts to fight his way to the door. Evelyn's at the
          back. She stops, for a moment, looks around her.EVELYNWhat larks, Pip.
          Douglas is just ahead of her. He turns, smiles.DOUGLASLet's hope so.28 EXT. HIGHWAY - EVENING 28Muriel's wheelchair is strapped to the back of the bus,
          which is screaming down the six-lane highway. A huge tower
          of luggage is piled precariously on the roof.
          The road appears to be complete chaos; cars, buses, even
          cows overtaking each other.
          The bus pulls into the outside lane to follow a truck which
          is overtaking some slower vehicles. As the truck pulls back
          into the inside lane, it reveals a huge truck barrelling
          towards them on the wrong carriageway.
          Norman, sitting at the front, screams his last scream...NORMANNOOOOOOO... . UAt the last minute, the bus pulls back into the inside
          lane. The Indians on the bus take absolutely no notice.29 INT. BUS - EVENING 29Norman is grinning from ear to ear.20.NORMANI'm loving this!
          Evelyn is sitting next to Madge.EVELYNA few months ago I was organising
          the church flowers.MADGEAre you struggling with the
          feeling you're not in control of
          your circumstances?EVELYNA little.MADGEYou know what the shortest prayer
          in the world is?EVELYNNo.MADGEFuck it.
          Evelyn laughs.MADGE (CONT'D)You're not doing the church
          flowers any more. May as well
          enjoy the ride.
          Douglas is watching a nice Indian family. They're having a
          picnic. The father notices Douglas looking, offers him
          some food.
          Douglas makes the namaste gesture, takes some happily.JEANAre you insane? "Avoid all food
          not from a reputable vendor, it
          will have been washed with impure
          water."
          Douglas keeps eating, with great enjoyment.DOUGLASIt's just a sandwich.JEANMarvellous. Then I'll have the
          ham, cheese, and streptococcus,
          please. Or perhaps the bacteria,
          lettuce and tomato.
          Douglas turns to Muriel.21.DOUGLASWould you like some of this? I
          believe it's aloo ka paratha.MURIELIf I can't pronounce it, I'm not
          eating it.
          The cacophony of horns continues. Jean screams, as another
          collision looms.30 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DUSK 30The last of the light. The bus moves on through a beautiful
          landscape.31 INT. BUS - NIGHT 31Everyone is asleep, or trying to sleep.
          Except Muriel. She reaches into her bag, and carefully
          removes a biscuit. She surreptitiously lifts it to her
          mouth, and starts to chew.
          Madge has fallen asleep on Evelyn's shoulder. But Evelyn
          is still awake, as is Graham.EVELYNHow long since you were here?GRAHAMForty years.EVELYNAs long as I was married.(BEAT)He died recently. My husband.GRAHAMI'm sorry.EVELYND'you think we're going to be
          alright?GRAHAMGod, don't ask me. I'm more
          scared than you are.
          They both smile, sit in silence for a bit.GRAHAM (CONT'D)Yes. I think it's going to be
          extraordinary.22.32 EXT. BUS - DAWN 32The sun rises. A beautiful, pearly dawn.
          The bus drives through the great gates of Jaipur. Below,
          the city shimmers in the heat. It's a magnificent sight.EVELYN (O.S.)What exactly is a tuk-tuk?33 EXT. JAIPUR STREET - DAWN 33Our heroes are squashed into a pair of them, facing
          forwards and backwards, attempting not to swallow too much
          dust as they wheel crazily through the teeming morning
          streets of the city. They stare in amazement at the world
          racing past them.
          A scooter overtakes. A young man is driving, his
          girlfriend riding side-saddle on the back. Her sari
          billows out behind her. Douglas and Evelyn both watch her,
          struck by this image of beauty, youth and vitality.34 EXT. STREET/GARDEN PATH. MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 34The tuk-tuks have pulled up, and our travellers emerge,
          exhausted and dirty, staring through some garden gates at
          the Marigold Hotel. Once a beautiful building, once
          possibly even luxurious, it is clearly in the process of
          being given at least half the face-lift it badly needs.
          Parts of the building are freshly painted, some of the
          ornate balconies are crumbling, and one wall is clad with
          crazily skewed bamboo scaffolding. A huge old tree towers
          over an untended garden, its branches poking into the
          windows of the building.34A EXT. ROOFTOP. MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 34AA young man leans out from an upper balcony to see the
          arrival below: SONNY KAPOOR (early 20's).
          He deposits a paint pot and brush on a parapet, and races
          off across the rooftop.34B EXT. GARDEN PATH/COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 34BDazed and horrified, the travellers wander up the pathway.
          A cow standing in front of them is pushed into the garden
          by a couple of young houseboys who then run to the tuk-tuks
          to collect their luggage.23.34C EXT. STAIRWAY/COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 34CSonny clatters down the steep steps, and comes tearing out
          onto a verandah, as the travellers arrive in the courtyard
          below. He spreads his arms wide.SONNYWelcome to India!!!
          They stare up at him.35 EXT/INT. COURTYARD/HALLWAY.BEDROOM. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 35The courtyard is not without charm, although somewhat
          delapidated. A fountain at the centre does not look as if
          it has seen water in years, and faded awnings are strung up
          haphazardly.
          Sonny is leading Madge into the darkness of the building,
          towards her room.SONNYThis is a building of the utmost
          character, which means that
          perhaps not everything will
          function in the way you expect it
          to. But as the manager and chief
          executive supervising officer of
          the Marigold Hotel, I can tell
          you with great pride that the
          building has stood for centuries,
          and will stand for many more, in
          100% shipshape condition. Please
          follow me, carefully avoiding
          that naughty stone there
          round this corner, leading us
          most successfully all the way to
          . your bedroom!
          The room is very small, comfortable, and tastefully
          decorated. But there's no door.MADGEWhere?SONNYHere. In here.MADGEMy dear man. Rooms have doors.
          What you're showing me here is an
          alcove.SONNYThe door is coming soon, most
          definitely.MADGEHow soon?24.SONNYLet us not concern ourselves with
          details, Mrs Hardcastle. Rather
          than speaking of doors, we should
          instead take pleasure in the
          freedom to roam.MADGEDoes your room have a door?SONNYOh yes.MADGEThen that's where I'll be
          staying.36 EXT. UPPER COURTYARD, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 36Douglas and Jean arrive at their room. Douglas goes in
          through the arched doorway, promptly comes back out again.DOUGLASBird in the room! Bird in the
          room!
          Jean pushes him aside, goes on in. Several pigeons are
          flying around in some panic.37 EXT/INT. VERANDAH/BEDROOM. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 37Evelyn arrives at her room, goes on in.
          The room is light and airy. And rather nice. But all the
          furniture is covered in sheets.
          As Evelyn stands there, Sonny comes rushing in, yanks all
          the sheets off, and runs out again.38 EXT/INT. BEDROOMS/TERRACE. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 38Muriel wheels herself towards her room. Standing inside is
          a male nurse, AJIT.
          Muriel swivels her chair around. Graham is just going into
          his room.MURIELThere's an Indian in there!
          Graham smiles, goes on into his room. Which is dusty, but
          comfortable and pleasant.
          He looks around with satisfaction.25.39 EXT. STAIRWAY, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 39Norman is laboriously climbing the stairs to his room. He
          stops, catches his breath.40 EXT. TERRACE, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 40Ajit is attempting to explain himself to Muriel.MURIELMy what?AJITYour physiotherapist. To help
          with your recovery after the
          operation.MURIELYou're not touching me.AJITTraditionally that is how
          physiotherapy is practised.41 EXT. ROOF, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 41Norman comes out onto the roof of the hotel. His room is
          right in front of him, a kind of penthouse cabin. A bed,
          but not much else. The trees poke in through the open
          window.
          He walks through the room, hangs his battery radio on a
          hook and leans out of the balcony, surveying the view.NORMANThis'll do.42 INT. RECEPTION - DAY 42Jean is confronting Sonny.JEANI want to stay at the other
          hotel, the one in the brochure.SONNYMrs Ainslie, prepare to be

          building!JEANYou've Photoshopped it!SONNYI have offered a vision of the
          future.(MORE)26.SONNY (CONT'D)Of course I had hoped that by now
          it would be the present. But in
          India we have a saying:
          everything will be alright in the
          end. So if it is not alright,
          then it is not yet the end.JEANWhat will start to make this
          alright is for you to give us a
          refund.SONNYOf course if that is what you
          desire, you must have it.
          Absolutely no problem, I will
          refund you completely.JEANYou will? Straight away?SONNYWithout question, Mrs Ainslie, I
          most definitely will. Straight
          away in three months.43 INT. GRAHAM'S ROOM. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 43Graham is taking some things out of his bag: an old map of
          Jaipur, sepia-tinted photographs of a British family during
          the Raj, official documents yellowing with age.
          He picks up a photograph, looks at it.
          From outside, we can hear Ajit, the physiotherapistAJIT (O.S.)a stay of five days and it is
          done under general anaesthesia.
          A hip replacement usually takes
          only two hours44 EXT. TERRACE. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 44Ajit's explanation continues. Muriel is trying not to
          panic.AJITYour surgeon will remove the top
          end of the thigh bone, and insert
          an artificial bone instead. A

          manager.DOUGLASI'm afraid he's dealing with my

          watching.DOUGLAS (CONT'D)Now, did you try jiggling it a
          bit?EVELYNYes, did that.DOUGLASDid you kind of bang it lightly
          on the desk a few times?EVELYNThat too.DOUGLASHmm.
          He twists off the mouthpiece of the receiver, lifts the
          receiver carefully. And blows on it.28.EVELYNHow did you come to be here? In
          India.DOUGLASI invested our - well, my -
          retirement money in our
          daughter's internet company. She
          assured me that as soon as the
          start-up actually started up, and
          the conversion from virtual to
          actual proved sufficiently
          viable, then she would be able to
          pay it all back.EVELYNI'm not sure I understand what
          most of those words mean.DOUGLASIt turns out neither did she.
          Douglas has put the mouthpiece back on, holds the receiver
          to his ear.DOUGLAS (CONT'D)There you are. Good as new.EVELYNReally?DOUGLASNo, of course not. I've got no
          idea what I'm doing.
          Evelyn bursts out laughing.DOUGLAS (CONT'D)Now, would you like me to not fix
          that chair? Because I can do
          that too.45B EXT. STAIRWAY. MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 45BThe houseboys are struggling with the unequal task of

          all our money getting us here,
          and we can't leave till he's made
          some more.
          Muriel has arrived at her table.SONNYGentle friends, you have found
          your way to this place,
          bequeathed to me by my beloved
          father, that I have raised from
          the ruins of his broken dreams,
          and renamed The Best Exotic
          Marigold Hotel For The Elderly
          And Beautiful. Yes, I use the
          words most deliberately...
          Norman is not looking very well at all. Sonny doesn't
          notice, keeps on going.SONNY (CONT'D).You have all heard the chimes

          Norman's head suddenly tips forward, and he falls from his
          chair onto the floor.30.General panic. Everybody crowds round, but no one knows
          what to do.SONNY (CONT'D)Let me through, please. My
          brother is a doctor.
          He kneels next to Norman, and checks his watch as he feels
          for a pulse.
          Everybody waits. And thenSONNY (CONT'D)This man is dead.
          An appalled silence.SONNY (CONT'D)Please, we must cover his face.
          We should preserve his dignity at
          this terrible moment.
          Madge looks around. All there is is a napkin. She passes
          it Sonny, who lays it over the face of Norman.
          Who promptly coughs.DOUGLASHe just coughed. I heard him
          cough!EVELYNHe moved! He's alive!MADGEHe's fainted, that's all.
          Sonny shakes his watch next to his ear. It's stopped.
          Norman sits up.NORMANWhat's going on? Did I nod off?
          Everyone crowds round Norman, helps lift him back up.

          load of clean sheets balanced on his handlebars.
          Shopkeepers on the street are beginning to set out their
          wares.31.EVELYN (V.0.)Day Nine. Old habits die easier

          her, the classified pages of the local newspaper.EVELYN (V.0.)No longer do I reach out in the

          accustomed to the storm of car

          bikes, cows, dust, noise, and laughter.
          Sonny's battered old car has broken down. Madge is in the
          front seat, Douglas and Jean in the back.
          Sonny is aiming a couple of kicks at the engine.EVELYN (V.0.)Can there be anywhere else in the
          world that is such an assault on
          the senses?51 EXT/INT. PUBLIC RECORDS OFFICE, JAIPUR - DAY 51An office out of a Kafka novel; cloth bags containing files
          are piled all around the room, floor to ceiling.
          Graham is seated at a desk, in front of a sober official.
          He is filling in a form.EVELYN (V.0.)Those who know the country of old
          just go about their business.
          But nothing can prepare the
          uninitiated for this riot of

          devices of the ancient observatory than in the female
          tourists who have come to see them...52 EXT. STREET, CENTRAL JAIPUR - DAY 52The chaos and din of the street is even more mind-boggling.
          Madge now has the bonnet up, and is studying the engine.
          Douglas stands in the street, staring in wonderment around
          him.
          Inside the car, Jean looks utterly traumatized, shrinking
          lower in her seat as a horde of kids swarm at the windows,
          shouting, wheedling, gesticulating. Sonny does his best to
          wave them away.EVELYN (V.0.)... for the heat, the motion, the

          Paneer Methi Chaman ...

          He spins the book round, in order to study an illustration
          more intently.54 INT. HOSPITAL, JAIPUR - DAY 54The hospital puts the NHS to shame. It's hi-tech, bright,
          and spanking clean.33.Sonny pushes Muriel through the doors of the lobby. The
          reception area is a forest of dark skin. Muriel is rigid
          with fear.EVELYN (V.0.)Initially you're overwhelmed.
          But gradually you realise: it's
          like a wave. Resist, and you'll
          be knocked over ...
          Sonny is in discussion with some doctors.
          Then he turns to see that Muriel has vanished. Through the
          window Muriel can be seen frantically wheeling herself away
          down the path...

          the city. Kids are everywhere, laughing, shouting, doing
          tricks, begging.
          Evelyn approaches them, holding up a piece of paper.34.EVELYNPlease, can anyone direct me to
          this address?
          Evelyn's piece of paper gets passed around: none of the
          kids can read. An older boy finally points. Suddenly
          there's lots of pointing.EVELYN (CONT'D)Thank you.
          She goes to move, but the kids are still all around her.EVELYN (CONT'D)I'm sorry, I don't . I don't
          really have much ...
          She gives them the contents of her pockets.EVELYN (CONT'D)Alright? Alright now? Goodbye.
          She starts to walk, is surprised that the entire posse of
          kids walks with her. In fact, the group seems to be
          growing exponentially. She looks like the Pied Piper.59 INT. DOUGLAS AND JEAN'S ROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 59Douglas is getting ready to go out. Jean clearly isn't.DOUGLASGraham was talking about this

          rickshaws. All honking horns, all seemingly headed in
          different directions.
          Evelyn has somehow made it to the central reservation. She
          takes a deep breath, and plunges into the maze of traffic,
          heading for the other side.61 EXT. RICKSHAW. SUBURBAN ROAD, JAIPUR - DAY 61Graham is in a rickshaw. The rickshaw driver, PRAVESH, is
          driving it through a neighborhood in transition. Skeletal
          structures of a new India rise above the houses.61A EXT. BUILDING SITE/STREET. JAIPUR - DAY 61ASome kids playing cricket.
          The rickshaw weaves its way through them and comes to a
          halt.
          Graham gets out, and stands in the street, dwarfed by a
          huge modern building, some months away from completion.GRAHAMThis can't be right, surely?PRAVESHI am thinking so, saab.GRAHAMBut there were houses all along
          here . these were homes.PRAVESHI can take you some other
          place..?GRAHAMNo. That'll do for now. Thank
          you.
          He hands over some money, and Pravesh pedals away.
          Graham turns to look at the boys playing cricket. One of
          them, SANJAY, is batting.GRAHAM (CONT'D)Excuse me. There used to beHOUSES HERESANJAYAll knocked down.GRAHAMAnd the people? The families?36.SANJAYThey move.

          taken over, then turns back.GRAHAMDon't grip so tightly with your
          right hand.
          Sanjay looks puzzled.GRAHAM (CONT'D)On the bat. The right is just a
          guide. Keep your left elbow
          high, play down the line of your

          plane. How does the hip feel?MURIELThey must have got lucky.AJITIt's strange. I think the more
          operations they perform, the
          luckier they get.
           He glances down at Muriel, who betrays no signof getting
           Ajit's joke.63 EXT. MARKET. BACK STREETS - DAY 63Evelyn is still searching for the right address. She's
          turned off the main road, and is heading down a narrow side
          streets. The city has become denser, and the walls seem to
          have closed in.
          She pushes her way through the crowded market.37.63A EXT. PASSAGE/COURTYARD - DAY 63AUncertain, Evelyn turns down a narrow alley, and suddenly
          finds herself in an enclosed courtyard strewn with
          makeshift washing lines. The atmosphere is faintly
          threatening.
          As she tries to find her way out, she becomes aware that
          she is being watched: the walls are full of doorways, and
          people have come out to stare at her. She has stumbled
          into their home.
          Evelyn tries to suppress her panic, turning from one face
          to another.EVELYNI'm so sorry. I didn't realise -
          She backs into a kind of flatbed trolley, piled high with
          cooking utensils, which clatter noisily to the ground. She
          goes to pick them up.EVELYN (CONT'D)Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry...
          A man is staring at her: SURESH.SURESHYes.EVELYN (CONT'D)I'm sorry, I'm just trying to get

          yes you can help me?SURESHYes.
          Some of the children who have gathered laugh at this, and
          the tension is broken slightly.EVELYNLet's go with both, shall we?38.63B EXT. STREET. JAIPUR - DAY 63BSuresh's flatbed trike is rolling down the street, piled
          impossibly high with bundles of brightly-coloured textiles.
          On the back, enthroned in the fabric, is Evelyn.64 EXT. WASTELAND - DAY 64Graham is playing cricket with the teenagers. He's good,
          too. He whacks a ball off into the distance.GRAHAM(TRIUMPHANT)YES!A boy runs off to fetch the ball. Graham half-runs, half-
          walks to the other end, then turns for a second run,
          breathing heavily. Then walks back to the crease, gets
          ready for the next delivery.
          It's hot and he's tired, but he hasn't felt this good for
          years.SANJAYGive me the ball. I can take
          him.
          He turns cheerily to Graham.SANJAY (CONT'D)Down is where you're going,
          Uncle.GRAHAMCome on. Do your worst.
          They're both enjoying the banter, as Sanjay heads back to
          the beginning of his run-up, then turns and sprints in to
          bowl.
          As Graham watches Sanjay running towards him, Sanjay seems
          to slow, his movements becoming sluggish, never seeming to
          reach the crease. He looks at the faces of the other boys,
          frozen, waiting. The ball seems to take forever to leave
          Sanjay's hand.
          Graham steps back, completely fails to play a stroke, and
          is bowled.SANJAYThat's what I'm talking about! I
          felt the need, the need for -
          Graham still hasn't moved.SANJAY (CONT'D)Are you alright, Uncle?
          Graham finds his voice at last.39.GRAHAMYes. Yes, I'm fine.65 EXT. STREET/CALL CENTRE BUILDING - DAY 65Suresh brakes, stops outside a glass-clad high-rise

          He rides off. Evelyn looks nervously up at the building.66 INT. OPERATIONS ROOM. CALL CENTRE - DAY 66A brightly-lit open plan office on a high floor of the
          building. The city sprawls magnificently below.
          Partitions divide off the cubicles. Within them sit rows
          of workers, all early 20's, all with headsets clamped to
          their ears. As chaotic as the streets of Jaipur are, this
          place is immaculate, controlled and efficient.

          the exact moment just before it
          dissolves to whip it up to the

          up, heads for the door.69 EXT. FORECOURT. CALL CENTRE - DAY 69Dozens of motorcycles are parked in front of the building.

          path.JEANGood evening, Your Honour.GRAHAMMrs Ainslie. I hope you had a
          good day. What did you get up
          to?JEANWell, I started in my bedroom,
          where I had a lovely couple of
          hours giving all the cockroaches
          names. Then after a lunch that
          will long have a place in my
          heartburn, I came out here
          and stared blindly at a book
          waiting for someone - anyone to
          rescue me. And how glad I am it
          was you.GRAHAMWhy would you not go out?
          There's so much to see.
          Jean had hoped for some appreciation of her wit, and is
          floored by his question. She can hardly understand, let
          alone tell him, the depths of her discomfort.GRAHAM (CONT'D)Open your eyes, Mrs Ainslie. All
          life is here, I tell you.
          Jean stares at him. He goes on through the archway into
          the hotel. Then stops.GRAHAM (CONT'D)I could talk to the chef, if you
          like. Perhaps get you some
          grilled chicken, plain rice.JEANI would appreciate that very
          much.
          Graham goes on in. Jean just sits there. Wishing he'd
          come back out again.44.71 EXT. TERRACE. MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 71Muriel is back. She's in her chair, on the terrace outside
          her room.
          A young hotel worker, ANOKHI, brings out a tray of food to
          her.
          Muriel watches her, but Anokhi is deferential, won't meet
          Muriel's eyes. She puts the tray down and leaves.
          Muriel just sits there, glaring balefully into the night,
          the untouched tray of food by her side.72 EXT. UPPER COURTYARD - NIGHT 72Evelyn comes into the dining area. Graham is there, at a
          table in the corner.GRAHAMGood evening.EVELYNGood evening.
          Evelyn sits at her table.EVELYN (CONT'D)I trust you had a good day?GRAHAMI'd rather hear about yours.EVELYNI got a job. My first. Ever.
          I'm going to be a sort of
          cultural advisor.GRAHAMA role I'm sure you'll perform
          with great distinction.
          He's about to inquire further, when Evelyn sees Douglas and
          Jean emerge from their room.EVELYNPerhaps if you wouldn't mind
          keeping that news to yourself.GRAHAMI'm flattered you shared it with
          me.

          about. A place of meditation and
          peace, quite stunning.JEANSo spiritual, I bet you hardly
          noticed the smell of elephant
          dung.DOUGLASNo elephants, sadly. Still none.(TO GRAHAM)I thought I might see you there.
          Where did you get to instead?JEANYes, where do you get to every
          day?GRAHAMWell, I've just finished telling
          Mrs Greenslade all about it.
          Evelyn registers the lie, but says nothing.JEANI'm sure she wouldn't mind
          hearing it again.
          She waits. But Graham is as elusive as he is tactful.GRAHAMI talked to the chef for you. He
          said it will be no problem.JEANDid you hear that, Douglas?
          Plain grilled food; manna from

          temple.46.EVELYNI'd like that very much.DOUGLASBut maybe take a clothes peg for
          your nose.73 EXT. COURTYARD/UPPER VERANDAH, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 73Graham and Evelyn emerge through the arch heading for their
          rooms.
          Graham starts down the stairs.EVELYNGoodnight.GRAHAMGoodnight to you.
          He seems about to say something else. She waits for a
          moment, then walks on.GRAHAM (CONT'D)Mrs Greenslade?EVELYNEvelyn.GRAHAMCan I show you something?74 INT. GRAHAM'S ROOM - NIGHT 74Moments later. Evelyn is sitting in front of Graham's
          collage.GRAHAMI grew up here. Just a short
          drive away. It was a big house,
          and we had servants, everyone
          did. We knew their wives, their
          children. One boy, Manoj, became
          my friend. We played a lot of
          cricket together, played anything
          we could. And that's how it
          stayed for years. Until one
          night, he became something more.(BEAT)We had a few months, we had that.
          There was a weekend in Udaipur,
          we sat by a lake and watched the
          sun go down, and I remember
          thinking . I will never be this
          happy again. And I was right.
          Because quite suddenly it was
          over. We'd fallen asleep, and
          they found us.(MORE)47.GRAHAM (CONT'D)(BEAT)For me it was bad enough. But I
          already knew who I was, and I
          think my family had guessed. For
          Manoj, the disgrace was absolute;
          a double taboo. His father was
          fired, they were sent away, all
          of them. I don't know what I
          could've done, but it should've
          been more than nothing. I put up
          no fight. I let it happen.(BEAT)Soon afterwards I went to
          England, to University. I always
          told myself I'd come back. But I
          never did.EVELYNUntil now.GRAHAMAnd now I think .. what if I am
          the last person on earth he wants
          to see?
          Evelyn says nothing.GRAHAM (CONT'D)I don't think I can go through
          with it.EVELYNDo you want to see him again?GRAHAMYes. Yes. Oh yes.EVELYNThen you must.75 EXT. TEMPLE/STREET. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 75As the bell tolls, the faithful arrive at the temple for
          morning prayers.75A EXT. UPPER VERANDAH/SERVANTS COURTYARD - DAY 75AEvelyn stands outside her room, listening to the bells,
          sipping a cup of tea, pensive. She looks down into a
          dilapidated part of the building, where the staff are
          housed. Women in bright saris go about their business.76 INT/EXT. MURIEL'S ROOM/VERANDAH, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 76From her wheelchair, Muriel is re-making her bed. She
          tucks in a perfect hospital corner.48.She looks up. Anokhi is on the verandah, replacing her
          untouched supper tray with breakfast. Anokhi is about to
          leave, but stops.
          Then she goes to fetch Muriel's jar of pickle from the
          windowsill, and places it on the table.
          Muriel watches, then wheels herself outside, looks at the
          tray.
          From outside, Sonny's voicecan be heard.SONNY (O.S.)And so now that we are fully
          operational, Mr Maruthi, it is
          clear that with a small injection
          of funds for the Phase Two
          Development ...77 EXT. GARDEN/COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 77Brimming with confidence, Sonny is walking a wealthy
          investor, MR MARUTHI, around the grounds. Some builders
          are dismantling scaffolding.SONNY.. the Best Exotic Marigold
          Hotel can rise like a phoenix to
          its previous state of glory. And
          when I say small injection, I
          mean small in the sense of medium-
          sized. Possibly larger.MR MARUTHIThis hotel was never glorious.SONNYJust the phoenix part then.MR MARUTHIHow many rooms will there be?SONNYMany.MR MARUTHIHow many?SONNYA great amount. Plenty of rooms,
          no question.
          They've arrived in the courtyard.SONNY (CONT'D)I am not a details man, Mr
          Maruthi.49.MR MARUTHINor was your father.
          They see Muriel on her verandah.SONNYMr Maruthi, I present to you one
          of our beloved guests. Dear Mrs
          Donnelly, please describe in as
          much detail as you desire your
          experience of the ambience and
          atmosphere of the Best Exotic
          Marigold Hotel.MURIELKill me. Kill me now.
          Sonny steers Mr Maruthi towards the reception, speaks
          quietly.SONNYThe wheel is spinning. But the
          hamster is dead.
          He stops, as he sees an elegant older woman standing in the
          doorway. This is the redoubtable MRS KAPOOR.SONNY (CONT'D)Mummyji! What are you doing
          here?MRS KAPOORYou called. I came.SONNYI couldn't have called. The
          phones don't work.MRS KAPOORThat's why I came.78 INT. SONNY'S OFFICE. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 78Moments later. Sonny closes the door behind him.
          His mother starts going through the contents of his desk.MRS KAPOORWho was that man out there?SONNYThe contents of this desk are
          mine. Don't open the drawers. I
          must insist you don't open the
          drawer.
          Mrs Kapoor opens the drawer.50.SONNY (CONT'D)Tell me why you have come.MRS KAPOORDo I need a reason to visit my
          favourite son?SONNYNo. He is in his mansion in
          Delhi.MRS KAPOORMy second favourite.SONNYHe went to Kerala to make his
          fortune.MRS KAPOORBut make it, he did.SONNYAs I will make mine. I have a
          dream, Mummyji. A most brilliant
          one: to out-source old age. And
          not just for the British. There
          are many other countries where
          they don't like old people too.MRS KAPOORYour brothers own a third of the
          hotel each, they are entitled to
          a third of the profits.SONNYSuccess does not happen
          overnight, Mummyji. This is blue
          sky thinking, and it requires
          long-term strategy and patience.MRS KAPOORHow is your girlfriend?SONNYI look forward to you meeting
          her.MRS KAPOORAnd I look forward to you meeting
          the woman you will marry. She is
          from a good family in Delhi.SONNYI can marry as I choose, Mummyji.
          I need no permission.MRS KAPOORI presume it is your girlfriend
          who teaches you such nonsense.
          One reason not to marry her.51.SONNYWhat if I love her?MRS KAPOORAn even better reason. Now send
          Young Wasim to the car for my
          luggage.SONNYHe cannot carry, he has a dicky
          back ... wait, your luggage? How
          long are you staying?MRS KAPOORAs long as it takes.79 INT. BATHROOM. DOUGLAS AND JEAN'S. MARIGOLD HOTEL - 79DAYJean is looking out of her bathroom window, down into the
          courtyard.
          She sees Graham come out of his room. She turns back to
          the mirror, looks at herself.80 EXT. MURIEL'S TERRACE. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 80Near to Muriel, Anokhi is sweeping the floor.MURIELYou won't get the dirt out like
          that.
          Anokhi just smiles at her radiantly.MURIEL (CONT'D)I worked in service for years,
          looked after a lovely house. I
          kept it spotless. You need a bit
          more pressure on that brush.
          Graham walks past, on his way out.GRAHAMShe won't speak English. She's
          what used to be called an
          Untouchable. An outcast, born
          below society. To a good Hindu,
          even her shadow is polluted.
          He greets Anokhi in Hindi, and heads for the door.MURIELWhere d'you go every day? Is it
          a woman? Nip round there for a
          curry and a bit of afters?52.GRAHAMI don't think so. I'm gay.
          Although nowadays more in theory
          than practice. Good day.
          He leaves. A moment later, Jean comes rushing out.
          Immediately she realises two things; first, that Graham has
          already gone. And second, that Muriel is watching her.JEANGood morning.
          Muriel says nothing.JEAN (CONT'D)Lovely day.
          Still nothing from Muriel.JEAN (CONT'D)Lovely.(BEAT)Lovely.
          She turns and goes back in.
          Muriel thinks for a while, then turns to Anokhi.MURIELLong old life, isn't it?81 EXT. VICEROY CLUB - DAY 81A classic colonial building, straight out of the English
          Raj.
          Madge is being shown around by an elderly secretary, MRDHARUNA.MR DRARUNAThe Viceroy Club was opened by
          the great Lord Kitchener himself,
          and many of the fixtures have
          remained unchanged since then.MADGEYes, I see that. Perhaps you
          could tell me a little about the
          clientele? Any maharajahs?
          Wealthy widowed land-owners?MR DHARUNAIt is not the policy of this club
          to divulge details of our
          members.
          They go past a very handsome older Indian man. Who
          radiates wealth and privilege.53.MR DHARUNA (cont'd)
          Good morning, Your Excellency.MADGEWhere do I sign up?MR DHARUNAThe admission fee is 120,000
          rupees, and thereafter 15,000
          rupees each month.MADGEI wonder if I might get a little
          discount. Owing to my status.MR DHARUNAYour status, madam?MADGEYes. One was rather hoping to
          fly under the radar, but one is a
          member of the Royal Family.MR DHARUNAWhich member, madam?MADGEI'm Princess Margaret.MR DHARUNA(BOWING SLIGHTLY)It is most surely an honour to
          meet you. And may I say how well
          you look. Especially taking into
          account that you died nine years
          ago.(BEAT)Your real name please, madam.
          And 120,000 rupees.82 INT. PUBLIC RECORDS OFFICE - DAY 82Graham comes into the chaotic office.
          The bookish official, MR CHIDAMBRAM, is behind the desk.GRAHAMGood morning.MR CHIDAMBRAMGood morning, Sir. Did I not say
          that we will contact you when
          there is information regarding
          your inquiry?GRAHAMYes, you did say that. You did.54.MR CHIDAMBRAMWhile it is most pleasant to see
          you, your presence does not
          actually accelerate our
          investigation.GRAHAMI'll try not to come in tomorrow.MR CHIDAMBRAMI expect I will see you then.83 INT. CALL CENTRE - DAY 83None of the operators are on the phone. Instead they are
          sitting in a semi-circle, looking curiously at Evelyn. Who
          is sitting next to Jay, a little daunted by the attention.EVELYN.You ring in the morning.
          Let's assume the person answering
          will be a woman. She will have
          had her breakfast. Tea or
          coffee. Semi-skimmed milk,
          always. If she's under 50 she'll
          be contemplating yet another
          diet, over 50 she'll have more or
          less given up, and be eating
          toast. The radio may be playing,
          or more likely daytime TV. A
          chat show, or a programme with a
          moderator speaking to a panel of
          young women whose boyfriends have
          all slept with their mothers.
          The girlfriends' mothers, I mean,
          not their own. Although
          Anyway, then the boyfriends
          usually come out, and everybody
          fights.
          Sunaina is in the audience. She calls out.SUNAINAI'm not surprised people hang up
          on us.
          Laughter.EVELYNThat's the point. When the phone
          rings and it's this robot
          nobody wants a machine, but it's
          almost worse when it's a person
          behaving like one. All these
          sales cliches just strung
          together. 'Your call is
          important to us'. Is it? Well
          then sound like it.55.SUNAINA'Your custom is valuable'.EVELYNRight. That one. Don't ever say
          that.SUNAINA'Service is our middle name'.EVELYNYes, when your middle name isACTUALLYSUNAINAShantanu.EVELYNWhich is beautiful. You people
          are young, vibrant, real. I'm
          sure the typical housewife would
          enjoy talking to each and every
          one of you.SUNAINAHer morning sounds like fun.
          What are you doing here?
          Beat.EVELYNI suppose I'm not typical
          anymore.(TO JAY)Is that the sort of thing?84 INT. MADGE'S ROOM - EVENING 84Madge is at her mirror, doing her make-up with great care.
          She looks beautiful.85 EXT. VICEROY CLUB BAR - EVENING 85Madge walks up the gravel path towards the magnificent
          building. She's superbly dressed, looks great. She goes
          up to the BARMAN.MADGEExcuse me. Would there be any
          wealthy single men in tonight?BARMANThere is one.
          Madge puts some money into his breast pocket.56.MADGEPerhaps you could seat me next to
          him?BARMANThis way, madam.
          He leads her along across the terrace. Madge follows,
          checking her hair, her breath, etc.
          The barman reaches an ornate suite of furniture. There's
          someone sitting there, his back to us, an elegant arm
          draped over the side of the chair.BARMAN (CONT'D)His Royal Highness Prince Michael
          of Kent.
          The man rises from his chair and turns. And Madge is left
          staring at Norman.
          There's a pause. Then Madge reaches into the barman's
          breast pocket, and removes her money.MADGEI'll have that back, thank you
          very much.86 EXT. MARIGOLD HOTEL - EVENING 86Graham comes through the courtyard, heads for his room.
          Muriel is on her verandah.GRAHAMGood evening.
          Muriel nods at him, and he goes on into his room.
          A moment later, Jean sits down next to Muriel.JEANYou know where he goes. I know
          you know. But you won't tell me.
          Muriel says nothing.JEAN (CONT'D)I can get Hobnobs out here, you
          know. I know a way.(BEAT)As many as you want. Milk or
          plain.

          reaching down deep into the earth, so people can climb down
          to get their water.
          Young couples sit on the steps in the evening heat, boys
          leap into the water.
          Sonny and Sunaina are watching the swimmers.SONNYMy father used to bring me to
          this well to swim. He said the
          water was better, and so were the
          people we would meet.(BEAT)He would have liked you so much.
          Sunaina smiles at this.SONNY (CONT'D)My mother doesn't want us to be
          married.SUNAINAShe hasn't met me yet.SONNYShe doesn't need to meet you
          Sunaina absorbs this.SONNY (CONT'D)She knows you are not from Delhi.
          That you have no family money,
          and work in a call centre. You
          are a part of a new India she
          cannot welcome.SUNAINAIsn't this where you tell her
          what you want?SONNYThat conversation will be easier
          when the hotel is a success.SUNANINADo you love me?58.SONNYI have found a new investor. I
          am most optimistic that he will
          enable us to move forward with
          Phase Two of the Marigold HotelPROJECTSUNANINAShouldn't you finish Phase One
          first?SONNYIn business, if you stand still,
          you move backwards. No, I have
          that wrong. If you stand still,
          you are overtaken by people going
          the other way. Wait -SUNAINAYou didn't answer the question.
          Do you love me?SONNYMy feelings for you cannot be
          reduced to a single word.SUNAINAIt's a nice word, Sonny. And
          people like hearing it.SONNYSunaina, please. My mother is
          wrong. It is you who are too good
          for me.SUNANINAYou say that a lot. You
          shouldn't I'll start to believe
          you.
          They watch the boys in the water.88 INT. VICEROY CLUB BAR - NIGHT 88Madge and Norman are sitting together. Norman is looking
          across at the bar, where an attractive older ex-pat lady is
          sitting, thus far resisting Norman's attempts to catch her
          eye.NORMANI still think you're cramping my
          style.MADGEPlease. You have no style to
          cramp.58A.NORMANThat lady at the bar keeps
          looking at me.MADGEAs one would something in a
          museum.NORMANWhy must you mock? I just want
          to feel young again, to be needed
          as much as I need, if only for
          one night, one wonderful night.
          Tell me you don't know how that
          feels.59.Silence for a bit.MADGEGive me a minute. Then join us.
          She gets up, heads towards the bar. Where she sits a
          couple of seats away from the woman. Who is called CAROL.
          She sits there a moment, then sighs, and starts to talk to
          the barman.MADGE (CONT'D)Rejected again. Many years ago,
          that man over there gave me the
          most extraordinary night of my
          life. He may seem coarse and
          uncouth, but that only disguises
          a tenderness and an exquisite
          sensitivity to a woman's needs
          Norman arrives at the bar.NORMANThose drinks not ready yet?
          Madge turns to Carol.MADGEThey say patience is passion
          tamed.

          Madge winces.CAROLI suppose.NORMANGreat.
          Silence.60.MADGESo what brings you to Jaipur,
          Carol?NORMANYes, Carol. What brings you to
          Jaipur?CAROLI run a small boutique travel
          agency. But I've actually lived
          here all my life. My father
          worked in the Foreign Office.
          Another silence.NORMANYou're very fit.CAROLI beg your pardon?MADGEOh god.NORMANI mean you look like you keep
          yourself in shape. Physically.CAROLWell, I did join a gym last year.
          It cost a fortune, and I didn't
          get any fitter. Apparently you
          have to actually go.
          Madge laughs. Norman doesn't. Then realizes that it was a
          joke, lets out a too-loud bray of laughter.CAROL (CONT'D)And so what do you do, Norman?NORMANMe?CAROLYes.NORMANOh. I'mMADGENorman's in business.CAROLReally?NORMANYes.61.CAROLWhat business?NORMAN(TO MADGE)You tell her.MADGEImport-Export.NORMANAlthough these days there's
          rather more Ex- than Im-, if you
          see what I mean.CAROLI'm afraid I don't.
          Madge gets up.MADGEI have to splash some water on my
          face. Please God I drown in it.
          She heads for the bathroom.
          Norman and Carol share another silence.CAROLWell look, it's been lovely
          chatting.NORMANNo it hasn't.CAROLNo. It hasn't. But I reallyMUST -NORMANCarol?
          She was about to go, stops.NORMAN (CONT'D)Can we drop all this pretence?
          And start again? I'm not
          charming. I'm not good at
          repartee. And I'm not a
          plutocrat with the sexual

          adapt, my god, the riches that
          are available.
          Madge looks across the bar. And is startled to see Norman
          and Carol chatting up a storm, laughing together.
          As she watches, Norman orders more drinks, then turns
          smiling back to his new friend.
          Madge walks slowly out of the bar, and into the night.90 INT. EVELYN'S ROOM. MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 90Evelyn is at her computer, typing.EVELYN (V.0.)There is no past that we can

          it's not healthy for you to spend
          all day and every day in the
          confines of the hotel.
          He goes back into the bathroom. Jean changes the subject.JEANI didn't sleep a wink. The tap
          in there never stops dripping.DOUGLAS (O.S.)I talked to Young Wasim about it.JEANWhat did he say?DOUGLAS (O.S.)No idea. It was in Hindi.

          He goes.
          Jean sits for a while, looking utterly disconsolate and
          lost. Then she gets up, goes over to the balcony.
          Down below she can see Graham leaving.95 EXT. LOWER COURTYARD - DAY 95Madge is sitting on a chair. Norman arrives.NORMANYour Madgesty.MADGEI gather the night went well.NORMANWould you like to hear about it?MADGENot in the least.NORMANGood. Because you're going to.

          hundred times, and snaps her book shut. She stands, then
          sits again.
          Then stands.98 EXT. SWEEPER COLONY - DAY 98Ajit is now pushing Muriel through a poverty-stricken slum.
          The people live on the streets, or in collapsing tin
          shacks. Everywhere there is struggle and deprivation.
          And yet the pervasive atmosphere is nowhere near as
          depressing as we would expect. The colours are bright, the
          smiles on the children's faces even brighter.
          Not that Muriel can recognise the joy, of course. She's
          horrified by her surroundings. And acutely aware of the
          stares of the slum-dwellers.98A EXT. ANOKHI'S HUT - DAY 98AA primitive brick and cement hut, one of the few amongst
          dwellings made mostly from sticks and plastic bags.

          wheelchair, pushing it around and taking turns to sit on
          it.68.99 INT. ANOKHI'S HUT - DAY 99Muriel sits on the only chair.
          Opposite - squashed together as if posing for a photograph -
          are all the generations of Anokhi's family: Anokhi herself,
          her husband, mother, grandmother, and several children.
          They all smile at Muriel.
          A long pause. Then Muriel turns to Ajit.MURIELHow soon can I leave?100 INT/EXT. HARDWARE SHOP - DAY 100Douglas is talking to JAMSHED, who works behind the
          counter. Evelyn sits outside.DOUGLASYou see what I think, and of
          course I'm no expert, is that the
          valve seat has eroded, so we'll
          need the washer changed and a new
          seat re-ground.
          Douglas glances back at Evelyn. Who betrays not the
          slightest scepticism.
          Jamshed studies the tap.JAMSHEDThe gland nut has come away from
          the spindle.DOUGLASWell of course, it could be that
          too. Can you fix it?JAMSHEDNot cheaply. Not cheaply. Most
          expensively indeed.
          Jamshed takes the tap to a workstation at the back, starts
          to fiddle with it. Douglas joins Evelyn.DOUGLASI was in a tuk-tuk the other day,
          didn't seem to be taking the
          usual route back to the hotel.
          It turned out that the driver had
          decided to take me to another
          hotel, that he was sure I would
          prefer. And of course one wants
          to believe that he genuinely had
          my welfare at heart, and that it
          wasn't run bg his brother-in-law.(MORE)69.DOUGLAS (CONT'D)One wants to trust, in general,
          don't you think? But you never
          really know, do you?
          Jamshed stops fiddling with the tap. And takes a hammer to
          it.EVELYNThe day I met my husband was the
          day the fair came to town. My
          girlfriend and I went on the
          carousel. Her horse was fine.
          But when the ride began I felt
          mine give a little, like it might
          collapse. Then these strong arms
          were around me, holding the horse
          together. And a voice in my ear
          said "Just trust me". And I did.
          Without question. Until the day
          he died.DOUGLASHow wonderful.EVELYNThe sale of our flat went through
          last week. I had to sell it to
          pay off Hugh's debts.(BEAT)I've been forced to get a job out
          here. Which, in fact, I love.
          But even at Sonny's rates, I
          still couldn't make ends meet.
          After what my own husband did to
          our life savings.(BEAT)So no. You're right. You never
          know.
          Jamshed holds up the tap. Which is now in several parts.JAMSHEDNo good. You must be buying
          another.101 EXT. PATHWAY/GATE/STREET, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 101Jean walks down the path to the gate.
          She stops, looks fearfully at the chaotic sea of humanity
          outside. She's unable to move.
          Finally, she steps out. And is of course immediately
          assaulted by the assorted kids, beggars, street vendors,
          etc.
          As anxiety begins to engulf her, she quickens her pace,
          brushing through them as best she can, until she is almost
          running.70.102 INT. ANOKHI'S HUT - DAY 102Muriel is still at the tea party.

          if you do not.
          Muriel looks up. They're all still watching, waiting
          smiling.
          She looks at Anokhi's grandmother, as dignified as she is
          old.
          Muriel reaches out, takes something off the tray. And has
          a bite. It's not too bad.MURIELI'd still rather a Scotch Egg.
          Then she sees something through the open doorway: the
          children have turned her wheelchair on its side and are
          spinning the wheels.
          She's on her feet in a flash.MURIEL (CONT'D)Get off! Get off it, you dirty
          thieving bastards!
          Several terrified faces turn.
          One little girl starts to cry.
          Everyone is staring at Muriel.MURIEL (CONT'D)I didn't see. They were playing.

          She walks down another corridor. Then stops.
          Through a doorway, she sees Graham at the desk, talking to

          There is no shame. You do not
          have to sneak.(BEAT)All the same, if you did want to
          be very quiet, and not let anyone
          see you, it couldn't hurt.111 INT. CONSULTING ROOM - DAY 111Norman is talking to DR RAMA.NORMANI'm worried there's no lead in my

          woman?NORMANWhat's today?DR RAMAMonday.NORMANSix years.DR RAMAI've got some pills that'll help.112 EXT. SERVANTS COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 112The back of the hotel, where Sonny envisages his Phase Two
          development. Very dilapidated.
          Anokhi is cleaning pots. Young Wasim sits in the corner.
          Ajit has just wheeled Muriel into the courtyard.MURIEL(TO ANOKHI)I wanted to tell you something...
          Anokhi looks up.MURIEL (CONT'D)(TO AJIT)Tell her. Tell her I was glad to
          come, glad she invited me.
          Ajit translates.MURIEL (CONT'D)Glad to meet her family. Her
          grandmother. Her kids.
          Ajit translates. Anokhi speaks.80.AJITShe asks if you have children?MURIELI looked after somebody else's.
          Ajit translates.MURIEL (CONT'D)This one family, years I was with
          them. I ran the house, looked
          after the money, did it all,
          cared for them like they were my
          own.
          Ajit starts to translate. But Muriel doesn't wait.MURIEL (CONT'D)That's the mistake, see. You
          don't want to get like that, to
          start feeling part of something.
          One day they decided I needed
          some help. I was grateful, I
          tried to teach her. Not just the
          books, but how to crisp up the
          bacon like the gentleman
          preferred it, the way the little
          one liked to have her hair
          brushed. The things you only
          know if you care. But then they
          said I was no longer useful to
          them. Thanked me for my service.
          As if that's all it was.(BEAT)I got a flat in the end. I'm the
          only one in the building not a
          foreigner. More Indians there
          than here! But before I came to
          this place, my biggest problem
          was what to do with all the time
          I had. Because that flat's so
          small, I can have the whole place
          spotless in half an hour. And
          then what am I supposed to do for
          the rest of the day?
          There's silence for a bit. Then Ajit speaks.AJITDid you want me translate that as
          well?
          Muriel smiles. It's the first time we've seen this.
          Muriel stops, thrusts something into Ajit's hand.MURIELGive her these.81.Ajit hands Anokhi what Muriel gave him: a packet of
          Chocolate Hobnobs.
          This time it's Muriel who cannot meet Anokhi's eye. Tries
          to hide her desire to leave. Ajit turns her chair and
          pushes her away.
          Over this, the sound of singing113 EXT. ROOFTOP. MARIGOLD HOTEL - EVENING 113Norman's on his rooftop, under the primitive spout of water
          that passes as his shower. Hanging from a nail in the wall,
          the battery radio is pumping out a bizarre Indian cover
          version of the Chic song "Le Freak".
          Norman is naked, and singing along lustily.NORMANAaaaaah, freak out! Le freak,
          c'est chic .. Aaaah, freak out!
          Feet slapping in the soapy water, he performs a nifty disco
          move.114 INT. SONNY'S OFFICE. MARIGOLD HOTEL - EVENING 114Sonny is in his office, going through the accounts.
          There's a strange ringing somewhere nearby. He pays no
          attention, then stops and thinks for a moment. Then
          realises what it is.
          He sweeps the pile of papers off the desk, starts
          frantically looking for the telephone.115 EXT. UPPER COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - EVENING 115Graham and Evelyn are having drinks.EVELYNI've been getting out and about
          as much as I can, but I feel I've
          hardly scratched the surface. And
          of course I'd love to see
          Udaipur. The lake you talked
          about.GRAHAMI'd love to take you. Perhaps -
          He breaks off. Douglas and Jean have come in. Jean looks
          rather desperate.EVELYN AND DOUGLAS(SIMULTANEOUSLY)Good evening.81A.An awkward moment. Graham stands.82.GRAHAMGood evening, Mrs Ainslie.
          Please allow me.
          He pulls a chair out for her. She shoots him a look of
          passionate gratitude for his exquisite sensitivity.JEANYou're very kind. But I rather
          think I'll turn in early.
          Goodnight everyone.
          She goes into her room.116 EXT. COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - EVENING 116Muriel is sitting outside her room, doing the crossword.
          Madge is coming through the arch, stops dead.
          Norman is standing in front of her, on his way out. He
          looks transformed. And rather handsome.MADGEIs this it?NORMANThis is it.MADGEYou're not worried about the
          danger of having sex at your age?
          Norman shrugs.NORMANIf she dies, she dies.
          He leaves. Sonny sprints into the courtyard.SONNYProgress, Mrs Donnelly, Mrs
          Hardcastle! The wheel is turning
          most assuredly in our favour!
          He shoots up the stairs.117 EXT. UPPER COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - EVENING. 117Douglas, Graham and Evelyn are looking at the menu.
          Sonny bursts in.SONNYMr Dashwood! Everybody! Great

          working!GRAHAMThat is great news. What are

          He runs off. Comes back.SONNY (CONT'D)Oh wait. You have a phone call.118 EXT. STREET, POOR NEIGHBOURHOOD. JAIPUR - EVENING 118Graham, Evelyn, and Douglas are walking quickly up a quiet
          street.GRAHAMIt's a false alarm. There's no
          way they could find anything in
          that office. They probably just
          picked an address at random, just
          to keep me off their backs. I'm
          sure that's what happened. It's
          going to be nothing. Don't you
          think it's going to be nothing?EVELYNI think you should knock on the
          door and see.GRAHAMYes. Yes I should.(BEAT)Yes.119 EXT. HOUSE - EVENING 119Some men sit under a tree, playing cards.84.Across the street, Graham approaches a house. At a polite
          distance, Evelyn and Douglas wait. Graham knocks at the
          open door.
          A woman, GAURIKA, appears. She stares at Graham.GRAHAMI'm sorry to disturb you so late.
          My name is Graham Dashwood. A
          long time ago I -GAURIKAI know who you are.
          Beat.GRAHAMI am afraid I don't know you.GAURIKAI am Gaurika. The wife of Manoj.GRAHAM(after a fraction of aBEAT)I'm very pleased to meet you.
          And if you could, if you would
          tell him that I called around,
          I'd appreciate that very much,AND -He breaks off. She's walked past him, looking to the other
          side of the road.
          He turns to look at the men playing cards. Gaurika calls in
          Hindi.
          A beautiful-looking man looks up. MANOJ.
          He looks across at the house. Stands up slowly as Graham
          walks across the street towards him.
          Graham reaches him. The two men just stand there for a
          moment. Then they hug very tightly.
          From the steps of the house, Gaurika watches.
          Evelyn looks at her, fascinated.
          Across the street, Manoj and Graham are still holding each
          other, unable to let go.120 EXT. STREET - NIGHT 120Douglas and Evelyn are walking.DOUGLAS(a tiny bit sloshed)(MORE)85.DOUGLAS (CONT'D)First time going in to London
          with my dad, on his commute...
          He'd always been so extraordinary
          to me, so unique. But there he
          was standing on the station
          platform, utterly
          indistinguishable from all the
          other men in suits. And then of
          course a few years later I was
          one of them... Hated my job.
          Hated it.(BEAT)Sorry, talking too much. Blame a
          good dinner out.EVELYNWhat was she thinking?DOUGLASI beg your pardon?EVELYNHis wife. Manoj's wife. She
          knew who Graham was. Had he told
          her?(BEAT)D'you think we'll find out

          been reading all about it.EVELYNTell me.DOUGLASI would, if I could remember a
          word.
          Evelyn laughs. Then Douglas suddenly grabs her. And pulls
          her out of the way of a motor bike, zooming past them.
          Sunaina hasn't realised she nearly hit them, and powers on
          towards the Marigold.
          Douglas and Evelyn stand for a moment, startled, holding
          each other. Something passes between them that embarrasses
          them both. Then they part quickly, guiltily.
          They're outside a small restaurant, and with exquisite
          timing, a group of musicians start to play a romantic tune.WAITERCome, please. Nice meal,
          please...86.DOUGLAS(NAMASTE GESTURE)We've eaten, thank you...
          They continue on their way. Slightly further apart than
          before.121 EXT. MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 121It's the middle of the night, and everything's quiet Or
          as quiet as it can be in the middle of the usual night-time
          Indian cacophony.
          Sunaina parks her bike outside the hotel, goes on in.122 INT. BEDROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 122Sonny is sleeping peacefully.123 EXT. COURTYARD, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 123Sunaina moves across the courtyard.

           beside the sleeping figure.128 INT. BEDROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 128A loud scream.
          In a different bed, in a different room, Sonny wakes up.
          And remembers.87.129 INT. BEDROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 129It's Sunaina that's screamed. Because she's in bed with
          Madge.
          Who couldn't be happier.MADGEA midnight booty call. How
          utterly marvellous.130 INT. CORRIDOR, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 130Sonny hares out of his temporary bedroom, and races down
          the corridor, towards Madge's room.131 INT. BEDROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 131Sunaina has jumped out of the bed and across the room,
          grabbing one of Madge's generous scarves to cover her
          nakedness.SUNAINAI'm so sorry, I'm so sorry . I
          don't know what your name is, but
          I'm incredibly sorry.MADGEDon't be. Most action I've had

          with deep and profound sincerity -SUNAINAHow could you not tell me you
          weren't in your room!88.SONNYYes, Sunaina, to you too I must

          She sees the nearly-naked Sunaina.

          No no no no no. No! This is a
          respectable hotel, not a brothel.(TO SUNAINA)You, get out.(TO MADGE)And Mrs Hardcastle, I expected

          Mrs Kapoor turns to Sunaina. Who is speechless.MRS KAPOORThis is the sort of woman you
          are. OK. Each to her own. But

          setting up their stalls, spreading their wares on rugs on
          the ground.
          One trader is unloading some fruit. A few guava roll off
          the edge of his wagon.
          Someone picks them up for him. It's Graham, who smiles as
          he puts them back. The trader gives him a fresh one.
          Graham takes it, and walks on, munching the delicious
          fruit. A contented man.134 EXT. GARDEN. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAWN 134Norman is sitting on a stone bench under a spreading tree.90.GRAHAM (O.S.)How did it go?
          Norman turns, to see Graham standing above him.NORMANI have seen the top of the
          mountain. And it is good.
          Graham nods, sits down next to him. They gaze out at the
          waking city.GRAHAMI saw someone yesterday, a man I
          hadn't seen for many years. A
          man I've loved all my life.
          Norman is a bit startled by this.NORMANA man... .?GRAHAMYes.NORMANCarry on.GRAHAM(smiling, unperturbed)
          I didn't know how he'd been in
          the meantime, didn't want to
          guess. I brought disgrace upon
          him and his family, and imagined
          he might hate me for it.(BEAT)But we talked all night. He's
          been happy. He's led a peaceful
          life, married to a woman who
          understood him and loved him
          nonetheless. But he's never
          forgotten me. That's what he
          said.(BEAT)I asked his forgiveness anyway.
          He said he had nothing to forgive
          me for. That instead I should
          forgive myself.(BEAT)All that time. All that time I
          believed I'd sentenced him to a
          life of shame. When I was the
          one in prison.(BEAT)But not any more.91.Silence for a while.NORMANTop of the mountain.GRAHAMYes.
          Norman smiles, then stands and goes on inside.
          Graham settles back into his chair, looks out at the world.GRAHAM (CONT'D)Not any more.135 EXT. COURTYARD/VERANDAH, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAWN 135Norman comes into the courtyard. Madge, sipping from a cup
          of chai, calls down from her verandah.MADGEHow was the night?NORMANRather special.
          He leaves. Madge just stares after him.136 EXT. STAIRCASE. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAWN 136Norman on the stairs to his room.
          He stops, catches his breath.137 EXT. GARDEN. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAWN 137Graham is watching a stunningly beautiful bird. A snow
          crane; white and magnificent. It's on the grass in front
          of him.
          Then it opens its huge wings, takes off. And flies up into
          the bright blue sky. It's an extraordinary sight.
          As Graham watches the snow crane swoop and dip, it appears
          suddenly to slow and stall, until it seems to hang in the
          air, almost motionless.138 EXT. ROOFTOP. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAWN 138Norman crosses the rooftop to his bedroom. He comes
          inside, sits on the bed.139 EXT. GARDEN, MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 139Graham is still sitting in the garden.92.EVELYN (O.S.)You're back.
          He doesn't turn round. Evelyn has come out to the garden.
          She goes over to him.EVELYN (CONT'D)It's been rather an extraordinary
          night all round. First tell me
          your news, and then -
          She breaks off.
          Graham is dead.139A EXT. COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 139AEVELYN (V.0.)Day 45. Of course it was
          inevitable. Put enough old

          them goes...

          and Jean are behind her. Opposite sits Manoj. Evelyn
          turns to look at him, and at Gaurika, Manoj's wife, who
          sits beside him.EVELYN (V.0.)We all know it'll happen, but few
          of us know when. Graham died of
          a heart attack, evidently not his
          first. So he had a better idea
          than most what was coming, he
          just neglected to tell us. His
          prerogative.142 EXT. LAKE - DAWN 142Three white vehicles are driving across a narrow causeway,
          which barely rises above the surface of the lake. They
          seem to be floating. Clouds of dust billow behind them.93.EVELYN (V.0.)There was talk of sending the
          body home, but Manoj felt he
          should have a Hindu burial. At
          the place they had visited
          together. Not a holy place.
          Although for them perhaps it was.143 EXT. FUNERAL PYRE, RUINS - DAY 143A ruined garden, surrounded by the waters of the lake,
          crumbling pillared porticoes and arches. What must once
          have been a royal retreat is now long abandoned and
          overgrown.
          Graham's friends stand watching the pyre, transfixed by the
          flames. Manoj, dressed in white, stands with Gaurika. He
          recites a Hindi prayer.EVELYN (V.0.)A body takes a long time to be
          consumed. Many hours for the
          mourners to remember their dead.
          The fire must be lit at dawn, and
          by sunset, there must be nothing
          left but ash.144 EXT. LAKESIDE - SUNSET 144Stripped to the waist, Manoj walks into the water, holding
          a bowl.EVELYN (V.0.)Where do our souls go? is that
          all of us that is left behind?
          Perhaps the most we can ask is
          that when we do shuffle off, we
          do so knowing that we were loved
          Manoj pours Graham onto the water. The ashes shim r and
          dance, caught in the gentle currents.145 EXT. SERVANT'S GARDEN. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 145Muriel and Anokhi are in the servants' garden. Young Wasim
          sits silently in the corner.MURIELSo there's a process, they call
          it pickling. I have no idea what
          it is, or how they do it, but
          whoever invented it was a smart
          man. But the real genius was the
          one who introduced an onion into
          the system. That I could never
          have thought of.94.Ajit looks at her, ready to translate.MURIEL (CONT'D)No, forget it.
          Muriel is looking out at the yard. She sees Mrs Kapoor,
          talking to some surveyors. They're mapping out the
          building.
          Mrs Kapoor sees Muriel watching her, comes over to them.MRS KAPOORMrs Donnelly, what are you doing
          here? You should not be here,
          talking with this one.MURIELI'm helping her clean. If these
          pots get any dirtier, you'll have
          to serve the food with
          penicillin.MRS KAPOORWe have other rooms. Go to one
          of them instead. While this is
          still a hotel.
          She turns back to the surveyors.MURIEL(TO AJIT)What's her problem? What's
          happening here?
          Ajit can't answer. But he knows a man who can.
          He points to Young Wasim.AJITHe can tell you.146 EXT. ROOFTOP BAR, BHARATPUR PALACE HOTEL. UDAIPUR - 146EVENINGA stunning view over the city. Madge is having a drink
          with Norman. Douglas is sitting on the wall, but keeps
          looking down towards the stairs.MADGEWhen someone dies, you think
          about your own life. And in my
          case, there is less of it in
          front of me than behind. And I
          don't want to grow older. I
          don't want to be condescended to,
          ignored and marginalised by
          society. To become peripheral to
          the action.(MORE)95.MADGE (coat' d)

          come up the stairs to go to her room. She's leaning against
          the stone baluster.DOUGLASI wondered where you'd been.
          Evelyn turns. Douglas is on the stairs above her.DOUGLAS (CONT'D)We're all up top, having a drink.EVELYNI went to see Gaurika. Manoj's
          wife. I wanted to ask her what
          she knew. And the answer was
          that she knew everything, that
          he'd loved another man, and
          always would. He told her when
          the marriage was arranged.(BEAT)They had no secrets from each
          other, none.
          Suddenly she's crying. Unable to stop.
          Douglas puts his arms around her, and holds her to him.EVELYN (CONT'D)And that's right, don't you see?
          That must be right. Because what
          is the point of a marriage in
          which nothing is shared?
          Her words hang in the air. They stand there for a moment.
          Jean has come out of her room, and stands there, watching
          them.JEANMrs Greenslade, might I have my
          husband back now?

          have embarrassed me. And Evelyn.JEANYou were already doing a
          perfectly good job of
          embarrassing yourself. Can you
          imagine how ghastly it's been for
          everyone to watch you mooning
          around after that simpering doe-

          advantage of her loneliness and -DOUGLASGod, can you hear yourself? Can

          terrible person you've become?
          Jean is stunned into silence.DOUGLAS (CONT'D)All you give out is this endless
          negativity, a refusal to see any
          kind of light and joy even when
          it's right in your face, and a
          desperate need to squash any sign
          of happiness in me or anyone else
          .. it's a wonder I don't fling
          myself at the first kind word or
          gesture that comes my way. But I
          don't. Out of some dried-out

          Norman. She picks up Madge's glass.MADGEAre you alright?EVELYNI just need some water.
          She drains the glass.MADGEThat was a gin and tonic.EVELYNYes. I know that now.MADGEWhat's happened?NORMANGood evening, the Ainslies.
          Douglas and Jean are approaching them.MADGEHow are you both?JEANWe're particularly well.
          Douglas, tell them our news.
          She looks to him, waits. He says nothing.
          So she turns, and smiles.JEAN (CONT'D)We're going home.150 EXT. EVELYN'S VERANDAH/KITCHEN. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 150Sonny is with his investor, Mr Maruthi. They emerge from
          the upper courtyard onto the terrace overlooking the back
          of the hotel.98.SONNYAnd so I would ask you to loosen
          the strings on your purse, Mr
          Maruthi, and to do it most
          rapidly. So that Phase Two
          Development of the Best Exotic
          Marigold Hotel can begin with
          immediate effect.
          Mr Maruthi looks down, sees Muriel. She's with Anokhi,
          Ajit, and Young Wasim.
          He calls down to her.MR MARUTHIMrs Donnelly, I believe.
          Sonny spots the danger, tries to lead Mr Maruthi away.SONNYAnd now if you would please be

          Sonny takes a moment to recover.SONNYYou see? Profound satisfaction.
          Such is the inevitable result of
          a prolonged stay at the Marigold
          Hotel.

          surveyors, who are still taking their measurements.MR MARUTHIWhat are those men doing?SONNY(Glancing back for a moment)

          confronting his mother.SONNYMummyji, what is going on here?MRS KAPOORI have spoken to your brothers.
          They want to sell the hotel.
          These men are here to value the
          building.SONNYThey are valuing the land. My
          brothers do not care about the
          building. They will knock it
          down.MRS KAPOORThey could just wait a month for
          it to fall down of its own
          accord.SONNYYou joke, Mummyji, but inside I
          know you are not laughing. You
          do not want to see this dream
          destroyed. Send these people
          away.MRS KAPOORNo, my son. It is too late.152 INT. SONNY'S OFFICE - NIGHT 152Mrs Kapoor is at the desk, going through the accounts.

          Is that why you must be cruel to
          me?MRS KAPOORYou think I am cruel?SONNYYou loved my father. And he
          loved this hotel.MRS KAPOOR(FIERCELY)Two mistakes. There will not be
          a third.(BEAT)Say goodbye to all this, Sonny.
          And come with me to Delhi. Your
          life will become easier.SONNYNot easier, Mummyji. Smaller.
          He leaves.
          Mrs Kapoor comes back to the desk, fiddling with some
          paperwork, discomfited.
          She turns to the doorway. Muriel is there, in her chair.MRS KAPOORMrs Donnelly. Can I help you?MURIELDepends. Do you know how to use
          a computer?MRS KAPOORI assume you are joking.MURIELMrs Ainslie said she had an
          address where I could get some
          things I need. Some biscuits.

          Her fingers fly across the keyboard.101.153 INT. TRAIN - NIGHT 153The train rattles its way through the night. Jean is
          chatting away, in a better mood than we've seen her for
          some time. Evelyn listens in silence.JEANThe whole thing is actually

          Jaydoesn't move.SONNY (CONT'D)Or you can give her a message.
          Sunaina is standing against the wall, unseen by Sonny,
          listening.SONNY (CONT'D)Tell her from me what I should
          have told her the day we met.
          What I will announce to anyone

          Sunaina speaks to Jay.SUNAINAIncluding your mother?JAY(TO SONNY)Including my mother?SUNAINAHis mother.110.JAY(TO SONNY)Your mother.SONNYI will tell every mother in the
          land.SUNAINA(TO JAY)What will you tell them?JAY(TO SONNY)What will you tell them?SONNYThe only thing that matters in
          this world. That I love you.
          And always will.(BEAT)And by you, I mean Sunaina, Jay,
          not you. Although if you are to
          be my brother-in-law, I hope we
          can become better friends.SUNAINAWhy is he only saying this now?JAY(TO SUNAINA)You ask him.SUNAINAWhy are you only saying this now?SONNYBecause, Sunaina, love of my
          life, no more will I believe that
          I am not worthy, for only by
          loving you as you deserve will I
          become so.
          On Sunaina's face as she hears this.173 EXT. STREET, CENTRAL JAIPUR - DAY 173The cacophonous sound of drumming: a small band of players
          are beating out a deafening, syncopated rhythm as the
          Ganeshi festival begins to unfold.
          Sonny is on his bike, Sunaina riding side-saddle on the
          back. They're speeding through the city.
          Sonny rockets through an arch way up a side street, is
          confronted by a huge traffic jam. The Ganeshi procession is
          bringing everything to a standstill.
          He does a U-turn, speeds off back the way they came.111.174 INT/EXT. TAXI/STREET - DAY 174Douglas and Jean are sitting in the traffic jam.DOUGLASIt's funny. They call it rush
          hour, but nothing actually moves.(BEAT)It's not that funny.(BEAT)Although I suppose it's all about
          context, isn't it? I mean -JEANDouglas?DOUGLASYes?JEANIf you say one more word, I'll
          kill you with my thumbs.174A EXT. COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 174AMuriel sits alone in the courtyard, under her awning.
          Then Carol and Norman appear from reception, followed by
          Mrs Kapoor. They cross towards the arch.MURIELWhere d'you think you're going?MADGEYou may well ask.
          Madge is sitting under the shade of a tree..NORMANWe're moving in together.MURIELAlready?CAROLThat point has been made.MRS KAPOORThe hotel is closing.MURIELDoesn't have to.
          Silence. Everyone stares at Muriel.
          She takes out the spreadsheets.112.MURIEL (CONT'D)I've been going over the
          accounts.174B EXT. STREET, CENTRAL JAIPUR - DAY 174BIf anything, the traffic is now worse. Jean and Douglas's
          taxi has progressed a few yards, and is now wedged into the
          arch. The Ganeshi procession is completely blocking the far
          entrance to the archway.
          Jean gets out, looks at the sea of unmoving traffic ahead
          and behind.JEANThis is ridiculous. It could go
          on for hours. There's no way
          we're ever going to get out of
          here.DOUGLASMaybe there is.
          A rickshaw arrives next to them, swerving through the
          traffic. It is ridden by IFTI.JEANYou. Can you get us to the
          airport?IFTISorry long way sore legs not
          possible.JEANI'll give you everything I have.IFTIStep right in mind your head

          How about if I give you something
          else? My watch?IFTI(TAKES IT)Sure. Thank you. Still not
          possible.DOUGLASWe'll get another flight. We can
          go back to the hotel, and leave
          in the morning.JEANNo.DOUGLASJean, you heard what he said. He
          can't do it.JEANHe can do one person, and cases.DOUGLASYes, butJEANCould fate find a better way to
          tell us what we need to hear?DOUGLASWhich is what?JEANThat it's over. It was over a
          long long time ago.DOUGLASThis is not the time to talk
          about this. Let's wait till weGET-JEANI have to go, Douglas.DOUGLASI won't let you.JEANNo, you'll want to come after me.
          Chase me to the airport and tell
          me everything will be fine.
          But please don't. Because the
          truth is we both deserve more
          than we've had. You're just too
          kind and too loyal to admit it.113A.Beat.JEAN (CONT'D)I will be alright.(SHE SMILES)I'm turning left.
          She climbs onto the rickshaw.114.As the drumming intensifies, Douglas stands holding his
          suitcase, watching her weave through the traffic and out of
          sight.174C EXT. STREET. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 174CSonny and Sunaina roar towards the hotel, drive into the
          gate and up the path...175 EXT. STREET/COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 175Mrs Kapoor is studying the spreadsheets.MRS KAPOORI don't know what any of these
          figures mean.
          Sonny and Sunaina drive into the courtyard, screech to a
          halt.
          They dismount.SONNYMummyji? MummyjitMRS KAPOORRight here, you do not need to
          shout.SONNYDo you remember what my father
          used to say? That nothing happens
          unless first we dream. Like him
          I have dreamt, Mummyji, and like
          him, I have failed. The Marigold
          Hotel is crumbling into dust.
          And it turns out I can live with
          that. But the one thing I will
          not do is live without this girl.
          To whom I did not introduce you
          properly before.(BEAT)This is Sunaina Shantanu Palawat.
          The woman I love, and wish to
          marry.SUNAINAI am very pleased to meet you,
          Mrs Kapoor.115.Sunaina puts out her hand. Mrs Kapoor will not take it.MRS KAPOOR(shaking her head)
          No. I forbid it. I forbid this
          match. Utterly and completely.
          Do you hear me, Sonny? This
          cannot happen.
          And then a low, rumbling sound comes from the corner. Like
          a quiet volcano.
          Young Wasim is speaking. It's a long, poetic and heartfelt
          speech.
          Unfortunately it's in Hindi.MADGEWhat is he saying?MURIELWhat he said to me, I imagine.
          She turns to Sunaina.MURIEL (CON'TD)Can you help?SUNAINAHe is saying . he is saying
          that he has been with this family
          as long as he can remember.
          Given them a lifetime of service.
          And that he remembers another
          fight, between two young people
          and their parents. And he
          remembers the moment where the
          young man stood up to his motherMRS KAPOOR. and said yes, I want to marry
          this woman. Yes, she is from a
          different community. But she is
          smart, she is beautiful, and I
          love her.
          Long pause.
          MRS KAPOOR (cont'd)
          I don't know who he's talking
          about.
          She offers Sunaina her hand.
          MRS KAPOOR (cont'd)
          Take care of my favourite son.
          Sunaina shakes her hand.116.NORMANSo I'm not clear now. Am I
          staying or going?MURIELDepends how you read the
          accounts.SONNYThe accounts?MURIELTurns out the original plan is
          good, it works. Just not in the
          hands of an imbecile.SONNYI knew that plan was good!MURIELWhat the place needs is more
          money.SONNYUnfortunately my investor, Mr

          Norman looks at Carol.NORMANI'd like to.117.CAROLIn the shack on the roof?NORMANI sleep in the trees.SONNY(TO CAROL)We have a double room. Bathroom
          ensuite. And a fully working

          He points to Graham's room.SONNY (CONT'D)A guest has recently checked out.
          Madge can't believe he just said that.CAROLI'll think about it.MURIEL(TO MADGE)Mrs Hardcastle ? You're staying.MADGEOn my own?MURIELYou're off your game. Lost your
          confidence, maybe. But you're a
          thoroughbred. You'll be back.
          Madge smiles.MURIEL (CON'TD)And what about you, Mrs
          Greenslade?
          Evelyn has come down, unnoticed by all. Except Muriel.EVELYNWhat about me, Mrs Donnelly?MURIELWe haven't talked much, you andI.EVELYNMy loss, evidently.(BEAT)I'm not sure what I should do.
          Nothing here has quite worked out
          as I hoped.117A.MURIELMost things don't. But sometimes
          what happens instead is the good
          stuff.(BEAT)(MORE)118.MURIEL (CONT'D)Haven't you got work in the
          morning?
          Evelyn nods.MURIEL (CONT'D)Besides, he'll be back.EVELYNYou don't know him. He's the
          most loyal man I've ever met.MURIEL50,000 rupees says I'm right. At
          your current salary that should
          take you three months to pay off.
          Muriel stands up. Everybody stares. She starts to walk
          slowly but proudly across the courtyard. She reaches the
          doorway, turns back.MURIELIf you'll excuse me, someone's
          waiting to help me make mango
          chutney. Why did no one tell me
          about that stuff?MRS KAPOORWho is the new assistant manager?MURIELWhy? Are you thinking of
          applying for the job?
          She gestures for her wheelchair.
          Sonny rushes up with it. She sinks down.MURIEL (CONT'D))That's enough exercise for one
          day.175A EXT. AIRPORT ROAD. JAIPUR - EVENING 175AJean sits in the rickshaw, surrounded by her luggage,

          Ganeshi drummers, silhouetted against the lights of the
          city.
          The sound fades as he disappears into the celebration, and
          is replaced by the gentle sound of temple bells, ringing
          for morning prayers.EVELYN (V.0.)We came here, and we tried. All
          of us, in our different ways.176 INT. EVELYN'S ROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 176Evelyn is still sitting, fully dressed in her room. She's
          been up all night.
          Her alarm clock buzzes. She turns it off.177 EXT. EVELYN'S TERRACE, MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 177Evelyn comes out of her room, walks across the terrace.178 EXT. COURTYARD, MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 178EVELYN (V.0.)Some achieved more than others.

          Evelyn walks through the courtyard, and on out of the
          hotel.179 EXT. GARDEN/PATHWAY, MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 179Evelyn walks down the path towards the street.
          Then Douglas comes through the gate, with his suitcase.
          They stand there, looking at each other for a moment.EVELYNGood morning.120.DOUGLASIt is, isn't it?EVELYNYou're still here.DOUGLASI missed the plane.EVELYNWhat about Jean?DOUGLASShe didn't.
          Beat.DOUGLAS (CONT'D)(putting down hisSUITCASE)I had quite an interesting night,
          actually. I met the same taxi
          driver, but this time I let him
          take me to his brother's hotel.
          Which turned out to be less of a
          hotel, and more of a brothel,
          really. They gave me this pipe,
          said it was apple tobacco, but
          that's not what we called it when
          I was a student. So I made my
          excuses and left, wanted some
          time to think. This city at
          night is extraordinary.(BEAT)Of course the apple tobacco
          helped.(BEAT)Guess what? I finally saw an
          elephant.

          She turns and walks away.

          playing because we grow old, we
          grow old because we stop playing.
          Douglas is haggling with a motorbike mechanic. He seems to
          be having more success with the price than in earlier days.180A EXT. ROOFTOP, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 180ACarol is lying on Norman's bed, reading a book, while he
          washes his socks in a bucket.EVELYN (V.0.) (CONT'D)All we really know about the

          Coming from the other direction, another motorbike, Douglas
          at the handlebars, returning Sonny's greeting.
          And on the pillion seat, riding side-saddle, her scarf
          flying in the breeze, is Evelyn, on her way home from work.
          EVELYN (V.0.) (cont'd)
