     FRENETIC. A HEAVY RAIN POURS DOWN on a MELEE OF ACTIVITY.

     POLICE CARS block either end, their LIGHTS ignite the sky in
     a dizzying RED and BLUE design. The attention centers on...

     The SUV and the CRASHED VEHICLE lay in the middle of the
     bridge. A MAN, 30's, madness on his face, his right hand
     holds a HOSTAGE, a woman, 20's, racked with fear, tight to
     his body. His left holds a GUN!

     Two DETECTIVES, slowly approach the Man.   ONLY SEE THEDETECTIVES FROM BEHIND.A News Reporter, KAREN CROSS, 30's, blond with energy to
     burn, shields herself from the rain, steps in front of the
     camera...KAREN CROSS... Police on scene are approaching
                the suspect. They're at the center of
                the Bridge now.

     DETECTIVE QUENTIN CONNERS, a grizzled, intense veteran. His
     charisma, which he has in spades, gets him into as much
     trouble as it gets him out of. At present a somber mood.
     The shadows from the rain stream down Conners's face.

     IN THE GLASS'S REFLECTION... The TV Report plays. (NOTE:
     most of, if not all, of the TV report will in reflection.)KAREN CROSS (OS)After a two month investigation, Det.
                Jason York has been relieved of duty

                shooting deaths of Lisa ReAnn and John
                Curtis. Key testimony against York
                came from Det. Bernard Callo, who was
                on scene that night. The Seattle
                Police Department is handing this case
                over to the King County District
                Attorney's office. Criminal charges
                are expected.3    ON A TELEVISION SCREEN--                                       3The IMAGE cuts to an earlier interview with... CAPTAIN

                women entrusted with serving and

                Simply put... Just because you are a
