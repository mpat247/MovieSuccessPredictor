          The air is filled with the sounds of a warm, summer night. A
          light comes on in a FARMHOUSE window. The door opens, a small
          dog and a young girl emerge.GIRLGo on now Paul, don't be long.

          The dog trots out across the property. It stops to scratch.
          The sounds of night cease. The dog stops scratching, sniffing
          the air, cocking its head, sensing something. We hear a low
          humming sounds. The dog looks up. We see a soft orange glow
          reflected in its eyes. The dog whimpers
          Back at the farmhouse, a deep, dull thud shakes the ground,
          bringing the small girl back out onto the veranda. An orange
          glow pulsates somewhere out in the darkness.GIRLPaul... Paul?
          The girl draws near, illuminated by the orange glow.GIRLPaul?!
          The glow fades again.
          MUSIC: "The Boy In The Bubble"� by Paul Simon.TITLE: PAULEXT. SAN DIEGO STREET. PRESENT - DAYGRAHAM WILLY (32) and CLIVE GOLLINGS (33) stand in the
          blazing San Diego sunshine, waiting to cross the road. GRAHAM
          is thin but his clothes seem too small. He has long greasy
          hair, buck teeth and thick glasses. CLIVE is bigger and wears
          a long black leather coat, Red Dwarf T-shirt and boots. His
          hair is densely curly and shaped like a pyramid.
          Four people dressed as BORG from Star Trek pass by. GRAHAM
          and CLIVE shrug derisively. The cross-walk beeps.
          As the music kicks in, GRAHAM and CLIVE set off across the
          road towards the San Diego Convention Centre. They make their
          way through a throng of costumed Comic-Con attendees.INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. CONVENTION FLOOR - LATERGRAHAM and CLIVE are at a fantasy weapons stand. CLIVE is
          brandishing a KATANA SWORD. He test the balance, the weight,
          the sharpness. He closes one eye and looks down the length of
          the blade. He nods appreciatively.2.CLIVEBeautiful piece.VENDERDamn straight. Practical
          performance. 100% Japanese, folded
          steel. Real hero shit.CLIVEHow much?VENDER$1,349.99.CLIVE nods, puts the sword down and walks away.GRAHAMAren't you gonna get it?CLIVENo, it's rubbish.INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - DAYWe see them on an escalator, walking down a wide corridor,
          passing people in a variety of costumes. Finally, they join a
          line of people waiting to meet the actor, MICHAEL BIEHN.GRAHAMWhat are you going to ask?CLIVEDo you feel that the killing of
          Hicks and Newt in Alien 3,
          invalidates Ripley's struggle at
          the closed of the previous
          installment?GRAHAMI was going to ask that!CLIVE(IN KLINGON)Tough tits four eyes.SECURITYAlright, next!
          Suddenly nervous, GRAHAM approaches. MICHAEL BIEHN is signing
          pictures. He is pleasant, if business like.MICHAEL BIEHNHey there. Who's it to?GRAHAMGraham.3.MICHAEL BIEHNGraham.GRAHAMUh... are you... did you?MICHAEL BIEHNThere you go.

          SECURITY moves CLIVE on. CLIVE scrambles for his camera.CLIVEI... I need to photograph him.SECURITYYou can take it from there.
          CLIVE and GRAHAM huddle together and try to position
          themselves with MICHAEL BIEHN in the background. CLIVE takes
          the shot. We see a frozen image of CLIVE and GRAHAM, with
          MICHAEL BIEHN barely visible in the background. The pair move
          off, looking at their spoils.GRAHAM/CLIVE(HIGH FIVING)YES!GRAHAMThat was amazing. I was actually a
          bit nervous.CLIVEReally? I wasn't.GRAHAMGood egg, wasn't he?CLIVEYes, very unaffected. Damn, I
          forgot to give him my card.

          On either side of them are stacks of their new book; JELVA -
          ALIEN QUEEN OF THE VARVAK. A banner hangs behind, displaying
          the tome's cover, a muscular green woman in a gold bikini
          rides a blue rhino. She lashes at the beast with a laser
          whip. She has three tits. A lanky publicist paces up and
          down, making sure everything is in order.PUBLICISTLooks good, right?CLIVEYes, it's very impressive.PUBLICISTIt really does the image justice. I
          never noticed the third tit.CLIVEThat was Graham's idea.PUBLICISTLadies man, huh? You guys happy?

          have a great story and as usual
          your renderings jump from the page.PUBLICISTYeah man. Three tits. Awesome.GRAHAMThank you.CLIVEAll we have to do now is sit back
          and enjoy.

          They are sat in exactly the same position as before. CLIVE
          looks a little downbeat, GRAHAM fidgets with his pens.PUBLICISTOkay, that's the hour. How'd we do?CLIVEThree copies.PUBLICISTHey, one for each tit. Maybe you
          should have given her four.GRAHAMThat's sick.PUBLICISTDon't sweat it. It's a sleeper.CLIVEYeah, but three copies?PUBLICISTBetter than Carl Weathers.CLIVEYES!GRAHAMWould you like a copy?PUBLICISTAre you nuts? My office is full of
          junk.
          The PUBLICIST walks away chuckling.CLIVEGraham, I need a drink.INT. HOTEL. BAR - NIGHTGRAHAM and CLIVE are stood against the wall in a bar. GRAHAM
          drinks and elaborate blue cocktail through a straw. CLIVE
          sips from a Jack Daniels and Coke. Everyone else in the bar
          is dressed as a HOBBIT. CLIVE winks at a girl.7.INT. HOTEL. BEDROOM - NIGHTGRAHAM and CLIVE's hotel room is filled with bags of stuff
          from the convention, a laptop computer and a games console
          plugged into the TV. GRAHAM lies on his bed. He is looking at
          a map. Other maps are scattered about.CLIVE (O.S.)It was like the Prancing Pony in
          there.GRAHAMNasty Hobbitses.
          CLIVE emerges from the bathroom. He is naked but for a black
          towel wrapped around his waist. His hair is wet and suddenly
          incredibly long. Around his neck, a large animal tooth hangs
          on a black leather cord.CLIVEThey think they're so cool.GRAHAMHey, are you excited about going to
          Area 51?CLIVEHell yes.GRAHAM06.30 check out?CLIVEA-ffirmative.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE both look at their watches.CLIVEThree, two, one...GRAHAM CLIVEBeep. Beep.CLIVEGood night, Graham.GRAHAMGood night, Clive.
          They switch off their respective bedside lights. The room is
          plunged into pitch darkness. A few seconds pass.GRAHAMAre you asleep?CLIVENo.8.GRAHAMShall we try and storm the Citadel
          before we nod off?CLIVECouldn't hurt could it?
          We hear some movement then the room is illuminated by the TV.
          The boys lie on their beds holding games controllers.CLIVECover me.INT. HOTEL. RECEPTION - MORNINGGRAHAM and CLIVE stand at reception. Both look extremely
          sleepy. CLIVE's eyes close. GRAHAM lolls forward onto the
          reception desk. His head hits the bell.DING!EXT. HOTEL - MORNINGThe boys stand, waiting for their transport. We see them from
          across the road. A tiny old car splutters up to the curb. A
          valet gets out and hands the keys to CLIVE.VALETThere you go.GRAHAMThat's not ours.VALETNo?CLIVENo, that's ours.
          A large RV pulls up. A 1985 Holiday Rambler, Imperial. Top of
          the range in its day. Still looks good.VALETOh.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE run off toward the RV. The four BORG from
          the previous day approach the VALET and exchange the key to
          the car for some small change. The BORG drive off.VALETFucking Borg.
          (giving the finger)
          Assimilate this!
          The RV speeds past the disgruntled VALET. GRAHAM and CLIVE
          can be heard whooping within.9.INT. RV - MORNINGCLIVE is seated behind the wheel of their RV, he now wears
          black wrap-around shades. In the back of the RV, GRAHAM
          fusses with maps and provisions.GRAHAMBreakfast?CLIVEJava. Straight up.GRAHAMAny solids?CLIVENo, let's punch through. Miles make
          the eggs taste sweeter.GRAHAMI love eggs!CLIVEI hear that. Now, get that "�Joe' on
          the go and jump in the Chewie seat.
          I need your map skills.GRAHAMGood job I pre-pared.
          GRAHAM flicks on the coffee and jumps into the co-pilot's
          (Chewie) seat.GRAHAMIt's a shame I don't have some
          controls on this side. That way, I
          could take over if you needed the
          loo.CLIVEYeah, I could say "take the helm."�GRAHAM"Take the helm, number one."�CLIVEYeah, "take the helm, number one, I
          need a number two."�
          They laugh heartily. Through this, GRAHAM has been taking out
          his laptop and setting it up on the dash board.GRAHAM"�Least I've got Cerebro, eh?10.CLIVEAbsolutely. Real-time sat-nav multi
          map and advanced geo-tagging with
          continual info stream?GRAHAMImpressive.CLIVEMost impressive.GRAHAMAnd let's not forget, we've always
          got Analogue.
          GRAHAM pulls a map down. Obscuring the entire windshield.CLIVENot when we're driving Graham.GRAHAMSorry.
          GRAHAM sends the map back up into the roller. The coffee
          percolator gurgles in the galley.GRAHAMSounds like coffee o'clock.CLIVEThank god. I'm a wreck until I've
          had my first cup of J.
          GRAHAM high fives CLIVE and heads back into the kitchen.INT. DINER - DAYGRAHAM and CLIVE eat lunch. GRAHAM has finished a plate of
          prawns. He inspects the shells.GRAHAMLooks like a pile of dead droids.
          A perky waitress approaches. GRAHAM and CLIVE become shy and
          awkward.WAITRESSYou boys all set? Can I get you
          anything else?
          GRAHAM spills his drink. CLIVE appears very uneasy.INT/EXT. RV - DAYThey drive in silence, surveying the landscape.11.CLIVEAmazing, isn't it? There are
          295,734,134 people in this country
          and we haven't seen a soul for a
          hundred miles. Where is everybody?GRAHAMWhat about that old woman on
          crutches we saw hitchhiking?CLIVEApart from her. I suppose that's
          why they established the Dreamland
          facility out here.GRAHAMFar from prying eyes.CLIVEDid you know the site was selected
          in the mid-1950s for testing of the
          U-2 spyplane, due to its
          remoteness, proximity to existing
          facilities and presence of a dry
          lake bad for landings?GRAHAMYes.CLIVEOh.GRAHAMShall we have a bite before or
          after we hit the Black Mailbox?CLIVEBefore.INT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. BAR - EVENINGGRAHAM and CLIVE tuck into burgers. They are the only
          customers. The interior is replete with various Area 51
          related memorabilia. PAT, (female, 50s) the proprietor,
          speaks to them from behind the counter. She holds up two
          bumper stickers.PAT"Watch The Skies"� or "Alien
          Onboard?"�
          GRAHAM and CLIVE look at each other for a few seconds before
          looking back at PAT.GRAHAM/CLIVE"Alien Onboard."�12.PATNice choice. So, where have you
          boys come from?GRAHAM(MUMBLY)San Diego.PATComic-Con?CLIVEHow could you tell?
          We see GRAHAM and CLIVE looking back at PAT. They look like
          the most painfully obvious Comic-Con attendees ever.PATJust a guess. My nephew launched a
          comic down there a couple of years
          ago. Sort of dramatized the
          accounts of some of the folk we've
          had in here.CLIVEEncounter Briefs?PATThat's it. You heard of it, huh?CLIVEI've got all six.PATWell whaddya know? Small world.CLIVEDo you get a lot of UFO types round
          here?
          We see PAT looking back at CLIVE, surrounded by UFO and alien
          paraphernalia, a slight smile on her face.PATSome.GRAHAMHave you ever seen one?PATA UFO? Oh, I've seen plenty.GRAHAMReally?! You've seen more than one
          UFOs?13.PATWell, I don't know what they were.
          So as far as I'm concerned they're
          unidentified and they were
          definitely flying.CLIVEAnd objects.PATDamn straight. Whether or not they
          were spaceships, I can't say.
          Probably not, but I'd like to think
          they were. Be a shame if we were
          the only souls in the universe.CLIVEDid you now, it's estimated that
          there are as many as 200 billion
          galaxies in the observable universe
          and each of those has approximately
          40 billion starts, around which
          orbit countless planets and moons?PATYes.CLIVEOh.PATMakes you think though, don't it?CLIVEWhat?PATWhere is everybody?
          GRAHAM and CLIVE ponder this.PATYou boys all set?CLIVEI'd like a cup of coffee please.PATSure thing. How about you, sugar?GRAHAMCan I have an E.T. malt please?PATYou wanna sparkler in that?
          GRAHAM smiles coyly.14.PATI'll take that as a yes.
          She beams at the boys and disappears into the kitchen. GRAHAM
          and CLIVE are left alone. They take it all in.CLIVEIt's nice here, isn't it?GRAHAMAbsolutely.CLIVEI think I might use the loo.
          CLIVE walks through a door marked "�Maliens'. The adjacent
          toilet door (GUS and JAKE) enter. GRAHAM becomes uneasy.PATYes dear, what can I get you?JAKETwo beers.PATComing right up.INT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. TOILET - EVENINGCLIVE washes his hands. He pumps soap from a dispenser which
          is shaped like an alien's head, the soap squirts out of its
          mouth. CLIVE is quite taken with this.CLIVEThat is absolutely amazing!INT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. BAR - EVENINGCLIVE appears out of the toilet with his hands in the air.CLIVEHey Graham, an alien just sicked up
          into my palms.
          CLIVE doesn't see the two men sat up at the counter. He
          strides over to GRAHAM, full of excitement.CLIVEI'm joking, of course. They have a
          soap dispenser, shaped like an
          alien's head. When you pump his
          jaw, soap comes out of his mouth.GRAHAM(MUMBLING)Clive...15.CLIVEIt's hilarious.
          GRAHAM flicks his eyes to the counter.CLIVEWhat?
          CLIVE looks over and sees the two men. They are glaring back.
          CLIVE immediately loses his confident air.PAT (O.S.)Here it comes!
          GRAHAM closes his yes, remembering what he ordered. The two
          men turn to see PAT emerge from the kitchen with a tray of
          drinks. Two bottles of beer, one cup of coffee and an absurd
          looking milkshake in a tall glass with a sparkler.PATOkay then, beers for you gentleman.
          A cup of Joe and a extra thick malt
          with a sparkler for the boys from
          outer space.
          The man snigger derisively. PAT senses the tension.PATSo, where you boys headed?JAKEWe're heading into Utah. Do
          ourselves some hunting.GUSDeer, coon, beaver, whatever steps
          in front of the bangstick, right

          They throw a look back at GRAHAM and CLIVE.JAKEYou got that right, Gus.PATWell now, I heard Utah beaver puts
          up quite a fight.GUSThat's what we're counting on.
          They nudge each other and laugh.PATI better make you something good
          and hot. Long way to The Beehive.
          PAT give GRAHAM and CLIVE a look. CLIVE understands and
          fumbles for hi wallet.16.He places a number of bills on the table. They leave. GRAHAM
          comes back in and retrieves the bumper sticker. PAT gives him
          a wink. He leaves.INT/EXT. RV - EVENINGGRAHAM boards the RV. CLIVE is in the driver's seat. The

          they?GRAHAMDefinitely didn't speak Bocci.

          They scan the roadside for a few seconds.CLIVEI've found it.GRAHAMWhere?17.CLIVETHERE!!!EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHTThe RV comes to a screeching halt. It sits in the road for a
          moment, before it trundles onto the hard shoulder. The door
          opens, GRAHAM and CLIVE appear wearing head mounted torches.
          They wander over to a WHITE mailbox.GRAHAM/CLIVE(REVERENTIALLY)The Black Mailbox.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE marvel at it. The silence of the night and
          the size of the landscape dawns on them. They look up.CLIVEIt's amazing, isn't it? We're

          sort of stops in the air and hovers
          then just goes up really fast.
          Whoosh.18.GRAHAMWhat would you do if they actually
          landed?CLIVEKeep it together. First contact is
          a big responsibility. They come in
          peace, we go to pieces? That's not
          how I roll.
          CLIVE looks at GRAHAM who is staring off, wide eyed.CLIVEWhat's wrong?
          GRAHAM points off into the distance. HEADLIGHTS.GRAHAMIt's them. They found us. I don't
          know how but they found us.CLIVEWho? Who's found us?GRAHAMThe Libyans!CLIVERun for it Marty!
          GRAHAM and CLIVE scramble for the RV.INT. RV - NIGHTCLIVE drives, GRAHAM looks nervous. In the dashboard of the
          RV is a rear view monitor. They look at it intently.GRAHAMPerhaps it's not them. Perhaps
          whoever it was turned doff.CLIVEOf course it's them. We're dead.
          It's like Deliverance. They're
          going to rape us and break our
          arms.GRAHAMI don't want my arms broken!CLIVEThere's only one thing for it.GRAHAMWhat?CLIVEI'm gonna have to fly blind.19.CLIVE kills the headlights. They are plunged into darkness,
          still travelling at 65mph. The headlights come back on.CLIVEProbably best not to do that. I
          couldn't really see anything.
          They stare at the monitor. Suddenly, creeping up the rear of
          the RV, headlights. The front of a car becomes visible.CLIVEOh God, oh God, oh God.GRAHAMI need the toilet.CLIVEMe too.
          The vehicle behind pulls out to overtake.CLIVEThey're trying to overtake.GRAHAMDon't let them get past.CLIVEShould I ram them?GRAHAMWhat about the deposit?
          CLIVE gingerly jerks the wheel, causing the RV to swerve. A
          BLACK SEDAN car appears next to them, manoeuvering wildly to
          avoid the RV. GRAHAM and CLIVE stare in horror, their eyes
          widen as the car flips over and tumbles several times,
          bouncing across the asphalt and sliding to a smoking stop on
          its roof. GRAHAM's mouth hangs open. CLIVE blinks.CLIVEIt wasn't them.
          The RV pulls up to the crashed vehicle and stops. GRAHAM and
          CLIVE peer out of the window.CLIVEWe should see if they're okay.GRAHAMI still need a wee.CLIVEI can hold mine.
          GRAHAM goes to the back of the RV and into the toilet. CLIVE
          remains int he driving seat, staring out at the mangled
          Sedan. The toilet flushes and GRAHAM reappears.20.GRAHAMThe bulb's gone in there.EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHTGRAHAM and CLIVE step out of the RV and approach the car.
          Inside are three unconscious men. One door is open.CLIVEHello?
          They wait for a few seconds. Nothing.GRAHAMMaybe you should call for help.
          GRAHAM pulls out a cell phone and starts to dial.VOICE (O.S.)I wouldn't do that if I were you.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE spin round to see an indistinct figure
          sitting on a rock in the nearby darkness. The glow of a
          cigarette briefly lights up what appear to be two large,
          black eyes. GRAHAM and CLIVE gawp.CLIVEI rather think these men need help.
          Graham, give me the phone.
          GRAHAM passes the phone over.VOICESeriously, I wouldn't do that.
          GRAHAM's mouth falls open, CLIVE continues to hold the phone
          to his ear. We hear the operator.OPERATOR911 Emergency. How may I direct
          your call? Hello? Hello?
          GRAHAM and CLIVE continue to gawp. The shape stand and steps
          into the light. GRAHAM and CLIVE go slack. Standing in front
          of them, clad only in cut-off short and flip-flops... is anALIEN.ALIENPut - the phone - down.
          Without the slightest change of expression CLIVE rocks
          backwards in a dead faint. He hits the ground with a bump.
          GRAHAM looks at CLIVE then back at the ALIEN. When GRAHAM
          speaks his voice quivers with hysterical panic.GRAHAMWhat have you done to him?21.ALIENI didn't do anything. He fainted.GRAHAMYes but you made him faint.ALIENI did not. Okay I did, but it's not
          like i set my phaser to "�Faint'.GRAHAMYou've got a phaser!?ALIENNo! Look, I need you to help. Can
          you get this guy back onto your
          wagon?GRAHAMAre you going to probe us?ALIENNo! Where does that come from? Why
          do people always assume we want to
          stick something up their ass?GRAHAMDon't you?ALIENNo. There's certainly nothing about
          it in the encounter manual. As a
          rule, we don't even abduct. Maybe
          people find it easier to deal with
          earthly transgressions if they
          suppress it with absurd fantasies
          about alien probing.GRAHAMWhat?ALIENIt's just a theory. Listen, focus
          okay? I promise you I won't hurt
          you, I just need your help.GRAHAMYou need my help?ALIENYes.GRAHAMHow come I can understand you? Are
          you using some sort of neural
          language router?22.ALIENNo, I'm speaking English you prick.
          (off GRAHAM's expression)
          Sorry, I'm tense. Look, what's your
          name?GRAHAMGraham Willy.ALIENWhat about him?GRAHAMThat's the writer, Clive Gollings.ALIENWell, let's get Clive into the RV
          and get going. I'll explain
          everything on the way. Please.GRAHAMWhere are we going?ALIENNorth.GRAHAMThe RV's gotta be back in 2 days.ALIENWell, then we're gonna have to
          hustle, aren't we?GRAHAMBUT-ALIENLook Graham, you're just gonna have
          to trust me, okay?
          GRAHAM looks at the ALIEN. It stands at roughly 3 feet tall.
          His black almond shaped eye glint. His large head tilts to
          one side, his small mouth opens slightly, his long fingers
          clasp together, pleading.ALIENPlease man, I need you.
          GRAHAM considers the ALIEN for a moment.GRAHAMOkay then.ALIENGreat. Thank you.GRAHAMWhat's your name?23.ALIENI'm Paul.GRAHAMPaul?PAULYeah. Now let's get Cloverfield
          onto the recreational vehicle and
          get the fuck off MacArthur's Black
          Mile.
          They attempt to move CLIVE. PAUL senses something.PAUL (CONT'D)Oh man, has he...?GRAHAMI told him he should have gone.PAULCould have been worse. Know what
          I'm saying?
          They drag him into the RV. The door shuts, a few seconds
          later, GRAHAM appears and runs round to the back of the RV.
          He rips the bumper sticker off and gets back on board. The RV
          starts up and drives off.INT/EXT. RV - NIGHTGRAHAM drives, agitated. He looks behind him a couple of
          times. PAUL is hunting around in the fridge.PAULCan I have this ham?GRAHAMUh... yes.PAULGreat!
          PAUL starts to dangle strips of sandwich ham into his mouth,
          wolfing it down hungrily.GRAHAMPaul? Where am I going again?PAULI told you, North. Do you have a
          map?
          GRAHAM pulls the map. It obscures the wind shield.PAULNot when we're driving, Graham.24.The map disappears back up into the roller.GRAHAMSorry.PAULJust head North. We need to get as
          much distance as we can between us
          and them.GRAHAMThem? Who's them?EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHTWe hear the noise of engines, then boots on concrete as a
          dozen soldiers rush the area, attending the crash. A suited
          man gets out of a Sedan car. We don't see his face at first.
          The shot remains at his hip. He reaches into his pocket and
          pulls out a Twinkie. He unwraps it and brings it up to his
          mouth. We follow and see his face for the first time.
          Chiselled, focused, confident. This is SPECIAL AGENT ZOIL. A
          SOLDIER approaches.CAPTAINSir?ZOILTalk to me.CAPTAINThree survivors, company men, hurt
          but alive.ZOILAnyone else?CAPTAINNo sir.
          ZOIL looks into the sky and breathes in the night air.CAPTAINWhat's this?
          The CAPTAIN motions to a patch of moisture near his feet.
          ZOIL touches the wet patch and licks his finger.CAPTAINWhat is it sir? Brake fluid? Gas?ZOILNo. It's neither of those things.
          He looks around, then notices tire tracks in the dust by the
          side of the road. ZOIL stands, full of purpose. He returns to
          his car and hits a button on the dash.25.VOICEWhat's the situation?ZOILWe have a guest who's left the
          hotel without paying, sir.VOICEDamn it! Do you think he's "�left'

          of a coincidence?ZOILHow so?VOICEI signed the red document this
          morning, Zoil. Don't you think it's
          odd that he chooses today to go

          on the inside.VOICEMaybe.ZOILWell he's definitely got someone on

          wrapped up before Letterman.26.EXT/INT. RV. NIGHT - A FEW HOURS LATERClose on the wheel. Pull out to reveal the RV.
          Inside, CLIVE's eyes open. From the bathroom, CLIVE can hear
          the sound of someone noisily emptying their bladder. He
          notices his jeans have been pegged up to dry. He leans out to
          see GRAHAM in the driving seat, then looks back at the
          bathroom door. The toilet flushes.
          CLIVE pretends to be asleep as the door opens. A pair of
          skinny grey legs in cut-off shorts pass the bunk.PAULThe bulb's gone in there.
          CLIVE gets up silently and wraps his black towel around his
          middle. He creeps toward the front of the RV. GRAHAM drives,
          PAUL sits in the Chewie seat eating pistachios.PAULI hate it when you get the closed
          ones, right?GRAHAMI usually bite them open.PAULAre you fucking insane? You gotta
          tap "�em and if they don't open you
          throw them away.GRAHAMThat's molluscs.PAULShut up.GRAHAMIt's true.(NOTICES CLIVE)Hello Clive! How are you feeling?CLIVEI'm feeling like I've gone MENTAL

          chatting to... to... that, like
          it's the most natural thing in the
          world. The two of you laughing away
          like you haven't seen each other
          since 1990.
          PAUL spits a shell out into a cup.27.CLIVE (CONT'D)So forgive me if I seem a little
          rattled but from where I'm standing
          it would appear you are trading nut
          knowledge with an alien life form.GRAHAMHis name is Paul.CLIVEOh, Paul is it? Paul what? Paul
          Verhoven? Paul Freeman? Paul
          Reiser?PAULJust Paul. You know, like Madonna
          or Dracula.GRAHAMPaul's from a small planet in the
          northern spiral arm of the

          travelled that distance?PAULWormhole.CLIVEBalls! Graham, this isn't what it
          seems. What about Ocham's Razor?GRAHAMThe hairdressers?CLIVEYes, the old man who owns it told
          me that, in unbelievable
          circumstances, the most plausible
          explanation is usually the truth.PAULAnd what's the most plausible
          explanation, Clive?CLIVEThat you're a thin midget in an
          alien costume.28.PAULThere's no such thing as a thin
          midget? Those guys are built. Have
          you not seen The Station Agent?GRAHAMHe's right. I think that's less
          believable than Paul being form a
          planet in the norther spiral arm of
          the Andromeda Galaxy.CLIVE (CONT'D)Oh really?
          With this CLIVE grabs at PAUL. He pulls at the alien's skin,
          trying to gain a hold of a mask.PAULOw! Get off me!CLIVEYou're not real. You're not real!GRAHAMExcuse me.PAULGet off me, you fucking psycho!GRAHAMEXCUSE ME!CLIVE releases PAUL and looks out of the RV to see the
          flashing lights of a road block. GRAHAM slows down.CLIVEOh shit!
          CLIVE looks round to discover that PAUL has vanished. GRAHAM
          pulls the RV onto the hard shoulder.CLIVEWhere's he gone?GRAHAMMaybe he beamed up.CLIVEAs if. We would have seen the
          classic shimmer and hum.GRAHAMGood point.BANG, BANG, BANG!GRAHAM and CLIVE look to the door. Both terrified.29.EXT. DESERT ROAD - NIGHTGRAHAM and CLIVE stand outside the RV being questioned by an
          AGENT dressed like ZOIL. We can hear noise and activity from
          the RV. Another AGENT is aboard the RV.AGENT 1Where you boys from? Australia?CLIVEBritain.AGENT 1Ah. G'day mate.
          The AGENT smiles. GRAHAM and CLIVE look terrified.AGENT 1Whatcha doin' in the US fellas?CLIVE/GRAHAMComic-con.AGENT 1You're a long way from San Diego.CLIVEWe were having a little drive.AGENT 1Is that right?AGENT 2 (O.S.)Hey Haggard?!HAGGARDYeah?

          CLIVE look embarrassed.HAGGARDOkay, you guys can go.CLIVEThank you. May I ask what you're
          searching for?HAGGARDOf course you may.
          There is a slight pause. GRAHAM and CLIVE board the RV.INT/EXT. RV - NIGHTGRAHAM and CLIVE pull away in silence. They are both confused
          and shaken.CLIVEWell, it's pretty obvious what
          happened there, isn't it?GRAHAMIs it?CLIVEYes, the government used some sort
          of neurotoxic paint on the Black
          Mailbox, which was white by the
          way, and it caused us to suffer a
          shared hallucination about an
          alien. I mean, it's what we've
          always wanted, isn't it?GRAHAMI suppose so.CLIVEThan that's what happened.
          PAUL materializes from thin air behind them.PAULWRONG!EXT. DESERT ROAD - NIGHTThe sound of screeching tires draws the attention of the two

          into the night.INT. RV - DAYBREAKCLIVE drives in silence. PAUL sits in the passenger seat
          eating nuts. Day is breaking over the horizon. GRAHAM snoozes
          on the sofa. PAUL offers CLIVE a nut.CLIVENo thank you.PAULYou sure? How about a cup of
          coffee?
          (sees he's tempted)
          Come on Hulk, I'll get you a nice
          cuppa J.
          PAUL goes back to the galley, flicking GRAHAM on the nose as
          he passes. GRAHAM wakes up with a start.PAULHey, look who's up!32.GRAHAMHello Paul.
          GRAHAM approaches CLIVE who ignores him.GRAHAMWhat's the matter?CLIVEGraham, there is a Grey in the
          galley, making me coffee.GRAHAMDid you want tea?CLIVENo, I don't want tea.GRAHAMTea's a bit weird in America, isn't
          it?CLIVENo, what's wried, Graham, is that
          we have picked up an extra
          terrestrial hitch hiker and you
          seem completely fine with it!GRAHAMHe needs our help, Clive.

          Thank you.

          sits in the Chewie seat. GRAHAM hangs back...PAULLook Clive, I'm gonna go out on a
          limb and say this is probably the
          weirdest thing that's ever happened
          to you. Am i right?
          CLIVE doesn't deny it.PAULAnd I appreciate the fact that I

          the nozzle back into the pump. He walks toward the checkout

          PAUL laughs.CLIVEWhy's everything so funny? They
          think we're Muslims.42.PAULThat's their excuse for everything.
          There are worse things you can be.
          We had a Muslim guy at the base.
          Systems analyst called Yusef. We
          used to do karaoke on Tuesday
          nights. You should'a heard him do

          GRAHAM bring the RV to a halt. Silence.EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAYThe door to the RV swings open, CLIVE and GRAHAM step out.
          The desert road is silent. We can see for miles. On the road

          PAUL looks at them, then scoops the bird up in his hands.GRAHAMWhat are you doing?
          PAUL closes his eyes. His skin ripples with color as he sways
          slightly. The bird's eyes flicker, its head lifts, it opens
          its beak and tweets. GRAHAM and CLIVE are astounded by what
          they are seeing.GRAHAMIt's a miracle!43.PAUL stuff the bird in his mouth with a grotesque crunch.PAULI'll miss these.CLIVEWhy would you do that?PAULI'm not gonna eat a dead bird, amI?EXT. GAS STATION - DAYZOIL and his men are parked on the forecourt of the gas

          GRAHAM head to the galley, ignoring PAUL, who jumps into the
          Chewie seat and stares at CLIVE.CLIVECan I help you?PAULYou want a cigarette?CLIVENo, thank you. I don't smoke.
          PAUL lights a cigarette, the smoke wafts into CLIVE's face.PAULLook, I'm sorry okay? About eating
          the bird.
          CLIVE continues to ignore PAUL. GRAHAM arrives with the
          coffee and a Honey Bun cake.GRAHAMHoney Bun?CLIVECould you unwrap it for me?GRAHAMBy your command.46.GRAHAM unwraps the cake and pops it into CLIVE's gob. PAUL

          PAUL does a very weird, very long charade, demonstrating
          various "�group' and "�one on one' homosexual practices.CLIVENo!PAULOkay, that's great. I just
          wondered. I'm cool with it.
          Everyone's "�bi' where I'm from.
          It's all about the pleasure thing,
          you know? We've evolved beyond
          paranoid notions of gender
          identity. I mean, procreation is
          only the functional aspect of
          sexual congress right? The human
          race is fairly advanced but most
          males still act like a cornered
          tiger if you imply the like
          "�smoking the bone' and let's face
          it they probably do. Look at single
          sex, empirical institutions,
          boarding schools, prisons, pirate
          ships, places where the choice has
          been removed, everyone's banging
          everyone else and there isn't a
          whiff of socio-cultural angst. Get
          out into the real world and guys
          are getting smacked int he chops
          for wearing pink socks. You think
          you're so sophisticated because you
          can distinguish yourself from your
          own reflection but ultimately
          you're part of a deeply neurotic
          species and you'd all be a lot
          better off if you stopped worrying
          and learned to love the bum.CLIVEWhat are you trying to say?PAULMaybe you should start smoking.47.INT. RV - EVENINGLater, the RV pulls up to gate at the front of an RV park.
          GRAHAM is now in the Chewie seat, PAUL stands behind,
          steadying himself on the backs of their chairs.CLIVEGreat find, Graham.GRAHAMI sourced a website listing off the
          beaten track, North American RV
          parks.PAULI really lucked out with you nerds,
          didn't I?
          GRAHAM and CLIVE look proud. CLIVE drives the RV over a speed
          hump into the park. PAUL loses his balance and falls over.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE laugh. They pull up to a gate.GRAHAMIt's awfully quiet.CLIVEJust the way we like it.
          PAUL scrambles to his feet, reaches across CLIVE and rest on
          the horn.HOOOOOOONNNNK!CLIVEStop doing that!GRAHAMSomeone's coming.
          PAUL shimmers and disappears. GRAHAM and CLIVE yelp.VOICEHello?CLIVE(quietly to Graham)

          GRAHAM opens the door. RUTH BEHE, a young woman in her mid-
          twenties stands outside. She is pretty but has no idea. She
          wears glasses, one eye of which is blacked out. GRAHAM stares
          at her. We hear the slide guitar moment from Olivia Newton
          John's "Hopelessly Devoted To You"�.RUTHGood evening, I'm Ruth Behe.CLIVEHello Ruth. Do you mind if we come
          in?RUTHSure. Park in Bay 9. The charge is

          and take your money in the morning.
          Have a pleasant night now, won't

          RUTH opens the gate to allow CLIVE to drive through. GRAHAM
          watches RUTH intently as they pass.CLIVEDoors to manual and cross check.
          Graham? Graham?GRAHAMHmmm?
          PAUL re-materializes next to GRAHAM and CLIVE.PAULBOO!EXT. RV PARK - NIGHTRUTH is walking back to a static mobile home. From the RV we
          hear GRAHAM and CLIVE yelp. RUTH furrows her brow, turns
          back, and goes inside.INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - NIGHTRUTH enters a static mobile home and heads for kitchenette.
          From the ad-joining room we hear the sound of someone using a
          police radio scanner. Garbled reports fade in and out. We
          perhaps even hear ZOIL's voice briefly amid the static.MOSES BEHE (O.S.)What took you so long?RUTHI was just talking.50.RUTH stirs a pot on the stove. She surreptitiously retrieves
          an atlas from a drawer an starts to read.MOSES BEHE (O.S.)You talk to much.RUTHSorry Papa.MOSES BEHE (O.S.)How long they staying?RUTHJust the night I thinkMOSES BEHE (O.S.)Hook ups?RUTHUh-huh.MOSES BEHE (O.S.)Where they headed?RUTHEast.MOSES BEHE (O.S.)Them California plates I saw?RUTHYes, but they're from London.MOSES BEHE (O.S.)London, Ohio?RUTHNo, London, England.MOSES BEHE (O.S.)Where?!RUTHEngland, Papa. It's in North
          Western Europe.
          The atlas is snatched out of RUTH's hands. Behind her stands
          the towering figure of MOSES BEHE. Almost as wide as he is
          tall, his eyes glitter with fury and menace.MOSES BEHEEurope? I'll give you Europe,
          missy. Now, get and make my supper.
          MOSES lumbers off with the atlas. RUTH looks dejected.51.EXT. RV PARK - LATERQUICK CUTS as GRAHAM and CLIVE hook up power and water to the
          RV and prepare a small BBQ.INT. RV - MOMENTS LATERThe door to the RV opens, GRAHAM and CLIVE jump in. PAUL

          PAUL gives CLIVE a "�see what I mean?' look.CLIVEI'll flame up the BBQ pit. Fire's
          my forte.
          CLIVE sparks up his lighter and waves it around looking
          mysterious. He then turns and jumps down all three steps and
          slams the door of the RV behind him.EXT. RV PARK - NIGHTCLIVE is squirting lighter fluid over a fire. He flicks his
          tongue out, summoning the flames higher. PAUL materializes
          nearby, making CLIVE jump. He composes himself.52.PAULHello Clive. From the squirting of

          Hendrix face. They laugh loudly.EXT. BEHE RESIDENCE - NIGHTRUTH watches through her window. GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL are
          on the other side of the RV. Nevertheless, RUTH can see three
          pairs of dancing legs underneath the vehicle, silhouetted
          against the campfire. She frowns.MOSES BEHE (O.S.)RUTH!RUTH backs away into the shadows.54.INT. RV - MORNINGIt is very early in the morning. PAUL is asleep on the sofa.
          There is a knock at the door. PAUL vanishes. GRAHAM and CLIVE
          emerge from the bedroom in dressing gowns.CLIVEWho is it?RUTH (O.S.)It's Ruth.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE look at each other nervously. CLIVE opens
          the door, as GRAHAM straightens his hair.RUTHGood morning.CLIVEGood morning.RUTHMay I come in?GRAHAMYes.
          CLIVE give GRAHAM a "�what the hell are you thinking?' Look as

          round the camp fire, right?CLIVEOh the other one. Um...PAULI'm in the can. I ate a closed
          mollusc.
          PAUL blows a massive raspberry to prove his point. GRAHAM and
          CLIVE look embarrassed. GRAHAM changes the subject.55.GRAHAMI like your shirt.
          The shirt has a picture of Jesus shooting Charles Darwin in
          the head. Underneath it reads, "Evolve this!"�RUTHThanks. I got it at my church.GRAHAMWhy would Jesus want to shoot
          Charles Darwin?RUTH(BRIGHTLY)Because of his theories. Are you
          men of God?GRAHAMWould you like a coffee?CLIVEI suppose we're men of science.GRAHAMCLIVE-RUTH narrow her eye.CLIVEIf we believe in anything it would
          be macro evolution. Cause and

          biological order from the maelstrom
          of physical and chemical chaos.
          RUTH looks scandalized.GRAHAMOr it could be God. You just don't
          know do you?RUTHGod created the earth in six days
          and on the seventh he rested.
          PAUL emits another huge raspberry from the toilet.CLIVEDid you know that the universe has
          been dated as being 13.5 billion
          years old an that the release of
          neutral hydrogen at the moment of

          RUTH approaches the toilet door, taking up her fight with the
          unseen third passenger. She bangs on the door. GRAHAM and
          CLIVE are bewildered by this sudden turn of events.RUTHExplain to me how something as
          complicated as the human eye simply
          comes into being.PAUL (O.S.)Oh, don't give me that old
          irreducible complexity crap-RUTHThey eye is comprised of three
          interacting parts. Remove any one
          of them and it ceases to exist. It
          has the precision and delicacy of a
          pocket watch and, when the good
          Lord permits, it works in perfect
          harmony with its environment.
          Something as functionally perfect
          as that doesn't just occur without
          the intervention of a guiding hand.PAUL (O.S.)But it didn't just occur did it? It
          is the culmination of millions of
          years of development across
          countless species.RUTHWhat are you talking about?PAUL (O.S.)Evolution baby.
          RUTH screams and bangs the door.RUTHIt'd design!57.PAUL (O.S.)If He designed it, why didn't He
          just make it one part and take the
          whole weekend off?RUTHNothing you can so or do can shake
          my belief, or faith in the sure and
          certain knowledge that God made
          Heaven and earth and created us all
          in His own image.PAULOh yeah?
          (stepping out of the toilet)
          Well then how do you explain me?
          RUTH's mouth hangs agape in a soundless scream, her eye rolls
          up, her hair turns white. She collapses.PAULAnd that's Jenga.CLIVEWhat did you do that for?PAULI didn't do anything, she fainted.CLIVEShe saw you!PAULOh come on. Who's gonna believe

          spies his quarry on the work-top. He checks the passport and
          finds CLIVE's absurd picture. He laughs.PAULHallelujah.MOSES BEHE (O.S.)Ruth, what in the Lord's name-

          appears, beckoning to PAUL. PAUL reaches the door, just as
          MOSES levels the gun at his target. PAUL leaps into GRAHAM's
          arms, disappearing inside the RV, as MOSES fires off a
          booming shot. The BEHE mailbox explodes into pieces, as the
          RV careens off out of the trailer park.INT. RV - DAYBlackness. RUTH wakes up. Panic in her eyes. CLIVE drives,

          RUTH starts to pray furiously.GRAHAMI'm so sorry it had to be this way
          Ruth. We're definitely not going to
          hurt you and we'll let you go as
          son as we can. We were just a
          little concerned that you might
          call the police.RUTHYou have been deceived. Deceived by
          an agent of Satan himself.PAUL (O.S.)You know I'm sitting right here?GRAHAMHe's not a demon Ruth, he's from
          another world and we're helping him
          get home. He's not evil. He's just
          very rude.RUTHHow can he be from another world?
          There is only one world. Our world,
          created by God the Father.

          better, my existence only disproves
          the notion of the Abrahamic, Judeo-
          Christian God, as well as all
          single earth theologies. Science
          still hasn't categorically rule out
          the notion of divinity, even though
          evolutionary biology suggest the
          non-existence of a creator by
          probability alone.60.RUTHHow could that possibly make me
          feel any better?PAULJesus Christ, I was just trying to

          is, just because there are other
          inhabited planets, it's not the end
          of the world.RUTHThis isn't happening! You're a
          hallucination. You're not real.
          You're a test. A test from God.PAULYou can't win can you?
          RUTH starts to pray furiously, speaking in tongues, making an
          awful noise.CLIVEI can't drive like this. We'll have
          to drop her off and take our
          chances.GRAHAMNo!PAULOh, for God's sake.
          PAUL walks over to RUTH and places his and across her
          forehead. He appear to go into a trance. RUTH's eyes roll up
          into her head. We see a lightening montage of images. The
          cosmos, the surface of a planet, others like PAUL, PAUL's
          ship crashing into the ground. The images speed up as PAUL
          telepathically send his knowledge into RUTH's mind. They
          collapse in a heap on the floor. PAUL sparks up a cigarette.GRAHAMWhat did you do to her?!PAULI broadened her horizons.GRAHAMCan you broaden mine?PAULNo, it's tiring.
          GRAHAM goes over to where PAUL is lying.61.GRAHAMOh please.PAULCome here then.
          PAUL puts his hand on GRAHAM's head. GRAHAM's eyes go all
          fluttery. We don't see the images this time. GRAHAM falls.CLIVEOh great! Everyone knows the
          secrets of the universe apart from

          on in Buffy before me because his
          mum had cable.PAULCan't I just tell you?CLIVENo spoilers!

          comes face to face with her father.MOSES BEHERUTH?!RUTHPAPA?!CLIVEGraham?MOSES BEHEI'm taking you home.RUTHI... I can't.MOSES BEHEDon't talk back to me, girl!RUTHPAPA I-A chair smashes across MOSES's head, knocking him out. Behind
          him, bloodied and angry are the two MEATHEADS.EXT. BAR. PARKING LOT - NIGHTCLIVE, GRAHAM and RUTH explode out of the bar and run toward
          the RV. The MEATHEADS crash out after them.RUTHWhat about Papa?!JAKEHey, we ain't finished with you.75.CLIVEGraham, take Ruth into the RV and
          lock the door. I don't want either
          of you to see this.
          CLIVE turns back to the MEATHEADS. BANG! CLIVE is struck in
          the face, he falls, nose bleeding.
          They turn to RUTH and GRAHAM, who back up against the RV. The
          MEATHEADS approach ominously. The RV door bursts open. PAUL
          stands silhouetted against the interior lights.PAULYo fucknuts!
          The MEATHEADS freeze. PAUL vanishes, then reappears a few
          feet from them, their eyes bulge.PAULSo, who wants to get probed first?
          The MEATHEADS swoon and simultaneously hit the deck.GRAHAMHa! Only one of us fainted!PAULTell me you got the food?
          CLIVE gets up and opens his coat revealing bags of food.
          Sirens wail in distance. RUTH turns white.RUTHIt's them.GRAHAMWho?RUTHIt wasn't my fault. They answered
          the phone. He knew all about us.CLIVEWho? Who are you talking about?PAULGet in the RV!
          SMASH CUT. The RV roars to life, backing up at speed into the
          MEATHEAD's vehicle. MOSES BEHE bursts out of the bar, just as
          the RV passes. RUTH sees him out of the window. MOSES locks
          eye with his daughter. He runs to his pick up but realises he
          doesn't have his keys. The RV tears off into the night,
          leaving MOSES BEHE bellowing with anger and the Lincoln
          Escalade, shiny, mean, fucked.76.INT. RV - NIGHTThe RV pulls off the road into a secluded lay-by. The gang
          sit in silence for a while.GRAHAMWas that your dad, Ruth?
          RUTH nods.CLIVEHe was so angry.RUTHHe's always angry.
          GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL all exchange looks.GRAHAMAre you alright, Ruth?
          RUTH nods, still distant.PAULI'm feeling pretty amped up. Anyone
          wanna take a walk?CLIVEI'm game.GRAHAMYou want to come for a walk, Ruth?RUTHThanks, but I think I'm going to
          turn in. It's been a long day what

          whole belief system called into
          question.PAULSorry about that.GRAHAMIt was amazing though, wasn't it?
          Remember when Paul said "�Yo
          fucknuts'? That was brilliant.PAULYou gotta talk the talk, right?CLIVEWhat about when I got smacked in
          the nose?77.PAULYeah yeah Snorlax, you're a real
          hero. Come on. Let's skedaddle. You
          want anything Ruth?RUTHNo, you go, I'll be fine. Here
          Clive.
          RUTH hands CLIVE her handkerchief. It is embroidered with the
          words "�JESUS SAVES'.CLIVEThank you.
          He mops his nose as they leave the RV. GRAHAM lingers.GRAHAMYou can sleep in my bunk if you'd
          like.
          She smiles at him. He goes to leave but turns back.GRAHAMI'd use a pen to push the tissues

          of a quiet town. Next door is a Western themed clothing
          store. PAUL looks in the window.PAULHey Graham. Check this out. What
          d'ya think?
          PAUL indicates to a small cowboy outfit, big enough for a
          child, displayed in the window.PAULI'd look pretty hot, right?GRAHAMSpace cowboy.PAULSteve Miller Band. I love that
          song. Speaking of midnight tokers,

          CLIVE comes out of the liquor store clutching bags of beer.CLIVELet's party!EXT. WOODS - NIGHTGRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL have made a camp fire in a woodland
          clearing on the other side of town. They sit round drinking
          beers and chatting. PAUL rolls a joint.GRAHAMSo why "�Paul'? It's not very, you
          know, alien.CLIVEIs it spelt like, P-'-a-w-l-l or
          something?PAULNo.GRAHAMP-o-o-u-r-l?PAULNo, it's Paul. Like Paul Newman or

          More laughter. Even PAUL. He lights his joint.GRAHAMYou look like a poster on a
          student's wall.PAULThat was my gag! "�Take me to your
          dealer' right? Yeah, that was mine.
          Never saw a dime.GRAHAMYou never answered my question. Why
          Paul? Who called you Paul?PAULThe little girl who found me when I
          crashed. It was terrible actually.
          I killed her dog. I didn't mean to!
          My ship sort of landed on it. When
          the military arrived I was
          delirious; I kept saying "Paul?
          Paul?"� It was the only English I
          knew, because I'd heard the little
          girl saying it over and over.
          Spooks thought it was my name.CLIVEShe called her dog Paul?PAULLeast it wasn't Mr. Muggles.GRAHAMWhat happened to the little girl?80.PAULWho knows? Never saw her again.
          Think about her everyday though.
          PAUL offers the joint round. CLIVE and GRAHAM decline. PAUL
          takes a deep drag. During the following exchange, GRAHAM,
          CLIVE and PAUL start to move simultaneously as though
          governed by some kind of psychic link.CLIVEIt's strange, isn't it? Ordinarily
          in this situation Graham and I
          would be looking up at the stars,
          wondering about life on other
          planets but we know now, don't we?
          It's a bit of an anti-climax.PAULThanks a bunch, Hurley.CLIVEI don't mean that in a bad way.
          They all scratch their noses.GRAHAMPaul, can I ask you something?PAULShoot.GRAHAMWhy are you in such a hurry to
          leave?PAULI've outlived my usefulness.CLIVEHow so?PAULThere's only so much knowledge I
          can share about the universe and
          quantum theory and how to make a
          really nice meatball sandwich. The
          only thing I have to offer them now
          are my abilities.GRAHAMSo?PAULSo the only way they're going to
          get hold of them is by obtaining
          some of somatic stem cells.81.GRAHAMSo what, do they take a swab from
          your cheek?PAULNegative.CLIVEStool?PAULSadly, not that simple.GRAHAMBlood?! Oh my god, I hate needles.PAULBelieve me, a needle would be a
          picnic compared to what they had in
          store for me.CLIVEI don't follow.PAULStem cells are multipotent.

          laboratory they would have to...GRAHAM/CLIVECut your brain out.PAULBingo! Fortunately, someone was
          kind enough to give me the heads
          up, if you'll pardon the pun. So,
          when they were transferring me to
          the medical facility and I noticed
          the bumper sticker on your RV, I
          figured you might be sympathetic
          types. I zapped the spooks, grabbed
          the wheel and took my chance.CLIVEI thought the crash was our fault.82.PAULWell it was, kinda.GRAHAMSo, you're saying if they catch
          you...
          PAUL draws his thumb across his neck. GRAHAM and CLIVE look
          at PAUL in horror. All three scratch their heads.PAULSo tell me, are you guys virgins or
          what?GRAHAM/CLIVENo.
          They all cough.PAULAlright then, Clive, when was the
          last time you got laid.CLIVEComic-Con 2005. Ewok chick.PAULThree years ago you had sex with a
          midget?CLIVEShe was an Ewok!

          small enough to fit inside an Ewok
          costume.CLIVEShe was a midget.PAULI can't believe you thought boning
          a space bear sounded less
          embarrassing than a person of short
          stature.CLIVEI know. I'm sorry.PAULWas it nice?CLIVEWONDERFUL83.PAULYou sly dog!
          PAUL rolls onto his back, clapping. GRAHAM snorts into his
          beer, laughing. CLIVE joins in. Before long, the three
          friends are rolling around in hysterics, utterly out of
          control. After about thirty seconds of this, they pass out.EXT. WOODS - MORNINGThe sun has just risen. GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL lie round the
          smoldering camp fire sleeping soundly. PAUL is very white.
          His eyes open. He looks around.PAULOh shit! Hey, wake up. Wake up. We
          fell asleep.CLIVEHow did that happen?PAULSorry, I get this thing when I get
          high. It's called "�projective
          empathy'. You feel what I feel.GRAHAMLike in E.T.?PAULExactly.CLIVEOh, thank God. For a second there I
          thought I'd got drunk on Lite beer.
          The guys gather their stuff and walk to the edge of the wood.
          Looking through the tree line they realize that the quiet
          town of last night has become very busy indeed.GRAHAMOh dear!PAULI can't walk through there.CLIVEHow are we going to get back?
          Close in on GRAHAM having the best idea of his life.EXT. TOWN - DAYGRAHAM and CLIVE walk down the busy main street, between them
          is PAUL. He is dressed in the little cowboy suit from the
          shop window, his hat pulled down low over his face.84.GRAHAMMaybe we should hold hands, so that
          we look like a family.PAULThat's great! Two grown men who
          look like sex offenders holding
          hands with a child cowboy.CLIVEYou could be a midget.PAULYou're obsessed with midgets!
          They continue on, trying to look as if nothing is strange.GRAHAMSeem to be working, Clive. Clive?
          GRAHAM notices that CLIVE is no longer with them. He looks
          back to see CLIVE, gawping thought the window of a COMIC
          SHOP, at a sword resembling the one they saw at Comic-Con.
          The tag reads "�Genuine "�BLADE' Katana'. $299.99.GRAHAMClive, no.
          CLIVE walks into the shop. GRAHAM and PAUL follow quickly
          behind. As they enter the COMIC SHOP, MOSES BEHE emerges from
          the adjacent Drug Store. He takes a couple of pain killers
          and flexes his sore shoulders. He wanders up the road,
          scanning the passers by.INT. COMIC SHOP - DAYGRAHAM approaches CLIVE who is at the counter.GRAHAMNow's not really the time, Sausage.CLIVEI must have it.GRAHAMIt's very cheap. Are you sure you

          RUTH pauses a second.RUTHYes, I'm alone.ZOILDo you mind taking a look at these
          pictures?
          ZOIL pulls out three pictures and hands them to RUTH. CCTV
          shots of GRAHAM and CLIVE at the gas station and MOSES's pic
          of RUTH, looking younger, with dark hair and no glasses.ZOILDo you recognise any of these
          people, Miss?

          ZOIL smiles and nods. He laves.INT. COMIC SHOP - MOMENTS LATERGRAHAM and CLIVE are at the counter. CLIVE is trying out the
          blade. PAUL, in cowboy guise browses the racks of comics. He
          picks one up. The cover features an alien that looks a lot
          like him. The comic is called "�Encounter Briefs: Tales From
          the Dreamland'. PAUL smiles and shakes his head. He suddenly
          realises he is being watched. Next to him is a child, (8)
          small enough to see under PAUL's hat. He is looking at the
          cover of the comic and back at PAUL.PAULHow's it going?CHILDIs that you?PAULNo.CHILDIt looks like you.PAULSuppose it does. What's your name?CHILDKeith Nash.PAULI'm Paul. Pleased to meet you.

          PAUL produces his M&Ms. He offers one to KEITH.KEITH NASHI am but I shouldn't.PAULStrangers with candy, right?KEITH NASHRight.PAULWell, we've got a lot in common. We
          both like comics and M&Ms. Guess
          that makes us pals.KEITH NASHGuess so.
          KEITH beams at PAUL and takes a few M&Ms. They turn their
          attention back to the racks of comics. PAUL pulls one out
          called "�G-Men'. On the cover it shows an agent, not unlike
          ZOIL, shooting an alien not unlike PAUL.PAULYou read this one?KEITH NASHNo.PAULIt's a good one. Take it. Go on.
          It's a gift.KEITH NASHThanks Paul.88.KEITH stuffs it down his trousers. PAUL laughs. We hear MRS.
          NASH calling from the street.KEITH NASHI gotta go.PAULCatch you later, Keith Nash.

          the entirely wrong direction.HAGGARDSouth. Toward New Mexico, huh?
          KEITH nods. HAGGARD stands, his mind racing. He looks
          meaningfully at O'REILLY not noticing the RV rumbling up the

          down and picks something up. It is Ruth's handkerchief, now
          stained with dirt and blood. He screws it into his shaking
          hand. An engine roars. He looks up to see the RV rumbling up
          the road. It turns onto the Eastbound Highway. MOSES' pick up
          is parked about 200 yards away. MOSES starts to lumber

          They scramble.ZOILOh, and Haggard? Don't go getting

          Guess that's not gonna happen,
          seeing as we're living in a
          gigantic godless universe, with no
          hope of salvation.PAULHey, I don't know categorically
          that it's godless. I just said
          "�probably'.RUTHOh, that's a relief.PAULLook, the way you're feeling now,
          that's why religion appeared in the
          first place. It's like existential
          Prozac. Imagine being five year
          sold and having no adults around to
          tell you why it snows or what trees
          are for. That's how it is for much
          of humanity. Faith is a night-
          light. It illuminates the scary
          corners, fills the gaps, makes the
          universe easier to comprehend.
          Thing is, it's okay not to know
          everything. I mean, who knows
          what's really out there? Did you

          that 13.5 Billion years ago and
          that's how the universe came to be?

          problem of who created the creator

          mad. They told me it was a meteor
          that squashed little Paul. Took me
          away and did tests they did, said
          it was for cosmic radiation. They
          said I was concussed,
          hallucinating, but I knew you were
          real. I pulled you from that
          spaceship myself. Sat with you till
          the men came and took you away. If

          would have seen you too. They kept

          understand but they filled his head
          with "�delayed this' and "�post-

          through the trees behind them.ZOILPAUL!PAULLorenzo?!
          PAUL spins round. We go into slow motion. ZOIL fires. The
          bullet explodes from the gun, straight at us. Angle on the
          bullet as it passes in ECU. The shot moves round behind the
          bullet to reveal PAUL, looking shocked. The bullet whizzes
          past him, slamming into one of the soldiers.
          ZOIL rolls, coming to rest on one knee. He fires a second
          shot into the leg of the other soldier who collapses. He
          leaves his gun at VOICE just as the PILOT bursts from the
          cockpit. The PILOT fires but misses ZOIL. ZOIL takes out his
          shoulder, spinning him off his feet. VOICE steps forward,
          holding a smoking gun.VOICEIt was you! You told him. I
          should've known.(MORE)112.VOICE (CONT'D)You've never made a mistake in your
          life. That's why I put you in
          charge of this fucking mission.ZOILHe's my friend! I've known him for
          twenty years. He introduced me to
          my wife damnit!VOICEYou stupid son of a bitch. In five
          years, you could have been where I
          am.ZOILI don't want to be where you are.VOICEToo bad, seeing as I'm the one
          hold'ng all the cards and when I
          say "cards"�, I of course mean big
          fucking gun.
          VOICE points his gun at PAUL.PAULHow'd you find me?VOICEIt was pretty easy once we got a
          fix on the geek-mobile. Wasn't hard
          to figure out where you were
          headed. You always did have a flare
          for the dramatic.
          PAUL nods, a sad smile creeping across his mouth.VOICELet's go.
          TARA stands in front of PAUL, then RUTH, then GRAHAM then
          CLIVE, who summons every ounce of bravery in his body.CLIVEHe's not going anywhere.VOICEBe honest with yourself, two
          scoops. What is it that you think
          you can possibly bring to the table
          at this stage in the game?
          CLIVE reaches beyond his back and produces his KATANA SWORD,
          he holds it like a proud Samurai.CLIVEBlind fury.
          The blade falls off.113.CLIVEBloody low grade Turkish alloy.VOICEStep aside, you fat nerd.CLIVE(IN KLINGON)Graham, his this man.
          CLIVE steps aside. GRAHAM slams his fist into the face of the
          unsuspecting VOICE. He staggers back but rallies quickly,
          blocking GRAHAM's second blow and delivering a heavy rebuke.
          RUTH leaps onto VOICE's back and starts pummeling his head.RUTHLeave him alone!
          VOICE hits out at RUTH. GRAHAM renews his attack.GRAHAMLeave her alone!
          VOICE throws them off and comes face to face with TARA.TARALeave them alone.
          WHAM! She whacks VOICE across the face with a large stick.TARAYou're not taking him away again.
          He staggers backwards and falls to the ground, unconscious.PAULThank you, Tara.TARADon't mention it.
          PAUL rushes to ZOIL who lies on the ground, wounded.ZOILThe things I do for you, huh?PAULYou know I appreciate it.ZOILDo you have any idea how difficult
          it was to catch you guys?PAUL(LAUGHS)Let me take a look at that. Ruth,
          shine the torch down here?
          RUTH grabs a torch and steps in behind PAUL.114.BLAM! RUTH lurches forward, suddenly limp. Everyone turns to
          see MOSES BEHE, shotgun smoking in his and. His face white,
          his eyes wide.MOSES BEHEOh Lord, Ruth. My little Ruth.GRAHAMNoooooooooo!
          GRAHAM gathers RUTH up in his arms. She coughs, flecks of
          blood around her mouth.MOSES BEHEI...I never meant to shoot her. I
          was aiming for the goblin.CLIVEHe's not a goblin he's from another
          planet.MOSES BEHEBut he can't be. He... he...GRAHAMHe's an alien you stupid man! Oh
          Ruth, Ruth I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
          I should have never persuaded you
          to come with us.
          RUTH focuses on GRAHAM. She smiles, weakly.RUTHWhat, and miss all this? Graham,
          I've lived more in the last 48
          hours that I ever did in that
          trailer park. Isn't that what you
          said living was all about? Right
          now? This conversation? That tree?
          My next cheeseburger? I'm not
          afraid anymore Graham. I'm cold
          though. Hey, where is everybody?
          RUTH shudders and dies. TARA and ZOIL look aghast. GRAHAM
          buries his head in RUTH's hair. CLIVE, his eyes are filled
          with tears, puts his and on GRAHAM's shoulder.MOSES BEHEWhat have I done? I'm sorry. I'm so
          sorry.
          A shadow is cast across RUTH. Everyone looks up to see PAUL,
          silhouetted against the moon. His eyes glint.PAULThere is no way this thing isn't
          gonna end happy.115.PAUL drops to his knee and places his hands on RUTH's chest.
          MOSES drops his shotgun and lumbers over, distraught.MOSES BEHEGet away from her! Don't you touch
          my little girl.
          CLIVE holds out a hand to stop MOSES. He obeys. The air hums,
          charged with static. PAUL's skin ripples with color. Everyone
          watches transfixed. RUTH's eye flickers and opens. With some
          difficulty, she sits up and takes off her glasses. She blinks
          both shining, healthy eyes.GRAHAMRuth, are you okay?RUTHI think so. Is anyone hungry? I
          really feel like a cheese burger.
          Relief and joy spreads through group. MOSES falls to his
          knees and sobs. He feels a hand on his shoulder and looks up
          to see PAUL.MOSES BEHEThank you.
          RUTH and GRAHAM hug. She smiles at him.RUTHYou can kiss me now.
          They kiss with awkward passion. Everyone smiles then after a
          bit become uncomfortable and a bit grossed out.PAULLooks like the geek shall inherit
          the earth.CLICK CLICK.The group turn to see VOICE, upright, pointing his gun.VOICEI wouldn't say-SPLAT.A large spaceship lands hard on top of VOICE. Everyone looks
          shocked. PAUL, GRAHAM and CLIVE exchange a look.PAULHappens to the best of us.EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. CLEARING - NIGHTSome time has passed, a number of PAUL style aliens are now
          present.116.One of them uses a big hose to clean the remains of VOICE
          from the hull of the ship. Another two help the now healed
          soldier to their feet, patting them on the back and shaking
          their hands. The atmosphere is amiable.
          TEAM PAUL look at one another. ZOIL and MOSES have joined
          them. PAUL kisses and hugs RUTH.PAULI'm sorry I frightened you so much
          your hair turned white.RUTHYou didn't frighten me. You freed
          me. You helped me see the light.PAUL(TO MOSES)Take care of her big man.MOSES BEHEI will sir. God be with you.PAULWhatever dude.
          They high five. PAUL turns to ZOIL, whose arm is in a
          makeshift sling and shakes his hand.PAUL (CONT'D)Lorenzo Zoil, you're a good man.
          Say bye to Karen for me.ZOILSafe trip Short Round.
          PAUL turns to GRAHAM and CLIVE. He pulls JELVA - ALIEN QUEEN
          OF THE VARVAK from his pocket and hands it to them.CLIVEYou can keep it.PAULCool. Okay.GRAHAMWhat did you think?PAULYeah. Three tits, awesome. Although
          you know what? Sometimes, less is
          more.
          The boys nod.PAUL (CONT'D)Thank you.GRAHAMNo, thank you.117.CLIVEYou are, and always will be, our
          friend.PAULCome here you fucking geeks.
          They hug. He takes in incandescent orb from his pocket.PAUL (CONT'D)This is a self-sustaining light
          orb. Might come in handy, you know,
          if a bulb goes.
          TARA is waiting for her goodbye but PAUL ignores her. He face
          drops as he walks to his ship. He turns to her.PAUL (CONT'D)You coming?TARAWhat?PAULI ruined your life Tara. Think I
          owe you a new one.
          TARA takes PAUL's hand.TARAI don't have my toothbrush.PAULBaby, where we're going, you won't
          need teeth.
          TARA frowns then follows PAUL aboard. PAUL and TARA stand in
          the doorway. One of the other ALIENS comes out of a small
          room behind them, speaking in a strange tongue.
          Subtitle: THE BULB'S GONE IN THERE.
          As the door slowly closes, GRAHAM and CLIVE give PAUL the
          CE3K salute. PAUL gives them the finger. The boys laugh,
          tears in their eyes. The ship lifts off into the sky. GRAHAM,
          CLIVE, RUTH, MOSES and ZOIL watch them go. The light form the
          ship gradually fades, leaving them in darkness. Pause.GRAHAMThat was good, wasn't it?INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - DAYWe are at Comic-Con the following year. We come to rest on a
          long line of people. Sat behind a table are GRAHAM and CLIVE.
          They look more confident, cooler. CLIVE is talking to a short
          woman in an EWOK costume. He pats her on the ass as she walks
          away. All around them are stacks of their new novel: PAUL.118.A banner hangs behind, displaying the cover, GRAHAM's own
          rendering of their alien friend. They sign copies. The
          PUBLICIST mills around, looking very pleased.PUBLICISTJust one item per person please.
          He winks at the boys. RUTH rushes up to GRAHAM, she is
          dressed as Storm from X-Men and pushes a customized buggy, in
          which sits a baby dressed as Professor X.RUTHHey.GRAHAMHey babe. You okay?RUTHI'm just taking Tara over to the
