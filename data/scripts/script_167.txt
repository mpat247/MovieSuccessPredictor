THE BELIEVERWritten byHenry Bean & Mark Jacobson2000Final Shooting ScriptBLACK SCREENRAV ZINGESSER"And God said to Abraham, 'Take your
                    son, your only son, whom you love,
                    Isaac, and go into the land of Moriah
                    and offer him there for a sacrifice
                    upon a mountain that I will show you..."INT. YESHIVA CLASSROOM -- DAYA run-down place. A dozen 12-year-old BOYS sit at old-
          fashioned desks. These are not Hasidim, but Orthodox Jews:
          normal American kids in yarmulkes. The teacher, RAV
          ZINGESSER is young, overweight, acnescarred, good-humored.RAV ZINGESSERAnd why did the Holy One -- blessed
                    be He -- do this? Why did he ask
                    Abraham to sacrifice his only son,
                    whom he loved?Two boys off to one side: AVI (a smart, tough, brownnose)
          and DANNY (the eternal dissident) argue under their breath....12-YEAR-OLD DANNYIsaac wasn't his only son. Ishmael
                    was his son, too.12-YEAR-OLD AVIThe only son he loved.12-YEAR-OLD DANNYOh, they only kill them when they
                    love them...?12-YEAR-OLD STUART(up front; answering Zingesser)
                    It was a test of Abraham's faith. Of
                    his devotion to God.12-YEAR-OLD DANNYIt's not about Abraham's faith. It's
                    about God's power. God says, "You
                    know how powerful I am? I can make
                    you do anything I want, no matter how
                    stupid. Even kill your own son.
                    Because I'm everything, you're nothing."TITTERS. Danny looks around at his classmates: nerds,
          wankers, nose-pickers. Two kids in back furtively read the
          racing form under their desks. He hates them for their
          indifference as much as he despises Stuart's piety or Avi's
          ass-kissing.RAV ZINGESSERBut, Danny, if HaShem is everything,
                    and we are nothing how are we to
                    judge His actions?12-YEAR-OLD DANNYWe have free will and intelligence --
                    which God allegedly gave us....AVIAnyway, God never lets Abraham kill
                    Isaac. He provides the ram so that --12-YEAR-OLD DANNYPersonally, I think that's a lie. I
                    think he did kill him.RAV ZINGESSERYou think?! Based on what?12-YEAR-OLD DANNYThere's midrash supporting this. My
                    father read a book by Shalom Spiegel
                    that -- Isaac actually died and was
                    reborn.RAV ZINGESSERNo one follows that midrash.12-YEAR-OLD DANNYI do; I follow it. But okay, say God
                    provided the ram. So what? Once
                    Abraham raised the knife, in his
                    heart it was as if he'd killed him.
                    He could never forget that. And
                    neither could Isaac. Look at him:
                    he's traumatized, he's a putz for the
                    rest of his life. By the end he can't
                    tell Jacob from Esau....The kids laugh. Zingesser CRACKS a ruler against a desk.RAV ZINGESSERWatch your language....12-YEAR-OLD DANNY(rising impassioned)
                    I think the whole Jewish people were
                    permanently scarred by what happened
                    on Mt. Moriah, and we still live in
                    terror....12-YEAR-OLD STUARTFear of God is the beginning of wisdom.12-YEAR-OLD DANNYFear of God makes you afraid of
                    everything. All the Jews are good at
                    is being afraid. And being sacrificed.Oooo. CRACK, CRACK, CRACK. Even the guys with the sports
          pages are shocked by that one.12-YEAR-OLD STUARTDon't you believe in God?12-YEAR-OLD DANNYI'm the only one here who does
                    believe. You say he's mysterious, yet
                    merciful. I see him for the power-
                    drunk madman He is. And we're
                    supposed to worship such a Deity?? I
                    say Never! I say...fight him. I say --The ruler has been CRACKING from "power-drunk" on.... Now
          Zingesser grabs Danny, yanks him out of his chair.RAV ZINGESSERAvi -- ask Rabbi Springer to come
                    remove Danny from the class....Avi rises, grinning, as...Danny struggles wildly to get free.RAV ZINGESSERAnd you, if you had come out of Egypt,
                    you would have been destroyed in the
                    desert with those who worshipped the
                    Golden Calf.12-YEAR-OLD DANNYThen let Him destroy me now. Let Him
                    crush me like the conceited bully He is.

                    Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!The class sits frozen in terror, waiting for God to kill
          Danny. But nothing happens.INT. YESHIVA STAIRWELL -- NIGHTDanny runs down the steps alone.EXT. RUN-DOWN COMMERCIAL AREA -- TWILIGHTDanny walking home alone. He sees TWO KIDS (older, tougher,
          blonder) coming toward him. He slips off his yarmulke and
          slants across the street. The kids slant that way. He hears
          a RUMBLING, looks up at an ELEVATED TRAIN entering a station.
          He runs up the steps toward the SHRIEKING train....INT. 7 TRAIN -- 1998 -- DAYTITLE: 13 YEARS LATERThe train passes above used car lots, discount furniture
          stores, residential side streets...finally pulls into a
          station. The doors open. People file on, the CAMERA letting
          them go by until it spots a tall, thin COLLEGE STUDENT in a
          YARMULKE. Danny grown up?PAN with him as he sits, opens an organic chemistry text. The
          doors close. The train starts up, but the Jewish boy hardly
          notices; he is already reading. He sways with the motion of
          the car, half-hidden by other passengers. We realize he is
          being watched.REVERSE ANGLE: another YOUNG MAN, standing -- a "SUEDE-HEAD"
          (his hair cut so short it's like a fine fabric).SUEDE-HEAD'S POV: THE JEWISH BOY pushes his glasses back up
          his nose, wipes the nose with a handkerchief, puts the
          handkerchief away, and all the time his eyes have not left
          the page. Suede-head steps between passengers and stands
          directly over the Jewish boy. He looks down at the yarmulke
          pinned to the stiff, wavy hair, at the oversized shirt
          collar, scrawny neck, prominent Adam's apple, pimples,
          dandruff, ingrown facial hair...He steps closer, crowding the boy's knees. The boy shifts a
          little without looking up. Subtly but relentlessly, Suede-
          head pursues him along the bench until, unable to slide
          farther, the boy flattens his legs against the seat. Suede-
          head presses into the boy's knees.The boy accidentally bumps a BUSINESSMAN to Suede-head's
          left. The man (late 30s, Wall Street Journal, African-
          American) looks from the boy to Suede-head and understands
          at once what is going on.Suede-head stares right back -- and the BUSINESSMAN returns
          to his paper. Suede-head eases him aside and steps on the
          boy's shoe.SHOES -- A HEAVY BLACK BOOT PINS A BROWN WINGTIP TO THE FLOORThe wingtip wiggles back and forth, finally working free.
          The boy still hasn't looked up.SUEDE-HEAD & THE JEWISH BOYswaying, locked in a strange, silent intimacy. Suede-head
          forces the boy into ever more contorted postures,
          increasingly ridiculous denials of what is happening. And
          the boy not only never stops reading the chemistry text, he
          keeps highlighting relevant passages.The train slows. The boy closes the book, caps the
          highlighter, gathers his things and manages to stand up,
          wriggling awkwardly around Suede-head. The doors open, he
          gets off.INT. STATION -- DAYLooking up a long escalator, the Jewish boy riding down
          toward us.Suede-head arrives on the run at the top, races down a
          flight of stairs, vaults the bannister, slides down a metal
          slope....Lands on his feet and comes to stand at the foot of the
          escalator.The boy rides inexorably down. At the bottom, he tries to go
          around Suede-head who blocks this way, then another, driving
          him into a corner.The boy realizes he has nowhere to go -- finally turns to
          face his tormentor. Their eyes meet for the first time. He
          is actually bigger than Suede-head, but not nearly as strong.
          He won't fight, is simply acknowledging what he can no
          longer deny. There is even an odd relief that disgusts
          Suede-head more than all the rest.SUEDE-HEADFucking kike.He slaps him in the face. He stumbles backward. As Suede-
          head goes to hit him again, the boy holds his books in front
          of him. Suede-head punches the books straight into his face.
          The boy falls, curls into a fetal position. Suede-head kicks
          him....SUEDE-HEADGet up.... Get the fuck up....He won't budge. Suede-head punches him repeatedly until he
          hears VOICES approaching. He runs back up the stairs to the
          train and only as we FOLLOW him do we realize that he is our
          protagonist. This is Danny grown up.CUT TO:INT. DANNY'S STUDIO APARTMENT -- NIGHTLike his brain, the room is at once crowded and tidy and has,
          so far as we can see, neither windows nor doors. Shelves of
          books, CDs, magazines, videotapes loom over a neatly made bed.Danny, in briefs and boots, is lifting weights. The phone
          rings. A machine picks up: no outgoing message, only a BEEP.

          for air, heart pounding, muscles throbbing.INT. SAME -- NIGHTA radio is playing the news. Danny sits at a small desk, on
          the phone and browsing the Internet, a take-out menu beside him.DANNY (INTO PHONE)...Is it completely vegetarian?

          watches the skinheads enough to make them aware of him.The girls watch him, too. The skins don't like that. One of
          them (Billings) seems ready to do something about it. The
          others try to calm him, and when they look back, Danny has
          left. He barely touched the drink.The skins are puzzled, but one indicates his watch: time to
          go. They gather their stuff....EXT. CITY/INT. 7 TRAIN -- EVENINGLooking out the front of the train as it rushes toward
          Manhattan. A dramatic sky rises above the skyline.EXT. STREET -- NIGHTThe three skins -- O.L., CARLETON, BILLINGS -- walk up an

                    twenty years ago, when a kid walked
                    down the street, everyone knew who he
                    was...INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHTGrand but threadbare. The skins enter: O.L. like a child,
          Carleton like a sardonic adolescent, Billings like a
          revolutionary, Danny like an uncrowned prince.CURTIS ZAMPF is addressing a dozen or so guests. He is 40
          but appears younger; with rough good looks, longish hair and
          a leather jacket, he seems more like an aging rock star or
          sexy novelist that a standard-issue American Nazi.CURTIS...If he ran out in front of a car,
                    some old Mick'd yell at him, "Jimmy

                    stay there...."He does the Boston Irish accent so well, everybody laughs.
          Up front we notice the only WOMAN in the room. She is in her
          40s, regal, beautiful, forbidding. Her name is LINA MOEBIUS.CURTIS...The day he graduated high school,
                    he'd go see his uncle down at the gas
                    works, or the priest's brother in the
                    shipyard, get his apprentice papers,
                    eight years later he'd be making
                    $16.50 an hour, have four kids, play
                    ball on Sundays in Columbus Park, and
                    when he died, the whole town'd get
                    drunk and cry over him....The crowd -- nonunion electricians, white taxi drivers,
          unemployed bookkeepers, failed academics, off-duty cops --
          listens quietly.During this, a young woman (CARLA) appears from the rear of
          the apartment, heading for the kitchen with a coffee cup and
          a history book. She glances into the living room.CURTIS...Today, when that kid walks down
                    the street it's full of trash and
                    half the faces are black. The
                    shipyard's closed, all the jobs at
                    the gas works are set-asides, and by
                    the time he drops out of school, he
                    can barely get a job at Burger King.
                    So he drinks, smokes crack, and when
                    he hangs himself on the front porch
                    at twenty-three, the only people at
                    his wake are a couple of buddies and
                    his mother. The boy's father won't
                    find out he's dead till six months

          is about to turn it on, when he notices Danny's reaction....GUYIs it okay if I record this?DANNYNo... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So
                    what's this about? Is this about me?GUYI'm trying to figure out where the
                    radical right is going to next....I
                    thought you were the most interesting
                    person at that meeting.DANNYWhat about Curtis Zampf?GUYCurtis is a politician -- and a bit
                    of a hustler. He's not a thinker.DANNYI agree.GUYThe other night you said the modern
                    world is a Jewish disease. Could you
                    elaborate on that?DANNYIn the movement -- the racialist
                    movement -- we believe there's a
                    hierarchy of the races. Not just in
                    IQ, but in the civilization, the art,
                    the forms of government, the
                    civilizations that each race
                    produces... Why are you writing this
                    down if you're recording it?GUYIt helps me concentrate.... So does
                    that mean you're a white supremacist?DANNYWhat should I be, a white inferior-
                    ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian?
                    Let me ask, where are your people from?GUYMy mother's family is French, my
                    father's was German, originally.DANNYGerman. Mine, too. So who do you
                    think's given more to the world, the
                    Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe,
                    Nietzsche -- or the entire continent
                    of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...GUYDanny, what about the Jews?Danny shifts in his seat, growing more interested....DANNYThe Jews are different.... Blacks are
                    disgusting and inferior, but it's
                    like criticizing a retarded child.
                    The Jews are...a poison in the human
                    well....GUYA poison...?DANNYLet me give you an example.... Sexuality.GUYSexuality??? What do you mean?DANNYYou ever fuck a Jewish girl?GUYWhat??!?DANNYDid you ever fuck one, Guy?GUY(laughing, embarrassed)
                    What's that go to do with...I've gone
                    out with a, with Jewish women. Why?DANNYAnd? WHat did you notice?GUYNotice? Like what...?DANNYJewish girls like to give head, right?GUYI don't know. Is that right?DANNYAnd Jewish men like to get it.GUYEverybody likes to, don't they?DANNYYes. It's very pleasurable. But the
                    Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?GUYWhy?DANNYBecause the Jew is essentially female.GUYFemale...DANNYReal men -- white, Christian men --
                    we fuck a woman. We make her come
                    with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't
                    like to penetrate and thrust -- he
                    can't assert himself that directly --
                    so he resorts to perversions. Oral
                    sex is technically a perversion, you
                    know that, don't you?
                        (as Guy nods)
                    After a woman has been with a Jewish
                    man, she never wants a normal partner
                    again. A normal man.GUYDoes that mean the Jew is the better
                    lover?DANNYYou're not listening. He isn't better.
                    He gives pleasure, but that's
                    actually a weakness.GUYDanny, what makes you think you know
                    all this?DANNYLet's just say I've done due diligence.GUYSo, fine, it's not that the Jew, the
                    Jews own the media and the banks.
                    It's that they're sexually corrupt.DANNYThe Jews clearly control the media
                    and the banks. Investment banks, not
                    the commercial ones. But the point is
                    they carry out in those realms the
                    same principles they display in
                    sexuality. They undermine traditional
                    life; they deracinate society.Danny leans over to make sure Guy's getting it right.DANNYDeracinate... Tear out the roots. A
                    people -- a real people -- derives
                    its genius from the land: the sun,
                    the sea, the soil. This is how they
                    know themselves. But the Jew doesn't
                    have soil.GUYHe has Israel.DANNYThose aren't Jews.GUYOf course they're Jews.DANNYNotice the Israelis: a fundamentally
                    secular society. They no longer need
                    Judaism because they have soil. The
                    real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He
                    has no roots, no attachments. So he
                    "universalizes" everything. He can't
                    hammer a nail, plow a field. He can
                    only buy and sell, invest capital,
                    manipulate markets. He takes the life
                    of a people rooted in soil and turns
                    it into a cosmopolitan culture based
                    on books, ideas, numbers. This is his
                    strength....
                        (pumped; this is what
                         he loves)
                    Take the great Jewish minds: Marx,
                    Freud, Einstein. What have they given
                    us: communism, infantile sexuality
                    and the atom bomb. In a mere three
                    centuries since these guys emerged
                    from the ghettos of Europe, they've
                    taken us from a world built on order
                    and reason and hurled us into a chaos
                    of class warfare, irrational urges
                    and relativity, a world where the
                    very existence of matter and meaning
                    is in doubt. Why? Because it is the
                    deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to
                    unravel the very fabric of life until
                    nothing is left but thread, nothing
                    but nothingness. Nothingness without
                    end...GUYAre all Jews the same?DANNYDifferences exist, of course, but
                    they're irrelevant. For the Jew, his
                    Jewishness dominates everything. Even
                    the ones who renounce it, who hate it,
                    who want to cut it out of their
                    hearts a knife...can't escape.
                    They're still just Jews.Guy finishes writing that and looks up.GUYDanny, this is great. You're
                    incredibly articulate. One more
                    thing... How can you believe this when

                    they are. Look, I thought I explained

                    It sounds strange, I know, but with
                    these people nothing is simple. The
                    Jew says that all he wants is to be
                    left alone to study his Torah, do a
                    little business and fornicate with
                    his over-sexed wife.... But it isn't
                    true. He wants to be hated. He longs
                    for our scorn. He clings to it as if
                    it were the very core and mystery of
                    his being. If Hitler had not existed,
                    the Jews would have invented him. For
                    without such hatred, the so-called
                    Chosen People would vanish from the
                    earth....People react with confusion, uncertainty, suspicion.DANNY...And this reveals a terrible truth,
                    the crux of our problem as Nazis: the
                    worse the Jews are treated, the
                    stronger they become. Egyptian
                    slavery made them a nation; the
                    pogroms hardened them, Auschwitz gave
                    birth to the State of Israel.
                    Suffering, it seems, is the very
                    crucible of their genius. If the Jews
                    are, as one of their own has said, a
                    people who will not take yes for an
                    answer, then let us say yes to them.
                    If they thrive on opposition, let us
                    cease to oppose them. The way to
                    annihilate them, utterly and
                    completely, is to open our arms, take
                    them into our homes and embrace them.
                    Only then will they vanish into
                    assimilation, dilution...and love.
                        (a warning finger)
                    But we cannot pretend. The Jew is
                    nothing if not clever. He will see
                    through condescension and hypocrisy.
