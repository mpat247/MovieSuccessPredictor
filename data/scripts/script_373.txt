FADE IN:EXT. PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND - WINTER MORNINGA PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN is standing on the street corner waiting
for a bus. She's carrying books and looking very collegiate.

A black stretch LIMOUSINE with darkened windows drives past,
SLAMS ON ITS BRAKES, and backs up. The Young Woman stares at
her reflection in the windows, wondering what this is all
about.

Finally, the REAR PASSENGER WINDOW zips down, revealing LLOYD
CHRISTMAS, age 30. He's a pleasant-enough looking guy, if a
little shaggy. He's wearing a dark suit.LLOYDExcuse me, can you tell me how to
           get to the medical school? I'm
           supposed to be giving a lecture in
           twenty minutes and my driver's a bit
           lost.YOUNG WOMAN(heavy European accent)
           Go straight aheads and makes a left
           over za bridge.

Lloyd checks out her body.LLOYDI couldn't help noticing the accent.
           You from Jersey?YOUNG WOMAN(unimpressed)
           Austria.LLOYDAustria? You're kidding.
               (mock-Australian accent)
           Well, g'day, mate. What do you say
           we get together later and throw a
           few shrimp on the barbie.

The Young Woman turns her back to him and walks away.LLOYD (CONT'D)(to self)
           Guess I won't be going Down Under
           tonight...

He SIGHS and zips the window back up.2.INT. LIMOLloyd climbs through the driver's partition into the front
seat. Then he puts a CHAUFFEUR'S CAP on his head and drives
away. We see that HE'S THE DRIVER!

The dispatch radio CRACKLES TO LIFE:DISPATCHER(v.o.)
            Carr 22, come in, car 22...

Lloyd grabs his CB mike.LLOYDThis is 22.DISPATCHER22, where the hell are you, Lloyd?
            You're running late on the East Side
            pick-up.LLOYDCool your jets, Arnie. I'm on my
            way.DISPATCHER(v.o.)
            Well hurry it up. And make sure you
            park legally. One more ticket and
            your ass is history.CUT TO:EXT. MUTT CUTS DOG SALON - DAYThis building is white with black spots on it, like a
DALMATION. Over the front door is an awning shaped like a
DOG'S SNOUT, whiskers included. A van pulls up outside.

The vehicle is decorated like a GIANT POODLE, with four legs
hanging off the sides, a tail in the rear, and a dog's snout
on the front grill. MUTT CUTS is written on the side of it.

HARRY DUNNE climbs out. He's in his early 30s and dressed in
a ridiculous BEAGLE COSTUME, including a CAP WITH FLOPPY
EARS. He goes to the rear of the van, opens it, and a swarm
of DOGS pile out.HARRYOkay, gang, single file. You know
            the rules: No pushing, no humping,
            and no sniffing heinies...3.The door to the shop opens and Harry's annoyed boss, MR.
PALMER, sticks his head out.PALMERHey, why aren't those mutts on
          leashes?HARRYThe same reason you're not on a leash,
          sir because it's demeaning and it
          chafes like hell.PALMERJust get them in here now! They all
          have to be bathed and clipped in an
          hour.

Palmer disappears back inside. Harry CALLS to the dogs but
they pay no attention. He struggles to keep them from
wandering off. He grabs a couple of SMALL POOCHES and sits
them on a wall.HARRYYou kids stay right here...

As he turns to round up the other, we discover that the wall
isn't a wall it's a flatbed truck. The truck drives away,
taking the two dogs with it.HARRY (CONT'D)(at truck)
          Hey, wait a minute!

Harry chases after the vehicle.CUT TO:EXT. EAST SIDE ESTATE - DAYLloyd Christmas pulls the limousine into a long, tree-lined
driveway. He gets out and looks up in awe at an IMPRESSIVE
STONE MANSION. He WHISTLES to himself, then walks to the
front oor and RINGS THE BELL.

The double-front doors of the mansion open and MARY SWANSON
appears. She's 25 and gorgeous. Lloyd's jaw drops open when
he lays eyes on her.MARYHello.
              (beat)
          I'll be just a minute...4.As Mary steps back inside, Lloyd takes out a tiny can of
Binaca. He sprays his mouth, under his arms, his hair, behind
his ears...CUT TO:INT. LIMO - DAYLloyd is driving and Mary is in the back, looking out the
window, lost in thought. She's got a BRIEFCASE resting on
her lap and she fingers the leather nervously. Lloyd keeps
glancing at her in the rear-view mirror, but for a moment he
is speechless. Then:LLOYDWhy you going to the airport? Flying
          somewhere?MARY(dead-pan)
          How'd you guess?LLOYDWell, I saw your luggage, then when
          I noticed the airline ticket, I put
          two and two together.
              (beat)
          So where you heading?MARYAspen.LLOYDOh, you're gonna love it. I hear
          California's beautiful this time of
          year.
Mary looks back out the window and Lloyd sneaks another
glance.LLOYD (CONT'D)Name's Christmas. Lloyd Christmas.MARYI'm Mary.

ON LLOYD - we can almost see his mind work. He's desperate
to impress her.LLOYDUh, this isn't my real job, you know.
          It's only temporary.5.MARYOh?LLOYDYeah, you see, my friend Harry and I
          are saving up our money so we can
          open our own pet store.MARYThat's nice.LLOYD(smiling)
          I got worms.MARYI beg your pardon?LLOYDThat's what we're gonna call it: I
          Got Worms. We're gonna specialize in
          selling worm farms you know, like
          ant farms. A lot of people don't
          realize that worms make much better
          pets than ants. They're quiet,
          affectionate, they don't bite, and
          they're super with the kids.MARYAren't ants quiet, too?

Lloyd realizes she has a point.LLOYDUh... well, sure but they aren't half
          as affectionate. And if you cut an
          ant's head off, it won't grow back.MARYI see.LLOYDAnd best of all, worm farming is a
          seventy-five-thousand-dollar-a-year
          industry. I wouldn't mind having a
          piece of that pie, if you know what
          I mean.

To her credit, she doesn't. They continue driving. Mary looks
at her watch and crosses her legs. Lloyd can see that she's
concerned about something.6.LLOYD (CONT'D)What's the matter? Little tense about
          the flight?MARY(beat)
          Something like that.

Lloyd SWIVELS AROUND and STARES over his shoulder at her.LLOYDIt's really nothing to worry about,
          Mary. Statistically, they say you're
          more likely to get killed on the way
          to the airport. You know, like in a
          head-on crash, or something.MARYUm, Lloyd, could please keep your
          eyes on the road.LLOYDGood thinking. There's a lot of bad
          rivers out there.

Lloyd turns back to the steering wheel.CUT TO:EXT. AIRPORT - DAYLloyd is putting the last bags on a cart. He closes the trunk
and turns to Mary. She looks nervous and disconcerted as she
reaches into her purse. She pulls out a ten-dollar tip.MARYHere you go.LLOYDKeep it. It was my pleasure.

For the first time, Mary Swanson offers a slight smile. This
makes her more lovely than ever.LLOYD (CONT'D)Relax, Mary. Just get trashed and
          pass out. You'll be there before you
          know it.MARYThanks Lloyd.
              (beat)
          And good luck with your worms.7.Then she PICKS UP HER BRIEFCASE and walks into the terminal,
followed by a PORTER pushing her bags. Lloyd watches her,
ENCHANTED, until she's out of sight.

Afterwards, he climbs back into the limo,  LOVESICK. For a
moment he doesn't even have the energy to  turn the key. He
just drops his head against the steering  wheel, DEVASTATED.
There's a TAP on the window. Lloyd looks  up to see a POLICE
OFFICER standing there.POLICE OFFICERCome on, move it, you're in a red
          zone.

Lloyd starts the limo and pulls away.CUT TO:INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAYMary looks tense as she moves through the throngs of
travelers. Her pace is slow, deliberate, and her eyes are
focused straight ahead.

She passes a row of phone botths and two MEN one dressed in
an ARMANI SUIT, the other in a PLAID SPORTCOAT watch her.ARMANI SUITShe's gonna leave the briefcase at
          the foot of the escalator. You make
          the pick-up.PLAID SPORTCOATPiece of cake.EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAYAs Lloyd pulls his limo slowly away, he glances in the airport
window and SEES MARYWALKING ALONG.When she stops at the foot of the escalator, he stops, too.
She puts down the briefcase and checks her coat pocket for
her ticket. Lloyd's attention is distracted by a HONK. He
turns to see a car irectly behind him.LLOYD(to car's driver)
          Drive around me, you pinhead!

When he turns back to watch Mary in the terminal he sees
that SHE'S GONE, and she's LEFT HER BRIEFCASE AT THE FOOT OF
THE STAIRS. Lloyd jumps to ATTENTION.8.He pulls the car into a HANDICAPPED SPOT and hops out. He
starts to run into the terminal, then notices the Police
Officer and suddenly goes into a spastic walk, limping and
dragging him leg behind him like a palsy victim.INT. AIRPORT TERMINALThe Armani Man nods to the Plaid Sportcoat and he starts to
approach the briefcase. Just as Plaid Sportcoat is reaching
for the handle, LLOYD RUNS BY AND GRABS IT. He CONTINUES UP
THE ESCALATOR three steps at a time. The two men look at
each other, dumbstruck.INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - BOARDING GATELloyd runs with the briefcase to the TV monitors that post
the departure times. He looks frantically at the confusion
of numbers.LLOYDDamn!

QUICK CUT of a dejected Lloyd looking out the window as he
watches as Mary's airplane taxiing away.EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAYLloyd comes out with the briefcase, passing the two men, who
FOLLOW HIM AT A DISTANCE. He starts walking down the sidewalk
when suddenly he STOPS IN HIS TRACKS.

HIS POV - his limo is being towed away    under the supervision
of the Police Officer.

He takes off after it, but to no avail.LLOYDYou can't do this! I'll lose my job!

As Lloyd watches the limo get towed out of site, he runs his
fingers through his hair.CUT TO:EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - AFTERNOONWe see the Mutt Cuts van pull up and park at the curb. A
dejected Harry climbs out. At the same time, a taxi pulls up
and drops off Lloyd. (He's clutching Mary Swanson's
briefcase.) Both he and Harry climb the steps of the building.
They disappear inside without acknowledging each other.9.ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET - a black Cadillac pulls up
and parks. Inside are the Armani suit and the Sportcoat.
They are J.P. SHAY and JOSEPH MENTALINO (aka JOEMENTAL).MENTALWho the hell do you figure this guy's
           working for?SHAYI don't know, but we'd better find
           out...

Mental takes some PILLS and starts CHOMPING them.SHAY (CONT'D)Your ulcer?MENTALIt ain't gonna kill me.INT. APARTMENT CORRIDORLloyd and Harry trudge up the stairs and proceed silently
toward the door of their apartment.INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOMLloyd and Harry ENTER and   pass each other quietly as they
both plunk down in their   favorite easy chairs. (Lloyd still
has the briefcase in his   lap.) Harry's caged parakeet, PETEY,
tweets hello, but the two   guys just sit there SILENTLY.

The place is a mess. Wallpaper's peeling off the walls. The
carpet is threadbare and filthy. In the corner we see a
miniature WORM FARM and a large terrarium filled with dirt
and worms. Here are a couple pieces of haggard furniture
with stuffing spilling out of the gashes.HARRYI got fired again.

Lloyd shakes his head.LLOYDI don't mean to be harsh, Harry, but
           let's face it, you are one pathetic
           loser. No offense.HARRYNone taken. Were you shitcanned,
           too?10.LLOYDOf course not.
              (beat)
          I quit.HARRYWhy'd you quit?LLOYDI had a hunch Arnie was gonna fire
          me.HARRYWhy didn't you wait and see if your
          suspicions were well-founded?LLOYDWinners control their own destiny,
          Har.

Lloyd fetches a couple beers from the fridge and throws one
to him.HARRYYou know, the thing that really chaps
          my ass is that I just spent my life
          savings turning my van into a poodle.
              (beat)
          The alarm alone cost me two hundred.LLOYDBig deal. That car's an old bomb
          anyway.HARRYWhat are you talking about? It's
          only six years old.LLOYDThat's forty-two in dog years.

They open their beers and drink simultaneously. Then Harry
notices the briefcase.HARRYWhat's with the briefcase?LLOYDIt's a love memento.HARRYHuh?11.LLOYDThe most beautiful woman alive. Her
            name was Mary. I drove her to the
            airport. Sparks flew, emotions ran
            high, breasts heaved. She left this
            case in the terminal and flew to
            Aspen and out of my life. End of
            story.HARRYWhat's in it?LLOYDDO you really expect me to go snooping
            around in someone else's private
            property?HARRYWhy not?LLOYD(beat)
            It's locked.

They take another sip of their beers. Suddenly we hear a
LOUD KNOCK at the door. Petey the parakeet starts to SQUAWK.
The guys look at each other, ALARMED, then Harry tip-toes to
thePEEPHOLE.HARRY'S POV - a DISTORTED-LOOKING J.P. Shay and Joe Mental
are standing at the door.LLOYD (CONT'D)(WHISPERING to Harry)
            Friend or foe?HARRY(WHISPERING)We don't have any friends.

Harry is still squinting out the peephole.HARRY (CONT'D)Can't recognize them. Could be student
            loan thugs again, or the IRS, or
            maybe somebody pissed off about that
            case of Girl Scout cookies you bounced
            a check on.12.LLOYDHey, I ordered Mystic Mint. The little
          swindlers gave me Peanut Butter
          Praline.HARRYWell, whoever they are, they look
          serious. One of them's even wearing
          plaid.LLOYD(cringing)
          That's a hostile pattern. I say we
          bail and get down to unemployment.

Lloyd GRABS THE BRIEFCASE and the two of them EXIT out the
window and down the fire escape.CUT TO:EXT. UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE - AFTERNOONThe poodle van pulls up to the curb in front of the building

He stops at a newspaper machine, pulls out his WALLET and
removes a quarter.

He drops the quarter in the machine, opens it, and realizes
that he DOESN'T HAVE A FREE HAND to pick up the newspaper.
He puts his wallet inside the machine, picks up the newspaper,
and as he does so THE MACHINE SLAMS SHUT WITH HIS WALLETSTILL INSIDE.Lloyd SIGHS, puts his grocery bags on the machine, and checks
his pockets. NO MORE CHANGE. Just then, an ELDERLY WOMAN

cityscape.LLOYDYou know what I'm sick and tired of,

Harry tries to lighten the mood. He opens his arms wide.HARRYCome on, Lloyd. Give us a kiss.LLOYDOn the other hand, maybe you're right,
          Harry. Maybe we should stay here and
          try our luck in bankruptcy court.

mountain view.78.HARRYOh god, it's really true. Last night
           I thought I might've been dreaming.LLOYDIt's no dream, Har. We finally cracked
           the big time.HARRYAnd it was so simple. All it took
           was somebody else's money.

Harry LIGHTS A CIGAR WITH A TWENTY DOLLAR BILL, takes a hearty
puff, andEXHALES.HARRY (CONT'D)You know, Lloyd, I think you might've
           gone a little overboard with the
           spending today.

He blows out the twenty and tosses it off the balcony.LLOYDWhat's the big deal? We're gonna pay
           it all back anyway, right?HARRYSure, but do you really think you
           needed to buy those two surfboards?LLOYDSurfboards? I thought those were
           beginner's skis.
This suddenly makes sense to Harry.HARRYAhhh. I was wondering why you had
           those bindings put on them.

Lloyd opens a box and holds up a SCANTY NEGLIGEE.LLOYDWhere'd this come from?HARRY(sheepishly)
           I bought it.LLOYDWhat for?79.HARRYI like the feel of it against my
          skin...
                (defensive)
          ...I mean, you know, when a woman's
          wearing it.

Lloyd inspects it more closely.LLOYDHarry, how many women do you know
          who wear a size XXL?HARRYLook, leave me alone. I'm rich now.
          I'm supposed to have a few
          eccentricities.

There's a KNOCK on the door.LLOYDEnter, parlez vous!

The Bell Captain, Barnard, ENTERS with a champagne bucket
and a newspaper under his arm.BARNARDI brought you your newspaper and
          some champagne, gentlemen.
          Unfortunately, we didn't seem to
          have the, um, label you requested.

Lloyd examines the champagne's label and frowns.LLOYDAll out of Boone's Farm, huh?BARNARDYou have a rapier wit, sir. I took
          the liberty of bringing a comparable
          substitute: Dom Perignon.LLOYDGuess it'll have to do, slugger, eh?

Lloyd smiles and over tips him.BARNARDThank you so much, sir.

He puts the tray down, hands Lloyd the newspaper, and heads
for the door.80.LLOYDOh, one more thing: You can     dispense
          with the 'sir' crap. Let's     face it,
          Barney, we're all from the     same mold.
              (winks)
          We just have a little more     dough
          than you right now.

Barnard smiles and EXITS. Harry comes back in the room. He
picks up a champagne glass and flicks it with his finger,
sending out a resonant RING.HARRYCocktail hour has commenced!

He starts to open the champagne bottle as Lloyd begins
thumbing through the newspaper.HARRY (CONT'D)Hey, later on what do you say we...?

He notices that Lloyd's mouth has dropped open at something
he's found in the paper.HARRY (CONT'D)Lloyd... you okay?LLOYD(dumbstruck)
          Harry, it's her.HARRYWho?LLOYDMary with the briefcase. This is
          her...

He shoves the newspaper at Harry.

CLOSE ON THE HEADLINE - it reads: SWANSONS TO HOST
PRESERVATION GALA TONIGHT; CITY'S ELITE EXPECTED. Underneath
this is a photograph of Mary with her parents.LLOYD (CONT'D)Mary Swanson...HARRYCome on, Cinderella, it's time to
          get you ready for the ball...

Roy Orbison's "Pretty Woman" plays over a...MONTAGE OF HARRY AND LLOYD'S GLAMOUR MAKE-OVER:81.-The boys are in a beauty parlor getting their hair shampooed.

-Harry and Lloyd sit beneath old-fashioned hair dryers. The
ATTENDANTS lift the dryers from their heads, revealing both
guys' hair in curlers.

-Lloyd's getting shaved by an ATTENDANT with a straight-razor.
Suddenly Lloyd grabs his neck

as if he's been nicked. BLOOD SQUIRTS OUT from between his
fingers. The other CUSTOMERS stare in horror at this. Lloyd
LAUGHS and shows everyone a SQUEEZE KETCHUP BOTTLE hidden in
his hand. Only Harry and Lloyd seem to find this joke amusing.

-We see them getting their nose hairs clipped. PAN DOWN to
the floor to reveal a PILE OFNOSE HAIR CLIPPINGS.-Then a   shot of a MAN next to them getting a pedicure. PAN
OVER to   Lloyd's bare feet  he has toe nails like Howard
Hughes.   Sparks are flying as an ATTENDANT wearing safety
goggles   tries to sand down Lloyd's toenails with an electric
sander.

-Harry is lying on his stomach with his shirt off, getting a
massage from a beautiful ORIENTAL MASSEUSE. He pulls a hundred
dollar bill from under his towel, hands it to her, and
WHISPERS in her ear. She smiles.

-Next we see the Oriental Masseuse lying on her stomach with
her shirt off, while Harry happily massages her back.

-The guys are in an expensive haberdashery. Harry comes out
of the dressing room in a very elegant BLACK TUXEDO. He
couldn't look any more suave. The SALEMAN nods, impressed,
but Lloyd shakes his head no and Harry goes back in.

-Harry reappears in another stylish WHITE TUXEDO. The Salesman
looks on hopefully, but Lloyd again disapproves.

-This time Harry comes out in a JUNIOR-PROM-LIKE SKY-BLUE
TUXEDO, complete with TACKY FRILLS. The Salesman looks
sickened as Lloyd give Harry the thumbs up.

PAN ACROSS THE STREET from the haberdashery - an apprehensive
J.P. Shay is sitting in a parked car, WATCHING HARRY ANDLLOYD.DISSOLVE TO:82.EXT. ASPEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY - NIGHTThrongs of GUESTS in black-tie and elegant gowns are entering
the building. Suddenly the hearse pulls up with Harry and
Lloyd BUMPER SURFING BEHIND IT. Harry's wearing his blue
tuxedo. Lloyd's tux isn't any better it's pumpkin orange.
(THEY'VE GOT MATCHING TOP HATS AND CANES.) When the hearse
stops, the boys hand the driver Barnard a couple hundred
dollars.LLOYDThanks for the lift, Barney.INT. ASPEN PRESERVATION SOCIETYNicholas Andre is greeting people at the door. However, when
Harry and Lloyd try to enter, he stops them and gives them
the once over.ANDREExcuse me, gentlemen, but this is a
          five-hundred-dollar-a-plate dinner.

Harry and Lloyd look at each other and shrug. Then Lloyd
takes out a WAD OF BILLS and peels

off TEN HUNDREDS, much to the amazement of Andre.LLOYDThis should cover a couple plates.HARRYI'm kind of hungry, Lloyd. What if
          we want seconds?

Lloyd thinks about this. Then he peels off another thou.LLOYDPut us down for four plates, my good
          man.

They ENTER the party. As Andre watches them go, his associate
J.P. Shay comes up beside him, an alarmed look on his face.J.P. SHAY(WHISPERING)Jesus Christ, boss... it's them.

BACK ON HARRY AND LLOYD - the guys make their way through
the affluent crowd.LLOYDI'm getting nervous, Harry.83.HARRYrelax, Lloyd. These people are just
          like you and me.LLOYDWhat are you talking about? They're
          educated, well-bred, charming, and
          sophisticated.HARRYSo what? We can be sophistica holy
          shit, would you look at the fun bags
          on that hose hound.

He points out a busty BLONDE BOMBSHELL entering the party.
Lloyd rolls his eyes.LLOYDDon't do this to me, Harry. I'm
          already a wreck. What if Mary oesn't
          like me?HARRYLook, let's just go saddle up to the
          bar and down a couple bowls of
          loudmouth soup. A little booze'll
          bring back that old Lloyd Christmas
          over-confidence.

The guys stand out at the glittering social scene as they
make their way to the bar.LLOYD(to BARTENDER)
          Two martinis, straight up.
As Harry and Lloyd silently take in the party, a BEAUTIFUL
RED HEAD reaches between them for a cocktail napkin, then
walks away.LLOYD (CONT'D)Shut up, Harry.HARRYI didn't say anything.LLOYDYeah, well I know what you were gonna
          say and I'm telling you to shut up
          in advance.HARRYHow do you know what I was gonna
          say?84.LLOYDI read you like a book.HARRYOkay, if you read me like a book
          then what was I gonna say?LLOYDYou were gonna say:
              (in Harry's loopedVOICE)'That's one fiery bush I wouldn't
          mind roasting my weenie in.'

Harry raises his eyebrows, IMPRESSED.LLOYD (CONT'D)And I would say 'shut up', because
          this is our chance to get in with
          the rich and powerful and you don't
          ingratiate yourself to the kind of
          people by acting like Ron Jeremy on
          Spanish Fly.

The Bartender delivers their martinis as we hear the o.s.
CLINKING of a glass. The guys turns to

see Nicholas Andre standing at a podium. Next to him is a
LARGE, COVERED DISPLAY. On his other side are Karl and
Elizabeth Swanson.ANDREIf I could have your attention,
          please...

The crowd QUIETS.ANDRE (CONT'D)I'd like to thank you all for coming
          to this very special event. As youKNOW, THE ASPEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY -founded and chiefly funded by our great benefactors, Karl
and Helen Swanson - is the world's foremost efender of
endangered species. OurSPRAWLING GROUNDS ARE HOME TO TWENTY-three separate varieties of animals that are currently listed
on the United Nation's charter of protected species. Tonight,
we are deeply honored to have Mr. Karl Swanson welcome our
twenty-fourth.85.The crowd CLAPS as Mr. Swanson takes Andre's place at the
podium.MR. SWANSONLadies and gentlemen, I give you the
          Icelandic Snow Owl.

He pulls the cover off, revealing TWO MAJESTIC, FLUFFY WHITE
OWLS IN A CAGE. Everyone OOHS and AHHS.MR. SWANSON (CONT'D)These magnificent specimens wereRESCUED RECENTLY, CULMINATING A FIVE-year, two-million-dollar effort on our part. Together, they
constitute one-seventh of the snow owl population left on
the planet.

ON ANDRE - he's nervously eyeing Harry and Lloyd. He looks
pale.MR. SWANSONHere these lovely birds will be
          allowed to breed in a natural but
          protected habitat. And, God willing,
          with your help and that of the
          Society's, we will see these wonderful
          creatures flourish once more.

More APPLAUSE.MR. SWANSON (CONT'D)Again, thank you, and enjoy your
          evening. Oh, and feel free to take a
          closer look at our new friends here.
          Enjoy.

The crowd APPLAUDS and begins to mingle again. Lloyd turns
back to the Bartender and holds up his empty glass.LLOYDTwo more, please.

Harry stares at Lloyd with concern.HARRYLloyd, I've never seen you this
          uptight. You've gotta chill out.LLOYDI can't help it. This is a very
          important night for me.(MORE)86.LLOYD (CONT'D)(beat)
          Harry, have you ever wondered why
          you and I never have long-term
          girlfriends?HARRYWhat are you talking about? I went
          out with Fraida Felcher for two and
          a half weeks.LLOYDThat was a fluke.
              (beat)
          The reason we never have long-term
          girlfriends is because of one thing:
          We're afraid of the C word.HARRYThat's crazy. We live for the C word.LLOYDI'm talking bout commitment.HARRY(beat)
          Oh.LLOYDWell I'm ready for commitment, Harry.
          The first time I laid eyes on Mary
          Swanson, I knew she was the one.
              (beat)
          Some things you feel in your heart,
          other things you feel in your groin.
          This girl makes me feel it all in
          the heart.

Suddenly Lloyd notices something across the room.HIS POV - A BEGUILING MARY SWANSON IS TALKING WITH A COUPLEOF GUESTS. SHE'S WEARING Aspectacular black cocktail dress.

Lloyd quickly turns toward the bar.LLOYD (CONT'D)Oh shit, there she is.87.HARRY(checking her out)
          Wow. You weren't kidding, Lloyd.
          She's an angel.
              (beat)
          Well, what are you waiting for? Get
          over there and talk to her.LLOYDShe's gonna think I'm some kind of
          psycho when she realizes how far I
          came just to see her.HARRYYou have her briefcase she's gonna
          be thrilled to see you.LLOYDAnd then what? She'll take it back
          and that'll be it. I'm a nobody.

Harry thinks about this a moment.HARRYLook, man, you just drove two thousand
          miles to see this girl. Don't quit
          on the last fifty feet.LLOYD(brightening)
          Wait a second, I have an idea. You
          go over and introduce yourself. That
          way you can build me up so when I
          come along I won't have to brag about
          myself. Tell her I'm good-looking
          and I'm rich and I have a rapist's
          wit.HARRYI can't tell her you're good looking,
          Lloyd she's got eyes.

Lloyd takes a big gulp of his new martini.LLOYDPlease Harry, I'm appealing to you
          as one loser to another. Just build
          me up and then give me a signal to
          come over. Please.

Harry SIGHS.88.HARRYAll right. But you're gonna owe me a
          big one for this.

Harry straightens his polka-dot bow-tie, then APPROACHES
Mary, who is now standing alone, admiring the owls.HARRY (CONT'D)Nice set of hooters you got there.

Mary turns to Harry, stunned.MARYI beg your pardon?HARRYThe owls. They're beautiful.MARYOh. Yeah.
              (beat)
          Are you a bird lover?HARRYWell, I used to have a parakeet, but
          my main area of expertise is canines
          that's dogs to the layperson.

She smiles at this.MARYThanks. I love dogs, too. So how

are you involved with them?HARRYOh, I've trained them, bathed them,
          clipped them; I've even bred them.MARYReally? Any unusual breeding?HARRYNah, mostly just doggie-style. But
          one time we successfully mated a
          Bulldog and a Shitzu.MARYReally? That's weird.HARRYYeah. We called it a Bullshit.
              (breaks out LAUGHING)
          Just a little breeder joke.89.She seems strangely charmed by this.HARRY (CONT'D)Anyway, the real reason I came over
          is because I want to introduce you
          to a friend of mine.

Just then, Mary's stepmother approaches. She's holding a
martini and looking a little sloshed.HELENMary, I don't believe I've met your
          friend.MARYActually, we haven't been introduced
          yet.
               (holds out hand)
          I'm Mary Swanson, and this is my
          stepmother, Helen.HARRYHarry Dunne. Pleasure meeting you
          both.HELENI saw you come in earlier, Mr. Dunne.
          I was hoping we'd get a chance to
          meet.HARRY(taken aback)
          You were?HELENThat tuxedo I love a man with a
          sense of humor. So does Mary.

Mary shoots Helen a look, then smiles at Harry.HARRYReally?

For a moment, he's caught up in Mary's eyes, but then manages
to snap out of it.HARRY (CONT'D)Anyway, about my friend you doing
          anything tomorrow, Mr. Dunne? Because
          I believe Mary's looking for somebody
          to hit the slopes with. Whuh?MARYHelen, you're embarrassing me.90.HELENWell you are, aren't you?
              (to Harry)
          Poor girl doesn't get out enough. So
          what do you say, Harry? Are you
          available?

Harry thinks about this, then looks across the room at a
hopeful Lloyd.HARRYOh, I don't know. You see, my friend
          your friends for one day. You and
          Mary will have a ball.

Mary's captivating eyes meet his, waiting for an answer.HARRY (CONT'D)Um... well... I don't know. You see, the
          thing is... sure.

ON LLOYD - he waits impatiently at the bar as Harry returns.LLOYDHow come you didn't call me over?HARRYRelax, you're golden. I got you a
          ate with her tomorrow.

Lloyd falls back against the bar and grabs his chest. He'sSPEECHLESS.LLOYDWha... you... I... it's...
                (smiles)
          I love you, man. I love you!

Lloyd clamps an embarrassed Harry in a TIGHT EMBRACE.HARRYOkay, get a grip, Lloyd. You're making
          a scene.

Lloyd steps back elated.LLOYDThis calls for a toast!

He grabs a bottle of champagne out of a bucket and starts to
open it.91.LLOYD (CONT'D)You're gonna be my best man, Har, I
          mean it. It was always between you
          and my future wife's brother, but
          you just earned a seat at the head
          table, pal.

Suddenly the CORK SHOOTS OUT OF THE CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE ANDZIPS ACROSSTHE ROOM LIKE A BULLET   DIRECTLY TOWARD ONE OF THE NOW EVENWIDER-EYED OWLS. In quick succession we hear a BOK!, a SQUAWK!,
and a THUMP!

A HUSH falls over the entire party as everyone turns their
stunned attention to the cage.THEIR POV - FEATHERS ARE FLOATING IN THE AIR THROUGHOUT THECAGE, AND ONE OF THE ICELANDIC SNOWOwls LIES ON ITS BACK, its species now one bird closer to
extinction.

Harry and Lloyd look on in horror. Harry takes the smoking
champagne bottle from Lloyd and places it on the bar.HARRY(under breath)
          I think we've done enough hobnobbing,
          Lloyd.

The guys LOWER THEIR HEADS and slink out of the room before
anyone can figure out what happened anyone except for
Nicholas Andre, that is; we PAN to show that he's been
standing nearby watching their every move. And he doesn't
look very happy.CUT TO:INT. AASPEN APARTMENT - NIGHTNicholas Andre is pacing the room with a drink in his hand
while J.P. Shay looks on nervously.J.P. SHAYMaybe it was just a coincidence.ANDREDon't be stupid. It's a message,
          plain and simple: We killed their
          bird, now they killed ours.92.J.P. SHAYBut how could anybody off a bird
          with a cork?ANDREThese guys arent' just anybody.
          They're good. Look what they did to

          fell right into their web.J.P. SHAYBut the bastards already got our
          money. What the hell more could they

b.g., Harry is putting on his new ski clothes including a
pair of thermal tights.LLOYDMrs. Christmas... Mary Christmas... Mrs.
          Mary Christmas. You

know, it has kind of a ring to it, oesn't it, Har?HARRYSounds nice, Lloyd, but don't you
          think you may be jumping the gun a
          little? I mean, who knows, when you
          get to know her, you may find out
          she's not your type.LLOYDImpossible. I know my type    when I
          see it. Now let me get this    straight,
          she wants me to meet her at    the
          Avalanche Bar and Grill on    Main
          Street?HARRYThat's what she said. Ten o'clock
          sharp.

This is when Lloyd notices Harry's get-up.93.LLOYDTime out. Where are going ressed
          like that.HARRYI, uh, thought while you were making
          your love connection I'd try my luck
          on the slopes.LLOYDYou mean you're gonna go out in public
          dressed in tights?HARRYThese aren't tights. They're
          fashionable Euro-trash ski trousers.LLOYDBut you can see the outline of your
          who-who.

Harry looks down at his crotch.HARRYReally?LLOYDTurn sideways.

Harry turns his profile against the window.LLOYD (CONT'D)Actually, it's just a tiny little
          lump. No one will ever notice.HARRYYou're right. I can't go out dressed
          like this.CUT TO:EXT. ASPEN BASE LODGE - DAYESTABLISHING SHOT of the building.INT. ASPEN BASE LODGEPeople are putting their boots on and their skis are lined
up on the wall behind them. Mary is waiting by the fireplace
in an incredibly sexy snowsuit.94.Suddenly Harry appears in the room, dressed ridiculously. As
he begins to clumsily make his way through the lodge toward
Mary, we see that he ALREADY HAS HIS SKIS ON. He kicks over
a row of skis and gets glares from all sides. Finally he
reaches her, OUT OF BREATH.HARRYSorry I'm late. It's a bitch driving
          a clutch with these things.EXT. CHAIR LIFT - DAYHarry and Mary are at the front of the lift line. The couple
ahead of them get on a chair, and then they shuffle into
position. Harry crouches nervously, waiting for the chair.
The chair swings around, comes up behind them, and makes a
smooth pick up of Mary, that is. An embarrassed Harry is
STILL IN THE CROUCHING POSITION, having missed the ride.
Mary looks back at him, confused. Suddenly he pretends to be
stretching.HARRY(CALLING OUT)You take the first run alone. I'm
          gonna loosen up down here.CUT TO:INT. AVALANCHE BAR & GRILL - DAYLloyd ENTERS the bar as the WAITERS are setting up for the
day.WAITERI'm sorry, we don't open until eleven.
This is disconcerting news to Lloyd.LLOYDI'm meeting someone. Mind if I wait
          at the bar?

The Waiter shrugs and Lloyd sits down at the empty bar.CUT TO:EXT. CHAIR LIFT - DAYHarry and Mary are now sitting together on a chair as it
rises higher and higher toward the imposing mountain top.
Harry holds onto the chair's frame nervously.MARYBeautiful day, huh, Harry?95.HARRYGlorious.

Mary takes a DEEP BREATH.MARYGod, it feels so good to get up here.
          I haven't been outdoors much in the
          last couple of weeks.HARRYWhy not?MARY(evasive)
          There's been... family problems. I
          on't want to bore you with them.HARRYThanks.

He looks mindlessly off in the distance. Then Harry notices
a PATCH OF FROST on the chair lift bar.HARRY (CONT'D)Oh, look... frost.

He licks it and his TONGUE IMMEDIATELY FUSES WITH THE FROZEN
METAL. He tugs a few times, but it won't budge.MARYAre you okay?HARRY(lisping)
          Sure. I do this all the time...CUT TO:EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP - DAYAs Mary and Harry arrive at the top of the lift, Mary
disembarks but Harry stays on.HARRY(lisping)

Harry and the chair lift swing around and start heading down
the hill.CUT TO:96.EXT. BOTTOM OF MOUNTAIN - DAYThe chair lift comes back around with Harry still sitting on
it, stuck to the bar. Two LITTLE KIDS climb on with him.HARRY(lisping)
