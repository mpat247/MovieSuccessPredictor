               record.DANNYDaniel Ocean.VOICE (O.S.)Thank you. Mr. Ocean, the purpose
               of this meeting is to determine
               whether, if released, you are
               likely to break the law again.
               While this was your first
               conviction, you have been
               implicated, though never charged,
               in over a dozen other confidence
               schemes and frauds. What can you
               tell us about this?DANNYAs you say, ma'am, I was never
               charged.2   INT. PAROLE BOARD HEARING ROOM - WIDER VIEW - MORNING         2Three PAROLE BOARD MEMBERS sit opposite Danny, behind a
    table.BOARD MEMBER #2Mr. Ocean, what we're trying to
               find out is: was there a reason
               you chose to commit this crime, or
               was there a reason why you simply
               got caught this time?DANNYMy wife left me. I was upset.    I
               got into a self-destructive
               pattern.(CONTINUED)OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01                                 2.2   CONTINUED:                                                     2BOARD MEMBER #3If released, is it likely you
                 would fall back into a similar
                 pattern?DANNYShe already left me once. I don't
                 think she'll do it again just for
                 kicks.

CHANGING CUBICLE                                         4Danny pulls on civilian clothes and there's not a bare
     thread among them. He tugs his cuffs and smiles: The
     old skin feels good. One last item to don: a silver
     wedding band. Danny considers it. Will he put it on?5    EXT. MINIMUM-SECURITY PRISON - FRONT GATE - AFTERNOON         5A sign reads: "NEW JERSEY STATE MINIMUM-SECURITY
     CORRECTIONAL FACILITY." Someone has graffitied below it:
     "If you were in prison, you'd be home now."

     The great metal door opens, and Danny stands within its
     frame, ready for release. (If it matters -- and if you
     notice -- he's wearing his wedding ring.)

     He hovers   there for a moment, on the precipice of
     freedom.    The WIND WHISTLES a little on the other side of
     the gate,   and the view ahead is not pleasant (New
     Jersey):    Life is hard out there.

     But Danny musters his courage, then takes his first step
     into free America...A6   EXT. ATLANTIC CITY BOARDWALK - DUSK                           A6Any empty wintery boardwalk.6    INT. CASINO (ATLANTIC CITY) - NIGHT                           6... And his wingtip lands squarely on plush red
     carpeting.

     As we PULL UP TO Danny's face and SPIN AROUND him, we
     hear, then see the BUZZ of a CASINO floor: the HUM of
     CONVERSATION, the DING-DING-DING and THUNK-THUNK-THUNK
     from the SLOTS, the brisk WHIR of SHUFFLED CARDS.

     And to Danny, it's a hearth and fire and a comfy chair
     and a snifter of brandy. He's home.ON DANNY'S WALLETAs he pulls out several crisp one hundreds, sets them on
     green felt, then sees them replaced by a neat pile of
     chips.4.7   AT BLACKJACK TABLE                                            7Danny cranes his neck about the casino, looking for
    someone -- a friend, somebody who should be here -- but
    without success. He turns his attention back to his
    cards, and the cards of the dealer.

    Nine-ten. Stay. Dealer -- seventeen. Danny wins.
    King-four. Dealer shows a six. Stick. Dealer busts.
    Queen-ace. Twenty-one. Danny wins again.

    A second dealer relieves the first, and Danny recognizes
    him with a smile -- this wasn't the friend he was
    scouting for, but two hours out of the joint any familiar
    face is welcome.DANNYHello, Frank.

    The new dealer (FRANK CATTON) glances up at Danny, and
    his eyes go wide, like a priest who's discovered he's
    dealing communion wafers to the pontiff himself. He
    quickly hides his astonishment.FRANKI beg your pardon, sir. You must
              have me confused with someone
              else. My name is Ramon. See?

    He taps the name embroidered on his vest, although he is
    the most African-looking Ramon you've ever seen. A pit
    boss circles close by and glares at them both.DANNYMy mistake...

    visible) woman on his arm. The second: scowling former

     man in a frayed jacket: LINUS.

     Two overgroomed STOCKBROKERS stand with their backs to
     the young man, yammering about high interest yields, and
     consequently they don't notice (and neither do we, not at
     first) that Linus is slowly picking one of their pockets.

     The thievery is glacier-paced: Linus, his face always
     forward and inscrutable, gingerly raises one tail of his
     target's Brooks Brothers jacket and then, with
     incomparable dexterity, unbuttons his wallet pocket with
     a flick of his thumb and forefinger.

     From halfway down the train car, nothing appears amiss,
     and no passenger looks the wiser. Or so it seems...

     A copy of the Chicago Sun-Times, opened and upheld,
     lowers just enough to allow its reader a peek at Linus.
     It is Danny, smirk on his lips: He (and he alone) is
     aware of the ongoing heist.

     Back to Linus, his spoils (a Gucci wallet) now in sight,
     but he waits for just the right moment, and then, when
     the train hits another curve...

     the Stockbroker's shoulder as his right relieves the man
     of his wallet.LINUSSorry 'bout that.STOCKBROKERNo problem, guy.

     He dodges and sidesteps crazed commuters, and except for
     a brief brush with one well-dressed man (the Sun-Times

     Linus considers. He looks down at the ticket, then at
     the wallet. It's one or the other.

     A waitress passes, and Danny signals her for his bill.

       glass vacuum tube the size of a small refrigerator.BASHER (V.O.)A pinch is the equivalent of a
                    cardiac arrest for any broad-band
                    electrical circuitry. Or better
                    yet: A pinch is a bomb... but
                    without the bomb. Every time a
                    nuclear weapon detonates, it
                    unleashes an electromagnetic pulse
                    which shuts down any power source
                    within its vicinity. That tends
                    not to matter in most cases
                    because the nuclear weapon
                    destroys everything you might need
                    power for anyway. Now a pinch
                    creates a similar electromagnetic
                    pulse, but without the headache of
                    mass destruction and death. So

      An EMPLOYEE from the charter airline sticks his head out
      of his office door.EMPLOYEE(innocently)

      Half-a-dozen firearms turn and point in his direction.
      The Employee disappears back inside his office.

      The Head Goon cautiously approaches the van, reaches for
      the driver's door, and yanks it open...

      Inside: There is no driver. Just a video camera mounted
      at eye-level. The Head Goon cranes back his head,
      befuddled, when he notices for the first time (and maybe
      we do, too) an enormous antenna sprouting from the van's
      rear bumper.

      replica of the one Virgil Malloy used in the monster
      truck drag race against his brother.

      And Virgil's using it now, too, as he sits next to Reuben
      Tishkoff in one of Reuben's Rolls and watches the Goons
      scramble back from the flat-tired van.TISHKOFFEnough monkey business.

      Knocked on his ass, the Head Goon watches as the canvas
