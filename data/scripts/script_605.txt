             Will Dormer.  Tall, handsome, expensively tailored suit.
             Snakeskin cowboy boots.  There's both a magnetism and a
             distance to him.  An intense mixture.  Hap glances at him.HAPNothing wrong with smelling the roses.

             Will looks up.  We see the trace of a thick, ropy SCAR by his
             Adam's apple.  There's tension between him and Hap, just
             below the surface.  He taps the file.WILLTell that to her, partner.ANGLE ON THE FILEa stack of 8x10 PHOTOGRAPHS.  Of the dead girl.  Her eyes

             Will nods.  The plane lurches.  The file falls to the floor
             and the photographs scatter.  The pilot catches a glimpse of

             A mud-splattered Jeep Cherokee pulls up next to it.  Brakes

             BANG!  He stumbles back.  Hit in the gut.

             Will's Smith and Wesson, smoking.  No longer jammed.

             Walter, touches the blood.  Looks back at Will.  Staggering.
             CRACK!  The rotting floor gives way beneath him.  He CRIES
             out, falls.  Drops into the icy water below.

             SILENCE.  Will steps over to the hole.  Looks down atWALTER, floating on his back.  Looking up at him.  Water
             washing over his body.  Eyes, pleading.  Fading.  A wave,
             gently pulls him away.WILLAnother J. Brody mystery.EXT. BOATHOUSEWill staggers out on to the dock.  Drops his gun.  Crashes to
             his knees.  Falls back.  His face, pale.  Lying against the
             wood of the dock.

             RAIN DROPS.  Start to fall.  Washing the blood from his skin.
             Puckering the lake water.  Will's eyes...flutter...

             FOOTSTEPS...running along the dock.  Heavy boots...ELLIE (O.S.)Detective Dormer!

             Will squints against the rain.  Makes out the face of

             ELLIE hovering over him.  He gives a half-smile.WILLGod, you're a pain in the ass.

             Ellie kneels down next to him.  Pulls over her vest.  Covers
             him.ELLIEYou're shot.

             Will looks at her bloody shoulder.WILLYou, too.

             Ellie, tearing off her boot.  Yanks off her sock.ELLIEI'm going to make a tourniquet.

             Will, fading fast.WILLWalter Byrd killed Kay Connell.  Her
                       things are in the house.ELLIEI know.WILLByrd's dead.

             Ellie, wraps the sock around his leg.  Starts twisting.  Will
             grimaces.  Ellie swallows.  Doesn't want to ask this.ELLIEYou shot Detective Eckhart, didn't you?

             Will nods.WILLYes.

             A pained looks crosses Ellie's face.ELLIEDid you mean to?

             Will shakes his head.WILLNo.  But I covered it up.  I lied.ELLIEWhy?

             RAIN, drumming down around them.  Will, takes a deep breath.WILLBecause I just couldn't be wrong.

                       Don't ever get that way, Ellie.  Don't 
                       ever lose your way.  It blurs the line.

             His blood, pumping out in rivulets.  Ellie looks down at him. 
             Her hero.  Moves up to the wound in his arm.ELLIEThis one looks worse.

             Will reaches up a feeble hand.  Stops her.WILL(whispers)
                       Just let me sleep, Ellie...

             His eyelids, growing heavy.

                       Let me sleep.

             Ellie blinks away the tears.  Knows what he means.  What he
             wants.  Watches as the calm spreads over him.

             Will closes his eyes.ELLIENo!

             Will opens his eyes.  She ties the second sock around his
             arm.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       I will not let you sleep.  If you've lost
                       your way then you have to make it right.
                       That's the only way.  That's what you'd
                       tell me.  I've been a detective for four
                       weeks and I say you're coming with me.

             She gets up.  Slips her arms under his shoulders.  Starts
             hoisting him up.

                                 ELLIE (cont'd)
                       C'mon...

             Will.  Struggling to his knees.  Every inch of him, screaming
             in pain.  Gets to his feet.  Arm slung around this tiny,
             young woman.WILLWhat about your shoulder?ELLIEDon't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.

             And they head, slowly but surely, back down the dock.FADE OUT.
