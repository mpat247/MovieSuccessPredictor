	A CLOCK reads twenty to six.

	A SHELF OF BOOKS holds such classics as Dante's Inferno,
	Beyond Good and Evil, The Catcher in the Rye, and The Dark
	Knight Returns. A FRAMED DIPLOMA, dusty and unkempt, hangs
	askew on the wall. A snapshot of a girl is stuck in the
	corner, and a bra weighs one end down. A PHONE sits quietly
	atop a bundle of laundry. It suddenly explodes with a
	resounding ring-once, twice, three times. A CLOSET DOOR
	swings open, and a half-clad figure falls out. THE PHONE
	rings yet again, and a hand falls upon the receiver, yanking
	it off the trash can, O.C. THE RUMPLED FIGURE lays with his
	back to the camera, phone in hand.FIGURE(groggily)
		Hello...What?...No, I don't work
		today...I'm playing hockey at two.

	THE DOG yawns and shakes its head.FIGURE (O.C.)Why don't you call Randal?...
		Because I'm fucking tired....I just
		closed last night....
			(deep sigh)
		Jesus...What time are you going to
		come in?...Twelve...Be there be
		twelve?...Swear...

	A PICTURE OF A GIRL leans against a trophy. The picture is
	decorated with a Play-Doh beard and mustache.FIGURE (O.C.)Swear you'll be in by twelve and
		I'll do it....Twelve...Twelve or I
		walk.

	THE PHONE RECEIVER slams into the cradle. THE RUMPLED FIGURE
	slowly sits up and remains motionless. He musses his hair
	and stands.

	THE DOG stands and wags its tail. A hand pats its head. The
	Rumpled Figure lays down on the bed. We now see his face. It
	is the face of DANTE and this is Dante's room; this is
	Dante's life. DANTE grabs the dog and wrestles it.DANTENext time, I get the bed.2.He releases the dog and sits up.DANTE(exhausted)
		Shit.CUT TO:INT: BATHROOM. MINUTES LATERA steaming shower fills the room. The dog licks water from
	the toilet.CUT TO:INT: KITCHEN. MINUTES LATERA towel-dressed DANTE opens the fridge and peers inside. He
	grabs a half-empty gallon of milk and closes the door.CUT TO:INT: KITCHEN. SECONDS LATERChocolate milk mix is heaped into a tumbler. One scoop, two
	scoops, three scoops, four scoops.CUT TO:INT: BEDROOM. A MINUTE LATERDANTE gulps his breakfast while feeling inside the closet
	for some clothes. Some chocolate milk spills on the floor.
	THE DOG laps at the small puddle of chocolate milk.CUT TO:INT: HALLWAY. MINUTES LATERDANTE'S feet are hastily covered. A hand grabs keys from
	atop a VCR.CUT TO:EXT: DRIVEWAY. MINUTES LATERA car backs out of the driveway and speeds down the street.CUT TO:3.EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNINGThe car pulls up, with a screech. Feet descend to the ground
	from the open door. Keys jam into a lock and pop it open.CUT TO:DANTE lifts the metal shutter revealing the door. He opens
	it and grabs two bundles of papers, throwing them inside the
	store.CUT TO:INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNINGA very dark room barely lit by the daylight. Suddenly, the
	lights flick on, revealing the glorious interior of the
	convenience store. THE CAT looks at DANTE as he passes the
	camera quickly. THE PAPER BUNDLE is snapped open with a
	knife. Newspapers slam into the appropriate racks. One rack
	remains empty. A coffee filter is placed in a metal pot.
	Ground coffee follows, and the mix is shoved into place in
	the coffeemaker. The switch is flicked and the machine comes
	to life. The empty newspaper rack with the heading ASBURY
	PARK PRESS seems out of place among all the other stacks of
	papers. DANTE rubs his chin and stares, puzzled. He rolls
	his eyes as it occurs to him.DANTEShit.

	The register pops open, and a hand extracts a quarter.CUT TO:EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNINGPOV: NEWSPAPER MACHINEThrough murky glass and thin metal grating, we see DANTE
	approach. He stops and drops a quarter in the slot. He pulls
	the door down, finally allowing us a clear view as he
	reaches toward the camera.

	DANTE pulls a stack of newspapers from the Asbury Park Press
	vending machine. He struggles to hold them all in one hand
	as he lets the door slam shut. He turns to walk away, but
	the sound of the quarter dropping into the change slot stops
	him. He takes a step back to grab the coin.CUT TO:4.INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNINGThe papers drop into the once-empty rack with a resounding
	flop. The quarter drops back into the register drawer.CUT TO:EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNINGDANTE tries to jam the key into the window shutter lock. He
	looks down at it.DANTEShit!

	The lock is gummed up with gum or something hard and
	obtrusive like gum, preventing the key from being inserted.
	DANTE looks around and kicks the shutter angrily. The car
	trunk pops open and a hand reaches inside, pulling out a
	folded white sheet.CUT TO:INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNINGA can of shoe polish is grabbed from the shelf. DANTE dips
	his fingers into the shoe polish and writes large letters on
	the unfurled sheet, leaning on the cooler.CUT TO:EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNINGDANTE stands on a garbage can and tucks a corner of the
	sheet under the awning. He jumps down. The banner reads I
	ASSURE YOU, WE'RE OPEN. The door sign shifts from CLOSED toOPEN.CUT TO:INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNINGThe clock reads 6:20. DANTE leans behind the counter, the
	morning routine completed. He stares ahead, catatonic, then
	drops his head in his hands. The day has begun.CUT TO:EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAYThe store, with its makeshift banner looming in the dim
	morning hour, just after dawn. A car drives by.CUT TO:5.INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAYDANTE waits on a customer (ACTIVIST) buying coffee.DANTEThanks. Have a good one.ACTIVISTDo you mind if I drink this here?DANTESure. Go ahead.

	The ACTIVIST leans on a briefcase and drinks his coffee.
	Another CUSTOMER leans in the door.CUSTOMERAre you open?DANTEYeah.CUSTOMERPack of cigarettes.ACTIVISTAre you sure?CUSTOMERAm I sure?ACTIVISTAre you sure?CUSTOMERAm I sure about what?ACTIVISTDo you really want to buy those

		What is this, a poll?DANTEBeats me.6.ACTIVISTHow long have you been a smoker?CUSTOMERSince I was thirteen.

	The ACTIVIST lifts his briefcase onto the counter. He opens
	it and extracts a sickly-looking lung model.ACTIVISTI'd say you're about nineteen,
		twenty, am I right?CUSTOMERWhat the hell is that?ACTIVISTThat's your lung. By this time,
		your lung looks like this.CUSTOMERYou're shittin' me.ACTIVISTYou think I'm shitting you...

	The ACTIVIST hands him something from the briefcase.CUSTOMERWhat's this?ACTIVISTIt's a trach ring. It's what they
		install in your throat when throat
		cancer takes your voice box. This
		one came out of a sixty-year-old man.CUSTOMER(drops ring)
		Unnhh!ACTIVIST(picks up the ring)
		He smoked until the day he died.
		Used to put the cigarette in this
		thing and smoke it that way.DANTEExcuse me, but...7.ACTIVISTThis is where you're heading. A
		cruddy lung, smoking through a hole
		in your throat. Do you really want
		that?CUSTOMERWell, if it's already too late...ACTIVISTIt's never too late. Give those
		cigarettes back now, and buy some

		it certainly beats this.

	Hands him a picture.CUSTOMERJesus!ACTIVISTIt's a picture of a cancer-ridden
		lung. Keep it.CUSTOMER(to DANTE)
		I'll just take the gum.DANTEFifty-five.ACTIVISTYou've made a wise choice. Keep up

		What's that?ACTIVISTThis? How long have you been smoking?CUT TO:EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAYA blank wall. JAY steps into the frame, followed by SILENT
	BOB. JAY pulls off his coat and swings it into the arms of
	SILENT BOB. JAY then throws down with a makeshift slam
	dance, spinning his arm and fake-hitting SILENT BOB.JAYWE NEED SOME TITS AND ASS! YEAH!SILENT BOB lights a smoke.JAYI feel good today, Silent Bob.
		We're gonna make some money! And
		then you know what we're going to
		do? We're going to go to that party
		and get some pussy! I'm gonna fuck

			(Blue Velvet Hopper)I'LL FUCK ANYTHING THAT MOVES!SILENT BOB points to something off-screen.JAY(to O.C.)
		What you looking at?! I'll kick
		your fucking ass!
			(to SILENT BOB)
		Doesn't that motherfucker still owe
		me ten bucks?

	SILENT BOB nods.9.JAYTonight, you and me are going off

		his fucking soul! Remind me if he
		tries to buy something from us, to

	Some girls walk past. JAY smiles at them.JAYWa sup sluts?
			(to SILENT BOB)
		Damn Silent Bob! You one rude
		motherfucker! But you're cute as
		hell.
			(slowly drops to knees)
		I wanna go down on you, and suckle
		you.
			(makes blow job neck-jerks)
		And then, I wanna line up three
		more guys, and make like a circus
		seal...

	JAY makes blow job faces down an imaginary line of guys,
	looking quite like a performing seal. He throws a little
	humming sound behind each nod. He then hops up quickly.JAYEwwww!  You fucking faggot! I
		fucking hate guys!
			(yelling)I LOVE WOMEN!(calmer)
		Neh.

	A GUY comes up to them.GUYYou selling?JAY(all business)
		I got hits, hash, weed, and later
		on I'll have 'shrooms. We take
		cash, or stolen MasterCard and Visa.CUT TO:INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAYA SMALL CROWD gathers around the ACTIVIST as he orates. It
	has become something of a rally.10.ACTIVISTYou're spending what? Twenty,
		thirty dollars a week on cigarettes.LISTENER 1Forty.LISTENER 2Fifty-three.ACTIVISTFifty-three dollars. Would you pay
		someone that much money every week
		to kill you? Because that's what
		you're doing now, by paying for the
		so-called privilege to smoke!LISTENER 3We all gotta go sometime...ACTIVISTIt's that kind of mentality that
		allows this cancer-producing
		industry to thrive. Of course we're
		all going to die someday, but do we
		have to pay for it? Do we have to
		actually throw hard-earned dollars
		on a counter and say, "Please,
		please, Mister Merchant of Death,
		sir; please sell me something that
		will give me bad breath, stink up
		my clothes, and fry my lungs."LISTENER 1It's not that easy to quit.ACTIVISTOf course it's not; not when you
		have people like this mindless
		cretin so happy and willing to sell
		you nails for your coffin!DANTEHey, now wait a sec...ACTIVISTNow he's going to launch into his
		rap about how he's just doing his
		job; following orders.(MORE)11.ACTIVIST (CONT'D)Friends, let me tell you about
		another bunch of hate mongers that
		were just following orders: they
		were called Nazis, and they
		practically wiped a nation of
		people from the Earth...just like
		cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette
		smoking is the new Holocaust, and
		those that partake in the practice
		of smoking or sell the wares that
		promote it are the Nazis of the
		nineties! He doesn't care how many
		people die from it! He smiles as
		you pay for your cancer sticks and
		says, "Have a nice day."DANTEI think you'd better leave now.ACTIVISTYou want me to leave? Why? Because
		somebody is telling it like it is?
		Somebody's giving these fine people
		a wake-up call?!DANTEYou're loitering in here, and
		causing a disturbance.ACTIVISTYou're the disturbance, pal! And
		here...
			(slaps a dollar on
			the counter)
		I'm buying some...what's
		this?...Chewlie's Gum. There. I'm
		no longer loitering. I'm a customer,
		a customer engaged in a discussion
		with other customers.LISTENER 2(to DANTE)
		Yeah, now shut up so he can speak!ACTIVISTOh, he's scared now! He sees the
		threat we present! He smells the
		changes coming, and the loss of
		sales when the nonsmokers finally
		demand satisfaction. We demand the
		right to breathe cleaner air!12.LISTENER 3Yeah!ACTIVISTWe'd rather chew our gum than
		embrace slow death! Let's abolish
		this heinous practice of sucking
		poison, and if it means ruffling
		the feathers of a convenience store
		idiot, then so be it!DANTEThat's it, everybody out.ACTIVISTWe're not moving! We have a right,
		a constitutional right, to assemble
		and be heard!DANTEYeah, but not in here.ACTIVISTWhat better place than this? To
		stamp it out, you gotta start at
		the source!DANTELike I'm responsible for all the
		smokers!ACTIVISTThe ones in this town, yes! You
		encourage their growth, their habit.
		You're the source in this area, and
		we're going to shut you down for
		good! For good, cancer-merchant!

	The small crowd begins to chant and jeer in DANTE's face.CROWDCancer merchant! Cancer merchant!
		Cancer merchant!

	VERONICA enters and surveys the mess. The CROWD throws
	cigarettes at DANTE, pelting him in the face. Suddenly, a
	loud blast is heard, and white powder explodes over the
	throng. Everyone turns to face...

	VERONICA as she stands in one of the freezer cases, holding
	a fire extinguisher.VERONICAWho's leading this mob?13.The CROWD looks among themselves. Someone points to O.C.SOMEONEThat guy.

	The ACTIVIST carries his briefcase surreptitiously toward
	the door.VERONICA (O.C.)Freeze.

	VERONICA jumps off the freezer case, training the nozzle of
	the extinguisher on the ACTIVIST.VERONICALet's see some credentials.

	He reaches into his briefcase. She pokes the extinguisher
	nozzle at him, warningly.VERONICASlowly...

	He pulls out a business card and hands it to her. She reads
	it.VERONICAYou're a Chewlie's Gum
		representative?

	He nods.VERONICAAnd you're stirring up all this
		antismoking sentiment
		to...what?...sell more gum?

	He nods again.VERONICA(through gritted teeth)
		Get out of here.

	He quickly flees. She blasts him with more chemical as he
	exits.VERONICA(to the crowd)
		And you people: Don't you have jobs
		to go to? Get out of here and go
		commute.

	The CROWD sheepishly exits, one by one, offering apologetic
	glances. DANTE tries to regain his composure.14.VERONICA watches the crowd disperse, disgusted.VERONICAYou oughta be ashamed of yourselves.
		Easily led automatons. Try thinking
		for yourself before you pelt and
		innocent man with cigarettes.

	The last of the crowd exits. VERONICA sets the fire
	extinguisher down next to DANTE. DANTE is sitting on the
	floor, head in his folded arms.VERONICAIt looked like Tiananmen Square in
		here for a second.

	DANTE is silent.VERONICA"Thank you, Veronica; you saved me
		from an extremely ugly mob scene."

	DANTE remains silent.VERONICA(sits beside him)
		Okay, champ. What's wrong?

	DANTE lifts his head and shoots her a disgusted look.VERONICAAll right, stupid question. But
		don't you think you're taking this
		a bit too hard?DANTEToo hard?! I don't have enough
		indignities in my life-people start
		throwing cigarettes at me!VERONICAAt least they weren't lit.DANTEI hate this fucking place.VERONICAThen quit. You should be going to
		school anyway...DANTEPlease, Veronica. Last thing I need
		is a lecture at this point.15.VERONICAAll I'm saying is that if you're
		unhappy you should leave.DANTEI'm not even supposed to be here
		today!VERONICAI know. I stopped by your house and
		your mom said you left at like six
		or something.DANTEThe guy got sick and couldn't come
		in.VERONICADon't you have a hockey game at two?DANTEYes! And I'm going to play like
		shit because I didn't get a good
		night's sleep!VERONICAWhy did you agree to come in then?DANTEI'm only here until twelve, then
		I'm gone. The boss is coming in.VERONICAWhy don't you open the shutters and
		get some sunlight in here?DANTESomebody jammed the locks with gum.VERONICAYou're kidding.DANTEBunch of savages in this town.VERONICAYou look bushed. What time did you
		get to bed?DANTEI don't know-like two-thirty, three.VERONICAWhat were you doing up so late?16.DANTE(skirting)
		Hunhh? Nothing.VERONICA(persistent)
		What were you doing?DANTENothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with
		you now?VERONICAWho's fighting? Why are you so
		defensive?DANTEWho's defensive? Just...Would you
		just hug me?! All right? Your
		boyfriend was accosted by an angry
		mob, and he needs to be hugged.

	She stares at him.DANTEWhat? What is that?VERONICAShe called you, didn't she?DANTEOh, be real! Would you...Would you
		please hug me? I just went through
		a very traumatic experience and I
		haven't been having the best day so
		far. Now come on.

	VERONICA stares at him.DANTEWhat? What's with that look?! I
		wasn't talking to anyone, especially
		her! Look at you, being all sort
		of...I don't know...stand-offish.

	VERONICA looks away.DANTEFine. You don't trust me, don't hug
		me. I see how it is. All right
		Pissy-pants, you just go on being
		suspicious and quiet. I don't even
		want to hug you at this point.17.VERONICA looks back at him.DANTE(pleadingly)
		Give you a dollar?CUT TO:INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAYA NOTE on the counter next to a small pile of money reads:PLEASE LEAVE MONEY ON THE COUNTER. TAKE CHANGE WHENAPPLICABLE. BE HONEST.DANTE and VERONICA are slumped on the floor, behind the
	counter. VERONICA holds DANTE in her arms, his head on her
	chest. Change is heard hitting the counter.DANTE(to O.C. customer)
		Thanks.

	The door is heard opening and closing-a customer leaving.VERONICAHow much money did you leave up
		there?DANTELike three dollars in mixed change
		and a couple of singles. People
		only get the paper of coffee this
		time of morning.VERONICAYou're trusting.DANTEWhy do you say that?VERONICAHow do you know they're taking the
		right amount of change? Or even
		paying for what they take?DANTETheoretically, people see money on
		the counter and nobody around, they
		think they're being watched.VERONICAHonesty through paranoia. Why do
		you smell like shoe polish?18.DANTEI had to use shoe polish to make
		that sign. The smell won't come off.VERONICADo you think anyone can see us down
		here?DANTEWhy? You wanna have sex or something?VERONICA(sarcastic)
		Ooh! Can we?!DANTEReally?VERONICAI was kidding.DANTEYeah, right. You can't get enough
		of me.VERONICATypically male point of view.DANTEHow do you figure?VERONICAYou show some bedroom proficiency,
		and you think you're gods. What
		about what we do for you?DANTEWomen? Women, as lovers, are all
		basically the same: they just have
		to be there.VERONICA"Be there?"DANTEMaking a male climax is not all
		that challenging: insert somewhere
		close and preferably moist; thrust;
		repeat.VERONICAHow flattering.19.DANTENow, making a woman cum...therein
		lies a challenge.VERONICAOh, you think so?DANTEA girl makes a guy cum, it's
		standard. A guy makes a girl cum,
		it's talent.VERONICAAnd I actually date you?DANTESomething wrong?VERONICAI'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan,
		it takes more than that to get a
		guy off. Just "being there"-as you
		put it-is not enough.DANTEI touched a nerve.VERONICAI'm astonished to hear you
		trivialize my role in our sex life.DANTEIt wasn't directed at you. I was
		making a broad generalization.VERONICAYou were making a generalization
		about "broads!"DANTEThese are my opinions based on my
		experiences with the few women who
		were good enough to sleep with me.VERONICAHow many?DANTEHow many what?VERONICAHow many girls have you slept with?20.DANTEHow many different girls? Didn't we
		already have this discussion once?VERONICAWe might have; I don't remember.

		me?VERONICAThree.DANTEThree?VERONICAThree including you.21.DANTEYou've only had sex with three
		different people?VERONICAI'm not the pig you are.DANTEWho?VERONICAYou!DANTENo; who were the three, besides me?VERONICAJohn Franson and Rob Stanslyk.DANTE(with true admiration)
		Wow. That's great. That's something
		to be proud of.VERONICAI am. And that's why you should
		feel like a pig. You men make me
		sick. You'll sleep with anything
		that says yes.DANTEAnimal, vegetable, or mineral.VERONICAVegetable meaning paraplegic.DANTEThey put up the least amount of
		struggle.VERONICAAfter dropping a bombshell like
		that, you owe me. Big.DANTEAll right. Name it.VERONICAI want you to come with me on Monday.DANTEWhere?22.VERONICATo school. There's a seminar about
		getting back into a scholastic
		program after a lapse in enrollment.DANTECan't we ever have a discussion
		without that coming up?VERONICAIt's important to me, Dante. You
		have so much potential that just
		goes to waste in this pit. I wish
		you'd go back to school.DANTEJesus, would you stop? You make my
		head hurt when you talk about this.

	VERONICA stands, letting DANTE'S head hit the floor.DANTEShit! Why are we getting up?VERONICAUnlike you, I have a class in
		forty-five minutes.

	A handsome young man (WILLAM) is standing at the counter.
	VERONICA reacts to him.VERONICA(surprised)

	A moment of silence as DANTE'S chuckles fade to comprehension.DANTEYou sucked that guy's dick?VERONICAYeah. How do you think I know he
		liked...DANTE(panicky)
		But...but you said you only had sex
		with three guys! You never mentioned

		him!DANTEYou sucked his dick!VERONICAWe went out a few times. We didn't
		have sex, but we fooled around.DANTE(massive panic attack)
		Oh my God! Why did you tell me you
		only slept with three guys?VERONICABecause I did only sleep with three
		guys! That doesn't mean I didn't
		just go with people.25.DANTEOh my God-I feel so nauseous...VERONICAI'm sorry, Dante. I thought you
		understood.DANTEI did understand! I understand that
		you slept with three different

		how many girls you fucked.DANTEThis is different. This is important.
		How many?!

	She counts silently, using fingers as marks. DANTE waits on
	a customer in the interim. VERONICA stops counting.DANTEWell...?VERONICA(half-mumbled)

	DANTE chases VERONICA down and grabs her by the door.DANTEHey! Where are you going?!VERONICAHey listen, jerk! Until today you
		never even knew how many guys I'd
		slept with, because you never even
		asked. And then you act all

		clerk serving the public, I wouldn't
		be allowed to spit a mouthful of
		water at that guy. But I did, so my

		out of this fucking dump and go
		back to school, to take charge of
		your life and find direction. I
		even transferred so maybe you would
		be more inclined to go back to
		college if I was with you. Everyone
		said it was a stupid move, but I
		didn't care because I loved you and
		wanted to see you pull yourself out
		of this senseless funk you've been
		in since that whore dumped you, oh

		snake out of doing what you wanted
		to do. Well, I won't let you. I
		want you to follow through on this,

	Hands clasp around his throat and yank him out of the frame.

	throws his fists into DANTE'S midriff, throwing him back
	into the magazine rack. RANDAL jumps to his feet as DANTE
	comes at him again. RANDAL tumbles into the cakes as
	Entenman's products scatter beneath and around him. He grabs
	a pound cake and hits DANTE in the head with it, using the
	opportunity to scurry down the middle aisle. DANTE leaps at
	his feet, and RANDAL grabs the shelves, knocking aspirin
	over until RANDAL-shrieking-sprays something in DANTE'S face.
