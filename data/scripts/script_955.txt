	She pays for an order of pork bao; as she takes her first
	bite we see:THE EXPLOSION BEHIND HERTWO OFFICES ON THE SIXTH FLOOR BLOWN OUT - a huge fireball
	erupting over one side of the embassy.

	People panic and run.  Hu Li doesn't even flinch.  She takes

	a man sings Karaoke -- the most painful rendition of Michael
	Jackson's "DON'T STOP 'TILL YOU GET ENOUGH."LEEI'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. 
		They don't like tourists in here, so try

	Lee walks off, trying not to be seen as Carter steps up to
	the bar, takes a seat next to TWO CHINESE THUGS.CARTERHow you boys doing tonight?

	The thugs ignore Carter as he motions to the stage, where the
	OLD MAN continues to sing.CARTER (CONT'D)That is the worst singing I've ever

	Before Lee can react, Carter has lifted Lee's badge and gun. 
	Carter bounds back on stage, pulls the plug on the music and
	fires three SHOTS into the ceiling, silencing the bar.CARTER (CONT'D)(Chinese)

	Reluctantly, Lee gets on stage.  More looks from the Chinese
	as Carter speaks, Lee translating.CARTER (CONT'D)Okay, all the Triads and ugly women go
		to that side, all fine ass women on this
		side.

	Nobody moves.  Carter fires two more shots in the ceiling.CARTER (CONT'D)Let's try this again.  Who here knows

	Nobody moves.CARTER (CONT'D)Who here is named Lee?  Raise your hand.

	Nobody moves.CARTER (CONT'D)Now I know you're lying.  

	The crowd still hasn't moved.  Except in the back, where Lee

	GANGSTERS look around frantically.  An apartment building is
	under CONSTRUCTION, massive BAMBOO SCAFFOLDING top to bottom. 
	Their only way out is UP.

	Lee and Carter dash around the corner to see the gangsters
	SWARMING UP THE SCAFFOLDING.  Lee wastes no time going after
	them.  With a running start, he JAMS A FOOT on the wall and
	VAULTS to the BOTTOM RUNG, GRABS HOLD AND SWINGS UP.CARTERHang on, Lee.  I'm coming.

	Carter jumps to grab hold of the scaffolding.  NOT EVEN
	CLOSE.  He backs up -- he's gonna take a running start!

	ABOVE - LEE REACHES 4 GANGSTERS.  They all tear off the
	LENGTHS OF BAMBOO and square off.  The clatter of wood
	against wood as they beat at each other.  Wrestling over his
	pole, Lee FLINGS TWO of the GANGSTERS over the edge.

	BELOW, Carter has hold of the bottom rung, STRAINING MIGHTILY
	to pull himself up.  Just as he gets his chin above the
	bar... snap!  It BREAKS and he drops.  Then...

	WHAM!  WHAM!  The two gangsters CRASH LAND ON EITHER side of
	CARTER.  HE takes one look at their pain.CARTER (CONT'D)Forget this...

	He dashes into the stairwell.  ABOVE, the last two GANGSTERS
	come at Lee.  He stomps down, levering up floor boards, which
	SEE-SAWS them off-balance.  With the advantage, he BATTERS
	them with his bamboo pole and knocks them off.  He climbs
	after the GANGSTER LEADER.

	Carter goes to the edge and sees Lee hanging on a pole below. 
	Carter is blind-sided by Hu Li.

	She takes one sultry step towards him, then twists her heel
	and WINDMILLS a HARD KICK that sends Carter FLYING OFF THEROOF!He falls along the side of the building.  He manages to grab
	the end of a BAMBOO POLE that juts out from the scaffolding.LEE IS RIGHT THERE NEXT TO HIM!They're hanging side-by-side, holding on for their lives.  Hu
	Li looks down at them.  She has no weapon to finish them off. 
	She turns and runs, disappearing in the night.CARTER AND LEEholding on with all their strength.  The bamboo is starting

	Lee may be a big rusty, but he puts on a shit-kicking move

	the glow...

	...until he sees Master Fu's disappointment.MASTER FU (CONT'D)Didn't I teach you to always arch your
		back?LEE(bowing, humbled)
		Yes, Master.

	While Lee follows Master Fu, Carter stands in front of the 12
	YEAR OLDS, who sit motionless around a fighting circle. 

	Carter starts stretching his legs, warming up.CARTERI was watching you kids.  My name is
		Carter, LAPD, and I'm a third degree

	The kids still don't move.  Carter, working up a sweat from
	shadow fighting, takes off his JACKET, DRAPING IT over the
	HOLY BUDDHA behind him -- a mistake.  He swings back around
	to face the kids and NEVER SEES THE KICK that sends him
	flying back onto the mat.  He looks around and sees ALL of

	In the b.g., we see the kids leaping acrobatically over
	Carter from all sides.  Carter, frustrated, tries to grab the
	kids out of the air as they fly by, but they elude him.  They
	disappear O.S.

	TOPS.  Carter is enjoying a hand and neck massage at the same
	time.  A WOMAN walks over and hands them each a drink.CARTERNow I'm on vacation.  I knew you'd come

	LEE doesn't respond.  LEE IS STARING AT SOMEONE ON THE FAR

	As Tan starts to exit, Lee and Carter move to intercept him. 
	But they are blocked by TAN'S MEN.

	Lee grabs one of the men's towels and pulls it off.  The man
	covers his naked body.  Lee is grabbed by one of the other
	henchmen, but he escapes and begins kicking ass, using the
	towel and his own robe to block and wrap another man's arms --
	blocking, kicking, and punching everything in sight -- all
	the while managing to keep his privates covered with a towel,
	his robe, or some other found object.

	Carter, meanwhile, uses his quick hands to send several men
	flying back -- grabbing a towel of one of them.CARTER(ref: his privates)

	Carter uses the towel like Lee did to block and trap one of
	the men's punches.

	flinches to cover himself and is punched from behind.

		village in China hired a young Dragon to
		guard their treasure in a cave, hoping
		to scare off potential bandits.  Their
		plan worked quite well, until the people
		of the village started sneaking the
		Dragon extra food -- hoping to make him
		bigger and stronger.  The Dragon ate so
		much and grew so big -- that he
		eventually got stuck inside the cave --
		and the treasure was stuck behind him
		for all eternity.
