DOGMAEXT ASBURY PARK BOARDWALK - DAYJersey spring day. Beyond the wooden planks that make up the aged fun pier,
the ocean waves crash into the sandy shoreline.

An OLD MAN stares at the empty beach. Sun-worshipers hours away from
besmirching the dunes. His features are simple. He wears an old overcoat.
His face belies good years gone by - a face that has seen more sunrises
than one would suspect. He inhales the crisp, salty air and lets a small,
satisfied smile cross his face.

Behind him. a large arcade with steel shuttered doors sits on the
boardwalk. Three young boys skate around by on roller blades, passing a
street hockey ball between them proficiently. The Old Man views them
briefly. checks his watch, and looks back toward the ocean.

The skates of the three hockey playing youths skid to a halt. We pan up to
their faces - now cold and dispassionate. They look at one another and nod.

Their skates glide out of frame.

P.O.V. SKATERS - The Old Man leans on the railing that overlooks the beach.
We get closer and closer to him until...

One of the skaters checks him hard into the railing. The Old Man exhales
violently and falls to his knees. The two other skaters begin savagely
beating on him with their hockey sticks, as he crumbles beneath them.
Repeatedly their blades crash down hard on his head.OC VOICEI don't understand - how can you base your lack of belief in God on the
writings Lewis Caroll?

The three skaters cease their beating and check the Old Man's pulse.
Satisfied, they skate away, leaving his crumpled form on the boardwalk.INT AIRPORT - DAYLOKI walks beside a NUN in a semi-busy terminal. They pass through the
metal detectors. The Nun carries a donation can.LOKILeaving 'Alice in Wonderland' aside, look closely at 'Through the Looking
Glass' - particularly 'The Walrus and the Carpenter' poem: what's the
metaphorical meaning?NUNI wasn't aware there was one.LOKIOh, but there is - it colorfully details the sham that is organized
religion. The Walrus - with his girth and good-nature - obviously refers to
either the Buddha, or - with his tusks - the lovable Hindu elephant god,
Lord Ganesha. This takes care of the Eastern religions. The Carpenter is an
obvious reference to Jesus Christ, who was purportedly raised the son of a
carpenter. He represents the Western religions. And in the poem. what do
they do? They dupe all the oysters into followmg them. Then. when the
oysters collective guard is down. the Walrus and the Carpenter shuck and
devour the helpless creatures, en masse. I don't know what that says to
you, but to me it says that following faiths based on these mythological
figures insures the destruction of one's inner-being.

BARTLEBY sits amongst a row of seats by one of the arrival gates. He eats
popcorn and stares at...

A steady stream of TRAVELERS, exiting the gate, meeting lovedones, family.OC LOKIOrganized religion destroys who we are or who we can be by inhibiting our
actions and decisions out of fear of an intangible parent-figure who shakes
a finger at us from thousands of years ago and says "No, no!"

Bartleby smiles at the meet-and-greets, warmed. Loki saddles up beside him,
kneeling on one of the seats, facing the Nun.LOKI'Through the Looking Glass' - a children's tale? I think not.NUN(really dazed)

I've... I've never really thought about it like that...

(beat; shocked; off her cassock)

What have I been doing with my life...?'.LOKIDon't look back. Just get out there and taste life.

(off donation can)

Leave this for the unenlightened. Poverty is for the gullible - it's
another way the church is trying to control you. You take that money you've
been collecting for your parish reconstruction and go get yourself a nice
piece of ass. You deserve it.

The Nun nods at him, and saunters off, obviously grappling with something.
A passerby tries to stick money in her can, but she yanks it away. Loki
faces the proper direction in his seat and plops down beside the
still-transfixed Bartleby.BARTLEBY(looking OC)

Here's what I don't get about you: you know for a fact that there is a God.
You've been in his presence, he's talked to you personally. And yet I just
heard you claim to be an atheist.LOKIC'mon man - you know I don't believe any of that shit I was telling her. I
just like to fuck with the clergy; keep 'em on their toes. When her head
stops spinning, she'll be facing the way of the Just again. But oh. will
she have a bunch to confess.

(looks around)

Now here's what I don't get about you: why do you feel the need to come
here all the time?BARTLEBY(off travelers)

I like to watch. This is humanity at it's best. Look at them.

A reunited FAMILY share a group hug and move on, making way for two young
LOVERS to embrace and kiss passionately.OC BARTLEBYAll that tension, all that anger and mistrust, forgotten for one perfect
moment when they come off that plane. See those two? The guy doesn't even
know that the girl cheated on him while he was away.OC LOKIShe did?

Bartleby and Loki continue to watch the arrivals.BARTLEBYUh-huh. Twice. But it doesn't matter at this moment because they're both so
relieved to be with one another. I like that. I just wish they could all
feel that way more offen.LOKIMaybe if someone gave them free bags of peanuts more often they would. Now
what was so friggin' important that I had to miss cartoons this morning? If
it was to share in your half-assed obsessions with Hallmark moments, I'm
going to slug you.BARTLEBY(still looking OC)

You're never going to believe this: we're going home.LOKI(off Bartleby's popcorn)

Let me have some?BARTLEBY(pulls out envelope)

Look what somebody sent us in the mail.

(hands him a newspaper article and corn)LOKIDid you say we're going home?

"Cardinal Glick Cuts Ribbon on 'Catholicism - Wow!"

And?BARTLEBYKeep reading.LOKI(reads)

"Updating the church... television spots... Papal consent...

(to Bartleby)

Again - and?BARTLEBY(snatches article) Give me this

(getting up; reading)

"The Re-dedication of Saint Michael's Church on it's hundredth anniversary
is the kickoff of a new campaign that seeks to bring the Catholic Church
back into the mainstream. With a papal sanction, the archway entrance to
the centuryold, Jersey shore house of worship will serve as a passageway of
pleanry indulgence, which - according to Catholic beliefs - offers all who
pass through it's arches a morally clean slate."

(looks at Loki)

You still don't get it, do you?LOKINo, I don't get it. Are we leaving now?

They start walking.BARTLEBYIf you walk through the church's front door on the day of the Re-dedication
ceremony, your soul is wiped clean of any and all existing sin, moreso than
the sacrament of penance could ever offer. It's a plenary indulgence, man!
I don't know why I never thought of this before.LOKI(spits out chewed popcorn into trash can)

Sounds thin. Sounds like someone made it up.BARTLEBYIt's rarely employed, but it's legitimate. It has a papal sanction for
God's sake.LOKISo you're saying you and I can walk through this doorway and go back home?BARTLEBYNo - by passing through the doors, our sins are

forgiven. Then all we have to do is die...LOKIWait. wait, wait - Die? I don't want to die.

(chews popcorn)BARTLEBY(steps on conveyor belt)

You'd rather stay down here for a few more eons?LOKINo, but we don't even know if we can die. And what if we can, but this
archway thing doesn't pan out? What then? Hell? Fuck that.

(spits out chewed popcorn into napkin)BARTLEBYImpossible. If we cut off our wings and transubstantiate to complete human
form then we become mortal. And if we die with clean souls, there's no way
to keep us out. They have to let us in.LOKI(beat)

Who sent this thing?BARTLEBYI don't know. Somebody who's looking out for us,

I guess. Does it matter? All that matters is that

after all these years, we've found a loophole. He

can't keep us out anymore. And once we're back

in, I'm sure He'll just forgive and forget.

They pass the Nun. who leans against a wall, still dazed.LOKIYeah, but this plenary' indulgence thing is a church law, not Divine
Mandate. Church laws are fallible because they're created by man.BARTLEBYOne of the last sacred promises imparted to Peter the first Pope by the Son
of God before He left was "Whatever you hold true on earth..."LOKI" ...I'll hold true in Heaven."BARTLEBYSo if the Pope says it's so, God must adhere. It's dogmatic law.LOKI(beat; extends hand)

Let it never be said that your anal retentive attention to detail never
yielded positive results.BARTLEBY(accepts hand)

You can't be anal retentive if you don't have an anus.LOKIThere's just one thing I think I should do before we leave - something
that'Il get us back on His good side.BARTLEBYWhat's that?

Loki smiles and starts rifling through his pockets. He extracts a magazine
article.LOKIThis is something I've been dreaming about for five years now. Read.

The crumpled article displays a Barney-like gold-hued cow, alongside
various profit charts and text.OC BARTLEBY(reading)

"Mooby the Golden Calf- Creating an Empire Out of Simplicity."

Loki wipes his mouth and nods to the article.LOKII want to hit them.BARTLEBYAre you nuts?!

(crumples article)

We're mere days away from getting back, and you want to jeopardize it
because you have a soft spot for the good ol' days?!LOKIWhat better way to show I've repented than by resuming the position I
denied... thanks to you.BARTLEBYA killing spree is not going to make things better for us.LOKIWe're not talking about killing here. We're talking about Divine Justice.
We're talking about punishing the wicked, raining down fire and brimstone.
He's all about that. I just know he'd want this done.BARTLEBYThere hasn't been an Angel of Death since you quit. Doesn't that mean
anything to you? Besides, what if you're wrong?LOKIIf I'm wrong, it won't matter. Like you said - we pass through the arch and
we're forgiven anyway

They step up to an elevator and press the button.BARTLEBY(considering it)

Well... he does hate competition.

(reading article)

And this Mooby deninitely falls under that heading.LOKIThe church we have to go to is where?BARTLEBYNew ]ersey. The Rededication is in four days.

The doors open. They get on. Other people are inside as well.LOKIOur last four days on earth. If I had a dick, I'd go get laid. But we can
do the next best thing.BARTLEBYWhat's that?LOKILet's kill people.

A guy beside Loki reacts. Loki smiles at him as the elevator doors close.OPENING CREDITSBetween black cards with white credits there are shots of the OLD MAN from

For those of you who haven't been following the news, an unidentified

last Tuesday lies in critical but stable condition in one of that area's
hospitals. He lacks identification and police have had no luck in tracking
down any possible family. While he shows no signs of recovery, the
Arch-Bishop of the Trenton Diocese has disputed the state's decision to
remove the indigent man from life support systems, asking that Catholics
all over the country join in this protest against Euthanasia. And finally -
will whoever keeps parking in my spot, stop doing that. Thank you. Now,
please rise for the recession of faith. We believe in one God, the

out her gum. Bethany offers her an understanding smile.GIRLYou know, I've done this three times now; and each time the counselor tells
me I should be more careful in the future, I should show' some
responsibility. Gotta tell you, though - this is the first time the
counselor wasn't some ugly as hell old bitch. It's kind of hard to take
abortion advice from a woman who's too gross to get laid in the first
place.BETHANYI'm not here to lecture you - I'm here to make sure you really want to go
through with this.GIRLI'd rather go back to that night when my idiot bovfriend swore up and down

My first year in college. All through high school, I'd dated the same guy -
Walter Flanagan. We were really in love, right? So much so. that we decided
to go Carnegie Mellon together... that's this college in Pittsburgh. So
there we are -away at school, and there's suddenly no parents to worry
about anymore, so we're screwing like rabbits - just constanly doing it.
And I wound up getting pregnant. So he begs me to have it. He says we
should quit school and get married, and I'm telling him that that'lI screw
up our educations. We fought about it for a week - my arguement being there
was no rush to have kids, you know? We could always have a baby in a couple
of years - after school. So I got the abortion against his wishes... I
mean, what the hell - it was my body, right? After graduation, we got
married and immediately set about trying to have kids. We tried like hell
for the first six months, and... nothing. So I went to a gynocologist to
see if everything was okay on my end.

My uteran wall had this fissure. It seems that the doctor who performed the

The Girl's face says it all. Bethany takes a drag and continues.BETHANYSo there I am - devastated. And now I have to go home to break the news to
my husband who years before had begged me to have the baby - his baby. And
after I explain it to him through my tears, he sits on the couch and rubs
his eyes. And in the calmest, most rational voice I've ever heard anybody
use in my life, he asks me for a divorce. And I fought him, you know? I
tried to talk him out of it; told him there were alternatives - like we
could adopt. And all he said was he wanted a wife who could have his
children.GIRL(beat)

What happened?BETHANYHe remarried. He had two kids in two years with his new wife. We never
spoke again. And now I do this.GIRLThat's like... such a sad story.BETHANYI dated this guy a year or two ago - he was really into comic books. He
told me I had the stock superhero story -I wanted to prevent a wrong that

killing Christ. So where were you yesterday morning - a bunch of us went
out for brunch?BETHANYI went to church.LIZThat kills me. You and church. We work in a field that specializes in
pissing off the cloth and you add insult to injury by breaking bread with
them every week.BETHANYI sit there every Sunday and I feel nothing. I can remember sitting in
church when I was a kid and being moved - like everything meant something,
like I was important. And the stories of all these holy people were so
inspiring. Now I sit there and think about my checking, and what I'm going
to wear to work the next day.LIZSo then why do you still go?BETHANY(beat)

I had a girl in here once - 'bout fifteen. She told me that faith is like a
glass of water. When you're young, the glass is full, and it's easy to fill
up. But the older you get, the bigger the glass gets, and the same amount
of water doesn't fill the glass anymore. Periodically, the glass has to be
refilled.BETHANYA fifteen year old who came in here said that?LIZShe had gotten knocked up by her pastor.BETHANYJesus! See? A minister knocks up a teenager -isn't anyone afraid of the
Lord's wrath anymore?LIZThat would require faith, and that commodity lately seems reserved only for
the psychotic zealots that hang around outside.

floor board is heard. Bethany reacts, grabbing a bat from under her pillow.
She peers into the darkness, defensively wielding her bat.

Suddenly, the room explodes in flames. A huge fire that appears to be
shooting out from the floor ignites mere feet from Bethany's bed. Bethany
leaps back, taking a beat to stare, mesmerized. Looking closely, one can
see an anthropomorphic form standing in the blaze.VOICE(powerful; booming)BEHOLD THE METATRON - HERALD OF THE ALMIGHTY ANDVOICEOF THE ONE TRUE GOD!The Voice repeats itself. Bethany darts out of bed and dashes out of the

mid-sentence, she blasts the thing with the contents of the canister,
swirling the nozzle around to hit all the flames. The booming Voice
sputters and starts coughing, losing it's impressive edge. Bethany stops
squirting and turns on her bedside lamp.

A choking, drenched, and coughing androgynous figure in a suit waves her
away. The figure coughs up some of the extinguisher's contents and drops to
the floor, hacking. It is METATRON. Bethany stares, shocked.METATRON(between coughs)

(sips)BETHANYWait, wait, wait. Repeat that.METATRONDamn, this is good tequila?BETHANYThe first part.METATRON(spits into empty glass)

Details. Stop a couple of angels from entering and thus negating all
existence. God, I hate when people need it spelled out for them.BETHANYClarify that.METATRONThat's the problem with you people - you need every-thing clarified. No
leaps of faith whatsoever. Alright -vou want the whole secret origin? Here
goes: Back in the old days, God was vengeful and hot-tempered, and his
wrath was bore by the Angel of Death - name of Loki. When Sodom and
Gommorah were destroyed? That was Loki. When the waters wiped out
everything with the exception of Noah and his menagerie? That was Loki. And
he was good at what he did. But one day, he refused to bear God's wrath any
longer.BETHANYWhy?METATRONBecause he listened to his friend - a Grigori by the name of Bartleby.BETHANYGrigori?METATRONOne of the choirs of angels. They're called Watchers. Guess what they do?BETHANYSo they're like Guardian angels?METATRONExactly like that, but different. So one day, Loki's wiping out all the
first born of Egypt...BETHANYThe Tenth Plague.METATRONSee? Tell a person you're the Metatron and they stare at you blankiy;
mention something out of a Charlton Heston movie and they're suddenly
theology scholars. May I continue uninterrupted?

(Bethany nods)

So once he's done with the first born, Loki takes his friend Bartleby out
for a post-slaughter drink. And over many rounds, they get into this
discussion about whether or not murder in the name of God is okay. Now,
Bartleby can run circles around Loki intellectually, not to mention the
fact that Loki's more than half in the bag, and in the end, Bartleby
convinces Loki to quit his position and take a lesser one - one that
doesn't involve slaughter. So - very inebriated - Loki tells God he quits:
throws down his fiery sword, gives him the finger - which ruins it for the
rest of us. because from that day forward, God decreed that angels could no
longer imbibe alcohol. Hence all the spitting.BETHANYSounds reasonable.METATRONMaybe to you, but I'm a lush by nature.BETHANYI mean about the angel of Death's resignation.METATRONFor a liberal, yes, but this is the Angel of Death we're talking about. The
Angel of Death can't be a conscientious objector. The Angel of Death is
charged with meting out whatever justice God demands. So for their
insolence, God decreed that neither Loki nor Bartleby would ever be allowed
back into Paradise.BETHANYWere they sent to Hell?METATRONWorse. Wisconsin. For the entire span of human history. And when the world
ends, they'll sit outside the gates for eternity.BETHANYAnd what's this have to do with me?METATRONSomebody's clued them in to a loophole in Catholic dogma that would allow
them to reenter Heaven.BETHANYSo what? They beat the system. Good for them.METATRONIt's not that simple. If they get in, they will have reversed God's decree.
Now listen up because this part is very important: existence in all it's
form and splendor functions solely on one principle: God is infallible. To
prove God wrong would undo reality and everything that is. Up would become
down, black would become white, existence would become nothingness. In
essence - if they are allowed to enter that church, they'll unmake the
world.BETHANYAre these guys that bitter?METATRONNo, that's the stupid part: they have no idea what their actions will
result in. As far as they know, they're just going home. Isn't that sweet?BETHANYIf this is so major, why are you talking to me? Why doesn't God do
something?METATRONHe could. He could blink them out of existence, destroy that church, turn
them into plants. But He'd rather see you take care of this one personally.BETHANYWhy me?METATRONBecause of who you are.BETHANYAnd who am I?METATRONThe girl in the p.j.'s. Don't ask so many questions just serve your
purpose.BETHANYI'll pass.METATRONI beg your pardon?BETHANYWhen some asshole abortion doctor destroyed my uterus -where was God? When
my

husband decided he couldn't be with a wife that couldn't bear his children
- where was

God? Now all the sudden, after all these years of quiet noninvolvement in
my life, He

sends one of His lackey's my way who tells me I should save the world, and
as what -

some sort of test? To Hell with Him.METATRONDo yourself a favor Bethany - do the world a favor: let go of your petty
crap. It's served you precious little in the past, and it serves you even
less now when the fate of existence

hangs in the balance. Don't allow eons of history and life to get blinked
out of being just because you have a grudge against your creator.BETHANYA grudge? Do you know why I work in that clinic? It's my own private way of
saying

"fuck you" to God.METATRONAnd any other day I'd say that's your business and your life, and enjoy
yourself and goodnight. But this isn't about you - this is about eve~body.
So you lost the abiliry to make life. You're being offered the chance to
play mother to the world by acting like one and protecting it - saving it.

(swigs her drink and spits it out)

But I can't make you. You'll do what you will. However, if you should
decide to stop being selfish and accept your responsibility, you won't be
alone. You'll have support.BETHANYWhat, more angels?NIETATRONProphets - although they don't quite get it yet. You'll know them right
away - one speaks, the other listens. The one who speaks - and he will at
great lengths, whether you want him to or not - will make mention of
himself as a prophet. The other one won't say anything, but he'll be
helpful

just the same.

(looks at watch)

I have to go. You'll do what you will, but try to remember that we're
working in a time frame here.

Metatron moves to exit.BETHANY(beat)

Hey.

(Metatron turns)

You work for God.METATRONThey tell me it's God. If it's not, I'm going to be severely pissed - what
with all these years of bossing people around on his behalf and
expectorating perfectly good tequila.BETHANYWhat's he like? God?METATRON(thinks)

Lonely. But funny. He's got a great sense of humor.BETHANYI'll bet.METATRONLook at sex. Sex is funny. One time I asked him why you people had to look
so stupid while procreating. He said if you didn't, you'd do it all the
time, just for fun.BETHANYBut we do.METATRONI know. And you all look so damn stupid doing it. It kills us upstairs.BETHANYSex is a joke in Heaven?METATRONThe way I understand it, it's mostly a joke down here too.

And with that, Nietatron is gone. Bethany looks at her drink. A three-man
mariachi band surround her and begin playing Prince's 'Little Red
Corvette'.INT BETHANY'S BEDROOM - NIGHTBethany startles awake. The radio on her night-table plays 'Little Red
Corvette'. She lays back down.INT BETHANY'S OFFICE - DAYBethany sits at her desk, staring into space. A twenty-something girl
speaks, butBethany's not really listening. She's extremely preoccupied.INT CLINIC - NIGHTBethany shuts off the lights in the various rooms. She packs up her bag and
turns on the alarm.EXT CLINIC - NIGHTBethany exits and locks the door behind her. She starts walking.

As her feet tread lightly toward her car, three small shadows move toward
her.

Bethany throws her bag on her car roof and rumages through her purse for
her keys. She hears something and stops. Roller blades can be heard moving
slowly across the asphalt of the parking lot. Bethany turns quickly.

Nobody's there. She looks around, a bit peturbed.BETHANY(calling into the darkness)

God, what time do you people quit and go home?! Let's just save it for
tomorrow, alright?

There's no response. Then there's the noise of wood being tapped against
the ground. Bethany peers into the darkness, looking for the source.

Suddenly, a skater whips past her, slamming his stick into the back of her
knee. Bethany goes down. Another skater whips in and slashes at her, but
she ducks. The stick hits the car door above her. She rifles through her
purse madly until another skater whips by, dragging her purse away with his
stick. Bethany looks up.

The Stygian Triplets are lined up menacingly, a few feet from her. They tap
their hockey sticks in unison on the ground. Bethany jumps up and faces
them defensively. The Triplets emit an unholy shriek and charge at her.

And from out of nowhere, a large figure swoops down from above, landing on
the ground between Bethany and her menacers. The Triplets stop short and
regard the figure curiously. The large figure whips into a defensive
stance, Batman-style.

The Stygian Triplets look to one another. They shrug and charge anew.

From behind the rock-still large figure, a smaller figure leaps into the
streetlight, shrieking, flying through the air, busting into a flying kick.
He lands before the middle Triplet and open-palm punches him twice in the
face, grabbing his stick from the falling child's hand and tossing it into
the air behind him.

The stick sails through the night air and is snatched by the grip of the
large figure, who twirls it under his arm, and then back Out like a sai. He
swings it out before him, knocking the other two Triplets off balance. The
smaller figure back flips into the larger figure's arms and kicks his feet
into the faces of the two wobbling Triplets. They go down, and the smaller
figure leaps forward with a shriek, landing between the fallen pair, elbows
into their backs.

The flrst struck Triplet leaps out of the darkness at the large figure,
screaming something unholy. The large figure catches the kid by the throat
and quickly

head butts him, tossing him to the side. The large figure sways for a beat
and then shakes it off.

The small figure collects the hockey sticks and throws them into the
distance. He kicks at the falien Triplets as they scurry away.SMALL FIGURE(calling after them)GO BACK TO YOUR PAPER ROUTES, YOU PUNK FUCKS!(more to himself)

Snoogans.

The large figure saddles up beside the small figure. They look at one
another and shake hands.SMALL FIGUREDude, I know they were just kids, but we kicked their fucking asses!

Bethany stares, mystified. She grabs her purse from the ground.BETHANYWhere... where did you learn to do... that stuff?!SMALL FIGUREFrom this comic book some guys made about us. Long story.BETHANY(beat)

The figures turn into the light, revealing the faces of the heroes for the
first time - two very familiar faces.SMALL FIGURESay you'll offer us sex as a reward.BETHANYWho are you?

The large figure lights up a smoke. The small one extends his hand.SMALL FIGUREJay. And this is my business associate, Silent Bob.BIETHANYWell thank you for being out here so late... Come to think of it, what are

Wait, wait, wait - we just saved your ass, and you're just going to take

nods.

muffin down and brushes off her hands. Jay's feet are moving a mile a
minute.BETHANYAre you both from around here?JAYI'm hard as hell.BETHANYDo you live in the city?JAYDo you have a friend for Silent Bob, or are you going to do us both? If so,
I'm first. I hate sloppy seconds.BETHANYYou're a man of principle. Where do you come from?JAYWe used to live in a small town in Jersey. Real small town. We practically
knew everybody.BETHANYWhat brought you to McHenry?JAYHollywood.BETHANY(beat)

Hollywood?JAYOh yeah. See, we used to sell smoke in front of this video store. And one
day this fuck wants to rent a video. So we did, only we didn't have
anyplace to watch it. So we went to the mall and popped it into a VCR at
Macy's and sat on the floor and watched it. It was called 'Sixteen
Candles'. Did you ever see it?BETHANYYes.JAYSo the next day we rented 'The Breakfast Club', and then 'Weird Science'
where these two fucks have a chick that'll do anything for them and they
don't do nothing because it's a PG movie. But then we got thrown out of
Macy's when we watched 'Pretty in Pink', because of this bitch.

So what exactly brought you to Illinois?JAYOh yeah. See, all these movies take place in a town called Shermer, in
Illinois. And there's all this fine bush running around, and we could kick
all the dude's asses because they're all whiney pussies. Except Judd Nelson
- he was harsh. But best of all, there was no one selling weed. So I says
to Silent Bob "Man, we could live phat if we were the blunt-connection in
Shermer, Illinois!" So we collected some cash we were owed, and caught a
bus. But when we got here,

you know what we found Out? There is no Shermer in Illinois. What kind of
shit is that?! Fucking movies are bullshit!BETHANYAnd now you live here?JAYFuck that. This berg sucks. Everyone talks with a stupid accent so you

Dude, he's talking about your mom.

Jay turns to see that Silent Bob isn't there.

Silent Bob peers at a large bush at the road side. The bush rustles
slightly.OC BETHANYYou know, normally I'd have a hard time with this, but somehow you falling
out of the sky seems to go hand in glove with some of the other stuff I've
been deaiing with.OC RUFUSBelieve me - you ain't seen nothing yet.

Silent Bob peers closer at the bush. Suddenly - a Stygian Triplet leaps out
at him, pinning him to the ground with his hockey stick.

The other two Triplets leap on top of Jay and BETHANY

Rufus grabs the one off Bethany and hurls him to the side.

Jay manages to reach into his jacket and pull out a copy of Penthouse. He
rolls it up and starts beating the kid in the head with it.

Silent Bob gets his hands under the stick that pins him and pushes it up
hard, into the Triplet's forhead, knocking him off. He rushes to Jay's side
and plies the other Triplet from his throat, hurling him OC.

The Triplet Silent Bob fought 'punctures' the air with his stick and rips
downward, creating a 'hole'. He grabs his friend and leaps into it,
disappearing.

Jay and Silent Bob look at eachother, blink, and embrace passionately.

The Triplet that Rufus threw rushes Rufus from behind - hockey stick in
lancing position. Without looking back, Rufus reaches behind himself,
grabbing the stick and swinging it (and the Triplet) over his head in an
arch, letting go. The last Triplet goes sailing through the 'hole', and it
seals shut.

Bethany, Jay and Silent Bob are in various wide-eyed states of shock.JAYAlright - what's with you, lady?! That's the second time you got attacked
by the fucking Mighty Ducks!RUFUS(wiping off hands)

Man, they're onto you bad, already. I got here just in time.BETHANYHow can you be so composed? We were almost killed.RUFUSDeath is a worry of the living. The dead only worry about decay and
necrophiliacs.JAYSee! I told you he was the undead!RU FUSNot the undead, the dead. I died. Christ told me the secret to resurrection
once when we were at a wedding in Canna, but I got drunk and forgot it.BETHANY(incredulous)

Wait. wait, wait - Christ? You knew Christ?RUFUSKnew him? I saw him naked.BETHANYLet me guess - you're another angel?RUFUSNo, I'm a man - just like you and him.

(looks at Jay)

Well, maybe not like him. At least I was a man. Been dead for nearly two
thousand years. Here.

(pulls rolled up paper from behind his ear)JAYNo wonder he saw Jesus - homey's rockin' the ganj.BETHANY(unrollingit)

It's not a joint.

(looks at it)

I can't read this.RUFUSIt's Sanskiit. It says "Rufus - see you in two years. Jesus." Freaked me
out because he basically told me when my number was up. Took the flavor out
of the remaining years. Look, we gotta keep moving. If we stay in one place
long enough, those things are liable to come back. What say we continue
this discussion over something to eat?BETHANY(snaps)WAIT A SECOND!(inhales deeply)

I'm a rational woman, okay. All I want to know is where you, and those...
kids came from?!RUFUSThey came from Hell. I came from Heaven.

(walking away)

Let's start walking.JAYWalk? Do you know how far we are from anywhere?RUFUSBack in the old days with J.C., we walked everywhere. Did you ever hear of
a fat apostle?

(exits)

Bethany looks to Jay and Silent Bob for some guidance or stability.JAYWhat's an apostle?

Bethany shakes her head and exits. Jay and Silent Bob shrug at each other.EXT MOOBY CORP. BUILDING - DAWNA large office building in downtown Cleveland. The city. hasn't started up
yet. A pickup truck pulls curbside in front of the structure. Bartleby and
Loki jump out of the back and pat the side of the truck. offering waved
thank-you's to the driver. As the truck pulls away, Loki pulls out the
article and looks at it. He looks up at the building and nods to Bartleby,
smiling. They head toward the front doors.

INT QUAlNT SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAWN

A ringing phone is answered by the unseen figure in the chair. We move from
the seated Figure, passing by the dead bodies of the home's original
owners, and come to a stop on the bruised and worn Stygian Triplets seated
on a couch. They look scared.FIGUREHello?... No, they're not in right now... I'm the phone guy... I'll leave
them a message... Bye.

The Figure hangs up the phone and rises.FIGUREYou say the girl has already met the prophets?

The Stygian Triplets nod.FIGUREShe grows closer to learning her true identity. If that happens, our plan
is jeopardized. I can't afford to go into the field - that might compromise
us further. The best course of action is to insure that our parcel is not
found. And being that I can't even trust you enough to kill a girl, I'm
left with no choice but to seek outside assistance in guarding our package.

(sighs)

I'm going to have to summon the Golgothan.

The Figure exits. The Stygian Triplets register shock.EXT FAST FOOD JOINT - DAWNRufus - now wearing some funky new clothes - carries a tray of fast food to
an outdoor table. Sitting already are Bethany, Jay, and Silent Bob.RUFUS(off new clothes)

It's amazing the shit people throw out. Didn't I tell you I'd find some
threads?

A car full of teens whip past them.TEEN(yelling from passing car)GARBAGE PICKER!RUFUS(waves to them)

Thank you.

(to group)

What's that mean?JAYIt means they saw you pull that shit out of that dumpster.RUFUSSo it's a good thing, then.

(handing coat back to Silent Bob)

I appreciate the loan, brother. You can have this back.JAY(to Silent Bob)

Lucky you.RUFUS(off food)

Damn, I remember when all we used to have for breakfast was fish and goat's
milk. What do you call this shit?BETHANY(to Rufus)

Egg McMuffin. Now how about you start explaining some things to me.RUFUSLike what?BETHANYLike - for starters - who the hell are those kids that keep attacking me?RUFUSNasty little bastards called the Stygian Triplets. They're not really
related. When they were alive they were a trio of kids that snatched a
neighbor's toddler and smashed it's skull in - "just to see what it looked
like" I believe was their defense. They were killed in a car wreck on the
way to a detention center.BETHANYSo they're dead too?RUFUSYou'd be surprised how many dead people are just walking around - we're
stubborn bastards. Thing is, those kids are supposed to be in Hell. Which
means that someone wants you out of the picture so badly they're willing to
summon demons.BETHANYIs it those two angels I'm supposed to stop?RUFUSCouldn't be. They're not evil - they're just stupid.JAY(to Bethany)

Wait a minute - are you going to listen to this shit? We don't even know
who this guy is. For all you know, he's in with those fucks. They both
showed up at the same time.BETHANYI hate to say it - but he does have a point. How did you know where to find
us?RUFUSYou know what the dead do with most of their time? They watch the living.
Especially in the shower.JAY(to Silent Bob)

I can't wait to die.BETHANYAnd why are you watching me?RUFUSBecause you're the one who's going to help me get some changes made in that
book you all hold so much stock in.JAYHustler?RUFUSThe Bible.BETHANYWhat's your beef with the Bible?RUFUSI'm not in it.JAYNeither are any of us, but you don't hear us bitching.RUFUSBut I'm supposed to be in it. I was the Thirteenth Apostle.BETHANYI've been going to church my entire life and I've never heard of a
thirteenth apostle named Rufus.RUFUSSee? You know all about the other twelve Apostles -white boys, I might add.
But no mention of Rufus. And why? Cause I'm a black man. But that's just my
pet peeve. I mainly want to correct a major error that you people are
basing a faith on.BETHANYWhat's that?RUFUSJesus wasn't white; He was black.

Rufus bites into his sandwhich. Bethany, Jay and Silent Bob look at him and
then each other.JAYBullshit. I've seen pictures of Jesus, and He has blonde hair and blue
eyes.RUFUS(wiping hands)

That's what's particularly insulting. Between the time when He established
the faith and the church started to officially organize, the powers-that-be
decided that while the message of Christ was integral, the fact that He was
black was a detriment. So all renderings were ordered to be Eurocentric,
even though the brother was blacker than Jesse.BETHANYIf that's true, then why'd He get written about while you were left out?RUFUSWell He is the Son of God, right? It's kind of hard to have the New
Testament without him. So you fudge a few facts and put a spin on His
ethnicity. Leaving me out's okay because there's still Twelve apostles to
choose from.JAYI don't buy it.RUFUSThat's what the good people of Antioch were saying when they stoned my ass.BETHANYYou were martyred?RUFUSThat's one way of putting it. Another way is to say I was bludgeoned to
shit by big rocks. See - Christ told us Apostles to go out into the world
and spread His word. Antioch was already garnering a big Christian
following, so I got sent there. And was a big hit. They loved hearing about
Jesus' message, and how He was the Redeemer. But when I mentioned He was
black, the whole town turned on me - called me a liar and shit. I pressed
the point, and before I know it, I'm wearing stones - although not to
accessonze.BETH ANYWhy didn't you just let the point go when you saw how they were reacting?RUFUSBecause it's part of the facts. White folks only want to hear the good
shit: life eternal, a place in God's kingdom. As soon as they hear they're
getting all this from a black Jesus, they freak. And that - my friends - is
called Hypocrisy. Folks just can't accept a black Savior.

(to Silent Bob)

You going to eat that hash brown?BETHANYSo you went to Heaven?RUFUSShit yeah; it was the least the brother could do. I gave up my sheep and
followed His ass around Jerusalem for three years. And in all that time,
did I ever get laid? Hell no! But I didn't bitch, because I was into His
message. And while the message is what counts, folks should know that He
was black. That's why I'm going to help you find stop those angels from
getting to that church in exchange for you helping me with my campaign.BETHANYHow do you know about that?RUFUSHeaven's a pretty boring place, and anything that breaks the tedium is
news. The unmaking of existence is what you might consider a great
tediumbreaker. Besides, there isn't much I don't know about you.BETHANYI find that hard to believe.RUFUSWhen you were five you let a kid from next door piss on your hand.JAY(shocked)

You did that?BETHANYYeah... but I never told anyone about it.RUFUSNeither did he. He died of Leukemia two years later. His name was...BETHANY...BryanJohnson.RUFUSYour exploits - no matter how inane - are well-known in Heaven. Probably in
Hell, too.

Bethany rubs her temples and exits OC. Rufus watches her go.JAY(intrigued)

Tell me something about me.RUFUS(preoccupied with the OC Bethany)

You masturbate more than anybody else on the planet.JAYShit, everyone knows that. Tell me something nobody knows.RUFUSYou think about guys when you do it.

Rufus gets up and exits. Silent Bob looks at Jay, shocked.JAYNot all the time!

Bethany sits on a swing in the kiddie-jungle gym, shaking her head. Rufus
joins her.RUFUSI'm sorty if I spooked you.BETHANYI just feel... violated. Like my life isn't mine exclusively.RUFUSThat's the way it goes with celebrities.BETHANYWhat are you talking about? I'm a nobody. I'm just a quiet girl from the
suburbs who counsels pregnant teens.RUFUSYou sound like Christ. He had the same reaction when He found out who He
was, minus the quiet girl from the 'burbs angle. And like Him, I'm sure
you'll come to terms and do what you're supposed to.BETHANYWhy not get the pope or someone holy like that?RUFUSJust because a guy wears a funny hat, doesn't make him the right man for
the job. Only certain hands can deliver the world from the brink of
destruction. last time it was Jesus - this time it's you.BETHANYWhy me?RUFUSCan't say yet. But the question is - are your hands capable enough to carry
the burden. It all rides on you.BFTRANY(rubbing her temples)

Two thirds of me wants to forget about this and go home. You know,
yesterday I wasn't sure God even existed. And now I'm upto my ass in
Christian Mythology.RUFUSGod hates it when it's referred to as Mythology.BFTHANYWell then let's ask the quote, unquote 'prophets' what we should call it
instead.

(looking OC; concerned)

Now where did those two assholes go?INT STRIP JOINTIt's your typical strip club. One woman on a stage and a crowd of men
paying way-too-much attention. The place is dimly lit with red lights and
chock full of smoke. Off to one side, a dee-jay spins records, blasting the
music. The crowd is rather thin.

Jay and Silent Bob sit at the stage. their eyes glued on...

The DANCER - a gorgeous, shapely vixen with very little clothing on, and
growing littler by the second.

Jay pokes Silent Bob, who produces a wad of bills. They skim off a nice
pile and stow the rest. They spread their piles neatly on the bar. The
Dancer smiles and starts dancing toward them. Jay holds up a five-spot and
performs his own little seductive dance ~th it. He stands at the edge of
the stage, ~'rating. The Dancer slinks over and Jay stuffs the five in her
G-string. She rubs his head and slinks away. Jay humps Silent Bob's chair,
excitedly. Bethany and Rufus come up from behind them. Bethany hits Jay.BETHANY(shouting above the music)

What are you doing?JAYProving to this bastard that I ain't gay.BETHANYWhat?RUFUSLong story - forget it. But we should get moving. How can we get to New
Jersey?BETHANYI had a car.

She slaps Jay upside the head, but - riveted by the Dancer - he doesn't
feel it.BETHANY(to Rufus)

We could go by train.RUFUS(looking OC)

Sounds cool.BETHANYThere's a phone out there. I'll call for reservations.

Rufus is now also riveted by a table dancer off to the side.BETHANYNo, it's okay. I can handle it.

Rufus half-nods. Bethany shakes her head and exits.

The Dancer gyrates on the stage, revealing more and more of herself.

Jay pounds on the stage, hoots, and dances, flashing more bills.

ACROSS THE STAGE a small GANG of bandanna-wearing, angry-looking blacks
watch the OC Jay with little amusement. The Dancer dances toward them.JAY(banging on stage)

Sweet thing!

(Hashes another five)

Look what I found! Snoog!

The Dancer smiles as she approaches Jay, but is interrupted by more
banging.

The GANG LEADER has his foot on the stage. He produces a ten dollar bill
from his jacket and casually holds it up. The other three members of his
posse smile and slap hands.

The Dancer shrugs at the shocked Jay and changes direction, heading toward
the Gang. Jay casts a horrified look at Silent Bob.

The Gang Leader leans forward, preparing to tip when we hear an obnoxiously
loud throat~learing.

Jay holds aloft a twenty, smiling and nodding.

The Dancer shrugs at the Gang Leader and again switches direction. The Gang
Leader looks at his posse, who shake their heads at him, disappointedly.

The Stage becomes a bidding table, as - on one side - the Gang Leader
produces two twenties. On the other side, jay - staring at the Gang Leader
- produces three twenties. The Gang Leader hits his posse up for more cash.
Jay hits Silent Bob up for more cash. The Dancer stays in the middle,
gyrating and sizing up the best offer.

Jay then produces the creme'de Ia creme': three hundred dollar bills. He
sneers at the OC Gang Leader. The Dancer heads over to jay and wraps her
legs around him from the stage, gyrating against his groin. Jay stares at
the Gang Leader, a victorious smirk on his face.

The Gang Leader shakes his head angrily and jumps out of his seat,
producing a gun from his jacket. He fires into the ceiling. The music
scratches to a halt and the other viewers scatter toward the door. The Gang
Leader points his piece at Jay, his posse backing him up.GANG LEADERYou a smart ass, ain'tcha, white boy? Come in here and ruin my good time.JAYIt's a free country. The bitch just came to the man with the most.DANCERBitch?JAYNo offense, baby.GANG LEADERThe bitch is gonna be leaving with the man with the most - the man with the
most led in his piece. While you and tubby are leaving with the most led in
your dead fucking carcasses, know what I'm sayin?JAY(to Dancer)

Step to the side, baby. I've gotta slap this pussyass, Nino Brown wanna-be
down.DANCER(to Gang Leader)

Come on, Kane. This isn't necessary.GANG LEADERShut the fuck up and back away from the midget!

The Dancer moves to the side.GANG LEADER(to Jay)

Now I believe you were about to apologize. I believe you were about to
intone some pleas for mercy. You were about to say "Please, Mister Kane, I
didn't mean to disrespect you in your club. Please accept my most humble
apology.

Bethany comes back and sees the mess. She moves to rush to Jay's side, but
Rufus holds her back An OC Jay laughs.

Jay leans on Silent Bob, laughing. The Gang stares back, angrily.JAYYou want an apology?GANG LEADER(cocks gun)

Give me at least one "I'm sorry," and ltll put a kill shot through that
thick fucking skull of your's. Otherwise we go slow and long in the pain
dispensation.JAY(beat; zips jacket closed)

Know what I'm doing?GANG LEADERNo. What you doing?JAYI'm closing my jacket, so that when we start this up, I don't get your
filthy fucking brain guts all over my shirt. You know why?GANG LEADERWhy?JAYBecause you can't get shit stains out of flannel. What I'm saying is that
you got shit for brains.

The Gang Leader and his posse stare silently for a moment.GANG LEADERWell I appreciate you breaking that down for me, but I got it without the
explanation.JAYNo. No, I don't think you did get it. See, there's gonna he some nine's
firing in here, and when the bullets stop flyin', your cunt-lip ass is
gonna be all holes and smoke. You think you can draw on me and walk away?
Fuck that. And fuck you - you punk-ass monkey bitch! Yeah, I called you a
monkey! Maybe if you kiss my dick all nice before I cap you, I'll bring a
coconut to your funeral and lay it on your grave; stick a straw through it
and stick the other end in the ground. Your lips'll reach.

The Gang stares, mystified. Rufus and Bethany can't move they're so
frightened.JAYYou think every white boy cowers at your ass? Shit, if I don't fucking
plant you - watermelon - my muscle here will.

(thumbs at Silent Bob)

What do you think he is? My boy friend? I love chicks. So he's gotta be
with me for one reason: to watch my back. Silent Bob doesn't talk in words
- he speaks in bullets. Re's all quiet cause he's thinking about how he's
gonna take you and your bitches out quick enough to piss on the bullets in
your bodies before they cool down. You know why? Because he likes to see
the hot steam coming off them when he sprays them down. Come to think of
it, I~m tired of talking to your dumb ass; you probably don't even
understand big words like 'piss'. Tell you what - I'll let him explain it
to you.

(to Silent Bob)

Silent Bob - shoot these punk-monkey bitches.

Silent Bob slowly raises his hands in a surrender fashion. Jay looks at
him.JAYWhat are you waiting for?!

Silent Bob shrugs.JAY(flabbergasted)YOU DON'T RAVE A GUN?!?Silent Bob kind of nodsJAY(shocked)WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN? ALL THIS TIME WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER, AND YOU DON'THAVE A GUN?!?Silent Bob indicates the negative, sheepishly.JAYTHAT'S JUST FUCKING GREAT! DO YOU THINK IWOULD'VE SAID ALL THAT IF I'D KNOWN YOUDIDN'T HAVE A GUN?!?(beat)HUNHH?!?Silent Bob raises his eyebrows remorsefully. The Gang snickers and smiles.GANG LEADERWhat was that about a coconut?

Jay shakes his head and glowers at Silent Bob.JAYNo gun! What the fuck kind of muscle are you?! All this time and you got no
gun!GANG LEADEROh boys! We have some unfinished business here.JAY(sheepishly)

Can we talk this over?GANG LEADERTell you what - you got thirty seconds. Then I cap you. Talk all you like.

Bethany goes to make a move, but Rufus holds her back, shaking his head. He
puts a finger to his lips to quiet her and points back toward the action,
smiling.

Jay fumes.JAY(to Silent Bob)

I can't believe you.

(to Gang Leader)

Do me a favor.

(points to Silent Bob)

Shoot this piece of shit first.

(to Silent Bob; disgusted)

No gun!

Suddenly, they both snap into a momentary trance. Zombie-like, Jay and
Silent Bob step to the turntables behind them. Jay puts on headphones and
begins scratching a record. A familiar tune begins.

The Gang watches, perplexed.

Silent Bob whips around, microphone in his hand, and begins to sing.SILENT BOBHEY, HEY, HEY!!! IT'S FAT ALBERT!AND I'M GONNA SING A SONG FOR YOU!!AND BILL'S GONNA TELL YOU A THING OR TWO!!WE'LL HAVE SOME FUN, NOW!WITH BILL AND ALL THE GANG!LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER -WHILE WE DO OUR THANG!The Gang slowly goes from perplexity to enjoyment. The Gang Leader softens
and smiles, adding a slight nod of approval. Jay provides back-up.JAYNA , NA, NA! GON NA HAVE A GOOD TIME!SILENT BOB(as Fat Albert)HEY! HEY! HEY!JAYNA. NA. NA! GONNA HAVE A GOOD TIME!Bethany and Rufus look on. amazed.RUFUSI thought she looked familiar.BETHANYWho?RUFUS(he nods toward the stage)

Serendipity.

Bethany looks to the stage.

The Dancer is the SERENDIPITY in question. She wipes sweat from her brow.INT. MOOBY CORP. BOARDROOM - DAYOh, this isn't your standard boardroom; this is Mooby Corp., home of Mooby,
the Golden Calf - which can only be described as a bovine variation on
Barney: sickeningly simple and very non-threatening. A large table sits in
the middle, a media center behind the huge chair at the head. The walls are
adorned with framed posters of Mooby, playing with kids, mouth agape in a
stupid smile. At the center of the table is a large, gold plated statue of
the insipid creature.

Doors open and the boardroom fills with suits - six men, one woman. They
chatter and take their seats. After a beat, WHITLAND, the CEO, enters,
taking his place at the head of the conference table.WHITLANDGood morning, shoppers.

(slaps a file on table)

Has anyone seen the over-night's?

An anticipatory hush fills the room.WHITLANDWe creamed 'em.

A cheer and applause goes up from the group. Whitland smiles.WHITLAND(reading from file)

And last night was a rerun, which says to me that with the six months we
have to ready and promote the 'Very Nlooby Christmas' pay-per-view special,
we can produce history-making numbers. The record is held by that
shock-jock's New Year's thing, but I see no reason why our little cash cow
can't supercede those numbers and...

(stops and sniffs the air)

Do I smell onions?

Bartleby and Loki sit behind the thrall on a black leather couch. Loki is
carving something out of an onion, while Bartleby looks on.

Whitland and the rest of the board stare at them.WHITLANDI didn't realize we had guests. Who are these gentlemen with?

The other suits shrug and look to one another for an answer nobody has.WHITLAND(to Bartleby and Loki)

Excuse me.

Loki continues carving. Bartleby looks at his friend and shakes his head.
Loki lifts his head without looking up.LOKI(very distracted)

Hmm?WHITLANDMay I ask what you're doing in my boardroom?LOKI(still preoccupied)

My friend just has a few words for you, and then we'll be on our way.
Heading to Jersey, you see. Now -by the decor, I assume I'm guessing
correctly that this is the corporate headquarters for Mooby Productions
International?WHITLANDYou guess correctly. Now, may I ask who the fuck you are and - again - what
the fuck you're doing in our conference room?LOKI(to Bartleby, still not looking up)

You may proceed, mon ami'.BARTLEBYI can't believe you.

(to Whitland)

I just want to start off by apologizing. My friend here has a penchant
toward the dramatic, so he's making me do this. Usually, I don't even
involve myself in his affairs, but he hasn't done this in awhile, so he
wants...LOKI(frustrated)

Just read 'em their rights already.BARTLEBY(sighs; circling the table)

Mooby, the Golden Calf. Created by Nancy Goidruff -a former kindergarten
teacher - in nineteen eighty nine to fill a gap in the Saturday morning
schedule on local network K-REL Bought by the Complex Corporation in
nineteen ninety one and broadcast nationally as the 'The Mooby Fun-Time
Hour', it picked up a large following of children, ages three to eight, and
spawns sixteen records, two theatrical films, eight prime-time specials, a
library of priced-to-own video cassettes, and bicoastal theme parks dubbed
'MoobyWorld'.

(beat)

Did I miss anything?

Whitland and company stare for a beat.WHITLANDYou forgot 'Mooby Magazine'. Is there a point to this?BARTLEBY(grimly)

You and your board are idolators.

Whitland and company stare dumbfounded. Loki finishes carving and stands
beside Bartleby.LOKI(to Bartleby)

How could your forget the magazine?

Bartleby rolls his eyes. Loki turns to the Whitland and holds up the
sculpture.LOKIIt's you.

(sets sculpture on table)

Do you know much about voo-doo? Fascinating practice, very close to
Satanism, but not really much of a religion - no doctrine of faith. Just an
arrangements of superstitions, the most well- known of which is the voo-doo
doll.

(sneezes; waits; continues)

A mock-up of an individual is subjected to various pokes and prods, and the
desired result is that the individual will feel the effects.WHITLAND(to nearest board member)

Call security - now.

Loki throws the knife at the table, severing the phone cord.LOKIAll lines are currently down.BARTLEBY(to Whitland)

Again -. I apologize for my friend's...LOKI(frustrated)

Would you just get on with it?!BARTLEBY(miffed; to Whitland)

You are responsible for raising an icon that draws worship from the Lord.
You've broken the first commandment, but more than that, I'm afraid none of
you passes for a decent human being. Your continued existence is a mockery
of morality.

(looks to Loki; Loki nods)

Like you - Mister Bernard.

(stands behind board member)

Last year you cheated on your wife of seventeen years, eight times - twice
with prostitutes. You even had sex with her best friend while she was at
her garden club meeting and you were supposed to be watching your kids.LOKIIn the bed you and your wife share, no less.

The board member stares in disbelief. Loki nods to Bartleby and he moves
on.BARTLBYAnd you, Mister Newman.

Loki sifts through compact discs. He pulls out one entitled 'Mooby Mania'
and pops it into a player. A simple children's song echoes through the
room.BARTLEBYYou got your girlfriend drunk at last year's Christmas party, and then paid
a kid from the mailroom to have sex with her while she was passed out, just
so you could break up with her - guilt free - when she sobbingly confessed
the next morning that she cheated on you. She killed herself three months
later. You sent flowers to her wake.

The board member's face is frozen. Bartleby shakes his head and moves
quickly around the table.BARTLEBY(not liking his job)

Mister Pereira disowned his gay son; Mister Turran put his mother in a
third-rate nursing home and used the profits from the sale of her house to
purchase an oriental rug for himself; Mister Barker flew to the Phillipines
on the company account to have sex with an eleven year old boy; Mister
Bloom okayed the production of Mooby dolls from what he knew were unsafe
and toxic materials because it was less costly.

Bartleby stops at the female Board member and looks at her, relieved.BARTLEBYYou, on the other hand, are an innocent. You lead a good life and have
never misused your power here.

She stares at Bartleby. Loki pats her on the back and urges Bartleby on.BARTLEBYBut you, Mister Whitland. You have more skeletons in your closet than this
assembled party. I can't even mention them aloud.

Bartleby leans over and whispers something unheard into Whitland's ear.
Whitland goes green. Bartleby steps back. Loki stands beside Whitland.LOKIYou're her father, you sick fuck.

Whitland begins sobbing.BARTLEBY(to Loki)

Can I go now?LOKI(cheerily rubbing his head)

Go on, you crazy kid.

Bartlebv exits. Loki turns menacingly on the others.LOKIWith the exception of Miss Pryce, there is not a decent human being amongst
you. Do you know what makes a human being decent?

(beat)

Fear. And therein lies the problem. None of you has anything to fear
anymore. You rest comfortably in seats of inscrutable power, hiding behind
your false idol, far from judgement - lives shrouded in secrecy even from
one another. But not from God.

Loki goes to exit but pauses. He turns around.LOKII forgot my little voo-doo doll.

(looks at Whitland)

Wow. It really does look just like you. Maybe, if I believed enough...

Loki begins moaning menacingly, slowly waving an open palm over the figure.
Whitland looks at it horrified, then at Loki, then back at the figure. He
sweats and shifts in his seat - eyes pinned on the figure. Loki lets out a
shriek and smashes the figure with his fist. Whitland freezes, eyes closed.
Slowly, he opens his eyes - unharmed.LOKII don't believe in voo-doo.

Loki swiftly exits. The Board Members sit in awed silence. Then the doors
burst open and Loki storms back in.LOKIBut I do believe in this.

Gun blazing, he takes out the male board members, including Whitland, in a
flurry of bullets. The remaining female Board Member covers her head with
her arms. Loki hangs his arm at his side and touches her hair.LOKI(smiling)

It's okay. You've done nothing wrong. They were bad men. You are a pure
soul.

She looks at him, terrified. He smiles back. Then his expression hardens.LOKIBut you didn't say 'God Bless You' when I sneezed.

He quickly puts the gun to her head. She slams her eyes shut.OC BARTLEBY(cautionary)

Loki!

Loki freezes and looks OC. He grimaces and holsters his piece.LOKI(to woman)

Sorry. Force of habit.

He surveys his handiwork and exits. The female Board Member slowly opens
her eyes and looks around.INT STRIP JOINT - LATERJay and the Gang Leader sit together at a table, surrounded by the other

Bethany, Rufus, and Serendipity huddle around a table further away.RUFUS(elated)

I forgot you were down here! How long now?SERENDIPITYThree years this August. What about you - is this another temporary
expulsion? You and your 'Christ was down' campaign?BETHANYWhat does that mean - another expulsion? I thought you came down here
specifically to help me?SERENDIPITYIs that what he told you? Rufus gets thrown out constantly; at least once a
month, ethereal time. They always bring him back, but only after a few days
of peace and quiet - free from that black nationalist rhetoric.RUFUS(joking)

Artsy-fartsy bitch.SERENDIPITYWho you calling artsy-fartsy?RUFUS(to Bethany)

Serendipity here used to hang with us sometimes back in Jerusalem.BETHANYLet me guess - the fourteenth apostle; left out of the bible because she's
a woman.RUFUSThe girl's not a woman.

(to Serendipity)

No offense.BETHANYOh, those weren't tits I saw Jay cozying up to?SERENDIPITY(tugs on boobs)

What, these? You should know better than anyone at this table that tits
don't make a woman.RUFUSHell, the tubby, coat-wearing mother fucker's got tits - don't make him a
woman.SERENDIPITYAside from an intuitive knack for accessorizing, what traditionally defines
a woman falls between two things : her legs. But as you can see...

Serendipity stands and unbuttons her jeans, dropping them slightly,
revealing yet another smooth, sexless crotch, quite like Metatron's.SERENDIPITYI lack definition.OC JAYHey! They're getting a free show!

Serendipity pulls her pants back up and sits down, smiling at the OC party.BETHANY(weary)

Oh God. Another angel. Like Metatron.SERENDIPITYHow do you know Metatron?

How does she know Metatron?RUFUSThis is the last Scion.SERENDIPITY(beat)

A bit.

(suddenly nervous)

Oh shit. If she's been tapped, then something's up.BETHANYI'm confused.RUFUSBethany, Serendipity here isn't technically an angel, nor is she by any
means a human being like I was and you are.SERENDIPITYAmen to that.

(swigs her beer and spits it out)BETHANYThen who is she?SERENDIPITYNot who - what. I haven't always been part of the anthropomorphic club. I
used to be an abstract.BETHANYNow I'm really lost.RUFUSSerendipity's an idea.SERENDIPITYTry all ideas.BETHANYMeaning?SERENDIPITYI'm a muse, stupid.

Bethany stares at her for a beat, then at Rufus. Rufus nods affirmatively.BETHANYI can't take much more of this.

(downs her beer)RUFUS(to Serendipity)

She's now met a seraphim, a dead man, and a muse.

You can appreciate her frame of mind.BETHANY(to Serendipity)

So you - what - inspire people?SERENDIPITYWhat just went down with your friends over there-you don't think they
thought of that themselves? I knew Kane's weak spot for Fat Albert and
passed it along to the boys.RUFUSIf she hadn't interceded, they'd be chalk lines right now.BETHANYYou made them sing that song?SERENDIPITYI offered them a solution out of the hole they dug for themselves.
Thankfully, they took it.BETHANYAre you kidding? Those two are so dense, they wouldn't get a good idea if
it was given to them in a specially marked box.SERENDIPITYDense people are the most open to suggestion - it's vou so-called
intelligent folks that have a hard time accepting a good idea.RUFUSAin't that the truth.BETHANYProve it. Give me a good idea.SERENDIPITYIf I do, and you accept it, then you'll have confirmation that you are - as
you say - dense.BETHANY(beat)

Alright. So you're a muse. So what kind of people do you inspire - besides
stupid ones?SERENDIPITYI used to specialize in entertainment - literature, theatre, so forth.BETHANYMovies?SERENDIPITYIn some cases, I'd do everything but bang starlets on the casting couch.BETHANYWhat have I seen that you've been involved with?SERENDIPITYOff the top of my head - everything. Well almost everything. For example:
I'm responsible for nine of the ten top grossing films of all time.BETHANYNine?SERENDIPITYThe one about the kid, by himself in his house; burglars trying to get in
and he fights them off?

(Bethany nods)

I had nothing to do with that one. Somebody sold their soul to Satan to get
the grosses up on that piece of shit.RUFUSWhich brings us to the next logical question - what are you doing
stripping?SERENDIPITYWell you remember why I left, right?RUFUSYou were tired of doing all the work and getting none of the credit for
your ideas.SERENDIPITYAnd sick of watching incapable people take brilliant inspiration and turn
out real trash.

(to Bethany)

So I opted to quit being a muse and write for myself. I gave my two weeks
notice. got a body, fifty bucks, and got sent out into the world to make my
fortune.BETHANYSo what happened?SERENDIPITYWriter's block.RUFUSWriter's block?SERENDIPITYCan you believe it? Me - a muse, for God's sake! I sit down in front of the
typewriter, and what do I get? Nothing. Blank page. 1 can't even write a
grocery list.BETHANYWhat about what you did with Jay and Silent Bob? You inspired them.SERENDIPITYThat's the cosmic joke. I can give out a zillion and nine ideas a second,
but I can't keep any for myself. Her quirky sense of humor.BETHANYWhose?SERENDIPITYGod's.BETHANYYou're saying God's a woman.SERENDIPITYWas there ever a doubt in your mind?BETHANYThe possibility never presented itself. He's always referred to as a Him.SERENDIPITYI didn't write it that way My job stops at the idea stage. The person that
holds the pen adds their own perspective, and all the pen-holders were men.
One of the drawbacks to being intangible is that you have no say in the
editorial process.RUFUSAnother one's that you can't jerk off.SERENDIPITY(to Bethany)

See. these being male-dominated times, the Pharisees and High Priests felt
threatened by the idea of a woman lording over them and controlling their
fates. so they made sure that She became a He Doesn't stop with God - the
whole book is slanted and gender-biased: a woman's responsible for the
first sin, the fall of man, and the expulsion from Eden. a woman cuts
Sampson's coif of power, a woman asks for the head of John the Baptist.
Read that book again some time - women are painted as bigger antagonists
than the fucking Egyptians and Romans combined.BETHANY(stunned)

God is a woman...SERENDIPITYI don't know what the big surprise is - women are the only gender that can
create life, just like God created the universe. Who else but a mother
could have the infinite patience with impudent children that God has with
humanity. A woman can give birth to and nurture both sexes, so
psychologists theorize that women are the only gender both sexes can feel
completely comfortable with; and the faithful - both male and female - feel
at ease with God. In time of trial, our first instinct is to implore the
aid of the Almighty, just as when you're a child, the only person who can
make it all better is...BETHANY...mom. God, it makes sense.RUFUS(to Serendipity)

Shit, you still have a knack for words.SERENDIPITYNot really useful in my new line of work.RUFUSWhat about that? Why'd you choose stripping?SERENDIPITYIn an effort to create something artistic that I could claim as my own.
See, I've been able to fool myself into thinking this isn't stripping, it's
dancing; and at least dancing is artistic. But She won't even give me that
much - the way God designed dance, it's the only creative act which results
in no tangible product. Unlike paintings, poems, movies or most other arts
forms. when the dance is over, there's nothing to show for it - nothing to
save and enjoy... or sell.

(takes a drink)

Believe me, the irony wasn't lost on this muse.RUFUSHow long are you going to keep this up?SERENDIPITYBelieve me, I think about eating crow and going back to the grind from time
to time. But I'd hate to give Her the satisfaction of my playing the
prodigal. And it sucks because I can't stand being flesh anymore -
especially this halfway crap. Not only do I have to take care of the
aesthetic - the showers, the haircutting, the pit-shaving - but I can't
take advantage of the benefits - like getting laid or using my period as an
excuse not to get laid...

(conspiratorily to Bethany)

...the only true boon to having a period, from what I understand.RLFLSWell we could sure use your help. We need someone with good ideas. You
remember a couple of angels named Loki and Bartleby?SERENDIPITYSure - the angel of death and his squeamish pal with a conscience.RUFUSThey found a way back.SERENDIPITY(shocked)

God no. Not the plenary indulgence loop hole?BETHANYYou know about that?SERENDIPITYI always knew that thing was a bad idea. Leave it to the Catholics to
destroy existence.RUFUSBethany's Catholic.SERENDIPITYMy condolences.BETHANYWhat do you have against Catholics?SERENDIPITYEver been to a Catholic mass?BETHANYOnce or twice.SERENDIPITYIt's like bad sex - up, down, up, down, kneel, leave.

And the whole time you'd rather be watching t.v.

You people don't celebrate your faith - you mourn it.BETHANYSo if we're so wrong, then what's the right religion?SERENDIPITYWhen are you people going to learn? It's not about right or wrong - it's a
question of faith. It doesn't matter what you believe in - just that you
believe.

Jay and Silent Bob join them, wearing bandannas.JAYLook! They made me and Silent Bob part of the gang!

Suddenly, the doors behind them blast open, pouring light into the onc~im
room. A huge figure stands in the doorway, backlit and acting as a sepia
filter - the light and vapors surrounding him are brown.FIGURE(deep, gutteral hiss)

Not born... shit into existence.

The Gang charges OC, guns blazing, while we hold on the group. Suddenly,
the room is filled with screams and wet, slurpy noises. The group goes from
staring wide-eyed, to shielding themselves. The noise stops and Jay and
Silent Bob look up.

The Gang lay about NoMan in trashed, dead positions. They are covered in
murky, creamy crap - their wide, white eyes frozen in horror. NoMan scoops
a finger-full of muck off the leader and eats it, smiling.

Our heroes start backing up slowly, as to not be noticed.JAY(to Silent Bob)

I guess we're in charge of the gang now.BETHANYWhat the fuck happened?!?SERENDIPITYGo for the bar. We might have a few seconds - his short-term memory's for
shit.JAYSo's the rest of him.RUFUSNo chance of taking him down?SERENDIPITYGee. I don't know. Let's ask the gangstas.RUFUSYou're right; let's book.

They dash. NoMan snaps to attention and throws it's arm at them, launching
a huge glob of shit through the air.JAY(running; seeing it coming)SHIT!!!Everyone leaps behind the bar. The shit flies over them and slams against
the mirror above. Immediately, it stretches - Blob-like - over the entire
frame, and burns in an acidic fashion.

Jay stares, horrified.JAYNow that... is some powerful shit.

Serendipity pulls at the floor, yanking open a door.SERENDIPITYQuick! Get in!

Bethany, Rufus, jay and Silent Bob leap into the darkness. Serendipity
follows, pulling the door shut on top of them.INT BASEMENTOur heroes cower beneath the floor door.JAYWhat is that thing?SERENDIPITYYou ever hear of Golgotha?BETHANYSkull place. The hill where Christ was crucified.SERENDIPITY(peering above)

Yeah, well it wasn't just Christ up there - the Romans crucified everybody
on that hill. Ahd Christ excluded, they were all criminals - killers,
brigands, thieves, rapists. And whenever the crucified expired, their
bodies would naturally lose muscle control, spilling bowel and bladder in
the process. And the result is that walking pile of crap up there: the
Golgothan Shit-Demon - Hell's chief assassin. And he's here for you,
girlie.

Silent Bob stares at a crack in the doors. A milky drop of shit drips
through it.BETHANYWhat are we doing down here, then?. Any second now he'll be blasting
through that door!SERENDIPITYShit's brainless. If we can sit tight for a couple of minutes, he'll forget
what he came for.

Suddenly another drop falls. Then another. Then a steady stream. Silent Bob
taps Rufus and points. Rufus reacts.RUFUS(indicating trickling shit)

Looks like it's been taking memory training courses...SERENDIPITY(off trickle)JUMP!!!The five leap from their perch on the steps, just as the doors explode,
dumping a torrent of crap on the steps. The body of muck morphs into NoMan
anew. NoMan lumbers toward them. The group, attempting to gain their
bearings on the floor, crawls backwards. NoMan pulls a piece of himself
off, rolling it around in It's hands.SERENDIPITYIf anybody still remembers any prayers, I suggest you start whipping them
out.

Silent Bob stares wide-eyed up at the approaching demon. And then,
something occurs to him. He stops backing up and stands. The others
continue moving back.BETHANYBob, get down! Jay!JAY(to Silent Bob)

You tubby retard! Get your ass back on the floor!

Silent Bob stands like a statue in the Golgothan's path. The demon snarls a
smile, moving ever closer. Silent Bob reaches into his coat and pulls a
small canister out. He points it at the beast. A mist shoots out into the
face of the Golgothan. It pauses, looking confused. The shitball in It's
hand drops to the floor, and then so does It.

Bethany, Rufus, Serendipity, and Jay climb to their feet and crowd around
Silent Bob. They look to the fallen, unconscious behemoeth, then to Silent
Bob.BETHANY(off Bob's canister)

What was that?

Silent Bob holds the can out to them: it's a small, trial size can of Glade
Air Freshener. Jay looks at it, then at Silent Bob.BETHANY(reading can)

'Knocks strong odors out.'RUFUSWay to go. tubby.BETHANYWhy would you ever carrs this?

Jay farts. Silent Bob sprays the freshener at his ass. The others look at
jay.JAYWhat?!RUFUS(to Serendipity)

Who has dominion over this thing?SERENDIPITYOnly Lucifer can order a killing. But something doesn't make sense: this
thing never travels alone - with it's intelligence level, Lucifer'd never
allow it. It usually has some kind of backup.RUFUSCan you get some answers?SERENDIPITYI can give it a shot.BETHANYWhat's going on?RUFUSSerendipity's going to talk to that demon.JAYCool! Can we watch?SERENDIPITYNot a good idea. Demon's can wreak havoc on the weak-minded.JAYFuck you - weak-minded! Me and Silent Bob can talk to him in his own
language! See...?

do.BETHANYShe told me that if you behave, she'll give you head.JAY(excited)

ladies and gentlemen of the press, I give you the driving force behind the
movement - Cardinal Glick.

The reporters clap as CARDINAL GLICK takes to the podium. He strikes one as
more of an agent than a man of the cloth as he removes his Wayfarers.GLICKThank you, Mister Flanagan - one of this parish's chief patrons, who
donated the stained-glass likeness of Our Lady of Gleeful Misery that
welcomes you as you enter the church every Sunday.

(off index cards)

Ladies and Gentlemen of the press - few would deny that the Catholic Church
has fallen behind somewhat in the times. Catholicism usually strikes the
average person as an old-fashioned remedy for the ills - both moral and
psychological - of a society that has since left it's stringent rules and
ornate rituals on the heap with 45's and eight track cassettes. And in an
effort to disprove that, the Church has appointed this year as a time of
renewal, both of faith and of style. So, it is with great pleasure, that I
present you and your parish - mere days away from it's centennial
celebration - and the continental United States, via Satellite with the
first of man revamps that the 'Catholicism -Wow!' campaign will unveil over
the next year.

                                (applause)

Now, what does this mean for the average church-goer? Are we going to throw
out the rule book and adopt a hippie mentality in regards to our faith? No.
We're simply talking about a few minor alterations to both the aesthetic
and theoretical aspects of a religion that boasts one of the highest
membership numbers on the planet.

A few applause ring out. Glick smiles.GLICKThank you, thank you. So what are we talking about here. Well, for
example...

(pulls out crucifix)

while it has been a time-honored and traditional symboL of our faith, we
have decided to retire the highly recognizable, yet wholely depressing
symbol of our Lord, Jesus Christ, crucified. Why? Well, look at it. Would
you relish being a member of a group that uses a man nailed to two pieces
of wood as it's masthead? Of course not - who would? I've got enough
downers in my daily routine without having to deal with this visual
everytime I go to worship. lnstead, the church is going to adopt this new,
more soothing and inspiring sigil, which we feel is in-line with our new
outlook.

Glick pulls a cover off an object to his right - a two foot figure of
Christ smiling and giving the 'thumbs up'. The crowd buzzes.GLICKSee? Isn't this better? How could you not feel just great walking into a
church and seeing this behind the priest - a positive reinforcement that
whatever we do, God thinks is 'a~kay'. I love this thing, it's so...REPORTER I(interupting)

Cardinal Glick - has the church given any thought to it's position on john
Doe Jersey? Will he be given the right to die with dignity?

Another buzz rises from the crowd. Glick rolls his eyes.GLICKC'mon people. We're not here to talk about that. It's an issue we stand
firm on - euthanasia is a big no-no, just like abortion. Murder's murder.
Why won't you people accept that? Besides, we're here to talk about this

Why'd you bring us in here?AZRAELBecause you two fucks are inches away from getting yourselves caught. Going
around killing people, about to uncase your wings... don't you have any

Both sides - above and below. The orders are to terminate you on sight.BARTLEBY(shocked)

Why?AZRAELYou're pissing people off, that's why! Word on the grapevine is that God's
pissed off at your presumption, and I know Lucifer's pissed because you
assholes might just succeed where he's failed so many times, making him
look bad.BARTLEBYSo they're going to kill us?!?AZRAELThey're going to try'. That's why you have to travel incognito - tone down
your behavior, stay off their respective radars. Go about this thing more
subtly. Quit killing people - that's high profile. And for God's sake,
don't uncase your wings until you have to transubstantiate. Because the
minute you let them flap, legions of thrones and hordes of demons will
fight each other over who gets to kill you first.

A WOMAN and her small DAUGHTER walk past. While the Woman looks at the

on the shoulder. He points to Azrael's horns. The Woman pulls the Daughter
further down the aisle, oblivious to the trio.DAUGHTERMommy, that man had horns.

Azrael grabs his hat and puts it back on.AZRAELThat's the kind of shit I'm talking about!LOKIOh, lighten up.BARTLEBY(still reeling)

I can't believe they want to kill us.AZRAELBelieve it, boys. They've even got the Last Scion looking for you.LOKIYou're kidding!AZRAELThis is big. I'm telling you. Your re-entry is a thorn in a lot of sides,
and they'll stop at nothing to prevent it.LOKIIf that's the case, then why aren't you hunting for us too?AZRAELBecause I want to see you go back. You were both given a raw deal; almost
as raw as mine. If you make it back, then I figure there's hope for me.

(looks around)

In the meantime, I suggest you find an alternate mode of transportation. If
anything else comes up, I'll contact you.BARTLEBYThank you, Azrael. You're a true friend.AZRAELWould you expect anything less from a demon. I have to get back to the Pit,
before they get suspicious.

wholely unbelievable presents itself. Sometimes I wish I had just stayed
home.RUFUSYou sound like the Man.BETHANY(beat)

What was He like?RUFUSJesus? Black.BETHANYBesides that.RUFUSThe brother was centered. I mean, He was God, right? But I think He felt
left out because He was more than human, you know? We used to sit around
the fire - me and the other guys - and we'd be talking about what ass-holes
the Romans were or getting laid...BETHANYSome things never change.RUFUS...and He'd just sit there listening and smiling. We'd ask Him why He never
joined in the convo, but He said He just liked to hear us talk; about
anything. Said it was like music. I think He just wished He had unimportant
shit to talk about himself.BETHANYHow does He feel now?RUFUSHe still digs humanity, but it bothers Him to see the shit that gets
carried out in His name - wars, bigotry, but especially the factioning of
all the religions. He said humanity took a good idea and, like always,
built a belief structure on it.BETHANYHaving beliefs isn't good?RUFUSI think it's better to have ideas. You can change an idea. Changing a
belief is trickier. Life should malleable and progressive; working from
idea to idea permits that. Beliefs anchor you to certain points and limit
growth; new ideas can't generate. Life becomes stagnant. That was one thing
the Man hated - still life. He wanted everyone to be as enthralled with
living as He was. Maybe it had

something to do with knowing when He was going to die. but Christ had this
vitality that I've never encountered in another person since. You know what
I'm saving?BETHANYHe was big on life?RUFUSIt was more than that. He was the only person I ever knew who never engaged
in that most ancient of life-affirming activities.BETHANYSex.RUFUSDebate. That's the only way people know how to reaffirm that they're alive
- by debating. In all it's forms. People spend their whole lives debating:
we fight about who's right and who's wrong, we fight ourselves, we fight
each other, we fight death, we fight over beliefs, we fight over fights. We
believe that to stop debating - in any fashion -is to stop living and give
up. People say that life's a struggle, but it's not. Life is living. I'm
even guilty of it myself, the way I go on about Christ's ethnicity,
fighting for the truth to come out. And I'm dead. Even in death, the only
way I know how to live is through debate. That's sad, isn't it?BETIIANYNot if you believe it's important for people to know.RUFUSA belief's a dangerous thing, Bethany. People die for it. People kill for
it. The whole of existence is in jeopardy right now because of the Catholic
Belief structure regarding this plenary indulgence bullshit. And whether
they know it or not, Bartleby and Loki are exploiting that belief, and if
they're successful, you, me. all of this... ends in a heartbeat.

why was I so easy to cast aside? Didn't I have merit?BARTLEBYAnd you wonder if the other party's going to come to their senses and call
you back.BETIIANYThe worst is that I still think like a couple. After all these years, I
still have the 'we' mentality.BARTLEBYMine grew out of what was really a stupid misunderstanding. A
misunderstanding that grew into a total withdrawl of communication.

Empire is led by whom? Darth Vader? No. It's led by the Emperor. And the
Emperor is a practitioner of the Force, albeit the Dark Side of the Force.
And the Force is basically a religion.

(Silent Bob nods)

So the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule, and the Imperial government is
run by this old religion. What you have, then, is a theocratic government -
a government run by the church. So Luke, Han, and Leia are fighting that
government to liberate the galaxy from the pious grip of what is, in

Every Sunday.BARTLEBYDoes it do anything for you?BETHANY(thinks)

Gives me time to balance my check book every week.BARTLEBYSee? That's what I'm talking about. People don't go to church and feel
spiritual. They go to church and feel bored. But they keep going. Every
week. Out of habit.BETHANYOr in habit, if you're a nun.BARTLEBYOh... that wasn't very funny at all.BETHANYA friend of mine told me that church is like bad sex:it's messy and there's
no foreplay...

No. that's not it. I am so buzzed.BARTLEBYWhen do you think you lost your faith?BETHANYI remember the exact moment. I was on the phone with my mother, and she was
trying to counsel me through what was happening to me and my marriage. And
she said something like "There's always a plan." And I... just got so
angry. I mean, I know she was talking about God, right - God had a plan.
But I was like "What about my plans?" You know? Like, don't they count for
anything? I had planned to grow old with my husband and have a family -
wasn't that plan good enough for God?

Apparently not.

How about you? When did you lose your faith?BARTLEBYMe? Years ago. One day, God just stopped listening. I kept talking, but I
got the distinct impression that He wasn't listening anymore.BETHANYShe. And how do you know She was listening in the first place?BARTLEBY(thinks)

I guess I don't.BETHANYI hate thoughts like that. But they occur to you with age. When you're a
kid, you never question the whole faith thing - God's in Heaven, and
He's... She's always got her eye on you. I'd give anything to feel that way
again. Which is why I guess I let myself get talked into this pilgrimage. I
needed proof. And the opportunity presented itself to find out if it is
like they told us in Catholic school. And I gotta tell you - the last few

me.BARTLEBYWhere's this pilgrimage to?INT TRAIN CAR - NIGHTRufus stirs.

be liquidated?RUFUSIt doesn't have to go down like that! You haven't thought about the
consequences of re-entry!LOKIConsequences, schmonsequences.BARTLEBYI have to agree with him. No one - not you, and especially not this

it all - everything. For the first time in all these eons, I get it.LOKI(beat)

Get what?BARTLEBYIn the beginning, it was just us and Him. Angels and God. And then He
created the humans. And He gave them more than He ever gave us. Our's was
designed to be a life of servitude and worship - adoration. But He gave the
humans more - He gave them a choice. They can choose to ignore God, choose
to acknowledge Him. All this time we've been down here, everyday I felt the
absence of the Divine presence. And it pained me... as I'm sure it must
have pained you sometimes, even though you'd gloss over it with jokes. But
we feel his absence, and why? Because of the way He made us -as servants.
Had we been given free will, we could ignore the pain... like them.LOKIYou know - maybe you should take a nap or something.BARTLEBYLoki, don't you get it? It's the humans - it's always the humans. They were
given paradise; they threw it away. They were given this planet; they
destroyed it. They were favored best among all His endeavors; and some of
them don't even believe He exists. Their ego-mania corroded Hell and made
it dark and crimson.

I asked you to lay down your sword years ago - why?

Because I felt sorry for them. And where did it get us?

Thrown out.

We've paid our debt. Don't you think it's time we went home? And to do
that, I think we have to dispatch our would-be dispatchers.LOKIWait, wait, wait - kill them?! You're talking about the Last Scion, for
Christ's sake! And what about Jay and Bob - I mean, those guys were
alright.BARTLEBYDon't, my friend. Don't let your sympathies get the best of you, as they
did me way back when. Scion or not, she's just a human. And regardless, our
sins are forgiven by passing through that arch. No harm, no foul.LOKIThat sounds thin.BARTLEBYFine. We'll cover ourselves. We'll take out a slew of people. Maybe amidst
the body count, He won't notice.LOKIOh, that's being realistic.

Bartleby reaches out and grabs Loki, slamming him against the wall.BARTLEBYI'm going home, Loki. And nobody - not even the Almighty Himself - is going
to make that otherwise.

Bartleby releases Loki and smiles. He exits. Loki watches him.LOKIShit.

off.RUFUSA very basic strategy - if your enemies know where you are, then don't be
there.BETHANYAnd what's with that? Why are we enemies? The guy almost gutted me, for

going into that church.RUFUSAnd how were you going to do that? Preoccupy them with a game of Bingo?BETHANYI've never killed anything before in my life!JAYI'll do it.RUFUSShut the fuck up, little man - you couldn't kill a pint of ice cream, let
alone an angel.JAYFuck you - I can kill an angel as good as the next guy.RUFUSOh yeah? How' would you do it?JAYI'd give him a Van Damme neck-break, like in 'Hard Target'. D'jou see that
flick?RUFUS(ignoring jay; to Bethany)

Killing an angel's a two-step process - first you have to cut off their
wings. which then makes them human. From that point on, it's the same as
killing anything else - head or heart, take your pick.BETHANYYou say it as if it's easy.RUFUS(oblivious to Jay)

Problem is, I don't think we could pull it off even if we wanted to. All
this time away from the Divine Presence should have made those two weaker -

- someone with juice.BETHANYSo then we're screwed?

(shrugs)

Shit, that's the best news l've heard in days.RUFUSThis doesn't excuse you from tryng to stop them.BETHANYCount me out. You're telling me they're unstopable, I'm exhausted - both
psychologically and physically, the odds are against us. I say we kick back
and wait for the end -a little non~xistence might be just what the doctor
ordered.JAYI'm with her. I don't care about dying, so long as we're all going to die.RUFUSWhat are you babbling about now?JAYIf I was the only one, that'd bother me because every-one else would go on
living, having a good time without me. But if we all go at once, that'd be
okay, because I know I'm not missing anything.BETHANYSee? You know it's right when even he's making sense.JAYBesides, she said if we were in a situation where we were going to die in
like five minutes, she'd have sex with me and Silent Bob.RUFUSSo you're suggesting she throw in the towel and let eons of work and
history get blinked out of existence just so you can get laid?JAY(thinks)

No. Just so me and Silent Bob could get laid.BETHANYNow that we're all but in total agreement on this, I'd just like to finally
know - why me?JAYBecause you've got nice tits.BETHANYI wasn't talking to you!

Rufus looks at her. He shrugs.RUFUSFamily ties.JAYThat show's funny as hell.RUFUSShut up.

(to Bethany)

Do you know what the Apocryphal books are?

Bethany shakes her head no.RUFUSMost of that information in the Bible came from the Dead Sea Scrolls -
ancient text discovered in a cave ages ago. And when the Sanskrit was
translated, they discovered data that conflicted with the lore church
officials had already established as the basis of their religion. They
couldn't refute centuries of dogma, so they thought it best to leave
certain passages out - sometimes whole books. Those books make up the
Apocrypha.BETHANYWhat's this have to do with me?RUFUSYou've never gotten the complete picture. If they had compiled the material
together like they were supposed to, you'd get the whole story. But by
leaving text out, the church has presented you people with an extremely
sterile and unmoving account of religious history. The Creation. the entire
Old Testament, the history of Christ...

(let's her take it in)

Forget about my whole black angle for a minute...JAYWe might if you'd quit bringing it up.

Rufus backhands Jay. Silent Bob holds jay back. Rufus continues, oblivous
to Jay.RUFUSHe goes from twelve years old to thirty. Whole volumes of text about the
eighteen year struggle with His Divine nature prior to His acceptance of it

understanding of the nature of God. Why leave it out?RUFUSBecause it was all closely tied in with His family.BETHANYHis mother and father?RUFUSHis brothers and sisters.BETHANY(beat)

Wait, wait, wait - Jesus didn't have any brothers or sisters. Mary was a
virgin - that's why it's called the Immaculate Conception.RUFUSMary gave birth to Christ without having known a man's touch - that's true.
But she did have a husband. And do you really think he'd have stayed
married to her all those years if he wasn't getting laid? The nature of God
and the Virgin Birth - those are leaps of faith. But believing a wife never
humped her husband - that's just gullibility.BETHANY(sudden realization)MARY AND JOSEPH HAD SEX?!?RUFUSAll the time, from what I understand. Jesus used to tell me stories about
hearing them through the walls when He was a kid.

So you ask why you got tapped. I'll tell you why: a Christ was the
salvation of this world once before. And you're the closest thing to a
Christ that still walks.BETHANYMeaning?RUFUSThe blood that flows in your veins shares a chromosome or two at the
genetic level with the man you call Jesus.

(to Bethany)

God's a skee-ball fanatic.METATRONLet's not altogether blow some of the mystery that surrounds Him, alright?

(to Bethany)

Yes - the Lord has quite a fancy for the game; been playing it for years -
He assumes a human form once a month and indulges. Doesn't tell anyone
where He's playing; just goes away for a couple of hours. It's quite
understandable - a small exercise in hand/eye coordination has been proven
as a highly effective means of therapeutic relaxation. And from what I
understand, He always gives his free points away to neighborhood children.
Isn't that sweet?BETHANYBut She hasn't come back from one of those day-trips, is what you're
getting at?METATRON(to Rufus)

'She'? I take it she's met the Muse.

(to Bethany)

No, 'She' hasn't. And we've been unable to locate Her.RUFUSMaybe He was killed? Human form has that drawback.M ETAT RONNo - there's a different sort of foul-play afoot, children. Whomever has
set the renegade angels on their path and is keeping them quite
well-hidden. is also responsible for the Lord's whereabouts. Were He to be
killed in human form, He'd have immediately returned to Paradise. Somebody
knew enough to keep the body alive, but incapacitate Him in another fashion
- He's trapped in a body.RUFUSSo God's not dead...JAYHe's brain dead.METATRONSo it would seem. And as omnipotent as we are above, I have to admit that
we're more or less lost without His presence. We've had our people looking
everywhere for Him. And I tapped her, because I thought we might be able to
smoke out whoever's behind this. But whoever it is has been clever enough
to send some lackeys after you, as opposed to showing up themselves.RUFUSCan it be Lucifer?METATRONThankfully they seem oblivious to the situation in the nether-regions. I
know they're not responsible - at least not Lucifer. If he was, he'd have
made his move by now to conquer Heaven. And I know he's not responsible for
Bartleby and Loki because he'd have just as much to lose by their return as
everyone else.RUFUSThen what about the Golgothan and the Triplets?METATRONDon't be stupid - demons aren't exclusive to Hell. Anybody can summon one.JAY(excited)

Yeah?

Silent Bob hands Jay his newspaper and points. Jay reads.BETHANYDon't encourage them. And why did you lie to me? You said I was tapped as a
test?METATRONNo, you said that - I just didn't correct you. You were shocked enough -
how do you think you would've taken it if I told you the face of God
belonged on the back of a milk carton?RUFUSSo what do we do now?M ETAT RONI say we get drunk, kids - because I'm all out of ideas.JAY(off paper)

get them motivated. That's the whole point of the campaign. Mass attendance
is at an all-time low in this country. And it's not like we're losing them
to the Protestants or Baptists - people aren't practicing at any
denomination these days. If we can sell them some show - let 'em know the
Catholic church has some panache, we can win them back -even get some new
ones. Fill them pews, people - that's the key. And cross-promoting - like
with the cereal tie-in grabs the little ones as well. Hook 'em while
they're young.

cloven hooves and carry the pitch fork.

Jay and Silent Bob adjourn themselves from the group and approach a hat
rack, where the Cardinal's CASSOCK and MITER hang. Jay nudges Silent Bob.OC BFTHANYWe really appreciate you seeing us this late in the day, your Emminence. My
friends and I have been traveling all night in hopes of getting a chance to
talk to you about the Saint Michael's Re-Dedication ceremony.

tied around his shoulder like a cape. He strikes a Superman pose.OC BETHANYThere's going to be a world of trouble if tomorrow's ceremony goes forward

The Cardinal leans back in his chair.CLICKWhat is this - a threat? Are you planning some sort of demonstation?

Are you pro-choicers?BETHANYNo, the trouble's not from us. It's from these renegade angels who've been
stuck on earth since the plagues...

Rufus side-kicks Bethany, nonchalantly.BETHANYUh... these guys who think they're renegade angels.RUFL'SSee padre, it goes down like this - the boys believe that by passing
through the archway they can get to Heaven. Granted, it's far-fetched, but
the brothers are convinced it's the truth.

Silent Bob watches as the Miter appears slowly from behind the partition,
resembling a shark fin. It 'swims' to and fro, menacingly. Silent Bob
shakes his head.OC GLICKAnd you want me to call off the ceremony... for that?

Bethany leans forward in her seat.BETHANYWell. they're very passionate about it. Dangerously so. They could turn
violent if they walk through that arch and nothing happens.RUFUSThese guys could blow, and if they do, they're going to take some people
with them. Call this thing off.CLICK(beat)

Council of Churches. Heck, let's not stop there, maybe even God Himself.BETHANYYou can't say Himself; it could be a woman.GLICK(rubs temples)

Your passion for all topics insignificant, including the gender of our
almighty lord, tests my patience, people. Now I'm a very important man with
very important matters that demand my attention, so if you'll please...RUFUSI'm telling you man. this ceremony is a mistake.GLICKThe Catholic Church does not make mistakes.RUFUSWhat about the church's silent consent to the slave trade?BETHANYAnd it's platform of non-involvement during the Holocaust?CLICK(beat)

incarnation of Holy Mother Church responsible for oversights of old. Now

pranksters who've targeted me as the focus of their evening's merriment!

Now, let me just give you a bit of history on this particular little
hundred years young House of God...OC BARTLEBYThis is no longer God's House. God doesn't live here anymore.

The crowd turns, aghast. Bartleby pushes his way through them, sheepishly
followed by Loki.BARTLEBYHe's grown weary of your superficial faith and has turned a deaf ear to
your lip-service prayers. He is no longer amused, and has abandonned you -
His favorites - to the whim of judgement. Hypocrites and charlatans -
prepare to taste God's wrath!LOKI(whispering)

one brisk motion. Loki's eyes bug out. The crowd takes flight.BARTLEBY(releasing dead Cop)

your tresspasses... in blood.

Tell them how I was slighted by the Almighty.SERENDIPITYYou got what you deserved, you yellow shithead.AZRAELEver the apple polisher. I'd hoped that when you left Paradise, you did it
finally because you couldn't tolerate the injustice that was visited upon
your own brother.BETHANYHe's your brother?!SERENDIPITYNot technically. We were created at the same time.AZRAELTo compliment one another. Two spirits of pure inspiration.BARTLEBYSo what happened?AZRAELYes. What. Lucifer got restless and started his little war for the throne.
Heaven became divided into two factions - the faithful and the renegades.
The ethereal planes were chaotic with battle, angel against angel. And when
it was all over, Cod cast the rebels into perdition.SERENDIPITYBut Azrael refused to fight. He wouldn't ally himself to God or Lucifer. He
remained in the middle, waiting to see who came out victorious.JAYWhat are you - some kind of fucking chicken?!AZRAELI was an artist! I was inspiration! A muse has no place in battle! Our job
is to create - not destroy!SERENDIPITYSo after the fallen were banished to Hell, God turned on those that
wouldn't fight, and my brother here was sent down with the demons.
Something he considers a grave injustice.AZRAELDon't tell me that you never questioned the judgement, Serendipity; that
you don't think the Almighty acted too rashly?SERENDIPITYYou've been waiting for millions of years to ask me that, haven't you? It's
been on your mind since the moment you fell. It's been gnawing at you this
long.AZRAELWell?SERENDIPITYNo, Azrael. It never bothered me, and I'll tell you why:

you stood behind your office, you prick. So you were an artist - big deal.
Elvis was an artist, but that didn't stop him from joining the service in
time of war. That's why he's the King... and you're a schmuck.BETHANYSo all this is about revenge?! You're going to unmake existence because you
have a grudge against God?!AZRAELAfter the first million years, revenge was the farthest thing from my mind.
Self-preservation became the only necessity.RUFUSMeaning?AZRAELEscape. Escape from Hell became my all-consuming reason. So I studied the
religions and waited for my opportunity to present itself; which flnallv
did. in the form of the plenary indulgence And while I couldn't exercise it
myself. I knew the perfect vessels through which I could free myself from
torment.RUFUSBartleby and Loki.AZRAELAfter that, it was a simple matter or waiting for a church to celebrate
their Centennial, and when that finally happened, applying some of the old
inspiration tactics - bv sending the pair an article laced with ideas. An
incantation I picked up in the Pit kept them cloaked and off Heaven's
radars, and aside from the Triplets and the Gologothan, no soul in Hell had
a clue as to what was going on.

(smiles)

Won't proud Lucifer weep when he realizes I triumphed over the Power in a
way he never dared or dreamed.

(shakes it off)

But no plan, no matter how intricate, could succeed if the Almighty was in
the realm of the quick. So I dispatched Him in a fairly ingenious fashion.BETHANYHow so?AZRAELOh no. I've seen way to many Bond movies to know that you never reveal all
the details of your plan - no matter how close you may think you are to
success. Suffice it to say, the Catholics have been even more helpful in
insuring my success than by just supplying the clean-slate archwav.

(gets up)

The only X-Factor was the involvement of the Last Scion. I'm amazed that
someone up there would have the balls to make a move without the Lord's
say-so. Believe me - I sweated when you stumbled upon my boys on that
train. But alas, here you are - powerless to stop the inevitable.BETHANYLook, asshole - I don't know if anyone explained the rules to you, but if
you succeed, everything gets blinked out of existence - even you.AZRAEL(beat)

Human, have you ever been to Hell? I think not. Do you know that once Hell
was nothing more than the absence of Cod? And if you'd ever been in His
presence. then you'd realize that's punishment enough. But then your kind
came along - and made it so much worse.BETHANYHumans aren't capable of one hundredth the evil a shitbag demon like
yourself is.AZRAELEvil is an abstract; it's a human construct. But true to his irresponsible
nature. man won t own up to being the engineer of evil, so he blames his
dark deeds on my ilk. But his selfishness is limitless, and it's not enough
for him to shadow his own existence. He turned Hell into a suffering Pitt -
fire, wailing, darkness - the kind of place anyone would do anything to get
out of. And why? Because he lacks the ability to forgive himself. It is
beyond your abilities to simply make recompense for and regret the sins you
commit. No - you choose rather to create a psychodrama and dwell in a
foundless belief that God could never forgive your 'grievous offenses'. So
you bring your guilt and inner-decay with you to Hell - where the horrid
imaginations of so many gluttons-for-punishment give birth to the sickness
that has infected the abyss since the first one of your kind arrived there,
begging to be 'punished'. And in doing so, they've transformed the cold and
solitude to pain and misery. I've spent eons privy to the flames, inhaling
the decay, hearing the wail of the damned. I know what effect such horrors
have on the delicate psyche of an angelic beihg.

Would you like to glimpse pain eternal? Look...

Azrael places his hand over Bethany's eyes. For about ten seconds, we see
some of the most fucked up and disturbing imagery that can be crammed into
240 frames of film.

Azrael pulls his hand away. Bethany is fried, convulsing uncontrolably.AZRAELI'd rather not exist than go back to that. And if everyone has to go down
with me, so be it.SERENDIPITY(holding up Bethany)

You're still thinking only about yourself, you fuckmg child.AZRAELNow, now, now. Things are getting too tense in here. What say we watch a

A Stygian Triplet smacks him with it's hockey stick.JAYHey!AZRAELI was thinking more along the lines of current events.

On the T.V. - a sweaty and panicked REPORTER barks into the camera,
obscuring the chaos behind him. Screams are heard.REPORTER...I repeat - men with huge fucking wings have laid waste to St.
Michael's... Bullets don't seem to affect them... police who were on the
scene are dead... The remaining crowd has dropped to their knees,

a couple of minutes, it won't matter anymore.

While he speaks, Serendipity looks to Silent Bob. Silent Bob snaps to
attention, and locks eyes with Serendipity. He looks to the golf club, then
back at her. He nods.

Azrael suddenly catches the exchange between the two.AZRAELNow what was that all about?SERENDIPITYHunhh? Oh. nothing. I had something in my eye.AZRAEL(getting up)

Bullshit. What are you trying to do, Serendipity -get the guy killed? Now
who's the fucking child? What did you tell him - to hit me with the golf
club? Are you serious?

Take a shot - take your best shot. C'mon - c'mon, bright boy.

The Stygian Triplets snicker. Silent Bob stares at Azrael, perplexed.AZRAELDon't you know anything?

Silent Bob looks to Serendipity. She nods. He shrugs and swings the club
with all his might into Azrael's chest - which caves in, blowing muck and
shit everywhere.

Rufus, Jay, and Serendipity turn on their captors, grabbing the Stygian
Triplets by the throats.SERENDIPITYBETHANY! BLESS THE SINK!BETHANYWHAT?!?SERENDIPITYDO IT!Bethany leaps over the bar, pushing over the dead bartender, and blesses
the melting-ice filled sink. Serendipity urges Rufus and Jay to follow her,
with the Triplets in hand. They submerge them - head first - in the sink.
Cruddy steam and muck blows out of the water. The Triplets convulse and
fall still.

Azrael clutches at his sucking chest wound, dropping to his knees. He grabs
Silent Bob's leg. Silent Bob kicks him onto his back and out cold.JAY(joining Silent Bob)

What the fuck have you been eating?

Silent Bob shrugs.BETHANYWhat just happened?SERENDIPITY(collecting hockey sticks)

And Glick's the kind of asshole that would bless his own clubs for a better
game. And the sink...?SERENDIPITYYou've got that Divine heritage going for you - sanctifing is just one of
the fringe benefits.BETHANYRemind me to try the water-to-wine thing at my next party.

(to Jay)

How far away is this church?JAYThree towns over - about five miles.BETHANYWe've gotta make tracks, people - there isn't much time left. Rufus, grab
his gun.RUFUSTen steps ahead of you.BETHANY(going through dead bartender's pockets)

We can take the bartender's car - I don't think he'll be needing it
anymore.

Bethany and Serendipity rush out.JAYWe gonna make it?RUFUSWas Jesus down?

Rufus and Jay exit. Silent Bob stares down at Azrael's body. Jay comes back
and yanks him out the door.EXT STREET - DAYCardinal Click runs to a pay phone. Sweating and bloody, he looks a mess.
He presses '0' and looks around wildly - particularly skyward.GLICK(to God)

Look, if you didn't like the cereal thing, we could've gone in a different
direction!

(to phone)OPERATOR! SEND MORE POLICE TO SAINT MICHAEL'S PARISH - NOW!! PEOPLE AREGETTING KILLED BY...!As he speaks, a large shadow falls over him from above. It grows larger,
enveloping Click. He drops the receiver, drops to his knees, and screams.EXT SAINT MICHAEL'S - DAYBethany, Jay, Serendipity, Silent Bob, and Rufus stare OC, horrified.JAYHoly shit.

Bodies, bodies everywhere - partial, whole, bloody - hanging, burning,
upended. No one is left standing. It's a scene straight out of Hell.
Bethany buries her face in Rufus' chest.JAYSee? And people wonder why I don't go to church.BETHANYAre we too late?SERENDIPITYTo save these poor schmucks, yes. But we still exist.BETHANYWhere are they?RUFUSThey could already be in the church.SERENDIPITYWhich means that if they come out, nobody touches them.JAYAre you shitting me? The brother here is going to shred them with his
Schwarzenneger special - ain't you, homey?SERENDIPITYIf they've passed through that arch, they come out clean. And if they die,
they go straight up - and we know what happens then.JAYWhat if they just kill themselves?BETHANYThey can't - it's a mortal sin. You die with a mortal sin on your soul and
you burn. They'd go to hell, and that's not what they're after.JAYSo then what the fuck are we supposed to do?! Just wait for a solution to
fall out of the sky?!

On cue, a body plummets out of the sky and hits the ground before the
group, quite like Rufus had, way back at the start. This body, however,
bursts apart like a body would if dropped from a large height. Jay looks at
Rufus.JAYFriend of your's?RUFUS'fraid not.OC VOICEIt was a Cardinal.

They all turn to see Loki, leaning against a body or two, drinking from a
bottle of champagne. His wings lie beside him, filthy - blood spattered and
ashen. He looks exhausted. Rufus trains the gun on him.LOKIKind of hard to tell with his face like that, but the Rosaries are a dead
giveaway.JAY(goes for the Uzi)IT'S ONE OF THEM!! KILL IT!!!BETHANY(struggling to stop him)NO...!She slaps the Uzi out of Jay's grip. It clatters to the side.BETHANY(to Jay)

Don't you listen?! We can't touch them!JAYI wasn't gonna touch him, I was gonna shoot him!LOKI(looking skyward)

He's been at it for awhile now.

In the distance above - a mere shadow against the sky - something winged
soars and stops, releasing what looks like a very panicky human being.OC LOKIWe ran out of parishoners, so he just started picking up anyone off the
street. You're looking at eons of repression getting purged. If only we'd
been able to jerk off.

Loki drags himself a few feet backwards.LOKII'd step back if I were you.

They jump back just as the body hits the ground and explodes. Bethany
charges at Loki, grabs his lapels, and shakes him furiously.BETHANYWHY?!? WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU HOPE TO PROVE?!? ALL THESE PEOPLE - WHY?!?JAY(to Rufus)

I thought we weren't supposed to touch them?RUFUSI think our Bethan's about hit her ceiling.

Loki slaps Bethany away, non-chalantly.LOKIThis wasn't my idea. alright? I just wanted to go home.

(takes a big champagne swig)

We both wanted to go home. But he snapped. When he realized who you were
and what you'd have to do, he just lost it.

(smiles)

You know what's funny about it? He never could stand to see me work. He
said he always felt son~' for you people - that you didn't know any better.

(looks up)

Now look at him.JAYThis guy's drunker than hell.SERENDIPITYWhich means he's human now - his wings have been cut off.

(slapping Loki to sober him up)

Loki! Loki!LOKI(recognizing her)

The Muse. Haven't seen you in a long time. What's with the tits?SERENDIPITYLoki - have you walked through the arch yet? C'mon. tell me! Have you gone
in and come out through the archway yet?!VOICENo.

Bartleby lands beside them, draping his wings at his sides, brushing
himself off.BARTLEBYWe were awaiting your arrival.SERENDIPITYBartleby - listen to me! You can't go through with this! Azrael was just
using you! If you go back this way...

Bartleby slaps her down.BARTLEBYI've become aware of the reprocussions, Muse. I know what I'm doing.

Bethany leaps at him, all fists and fury.BETHANYYOU FUCK! YOU SICK, TWISTED FUCK!! LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE!! LOOK AT All
you've

done...!

Bartleby subdues her. He strokes her hair.BARTLEBYBethany - you of all people should understand what I'm t~'ing to accomplish
here. You too have been abandonned. You know what it's like to be cast
aside. But while you've only felt the devastating effects for a few years,
I've dealt with it for millenia. And while you never see your ex-husband or
how blissful he is with his new wife...

(picks up her face and smiles at her)

And he is...

(drops her head)

..seeing you people everywhere. everyday, trapped on this perfect little
world He created for you... it's a constant reminder that though my kind
came first, your kind was most revered. And your kind knows forgiveness,
while my kind knows regret. A lesson must be taught. All are accountable...
even God.

(steps back)

Soon a cadre of police will arrive, just in time to kill us as we exit the
church. And then this failed experiment called existence will cease to be.

Loki stumbles to his feet.LOKII can't... let you do this, Bartleby...

(he sways as if drunk)

I didn't know we... would end existence...BARTLEBY(to Bethany)

My compatriot. Genocide takes a lot out of him. He's weakened. And more
importantly. he's now a human being. A condition that carries two
liabilities: a conscience...

Bartleby pulls a knife and guts Loki. He stares at Bartleby as he dies,
confused and betrayed. Serendipity nods to Rufus and Silent Bob.BARTLEBY..and a short life span.

(in a whisper; to Loki)

Sorry, old friend - but you lost the faith.

Rufus and Serendipity and Silent Bob jump Bartleby and start throwing
punches. Silent Bob bites his wing. Jay grabs Bethany and pulls her behind
a bush.BETHANY(peering out from behind)

He's lost it! We're fucked! We're absolutely fucked!JAY(pulling off clothes)

I hear you.BETHANYI can't believe this shit! We're on the brink of nonexistence and God's
still nowhere to be found! What the fuck kind of deity gets kidnapped?!JAY(pulling open pants)

Amen to that.BETHANY(suddenly notices him)

What the hell are you doing?!JAYI'd say we've got about five minutes left to live; the whole world's going
to end. You said you'd fuck me.BETHANYAre you a complete lunatic?! Everyone's out there battling that thing and
you want to cower back here and jump my bones?! We have to go down
fighting!JAYNo - no time for that foreplay stuff, just sex.BETHANYYou pig...!JAYWhat?! It's all over; nobody's gonna beat that thing! Now we can either lay
here all comatose like that

John Doe Jersey bastard behind us, or we can make with the love.

Bethany freezes.BETHANY(finally!)

What did you say?!JAY'Make with the love'? I just said that to be sensitive. Usually I call it
boning.BETHANYNo - about John Doe Jersey?JAYThat guy - the one that they won't take off life support - John Doe Jersey.
This is where he's at.BETHANYWhat? Where?JAYSaint Michael's hospital - over there.

(points behind them)

There, across the street, sits a HOSPITAL.BETHANY(thinks)

Where's the nearest boardwalk?JAYLook, I ain't got time to win you a prize or something, we gotta get to it
before...BETHANYWHERE IS IT?!?JAY(scared)

Asbury Park. About five miles away.BETHANYYou ever been there?!JAY(really scared)

Once. I was banging this girl who worked at the carousel. She wanted to do
it on the ride, but I got sick and started puking...BETHANY(grabs his face)DO THEY HAVE SKEE-BALL THERE?!?JAY(piss-scared; high pitched)

...yes.

Bethany kisses Jay hard on the lips, jumps up and looks over the bush.JAY(warming up)

Now that's more like it.

Rufus and Serendipity battle Bartleby, his wings thrashing about. Silent
Bob is getting back on his feet.BETHANYBOB!Silent Bob looks to Bethany. She waves him over and bends back down to Jay
who half-closes his eyes, and puckers his lips. Bethany pinches his lips
together and raises jay to his feet, ust as Silent Bob arri\'es.BETHANY(to Jay)

Whatever you do - stall Bartleby from going into that church!

(to Silent Bob)

Bob - come with me!

(they exit)
