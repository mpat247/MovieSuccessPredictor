                            Adam HerzWHITE REVISION: 7/7/98NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERSAND SOME "SCENE OMITTED" SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FORTHIS SOFT COPY.INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - NIGHTPAN across details in a bedroom...we see discarded
     shirts...pants...socks...and hearPORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good.JIM (O.S.)Yeah, I'm the best, baby.

     Now we see a TV...but the picture isn't clear.  Or, more
     appropriately, the picture is scrambled -- it phases in
     and out.  Bars scroll across it.  And we get occasional
     glimpses of what looks like --JIM (O.S.)(CONT'D)...oh -- that was a tit, tits...

     As most high-school guys know (but few will admit), it is
     possible to watch the pay channels while they're
     scrambled.  You just need a decent imagination to fill in
     the rest of the picture.  We PULL BACK to see JIM -- 17,
     short, horny.PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)Give it to me!  Yes!JIMOh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.

     Jim is, uh, physically involved with the scrambled babe.
     We TILT DOWN to see a small multimedia presentation next
     to Jim on his bed.  "Cosmopolitan" is open to a sexy
     model...a yearbook is open to the "girl's swim team"
     section...and a dictionary next to Jim, open to the
     "Vagina" listing, accompanied by a big vagina diagram.PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)Don't you love my sexy body?!JIMI do, baby, I do.

     He frantically looks around...and grabs a tube sock off
     the floor.PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)You're so big!JIMYeah, that's right.PORNO-CHANNEL STUD (V.O.)(deep macho voice)
               Ohhh, tell me you're a nasty girl!

     Jim is thrown off.PORNO-CHANNEL STUD (V.O.)(CONT'D)Yeahhh, you been bad, real bad!JIMMan, shut up!

     Suddenly there's a KNOCK at the door, immediately after
     which JIM'S MOM enters.  Jim scrambles and quickly covers
     himself and the dictionary with a pillow.  She's
     oblivious to his doings.JIM'S MOMHey, Jimmy.  I just wanted to say
               sweet dreams.JIMYep, okay Mom, 'night.JIM'S MOM(leans in to Jim)
               Kiss goodnight.

     Jim is revolted.  Very reluctantly he gives her a kiss.
     She turns to leave, and notices the TV.JIM'S MOM (CONT'D)Is something wrong with the reception?JIMYeah.  Damn cable.  There's this
               nature show that I'm trying to watch.PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)Fuck me!  Yes!JIMUh...

     He hurriedly tries to change the channel with the REMOTE,
     but instead the VOLUME GOES UP.PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)BLOW YOUR WAD ON MY TITS!!Jim panics as his mom reacts, shocked.JIM(choking)
               Must...be...broken...

     JIM'S DAD enters.JIM'S DADWhat the heck is this?JIMNothing!JIM'S MOMI think he's trying to watch one of
               the illegal channels.JIMJesus, Mom!  They're notillegal!
               They'repaychannels.  How could a
               television channel be illegal?!  God,
               get a clue!JIM'S DADJames, don't speak that way to your
               mother!PORNO-CHANNEL STUD (V.O.)Play with my hairy balls!JIM'S DADTurn that garbage off!  Give me that!

     Jim's Dad grabs for the remote, which is sitting on the
     pillow that's been covering Jim.  The pillow gets brushed
     aside -- revealing the Big Vagina Diagram, Jim with his
     shorts down, and a very strategically placed tube sock.JIM'S MOMOh my God!JIM'S DADHoney, why don't you let me handle this
               one.

     He ushers her out.  Jim's Dad is stuck there with his
     half-naked son.  Horrible, awful embarrassment.  A long,
     strained beat.JIM'S DAD (CONT'D)Jesus Christ.  The dictionary?  Hell,
               son, I'll buy you some dirty
               magazines.

     Jim's Dad exits, shaking his head.  Jim sits agape,
     humiliated.PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)Oooh, spank me, daddy, spank me!EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS - DAYWe see a Honda Accord drive by a sign at the city limits:
     "Welcome to East Great Falls, Michigan -- A Great Place
     To Be"EXT. FRONT OF SCHOOL - DAYThe front of the school.  KEVIN drives up in his Accord.
     He's a good-humored, good-enough-looking high school
     senior.  VICKY rides shotgun -- pretty, smart, confident.
     She's holding a large, thick envelope, with a big
     "Vanderbilt" return address on it.KEVINIt's a big, thick envelope, Vicky.
               You got in.VICKYYou think so?

     She tears it open.  Pulls out a course catalog, various
     forms, and a letter which she hands to Kevin.KEVIN"Dear Ms. Hughes.  We're sorry, but
               after keeping you on the wait list for

     Vicky SCREAMS in excitement, like a girl at a Beatles
     concert.  Then she LAUGHS, and gives Kevin a big kiss and
     hug.VICKYI love you!

     She hugs Kevin tighter -- as he looks a little frazzled,
     almost perfunctorily returning the hug.EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD - MORNINGJim has met up with CHRIS OSTREICHER -- "OZ" -- a cocky

     bounces the lacrosse ball off a locker, catching it
     again.  Kevin speaks a little distantly, unnerved.KEVINThen she said -- she loves me.OZOh shit dude, the L-word!JIMAnd you said...KEVINNothing, I just hugged her back.JIMYou think she was serious?KEVINI couldn't tell -- She could've meant
               like, "I love you grandma" or "I love

               regularly?  We should play them
               backwards!  That'll be so funny!

     The Band Dorks LAUGH and agree, "hilariously" attempting
     to play their instruments from the wrong end.  The guys

     Someone is HOLLERING down the hall.  Running towards Oz
     is STEVE STIFLER -- very clean-cut and preppy, he's a
     maniac, a jackass, much worse than Oz.  Not really part

     Oz gives a little nod, avoiding the issue.STIFLERHey, man, I'm not making fun.  I'm
               fuckin' impressed.  I mean, "Footlong
               or six-inch, white or wheat," that's

               damn imitation hot dog.FINCH("for the hundredth time")
               This is no imitation.  Removing the

               adding their own techniques.  Things
               they figured out themselves.

     Kevin slides out the section of bibles from the bottom
     shelf.  Pulls out a pocket knife.  Flips up the bottom of
     the shelf.  Slides it out.

     There, a bit dusty, is an old book.  Many extra pages of
     notebook paper have been tucked into it, nearly breaking
     the binding.  The original title is now obscured -- over
     it, someone has written "The Bible."

     Remember when Indian Jones found that gold statue?  It's
     like that right now.

     Kevin carefully pulls it out.  Reverently flips through
     it.  Full of details.  Explicit diagrams.  Anecdotes.
     And atop each handwritten page is a year, indicating the
     date it was added.

     fresh-baked pie on the counter.  Next to it is a note:
     "Jimmy - Apple, your favorite.  I'll be home late.
     Enjoy!  Love Mom."

     Jim sniffs the pie, taking in the aroma.  Then stops...as
     a quizzical look spreads across his face.

     After a moment of thought, he slides a finger into the
     pie.  Moves it around a bit, studying the consistency.

     Then Jim becomes more curious.  We can see the gears in
     his head start to turn.  He looks down at the pie like

     the song ends, Oz continues just a moment more with his
     shtick -- a little, heartfelt vocal "scat" to tag the
     number.  The thing is, it actually sounds really good.
