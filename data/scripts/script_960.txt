                  By some estimates, 2% of the Japanese

                  the war: factory workers, soldiers,
                  pilots.  Maybe that's why it took two
                  bombs to get 'em to surrender.  A
                  nuclear blast is just a minor

Danny uses the diversion.  He quickly TAKES SOMETHING from him own 
jacket pocket and SLIPS IT IN THE HOLE IN LITTLE BILL'S JACKET between 
the coat and the lining.

Danny raises his gun.TANNERWhatever you say, man.  Look ... can

                  You're in the bathroom.  You've been
                  shot in the shoulder ...

Danny shoots Tanner in the shoulder.  He collapses to the floor.

ON GARCETTI - his eyes flutter and open.

Danny walks over to Tanner and stands above him.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  ... there's two guys with masks and
                  guns in the other room about to kill
                  your wife.

Tanner looks at Danny, confused.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  But you know if you go out there,
                  they'll kill you, too.  You'll both
                  die.  What do you do?

Tanner realizes what Danny is talking about.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Do you go out there and die like a
                  man or do you live to fight another day?

Tanner doesn't answer.

                             Danny (cont'd)
                  What do you do?

Still no answer.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Answer the question!

Tanner is ghost white, loosing blood quickly.

                  What do you do!TANNERPlease ... don't do this ...DANNYAnswer the fucking question!

When Danny goes to shoot Tanner again ...

... Tanner pulls a K-BAR KNIFE from the back of his belt and plunges it 
into the back of Danny's gun hand.  The gun discharges, missing Tanner.

Danny drops the gun.  Tanner snatches it up.

Tanner immediately has the gun inches from Danny's head.  Danny freezes...TANNERDoes that answer your question?
                       (beat)
                  I fight.

Danny trying to remember.

                  Pretty big fucking difference if you ask me.

DANNY starts chuckling. Looks up at Tanner.DANNYIt doesn't matter.

Danny looks down at the syringe again.  Tanner sees it too.TANNERToo late to be a hero.

Danny picks up the syringe.

Tanner pulls the trigger.

INSIDE THE GUN - MOVING SLOWLY towards the firing pin as it springs 
forward toward CAMERA with a LOUD CLICK.THE GUN IS EMPTY.DANNYTen it is.

Danny jams the SYRINGE INTO TANNER'S THROAT all the way down to the 
plunger, dosing him with the meth.

Tanner goes down, blood bubbling from his throat around the syringe.  
His eyes roll back as he  convulses from the drugs.

Danny struggles to his feet.

Tanner quivers from head to toe like some freaked-out Pentecostal in 
the throws of a holy possession.

Danny pulls the syringe from Tanner's throat.  A LONG WET WEEZEESCAPES.Suddenly, A NOISE BEHIND DANNY.

Garcetti standing there pointing his gun at Danny, rocking slightly 
back and forth, a bullet hole in his cheekbone.  He looks brain dead.

Danny doesn't move. TANNER STILL WHEEZING.

Garcetti looks like he wants to shoot his gun, but can't.  He keeps 
looking down at his hand, trying to get it to obey.

Danny calmly walks over and takes the gun from Garcetti.

Garcetti puts his hand to his nose and blows out a clot of blood.  He 
looks down at his hand.

He has hacked up the bullet he was shot with.

Garcetti smiles an embarrassed smile at Danny.  TANNER'S WHEEZINGCONTINUES.DANNY(softly)
                  You're dead.

Garcetti nods slightly.  He goes to a kneeling position, then curls up 
on the floor like he is taking a nap and dies.

Danny goes over to the couch and sits down.

Danny with his head in his hands, emotionally and physically exhausted.TANNER WHEEZING LOUDER AND LOUDER.CLOSE ON DANNY'S FACE.  Blank.  Devoid of anything.  He stuffs 
Garcetti's gun into his own mouth, hand shaking.

He takes the gun out.

Stuffs it back in again, shoving it way down, almost gagging on it.  
The barrel clatters against his teeth. He takes it out again.  THEWHEEZING CONTINUES.Danny starts crying.  Lifts the gun halfway again, then drops it.

He jumps up.  Goes over to the still-wheezing Tanner and empties his 
clip into him.  When the clip is spent, Danny keeps pulling the trigger 
... over and over again.

He stands there pulling the trigger again and again and again and 
again.FADE OUT.FADE IN:INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHTDanny dressed in his "Tom" clothes. He limps over to the bed and picks 
up the trumpet case.  Carries it over to the mirror.

Danny staring at his reflection. He lights a cigarette.DANNYMy name is Tom Van Allen. I'm a
                  trumpet player.

Danny smiles.VOICE (O.S.)Nah, you're Danny Flynne.

He turns.

COLETTE and QUINCEY standing there.  Quincey holds a nine millimeter 
with a muzzle suppressor.QUINCEYYou're a motherfucking rat.

He shoots Danny in the stomach.  Danny slumps to the floor.  His 
cigarette falls out of his mouth and rolls under the bed.

Colette freaks.COLETTEYou said you wouldn't kill him!

She tries to go to Danny but Quincey stops her.COLETTEYou lied to me!QUINCEYOops.  My bad.

Danny looks at them, confused, a blood stain blossoming on his white 
shirt.DANNYColette, what happened?  Didn't the cops ...QUINCEYThe cops came.  But they didn't find
                  nothing.  Turns out their C.I. game
                  'em some bad information.

Quincey holds up the baggie of drugs.

Danny looks from Quincey to Colette.  Colette looks away.

                  So I brought in a rat of my own.

Danny looks at Colette, dumbfounded.DANNYYou set me up?QUINCEYBitch played you like a squeezebox, Romeo.

Danny can't help from laughing at the irony.  Beads of sweat are 
forming on his blanched face.  He looks at Colette with a wry smile.DANNYYou're good, princess. I'll give you that.COLETTEDanny, it's not what you think.

Danny looks down at his bloody stomach.COLETTEI owed them money ... a lot of
                  money ... they didn't give me a
                  choice.  You know how it works.  When

Danny stares at her, not sure what to believe.  He looks over at 
Quincey.DANNYShe selling me a bill, home boy?

Quincey shakes his head.QUINCEYNah, she ain't lying.  She took a
                  pretty good beating from you, ace. I
                  seen grown men crack after a lot

Danny looks at Colette, imagining the awful beating she must have 
taken.DANNYIt's okay. It's okay.

The drapes go up in flames.  Quincey puts the gun to the back of her 
head.QUINCEYYou wanna die here with him or come with me?DANNYColette, go.COLETTEI don't want to leave you.DANNYYour daughter needs you.  Go.

The fire continues to spread.  Colette kisses Danny on the lips.  
Quincey pulls her away.

Collette looks back one last time just as the flames reach the door, 
cutting off any escape.

Danny breathing hard. He gets up.  Staggers over to the mirror where 
his trumpet is.

He opens the case and takes the trumpet out.

He plops down on the bed and BLOWS A FEW NOTES. He stops for a second, 
a smile on his lips.
