     starts to move away.

     for help, but it's already passed.RONNAIt's not what it looks like. I mean, it

     At the last moment, Ronna bolts. She ducks around the corner
     of a van, only to see...A RED MIATAdoing 20 in reverse. It brakes, but there's no time. It hits
     her hard.

     She flies up over the roof of the car, CRASHING down on the

     sickening THUD.GAINESstands where he is, gun still in hand, dumbfounded.

     He looks to the Miata. It suddenly takes off, kicking up dirt
     and grass. For a moment, all is quiet.

     around, then he starts working his way back across the parking
     lot. Disappears.40."GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)55   EXT. IN THE DITCH - NIGHT (RAIN)                                         55We stay on Ronna's body as we HEAR the Miata suddenly pull
     away. Somewhere in the distance, the Mary Xmas Supafest is
     still RAGING, but here it's only a WHISPER with a beat.

     With a sudden SPASM, Ronna moves. Turns herself over on her
     back. Each breath WHEEZES and GURGLES.

     She pulls the remainder of the holly crown out of her hair and
     tosses it aside. She tries to push herself up. Her legs won't
     move.

     Catching her breath, she looks to the top of the ditch, waiting
     for somebody to look in. No one does. Adjusting herself, she
     slides against a weathered magazine. Spin. Jane's Addiction
     on the cover.

     She collapses back, a new wave of pain.

     After a beat, she suddenly LAUGHS, until gradually it becomes a
     COUGHING. She pushes her hair back, streaking blood across her

     Then the car's ALARM starts going off.     Marcus SCREAMS with
     frustration. He punches buttons on the     keychain, but nothing
     will quiet it. He tries the key in the     ignition. It won't
     turn over. Climbing out of the car, he     kicks it with all his

                So last night I went back to the pier
                to do some investigating of my own.
                Turns out there are two boats named the
                Princess. Only, one just got back from
                two weeks at sea -- Sal Dominico's
                boat. It got me thinkin' -- if Chase

                how come he didn't tell Lucas, or
                Gamble, or Myerson? Why would he drive
