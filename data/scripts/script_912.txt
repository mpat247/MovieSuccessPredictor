                   weren't too many surprises left. My
                   first was Winston Churchill. He sat in
                   your chair, in frock coat and top hat,
                   and was kind enough to give a shyTyoung girl like me quite an education.TONYI can imagine.ELIZABETHith time, one has hopefully added

                   execute our constitutional

                   to be their leader. And so the duty

                   you to become Prime Minister, and form
                   a government in my name.TONY stares. Lost for words. Then..ELIZABETHGenerally, this is where you say
                   `yes.'TONY`Yes'.The QUEEN extends her hand, which TONY kisses. She withdraws
          it again - quite sharply, then DISCREETLY PRESSES A BUZZER by
          her chair indicating the ceremony is over. The EQUERRY opens
          a door, and CHERIE is invited inside.ELIZABETH (cont'd)
                   How nice to see you again, Mrs Blair.HERIE curtseys awkwardly, reluctantly, shallowly..ELIZABETH (cont'd)

                   leave it there.With that the QUEEN shakes TONY's hand. TONY and CHERIE
          awkwardly back out of the royal presence, leaving The QUEEN
          and JANVRIN.ELIZABETHNot too short, was it? I gave him

                   struggling to lead the world in
                   mourning for a woman who threw
                   everything she offered back in her
                   face, and who seemed, in the last few
                   years, to be committed twenty-four
                   seven to destroy everything she holds
                   dear.
