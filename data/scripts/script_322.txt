               David EbershoffEXT. KATTEGAT SEA, JUTLAND, DENMARK, 1920'S, DAYFADE IN:A rectangle of ferociously stormy sea viewed from battered
cliffs. Silver waves are whipped by a wind that flies at us,
stinging, relentless. Somewhere, unseen in the barren
landscape, something is at its mercy - we hear the RUSTLE and
PUNCH of the weather going at it...DISSOLVE TO:INT. WOMAN'S EYEThe same scene reflected across the surface of a woman's
brown eye, intense with emotion, curiosity. Gradually, the
WEATHER SOUNDS are overtaken by VOICES coming up. At first
the SOCIAL CHATTER is PERIPHERAL, then the VOICES grow more
STRIDENT, OPPRESSIVE. The eye blinks.INT. GALLERY, COPENHAGEN, DENMARK, EVENINGA painting of the same sea, captured with remarkable accuracy
of feeling. A HUBBUB OF GABBLING VOICES. Too many people in
a low-ceilinged room. One voice dominates now -OLDER WOMAN (O.S.)Don't you wish you could paint like
           that?

We pull out to see GERDA WEGENER'S brown eyes shift from deep      *
scrutiny of the painting to polite social focus as she takes
in an excited OLDER WOMAN.GERDAI'm sorry...?OLDER WOMANI said, don't you wish you could
           paint like your husband? Really - you must
           be so proud...

The woman smiles and heads into the crowd, leaving Gerda to
consider... Gerda's gaze travels across the well-dressed
gathering. Far off in a corner, there's an inner circle
where her handsome husband EINAR WEGENER is being showered
with praise. A portly goateed man dominates the scene -
RASMUSSEN, Einar's dealer.RASMUSSENThey're all Veijle, where he grew
           up.(CONTINUED)26/11/152.CONTINUED:Gerda begins walking toward them through the throng...

             And I don't say my client is
             the best landscape artist in
             Denmark... but, he is in the top
             one!

Einar cringes as the crowd laughs, delighted. An exotic-
looking woman with mischief playing on her full lips
approaches Gerda. This is ULLA FONSMARCK. They're friends.ULLA(a stage whisper)
             It's going very well.GERDAOh yes.   He'll be impossible.

The women LAUGH. As Gerda looks up, Einar looks across,
smiles, trapped in his corner. Gerda nods back, reassuring,
conspiratorial. Then Einar's pulled back into the select
circle and Rasmussen emits a ridiculous barking LAUGH.EXT. COPENHAGEN STREET, NIGHTGerda and Einar, arm in arm, LAUGHING. Gerda wears a
distinctively embroidered fine wool wrap. Their FOOTSTEPS
ring down the empty street. A patina of crystallised brine
coats doorways, windows, scintillating in the moonlight.GERDAAnd Rasmussen...EINAROh, come on. Be kind.
             At least he agreed to see your work.GERDAOnly because he was drunk!EINARI know.GERDAYou were loving it!EINARI was not.

She mimics Rasmussen, his ludicrous excitement:GERDA"I don't say my client is the best
             landscape artist in Denmark..."(CONTINUED)26/11/153.CONTINUED:EINAR"But..."GERDA"He is in the top one!"

They LAUGH hard.     Someone calls from an upstairs window:MAN AT WINDOWHey - people are sleeping!

The window SLAMS. Gerda and Einar struggle to quieten down,
head for the dancing harbour lights - partners in crime.EXT. HARBOUR, NEXT MORNING- MAIN TITLES BEGIN -Fishermen selling straight off the boats to early-rising
customers. Prices are loudly negotiated as the silver catch
still writhes and flaps. A city coming to life.INT. THE WIDOW HOUSE, BEDROOM, MORNINGGerda carries in a breakfast tray. Einar sleeps. She observes
his face: long eyelashes, cheeks hollow in repose, delicate
lips. A little dog, HVAPPE, trots beside her. She puts down
the tray and throws back the bedcover. Einar blinks in the
light, surprised. He stretches, takes in the silhouetted
outline of his wife: tall, purposeful Gerda.GERDADo you know what time it is?

He smiles, sweetly suggestive of pleasure to come...EINARTime you came back to bed?GERDANo - I'm ready to start work.EINARDraw down the blinds.

She holds back, teases a little.GERDAI told you, I...EINARGerda...GERDAWhat?(CONTINUED)26/11/154.CONTINUED:She takes him in, smiling up at her.     Shakes her head.

             Your face... You think I can't resist
             you...EINARDo you want to resist me?

She approaches the edge of the bed, smiling herself now.GERDANo. But I'd like you to ask nicely
             so I don't feel such a pushover...

Einar reaches towards her.EINARGerda Wegener - my life, my wife...

He pulls her into bed... A skittish piano comes up as they
laugh, begin to make love. Continues over:EXT. STREET OUTSIDE COPENHAGEN OPERA HOUSEEinar crosses the road, heads for the Opera House.INT.

OPERA HOUSE, COSTUME SHOP, ONE MONTH LATER, DAYEinar walks between racks of clothes that hang in two tiers
so the ruffled and feathered hems of jewel-coloured gowns
brush his cheeks. An explicit sensual pleasure, which Einar
is conscious of but feels no need to investigate. He pauses.
The ARIA ceases, he hears women CHATTING, sometimes DROPPING
THEIR VOICES, emitting DIRTY LAUGHS, which make him smile and
wonder. A stolen intimacy. Einar spies on Ulla, below -ULLA (O.S.)Tighter!

Ulla is being pulled into a corset by a DRESSER. Einar leans
forward for a better view... She spots him - is delighted,
breaks free for a moment.(CONTINUED)26/11/155.CONTINUED:ULLA (cont'd)

             had eyes for one woman.EINARMy guilty secret's out.

He smiles at her, indulgent.      She calls up to him -ULLASo - when are you two going to breed me a
             godchild?EINARYou're an atheist.ULLAI'll reconsider.EINARWe're trying.ULLATry harder. I've been waiting an eternity.

Einar shakes his head.     She's impossible and he adores her.

             Anyway what are you doing in today? I

             storm scene. And give Gerda some space.ULLAAh - she's got a shy one.

Einar nods, smiles.     Ulla prepares to resume her fitting.

They LAUGH and Ulla signals to the dresser to pull at the
corset once more, smiles in delighted anticipation of the
discomfort to come.INT. WIDOW HOUSE, STUDIO, DAYMR FONNESBECH in a chair on a slightly raised dais. He is
formally dressed, somewhat stiff. The room is oppressively
still. Gerda looks up from her canvas, goes to adjust
Fonnesbech's arm. He is clearly affected by being touched,
embarrassed. She returns to the canvas. After an
uncomfortable couple of moments:FONNESBECHI wanted to say... I appreciate our being
             alone today. I hope your husband doesn't
             mind.GERDANot at all. I could see his being here
             made you uncomfortable.FONNESBECHIt wasn't personal.

Gerda smiles.      Shakes her head - he shouldn't worry:GERDAIt's not uncommon.FONNESBECHAh.

Fonnesbech's relieved.     Though he's left with questions.GERDAIt's hard for a man to be looked at by a
             woman. Women are used to it, of course,
             but for a man...

Mr Fonnesbech begins to look wildly vulnerable.

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             To... submit to a woman's gaze.   It's

He approaches, uses his thumb to gently blend away a smudge
of lipstick from her bottom lip. He nods. Perfect now.

He winces a little.   He has to end this:

          Gerda... I don't think it would benefit
          either of us to show these.

A vein begins to throb in Gerda's neck.

                    RASMUSSEN (cont'd)
          It's not a judgement on your abilities - I
          agree with Einar: you could be a first
          class painter if you found the right
          subject matter.

It's the first time Gerda's heard this.     Her eyes shine,
stung, betrayed.INT. WIDOW HOUSE, STUDIO, DAYEinar works, hears the door. Gerda brings in the portfolio,

Einar misses a beat.EINARI suppose I just haven't finished with it
             yet.

Gerda heads towards the door.

             about me again... My work is my business.

But she disappears into the bedroom, the door slamming
emphatically behind her. Einar's left bewildered.INT. BEDROOM, DAYGerda's already regretting the exchange with Einar. She
unfastens her dress, pulls it off. There's a bloodstain in
her underwear. Damn! She breathes.INT. STUDIO, DAYEinar working as Gerda reappears. She's composed now,
refocused, approaches her easel, organises her paints.      Einar
steals a look at her, but says nothing. Works on.

She turns to find him approaching.EINAROf course I am... You know I am.

A moment of quiet intimacy between them. Gerda shies away,
returns to present concerns... her work...(CONTINUED)26/11/1510.CONTINUED:GERDACould you help me with something?

Einar's relieved to be able to help.EINARAnything.GERDAUlla has an extra rehearsal. She cancelled
             again. Would you try on her stockings and
             shoes?

Einar's discomfort erupts in a laugh.       Is she serious?

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             I'm just so behind. I don't know how I'll
             be finished in time for her opening...

But he cuts her off:EINARI'll do it. It's fine.

Gerda sets a shoebox and the stocking on the sitter's chair,
goes into the kitchen. Einar moves the box and stockings,
sits in the chair on the dais. The dog leaps up -

                       EINAR (cont'd)
             No... no, not now Hvappe...

He pushes Hvappe down, tests the mesh of the stockings between his
fingers. He rolls up his trousers.

                       EINAR (cont'd)
             He almost snagged this...

Gerda marvels at his delicacy. Scolds the dog:GERDAHvappe...

Gerda mixes paints.      Einar battles with the stockings.

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             That's backwards...

He fiddles with the second stocking now, a light sweat dewing
his forehead by the time he's rolled both to the knee. He
opens a shoebox: - the yellow pair from the shop window.EINARI saw these in the window of
             Fonnesbech's...GERDASmart aren't they?(CONTINUED)26/11/1511.CONTINUED:EINARI don't think they'll fit...GERDAWell just do what you can.

He takes them out... Something catches in Einar's throat as
he pushes his toes into the shoe. Gerda's eyes are narrow as
she starts work. Einar looks down at his feet, partly
contained in the yellow suede, the disjuncture between the
body above and below the knee... he breathes... can't keep
his hands steady. Then:

                        GERDA (cont'd)
             No.   I need the dress.

They both look over to where Ulla's dress hangs. It is white,
weighted with beads at the hem and cuff. Beautiful.EINARGerda, I'm not putting it on.GERDAI haven't asked you to.

She get sit... lays it across him.

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             Would you just relax...? The sooner I
             start, the sooner I finish.

Einar yields reluctantly, as Gerda runs her fingers gently
down his face. Satisfied, Gerda returns to work.

Einar's breathing feels slightly laboured now. The dress
weighs heavily. His head moves slightly, feeling it brush at
his neck. His fingers curl involuntarily around the beaded
cuff. The SOUNDSCAPE becomes heightened: the creak of
Gerda's easel, the jangling of her bracelets, the sound of
the harbour, the wind in the ships' riggings. These combine,
fill his head... until:ULLA (O.S.)Well hello, there!

Einar starts... Ulla's in the doorway, delighted, with a huge
bunch of lilies. She starts to LAUGH, and because it's Ulla,
Gerda LAUGHS also. The dog YAPS, excited, confused. Einar's
disoriented. Gerda sees this, stops laughing, but...

                       ULLA (cont'd)
             Oh, don't worry my darling...

circles, Ulla's delight banishing the day's frustrations.EXT. HARBOUR, NIGHTThere are lights on in the Widow House.INT. WIDOW HOUSE, STUDIO, NIGHTGerda closes the book she's been reading, looks up to see
Einar, working, engrossed. An almost trance-like state. She
watches him a while, then approaches, rests her head against
his back. He's comfortable with this, but works on.GERDASuch concentration. Sometimes when you're
             working, I think you're going to slip
             through the surface of the painting and
             vanish.

He smiles a little.

Einar enjoys the memory for a moment.

             have a turn...GERDAHe's probably still sitting on a
             rock, sobbing his heart out.

Einar sets down his brush, turns toward her, away from his
work, smiles.EINARHe's a dealer in Paris, peddling
             Old Masters to rich Americans.GERDAOh. So we don't need to worry
             about Hans.EINARNo we don't.

             And don't worry, I won't disappear into the
