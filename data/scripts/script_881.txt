                           David TwohyBased on material by Ken and Jim WheatRevised First Draft3/3/98NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERSAND SOME "OMITTED" SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THISSOFT COPY.NOTE ALSO: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT WAS IN THE NON-PREFORMAT FONT "TIMES NEW ROMAN". THIS HAS BEEN CHANGEDTO PREFORMATTED TEXT FOR THIS SOFT COPY.Though mentioned often in the script, the creatures in PITCH BLACK are 
seldom seen at length; rather, they are glimpsed, they are heard, they are 
felt. They are, really, the embodiment of your nocturnal fears: A howling 
coyote that jars you awake; the painting on the wall that comes to life
when stared at too long...the sway of your bed just before the earthquake 
hits. Chimera of the night. The point is made so the reader appreciates
that the focus of the finished film will not be on what the creatures do, 
but on what the creatures do to reveal the inner nature of the characters. 
For PITCH BLACK is, at its heart, a story of humanity and courage -- and 
lack of the same.

     CAROLYN FRY. She hits the deck of the main cabin: Four crew
     lockers in a forward section, countless more in back. But the
     deck is canted at a sick angle and ALARMS SCREAM everywhere:
     The world is dying around her.

     Legs wobbly, shivering like a flu victim, Fry stumbles to the
     next forward locker. It's riddled with holes. One DEAD CREWIE
     is seen through fractured plexi, body pocked and bloodied. But
     in the next cryo-locked...

     The CAPTAIN is struggling awake. Fry's face floods with relief.
     Slapping an intercom:FRYHear me? Cap'n? Some kinda compromise to
               the hull...holding for now, but...Goddamn,
               I'm glad you're alive. Gotta pull your

     INSTRUMENTS on the opposite wall and leaving CONTRAILS
     HISSING in the air.

     Fry lands on her ass, horrified. Suddenly...

     Another LOCKER BLOWS OPEN. A body falls right on top of Fry --
     but this one's still alive. Disoriented, frantic:OWENSWhy did I fall on you?FRYHe's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was
               looking right at him when --OWENSI mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22

     from his, finding...

     Owens unbuckles from his chair.OWENSDon't touch that switch!

     Overcome by guilt, Fry retracts her thumb of mass destruction.

     Sunlight flares from every fractured edge: It's like looking
     into burning diamonds, and Fry can only get an impression
     of the outside world. Now she has to rely on...

     Johns. Ears running blood. Stumbling his way to...

     Riddick's cryo-locker. Empty. Johns reaches for his holster.
     Gone, torn right off his belt. No prisoner and no weapon --
     spooky combination. Nearby he sees...

     The light of a cutting torch. Someone's using it to open a
     jammed cryo-locker. The plexi is torched away to reveal...

     AUDREY, 12 years old. Unscathed.AUDREYSomethin' went wrong, huh?

     Johns searches for his pistol.Behind him, two chained feetlower into FRAME-- and then attack, swinging over Johns' head...
     getting the chain on his neck...twisting hard, using the chain as
     a choke-collar. Johns flicks open a baton, swings it up at...

     Riddick. Still in body chains and mouth-bit. Clinging to a
     ceiling support. Riding out the baton blows.

     Seconds from blacking out, Johns strains forward...forward...and
     finally breaks Riddick's grip on the support. He keeps hold of
     the chained feet so that...

     Riddick SLAMS HEADFIRST into the deck. Johns lays the baton on
     his neck.JOHNSOne chance and you blew it, Riddick.
               Never cease to disappoint me.INT. FLIGHT DECK - CRASH SHIP - DAYDarkness. A light beam sweeps the dusty air of the cockpit.
     It's packed with dirt, no signs of life. About to search
     elsewhere, Johns turns back at...FRY (O.S.)Hey.JOHNSHey, who?FRY (O.S.)Hey, me. Over here.

     His light finds a headrest sticking up from the dirt. Johns
     crawls closer, checks the other side of the headrest and finds
     her. Fry. Buried to the gills.JOHNSAmazing. I'm Johns.FRYCarolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...

     He manages a smile and starts digging her out. Almost dreading
     to ask:FRYAre there any others, Johns?INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAYJohns helps Fry through the carnage. She's stunned by it all --
     but especially by the blast of sunlight where a hull used to be.

     Realizing she's in nav-bay, Fry starts digging like a search dog
     to uncover...

     Owens. Still strapped to his chair. Metal rod piercing his
     chest close to the heart. Dead. Fry reaches out to touch him.OWENSOut, out, out, GET IT OUTTA ME!

     She recoils hard.He's still alive. The other survivors bungle
     over. Ten seconds of pure chaos:VOICESPull it out of him...No, it's too close to
               the heart...You gotta do it, just do it
               fast....

     But there is no more "that end." In exquisite pain, Owens
     screams on. REACTION SHOTS of Johns, Audrey. Seldom are human
     beings witness to such raw suffering.FRYGet away. Everybody.

     The others leave -- except for Audrey, staying behind to watch
     in morbid fascination. Johns doubles back and collars her.
     Leaving, they pass...

     goggles, track Johns and Audrey toward daylight.EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAYThe survivors straggle outside. CAMERA SURVEYS new faces:

     Fry and Imam. Sled chains on. Lapping up O2. Each holding a
     torch.

     Pilgrim #1. Clutching a handlight.

     Audrey. Rolling under her sled-shield, becoming the turtle in a
     metal carapace.

     Riddick. Goggles on. He has no desire to see what horrors will

     fast. Audrey speed-crawling beneath. Pilgrim #1 tripping along
     behind the shield. And Riddick behind them all, face already
     tortured, pulling 200 pounds of stubborn-mule cargo -- yet
     somehow keeping pace. The torch flames, stretched by the wind,

     Thin blue liquid spatters them.RIDDICKDonotlook up.

     More spattering. Fry looks up -- and stumbles when she beholds...A ceiling of predators. At the cusp of light, they dive and
     weave and dart, slashing each other in a rabid desire to SOUND
     OUT the humans below. It's like looking into a bucket of angry
     eels.RIDDICKKeep going, keep going, keep going,
               keep going!

     His voice whips them like the Devil's coxswain. Chastened, Fry
     keeps her eyes down and speed up.

     More blue blood showers down -- followed by entrails dropping
     out of the sky. Could this be Hell itself?IMAM(a muttered mantra)
               "So dark the clouds around my way

     Now WHOLE CORPSES ARE CRASHING DOWN around them, victims
     of in-fighting. Fry and Imam start slaloming through the ghastly
     mess.

     Pilgrim #1 passes too close to a corpse: A blade slices his leg,
     drawing blood. He keeps his mouth shut.EXT. CHOKE-POINT - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHTThe passage narrows into a choke-point. Fry sees it first.FRYRiddick? RIDDICK?

     Ahead,a clot of dead predators blocks the canyon.AUDREYWhat? What is it?RIDDICKIt's a fucking staircase! Go over it!GO OVER IT!Steeling themselves, they start climbing.

     But Audrey, on all fours, has to discover the corpses with herhands. Then, taking exception at being walked on...One "corpse" snaps at her. Audrey recoils sideways...

     And tumbles down the mound of corpses. She's exposed.

     PREDATORS' POV: Rapid-fire images of Audrey. Flashes from 10
     different predators.FRYAudrey!

     Audrey shakes out of it and scrambles for the shield just as...A predator kamikazes onto the shield, its bone-blades piercing
     the metal...

     And nearly skewering Audrey beneath.

     Caught in torchlight, steaming, the PREDATOR HOWLS as it tries
     to rip free of the shield.

     Beneath, Audrey hangs on and takes a thrashing.

     The predator tears clear, spins, pounces blindly at...

     Riddick, standing at light's edge. Stunningly,he catches thebeast under its scythe blades, blunting the attack. The predator
     CLICKS MADLY at him.

     PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick's face.

     The predator rears back its head, ready to bisect Riddick with
     its skull-blade.

     Switchblade fast, Riddick drops a hand...

     ...yanks his shiv...

     ...and sweeps it over the belly of the beast. HOWLING, the
     predator falls, disemboweled.

     unseen forces. He's still alive -- but shouldn't be. He makes
     a feeble attempt to grab onto Imam, to anyone, but he's gone

     of existence.EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHTThey flail on. And now, finally...finally....

     The canyon widens, opening up like some door to Heaven. The

     Circle of Hell. But then...

     Audrey hears PATTERING on the metal shield.
