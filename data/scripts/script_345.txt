          Aron freezes. SOMETHING is moving in the trees. He
          crouches. A dark blur. An animal? It moves off. He follows.
          The shape appears again. It's a SMALL GIRL, roughly Aron's
          age. Aron waves at her. The girl stares, then runs off.
          Aron hurries after her into a wooded grove, then stops short.A PILE OF NAKED CORPSES.Overflows a newly-dug trench. The small girl runs to A

          before he can get the gun off his shoulder. Stabbing him
          through his greatcoat, the BLADE BREAKS OFF IN HIS HAND.
          MEANWHILE, THE LIEUTENANT drops his cigarette, reaching
          under his coat for a pistol. Tuvia TACKLES him. The GUN
          skids away. They roll around on the road, CLAWING, PUNCHING,
          BITING. Tuvia SLAMS the man's head against the pavement.52 UP THE ROAD 52The Private sees Asael and Peretz coming at him. Jacov
          follows with his rifle. The Private turns and runs down
          the road. They give chase.53 FROM INSIDE THE CAR 53Another OFFICER is in the back seat with A WOMAN. He reaches
          for his gun, stands up in the seat and begins FIRING WILDLY

          advancing behind the tank -- to devastating effect.
          But now, the tank turns its attention to Tuvia. Its machine
          gun begins to chew up the forest, forcing Tuvia to take
          cover.
          Without pausing to think, Malbin grabs a grenade from the
          satchel and races toward the tank.
          It falls pitifully short, exploding harmlessly as Malbin is
          cut down.DOUBLE BLUE Revision - 9-17-07 108.173 TUVIA IS NOW ISOLATED AND PINNED DOWN 173Bullets tear chunks out of trees as he tries to take cover.THE TURRET SWIVELS IN HIS DIRECTIONIt is only a matter of moments before he is dead.WHEN SUDDENLY FROM OUT OF THE WOODSZus and the rest of Jewish fighters emerge, firing on the

          The German infantry is caught in a cross-fire as the Bielski
          brigade climbs out the river, firing wildly.
          Zus guns down the tank commander manning the machine gun
          from the open hatch. Jumps onto the tank and DROPS A GRENADE
          inside. An EXPLOSION of BLACK SMOKE BILLOWS.
          Zus stands up amid the billowing smoke. He sees Tuvia who
          is staring back at him.174 BOTH GROUPS MEET - THE DESTROYED TANK SMOLDERS NEARBY 174Asael is the first to reach Tuvia, who is carrying the German

          Nearby, Aron removes the machine from the tank and hands it
          to Zus. Bella approaches. Zus embraces her.
          Tuvia seizes one of the German rifles. He yells to Shulman.TUVIA (CONT'D)Shulman! Weapons only! Tell them.(CONTINUED)DOUBLE BLUE Revision - 9-17-07 108A.174 CONTINUED: 174Shulman follows Tuvia's order.TUVIA (CONT'D)(throwing the weapon)

          resting her head on his shoulder as they walk.
          Tuvia looks up at the shafts of light slanting through the
          towering trees, as if allowing himself to appreciate its
          beauty for the first time.
          Suddenly, he stops, listening, puzzled.TUVIADon't you hear it?ZUSWhat...?TUVIANothing. Isn't it beautiful?

          We might even see the ghost of a smile. But it is short-
          lived as Asael appears by his side and we see concern once
          again clouding his face. Another problem to attend to.
          And as THE CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL AWAY he is already hurrying
          to catch up with the others.
