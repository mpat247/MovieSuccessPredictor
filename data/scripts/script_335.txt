Dead Poets Society: Final ScriptINT. WELTON ACADEMY HALLWAY - DAYA young boy, dressed in a school uniform and cap, fidgets as his mother
adjusts his tie.MOTHERNow remember, keep your shoulders back.

A student opens up a case and removes a set of bagpipes. The young
boy and his brother line up for a photographPHOTOGRAPHEROkay, put your arm around your brother.
		That's it. And breathe in.

The young boy blinks as the flash goes off.PHOTOGRAPHROkay, one more.

An old man lights a single candle. A teacher goes over the old
man's duties.TEACHERNow just to review, you're going to
		follow along the procession until you
		get to the headmaster. At that point
		he will indicate to you to light the
		candles of the boys.MANAll right boys, let's settle down.

The various boys, including NEIL, KNOX, and CAMERON, line up holding
banners. Ahead of them is the old man, followed by the boy with the
bagpipes with the two youngest boys at the front.MANBanners up.

The boys hoist the banners and the bagpipes begin to play loudly. The
small group marches out of the room and down a set of stairs into a
church. The pews are filled with students and parents while the
teachers, all dressed in robes, are seated at the front of the church
behind the headmaster.

The boys break off to either side at the front of the church. The
bagpipes cease and the headmaster, MR. NOLAN, walks over to the old
man carrying the candle.MR NOLANLadies and gentlemen, boys, the light
		of knowledge.

An organ begins to play as the old man goes forward with shaking hands
to the young boys in the front pew. Each boy is holding a candle and
he bends over to light the first one. Each boy in turn lights the
candle of the boy next to him.MR NOLANOne hundred years ago, in 1859, 41 boys sat in this
		room and were asked the same question that greets
		you at the start of each semester. Gentlemen, what
		are the four pillars?

All throughout the pews, uniformed boys rise to their feet. TODD, who
is not wearing a uniform, is urged by his father to stand with them.BOYSTradition, honor, discipline, excellence.

The boys quickly return to their seats.MR NOLANIn her first year, Welton Academy graduated five
		students. Last year we graduated fifty-one. And
		more than seventy-five percent of those went on to
		the Ivy League. This, this kind of accomplishment is
		the result of fervent dedication to the principles taught
		here. This is why you parents have been sending us
		your sons. This is why we are the best preparatory
		school in the United States.

Mr. Nolan soaks up the applause from the audience.MR NOLANAs you know, our beloved Mr. Portius of the English
		department retired last term. You will have the
		opportunity later to meet his replacement, Mr. John
		Keating, himself a graduate of this school. And who,
		for the past several years, has been teaching at the
		highly regarded Chester School in London.

The crowd applauds once again.EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAYThe school lawn is a filled with luggage, students, and parents mulling
about in every direction.INT CHURCH ENTRANCE - DAYMr Nolan stands by the entrance, speaking with each family as they leave.MR NOLANGlad you could come by.MR ANDERSONThrilling ceremony as usual Dr. Nolan.MR NOLANYou've been away too long.MRS ANDERSONHello Dr. Nolan.MR NOLANGood to have you back.MRS ANDERSONThis is our youngest, Todd.MR NOLANMr. Anderson.You have some big shoes to fill,
		young man. Your brother was one of our finest.TODDThank you.

Todd and his parents leave while others file past Mr. Nolan.WOMANLovely ceremony.MR NOLANThank you. So glad you liked it.

MR PERRY approaches with his son Neil. He shakes Mr. Nolan's hand.MR PERRYGaleMR NOLANTomMR PERRYGood to see you again.NEILHello Mr. Nolan.MR NOLANNeil. We expect great things from you this year.NEILThank you, sir.MR PERRYWell he won't disappoint us. Right Neil?NEILI'll do my best sir.EXT SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAYA bell tolls. Parents begin wishing their boys farewell.FATHERHey, come on son.MOTHERChin up.FATHERNo tears now.BOYOkay.MOTHERChin up.

Another boy hugs his mother.BOYI don't want to go here.MOTHERYou be a good boy and do your lessons.EXT SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAYNeil emerges from a building and sees Todd.NEILHey, I hear we're gonna be roommates.

He shakes Todd's hand.NEILI'm Neil Perry.TODDTodd Anderson.NEILWhy'd you leave Balincrest?TODDMy brother went here.NEILOh, so you're that Anderson.INT DORMATORY - DAYDR. HAGER is standing in his room doorway while SPAZ and his father are
going over some last minute precautions over the boy's allergies. Spaz's
father hands Hager various bottles.FATHERThis is for sinuses. Oh, and if he can't swallow you
		give him one of these. And if he had trouble breathing
		you can give him some of those.HAGERAll right fine.

Dr. Hager takes the bottles and quickly backs into his room, shutting
the door.FATHER(to son)
		Did you remember your vaporizer?SPAZYes, I put it in my room.

Spaz's father tries to say something else to Dr. Hager but realizes he
has already gone.INT HALLWAY - DAYNeil pushes his way through a crowd of boys, carrying two suitcases. As
he enters his room, Knox quickly passes by.KNOXHey, how's it going Neil?NEILHey Knox.

Cameron comes by and leans against the doorway.CAMERONNeil, study group tonight?NEILYeah, sure.CAMERONBusiness as usual, huh? Hey, I hear you got the new
		kid. Looks like a stiff!

He begins laughing when he notices Todd coming into the room.CAMERONOops!

Cameron quickly leaves. Neil tries to keep from laughing as Todd enters
the room and sets his luggage down on his bed.NEILListen, don't mind Cameron. He was born with his
		foot in his mouth. You know what I mean?

He pulls some papers from his blazer pocket and playfully whacks Todd 
across the back with it.

CHARLIE comes to the door with a smug expression on his face. Knox and
MEEKS are close behind him. He points at NeilCHARLIERumor has it, you did summer school.NEILYep. Chemistry. My father thought I should get ahead.
		How was your summer Slick?CHARLIEKeen.

The boys enter the room. Charlie turns around and looks at Meeks who is
just entering.CHARLIEMeeks. Door. Closed.MEEKSYes sir.NEILGentlemen, what are the four pillars?BOYSTravesty. Horror. Decadence. Excrement.

Charlie makes himself comfortable on Neil's bed and lights up a cigarette.
Meanwhile, Todd is by his bed unpacking his luggage.CHARLIEOkay, study group. Meeks aced Latin. I didn't quite
		flunk English. So, if you want, we've got our study
		group.NEILSure. Cameron asked me too. Anyone mind
		including him?CHARLIEHmm, what's his specialty, boot-licking?NEILCome on, he's your roommate.CHARLIEThat's not my fault.

Meeks seems to notice Todd for the first time.MEEKSOh, I'm sorry, my name is Steven Meeks.

Neil quickly gets up from his spot by the window.NEILOh, this is Todd Anderson.

Todd turns around and shakes hands with Meeks.MEEKSNice to meet you.TODDNice to meet you.CHARLIECharlie Dalton.

Charlie continues to lay on the bed, looking smug. Knox extends a hand.KNOXKnox Overstreet.NEILTodd's brother was Jeffrey Anderson.CHARLIEOh yeah, sure. Valedictorian. National merit scholar.MEEKSOh well, welcome to Hell-ton.CHARLIEIt's every bit as tough as they say, unless you're a
		genius like Meeks.MEEKSHe flatters me. That's why I help him with Latin.CHARLIEAnd English, and Trig.

Charlie begins coughing. There is a knock at the door. Charlie quickly
stamps out his cigarette on the floor and Neil tries to wave the smoke
from the air.NEILIt's open.

The door opens and Mr. Perry walks into the room. Neil quickly rises from
the window.NEILFather, I thought you'd gone.

The other boys stand up when he enters.BOYSMr. Perry.MR PERRYKeep your seats fellows, keep your seats. Neil, I've
		just spoken to Mr. Nolan. I think that you're taking
		too many extra curricular activities this semester, and
		I've decided that you should drop the school annual.NEILBut I'm the assistant editor this year.MR PERRYWell I'm sorry Neil.NEILBut Father, I can't. It wouldn't be fair.MR PERRYFellas, would you excuse us for a moment?

Mr. Perry walks towards the door and Neil hesitantly follows. Mr. Perry
pauses by the door and smiles to the other boys.INT. HALLWAY - DAYThe smile has gone from Mr. Perry's face. He grabs a hold of Neil's arm.MR PERRYDon't you ever dispute me in public. Do you
		understand?NEILFather, I wasn't disputing-MR PERRYAfter you've finished medical school and you're on your own, then you
can do as you damn well please. But until then, you do as I tell you.
Is that clear?NEILYes sir. I'm sorry.MR PERRYYou know how much this means to your mother,
		don't you?NEILYes sir. You know me, always taking on too much.MR PERRYWell, that's my boy. Now listen, you need anything,
		you let us know, huh?NEILYes sir.

Mr. Perry slaps his son on the shoulder and leaves. Neil leans his head
back against the wall as the other boys emerge from the room.CHARLIEWhy doesn't he let you do what you want?KNOXYeah Neil, tell him off. It couldn't get any worse.NEILOh, that's rich. Like you guys tell your parents off, Mr.
		Future Lawyer and Mr. Future Banker.CHARLIEOkay, so I don't like it any more than you do.NEILWell just don't tell me how to talk to my father. You
		guys are the same way.KNOXAll right, all right, Jesus. So what are you going to do?NEILWhat I have to do. Drop the annual.CHARLIEWell I wouldn't lose much sleep over it. It's just a
		bunch of jerks trying to impress Nolan.NEILI don't care. I don't give a damn about any of it.MEEKSWell, uh, Latin, eight o' clock in my room?NEILYes.MEEKSTodd, you're welcome to join us.KNOXYeah, come along pal.

Todd looks up from his desk where he is setting his alarm clock.TODDThanks.EXT. FIELDS - DAYA clock bell chimes five o'clock. Enormous flocks of birds, apparently
disturbed by the noise, take to the sky.INT. STAIRCASE - DAYThe sound of squawking birds merges into the sound of noisy boys as they
descend the stairs in a long spiralling line.

MR. MCALLISTER tries to make it upstairs against the steady stream.MCALLISTERSlow down boys, slow down you horrible
		phalanx of pubescense.INT CHEMISTRY LAB - DAYA teacher walks up and down the aisles, handing out books.TEACHERPick three laboratory experiments from
		the project list and report on them every
		five weeks. The first twenty questions at
		the end of chapter one are due tomorrow.

The students let out a collective groan.INT. LATIN CLASSROOM - DAYMr. McAllister paces back and forth in front of the blackboard and gets
the students to repeat everything he says.MCALLISTER(students repeat after each word.)
		Agricolam. Agricola. Agricolae.
		Agricolarum. Agricolis. Agricolas.
		Agrilcolis.

		Again, please.
		Agricola.INT. MATH CLASSROOM - DAYDr. Hager walks up the classroom aisles with his arms behind his back.HAGERYour study of trigonometry requires absolute precision.
		Anyone failing to turn in any homework assignment will
		be penalized one point off their final grade. Let me urge
		you now not to test me on this point.INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAYStudents enter Keating's classroom, talking and acting up. Keating
glances out from his room off to one side.KNOXHey Spaz, Spaz.

Spaz turns around in time to be hit by a ball of crumpled up paper
while Cameron smacks him on the shoulder.CAMERONBrain damage.

The students quickly quiet down as Keating emerges from the other room,
whistling the 1812 Overture. He walks up the length of the classroom and
out the door without a word. The students look around at one another,
uncertain of what to do. Keating pokes his head back in the doorway.KEATINGWell come on.

He gestures them to follow and the students, after some hesitation, grab
their books and follow Keating out into the main entranceway.INT. ENTRANCEWAY - DAYKeating stands before the school's trophy cabinets and waits until all
the boys arrive.KEATING"Oh Captain, My Captain" who knows where
		that comes from?

Todd looks up as if he knows the answer, but says nothing. Spaz blows his
nose a little too close to Meeks for his liking.KEATINGNot a clue? It's from a poem by Walt
		Whitman about Mr. Abraham Lincoln. Now in
		this class you can call me Mr. Keating. Or,
		if you're slightly more daring, Oh Captain,
		My Captain.

The students laugh slightly.KEATINGNow let me dispel a few rumors so they
		don't fester into facts. Yes, I too
		attended Hell-ton and survived. And no,
		at that time I was not the mental giant
		you see before you. I was the intellectual
		equivalent of a ninety-eight pound
		weakling. I would go to the beach and
		people would kick copies of Byron in my
		face.

The boys laugh once again, while Cameron, obviously trying to write all
this down, looks around confusedly. Keating looks down at papers in his
hand.KEATINGNow, Mr� Pitts. That's a rather
		unfortunate name. Mr. Pitts, where are
		you?

Pitts raises his hand while everyone around him snickers.KEATINGMr. Pitts, would you open your hymnal to page 542 and read the first
stanza of the poem you find there?PITTS"To the virgins, to make much of time"?KEATINGYes, that's the one. Somewhat appropriate,
		isn't it.PITTS"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, old
		time is still a flying, and this same
		flower that smiles today, tomorrow will
		be dying."KEATINGThank you Mr. Pitts. "Gather ye rosebuds
		while ye may." The Latin term for that
		sentiment is Carpe Diem. Now who knows
		what that means?

Meeks immediately puts his hand up.MEEKSCarpe Diem. That's "seize the day."KEATINGVery good, Mr.-MEEKSMeeks.KEATINGMeeks. Another unusual name. Seize the
		day. Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.
		Why does the writer use these lines?CHARLIEBecause he's in a hurry.KEATINGNo, ding!

Keating slams his hand down on an imaginary buzzer.KEATINGThank you for playing anyway. Because we
		are food for worms lads. Because, believe
		it or not, each and every one of us in
		this room is one day going to stop
		breathing, turn cold, and die. 

Keating turns towards the trophy cases, filled with trophies, footballs,
and team pictures.KEATINGNow I would like you to step forward over
		here and peruse some of the faces from
		the past. You've walked past them many
		times. I don't think you've really looked
		at them.

The students slowly gather round the cases and Keating moves behind them.KEATINGThey're not that different from you, are
		they? Same haircuts. Full of hormones,
		just like you. Invincible, just like you
		feel. The world is their oyster. They
		believe they're destined for great things,
		just like many of you. Their eyes are full
		of hope, just like you. Did they wait until
		it was too late to make from their lives
		even one iota of what they were capable?
		Because you see gentlmen, these boys are
		now fertilizing daffodils. But if you listen
		real close, you can hear them whisper their
		legacy to you. Go on, lean in.

The boys lean in and Keating hovers over Cameron's shoulder.KEATING(whispering in a gruff voice)
		Carpe.

Cameron looks over his shoulder with an aggravated expression on his face.KEATINGHear it?
			    (whispering again)
		Carpe. Carpe Diem. Seize the day boys,
		make your lives extraordinary.

The boys stare at the faces in the cabinet in silence.EXT. SCHOOL STEPS - DAYThe boys emerge from the school, loaded down with numerous books.PITTSThat was weird.NEILBut different.KNOXSpooky if you ask me.CAMERONThink he'll test us on that stuff?CHARLIECome on Cameron, don't you get anything?CAMERONWhat? What?INT. LOCKER ROOM - EVENINGA coach sticks his head around the corner into the room.COACHLet's go boys, hustle up in here. That
		means you Dalton.

Meeks emerges from the showers, drying himself off.MEEKSOkay, who's up for a trig study group
		tonight guys?PITTSMe.NEILMe.CHARLIE(still annoyed by what the coach said)
		What?KNOXI can't make it guys. I have to have
		dinner at the Danburry's house.PITTSThe Danburry's? Who are the Danburry's?CAMERONBig alumns. How'd you swing that?KNOXFriends of my Dad's. They're probably in
		their nineties or something.CHARLIEOoh!NEILAnything's better than Hell-ton hash.CHARLIEI'll second that.KNOXYeah we'll see.

Neil approaches Todd, who's been sitting by the window staring down at the
floor. Neil snaps his fingers to get Todd's attention.NEILHey, you coming to the study group tonight?TODDUh, no, no I, uh, I've got some history I
		wanna do.NEILSuit yourself.INT. TODD'S ROOM - EVENINGTodd is seated at his desk. He scrawls "CARPE DIEM" across a blank page
of his notebook. He looks at it for a few moments before crumpling it up
and opening up his Chemistry book.INT. ENTRANCEWAY - NIGHTHager comes down the stairs. Knox is looking at one of the old class photos
on the walls.HAGERReady Overstreet?

Knox reluctantly follows after Dr. Hager.KNOXReady to go sir.EXT. ROAD - NIGHTThe car leaves Welton and drives towards the Danburry's house.INT / EXT DANBURRY'S HOUSE - NIGHTThe doorbell rings.MRS DANBURRY (O.S.)Chet, can you get that?CHET (O.S.)I can't, Mom.CHRIS (O.S.)I'll get it.

The door opens and Knox is awe-struck by the beautiful girl (CHRIS) who
has answered the door.CHRISCan I help you?

Knox manages to break out of his daze.KNOXHi. Knox Overstreet. Uh, Dr. Hager.CHRISHi.KNOXThis is the Danburry's, right?CHRISAre you here to see Chet?KNOXMrs. Danburry?

Chris begins to laugh as Mrs. Danburry arrives behind her.CHRISNo.MRS DANBURRYSorry. Thank you Chris. I'm Mrs. Danburry.
		You must be Knox.KNOXYes.MRS DANBURRY(to Dr. Hager)
		Back by nine.
			    (to Knox)
		Please come in.CHET (O.S.)Chris, come on, what are you doing?CHRISChet, I'm coming.

Knox enters the house, his mind still hung up on Chris as MR DANBURRY
comes out of the living room to meet him.MR DANBURRYKnox. How are you? Joe Danburry.KNOXNice to meet you sir.MR DANBURRYWell he's the spitting image of his father,
		isn't he. How is he? Come on in.CHET (O.S.)Chris!KNOXHe's great. He just did a big case for GM.CHRIS (O.S.)I'm coming.MR DANBURRYI know where you're headed, like father
		like son, huh?INT. STUDENT LOUNGE - NIGHTSeveral students are throwing darts at a small rubber skeleton hanging
from the bulletin board. Various students are studying and playing games.
Meeks and Pitts are sitting at one table working on their "hi-fi system".
Meeks is waving an antenna around with no luck. Pitts points out to him
that he forgot to plug it in. Neil, Cameron, and Charlie are working on
their trig homework.CAMERONJust replace these numbers here with "x",
		for "x" and "y".NEILOf course.CAMERONOf course, so what's the problem?

Charlie enters the room and closes the door behind him, leaning up
against it heavily.CHARLIEHow was dinner?KNOXHuh?CHARLIEHow was dinner?KNOXTerrible. Awful.

He leaves the door and sits down with the other boys.CHARLIEWhy? What happened?KNOXTonight, I met the most beautiful girl
		in my entire life.NEILAre you crazy? What's wrong with that?KNOXShe's practically engaged. To Chet Danburry.CHARLIEThat guy could eat a football.PITTSThat's too bad.KNOXToo bad? It's worse than too bad Pitsie,
		it's a tragedy. A girl this beautiful in
		love with such a jerk.PITTSAll the good ones go for jerks, you
		know that.CAMERONAhh, forget her. Open your trig book and
		try and figure out problem five.KNOXI can't just forget her Cameron. And I
		can't think about trig.

The radio Meeks and Pitts were working on begins letting out a high
pitched hum.PITTSWe got it.MEEKSHoly cow.

Mr. Hager walks into the room.HAGERAll right gentlemen, five minutes. Let's
		go.

The students quickly pack up their gear and prepare to leave. Pitts tries
to hide the radio in his lap. Charlie leans in close to Knox.CHARLIEDid you see her naked?KNOXVery funny Dalton.HAGERThat wouldn't be a radio in your lap,
		would it Mr. Pitts?PITTSNo sir. Science experiment, radar.

Meeks holds up the antenna as if demonstrating it.INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAYKeating sits at his desk at the front of the classroom and opens up one
of his books.KEATINGGentlemen, open your text to page
		twenty-one of the introduction. Mr.
		Perry, will you read the opening
		paragraph of the preface, entitled
		"Understanding Poetry"?NEILUnderstanding Poetry, by Dr. J. Evans
		Pritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand
		poetry, we must first be fluent with
		its meter, rhyme, and figures of speech.
		Then ask two questions: One, how artfully
		has the objective of the poem been
		rendered, and two, how important is that
		objective. Question one rates the poem's
		perfection, question two rates its
		importance. And once these questions have
		been answered, determining a poem's
		greatest becomes a relatively simple
		matter.

Keating gets up from his desk and prepares to draw on the chalk board.NEILIf the poem's score for perfection is
		plotted along the horizontal of a graph,
		and its importance is plotted on the
		vertical, then calculating the total
		area of the poem yields the measure of
		its greatness.

Keating draws a corresponding graph on the board and the students
dutifully copy it down.NEILA sonnet by Byron may score high on the
		vertical, but only average on the
		horizontal. A Shakespearean sonnet, on
		the other hand, would score high both
		horizontally and vertically, yielding a
		massive total area, thereby revealing the
		poem to be truly great. As you proceed
		through the poetry in this book, practice
		this rating method. As your ability to
		evaluate poems in this matter grows, so
		will - so will your enjoyment and
		understanding of poetry.

Neil sets the book down and takes off his glasses. The student sitting
across from him is discretely trying to eat. Keating turns away from
the chalkboard with a smile.KEATINGExcrement. That's what I think of Mr. J.
		Evans Pritchard. We're not laying pipe,
		we're talking about poetry.

Cameron looks down at the graph he copied into his notes and quickly
scribbles it out.KEATINGI mean, how can you describe poetry like
		American Bandstand? I like Byron, I give
		him a 42, but I can't dance to it.

Charlie suddenly appear to become interested in the class.KEATINGNow I want you to rip out that page.

The students look at Keating as if he has just gone mad.KEATINGGo on, rip out the entire page. You heard
		me, rip it out. Rip it out!

Charlie looks around at the others. He then looks down at his own notes,
which consists of drawing breasts.KEATINGGo on, rip it out.

Charlie rips the page out and holds it up.KEATINGThank you Mr. Dalton. Gentlemen, tell you
		what, don't just tear out that page, tear
		out the entire introduction. I want it
		gone, history. Leave nothing of it. Rip
		it out. Rip! Begone J. Evans Pritchard,
		Ph.D. Rip, shred, tear. Rip it out. I
		want to hear nothing but ripping of Mr.
		Pritchard.

Meeks looks around reluctantly and then finally begins tearing out pages.KEATINGWe'll perforate it, put it on a roll.

Keating sees Cameron still hesitating.KEATINGIt's not the bible, you're not going to
		go to hell for this. Go on, make a clean
		tear, I want nothing left of it.

Keating goes over to his room. Cameron turns around to Neil.CAMERONWe shouldn't be doing this.NEILRip, rip, rip!

Neil makes Cameron turn back around.KEATING (O.S.)Rip it out, rip!

From outside the classroom, Mr. McAllister hears all the noise and sees
all the students ripping out the pages. He bursts into the room.MCALLISTERWhat the hell is going on here?

The boys all turn around in shock. Charlie stuffs a crumpled page into his
mouth. Keating emerges from his room with a waste paper basket.KEATINGI don't hear enough rips.MCALLISTERMr. Keating.KEATINGMr. McAllister.MCALLISTERI'm sorry, I- I didn't know you were
		here.KEATINGI am.MCALLISTERAhh, so you are. Excuse me.

Mr. McAllister slowly backs out of the classroom.KEATINGKeep ripping gentlemen. This is a battle,
		a war. And the casualties could be your
		hearts and souls. 

Keating holds out the basket to Charlie who spits out a wad of paper.KEATINGThank you Mr. Dalton. Armies of academics
		going forward, measuring poetry. No, we
		will not have that here. No more of Mr.
		J. Evans Pritchard. Now in my class you
		will learn to think for yourselves again.
		You will learn to savor words and language.
		No matter what anybody tells you, words and
		ideas can change the world. I see that look
		in Mr. Pitt's eye, like nineteenth century
		literature has nothing to do with going to
		business school or medical school. Right?
		Maybe. Mr. Hopkins, you may agree with him, 
		thinking "Yes, we should simply study our
		Mr. Pritchard and learn our rhyme and meter
		and go quietly about the business of
		achieving other ambitions." I have a little
		secret for ya. Huddle up. Huddle up! 

The boys get up from their seats and gather around Keating in the center
of the class.KEATINGWe don't read and write poetry because
		it's cute. We read and write poetry
		because we are members of the human race.
		And the human race is filled with passion.
		Medicine, law, business, engineering,
		these are all noble pursuits, and necessary
		to sustain life. But poetry, beauty,
		romance, love, these are what we stay alive
		for. To quote from Whitman: "O me, o life
		of the questions of these recurring, of the
		endless trains of the faithless, of cities
		filled with the foolish. What good amid
		these, o me, o life? Answer: that you are
		here. That life exists, and identity.
		That the powerful play goes on, and you
		may contribute a verse. That the powerful
		play goes on and you may contribute a verse.

Keating looks up at Todd.

				Keating
		What will your verse be?INT. HEAD OF CAFETERIA - DAYThe cafeteria is filled with students and teachers standing before the tables saying grace.ALLFor what we are about to receive, may the
		Lord make us truly grateful. Amen.

Mr. Keating and Mr. McAllister are seated next to one another at the table.MCALLISTERQuite an interesting class you gave today,
		Mr. Keating.KEATINGI'm sorry if I shocked you, Mr. McAllister.MCALLISTEROh, there's no need to apologize. It was
		very fascinating, misguided though it was.KEATINGYou think so?MCALLISTERYou take a big risk by encouraging them to
		be artists John. When they realize they're
		not Rembrandts, Shakespeares or Mozarts,
		they'll hate you for it.KEATINGWe're not talking artists George, we're
		talking free thinkers.MCALLISTERFree thinkers at seventeen?KEATINGFunny, I never pegged you as a cynic.MCALLISTER(taken aback by the comment)
		Not a cynic, a realist. Show me the heart
		unfettered by foolish dreams, and I'll
		show you a happy man.KEATINGBut only in their dreams can man be truly
		free. 'Twas always thus, and always thus
		will be.MCALLISTERTennyson?KEATINGNo, Keating.

Keating winks and Mr. McAllister can't help but laugh.INT. CAFETERIA TABLE - DAYNeil joins the others at the table. He pulls out a yearbook.NEILHey, I found his senior annual in the
		library.

He hands the annual over to Cameron who laughs at the younger picture of Keating.NEILListen to this, captain of the soccer team,

Cameron quickly puts the annual away and the others all return to their meal.EXT. WELTON GROUNDS - DAYKeating is walking down towards the lake, whistling the same tune as before.
The boys emerge from the building and chase after him.NEILMr. Keating? Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain,
		My Captain?

Keating immediately turns around.KEATINGGentlemen.NEILWe were just looking in your old annual.

He hands Keating the annual and Keating looks at his old photograph.KEATINGOh my God. No, that's not me. Stanley
		"The Tool" Wilson-

Keating crouches down and continues looking through the book.KEATINGGod.

Neil crouches down next to Keating.NEILWhat was the Dead Poets Society?KEATINGI doubt the present administration would
		look too favorably upon that.NEILWhy? What was it?KEATINGGentlemen, can you keep a secret?NEILSure.

The other boys crouch down around Keating.KEATINGThe Dead Poets were dedicated to sucking
		the marrow out of life. That's a phrase
		from Thoreau that we'd invoke at the
		beginning of each meeting. You see we'd
		gather at the old Indian cave and take
		turns reading from Thoreau, Whitman,
		Shelley; the biggies. Even some of our
		own verse. And in the enchantment of the
		moment we'd let poetry work its magic.KNOXYou mean it was a bunch of guys sitting
		around reading poetry?KEATINGNo Mr. Overstreet, it wasn't just "guys",
		we weren't a Greek organization, we were
		romantics. We didn't just read poetry,
		we let it drip from our tongues like honey.
		Spirits soared, women swooned, and gods
		were created, gentlemen, not a bad way to
		spend an evening eh? Thank you Mr. Perry
		for this trip down amnesia lane. Burn that,
		especially my picture.

Keating hands the annual back and walks away, whistling once again. Neil
remains crouched.NEILDead Poets Society.CAMERONWhat?

The school bells begin ringing and everyone heads back towards the school.
Neil stands up.NEILI say we go tonight.CHARLIETonight?CAMERONWait a minute.PITTSWhere's this cave he's talking about?NEILIt's beyond the stream. I know where it

		be careful, we can't get caught.CHARLIENo shit, Sherlock.HAGER(yelling)

Neil turns around and faces the other boys.NEILAll right, who's in?CAMERONCome on Neil, Hager's right-NEILForget Hager, no. Who's in?CHARLIEI'm in.HAGER (O.S.)I'm warning you, move.CAMERONMe too.PITTSI don't know NeilNEILWhat?

The boys run into the building.CHARLIEWhat about you Knox?KNOXI don't know Charlie.CHARLIECome on Knox, it'll help you get Chris.KNOXYeah? How?CHARLIEWomen swoon.

Charlie laughs and runs inside. Knox chases after him.KNOXBut why do they swoon? Charlie, tell me
		why they swoon. Charlie!INT LIBRARY - DAYThe boys are all gathered around one of the tables with a map laid out
on it.NEIL(whispering)
		Okay, follow the stream to the waterfall.
		It's right there. It's got to be on the
		banks.CAMERONI don't know, it's starting to sound
		dangerous.CHARLIEWell, why don't you stay home?MCALLISTERFor God's sake stop chattering and
		sit down.

The boys take their seats once again and Neil goes over and sits next to
Todd, who is sitting by himself.NEILTodd, are you coming tonight?TODDNo.NEILWhy not? God, you were there. You heard
		Keating. Don't you want to do something
		about it?TODDYes, but-NEILBut? But what?TODDKeating said that everybody took turns
		reading and I don't want to do that.NEILGosh, you really have a problem with
		that, don't you?TODDN- no, I don't have a problem. Neil,
		I just- I just don't want to do it,
		okay?NEILAll right. What if you didn't have to
		read? What if you just came and
		listened?TODDThat's not how it works.NEILForget how it works. What if - what if
		they said it was okay?TODDWhat? What are you gonna do, go up and
		ask them?

Neil shrugs.TODDNo. No, Neil.NEILI'll be right back.TODDNeil, Neil!

Neil gets up and rejoins the others. McAllister hears the boys whispering
again.MCALLISTEROh shut up, will you.INT BATHROOM - NIGHTVarious boys are crowded around the sinks getting ready for bed. Someone
is playing snake charmer music on a kazoo while someone else is bothering
Spaz with a red sock puppet acting like a snake.SPAZThat's my- that's for my asthma, okay.
		Could you give that back please? Could
		you give that back?BOYWhat's the matter? Don't you like snakes?

Neil enters and taps Todd on the shoulder.NEILYou're in.SPAZGet away from me, okay?BOYSpaz, why don't you check your pocket,
		huh? Come on Spaz I have to brush my
		teethSPAZGet a- get off, 

Hager walks past the bathroom and into his room.HAGERCut out that racket in there.

The kazoo player lets out a rude squeek before finally stopping. Hager
glares at them for a moment.INT NEIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHTNeil stands in his doorway. He looks across the hall to the other room
where Cameron and Charlie are standing. Cameron gives a thumbs up. Neil
closes his room door and takes out his cloak and a flashlight. Setting
the flashlight down on the desk, he notices a worn book, "Five
Centuries of Verse", sitting there. Opening it up, he sees John Keating's
name at the top followed by "Dead Poets". Below the title of the book,
is written: "To Be Read At The Opening of D.P.S. Meetings." Along with
several lines from Thoreau, beginning with "I went to the woods because
I wanted to live deliberately�"INT STAIRWAY - NIGHTThe shadows of hooded figures can be seen moving throughout the darkened
halls.INT HAGER'S ROOM - NIGHTHager hears a dog barking.INT HALLWAY - NIGHTSomeone drops a number of dog biscuits by the dog's feet. He stops
barking and immediately begins gobbling them down. Hager looks out
into the hallway with his flashlight but sees nothing.EXT SCHOOL GROUNDS - NIGHTThe boys quietly leave the building and set off running across the
fields towards the woods.EXT WOODS - NIGHTThe boys search about the trees trying to find the cave. Meeks is
searching around when Charlie leaps up behind Meeks in the dark
shining the flashlight up at his own face and grabs Meeks by the
shoulder.CHARLIEArrr, I'm a dead poet.MEEKSAww, Charlie.CHARLIE(laughing)
		Guys, over here.MEEKSYou're funny. You're real funny.INT CAVE - NIGHTThe boys are trying to start a fire. The cave is quickly filling up with
smoke.MEEKSIt's too wet.CHARLIEGod, are you trying to smoke us out of
		here?MEEKSNo, no, the smoke's going right up this
		opening.

Pitts tries to stand up and slams his head into the low rock ceiling. He
lets out a yell while the others laugh.NEILYou okay?PITTSOh God. Clowns.NEILAll right, all right, forget the fire.
		Let's go gentlemen.

Neil stands before the others with the book in hand, and takes a drag
on a cigarette.NEILI hereby reconvene the Dead Poets
		Society.

The boys cheer.NEILWelton chapter. The meetings will be
		conducted by myself and the other new
		initiates now present. Todd Anderson,
		because he prefers not to read, will
		keep minutes of the meetings. I'll now
		read the traditional opening message by
		society member Henry David Thoreau. "I
		went to the woods because I wanted to
		live deliberately. I wanted to live deep
		and suck out all the marrow of life."CHARLIEI'll second that.NEIL"To put to rout all that was not life,
		and not, when I had come to die,
		discover that I had not lived.

Several boys whistle softly in reaction to the poem.NEILAnd Keating's marked a bunch of other
		pages.

Neil begins flipping through the book.CHARLIEAll right, intermission. Dig deep right
		here. Right here, lay it downCAMERONOn the mud? We're gonna put our food on
		the mud?CHARLIEMeeks, put your coat down. Picnic blanket.MEEKSYes sir, use Meeks' coat.CHARLIEDon't keep anything back either. You
		guys are always bumming my smokes.

Meeks lays his coat down and everyone dumps their food on it. Amongst
the pile are chocolate chip cookies, a box of raisins, a few apples, an
orange, and half a roll.NEILRaisins?KNOXYuck.CHARLIEWait a minute, who gave us half a roll?PITTS(talking with his mouth full)
		I'm eating the other half.CHARLIECome on.PITTSYou want me to put it back?INT CAVE - NIGHTNeil, lit up by a flashlight, begins to tell everyone a story.NEILIt was a dark and rainy night, and this
		old lady, who had a passion for jigsaw
		puzzles, sat by herself in her house at
		her table to complete a new jigsaw puzzle.
		But as she pieced the puzzle together, she
		realized, to her astonishment, that the
		image that was formed was her very own
		room. And the figure in the center of the
		puzzle, as she completed it, was herself.
		And with trembling hands, she placed the
		last four pieces and stared in horror at
		the face of a demented madman at the
		window. The last thing that this old lady
		ever heard was the sound of breaking glass.BOYSOhhh� no�NEILThis is true, this is true.CAMERONI've got one that's even better than
		that.CHARLIEHa!CAMERONI do. There's a young, married couple,
		and they're driving through the forest
		at night on a long trip. And they run
		out of gas, and there's a madman on the-CHARLIEThe thing with the hand-

All the boys react, recalling the story and miming the scraping on the
roof of the car.CAMERONI love that story.CHARLIEI told you that one.CAMERONYou did not. I got that in camp in
		sixth grade.CHARLIEWhen were you in six, last year?

As everyone's voices begin to calm down, Pitts begins reading from the
book.PITTS"In a mean abode in the shanking road,
		lived a man named William Bloat. Now,
		he had a wife, the plague of his life,
		who continually got his goat. And one
		day at dawn, with her nightshift on,
		he slit her bloody throat."

The boys laugh.PITTSOh, and it gets worse.CHARLIEYou want to hear a real poem?

Meeks hands Charlie the book but he shoves it away.CHARLIEAll right? No, I don't need it. You take 
		it.MEEKSWhat, did you bring one?NEILYou memorized a poem?CHARLIEI didn't memorize a poem. Move up.

Neil moves to the side as Charlie stands and takes his spot.MEEKSAn original piece by Charlie Dalton.KNOXAn original piece.PITTSTake center stage.NEILYou know this is history. Right? This is 
		history.

Charlie clears his throat and pulls out a page from a magazine and 
slowly unfolds it, revealing a Playboy centerfold (Elaine Reynolds,
Miss October, 1959)MEEKSOh, wow.CAMERONWhere did you get that?CHARLIETeach me to love? Go teach thyself more 
		wit.
		I, chief professor, am of it.

Neil gets up and looks over Charlie's shoulder to see what he is
reading.CHARLIEThe god of love, if such a thing there 
		be, may learn to love from me.

Charlie winks at the guys and they clap and cheer.NEILWow! Did you write that?

Charlie turns over the centerfold to show where he had written down
the poem.CHARLIEAbraham Cowley. Okay, who's next? 

Neil sits reading from the book by flashlight.NEILAlfred Lord Tennyson. 
		Come my friends, 
		'Tis not too late to seek a newer world 
		for my purpose holds to sail beyond the

		And though we are not now that strength

		are, we are;-- 
		One equal temper of heroic hearts, 
		Made weak by time and fate, but strong 
		in will. 
		To strive, to seek, to find, and not to 
		yield. 

Meeks takes center stage and begins reading a poem like he is 
performing a chant.MEEKSThen I had religion, then I had a 
		vision. 
		I could not turn from their revel in 
		derision. 
		Then I saw the Congo creeping through 
		the black,

Knox picks up a metal container and begins using it as a drum. The
other boys stand and begin going in a circle, making music with
sticks of wood, combs, etc.

		Then I saw the Congo creeping through

The boys continue to chant the chorus as they emerge from the
cave.EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHTThe clock tolls two as the boys silently run back to their dorm.INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAYKeating is walking to the front of the classroom filled with students.KEATINGA man is not very tire, he is exhausted.
		And don't use very sad, use-

He points to the back of the classroom.KEATINGCome on, Mr. Overstreet, you twerp,KNOXMorose?KEATINGExactly! Morose. Now, language was 
		developed for one endeavor, and that is? 
		Mr. Anderson? Come on! Are you a man or 
		an amoeba?

Keating stands before Todd's desk. Todd looks up nervously but
says nothing. Keating paused for a moment before looking away.KEATINGMr. Perry?NEILUh, to communicate.KEATINGNo! To woo women. Today we're going to 
		be talking about William Shakespeare. 

The class lets out a collective sigh.BOYOh, God!KEATINGI know. A lot of you looked forward to 
		this about as much as you look forward 
		to root canal work. We're gonna talk 
		about Shakespeare as someone who writes 
		something very interesting. Now, many of 
		you have seen Shakespeare done very much 
		like this:

Keating holds out his right arm dramtically and begins to
speak in an exaggerated British accent.

		"O Titus, bring your friend hither." But
		if any of you have seen Mr. Marlon Brando,
		you know, Shakespeare can be different. 
		"Friend, Romans, countrymen, lend me your
		ears." You can also imagine, maybe, John
		Wayne as Macbeth going, "Well, is this a 
		dagger I see before me?"INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAYThe students are all seated together near the front of the room as
Keating reads from a book.KEATING"Dogs, sir? Oh, not just now. I do enjoy 
		a good dog once in a while, sir. You can 
		have yourself a three-course meal from 
		one dog. Start with your canine 
		crudites, go to your Fido flambe for 
		main course and for dessert, a Pekingese 
		parfait. And you can pick your teeth 
		with a little paw."INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAYThe students are all back in their normal seats and Keating leaps
up onto his desk.KEATINGWhy do I stand up here? Anybody?CHARLIETo feel taller.KEATINGNo!
Keating rings the bell on his desk with his footKEATINGThank you for playing, Mr. Dalton. I 
		stand upon my desk to remind yourself 
		that we must constantly look at things 
		in a different way. 

Keating glances around the classroom from atop the desk.KEATINGYou see, the world looks very different 
		from up here. You don't believe me? Come 
		see for yourself. Come on. Come on! 

Charlie and Neil quickly rise from their seats to go to the front
of the classroom. The rest of the class follows them. While Keating
continues speaking, Neil and Charlie join him on the desk and then
Keating jumps down.KEATINGJust when you think you know something, 
		you have to look at it in another way. 
		Even though it may seem silly or wrong, 
		you must try! Now, when you read, don't 
		just consider what the author thinks. 
		Consider what you think.KEATINGBoys, you must strive to find your own 
		voice. Because the longer you wait to 
		begin, the less likely you are to find 
		it at all. Thoreau said, "Most men lead 
		lives of quiet desperation." Don't be 
		resigned to that. Break out!

Keating notices Spaz and another boy leaving the desk immediately.KEATINGDon't just walk off the edge like lemmings.
		Look around you. 

The school bell rings as the boys continue to climb onto the desk.
Keating begins to gather up his stuff. The clock begins to toll as
Keating walks to the back of the class.KEATINGThere! There you go, Mr. Priske. Thank 
		you! Yes! Dare to strike out and find 
		new ground. Now, in addition to your 
		essays, I would like you to compose a 
		poem of your own, an original work.

The students begin to groan. Keating begins flickering the lights
off and on while chanting ominously.KEATINGThat's right! You have to deliver it 
		aloud in front of the class on Monday. 
		Bonne chance, gentlemen. 

Keating steps out into the hall before quickly peeking back in once again.
Todd is the last one to stand on the desk and is about to jump off.KEATINGMr. Anderson? Don't think that I don't 
		know that this assignment scares the 
		hell out of you, you mole.

Keating flicks the light off, leaving Todd to jump down in the darkness
as the students laugh.EXT. RIVER - DAYCameron, Charlie, and several other boys are rowing while Mr. Nolan
shouts orders from a bullhorn.MR. NOLANTake a power train in two! Three! Keep

		Free America!EXT CAMPUS - DAYSeveral students are fencing on a grassy slope.EXT. CAMPUS ROOFTOP - DAYMeeks and Pitts perform a goofy dance together to the music.INT. TODD'S ROOM - DAYTodd is on his bed trying to write a poem. The door opens and Todd
turns his writing pad over. Neil enters the room laughing. He crouches
down next to Todd's bed and plunks a sheet of paper in Todd's lap.NEILI found it.TODDYou found what?NEILWhat I wanna do right now. What's 
		really, really inside me.TODD"A Midsummer Night's Dream"?NEILThis is it.TODDWhat is this?NEILIt's a play, dummy.TODDI know that. I-- Wh-Wh-What does it have 
		to do with you?NEILRight. They're putting it on at Henley 
		Hall. Open tryouts. Open tryouts!TODDYes, so?

Neil pounds on the bed and then pulls a blanket off his bed,
wearing it like a cloak.NEILSo, I'm gonna act. Yes, yes! I'm gonna 
		be an actor! Ever since I can remember, 
		I've wanted to try this. I even tried to 
		go to summer stock auditions last year, 
		but, of course, my father wouldn't let 
		me. For the first time in my whole life 
		I know what I wanna do.

Neil grabs a handful of papers off Todd's bed and tosses them into
the air.NEILand for the first time I'm gonna do it 
		whether my father wants me to or not!
		Carpe diem!TODDNeil, Neil, hold on a minute. How are 
		you gonna be in a play if your father 
		won't let you?NEILFirst I gotta get the part, then I can 
		worry about that.TODDYeah, but won't he kill you if he finds 
		out you went to an audition and didn't 
		even tell him?NEILNo, no, no, no. As far as I'm concerned, 
		he won't have to know about any of this.TODDWell, that's impossible.NEILBullshit! Nothing's impossible.TODDWell, why don't you just call him and 
		ask him? And m-maybe he'll say yes.NEILThat's a laugh!

Neil tosses the blanket back onto his bed.NEILIf I don't ask him, at least I won't
		be disobeying him.TODDYeah, but if he said--NEIL(shouting angrily)
		Jesus, Todd! Whose side are you on?

Todd says nothing. Neil looks at him for a moment and then takes
the flyer back from Todd. He walks over to the window, his 
excitement gone.NEILI mean, I haven't even gotten the part 
		yet. Can't I even enjoy the idea for a 
		little while? 

Once again, Todd says nothing. After a moment, Neil sits on the
heater and Todd returns to his poem.NEILYou're coming to the meeting this 
		afternoon?TODDI don't know. Maybe.NEILNothing Mr. Keating has to say means 
		shit to you, does it, Todd?TODDW-What is that supposed to mean?NEILYou're in the club! Being in the club 
		means being stirred up by things. You 
		look about as stirred up as a cesspool. 

Neil gets up from the window and stands over Todd.TODDSo- You want me out?NEILNo! I want you in, but being in means 
		you gotta do something. Not just say 
		you're in.TODDWell, listen, Neil. I-I appreciate this 
		concern, but I-I'm not like you. All 
		right? You, you, you say thing and 
		people listen. I'm, I'm not like that.NEILDon't you think you could be?TODDNo! I--I, I don't know, but that's not 
		the point. The, the, the point is that 
		there's nothing you can do about it, so 
		you can just butt out. I can take care 
		of myself just fine. All right?NEILNo.TODDWhat do you mean, "no"? 

A smile comes to Neil's face.NEILNo. 

Neil grabs Todd's notebook of poetry and runs across the room with 
it. Todd leaps up after him.TODDGive me-- Neil. Neil, give that back. 

The two begin racing in circles around the room, jumping from
bed to bed as Todd tries to grab his poem back.NEIL"We are dreaming of a--" Poetry! I'm 
		being chased by Walt Whitman! Okay, 
		okay.

Neil drops the notebook. Cameron walks into the room.CAMERONWhat are you guys doing? I'm sure-- You 
		see this chemistry-

Cameron tries to hold up his book and Neil snatches it from his hands and
suddenly all three of them are racing around the room.CAMERONHey, give me-- Neil, give me-- Don't be
		immature. Come on. I need my- 

Charlie enters the room and begins waving his hands.CHARLIEGive it to me! Give it to me!NEILCharlie!

Neil tosses Cameron's book to Charlie.CAMERONLet me have my book, I need my- 

The four boys continue racing around the cramped quarters, tossing
Cameron's book back and forth. Neil picks up a recorder and begins
blowing erratic notes on it while Charlie starts pounding on a set of
bongo drums. Outside the room a crowd of boys watch.EXT. CAMPUS ENTRANCE - DAYKnox is riding his bike around in circles near the entrance. Seeing no
one nearby, he races through the open gates and down the road. He comes
to the top of a hill and then goes downhill across the grass, shouting
as he sends an immense flock of geese flying into the air.EXT. PARKING LOT - DAYA number of vehicles drive up, filled with students dressed in bright red
cosyumes, playing trumpets and various other instruments as they pass.
Knox watches the growing crowd of students. They are all converging on
a bus. A football player, wearing a horned helmet, dances on the roof of
the bus. A band is playing while a group of cheerleaders are practising.
Knox spots Chris amongst the cheerleaders. He watches her until Chet
comes along and she grabs hold of his hand. Knox looks away in disgust.COACHOkay, everybody on the bus. Let's go, 
		boys. Come on, let's go. On the bus, 
		boys. Now!

Chris jumps into Chet's arms as everyone begins to board the buses. Knox
turns his bike around and leaves.EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAYKeating walks across the field, followed by his students. He kicks a ball
ahead of him while he carries a number of other balls in a net slung over
his shoulder.KEATINGNow, devotees may argue that one sport 
		or game is inherently better than 
		another. For me, sport is actually a 
		chance for us to have other human beings 
		push us to excel. I want you all to come 
		over here and take a slip of paper and 
		line up single file.

Keating reaches the stands. He tosses the balls aside and pulls sets
his briefcase down. As the boys line up he begins ripping off slips
of paper from a notepad and handing them out.KEATINGMr. Meeks, time to inherit the earth. 
		Mr. Pitts, rise above your name.

He hands the notepad to another student.KEATINGI want you to hand these out to the boys,
		one apiece.EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAYThe students are all lined up in single file, each holding a slip
of paper. Keating blows his whistle.KEATINGYou know what to do, Pitts.PITTS"Oh to struggle against great odds. To 
		meet enemies undaunted."KEATINGSounds to me like you're daunted. Say it 
		again like you're undaunted.PITTS"Oh to struggle against great odds. To 
		meet enemies undaunted."KEATINGNow go on.

Pitts gives one of the soccer balls a good kick.KEATINGYes! Next.

One of the students sets up the next ball as the line advances.BOY 1"To be a sailor of the world, bound for 
		all ports."KEATINGNext. Louder!BOY 2"Oh, I live to be the ruler of life, not 
		a slave." 

Keating walks away and starts up a record player.BOY 3"To mount the scaffolds. To advance to 
		the muzzle of guns with perfect 
		nonchalance."

Classical music begins playing on the phonograph. Meeks goes to
read next but is confused by the music.KEATINGCome on, Meeks! Listen to the music.MEEKS"To dance, clap hands, exalt, shout, 
		skip, roll on, float on."KEATINGYes!HOPKINS(without energy)
		"Oh, to have life henceforth the poem of 
		new joys." 

Hopkins crumples up his paper and then barely taps the soccer
ball with his foot.

Keating puts a look of disgust on his face.KEATINGOh! Boo! Come on, Charlie, let it fill 
		your soul! 

Charlie raises his hands over his head.CHARLIE"To indeed be a god!"INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAYNeil is racing down the hallway, all excited.NEILCharlie, I got the part! I'm gonna play

Charlie looks up from his desk with a grin.BOY 1Who's Chris?BOY 2Mmm, Chris.KNOXI see a sweetness in her smile. 
		Blight light shines from her eyes. 
		But life is complete; contentment is 
		mine, 
		Just knowing that...

Several students begin to snicker.KNOXjust knowing that she's alive.

Knox crumples his poem and walks back to his desk.KNOXSorry, Captain. It's stupid.KEATINGNo, no. It's not stupid. It's a good 
		effort. It touched on one of the major 
		themes, love. A major theme not only in 
		poetry, but life. Mr. Hopkins, you were 
		laughing. You're up.

Hopkins slowly walks to the front of the class and unfolds
his piece of paper.HOPKINS"The cat sat on the mat."KEATINGCongratulations, Mr. Hopkins. Yours is 
		the first poem to ever have a negative 
		score on the Pritchard scale. We're not 
		laughing at you, we're laughing near 
		you. I don't mind that your poem had a 
		simple theme. Sometimes the most 
		beautiful poetry can be about simple 
		things, like a cat, or a flower or rain. 
		You see, poetry can come from anything 
		with the stuff of revelation in it. Just 
		don't let your poems be ordinary. Now, 
		who's next? 

Keating approaches Todd's desk.KEATINGMr. Anderson, I see you sitting there in 
		agony. Come on, Todd, step up. Let's put 
		you out of your misery.TODDI, I didn't do it. I didn't write a 
		poem.KEATINGMr. Anderson thinks that everything 
		inside of him is worthless and 
		embarrassing. Isn't that right, Todd? 
		Isn't that your worst fear? Well, I 
		think you're wrong. I think you have 
		something inside of you that is worth a 
		great deal.

Keating walks up to the blackboard and begins to write.KEATING"I sound my barbaric yawp over the 
		rooftops of the world." W. W. Uncle Walt 
		again. Now, for those of you who don't 
		know, a yawp is a loud cry or yell. Now, 
		Todd, I would like you to give us a 
		demonstration of a barbaric "yawp." Come 
		on. You can't yawp sitting down. Let's 
		go. Come on. Up.

Todd reluctantly stands and follows Keating to the front.KEATINGYou gotta get in "yawping" stance.TODDA yawp?KEATINGNo, not just a yawp. A barbaric yawp.TODD(quietly)
		Yawp.KEATINGCome on, louder.TODD(quietly)
		Yawp.KEATINGNo, that's a mouse. Come on. Louder.TODDYawp.KEATINGOh, good God, boy. Yell like a man!TODD(shouting)
		Yawp!KEATINGThere it is. You see, you have a 
		barbarian in you, after all.

Todd goes to return to his seat but Keating stops him.KEATINGNow, you don't get away that easy.

Keating turns Todd around and points out a picture on the wall.KEATINGThe picture of Uncle Walt up there. What 
		does he remind you of? Don't think. 
		Answer. Go on.

Keating begins to circle around Todd.TODDA m-m-madman.KEATINGWhat kind of madman? Don't think about 
		it. Just answer again.TODDA c-crazy madman.KEATINGNo, you can do better than that. Free up 
		your mind. Use your imagination. Say the 
		first thing that pops into your head, 
		even if it's total gibberish. Go on, go 
		on.TODDUh, uh, a sweaty-toothed madman.KEATINGGood God, boy, there's a poet in you, 
		after all. There, close your eyes. Close 
		your eyes. Close 'em. Now, describe what 
		you see. 

Keating puts his hands over Todd's eyes and they begin to slowly
spin around.TODDUh, I-I close my eyes.KEATINGYes?TODDUh, and this image floats beside me.KEATINGA sweaty-toothed madman?TODDA sweaty-toothed madman with a stare 
		that pounds my brain.KEATINGOh, that's excellent. Now, give him 
		action. Make him do something.TODDH-His hands reach out and choke me.KEATINGThat's it. Wonderful. Wonderful.

Keating removes his hands from Todd but Todd keeps his eyes
closed.TODDAnd, and all the time he's mumbling.KEATINGWhat's he mumbling?TODDM-Mumbling, "Truth. Truth is like, like 
		a blanket that always leaves your feet 
		cold." 

The students begin to laugh and Todd opens his eyes. Keating
quickly gestures for him to close them again.KEATINGForget them, forget them. Stay with the 
		blanket. Tell me about that blanket.TODDY-Y-Y-You push it, stretch it, it'll 
		never be enough. You kick at it, beat 
		it, it'll never cover any of us. From 
		the moment we enter crying to the moment

Todd opens his eyes. The class is silent. Then they begin to clap
and cheer.KEATING(whispering to Todd)

Neil enters the cave carrying a beat up light stand.NEILFriend, scholar, Welton men.MEEKSWhat is that, Neil?PITTSDuh. It's a lamp, Meeks.

Neil removes the shade from the lamp, revealing the shape of a man
as the base of the lamp.NEILNo. This is the god of the cave.MEEKSThe god of the cave.

Charlie begins making loud noises with his saxophone.PITTSCharlie, what are you doing?CHARLIEWhat do you say we start this meeting?BOY 1Y-Yeah, just-- I need a light. I just

		I've been calm all my life. I'll do 
		something about that.NEILWhere are you going?CHARLIEWhat are you gonna do?KNOXI'm gonna call her.

Knox begins to chuckle as he leaves the cave. The others
quickly grab their coats to follow him. Charlie goes back to
playing noise on his saxophone again.INT. HALLWAY - DAYKnox is making a call from the payphone.CHRIS (O.S.)Hello?

Knox flips his scarf dramatically around his neck as he walks away
and climbs the stairs.EXT. COURTYARD - DAYThe students are standing in a line while Cameron, Pitts, and Knox
are walking in a circle. Keating watches as they go around.KEATINGNo grades at stake, gentlemen. Just take

After a few moments, the three boys begin to march to the same beat.KEATINGThere it is. 

The other boys start clapping to the rhythm of their steps.KEATINGI don't know, but I've been told--BOYSI don't know, but I've been told--KEATINGDoing poetry is old--BOYSDoing poetry is old-- 

Mr. Nolan looks out at them from his office as Keating joins the
boys and begins marching with them.KEATINGLeft, left, left-right-left. Left, left, 
		left-right-left. Left, halt! 

The boys come to a halt.KEATINGThank you, gentlemen. If you noticed, 
		everyone started off with their own 
		stride, their own pace.

Keating begins walking very slowly.KEATINGMr. Pitts, taking his time. He knew he'll
		get there one day. Mr. Cameron, you could
		see him thinking, "Is this right? It might
		be right. It might be right. I know that. 
		Maybe not. I don't know."

Keating begins walking with his groin pushed forward.KEATINGMr. Overstreet, driven by deeper force.
		Yes. We know that. All right. Now, I
		didn't bring them up here to ridicule
		them. I brought them up here to illustrate
		the point of conformity: the difficulty in 
		maintaining your own beliefs in the face 
		of others. Now, those of you -- I see 
		the look in your eyes like, "I would've 
		walked differently." Well, ask 
		yourselves why you were clapping. Now, 
		we all have a great need for acceptance. 
		But you must trust that your beliefs are 
		unique, your own, even though others may 
		think them odd or unpopular, even though 
		the herd may go, "That's baaaaad." Robert 
		Frost said, "Two roads diverged in a 
		wood and I, I took the one less traveled 
		by, and that has made all the 
		difference." Now, I want you to find 
		your own walk right now. Your own way of 
		striding, pacing. Any direction. 
		Anything you want. Whether it's proud, 
		whether it's silly, anything. Gentlemen, 
		the courtyard is yours.

The students begin walking about, some walking casually, others
making up silly walks. Keating notices that Charlie is still
leaning up against one of the pillars.KEATINGYou don't have to perform. Just make it 
		for yourself. Mr. Dalton? You be joining

		as wonderful as this one? I mean, if, if

		it's rather aerodynamic, isn't it? I can

Neil tosses the desk set lightly in the air. Todd stands up
and Neil hands him the desk set.NEILTodd? The world's first unmanned flying 
		desk set.

Todd flings the desk set over the side of the walkway and it

running out from one of the rooms.CHRISKnox!KNOXHi.CHRISYou made it. Great! Bring anybody?KNOXNo. 

Chris grabs Knox by his jackets and pulls him forward as she walks
toward the stairs.CHRISNo. Ginny Danburry's here. Wait. I have

The two guys raise their glasses in a toast and Knox reluctantly
joins them.KNOXTo Mutt.

passes Chet and several of his friends. He steps over several couples
kissing on the floor and slump down on the couch, only to be crowded
in by another couple who seem oblivious to him. He is about to get up
again when he notices Chris sleeping next to him on the couch.KNOXGod help me.

Knox looks about and then looks back down at Chris.KNOXCarpe diem.

Knox takes a last swig of his drink  and then begins to softly run his
fingers over Chris' hair. He then leans over and kisses her forehead.
Across the room, Bubba looks over and sees what's going on.BUBBAChet! Chet! Look!CHETWhat?BUBBAIt's Mutt Sanders' brother.CHETHuh? 

Chris rises up from the couch and looks at Knox in surprise.CHRISKnox, what--BUBBAAnd he's feeling up your girl!CHRISWhat are you doing?

tries to protect himself.CHRISChet, no! You'll hurt him! No! No! Stop

Chris manages to haul Chet away from Knox.CHETBastard!

Mr. Nolan. Several are carrying newspapers in their hands. The
students all rise as they enter. After all the professors have
taken their places, Mr. Nolan addresses the students.MR. NOLANSit.

The students all sit.MR. NOLANIn this week of Welton's Honor there

their heads in disbelief.INT. NOLAN'S OFFICE - DAYCharlie stands with his back to the door as Mr. Nolan shuts it. Mr. 
Nolan then walks around to face Charlie.MR. NOLANWipe that smirk off your face. If you

Charlie sighs and bends over, resting his hands on the desk. Mr.
Nolan hefts a flat wooden paddle in his hands.MR. NOLANCount aloud, Mr. Dalton.

Neil nods in agreement.ACTORWhat did you think?WOMANReally I thought you were all just

		Poets Society?

Todd says nothing.MR. ANDERSONAnswer him, Todd.TODDYes, sir.

Mr. Nolan puts his glasses on and glances at a paper before him
before removing his glasses once more.MR. NOLANI have here a detailed description of 
		what occurred at your meetings. It 
		describes how your teacher, Mr. Keating, 
		encouraged you boys to organize this 
		club and to use it as a source of 
		inspiration for reckless and self-
		indulgent behavior. It describes how Mr. 
		Keating, both in and out of the 
		classroom, encouraged Neil Perry to 
		follow his obsession with acting when he 
		knew all along it was against the 
		explicit order of Neil's parents. It was 
		Mr. Keating's blatant abuse of his 
		position as teacher that led directly to 
		Neil Perry's death. 

Mr. Nolan motions to Todd's father, who passes along a sheet of
paper to Todd.MR. NOLANRead that document carefully, Todd. Very 
		carefully.

Todd looks at the paper, which already contains the signatures of
the other four boys.MR. NOLANIf you've nothing to add or amend, sign 
		it.TODDWhat's gonna happen to Mr. Keating?MR. ANDERSONI've had enough. Sign the paper, Todd.

up at Keating, giving him a brief wave. Keating waves back.INT. KEATING'S OFFICE - DAYKeating laughs slightly as he watches McAllister from the window.
Inside, all his belongings have been packed up.INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAYThe students are all seated at their desks in silence. Everyone looks
as the door opens. They quickly stand as Mr. Nolan enters the room.MR. NOLANSit.

The students sit once again as Mr. Nolan walks to the front of the room.MR. NOLANI'll be teaching this class through 
		exams. We'll find a permanent English 
		teacher during the break. Who will tell 
		me where you are in the Pritchard 
		textbook?MR. NOLANMr. Anderson?TODDUh, in the, in the Pr-MR. NOLANI can't hear you, Mr. Anderson.TODDIn the, in the, in the Pritchard?MR. NOLANKindly inform me, Mr. Cameron.CAMERONWe skipped around a lot, sir. We covered

		on Post Civil War literature.MR. NOLANWhat about the Realists?CAMERONI believe we skipped most of that, sir.MR. NOLANAll right, then, we'll start over. What 
		is poetry?

There is a knock at the classroom door.MR. NOLANCome.

away when hey see it is Keating.KEATINGExcuse me. I came for my personals. 
		Should I come back after class?MR. NOLANGet them now, Mr. Keating.MR. NOLANGentlemen, turn to page 21 of the 
		introduction. Mr. Cameron, read aloud 
		the excellent essay by Dr. Pritchard on

room off the classroom.CAMERONThat page has been ripped out, sir.MR. NOLANWell, borrow somebody else's book.CAMERONThey're all ripped out, sir.MR. NOLANWhat do you mean, they're all ripped 
		out?CAMERONSir, we, uh-MR. NOLANNever mind.

Mr. Nolan takes his own book over to Cameron's desk and then
slaps the open page.MR. NOLANRead!

As Cameron begins to read, Keating looks out at Todd as he puts
his scarf on. Todd looks at him for a moment and then glances away.CAMERON"Understanding Poetry by Dr. J Evans 
		Pritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand 
		poetry, we must first be fluent with its 
		meter, rhyme and figures of speech, then 
		ask two questions: 1) How artfully has 
		the objective of the poem been rendered 
		and 2)..."

The door squeaks as Keating shuts it behind him. Cameron pauses.CAMERON"... How important is that objective? 
		Question 1 rates the poem's perfection; 
		question 2 rates its importance. And 
		once these questions have been answered, 
		determining the poem's greatness becomes 
		a relatively simple matter. If the 
		poem's score for perfection is plotted 
		on the horizontal of a graph--"

Keating passes by Todd and the others and gets to the back of the
classroom before Todd leaps up from his seat and turns to face him.TODDMr. Keating! They made everybody sign 
		it. 

Mr. Nolan gets up from his desk and approaches Todd.MR. NOLANQuiet, Mr. Anderson.TODDYou gotta believe me. It's true.KEATINGI do believe you, Todd.MR. NOLANLeave, Mr. Keating.TODDBut it wasn't his fault!MR. NOLANSit down, Mr. Anderson!

Todd reluctantly returns to his seat.MR. NOLANOne more outburst from you or anyone
		else, and you're out of this school!
		Leave, Mr. Keating.

Keating hesitates at the back of the classroom.MR. NOLANI said leave, Mr. Keating.

Keating slowly turns and heads to the door. As he opens
it, Todd, stands upon his desk and turns to Keating.TODDO Captain! My Captain!MR. NOLANSit down, Mr. Anderson!

Keating pauses at the door and looks back at Todd on his desk.MR. NOLANDo you hear me? Sit down! Sit down! This 
		is your final warning, Anderson. How 
		dare you? Do you hear me?

After a moment of indecision, Knox climbs up onto his desk.KNOXO Captain! My Captain!MR. NOLANMr. Overstreet, I warn you! Sit down!

Pitts climbs up onto his desk, followed by several others,
including Meeks.MR. NOLANSit down! Sit down. All of you. I want

		Keating.

More students stand on their desks until half the class is standing.MR. NOLANAll of you, down. I want you seated. Do 
		you hear me?MR. NOLANSit down! 

Keating stands in the doorway, staring up at the boys in wonder. A
smile comes to his face.KEATINGThank you, boys. Thank you.
