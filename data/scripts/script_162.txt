Beavis and Butt-Head Do America - by Mike Judge and Joe Stillman"BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO AMERICA"byMike Judge and Joe StillmanThe movie begins with scenes of people screaming in horror 
	and running down the streets of a big city. The ground shakes from 
	what seems like giant footsteps. There are pieces of building 
	debris falling everywhere, people getting crushed, power lines 
	coming down, etc. - complete pandemonium. It all looks very much 
	like a Japanese animated King-Kong or Godzilla movie. We hear the 
	footsteps getting closer and the ground shaking becomes more 
	intense - more debris falling. Then we see a HUGE BLACK TENNIS 
	SHOE come into frame and smash a National Guard truck. As we pan 
	up, we see the white socks, then the red shorts, the AC/DC T-
	shirt, then we hear the familiar, "Huh huh huh." - only it's a 
	huge sound...this is a THREE-HUNDRED FOOT TALL BUTT-HEAD. "Butt-
	Kong" continues his path of destruction - stomping on cars and 
	buildings and saying, "This is cool. Huh huh huh."
		Airplanes and tanks start firing at Butt-Head (Butt-Kong). 
	He looks irritated and says, "Cut it out butt-munch!" Butt-Head 
	swats at the planes, sending them crashing to the ground and 
	stomps on the tanks. Then, something catches his eye. Butt-Head 
	reaches into a skyscraper and picks up a nice looking woman - a 
	lot like the one from the King Kong movie. He looks down at her in 
	his hand and goes wide-eyed, "Whoa! Huh huh huh." The woman 
	screams in terror as Butt-Head looks down at her and tries a few 
	lame pick up lines. "Uuuuh...Hey baby. I'm like, pretty tall. Huh 
	huh huh." He swats down a helicopter that is circling his head, 
	"Dammit, I'm trying to score!" The helicopter goes down in flames. 
	We CUT TO some guys sitting on a tank firing at him. They notice 
	giant footsteps coming from the other direction and turn the tank 
	around. Through their binoculars we see a THREE-HUNDRED FOOT 
	BEAVIS coming from the horizon. The giant Beavis is even more 
	destructive than Butt-Kong (maybe he could be breathing fire). 
	Beavis starts trying to pick up on Butt-Head's woman. Butt-Head 
	puts the woman down and he and Beavis begin to go at it, leveling 
	the city with one of their stupid juvenile smack-fights.

	Butt-Kong to Butt-Head asleep on the couch with Beavis shaking

	DOOR, then back at the EMPTY SPACE where the TV was. He does this 
	a couple of times - piecing it all together.BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)Whoa! I think I just figured something
