    Fresh snow glistens in the sunlight and reflects off of the
    giant pine trees covering the serene mountain side.

    It's quiet.

    So quiet.HARD CUT TO:FROZENHARD CUT TO:2   EXT. THE CHAIR LIFT - DAY                                     2Tight on a gloved hand as a lever is released.

    Tight on the cables at the top of a rickety chair lift as
    they kick into motion.

    Wider as an empty chair swivels around and beneath the asses
    of a threesome of SKIERS.

    Even wider to reveal a long line of Skiers and SNOWBOARDERS
    awaiting their moment to step up to the chair.



    The camera finds a group of three standing off to the side of
    the line, decked out in their winter gear.3   EXT. SNOW BANK OVERLOOKING THE CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS        3Angle on DAN WALKER (college age, shaggy hair, holding a
    snowboard and a helmet in one hand) as he studies the
    situation. Next to him stands an impatient JOE LYNCH
    (college age, goggles on his head and a face full of fresh
    stubble, standing on skis).LYNCHI don't see her.DANThe shift change is late.   Just
                wait.

    PARKER O'NEIL (college age, red hair, holding a snowboard)
    sighs and stares back at the lift lane.2.PARKERAre you sure about this?DANWe've been doing this forever.
          Trust me. This lady loves Lynch.
          She always goes for it.



Lynch smiles at Parker.LYNCHI'm cute.


Just then, JASON (a ski mountain employee) approaches the
front of the line and excuses the employee working the chair.PARKERIs um... is that her?DANShit.LYNCHDude.DANIt's cool, it's cool.
              (to Parker)
          Look, all you have to do is smile
          real pretty and tell him-PARKER-What?   Me? No way.    This is your
          thing.DANParker, listen, listen. It's so
          easy. All you do is tell the guy
          that you and your friends-LYNCH-GIRLfriends. Say "girlfriends".DAN-you and your girlfriends forgot
          your credit card and you can't pick
          up your lift tickets.


He grabs a wad of cash out of Lynch's glove and shoves it in
Parker's hand.3.DAN (cont'd)
              Start at $50. That's what we
              usually give the other lady. He'll
              take it. Trust me.PARKERDan, no.   You do it.    I feel
              stupid.DANYou've got this.    You can totally
              do this.LYNCHParker, you've so got this.DANThe worst thing that happens is he
              says no. He won't say no. No one
              ever says no.PARKERWhy me?LYNCH`Cause you're a girl.DANA very beautiful girl with a very
              charming smile.
                  (then)

              Just...

    He unzips her jacket a little bit, showing some more of her
    body.


                         DAN (cont'd)
              There.PARKERMy charming smile?

    Dan and Lynch smile back at her.    She exits reluctantly
    towards the lift line.4   EXT. CHAIR LIFT LINE - CONTINUOUS                                4Parker pushes her snowboard forward and moves up the side of
    the line, passing all of the skiers who are waiting.

    She approaches Jason who is now running the lift.    He lights
    a cigarette.4.PARKERHey.

Jason looks up at her.

                    PARKER (cont'd)
          Could I bum a smoke?



She flashes an adorable but forced smile and he quickly
obliges with a cigarette.

                      PARKER (cont'd)
          Thanks.

He lights her cigarette.

                    PARKER (cont'd)
          I'm Parker.

He looks around, not all that sure why a cute girl is talking
to him for more than just to get a smoke.JASONJason.PARKEROh, cool.    My brother's name is
          Jason.JASONOK.PARKERYeah, so I don't want to waste your
          time and bullshit you cause you
          seem like a wicked busy guy and
          everything...but..this is gonna
          sound so stupid...

Jason is all ears.

                    PARKER (cont'd)
          My girlfriends and I drove all the
          way up here from Salem State, and I
          was sort of the dumbass who told
          everyone that I could cover the
          lift tickets on my Mom's credit
          card...but then I left her credit
          card at the gas station...and so...

Jason totally sees where this is going.5.JASONRight.PARKERNo- but I mean, we totally have
              some cash and stuff. We just don't
              have enough to cover all 3 lift
              tickets, you know?

    Jason exhales two lungs full of smoke as the next group gets
    onto the lift.JASONHow much?PARKERLike...fifty?

    Jason scoffs and starts the lift.JASONI could lose my job.

    He looks around.5   EXT. SNOW BANK OVERLOOKING THE CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS        5Lynch and Dan watch Parker at work.LYNCHHe's not going for it.DANWill you shut up? He's gonna go
              for it. It's either stand there
              and do the job for minimal...
              minimal, what is it?LYNCHMinimum.DAN-Minimum wage or do it for minimum
              wage plus a little bit more.

    Lynch sighs, then changes the subject.LYNCHShe had to come skiing with us?

    Dan looks back at him, offended.6.DANYou said you didn't mind?LYNCHI don't.   I don't mind.   Don't mind
          at all.XA beat.

                    LYNCH (cont'd)
          I'm just saying, you haven't done
          dollar pitchers at Fezziwigs withRus since last semester. You never
          come around for Monday night
          football, nobody has seen you at-DANA-I watched the game with you last
          week!LYNCHFor ten minutes, Dan. Football
          games are more than ten minutes.MThey're lots of ten minutes-es, you
          know?DANDude, I have a girlfriend now. I
          love this girl. I don't know what
          you...DLYNCHNo, no it's fine. I'm just saying,
          the Mount Holliston day trips were
          our thing, you know? She doesn't
          even know how to board yet.EDANShe's getting better.
              (then)
          Now I feel like a dick. You should
          have said something if it was a
          problem.LYNCHIt's not a problem. It's not.
          Forget I ever said anything.

They see Parker hand Jason something. He pockets it and she
glides her way back to the end of the line.

She looks up at the guys waiting on the hill and then
excitedly waves. Proud of herself.7.Dan smiles at Lynch.6   EXT. CHAIR LIFT LINE - CONTINUOUS                             6Lynch and Dan join Parker and slowly work their way up the
    line.XDANGood work!     See?   They always go
              for it.RPARKERI did good, right?LYNCHYou did great.ADANOh, so where's my change?PARKERThere isn't any.MDANYou gave him the full hundred?PARKERHe wasn't going for it at 50.DANDSo what happened to the other fifty
              numbers in between there? Like, I
              don't know, $51 or maybe even $75?PARKEREYou gave me two 50's. What was I
              supposed to do, ask for change?LYNCHI would have asked for change.PARKERIt's still way cheaper than paying
              for tickets, right?

    Dan is disappointed.LYNCHI would have definitely asked him
              for change.8.They get up to the front of the line.    Jason looks at Dan and
    Lynch behind Parker.JASON(scoffs at Parker)
              "Girlfriends"?XParker gives him an apologetic smile.

    The three get in front of the chair. It descends under them
    and scoops them off of the ground into the air.R7   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - MOMENTS LATER                                 7The threesome float high above the mountain as the chair
    slowly makes it's way to the top.ADANLook at that. See? All these
              other idiots are paying top dollar
              to ski. Not us. All thanks to
              you, baby.MPARKER(teasing)
              Oh, now I'm "baby"?     You never call
              me pet names.DANI'm just not a `pet name' guy.DPARKER(to Lynch)
              He calls me "Parker."EDANIt's your name.PARKERYeah but you're supposed to call me
              something affectionate, you know?
              Like "honey" or "sweetie".LYNCHI hooked up with a girl last
              semester that called me by my last
              name in bed. It was so weird.
              "Oh, Lynch! Your hair is so soft!
              Do me harder, Lynch!" It was like
              I was throwing it to Dan over here.

    Dan looks back to Parker.9.DANSee? At least I don't call you
          "O'Neil".PARKERYou don't touch my face enough
          either.XDan laughs.LYNCH(to no one imparticular)RThird wheel.

Parker reaches across and playfully taps Lynch.PARKERAWatch it, Lynch.LYNCHHey, that's not fair. I'm not
          dating you, you don't get to make
          my life suck.MParker shoots Dan a look: "Oh, really?"DANWha-? I never said that. I never
          said you make my life suck.
              (then, forced)
          Sweetie.DAfter a beat he awkwardly reaches out and touches her face.
Nothing sweet or sensitive about it, but he's trying.PARKERE(sarcastically)
          Aww!LYNCH(to Parker)
          Dan tells me you're getting the
          hang of that board?PARKERI wouldn't say that. But last time
          we went I did pretty good, right?DANYou did awesome. I'm telling you,
          the first few times are frustrating
          but once you get the hang of it,
          it's like riding a bike.(MORE)10.DAN(cont'd)
              (to Lynch's skis)
          Are you gonna trade in those
          ancient things for a board?LYNCHPlease. Snowboards are too EMO for
          me. Give it ten more years and
          that fad will be dead.XDANThat's what they said about rap.

Parker removes a cigarette and lights it.RLYNCHMmm-mmm. Smell that fresh mountain
          air, huh? Kind of smells like...
          cancer.APARKERYou know what, I am so sick of
          potheads giving me shit about
          smoking butts.MLYNCHAt least pot does something for
          you. Cigarettes are just gross.
          Especially out in the cold. It
          like sticks to you and then you
          smell like a mixture of ash tray
          and an old man's used floss.DDANUsed floss? Where do you come up
          with this shit.LYNCHEHave you ever sniffed your floss?
          It's nasty.

Dan and Lynch both crack up at this, huge.DANNo, I have never- why would I ever
          sniff my floss? Why am I friends
          with you?

Parker blows more smoke out.

                    DAN (cont'd)
          Gimme a drag.

He takes her cigarette from her.11.PARKERWhat time do you think we'll get
          back? I have about 2 weeks worth
          of chapters to read tonight.LYNCHOh no. She broke the rule.X(to Parker)
          Parker you just broke the first
          rule.PARKERRWhat?DANNo worrying about the bullshit of
          real life. The whole point of thisAis to relax and have fun. Worry
          about school when you get home.PARKERBut, I haven't read a-MThe chair suddenly stops and lurches forward slightly.   The
sound of the chair lift cuts out.

A deep silence takes over quickly, like the type of silence
that used to suddenly happen in school when you were taking a
test and the radiator that you never even noticed was on
would suddenly shut off.DRandom SKIERS and BOARDERS in the surrounding chairs express
their disgust for the delay.

Parker instinctively grabs Dan's hand.EDANIt's alright.LYNCHUh-oh! Is someone afraid of
          heights?PARKERNo.LYNCHSo it doesn't bother you when I do
          this?

Lynch rocks the chair back and forth.

Parker grabs hold of the safety bar.12.PARKERQuit it!

Dan motions to Lynch to stop.

                    PARKER (cont'd)
          I'm not afraid of heights.   I justXdon't like them.DANBaby, in the whole history of time,
          only one chair has ever fallen offRof a lift.PARKERPoints for calling me "baby" but
          you just made that statistic up.ALYNCHYeah, statistics don't work on
          smokers.PARKERM(nervous laughter)
          Oh, shut-up.

Lynch turns around and yells behind him.LYNCHOK, WHAT ASSHOLE COULDN'T GET ONTHE CHAIR RIGHT?DLaughter echoes from the chairs behind him.

He yells forward.ELYNCH (cont'd)COME ON, I PAID GOOD MONEY TO DOSOME SKIING!DANActually, I paid good money.LYNCHYeah, but I'm gonna pay you back so
          it's like the same thing.

With a lurch, the chair starts moving forward again and the
whirring sound of the cables above them start up again.

Applause is heard from all of the other chairs.13.LYNCH (cont'd)THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!WOO!Dan lets go of Parker's hand and gives her a smile.   She
    smiles back.XHe playfully sticks his tongue out at her and she laughs as
    their chair moves forward exiting frame.8   EXT. TOP OF THE CHAIR LIFT - LATER                                8RThe three begin to get situated with their boards and skis.PARKERWhy do I have to wear a helmet?ADANSafety first.PARKERBut you guys don't wear them.MShe looks around.

                        PARKER (cont'd)
              I only see little kids wearing
              them.DANDCause they're still learning, too.
              Come on, I'm not gonna argue about
              this.LYNCHEEven extreme boarders wear helmets.
              Nobody makes fun of them.

    She begrudgingly puts on her helmet.   She's not happy about
    it.

    Dan and Lynch smile.DAN / LYNCHAwww.PARKERYou're just doing this to make fun
              of me.

    Dan's laughing.14.DANNo, I'm not. I swear.    You look
          hot in a helmet.

Off to the side, Lynch spots SHANNON (cute, brunette, 20's)
struggling with her boot strap. She falls down on her ass.XLynch nonchalantly maneuvers over to her side.LYNCHNeed some help?RSHANNON(laughing)
          Do you think?

Lynch puts out a hand to help her and pulls her up almostAdirectly into his face.

Parker and Dan watch from afar as Lynch helps her with her
boot strap.

He has one hand innocently on the back of her knee and he isMfastening the strap with his other.PARKERAww, check out Lynch.

From their point of view, they watch Lynch helping the girl.DANDSee?   Chick magnet.

Almost as if on cue, RYAN (an enormous dude, 20's) stomps
over and shoves Lynch down into the snow.ERYANWhat the hell?

Lynch tries to get up.LYNCHWoah! Shit, man!    I was just
          trying to help!

Instantly, Dan moves over to Lynch's aid. Parker follows
slowly behind him. She's clearly not too good on her board.SHANNONRyan, what the hell?RYANHe had his hands all over you!15.SHANNONNo he didn't. I can take care of
          myself!

She shoves him back. Ryan just shakes his head at her and
shoves off, away from the group. He waits for her down the
hill a few feet.XDan and Shannon help Lynch to his feet.

                    SHANNON (cont'd)
          I am so sorry about that. He canRbe such an asshole sometimes.LYNCHI was seriously just trying to
          help. I mean, how could I evenAcompete with a catch like that?

He waves to Ryan.   Ryan just looks away.SHANNON(laughs)MAre you OK?LYNCHYeah, I'm fine.SHANNONWell, thank you for your help.    I
          am so, so sorry about that.D(then)
          I'm Shannon, by the way.LYNCHJoe.ERYAN(calling to her)
          Shan!

Shannon rolls her eyes.SHANNONWell it was nice to meet you.

She takes off after Ryan.LYNCH(to his friends)
          I was like one second away from
          beating that guy's ass.16.DANI know you were, man.   Come on.
              Don't sweat it.LYNCHSeriously, that guy was such a
              dick.XPARKERCome on boys. We can talk about
              how tough you both are at the
              bottom.RLynch starts down the hill.DANI'm tough.APARKERI know you are.

    They push off out of frame.M9   EXT. SKI TRAIL - LATER                                          9Dan, Parker, and Lynch move down the mountain on their snow
    boards and skis.

    Quick cuts of Dan helping Parker learn.    Lynch impatiently
    waits.DFinally, Parker comes to a stop on her own next to Dan and he
    claps for her.DANELook at you! See?   Having fun?PARKERAre you kidding? We are totally
              doing this every weekend. In fact,
              if they were open during the week
              I'd say we should cut class, too.

    Lynch suddenly flies over the hill and sprays both of them
    down with powder.LYNCHLast one to the bottom is buying
              dinner!

    He eats it mere seconds later and lands on his ass.17.Parker and Dan take off laughing while Lynch feebly tries to
     get back on his feet.10   INT. SKI LODGE - EARLY EVENING                            10Parker gets herself some hot chocolate in the distance whileXDan and Lynch pick at what's left of a pizza on the table in
     front of them.DANWe gotta take a weekend trip upRNorth one of these days. Hit up
               Killington or Okemo and really do
               it up right.LYNCHAWhy don't we just do it over
               Christmas. You and me.DANDone. When I stayed with my cousin
               out West two years ago it was likeMthe stuff you see in commercials.
               We had to take like 3 lifts to get
               to the top and it was powder as far
               as you could see.LYNCHWell, speaking of good skiing...
               it's been cool doing the bunny hillDall day but do you think we could
               get one real run in before we leave
               tonight?

     Dan feels bad.EDANDude, you didn't have to stay with
               us. It's totally cool if you want
               to go off for a few.

     Parker is now walking back to their table behind Lynch and is
     pretty much right on top of them.LYNCHNo, it's fine. I'm just saying
               let's step it up a notch at some
               point. It's been cool watching
               Parker fall on her ass all day but
               I would like to actually ski at
               some point.18.Parker feels horrible.PARKERYou know, I've probably had enough
          for today anyway. I can just stay
          in the lodge if you guys want to go-XNow Lynch feels horrible.LYNCH-no, no, no that's not what I
          meant. I didn't mean it like that.RParker looks to Dan.PARKERI told you I didn't have to come.ALYNCHParker, I didn't not want you to
          come.

Dan tries to help.MDANIt was his idea that we invited you
          in the first place.LYNCHExactly. Remember? I was like
          "Hey man, why doesn't Parker comeDwith us?" And you were like-DAN-I was like, "OK that would be
          cool".EParker isn't buying it.   She puts on a smile.PARKERIt's OK, you guys. The last thing
          a girl wants to do is intrude on
          "guy time". I won't be offended.
          I've got stuff I could do anyway.

     Lynch and Parker are still. Their bodies are huddledMtogether, but neither is moving.

     In fact, at a first glance, one might think they are both
     human popcycles.

     The dark splotches of frost-bite on Parker's nose and cheeks
     have now grown to what almost looks like patches of black
     fungus on her skin.DLynch has the start of his own frost-bite on his ears and
     nose.

     Slowly, Parker's eyes flutter and she awakens.EHer eyes search around as the realization that this was not
     all just a bad dream sinks in.

     She adjusts in her seat and feels something pull. She winces
     and looks down. Slowly the camera follows her stare down to
     reveal her bare hand, gripping the icy safety bar.

     She pulls...but her skin is stuck to the frozen metal.

     Beginning to panic, she jerks her hand hard, taking the bar
     up about half an inch with it.PARKERUhh...76.Painstakingly slow, she begins to peel her hand off of the
bar.

A sound that resembles `jeans slowly tearing' can be softly
heard as she moves her arm forward and separates her hand
from the skin that is attached to the metal.XAfter what feels like an eternity, she gives her hand one
last jerk, freeing it from the safety bar.

                    PARKER (cont'd)
          Ruuugh!RHer movement startles Lynch awake, and he bolts upright as if
from a `falling nightmare'.

Discombobulated, Lynch turns back and forth franticallyAtrying to get his bearings.

Parker is crying and holding her bloody hand,

                    PARKER (cont'd)
          Shhhh.MLynch, bug-eyed, takes in the world around him.

A fresh coat of snow has covered everything in several inches
of peaceful white bliss.

Below them, the snow has completely covered Dan's remains.
There is nothing left to show that there was ever even aDstruggle.

Parker hides her bloody hand back inside of her coat, away
from Lynch's eyes.ELYNCHI...thought I was dreaming.   This.
          I thought this was a dream.

He turns to look at Parker. It takes everything he has to
not jolt back in horror at how bad her face looks.PARKERWhat?LYNCHYour frost-bite.   It's
          getting...worse.

She starts to touch her face.77.PARKERReally?    How bad is it?

see the other chairs.

Lynch doesn't respond. The look on his face says that "noDone is coming" but he decides there's no harm in waiting just
a little while longer.

Lynch tries to yell for help again, though his soar throat is
making it almost impossible to scream.ELYNCHUP HERE!   SOMEONE HELP US!Once again...only echoes.

     Parker is ancy.    She looks all around.   Thinking.

     Finally she squeezes her eyes shut...embarrassed.

     Her snow pants turn dark around her bottom. Slowly a puddle
     of urine forms on the chair between her and Lynch.

     Below them, the urine falls into the snow and disappears.

     Parker's eyes swell as she begins to cry what's left of her
     tears. She is emotionally degraded and devastated.80.As her nose begins to run, she instinctively wipes her hand
     across it...taking a small piece of the dead flesh off of her

distance between his dangling body and the frozen ground.

Tight on his gloved hands as they slowly slide forward on the
metal cable.DLynch squeezes his eyes shut and takes another reach forward.

breath and whispering...EPARKER(whispered)
          Please God...please God....please
          God...

The metal arm above her groans under the pressure that the
one remaining bolt is under. Looking at the arm in this
state, it is especially eerie to imagine how these metal
chairs even stay attached to the cables in the first place.

Lynch takes another move forward.LYNCHRrrugh!89.PARKERYou can do it. Please do it.

cable. He momentarily hangs by one arm.LYNCHXArrrrr!PARKERJOE!RHe reaches up and grabs hold again...his strength is weaning.LYNCH(through gritted teeth)
          Got it.AAnother few quick reaches forward and he is more than halfway
across to the next chair.

From Lynch's point of view we can see his feet floating above
the earth and hear the sound of his own heart beat. His ownMpained breathing fills his ears.

It's only now that he sees two of the wolves watching him
from the bushes.

back into the bushes.

Her movement makes the chair groan harder. The cable twangs
loudly between Lynch's shaky movements and the twisted metal
that holds the arm in place.PARKERThe chair is gonna fall!LYNCHNo.    No it's not.

Slowly he makes his way the remaining distance and positions
himself over the other chair.90.He drops down onto it, sending shards of ice cascading down
into the snow below.

He quickly sits down, breathing heavy and clutching the sides
of the chair.

Parker nods.

She takes Lynch's ski pole and tries to throw it as far as
she can back at him.

The action forces another terrifying metallic groan from the
arm above her, and her chair swings back and forth from the
motion.PARKEROh shit.91.The pole lands under the second chair, splitting the distance
between where she is and where the tree is.

He pulls himself up, straining hard.MLYNCH (cont'd)
          Rrrrugh!

This gets the wolves attention.

In the bushes their ears and eyes perk up to the sky,
watching their potential next meal grapple with the high wire
cable.DWith reserved strength, Lynch shimmies across the cable as
quickly as he can.

Back at Parker's chair, she eyes the bending metal bolt thatEis keeping her from plunging to the ground.

Tears stream down her face again.PARKER(whispered)
          Please god, don't let me fall.
          Don't let me fall.

He stops once to catch his breath, but begins moving as
quickly as possible.

Finally, he reaches the second chair behind them and drops
down into it.

Looking at the lift pole from this position, he can clearly
see that it wasn't as close to the chair as it looked.92.But it's possible.LYNCHShit.

Parker needs to yell to hear him now.XPARKERWHAT?LYNCHNOTHING.RHe assesses the situation.

It's going to take a big leap to try and get near the ladder
and he is winded beyond belief.APARKERWHAT'S WRONG?LYNCHNOTHING.    I'M GONNA GO FOR IT, OK?MPARKER...LYNCH(to himself)OK.DThe two stare at each other from the distance.   Both of their
weather beaten faces are a mess.

Parker is buried in the corner of the chair closest to the
ground, holding on to the back of it to keep herself steady.EStoically, Lynch turns away from her and takes a deep breath.

He climbs up onto the chair back and looks down.

Parker closes her eyes and prays.

The wolves below do not break their stare.   Their hungry eyes
are willing Lynch to fall from the chair.

It's now or never.

He throws himself off of the chair and towards the ladder!93.He lands and hooks his arm around a rung. With a SNAP his
     arm dislocates from it's socket, but he is hooked on to the
     ladder!

     into the snow.LYNCHAOooof!

     The wolves' ears are at attention.     They watch carefully from
     the safety of the bushes.

     towards Lynch...it is revealed that he is only winded.

     He feels his body for damage, wincing at what can only be a
     broken rib or two. His right arm is twisted at an odd angle
     and by the look on Lynch's face, it must be either broken or
     fractured in addition to being dislocated.LYNCHPARKER.PARKER (O.C.)ARE YOU OK?94.The wolf surveys the situation and stops in his tracks.

     Lynch makes it to the ski pole just in time and brandishes it

     chair, swinging his weapon like a madman all the while.

     sticking up in the snow.

     Parker opens her eyes. She must have drifted off for the
     night. She looks to the tree-line around her.AThe sun is coming up.

     She tries to move her body to look back in Lynch's direction
     and the chair argues back at her with another loud groan and
     cable noise.MPARKER(to herself)

     Slowly, Parker turns her body around towards the seat of the
     chair.

     Holding on to the metal beams that make up the chair, she
     beings to lower herself, inch by inch, off of the side.

     CREEEEE-EEK! The lone metal bolt protests the movement and
     makes metallic threats to snap.

     Parker keeps lowering herself until her entire lower body is
     dangling below the chair.

     RRRRRUUUUUURRR! A gust of wind pushes against the chair,
     straining the arm.98.Parker concentrates and slowly tries to hold up her weight as
she inches her body even lower.

Smoothly, slowly, almost there- SNAP!   The bolt gives way!

The chair lurches down at an even greater angle, sending
Parker off of the side!XPARKER (cont'd)AHHHH!WHIRRR! WAP! No longer attached with the safety bolts, theRchair falls several feet and then stops. It is now hanging
only by the one weak thread of cabling that was used to
initially wire it to the main line.

While it is still a long drop...her feet are now a good 10
feet closer to the ground, if not more.

CREEEEEK! The metal wire will not hold for more than a fewMseconds. The chair is going to fall!

Parker closes her eyes.

All sound cuts out except for her quick breathing and her
heartbeat.

The camera shows us how much the last flimsy wire does notDlike this movement as it stretches and the chair sways in the
wind.

Slowly she looks down and prepares herself to fall.EThe camera inches closer in to her face from below.

Her heartbeat and breathing are all we hear until finally...

She let's go.

As her body falls from the chair, the flimsy wire finally
gives way and the rickety metal seat plummets straight down
to the ground after her.CUT TO:99.87   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                             87THUD! Parker lands hard and sound instantly returns to her.

     From Parker's POV, the camera slowly reveals what is just
     beyond the bloody tree...

     But the look on Parker's face tells us everything we need to
     know first.

     There, in the brush on the side of the trail beyond the tree,
     is the pack of wolves.

     Some still feeding.   Others resting attentively.

     They are circled around Lynch's bloody, half-eaten remains.100.Quick shots of his jacket, his boots, and his gloved hand all
     flash before Parker's devastated eyes.

     She slows herself to a complete stop now.   Not knowing what
     to do.

     One of the feeding wolves hears this and looks back to see


     Parker just a few feet away. It is the pack leader.

     Lynch's blood pools from it's jaws.

     It's ears go back and it growls loudly at Parker.RShe makes eye contact with the beast, who stares back at her,
     almost daring her to try and take it's treasure.

     Others from the pack look up, distracted briefly, but then go
     back to feeding.

     Parker and the pack leader lock eyes.

     Finally, the leader turns away from Parker, back to his food.

     Back to his family.

     with tears as she continues on her way down the mountain
