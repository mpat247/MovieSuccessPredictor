                         was getting more and more... unhappy, 
                         more and more frustrated. I needed 
                         to talk to somebody. I needed to 
                         find out if it was me, if I was going 
                         crazy or what. But every time I turned

                         handle it. He became very... I don't 
                         know, very threatened. I mean, 
                         whenever I would bring up anything 
                         he would act like it was some kind

                         wasn't a terrible person. And that 
                         just because I needed some creative 
                         and emotional outlet other than my 
                         child, that didn't make me unfit to
