                               Dee ReesSUPER:"WHEREVER THE BIRD WITH NO FEET FLEW, SHE FOUND TREES WITH NOLIMBS." --- AUDRE LORDEFADE IN:1   EXT/INT. NIGHTCLUB- EVENING                                   1A disembodied gaggle of jersey clad shoulders, jeans, and
    hats crosses a narrow street. Lights flare, hands are
    stamped, torsos are patted down. Money exchanges hands. We
    descend into a black, throbbing tunnel.

    Explicit music booms from bassy club speakers.   Hips, legs
    feet dancing.

    A GO-GO DANCER struts and wiggles around a brass pole.   Hoots
    and cheers.

    The dancer marches in place, rolling her thonged bottom.
    More cheers, greedy hands stuff dollars into her waistband.FEMALE DJ (O.S.)Let's go! Where all my sexy
              Sagittarian ladies at?

    Arms go up.   A collection of whoops ripple the crowd.

    The dancer wraps her legs around the pole and oozes upward
    headfirst. The CAMERA ROTATES as she stretches her booted
    heels into the crowd. We realize that she has been dancing
    on the ceiling.FEMALE DJ (O.S.)Oh my God!

    ALIKE (pronounced AH-LEE-KAY), 17, covers her mouth, laughing
    and wide-eyed. She tries to back away from the stage, but is
    pushed forward by a torrent of eager arms waving dollar
    bills. Among them is LAURA, 18, worldly and smooth.LAURAWhere your singles at?!! Where your
              singles at?!! Yeah, baby!

    Laura strains over Alike's shoulder to tuck a bill into the
    dancer's boot. Alike drops her beer in all the jostling.FEMALE DJGoddamn I love my job!

    Laura stuffs a bill into Alike's now empty hand and forcibly
    waves Alike's wrist in the air.2.Alike pulls free just as the dancer takes notice and begins
    to direct her attention at her.ALIKEStop! Chill!!LAURAWhatchu' come here for?!

    Alike shoves the dollar bill into Laura's chest and shoulders
    her way past the wall of onlookers surrounding the stage.
    Laura shrugs, puts the bill in her teeth and lays her head at
    the edge of the stage. Alike looks away and breaks through a
    snarl of clubgoers just as the dancer begins to descend.ALIKEExcuse me. Sorry. Excuse me. Oof,
              sorry ladies.

    Finally free of the throng, Alike takes a breath and looks at
    the clock on her cell phone.ALIKE (CONT'D)Shit!

    She rolls her eyes back to the stage where Laura is no longer
    visible. Not daring to risk another plunge into the throbbing
    crowd, she retreats for the bar.FEMALE DJLet's go!2   INT. NIGHTCLUB BAR- NIGHT                                     2Alike beaches at an empty spot at the bar. Her gaze settles
    on a CUTE GIRL a little ways down, staring out at the dance
    floor. Alike jerks her eyes away and smooths the front of her
    shirt and adjusts her hat as she edges toward the girl.ALIKEHi.

    The girl ignores her. Alike clears her throat and speaks a
    little too loudly.ALIKE (CONT'D)Umm... Hey! How are you?!

    The girl jerks around and frowns at Alike, looking her up and
    down.CUTE GIRLWhat?!3.ALIKEUmm...sorry. I was just sayin'
              Umm...hi.CUTE GIRLOh.

    The girl dismisses Alike and turns back toward the floor.ALIKEOh. You wanna drink or something?
              Hey! Hey! Over here!

    Alike strains, snapping at the bartender. A CONFIDENT WOMAN
    swaggers up close to the girl and extends her hand. The cute
    girl takes it and allows herself to be lead to the dance
    floor. Alike looks around just in time to see her leaving.
    The bartender finally materializes, and Alike slinks away.3   INT. NIGHTCLUB BATHROOM - NIGHT                                  3Alike slumps into a long line of women waiting to squeeze the
    cramped, 2 stall bathroom. A COUPLE in front of her makes out
    vigorously, and she folds her arms and looks away.

    A buff 30-SOMETHING WOMAN with locs smiles and winks at
    Alike. Alike smiles and fidgets with her eyebrows and looks
    away. The line inches forward. Alike glances around
    searching for the woman. The 30-something has already lost
    interest, her attention now fully directed at a much more
    FEMININE WOMAN strutting out of the restroom. Embarrassed,
    Alike faces front again. Two androgynous gangsters (AGs) who
    have witnessed the whole thing nudge each other and sneer.
    Alike squares her shoulders and widens her stance. One of
    the AG's breaks out in laughter and they turn around as the
    line inches forward again. Alike pretends not to notice and
    slumps out of line and retreats for a lonely oasis of couch
    along the wall.4   INT. NIGHTCLUB COUCH - LATER                                     4Alike dozes on the couch.FEMALE DJGive it up for Sin-A-Min ladies!!

    Alike wakes with a start. She checks the time on her cell
    phone. Cursing, she scrambles up from the couch.4.5   INT. NIGHTCLUB BAR - EVENING                                  5Laura dances with a cute SHORT HAIRED GIRL.

    Alike spots the pair from afar and heads in their direction.ALIKEC'mon, we're late.LAURAHuh?ALIKEI gotta go!LAURAHold on a minute.ALIKEC'mon, why you trippin'?LAURAWhat?ALIKEWhy are you trippin', you know I
              gotta go!LAURAWhat?ALIKEYou know I gotta go.   I'ma get in
              trouble.LAURALemme dance with shortie first,
              then I'll be ready.ALIKEWhat?

    Laura spins the short haired on the dance floor and the pair
    continue their wobbling, uneven groove. Alike endures several
    moments of invisibility as a sea of women, both "feminine"
    and "butch" push past her without a second glance. Alike tugs
    at Laura's jersey. Laura, happily tangled in her dance
    partner's embrace rolls her eyes.LAURAStop pulling on my clothes!5.6   EXT. BUS STOP- NIGHT                                             6Laura sulks, frowning out at the night. Alike extends the
    olive branch.ALIKEHow many numbers you get? One?LAURAI could've gotten more, but your
              moms was holding me up.ALIKEOooh.   That's jacked up.LAURAHow many you get?ALIKETonya, Denise, Shelley. No wait
              that's old, I can delete that one.
              Tonya...

    Laura snatches the phone from Alike. Alike swipes at it but
    misses. Laura fends her off with one hand and scrolls through
    the numbers with the other.LAURAAin't Shelley that chick from your
              math class?! Denise... What?
              These are your damn study group
              numbers! Why you frontin'?!

    Alike snatches the phone and wipes the screen with her
    sleeve.ALIKEI don't see you with no list of
              numbers.LAURAI'm not the one looking for a
              girlfriend, man. You the one still
              a virgin!ALIKEShut up!LAURATrying to help your ass. I'm
              sayin', whatchu waitin' for?!

    Alike shrugs it off, her smile fading a little. Laura elbows
    her and sneers.6.LAURAKickin' that same `ol quiet shit
              since 6th grade. I don't need to
              press, I gets plenty. Shit.ALIKEWah-wah.LAURAI get more pussy than your daddy,
              nigga, what?!ALIKEOh shit!! Yeah, you got me with
              that one.7   INT. BUS - NIGHT                                              7Alike becomes more quiet and less playful as the ride wears
    on. A middle-class Bronx landscape, well-lit with a newly
    constructed Starbucks and renovated condos flits by the
    window. Alike reaches over and presses the tape. Laura elbows
    Alike.LAURAQuit playing.ALIKEYour stop.LAURAHuh?ALIKEYour stop-- you're getting off
              here, right?LAURANah, I'll roll with you a few more
              stops.ALIKEWhy you gon' walk all the way back
              down for? That's stupid.LAURAMake sure you get home okay.

    The bus pulls to the curb. The light flicks on over the back
    door.7.ALIKEYou ain't big, nigga. Trying to
              protect somebody. Hurry up, man,
              get off!LAURA(to bus driver)
              That's alright man--next stop. Next
              stop!

    Alike elbows Laura sharply. The bus driver frowns in the rear
    view.LAURAYou ain't gotta push me, why're you
              beastin'?ALIKEI'm not beastin'.

    Laura climbs over Alike and swings toward the door.LAURAYou got a problem. Call me.ALIKEI'ma call you.

    Alike turns and watches Laura stroll away. Laura drums a
    little beat on Alike's window as the bus pulls off. Alike
    waves and faces forward again. An OLD LADY sitting nearby
    shoots her a disapproving look. Alike rolls her eyes and
    moves to a seat farther away.8   INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS                                         8Alike studies her reflection in the window, and takes a
    breath. She unbuttons her bulky men's shirt to reveal a
    fitting baby doll shirt that reads "Princess." She stuffs
    her baseball cap and durag into her backpack and jabs a pair
    of small gold hoop earrings into her ears. She slumps back
    against the seat and stares into the night.

    The bus stops at a lonely island of curb. Alike is a dark
    silhouette sprinting around the corner and into the night.9   INT. ALIKE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                9Alike cracks open the front door just wide enough to slip
    through. The house is dark except for the flashing microwave
    clock.8.Alike takes off her sneakers and pads down the hallway. Her
younger sister, SHARONDA's door cracks open as she passes.SHARONDAYou late.ALIKE(whispering)
          Be quiet.SHARONDAWhere you been this late?ALIKE(whispering)
          Movies.SHARONDAMovie ended at midnight.ALIKE(whispering)
          Shhh. Shut up.

Alike shoves her sister and tries to close the door. Sharonda
yanks the door open wider.SHARONDA(whispering)
          Don't push me.ALIKE(whispering)
          Go to bed.SHARONDAI know what stays open past
          midnight.

Sharonda puts a hand to her head and does a little dance.ALIKEShut up!

Alike eases Sharonda's door shut.     Sharonda swings the door
open wide.SHARONDAGood night Lee!

Sharonda slams her door.      The light clicks on underneath
Alike's parent's door.9.AUDREY (O.S.)Lee? Lee?!

     Alike rolls her eyes at her sister's closed door and shrugs
     into her room.10   INT. ALIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                     10Alike rushes to shove her stuffed backpack under the bed.
     She tosses her shoes in the closet just as her mother, AUDREY
     appears in the doorway.AUDREYNice to know you still live here.

     Alike peels off her socks and slumps on the bed.AUDREY (CONT'D)What're you doing home so late,
               anyway?ALIKELost track of time.AUDREYYou know what time your curfew is.
               Where were you?ALIKEMovies.AUDREYThe show ended at midnight. And
               your curfew is twelve thirty.ALIKEI lost track of time.

     Audrey gets cozy in the doorjamb.      Alike turns her back on
     her and slumps into pajamas.AUDREYAt least you were cute. Where'd you
               get that shirt? `Princess'. I like
               that.

     Alike winds the princess shirt around her fist and launches
     to the top of the closet.ALIKEIt's old.10.AUDREYCompliments your figure. I saw
               something just like it on sale,
               maybe we could go shopping--ALIKEGoodnight.

     Audrey stiffens and pulls her robe tighter. Vinegar replaces
     honey in her demeanor as the warmth drains out of her voice.AUDREYI really don't care for that young
               lady you run around with anyway.ALIKEYeah, okay!AUDREYAnd tie your head up.

     Alike snags a satin headscarf from the nightstand and slaps
     it around her head.AUDREY(CONT'D)It's your head. And you really
               should wash your face, too.ALIKEI don't have on make-up.AUDREYWash your face anyway.ALIKEMom. I'm seventeen years old,
               please don't talk to me like--AUDREYWatch your tone.
                   (Beat)
               Well, it's your skin.

     Audrey leaves. Alike is still. She listens for the door to
     her parent's room to shut before snatching off the scarf and
     storming to the bathroom.11   INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT                                     11Alike turns on the faucet, wets the soap and puts it back in
     the dish, wets her wash cloth and puts it back on the rack.
     She plops down on the toilet and looks up. A crucifix frowns
     down at her from the wall.11.She averts her eyes and stands to leave.AUDREY (O.S.)Did you brush your teeth?

     Alike wets her toothbrush and throws it back into the holder.AUDREY (O.S.)Lee?

     Alike squeezes out a dollop of toothpaste and smears a little
     around the sink. She stares at her reflection.AUDREY (O.S.)Lee?

     Alike flicks water droplets at the mirror for good measure.ALIKEYes, mom.12   EXT. SCHOOL - MORNING                                     12Alike, bundled in an oversized hoodie edges up to the
     perimeter of campus and waits against a bus shelter. STUDENTS
     horseplay and mill about the entrance in groups, chugging
     their morning Fantas and munching on snack cakes. The school
     bell rings and the lawn slowly empties into the building.
     Alike shifts her weight and checks her watch as the last
     STRAGGLERS finally trickle in. She yanks her hoodie tighter
     and launches across the lawn and into the building.13   INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING                             13A second school bell sounds and the din of slamming lockers
     and jubilant chatter dies to a hush as students shuffle into
     classrooms. Alike cracks the back stairwell door and peeks
     out into the mostly empty hallway before tearing for the
     bathroom. One last straggler BINA, a 17 year-old girl with
     mature, but down-to-earth good looks rushes past Alike. The
     two exchange a brief, confused look then mutually dismiss
     each other as they hurry in opposite directions.14   INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM - MORNING                            14Alike hurtles into the handicapped stall and snaps it shut
     behind her. She rips off her hoodie and the "girly" shirt
     beneath and flings them to the floor. She pulls out a pair of
     wife-beaters from her bag and pulls them over her head. She
     unwads a polo shirt and yanks it over her head.12.She stares at her reflection in the window and tries
     unsuccessfully to smooth her shirt. Her eyes scour her
     reflection again and again for any imperfections. She spots
     the earrings and yanks them out of her ears. The late bell
     beckons and Alike stuffs her "feminine" clothes into her
     backpack and bolts.15   INT. MATH CLASSROOM - DAY                                    15The MATH TEACHER glides up and down the aisles passing out
     graded tests. A chorus of groans follows in her wake.MATH TEACHERAs promised, I will be grading
               these on a curve.

     Alike is folded into the backmost corner of the classroom.
     The desks in front her and beside her are empty. She is
     ignored as the rest of the class chatters and passes notes.MATH TEACHER (CONT'D)But the highest grade on the test
               was a 98.

     The math teacher puts Alike's test on her desk and gives her
     a little smile. Alike doesn't smile back.

     The lunch bell rings and the class is a tornado, clearing the
     room in a rush of limbs, shouts, and backpacks. Alike jabs
     her headphones into her ears and packs her bag very
     deliberately, letting the eye of the storm pass over her
     before heading toward the door.16   INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY                                  16The cafeteria is a whirl of activity and social jockeying.
     Clusters of girls and boys loud-talk, flirt, fight and
     horseplay at tables and in tight little groups against the
     walls. Alike walks alone, staying at the fringes of the crowd
     and shrugs through the cafeteria line.17   INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY                                    17Alike flees the cafeteria, tray laden with rubbery cuisine of
     dubious nutritional value. She raps on the door of a
     classroom and slips in.MRS. ALVARADO (O.S.)Hey there!13.18   INT. AP ENGLISH CLASSROOM - DAY                             18ALIKEHey!

     MRS. ALVARADO, a middle aged Californian ex-hippie type
     reclines with her feet on her desk, munching on celery sticks
     and sunflower seed paste. Her small desk radio plays
     alternative rock. Sun beams into the empty classroom and
     Alike squints as she yanks the headphones out of her ears and
     pulls up a chair next to her desk.MRS. ALVARADOWhaddja bring me?ALIKENothin' you can eat.MRS. ALVARADOYou shouldn't be eatin' that crap,
               either.ALIKE(over a mouthful of pizza)
               I know.MRS. ALVARADOSooo, where's the new stuff?

     Alike hands over her purple and white composition book. Mrs.
     Alvarado thumbs the pages, reading silently.MRS. ALVARADOHmmm.ALIKEDid you see the one in the back?

     Mrs. Alvarado flips to the back of the book and her mouth
     moves silently as she reads.ALIKE (CONT'D)I'll probably do it in class.

     Mrs. Alvarado hands the book back to Alike and digs in to
     another celery stick.ALIKESo?MRS. ALVARADOSo what?14.ALIKEWhat do you think?MRS. ALVARADOThey're okay.ALIKEOkay?MRS. ALVARADOThey're lovely. Of course your
               descriptiveness and use of
               alliteration is beautiful and all,
               you know that. But...I don't know.
               Is it your best? No.

     Alike frowns through the pages of the composition book.ALIKEI thought it was good.MRS. ALVARADOIt's good. Not great.

     Alike slumps back into her seat and considers the book's
     cover.MRS. ALVARADOI believe you can go deeper.19   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON                           19Audrey is a heat-seeking missile, whipping through the sparse
     hallways of the trauma wing, her clipboard and pen in
     constant motion. NURSES and AIDES scatter in her wake,
     suddenly busying themselves with little bits of chore work to
     avoid her caustic gaze. She barks at a cluster of CLERKS chit-
     chatting in the elevator bank and all but one manage to
     escape. Audrey drills her.AUDREYOh, so your log is all up to date?CLERKNo I--AUDREYAnd you've checked the round for
               any calls?CLERKWell I --15.AUDREYDo you even know which doctors are
               on the floor?CLERKNo ma'am I--AUDREYThen I suggest you get busy.

     The clerk skitters off red-faced, and Audrey looks daggers
     into her back before storming the break room.20   INT. HOSPITAL BREAK ROOM - CONTINUOUS                        20Audrey whisks her lunch bag out of the fridge and heads
     toward a table. A few lounging AIDES wad up their garbage and
     flee the break room. Audrey settles down at the table and
     pulls a fashion magazine from her work tote, pretending not
     to be hurt. She peels open a cup of vanilla yogurt and begins
     reading. A big red department store bag sits next to her work
     tote. The television suspended over the table mumbles
     corporate healthcare infomercials. MRS. SINGLETARY, one of
     Audrey's co-workers swoops in and plops a plastic grocery bag
     on the table across from her.MRS. SINGLETARYHey girl! Mind if I sit here?AUDREYNo, not at all. Help yourself.MRS. SINGLETARYWhatchu got there? You been
               shopping?AUDREYOh, no. Just some yogurt. Some
               vanilla yogurt.MRS. SINGLETARYNo I meant in the bag. What do you
               have in the shopping bag--the big
               red thing?AUDREYOh I'm...I don't know where my mind
               is...Yeah, this is just uh--well
               let me get your opinion.

     Audrey's steely exterior melts away and suddenly she is all
     butterflies and giggles. She rifles through the bag and
     hoists out a pink ribbed v-neck sweater.16.MRS. SINGLETARYOh that's nice.AUDREYYeah see isn't this cute?MRS. SINGLETARYUmm-hmm. That's for your daughter?AUDREYYeah, this is for Alike.MRS. SINGLETARYThe youngest one.AUDREYNo she's the oldest one.MRS. SINGLETARYOh, the other one. Okay.AUDREYWhat, you think it's too young?MRS. SINGLETARYNo, no. For whatever reason the
          youngest one popped in my mind
          first. But I think it should be
          fine. It's really cute.AUDREYThank you.MRS. SINGLETARYIt'll compliment her figure.AUDREYNow see that's what I thought...
          But Lee doesn't like anything I
          pick out for her anymore.

Mrs. Singletary takes a bite of her lunch and takes the
sweater from Audrey.MRS. SINGLETARYGirl, please. My oldest, 17 going
          on 27 mind you, banned me from
          buying her any more clothes. We
          have two completely different
          tastes. I just give her gift cards
          now and trust me, we're both
          happier for it. Is it her birthday?17.Mrs. Singletary hands the sweater back to Audrey who smooths
it carefully back into the tissue paper.AUDREYNo, no. I just wanted to get her
          something nice. You know.

Three ROWDY CO-WORKERS burst into the room chattering and
finger popping.ROWDY CO-WORKER #1Hey, Brenda!ROWDY CO-WORKER #2              ROWDY CO-WORKER #3Oooooh Audrey, you got me a     What'chall in here talking
present?                        about?AUDREYWell, no we--MRS. SINGLETARYNone of yo' damn business!!

The co-workers hoot in unison and descend upon the various
parts of the breakroom. Audrey shoves the sweater back in the
bag and nestles it between her feet. Somebody cranks on a
small radio and a frisky R&B beat invades the air. Mrs.
Singletary pats Audrey on the arm.MRS. SINGLETARYLet me know how it goes.AUDREYOh I will. I'll call you when--ROWDY CO-WORKER #3Hey Bren' this is what I was
          telling you about!!

Co-worker #3 shoves a tabloid in Mrs. Singletary's face,
tapping an angry orange fingernail in the middle of the page.MRS. SINGLETARYIs that her?!ROWDY CO-WORKER #3              ROWDY CO-WORKER #2Told you!                       Look how big she done got!

The center of the room shifts and Audrey is once again alone
at the fringes. She collects her shopping bag and looks
around to say goodbye, but no one notices her leave.18.21   INT. ALIKE'S KITCHEN - EVENING                            21Audrey, Sharonda, Alike, and their father, ARTHUR, 40-
     something with a used-to-be athletic build, are all gathered
     around the dinner table for a rare family dinner. Everyone
     takes half-hearted nibbles at their food avoiding eye contact
     with each other. Sharonda picks at her food.SHARONDAI don't see why we can't just watch
               TV like usual.

     Alike elbows Sharonda.SHARONDAQuit it!ALIKEShut up.SHARONDAYou don't tell me what to do!AUDREYGirls.

     The phone rings and Arthur beats a path to bedroom to get it.
     Audrey wilts.ARTHURI'm expecting a call.

     Audrey stares after him then glares back at Alike and
     Sharonda.AUDREYThis is your father's night off.

     Alike casts a glance in the direction of the bedroom, where
     Arthur can be heard talking in hushed tones. She rolls her
     eyes and slinks down into her seat.AUDREY (CONT'D)So straighten up.

     Arthur settles back into his chair, his mood a little
     brighter. Seeing an opportunity for brownie points, Sharonda
     pitches in.SHARONDAHomecoming got moved this year.
               It's gonna be in September instead
               of October.19.AUDREYOh really?SHARONDAYeah. Which means I'll be able to
          go to Autumn Ball and the
          Homecoming Dance.AUDREYWho are you going with?SHARONDAI don't know. Maybe Derek. If he
          asks me. Maybe Parrish. I haven't
          decided yet. But for homecoming, I
          definitely want to go with Craig.AUDREYOooh, I see. Lee, who are you
          going with?ALIKEUmm. I'm not going.

Arthur gives Alike an approving Daddy's girl wink. Alike
beams back.AUDREYNot going? This is your junior
          year. How can you not go?ARTHURLeave her alone Audrey, if doesn't
          want to go, she doesn't have to go.AUDREYBut it's her junior year, she's not
          gonna have any memories.ARTHURI don't like all those boys buzzing
          around my daughters anyway.SHARONDANobody buzzes around Alike.ARTHURThat's right and it better stay
          that way. Matter of fact, I don't
          know if I'ma let you go.SHARONDADaaa-aad?!20.Alike smirks and takes her plate to the sink. Arthur jabs her
     on the arm as she walks by. Audrey tears into a dinner roll
     shooting daggers at anyone who dares to make eye contact.22   INT. LAURA'S KITCHEN - NIGHT                                 22Laura brings a steaming cup of Ramen noodles to a worn
     kitchen table splayed with bills. Her older sister CANDACE,
     a stout 30 something with pleasant but hard-working looks
     scribbles notes on the back of an envelope while soaking her
     feet. Laura takes a sip of her soup and starts sifting
     through a pile of envelopes.LAURAHow much we paid him last time?CANDACESix twenty-five.LAURASo that makes--we owe another two
               seventy-five for the rest of the
               month.

     Candace pecks on a calculator and scribbles on the envelope.
     Laura flips through more bills.LAURA (CONT'D)Electric?CANDACEHalf.LAURAPhone?CANDACELet it ride.LAURAGas?CANDACEHow much?LAURAEighty-five.CANDACEHalf. No let it ride.

     Laura locks her hands on top of her head and leans back in
     her chair, surveying the financial carnage.21.Candace reaches inside a CERAMIC HEN on the table and pulls
out a wad of money. She counts out several hundred dollars
into an envelope.LAURAI can get some more hours--CANDACENo. You know what you need to do.LAURANah Candy, I can't just dip out on
          you like that--CANDACEI was doing just fine before you
          moved in, remember? I can handle
          it.

Laura sucks her teeth.CANDACE (CONT'D)You working was only supposed to be
          temporary. Mom would've wanted--LAURAWho?! Man, don't even--CANDACEShe would've--LAURAStop.

Laura pushes up from the table and glares at Candace, a
showdown. Candace stares back, unfazed. Laura caves first.LAURA (CONT'D)I'll get the money orders in the
          morning.

Laura tugs at the envelope but Candace doesn't let go right
away.LAURA (CONT'D)I'll look into it alright?

Candace relinquishes the envelope and Laura stalks off down
the hallway to her room.CANDACEThe next test is coming up soon!22.LAURA (O.S.)I said I'll look into it!

     Candace smiles wanly and sips her soup. She takes a foot out
     of the water and kneads it.23   INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM - MORNING                            23Alike slams into her usual stall and launches into her
     `Superman' changing routine. She unrolls pulls a jersey from
     her backpack and yanks it over her head.24   EXT. SCHOOL LAWN - AFTERNOON                              24Alike sits off to one side of the stairs, headphoned into
     oblivion and scribbling into her composition book. A group of
     FAST GIRLS strut by and encamp on the opposite wall, giggling
     and yakking on cell phones. One of the girls, MIKA cuts a
     flirty smile at Alike. Alike turns away and buries herself in
     her book, but cranks down the volume on her iPod.MIKA'S FRIENDIt was like seven of us--Me,
               Khalil, Misha, Tamara....FAST GIRL #2Tamara Marks?MIKA'S FRIENDHeeeell no--Fat Tamara.MIKAOh I was about to say, Tamara Marks
               is a ughh--I can't stand her.MIKA'S FRIENDAnyway, it was all of us and oh
               Laura, you know that girl from the
               restaurant? She was there with one
               of her friends.

     Alike's ears prick up.MIKAThat gay chick? Ya'll be hanging
               like that?MIKA'S FRIENDYeah, well it's a couple of them.
               She's mad cool though, so sometime
               she come out with us every now and
               then, anyway--23.MIKAMan, y'all be doin' it on it
          weekends, let me find out!FAST GIRL #2I told your butt to come.MIKA'S FRIENDBut anyway--MIKASome of them AG's are kinda cute--
          I'm not saying I would, but I would
          holla.FAST GIRL #2I don't know about all that.MIKAIsn't that one of them over there?
          What's her name? Amika?--Alisha?

The pack directs their attention at Alike. Alike profiles and
attempts to look casual.MIKA'S FRIENDAlike.MIKAYeah, Alike--she's cute too.FAST GIRL #2Uugh. I don't be looking at them
          all like that.

Mika smiles as her eyes travel down Alike's physique. Alike,
aware of the admiring gaze tugs and smooths at her shirt
unnecessarily. She licks her lips and readjusts the book in
her lap, fighting hard to keep the grin off her face.MIKALook, I'm not gay--but if I was gay
          I might talk to her.MIKA'S FRIENDShe's in the middle anyway.MIKAYeah, but if she was just a little
          more harder--

Alike looks over and starts to nod when a CUTE BOY with locs
swaggers up to the girls, drawing their rapt attention.24.CUTE BOY`Sup ladies?MIKA                           FAST GIRL #2Heeeey.                           What's up?

     The girls erupt into titters, and they melt into
     conversation. Alike deflates, watching them over the top of
     her book. She observes every little moment between the girls
     and the boy, every wink. Another BOY joins the group and they
     stroll off down the sidewalk.

     Alike plucks the headphones out of her ears, watching them
     leave. Mika casts a parting glance over her shoulder at
     Alike. Remnant's of Alike's grin return reflexively. Mika's
     friend jerks her elbow around.MIKA'S FRIENDOooh--let me find out, Mika. You
               act like you bi- or something.MIKAI like girls but I love boys.FAST GIRL #2                      FAST GIRL #1Umm hmm !                         I can't tell!

     Alike waits for them to disappear from view before snatching
     up her bag and bolting in the opposite direction.25   EXT./INT. - RESTAURANT STOCKROOM - DAY                       25Laura hoists a box of french fries onto her shoulder and
     moves inside the restaurant.LAURAWatch out, it's slippery.ALIKESo what do you think?LAURAI already told you what I think.ALIKEBut you know her, right?LAURAI said I know of her, I don't know
               her know her.

     Alike hefts up a box and follows Laura back into the
     restaurant.25.ALIKEI'm saying, you know her friend,
          right? You gonna introduce us?LAURAJust put those on that stack right
          there. Yeah, thank you.ALIKEYou listening?LAURAI'm listening--all I'm saying is--
          pass me that milkshake mix right
          there.

Alike tosses Laura a bladder of milkshake mix. Laura catches
it.LAURAAll I'm saying is that I don't
          think you should put yourself out
          there like that. Especially if you
          don't even know if she likes you
          like that.ALIKEShe does.LAURAHow do you know she does?ALIKEI just know she does.LAURAHmmph. We'll see.

Laura holds out her hand as if checking for rain and scans
the ceiling.ALIKEWhat're you doing?LAURAI thought I felt a drop of pig
          shit.ALIKEShut up.26.LAURAAll I know is I been trying to get
          you to holla at girls in the club
          for the longest.ALIKEI don't want to holla at girls in
          the club.LAURAObviously. Why you pressed about
          this chick?

Alike shrugs.ALIKEI wanted to ask you about something
          else too.LAURAOh God, what now?ALIKEI need you to get something for me.LAURAWhat?!

Alike cocks her head at Laura. Laura frowns back.LAURAWhat?!ALIKEJust for my image.

Alike raises her eyebrow. Laura shakes her head. The light
bulb goes off. She roars in disbelief.LAURAWHAAAAAT???!! You trying to
          strap!!?? Whaaatt?!! Oh my God,
          what are you going through...ALIKEPlease.LAURAWhat difference you think having a
          bulge in your pants gon' make?ALIKEPleeeeease. By next Friday.27.LAURANext Friday?! Okay-- Whatever. Oh
               my God I can't believe you !
               Alright. Yeah. She better be cute
               for all of this...26   INT. ALIKE'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON                            26Alike stares at herself in a floor length bedroom mirror in
     her underwear.LAURAI think it looks natural.

     A peach-colored dildo dangles stiffly from Alike's waist.
     The harness bunches her boxers in clumsy tufts. Alike
     appraises the racially inappropriate apparatus and shoots
     Laura a look.LAURAI'm serious, I mean it doesn't look
               that bad.ALIKEI can't believe you.

     Alike frowns at the dildo in profile.LAURAWhat?!ALIKELaura, this doesn't look right.
               I'ma look stupid.LAURAWell, first of all-- I don't think
               its supposed to be on top of your
               underwear like that.ALIKEI'm not putting this thing next to
               my skin, it pinches already.

     Alike yanks at the harness and her boxers trying to pull it
     out of her bottom.LAURAIt's supposed to fit like that.ALIKEThey didn't have any brown?28.LAURAI didn't have time for all of that.
          The brown ones were too big,
          anyway.

Alike struggling with the apparatus.   Laura smiles.ALIKEUgh! You gotta take it back.LAURAI can't take it back.ALIKEHere's the receipt!LAURAUnh-unh. I'm not going back in
          there. One time was embarrassing
          enough.ALIKEYou grown!LAURAStill what if somebody would see me
          in there? I'm not going back,
          that's it.ALIKEThen where's my change?

Sharonda bursts into the room.SHARONDALee, where'd you put my make-up
          case...AHHH I'M GON' TELL. OOH LEE,I'MA TELL DADDY!Laura leaps from the bed and blocks Sharonda's path to the
doorway. Alike tackles Sharonda and wrestles her down to the
floor. Laura slams the door, shuts and locks it.SHARONDAEeew get that thing, off a me! Get
          it off me it's nasty! I'm tellin'!LAURAShhh!!ALIKEShut up!!! Thought you locked the
          door?!29.SHARONDAEeew.    Get it offa me!LAURAI did!ALIKEOK, look I'm offa you.     Just be
          quiet and calm down.SHARONDAI'm tellin' that you got that
          thing.LAURAYou can't tell.SHARONDAI'm telling.ALIKEShut up.SHARONDAIt looks nasty.ALIKE(to Laura)
          See, I told you so.SHARONDAWhere's my make up case?    I know
          you got it.ALIKEI just borrowed it.

Alike pulls off the dildo and harness.SHARONDAGive it back.

Alike fishes the make-up case out of her backpack. She holds
it out to Sharonda. Sharonda reaches for it. Alike jerks it
back.ALIKEPromise you won't tell.SHARONDAGive it back.

Alike flips open the make up case and jabs the dildo at it,
stopping short of the surface of the make up.30.SHARONDALEE, STOP IT EEEW!!! I just got
          that one.LAURAShhh!!SHARONDADon't touch it with that... eeww
          that's so nasty. C'mon Lee give it
          back.LAURAThen promise you won't tell.ALIKEPromise...SHARONDAUghh, I hate you.

Alike jabs the dildo closer to the make-up.SHARONDAOK, OK I won't tell.   Daag!

Alike tosses the case at Sharonda who scrambles to catch it.
Alike wraps the dildo back up in the bag and hides it behind
her headboard. Sharonda saunters out into the hallway.SHARONDAI'm still tellin'AUDREYTellin' what?

Audrey peers into the bedroom from the hallway, still dressed
for work, shoulder stooped from the weight of her tote bag.ALIKE                           SHARONDANoth--                           She took my makeup again.AUDREYLee...
              (notices Laura)
          Oh. Hello Laura, I didn't see you
          standing there.LAURAHi Mrs. Freeman.AUDREYHow's your mother?31.LAURAI haven't spoken to her in awhile.
               She's fine.AUDREYWell I hope so. And I'm so glad to
               hear your sisters finally getting
               back on her feet. Wasn't she--LAURAShe's good.ALIKEMom?!

     Audrey fixes Laura with another hard glance and shoos
     Sharonda down the hallway. Laura starts to shut the door, but
     Audrey stops it with her arm.AUDREYI think we'll just leave this open.
               Let some air circulate in here.LAURAI was just about to leave, anyway.
               So...

     Audrey lingers, looking back and forth between Laura and
     Alike. Alike frowns at her mother.

     Satisfied that the conversation is over, Audrey moves off
     toward her room. Laura checks to make sure she's gone and
     whispers to Alike.LAURAJust try it.27   INT. NIGHTCLUB COUCH - EVENING                               27Alike squirms in her seat.LAURAWill you chill? You just gotta get
               used to it.

     Alike tugs at her crotch and attempts to cross her legs.ALIKEOwwww!

     Alike uncrosses her legs and yanks at her jeans. Laura bats
     her hand away.32.LAURASit still, people gon' think you
               got something.ALIKEThis joint hurts, man. I'ma go take
               it off.LAURAYou not gon' take it off.ALIKEI'm gonna take it off.LAURAWhere you gonna take it off at?ALIKEIn the bathroom.LAURAThen where you gon' put it? You
               gonna walk around the club with a
               dick in your hand? Chill. I knew we
               shouldn't have done this. You
               blowin' me right now.ALIKEThen I'm out.LAURANah, you're `bout to stay and go
               through this. You're the one who
               wanted to meet her, not me.ALIKEThen you come on, too. Hurry up--

     A group of girls approaches, one of them we recognize as
     Mika, the girl that likes Alike, from the bathroom. Laura
     stands to greet them. Nervous introductions all around. Laura
     shoots Alike a warning glance.28   INT. NIGHTCLUB COUCH - LATER                              28Laura is hugged up with two girls at the end of the couch.
     Alike fidgets in her seat and keeps pulling at the knees of
     her jeans. Mika hand in chin, stares into space. Alike does
     another pull-fidget combo. Mika rolls her eyes at her.MIKAYou alright?33.ALIKEYeah, no, yeah it's just--there's a
               spring in the cushion or something.MIKAYou wanna switch seats?ALIKENo, I'm good.MIKAAnd you don't wanna dance?LAURAHey ya'll we're about to go dance!ALIKENo, no not really. I'm not really
               feeling the music.

     Mika sighs and looks around at the other dancing couples.
     Alike gives her jeans another tortured tug. Agonized minutes
     of awkward booming silence.MIKAWell you don't mind right? I mean
               you don't mind if I go dance with
               somebody else?ALIKENo, do your thing.MIKAIf you change your mind--ALIKENo, no it's cool.

     Mika escapes the couch and disappears into the crowd.29   INT. ALIKE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                               29Alike slips off her shoes and eases through the kitchen.
     Audrey flicks on the light, blocking the hallway entrance.AUDREYI hope it was worth it.ALIKEMom I lost--AUDREYSave it.34.ALIKEIt won't happen--AUDREYOh I know it won't.30   INT. ALIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                 30Alike peels off her jeans and lobs them into the top of her
     closet. She unharnesses the dildo and wads the tangled mess
     up in an old t-shirt. She stuffs the wad in back of the
     closet and slams the closet door shut, staring at her
     reflection in the mirror.

     Alike reconsiders and yanks the wad back from the closet.31   EXT. ALIKE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                               31Alike stuffs the wad into a trash bag and plunges it deep
     into a neighbor's garbage can. She scurries back into her
     building and doesn't look back.32   INT. ALIKE'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING                           32Alike skulks on the couch in wrinkled khaki pants and a
     cotton button down shirt. An obnoxious R&B video plays on the
     TV. Sounds of bustling and the drone of a hair dryer fill the
     room.AUDREY (O.S.)Turn that mess off!!

     Alike turns the television volume to low and continues
     watching.AUDREY (O.S.)Sharonda?! Sharonda are you ready?!
               Stop lollygagging!SHARONDA (O.S.)I'm coming!AUDREYLee are you ready?! Lee?!

     Audrey hobbles out with one high heel on. She snatches the
     remote from Alike and snaps the TV off.AUDREY (CONT'D)I said off. Thought you were ready?35.ALIKEI am ready.AUDREYYou're not going to church looking
               like that. Where's the blouse I
               bought you?ALIKEWhat's wrong with this?

     The front door bursts open, and Arthur tromps in, his police
     uniform hanging open over a white undershirt. He slings a
     heavy F.O.P tote bag on the floor and strips off his shirt as
     he crosses to the kitchen. Audrey rushes over and buzzes
     around him.33   INT. ALIKE'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS                         33AUDREYHey there, you're home early--well
               actually late. I thought you would
               have called--ALIKEDad--ARTHURDo what your mom says.

     Audrey scuttles over to where Arthur is now digging through
     the open fridge. He pulls out a foil covered plate, tears
     open one corner, sniffs it.AUDREYAre you hungry? Let me heat it up
               for you.

     Arthur heads toward the microwave with the plate. Audrey

     skillet.AUDREY (CONT'D)I'll heat it up on the stove for
               you. Tastes better.ALIKEDad--AUDREYLee!36.ARTHURLeave me out of it.AUDREYGo get changed.ALIKEDad, what's wrong with this outfit?ARTHURNothing.ALIKESee?AUDREYI'm not gonna argue with you.ARTHURDo what she says.ALIKEDad--ARTHUR(speaking bad Tarzan
               Swahili)
          Umgowa!AUDREYAnd put on a skirt!

Alike stalks off to her bedroom. Sharonda bounces into the
kitchen.SHARONDAHey Dad!AUDREYToo much lipstick.SHARONDAIt's lipgloss.

Audrey wheels on Sharonda with a death glare.SHARONDA (CONT'D)Okay, okay.ARTHURGimmie kiss.

Sharonda pecks dad on the cheek. Dad wipes his cheek and rubs
his fingers together.37.Sharonda giggles and bounds back into her bedroom. Audrey
slides a steaming plate in front of Arthur.AUDREYDid you talk to her?ARTHURGet me a beer, please. Sharonda's
          fine.AUDREYI'm talking about Lee.ARTHURAlike. And I don't see that there's
          a problem.AUDREYI'm tired of this tomboy thing
          she's got going on. And Laura. You
          said you were going to handle it.ARTHURUmm-hmm.AUDREYShe needs a male point of view.ARTHURI said okay, dammit! Now can I
          please have a beer please?AUDREYIt's Sunday morning.ARTHURIt goes with the spaghetti.

Audrey lifts a beer out of the fridge and slides it in front
of Arthur. She pulls up a chair as he plows through the meal,
her expression softening as she caresses his forearm.AUDREYDo you have to work tonight?ARTHURTo put food on the table and
          clothes on our backs, no. To go out
          to restaurants and keep designer
          sneakers in the closet, yes.AUDREYAre you forever gonna be mad?38.ARTHURAre you forever going to be happy?
               (beat)
          You made that decision a long time
          ago.AUDREYWe both made sacrifices.

Alike stomps back into the kitchen wearing the pink v-neck
that Audrey bought her and an unflattering pleat-front skirt.
Arthur stifles a giggle behind his beer can.ARTHURYou look beautiful, baby.AUDREYTuck your blouse in.ALIKEThis isn't me.AUDREYTuck your blouse in.ARTHURLeave it out.

Audrey frowns at Arthur. Arthur stands his ground.ARTHUR (CONT'D)I think it's fine out. What's the
          deal with you and Laura?ALIKEWhat deal?AUDREYComin' in late...ALIKEDad, I hardly ever--ARTHURWhy don't you give that a break for
          a little while?ALIKEDad, come on...AUDREY(to Alike)
          You heard him!(MORE)39.(to Sharonda)
               Sharonda! You done?!

     Alike spins into the living room defeated.SHARONDA (O.S.)Coming!AUDREYYou coming with us?ARTHURNope. Sleep.AUDREYWe could go to a later service. The
               one o'clock--ARTHURI said NO!!

     Arthur slams his fork on the plate. Audrey flinches. Alike
     looks up. Sharonda appears in the doorway, looking from
     Audrey to Arthur.SHARONDAI'm ready.

     Arthur pushes up from the table.ARTHURAlike, you look beautiful.
               Everybody looks beautiful, okay?

     Arthur disappears into the bedroom. Alike snatches up her
     bible and launches out the door, Sharonda follows. Audrey
     pulls on her sunglasses and hat and slams the door behind
     her.34   EXT. CHURCH - DAY                                            34Alike sits in the passenger seat of the car as Audrey chit
     chats with other churchgoers. Sharonda sits in the back
     seat, flipping through a CD case and occasionally passing
     CD's to Alike to play. Alike faces stonily forward except to
     cast impatient glances in Audrey's direction. Audrey raps on
     the window.AUDREYLee! Lee! Here's someone I want you
               to meet.

     Alike cracks the window an inch.40.ALIKEHuh?

Audrey motions to Bina standing by with her mother, Ms.
Singletary. Alike cracks the window a little wider and
acknowledges them with a half-hearted wave.ALIKE (CONT'D)Oh. Hey.AUDREYGet down out the car and come
          speak.

Laboriously, Alike rolls the window back up, turns off the
car radio, and climbs down out of the car.AUDREY (CONT'D)What's wrong with you?ALIKEAlright, Mom.AUDREYYou'll have to excuse her, she's
          been feeling rude lately.MRS. SINGLETARYOh don't worry, Audrey, I
          understand how it is. Hormones.
          It's just a phase.AUDREYAlike, this is Mrs. Singletary, one
          of my co-workers and her daughter,
          Bina. Sylvia, Bina, this is my
          daughter Alike, we call her "Lee"
          for short.

Alike shakes both of their hands in turn.ALIKEHi.MRS. SINGLETARYHello.ALIKENice to meet you.BINAHi.41.AUDREYAnd this is my youngest daughter,
          Sharonda.SHARONDAHi.BINAHi.MRS. SINGLETARYHi there, nice to meet you.AUDREYLee, Bina goes to the same school

          Mrs. Alvarado's class right? AP
          English?ALIKEYup.

Audrey looks pleased with herself. Alike squirms.AUDREYSo. Now that we're all acquainted,
          don't be a stranger.MRS. SINGLETARYOh no, we won't.AUDREYBina I think you and Lee may even
          go to school the same way. Don't
          you live off of St. James Place?MRS. SINGLETARYThere is something to be said for
          safety in numbers.

Bina nods. Alike squirms.MRS. SINGLETARY (CONT'D)Well, we need to be pushing off --
          I'll call you about those VBS
          workbooks.42.Alike retreats into the car, Sharonda hops in behind her.
     Alike reaches over and turns the key in the ignition.AUDREYAlrighty, I'll be around. Take
               care.

     Alike toots the horn. Audrey circles and gets in the driver's
     side.35   INT. FAMILY CAR - CONTINUOUS                                35ALIKEYou're funny.AUDREYI don't know what your problem is.SHARONDACan somebody put in this CD please?

     Audrey cranks the ignition and starts to back out.ALIKEI don't know what you think is
               going to change.AUDREYI know God doesn't make mistakes. I
               know that much.

     An invisible scab is ripped open in Alike and the fire dies
     in her eyes. Satisfied, Audrey slips the car into gear.AUDREY (CONT'D)You may not like Bina, but you're
               certainly gonna be spending much
               less time with that Laura person, I
               guarantee you that much.SHARONDAMoooom, can you--AUDREYBe quiet. Nobody's putting in
               anything. I'm gonna listen to what
               I want to listen to for a change.

     Alike wilts against the window and tacky zydeco music leaks
     from the car as it jerks away from the curb and into traffic.43.36   EXT. STREET - DAY                                          36Alike strides down the sidewalk.   Bina speedwalks to keep up.BINALook, I don't like lying to my
               mother, that's all.ALIKEThen don't, she doesn't have to
               know.BINAShe does.    She asks me everyday.ALIKESo tell her yeah.BINANo, I'm sick of lying to cover for
               you.ALIKESo don't.

     Bina stops short.   Alike keeps walking.BINALook Alike, Lee. Whatever it is you
               wanna be called. I'm not trying to
               hang out with you, either, but I'm
               not about to take an L for it. So
               stop dodging me, let's just go to
               school together and be done with
               it. We don't have to see each
               other any other time than that.

     Alike doesn't miss a step.    Bina yells after her.BINA (CONT'D)Whatever, my mother asks me again,
               I'm telling her. Then she can tell
               your mother, then it's whatever for
               you.

     Alike stops short. Bina crosses the street and continues in
     the direction away from school. Alike spins around scanning
     the street, then catches sight of her on the opposite
     sidewalk.ALIKEHey!

     Bina keeps on pushing, the school now in sight.44.ALIKE (CONT'D)Hey!

Alike checks for traffic then dashes across the street to
catch up with her.ALIKE (CONT'D)Hey look, I'm sorry.BINAYeah, you sorry your mom is gonna
          bug out.ALIKENo for real, I'm sorry. I didn't
          mean to be that way. It's just...
          OK, I am concerned that my, my mom
          will find out, but...BINABut?ALIKEIt's not like that. It's just--
          she's just. If you knew her, you'd
          understand. She's like, I don't
          know.

The girls walk in silence for a moment.ALIKE (CONT'D)So what's your favorite class?BINAYou don't have to make small talk.
          Let's just walk.ALIKEI said I'm sorry. It's not you,
          it's just that my mom is like,
          she's like...BINAOverprotective?

Alike relaxes her shoulders, both relieved and surprised.ALIKEYeah.BINAI can tell. I've seen--I mean, a
          lot of people's parents are like
          that.45.ALIKEYeah?BINAYeah.ALIKEYeah. But probably not like mine.
               But anyway...BINAAnyway, like I said, we don't have
               to talk. Just walk.

     Alike's cell phone chirps--it's Laura.    Alike sighs and
     stuffs the phone back into her pocket.37   INT. LAURA'S BEDROOM - DAY                                    37ALIKE (V.O.)Hi! This is Lee, I'm not able to
               answer my phone right now--

     Laura snaps her cell phone shut. A GED study book still
     glossy and uncreased is propped open on the bed in front of
     her. She opens her cell phone again and pulls up Alike's
     number. Her thumb hovers over the `talk' button. She snaps
     the phone shut and tosses it aside before turning the radio
     down and dragging the book closer. The cell phone rings and
     she snatches it up. A picture of a girl making a kissy face
     with the name "Tasha" underneath blinks onto the screen and
     Laura snaps the phone shut and tosses it aside. She hoists
     the GED book into her lap and lets her head hit the wall.
     There is a knock at her bedroom door and Candace peeks in.CANDACEHow's it comin'?LAURAIt's good.

     Candace smiles at Laura and hesitates before closing the
     door. Candace turns the radio off before ducking back out.
     Laura sighs and flips back to the beginning of the book.38   INT. SPORTS CLUB BASKETBALL COURT - DAY                       38Alike and Arthur cavort in a sloppy half-court game in the
     fluorescent glare of the gym. Well-heeled clientele cross to
     and fro munching power bars and sipping Gatorade. Arthur has
     an awful shot, but Alike's is worse. Alike heaves a huge
     airball past the basket.46.ARTHUROh my God!!

     Alike cracks up as Arthur chases down the ball.ARTHUR (CONT'D)That's just embarrassing!ALIKEYou ain't got no range, either.ARTHURYeah but at least I hit the
               backboard. Damn.

     Alike rushes to guard Arthur who dribbles clumsily around the
     key. He tries a crossover move and lobs an ugly shot toward
     the basket.ALIKEBrick!!

     Laughing, they tussle over the rebound. Arthur recovers.ARTHURWhat's the score?ALIKEOne up.ARTHUROne?ALIKEYup!ARTHUROne? Nah, I definitely have like
               three. At least three.

     Giggling, the pair rollick in another squeaky-shoed play.39   INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT                                    39MACK, the store proprietor leans against the counter flipping
     through a newspaper. Arthur, in uniform mulls through the
     sports section. A ratty looking man, SOCK sips from a red
     plastic cup.

     Mack cranks the volume on the tiny television above the
     counter.47.MACKIt's on again... Check it out Free.
          Channel 5 and Channel 2.

Arthur appears on the TV screen, dressed in suit, tie,
sunglasses and looking impressive. He is talking to a news
reporter and a bad news graphic reading "East Side Drug Bust--
Detective Arthur Freeman" blots out the bottom of the screen.SOCKLook who's big time.MACKBrother was looking clean though.
          Looked just like, look like...uh--
          Danny Glover!

Arthur and Mack laugh and slap hands. Sock sneers at their
revelry.

The bell over the door tinkles and a heavyset BUTCH WOMAN
strolls in. Her head is shaved and a thick wallet chain
clinks against her ample carpenter pants. All three men turn
to stare.MACK (CONT'D)Been more of that since they opened
          up that new club `cross the way.

Arthur grunts and returns to his paper.SOCK(to Butch Woman)
          Excuse me Miss??!! Miiiiissss??!!MACKCertain Friday nights they got, you
          know special parties going on.SOCKOr should I say Sir??!! Siiiir??!!
          Hello?!!ARTHURChill out, Sock.SOCKHey, my man! You hear me talkin' to
          you?!

Mack snatches Sock's cup. Sock pivots around to protest.SOCKHey!!48.MACKMind your business.

Sock yanks his cup back and turns to resume his taunts. He's
caught off guard and stumbles backward as the woman pushes up
to the counter with a case of liquor. Arthur steps out of the
way and observes.BUTCH WOMANAnd a pack of Kools.

Mack nods and fishes under the counter.SOCKSay, I been trying to get your
          attention. Do you go by Sir or
          Miss?MACKThat'll be all ma'am?BUTCH WOMANYeah.SOCKLook I just had a simple question I
          wanted to ask. See, I just want to
          know how does pussy taste?

The woman directs her full attention at Sock for the first
time. Mack watches as he quickly punches in the sale. Arthur
stiffens.SOCK (CONT'D)You know, I just wanna know if you
          go with women for the taste, or is
          it just you're too big, black, and
          ugly so don't no man want you?

Sock laughs at his own nasty joke and takes a sip from his
cup.MACK$65.07 ma'am.

The woman counts out the money and smiles at Sock.BUTCH WOMANI can't lie, pussy do taste good.SOCKOh yeah?

The woman takes her time putting away her change.49.BUTCH WOMAN (CONT'D)Maybe you should try it yourself
          sometime. Or better yet--

The woman picks up her case.BUTCH WOMAN (CONT'D)--ask yo' wife how she likes me!

The woman winks at Sock. Arthur chokes back a guffaw. As soon
as the woman clears the door, Arthur and Mack explode in
laughter. Sock is livid and screams after her.SOCKFuckin' Bulldagger! He-She! Dyke!MACKAsk your wife!ARTHURShe told you.SOCKShe ain't tell me shit! I don't
          know what the fuck y'all niggas are
          laughing for!MACKAwww shut up. Your big mouth got
          you in trouble as usual.SOCKThought you was my friend, Mack.
          But I guess I ain't expect you to
          defend me Free, the way your
          daughter is--

Arthur slams Sock against the counter before he can finish
his sentence.ARTHURSay what?!MACKHe don't mean nothin'! He don't
          know what he's talking about!

Arthur grinds Sock's collar tighter around his trembling
fist. Sock glares back, clearly punked.MACK (CONT'D)He ain't moved outside a two-mile
          radius of where he crawled out his
          mammy's pussy. He don't know shit.50.SOCK(to MACK)
               I been to Poughkeepsie!

     Arthur snorts and flings Sock loose.MACKCarry your Poughkeepsie ass on out
               of my store!

     Mack sweeps Sock's plastic cup off the counter and into a
     garbage can. Sock tromps to the door.SOCKFuck y'all!ARTHURI should arrest your ass.SOCKMan, fuck y'all!!MACKFree, don't pay him no mind. Just
               talkin' trash.

     Mack playfully jabs him in the shoulder and bustles
     underneath the counter. Arthur's eyes linger on the door and
     his jaw tightens.40   INT. LAURA'S KITCHEN - DAY                                  40Laura swings through the front door of her apartment, Alike
     close behind. She slides two twenty dollar bills underneath
     the ceramic hen on the table and breezes into her bedroom.41   INT. LAURA'S BEDROOM - LATER                                41Alike is a paper doll in Laura's floor length mirror, dressed
     only in boxers and a wife beater. Laura holds a bright orange
     polo shirt up in front of Alike's torso. Alike cocks her head
     to the side and considers.LAURADamn, this is your color. So what's
               the deal incog-negro?ALIKEMom has me hemmed up.51.LAURAYour phone ain't broke. You coulda
          called a nigga. Put this on.

Laura pulls away the orange polo shirt and hands Alike a
turquoise one instead. Alike hoists the oversized shirt over
her head.ALIKEMy bad. She's making me hang out
          with this chick from church. It's
          crazy.LAURAMakin' you?! You a grown-ass woman,
          bruh!

Laura shakes her head as she plucks a brand new baseball cap
from the wall rack and drops it onto Alike's head. Alike
considers and takes it off. Laura puts another cap in its
place. Before Alike can object, Laura tosses her a pair of
denim shorts.LAURA (CONT'D)Try these with it. So I guess the
          piers is out for Saturday, huh?ALIKEI don't even know if that's me
          anymore.

Alike struggles into the jean shorts, widening her stance so
they don't fall down. Laura tosses her a belt and admires
Alike's reflection.LAURAYeah, that's hot, yo. You should
          rock that.ALIKE (CONT'D)I was gonna see if you wanna do
          something different?

Alike strips off the baseball cap and hangs it back on the
rack.LAURADifferent like what?

Alike peels out of the polo shirt.ALIKEI don't know--maybe like a open mic
          or something.52.LAURAOpen mic? Nah, man. It's plenty
               chicks at the piers, you just gotta
               be more confident.

     Laura crosses to her closet and scans its inventory. The
     jeans are arranged crisply on hangers from light to dark and
     some still have store tags. Most of the shirts are still
     enclosed in protective plastic covers from the dry cleaners.
     Laura passes Alike a perfectly folded button down shirt.LAURA (CONT'D)You can rock this. I haven't even
               worn it yet. But I understand if
               you got better things to do.

     Alike holds the shirt against her torso and stares at her
     reflection. She catches Laura's eager look in the mirror and
     wilts.ALIKENah, I'm down.LAURAYou sure? I don't want you getting
               hemmed up.ALIKENah seriously, I'm down for
               whatever.LAURAReal?ALIKEPromise.LAURAThat's what's up! I'ma take the
               whole day off. It's gonna be tight
               watch... we gon' do it up!

     Laura holds a new pair of jeans against her body and does a
     little dance. Alike laughs wanly.42   INT. ALIKE'S PARENT'S BEDROOM - EVENING                   42Audrey sits between Alike's knees as Alike oils her scalp.
     Alike takes her time, massaging each braid between her hands
     before moving to the next. Audrey reads an Essence magazine,
     the cover of which reads "101 Ways to Please Your Man."53.ALIKEYou should wear your hair down
               sometimes.AUDREYYour father likes it up.ALIKEIt looks nice down.

     Alike catches her mother's eye in the mirror's reflection,
     they share a sad moment. Audrey closes the magazine and
     tosses it back onto the bed.AUDREYMaybe. Anyway give this back to
               Bina's mom when you go over

          commercial bullshit.

Alike checks the time on her phone.ALIKEShit!

Alike starts packing her backpack.ALIKE (CONT'D)Just more underground stuff. None

time.ALIKEUh-oh, whatchu know about
          Bahamadia? Let me find out....BINAI'm not as generic as you think.

The phone rings. Mrs. Singletary answers from another room.
Alike and Bina freeze, listening.MRS. SINGLETARY (O.S.)Hello? Hi Audrey. Yes. Yeah she's
          here. I understand--

Alike sulks. Bina flips to the back of the CD book.BINAAlright, how about Rock?ALIKEIt's cool.BINAWhatchu know about Santogold? Since

Alike hoists the backpack onto her shoulder and stands to
leave.BINAOh no this is way better, you gotta
          check her out.

Bina jams her iPod onto the stereo adapter. The thick, fierce
guitar rhythms of Tamar-kali's "Boot" consume the room. Bina
chants the lyrics along with the music.BINA (CONT'D)"Her hair is short. Her legs are
          brown. Her lips are full. Her head

     and shoves it into the fridge. The doorbell rings and she
     rushes across the room and opens the door in her most sing-
     song voice.AUDREYHe-llooo.LAURAHello Mrs. Freeman. Is Lee home
               please?AUDREYShe's out with her friend right
               now, Laura. You take care.

     Audrey starts to close the door.   Laura stops it with her
     hand.LAURAOh. Umm do you know when she'll be
               back?AUDREYNo, I believe she's out for the
               evening.LAURAOh, because we had umm... alright
               then... Thank you.AUDREYGoodnight.

     Audrey shuts the door harder than necessary. Laura checks her
     phone and shakes her head.45   INT. BINA'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME INTERCUT                     45BINA"Twist a virgin `round your dirty

     Alike is bobbing her head, backpack forgotten on her
     shoulder. Bina cranks the volume down.ALIKEYo, this shit is hot!BINATold you. Don't you have to go?
               I'll cover. It's cool.ALIKENah, I wanna stay.

     Alike slings her backpack to the floor and pulls the CD book
     into her lap. Her cell phone rings and she ignores it.46   EXT. THE PIERS - LATER                                    46The pier is a parade of mohawks, curly weaves, tight jeans,
     and rainbow belts as groups of baby dykes, young queens, and
     gender queer youth of all shades of brown stroll cavort, and
     strut seeing and wanting to be seen. Equally bedecked
     observers hoot and yell from bench and rail perches on both
     sides. Laura jabs numbers into her cell phone. Competing
     threads of house music throb across the boardwalk in muffled
     bursts as groups of ballers vogue and prance behind her.ALIKE (V.O.)Leave a message and I'll call you
               back. BEEP.

     Laura yanks her phone away from her ear and looks at the
     screen. She starts to hang up but pulls it back to her ear.LAURAWhere you at? Hit me up when you
               get here.47   INT. BINA'S BEDROOM - LATER                               47Alike and Bina are sprawled in the floor. Bina DJ's from her

     in her pocket and pulls her hoodie up against the chill of
     the evening. Brake lights bathe Laura and her circle of AG's
     in red as late-night predators cruise the strip for fresh
     meat. Laura catches sight of shady sexual encounters in an
     alley across the street and looks away. One of the entourage
     passes Laura a joint and she inhales deeply. A few of the
     girls have backpacks and the group is pensive as they break
     off and scatter into the night one by one.PIER GIRL #1`Member when we used to stay out
               here all night?PIER GIRL #2Shit, used to?PIER GIRL #1You stay with your sister now, huh?

     Laura nods and spits.PIER GIRL #2Lucky as hell.49   INT. AP ENGLISH CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON                        49AP English class is a safe haven. The desks are pulled
     together in a rough circle and are filled with heavily
     pierced, dyed hair, and vintage clothes types. Mrs. Alvarado
     sits cross-legged atop her desk taking notes. Alike stands at
     the center of the circle reciting an original poem.ALIKEA butterfly, briefly

               what you think.

     A forest of hands go up as Alike winds her way back to her
     seat. A few classmates whisper brief encouragements. Bina
     nods and smiles at Alike. Unguarded, Alike smiles back.50   EXT. STREET - DAY                                            50Bina and Alike troop home at a more leisurely pace. Alike
     breaks the silence for once.ALIKEI liked your story, though. It was
               tight.BINAYeah? Which one? The one about the--ALIKEThe one about karma, how things
               come back to you. That one, I

               too.ALIKEWhy?60.BINAWhy did I like it or why wasn't I
gonna say anything?ALIKEWhy did you like it?BINAI don't know. I guess because it
felt honest.ALIKEOh.BINADidn't you have on a different

     Bina stops.ALIKEWhat?BINAThis is me.

     Alike looks up at the stoop, surprised.BINA (CONT'D)It's not so bad when there's some
               conversation, huh?

     Alike looks away.BINA (CONT'D)You wanna come up?51   INT. BINA'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON                             51Alike sits on Bina's twin bed, looking around and really
     taking in the room for the first time. She reaches over and
     picks up a little molded soldier figure off of the shelf.
     Bina fishes around in a rack of CDs.ALIKEWho gave you this?BINAWhat the bear? My dad.ALIKENo, this.

     Alike holds the figurine out, Bina looks at it over her
     shoulder.BINAOh that. Girl, my stupid ex-
               boyfriend gave me that.ALIKEOh. Cute.

     Bina opens a CD case and pulls the booklet out.62.BINANot really. I mean I guess it was
          at the time.

Bina lobs the little army man into a trash can across the
room and hands Alike the booklet.BINA (CONT'D)Anyway, this is the other artist I
          was telling you about. Her stuff is
          like, bouncier.

A buoyant Afropunk beat wafts through the bedroom. Bina plops
down on the bed next to Alike.ALIKEThis is straight. You'll burn me a
          copy?BINAYeah, I have a bunch of other
          stuff, too.
              (beat)
          So who do you hang out with? I
          don't really see you with anybody.

Alike shrugs and rifles through her backpack. She pulls out
her composition book. Awkward silence.BINA (CONT'D)I didn't mean it like that. I was
          just asking because I was curious.
          I don't really like anybody that
          goes there either.ALIKEMy friend Laura used to go there.
          Not now, but she's going back.BINAOh because, I was just gonna say--
          I'm going to this house party and
          you can come if you want to.

Bina waves her hand at the radio.BINA (CONT'D)They play this kind of music.ALIKESure. How'm I supposed to dress?63.BINAYou don't dress. You just come
          however. Come as you are.

Alike nods.BINA (CONT'D)Can I see?

Bina snatches the book from Alike's hands and starts flipping
through pages before Alike can answer.ALIKEYeah...But that's mainly old stuff,
          though.BINAThis is the one you did today?ALIKEYeah.BINANice.

Bina offers the journal back to Alike. Alike reaches for it.
Bina pulls it away at the last second--an impromptu game of
keep away.BINA (CONT'D)Take it.

Alike misses again. The girls crack up.BINA (CONT'D)Sorry, here.

Bina yanks it away again. Alike gives up, still smiling.ALIKEYou play too much.BINASeriously, it's right here.     Just
          take it.

Alike summons the courage for one last swipe. She manages to
grab it but Bina doesn't let go right away. The girls lock
eyes during the extemporaneous tug-of-war.ALIKEThank you...64.BINAYou're welcome...

     Beaming with her victory, Alike busies herself with the
     journal. Bina recruits a small stuffed moose for her next
     foray. She dances the moose up Alike's arm and plants an
     exaggerated peck on her cheek with it.BINA (CONT'D)Mmmwaahhh!

     The girls erupt into renewed giggles. Bina tosses the stuffed
     animal aside and scoots closer to read over Alike's shoulder.BINA (CONT'D)What's so private?ALIKENothin', just my writings...

     Bina studies Alike's profile. She leans in and pecks Alike on
     the cheek. Alike lets the kiss soak in, glancing at Bina
     sidelong. Bina leans in again, this time planting a long kiss
     on Alike's lips. Alike pulls away. Bina tenses for the
     verdict.ALIKE (CONT'D)Why'd you do that for?BINASorry---ALIKENo, I'm sorry. I just umm...I gotta
               go.BINAI thought--ALIKESorry.

     Alike blindly grabs up her things and rushes the door, Bina
     flounders in her wake.52   INT. LAURA'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING                          52Laura and a group of friends play a rowdy game of spades. A
     cute Puerto Rican girl is draped around Laura's neck like a
     PERSONAL CHEERLEADER. Music blasts from the TV but doesn't
     drown out the hoots and banter of the rollicking entourage.
     There is a knock at the door.65.LAURAYou'll get that for me?

One of the friends breaks away from the pack, opens the door
without greeting and walks away. Alike is left alone to
escort herself in. Laura hardly looks up as Alike stops at
the fringes of the pack.ALIKEWassup man.

A collective grumble of greeting goes up around the table
although no one addresses Alike directly. Laura slams the
table and raises her hands in triumph.LAURABoard, goddammit!! I told you!PIER GIRL #1Awww, we shoulda been done set you!

Laura slaps hands with her partner. The unlucky pair of
partners argue. The personal cheerleader kisses Laura on the
neck. Alike looks away.PERSONAL CHEERLEADERGood game, baby!LAURAWhat's good, Lee?ALIKEJust came to say wassup.LAURAWhatchu got, Ty?PIER GIRL #2Three, maybe four.LAURAWe goin' eight!!

Roars of disbelief from around the table. Alike is quickly
forgotten in the ruckus. Alike circles to Laura's side. The
personal cheerleader looks her up and down.ALIKECan I talk to you for a second?LAURANow I got to cut you!! Grab `em
          partner. We gonna run a Boston on
          that ass!(MORE)66.(to Alike)
               Yo, I'm busy right now.

     More raucous laughter from the table. Alike endures another
     few moments of card slapping, table pounding dejection before
     leaning into Laura's ear.ALIKEI really need to talk to you--LAURAI said later!

     Wide-eyed silence and scattered snickers around the table.
     Laura resumes her hand and the game banter cranks back up.
     Alike picks up her face and slips away.PIER GIRL #3Thought that was your girl?LAURAMind your business. Bam! That's
               what I thought!

     Laura slaps another card on the table and takes a deep swig
     of water.53   INT. ALIKE'S PARENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                        53Audrey lies awake in bed. The clock on the nightstand
     indicates a little past two in the morning. She looks at the
     sliver of light underneath the bedroom door, the sound of
     Arthur's key in the door breaks the silence. Arthur's voice
     in hushed tones. Audrey rolls over and faces the wall.54   INT. ALIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                 54Alike watches her father's footsteps break up the light
     beneath her door. She tosses off her blankets and springs
     into the hallway.ALIKE(loud whisper)
               Hey Dad!

     She is talking to empty air. She eases down the hallway
     toward the kitchen and the sound of his muffled voice.ALIKE (CONT'D)Dad?67.ARTHUR (O.S.)Come on now, you know that's not
               what I want. That's not what I'm
               saying. That's not--listen to me.
               Are you gonna listen to me?ALIKEMom?

     Alike stops short outside the kitchen door, confused.ARTHUR (O.S.)Lee? Hold on.55   INT. ALIKE'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS                           55Alike swings around the corner.ALIKEHuh?ARTHURNo, not you.

               Hey, I'll talk to you later,
               alright? My daughter's up.

     Arthur flips his cell phone shut and tucks it into his
     pocket. He fishes a beer out of the fridge.ALIKEWho was that?

     Arthur sips his beer and walks over to the kitchen table. A
     foil covered plate with a little pink sticky note waits.ARTHURWhat you doing up?ALIKEJust wanted to talk.

     Arthur crumples the sticky note and tosses it into the trash
     without reading it. He peels up one side of the foil, peeks
     at the food underneath, and launches it into the trash, too.ALIKE (CONT'D)Dad, the plate--don't trash the
               plate.

     Arthur strips off his dress shirt and tie and flings them
     into the living room.68.Alike rescues the plate from the garbage and carefully lays
it in the sink so it doesn't clatter.ALIKE (CONT'D)Aren't you hungry?ARTHURAte already.ALIKEYou ate at work?ARTHURNo, just grabbed some take out.ALIKEOh. Where?

Arthur explodes.ARTHURWhy you asking me all these goddamn
          questions, girl? What's wrong with
          you? You don't question me.ALIKESorry.

Alike starts to head back to her room.ARTHURHold up. I'm sorry, Alike come on
          back. Look-- I got patties...

Arthur tosses a greasy bag onto the table and pulls out a
chair for her.ALIKEBeef?ARTHURAnd chicken. C'mon.

Alike sits happily and the two munch in silence for awhile.ARTHURListen uh...Your momma's worried
          that uh...How's school? Straight
          A's?ALIKEProbably.69.ARTHURThat's right. Want a sip?

Arthur offers her the beer. Alike takes it to the head.ARTHURI said a sip. A sip!

Arthur snatches the beer from her. They laugh. Alike picks at
her patty, eating little pieces of crust.ARTHUR (CONT'D)What's on you your mind?ALIKENothin'.

Arthur snorts.ALIKE (CONT'D)What if--what if...say somebody
          liked you right?ARTHURThey like you? Or they like you,

          yet. But what if... so what if the
          person is kinda like a friend, but
          you know they like you more than
          that?ARTHURWell, I think that's the best way
          to start--as friends.ALIKEBut then what if...What if the
          person is --

Arthur scents the heavy news packed in Alike's expressive
pause and scrambles to intercept her at the pass.ARTHUR (CONT'D)What's his name? What grade is he
          in?(MORE)70.I'ma look his ass up in the system.
          Ha-ha! Wait `till your mama finds
          out. She'll be so goddamn happy.

Alike plays along, swallowing her disappointment.ALIKEYeah.

Arthur pushes back from the table and pulls a fresh police
uniform out the hall closet. He lays it across the back of
the couch and unzips his pants. Alike turns her back to give
him privacy.ARTHURSay uh--there's this new--uh
          women's club up there by the liquor
          store--have you--do you--you
          haven't heard anything about it,
          right?

Alike shakes her head no. Arthur tucks his undershirt into
his pants.ARTHUR (CONT'D)Called the Kitty Litter, the
          Catbox, something like that?ALIKENah, I never even heard of it.ARTHURGood. `Cause you know that's a
          uh...it's a rough neighborhood. You
          know that right? I had a case over
          there. You wanna be careful--stay
          away from that element. Just in
          case it ever comes up?ALIKEI'll be careful.ARTHURGood. I know you will.

Alike glances back at Arthur and sees that he's decent. She
scoots back around to face him. Arthur smooths his uniform
shirt into his pants.ALIKEDad, when you were on the phone
          earlier? It sounded like...I
          mean...I guess you're headed back
          to work, huh?71.ARTHURYep. Your mama still up?ALIKEProbably.ARTHURTell her I had to work.

     Arthur picks up his work tote and kisses Alike on the
     forehead.ARTHUR (CONT'D)Love you.56   INT. LAURA'S KITCHEN - MORNING                            56Laura jams a pillow into a t-shirt as a makeshift pillowcase
     as she escorts one of the pier girls to the couch. The pier
     girl looks slightly unkempt and is relieved to plop her
     knapsack on the floor. Laura tosses the pillow onto the
     couch.LAURAMy sister gets home at six so, you
               gotta be gone by then.PIER GIRL #2Good looking.LAURAThere's some lunchmeat in there
               too, help yourself.PIER GIRL #2`Preciate ya.

     Laura pulls up close to the kitchen table. The GED test prep
     book, now dog-eared and worn is on the table in front of her.

     She finds her place and copies notes and multiple choice
     answers into a spiral notebook. A stack of old Math and
     English textbooks are in a chair next to her and the room is
     peaceful and still save for the scratching of her pencil.57   INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - AFTERNOON                           57Alike spies on Bina stuffing books into her locker. She draws
     her breath and approaches.ALIKEHey.72.BINAHey.

A long awkward silence. Alike leans against the bank of
lockers, not daring to make eye contact.ALIKEI'm sorry about the other day.BINAIt's cool.

Bina pretends to rearrange books in her locker.ALIKE (CONT'D)Things have been crazy. But look,
          I'm sorry I bugged out. It's
          just...I didn't know that you...I

     Arthur rubs his chest in mock heart-attack.ARTHURI don't about that. You're shaky
               girl, you're shaky. Get us some
               chips and I'll think about it.

     Arthur hands Alike a five dollar bill and she bounces down
     out of the car.59   EXT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS                               59Arthur shouts a greeting to Mack who lounges on a plastic
     chair outside his door. Sock and TWO OTHER MEN chit chat
     nearby. Their chatter lowers as Arthur approaches. Alike bops
     into the store.MACKHey, baby!ALIKEHey Mr. Ferguson!MACKI see Alike's been running circles
               around you again!ARTHURLittle bit, little bit. I still got
               it though.


     Arthur claps Mack on the shoulder and glimpses Sock
     whispering to one of the men.74.Arthur follows the men's gazes over to Alike at the potato
     chip rack. She twirls the string of her basketball shorts
     round and round her finger and idly hikes the collar of her t-
     shirt up over her nose. The smile evaporates from Arthur's
     face.


     Sock peers back at him, smirking. Arthur starts toward him,
     when Alike saunters out between them.ARTHURWe better get going.MACK (CONT'D)Gone already?ARTHURI'll holler at you later.

     Arthur crosses the lot in a bound, snatches the car keys from
     Alike's hand, and hustles her into the car.ARTHUR (CONT'D)Get in the car.ALIKEBut you said I could drive--ARTHURI said get in the car!

     Alike frowns, then catches sight of the men in front of the
     store. She slumps into the car and slams the door. Arthur
     piles into the driver's seat. They sit in silence for a
     moment, Alike traces the lines in her hands.60   INT. ARTHUR'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                               60ARTHURLook...umm...you know you're
               daddy's girl, right?

     Alike avoids eye contact, staring out her window. Arthur
     searches her face a moment longer, then starts the car and
     pulls away in silence.61   INT. ALIKE'S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                   61Audrey reclines on the couch reading a book. The doorknob
     jiggles and Audrey folds the book against her chest,
     pretending to be asleep.75.Arthur slips in and lays his holster on an armchair, not even
bothering to approach Audrey's sleeping form.

Arthur peeks inside the fridge and inspects one of Audrey's
foil covered plates. He tosses it aside and gathers sandwich
ingredients instead. Audrey yawns and props herself up on one
elbow.AUDREYOh you're home?ARTHURHey.AUDREYI must've dozed off. How long have
          you been in?ARTHURHour.

Dad takes a bite of his sandwich and shoves the ingredients
back into the fridge.AUDREYDid you see the plate in there?ARTHURThis is fine.

Arthur plops down on an armchair and flips the TV channel to
sports highlights. Mom scoots over on the couch.AUDREYThere's room over here. You can see
          the TV better.ARTHURThis is fine.

Arthur props his feet up on the coffee table and catches
Audrey's hurt expression. He winks at her.ARTHUR (CONT'D)Thank you.AUDREYJust alike.ARTHURSay what?76.AUDREYYou and your daughter. Have you
          talked to Lee yet? I told you she--ARTHURI talked to Alike.AUDREYYou did?ARTHUREverything's fine. Like I told you.
          Matter fact, she's got a boyfriend.AUDREYBoyfriend?ARTHURJust give her some space.AUDREYSpace? She's hardly ever home in
          the first place and you're just
          like her, creeping in all hours of
          the night. Both of you. Running
          around like you got something to
          hide, like I'm the big, bad witch
          and what about me? I'm home by
          myself all the time and Sharonda's
          getting older and starting to go
          out and pretty soon--ARTHURI don't have anything to hide. Look
          I told you I talked to Alike and
          everything is fine.AUDREYDid you ask her?

Dad slams down his half-eaten sandwich and stands up.ARTHURNo, because I didn't have to.
          Besides,I would know okay? If
          anybody would know, it would be me.
          I know my daughter--AUDREYYour daughter?!!ARTHUR--better than anyone else and--77.AUDREYSo now all of a sudden she's just
               your daughter?!ARTHUR                          AUDREY--I'm telling you she's just    Well I guess I better not
     fine!!                          have nothing else to say
                                     then, huh?!ARTHURThat's your damn problem, you're
               too much of a damn worry wart.AUDREYLet's hope you're right, Detective.ARTHURWill you shut the fuck up?!

     Audrey jerks to her feet and flings the book aside.AUDREYAn hour? Really? I'm not your dumb
               damn floozy in the street. And you
               will not talk to me that way.

     Audrey slaps the sandwich off Arthur's plate and storms to
     the bedroom. Arthur sees Sharonda peeking from her bedroom
     door but can't summon any words. Sharonda skitters into
     Alike's bedroom.62   INT. ALIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                 62Alike is awake, hands folded behind her head. Sharonda curls
     up on top of the covers next to her.ALIKEI know you're not scared.SHARONDAI'm not.

     The girls lay silently as they listen to Arthur bang around
     in the kitchen.SHARONDA (CONT'D)Lee?ALIKEHmm?78.SHARONDAI hope you know it doesn't matter
                to me.

     Alike rubs Sharonda's head and gives her a little squeeze.ALIKEI know.63   INT. HOUSE PARTY/POETRY SLAM - NIGHT                         63A MOHAWKED WOMAN yowls into a microphone atop a coffee table
     turned stage. Kids roam from room to room nursing plastic
     cups. Some in elaborate ensembles, some in thrift store duds,
     others in plain old jeans, but no two people the same. Alike
     clad in simple shirt and jeans looks especially comfortable
     as she and Bina ease their way through the crowd. In between
     performers, guitar riffs rock the large loft apartment and
     render their voices practically inaudible.MONTAGE:--Bina introduces Alike to different people, Alike is
     welcomed

     --Alike & Bina point out different performers, they laugh and
     talk in each other's ears

     --Alike and Bina dance wildly in the middle of the crowd,
     surrounded by dozens of other clamorous bodies

     --One performer beckons Alike up onto the table, Alike demurs
     at first, then leaps on top of the table. Bina cheers.

     --Alike drags a giggling Bina out of the party and they crash
     into the open night64   EXT. THE PIERS - NIGHT                                       64Lights glisten across the Hudson River--distant orbs
     reflected in a thousand shimmering faux stars in weak
     defiance against the night sky. A sodium vapor glow veils
     everything in generous haloes, making the night more
     beautiful than it really is.

     Dancing silhouettes, laughing, playing, yelling, flying,
     always dancing silhouettes punctuate the summer breeze with
     clapping set to the rhythm of soulful house. Like Puck on a
     midsummer's night, like Peter Pan and his lost boys. Among
     the silhouettes is Laura, enthroned atop a railing. Laura,
     smoking a joint grandly, surrounded by an adoring circle, a
     sycophantic harem of four.79.Laura, completely miserable as she watches two other
     silhouettes drawing closer, spinning, collapsing, now
     righting, always connected. Alike and Bina. Bina smiles and
     snakes her arms around Alike's neck. Alike too shy to react,
     giggles and folds. Laura watches the pair spin and passes to
     the left before stalking off toward the connected shadows.65   EXT. THE PIERS- CONTINUOUS                                65Laura cuffs Alike on the neck, pulling Alike's hoodie up over
     her face. Alike's laugh is tentative at first, not sure
     whether this is play or for real. Laura chuckles, breaking
     the ice. The pair slapbox and rough house, both missing with
     wild arcing blows. Laura aims a mini charge at Alike that
     lifts her off the ground and deposits her a short distance
     away. Alike swipes Laura's hat. Laura claps Alike on the
     shoulder and Alike waves to Bina. Bina waves and smiles.ALIKESo whatchu you think? She's cool
               right?

     Laura looks around and shrugs. Laura plucks a fresh joint out
     of her coat and lights it.ALIKE (CONT'D)She's hot right? I told you. It was
               so tight. I'm tellin' you, you
               shoulda been there tonight!

     Laura takes a puff and offers it to Alike.LAURAThis one's just for me and you.

     Alike waves it off, oblivious and intoxicated with the night.ALIKEAnd she's smart, too. She does
               poetry, you should hear it. It's
               like, it's good, you know?

     Laura stops walking and Alike skips ahead, still chattering.ALIKE (CONT'D)I was thinking next weekend the
               three of us could--LAURALook, I'm right here.

     Alike snaps out of it.80.ALIKE (CONT'D)Oh my bad, I thought you were
          beside me. Anyway, I was thinking--LAURALook, I'm sorry for all the drama.ALIKENo, it's cool. I shoulda--LAURAWhat I'm saying is, I probably
          overreacted.
              (beat)
          And then...I don't know. Seeing you
          two together or whatever. I'm glad
          to see you're finally happy.ALIKEC'mon man, you know you're my best
          friend. Nobody's gonna --LAURAYou don't need to say anything. I
          just wanted to get it off my chest.
          I'm happy for you, that's all.

Alike shakes her head. Her mouth moves but nothing comes out.LAURA (CONT'D)Because I love you, alright? And
          I'm sayin'...I'm right here.

Alike is stopped cold, as the light bulb finally goes off.
Laura takes a long drag on the joint. Bina and Mika stumble
over giggling. Bina hooks Alike's arm. Mika kisses Laura on
the neck. Laura snaps out of her gaze, her familiar smirk
creeping back.MIKAWe goin' to get something to eat?LAURAThat's what's up.ALIKEListen, umm--

Laura pinches out the joint and hands it to Mika who tucks it
away.LAURAThat's for later. Bina, nice to
          meet you.81.BINAYou too. We had fun.

     Laura gives Bina a polite hug, pounds Alike on the shoulder
     and starts to lead Mika away.MIKA                                 ALIKEByyeee!!                           Hey hold up!

     Laura pumps a lazy    fist in the air in acknowledgement. Bina
     takes Alike's hand    and slowly drags her away. Alike keeps
     looking back, then    finally gives up. Laura looks back just as
     Alike turns around    and disappears around the corner.BINA (CONT'D)I like your friends. They're cool.66   INT. BINA'S BEDROOM - LATER                                  66Music videos play on the TV. Alike and Bina lay stretched out
     on pillows, a plate of brownie crumbs between them. Alike
     dozes. Bina smacks her with a pillow.ALIKEI'm not sleep.BINAYes you are.

     Alike rubs sleep out of her eyes and props herself up on one
     elbow.ALIKEAny brownies left?BINANope.

     Bina flicks off the TV and stares at Alike.ALIKEWhat?BINANothing.

     Alike looks away.BINA (CONT'D)What?ALIKENothing.82.Alike folds her arms behind her head. Bina strokes Alike's
     stomach. Her finger's dance at the top of Alike's pajama
     bottoms. Their eyes meet. Alike sits bolt upright.BINAWhat're you doing? What's wrong?ALIKEThis is uh... I never... I'm sorry,
               I'm trippin' out.BINAIt's okay. We don't have to.

     Alike leans in and kisses Bina on the lips. Bina considers
     and takes Alike's chin in her hand and kisses her back. Bina
     places Alike's hand on her chest. Alike lets her hand linger,
     then traces Bina's shoulders.67   INT. LAURA'S KITCHEN - MORNING                               67Laura stands over the kitchen table shuffling through the
     mail. She pauses at a stiff envelope with her name on it. The
     return address reads "NYS Educational & Testing Services".
     She flips the envelope over and looks around, she rips the
     top off and eases the top of a slip out of the envelope. The
     top of the slip reads "'Campbell, Laura' GED TESTINGRESULTS."68   EXT. BRONX HOME - MORNING                                    68Laura shifts her weight on a painted concrete porch outside a
     small wooden frame home. The paint is peeling and the flowers
     in the window-box are dead. A rusted metal mailbox next to
     the door overflows with circulars. Laura lifts the circulars
     out of the box and trashes them. She picks up a discarded
     fast food bag and tosses it too. A dog barks from a
     neighboring yard. Laura pulls open the screen door and tries
     to peer in through the diamond shaped window in the main
     door, but it's covered over in aluminum foil. More barking.
     Laura surveys the street and bangs hard on the door. She
     snaps the screen door back and takes a big step backward.
     Laura shifts her weight and smooths her shirt. LAURA'S
     MOTHER, 54, and no-nonsense opens the door and frowns down at
     Laura through the screen.LAURAOh.

     Laura's mother crosses her arms and looks at Laura up and
     down.83.LAURA (CONT'D)Thought you might've stepped out or
          something? How've you been?

Laura's mother frowns up and down the block before refocusing
on Laura. Laura takes a step closer to the door.LAURA (CONT'D)Me and Candy, you know we're doing
          real good.

Laura's mother puts her hand on the doorknob.LAURA (CONT'D)We might even be moving to a bigger
          place soon. You know she's workin'
          at the hospital now, yeah you'd be
          real proud of her. She might even
          go back and get her RN--

Laura takes another step forward.LAURA (CONT'D)How--? How's Pops? You look good.
          You look healthy, yeah you look
          real good. You know uh, we miss you
          and everything--

Laura's mother starts to close the door. Laura backs away.LAURA (CONT'D)I don't wanna take too much of your
          time. I just stopped by--you know I
          uh--I'm getting my stuff together
          too--I uh--

Laura fishes the stiff envelope out of her pocket and
advances on the screen door again, holding it out.LAURA (CONT'D)So, I did it. I took the test and--

Laura's mother slams the door. Laura stands on her tiptoes
and yells at the diamond shaped window.LAURA (CONT'D)I got my GED!

The lock on the door snaps into place. Renewed barking from
across the street. Silence from the door. Laura brushes a
fist across her eyes and stuffs the envelope into the
mailbox.84.LAURA (CONT'D)But listen I--I gotta go. I gotta
               get to work but I'ma leave it for
               you to see. It was nice talking to
               you.

     Laura backs off the porch and starts down the walkway. She
     stops halfway and bounds back onto the porch. She yanks the
     envelope out of the mailbox and jams it into her pocket.
     Laura storms off the porch and out of yard, never looking
     back.69   INT. BINA'S BEDROOM - MORNING                                69Alike is asleep on the bed. Bina cleans up feverishly,
     "accidentally" bumping Alike awake. Alike yawns and rolls
     over, a huge grin spreading across her face as she remembers
     her surroundings.ALIKEHey.BINAHey.

     Bina bolts to the dresser and crams clothes in.ALIKEYou up already?BINAIt's after one o'clock, actually.

     Bina deposits an armful of clothes into the dirty clothes
     hamper, and then begins making the bed with Alike still in
     it. Alike pulls Bina down beside her.ALIKEWhat's wrong?BINANothin's wrong, I'm just cleaning
               up. Don't worry about it.ALIKEOkay then, I'll help you.BINANo, I got it.

     Bina snatches a pillow from behind Alike and fluffs it.
     Alike, still oblivious, grins and traces Bina's shoulder.85.ALIKELook um--I just wanted to say that
          last night...last night was
          amazing...thank you for--BINALast night we were just playin'
          around, that's all.

Bina flinches away from Alike's touch. Alike shoots a glance
at the door and drops her voice to a choked whisper.ALIKELook... We can slow things down...
          Nobody has to know that we're
          together.BINA"Together"? Whoa, no...ALIKEHuh?! I thought... Look if you
          don't want to call it that, that's
          fine, but don't act like nothing
          happened.

Bina moves away and levels her gaze at Alike for the first
time. Alike touches Bina's elbow, Bina flinches away.BINALook, I'm not gay okay? This isn't
          me--I wasn't--I'm not ready for all
          this...

Alike recruits the discarded stuffed moose and dances it
around on the bed. Bina recoils and snatches it away.
Recognition seeps across Alike's pained face. Bina moves away
from the bed and turns her back on Alike.

Alike finds her pajama pants on the floor and yanks them on.
She pulls on jeans over her pajama bottoms and hauls a
sweatshirt down over her nightie. She flings her backpack
open on the bed and hunts around the room wildly gathering
her things. Alike goes in the bathroom and reappears with an
armful of toiletries, dumping them in the bag. Bina watches
her, arms folded. Alike takes one last look around the room
and heads for the door, running a sleeve across her face.BINA (CONT'D)Lee?

Alike ignores her and launches into the hallway.   Bina runs
to her bedroom doorway.86.BINA (CONT'D)Wait--Lee?!

     Alike beelines for the front door. Bina chases Alike across
     the room.BINA (CONT'D)Lee, stop please?

     Alike wipes a sleeve across her swelling eyes and running
     nose and turns to face her. Bina takes several steps toward
     her. Alike lets go of the doorhandle, her voice cracks.ALIKEWhat?BINAYou promise you won't tell anybody?70   EXT. BINA'S HOUSE/STREET - DAY                            70Alike rages outside, weaving blind fury down the sidewalk.
     She kicks over a cluster of garbage cans and cyclones out
     into the street, narrowly missing getting hit by a car. She
     continues her zag to the other sidewalk, her pace quickening.
     She rips open her backpack and launches a baseball cap into
     the air. She tears a handful of wifebeaters from the bag and
     flings them into the street. Spinning and thrashing she
     wrenches out a football jersey and jams it into another
     garbage can. She circles back and kicks the can over. She
     hurtles her backpack into the trees like a discus and sheds
     her hoodie like a skin before disappearing into the scream of
     a subway station.71   INT. ALIKE'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING                        71Lee bursts into the living room and charges to her bedroom.
     Audrey, who has been waiting in the living room storms in
     after her.AUDREYWhere in the hell have you been?!

     Alike kicks off her shoes and paces the room.AUDREY (CONT'D)You hear me talking to you ?! Where
               you been? You left Bina's hours
               ago!!!! Lee--ALIKEI'M NOT YOUR HUSBAND!!!!87.Audrey gasps in stunned silence.ALIKE (CONT'D)I'm not your husband so stop comin'
               at me like I am. I'm not your
               companion, I'm not your friend --
               you made that abundantly clear--I'm
               your daughter and I have my own
               shit to deal with!!AUDREYLEE--don't you dare--Alike--I am
               your Mother--

     Audrey melts back against the doorjamb. Alike slings off her
     shirt and slams the door in Audrey's face. A livid Audrey
     bangs on the door and jiggles the handle.AUDREY (CONT'D)You must have lost your damn mind!
               Wait until your father gets home!72   INT. ALIKE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS                         72Alike attacks her closet, ripping all the "girly" shirts from
     the hangers and hurling them toward a small vanity trashcan.
     She plunges back in and slams an armful of blouses to the
     floor. She launches a pair of pumps into the wall, followed
     by a chunky pair of Timberlands. Silent sobs rack her body as
     she tears off her own shirt and slings it at the mirror. She
     strips off her jeans and kicks them brutally into a corner.
     Alike considers her unclothed form in the mirror before
     collapsing onto the bed. She writhes against the pillows and
     covers her eyes with her elbow as darts of grief twist
     through her body. Blackout.73   INT. ALIKE'S BEDROOM - LATER                              73Alike jerks awake in her bed, a pillow pulled down around her
     ears. The sound of a muffled argument leaks from her
     parents's bedroom. The shouting gets louder, and Alike sits
     upright in her bed as her father's footsteps boom past her
     doorway and into the living room. Audrey's voice trails him
     down the hallway, and Alike scrambles into a t-shirt and
     shorts.74   INT. ALIKE'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING                        74Arthur's hand is on the doorknob, a small tote flung over his
     shoulder. Audrey blocks the door, her hands on her hips. They
     both look up as Alike edges into the living room.88.AUDREYYou see, that's exactly what I'm
          talking about?! Get over here!ARTHURGo back to bed!AUDREYNo, you come tell your father what

          father leaving us!!ARTHURI'm not fucking leaving!! Will you
          stop saying that?!AUDREYCome say goodbyeeee!!

Audrey shoves Arthur toward the door. Reflexively, Arthur
raises his hand at Audrey. Audrey puffs up.AUDREY (CONT'D)Oh, what?! I wish you would!! Go
          ahead!! Look girls, your daddy's
          going to beat me!!

Sharonda bursts into tears behind Alike. Alike hurries
Sharonda back down the hallway.89.ALIKEShhh. It's okay. Go in my room and
               lock the door. Don't come out,
               `kay?

     Sharonda bawls harder. Alike gently closes the door on her.ALIKE (CONT'D)It's gonna be okay.75   INT. ALIKE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS                     75Arthur and Audrey argue viciously.ARTHUR (O.S.)No! Dammit, that's not true! Look,
               will you stop sayin' that?!AUDREY (O.S.)It's the truth!!

     Alike edges back into the living room, Audrey wheels on her.
     Arthur is beaten and cornered.AUDREY (CONT'D)Your daddy's got a new girlfriend!
               Or did you already know that?! You
               know, I bet you did!!ARTHURAudrey, stop it!! Alike go back to

               into a damn man right before your
               very eyes, and you can't even see
               it!!

     Arthur drops his tote and advances toward Audrey, leveling a
     stiff finger at her face.ARTHURNo you take that back.! You shut
               the fuck up about that, Audrey!

     Arthur gets in Audrey's face. Audrey leers back at him. Alike
     jumps between them.ALIKEDad?! Stop!90.ARTHURGo back to bed, Alike!!AUDREYTell him, Lee!ARTHURDon't call her Lee!ALIKEMom, stoppit please!?AUDREYTell your Dad where you hang out!

          about?! You don't know what the
          hell are you talking about. Alike,
          please just go to your room, baby!

Alike drops her gaze and backs away.AUDREYTell him!

Arthur's expression cracks and he tears his focus from Audrey
to Alike.ARTHURTell me what?!ALIKEI'm not tellin' you nothin'.AUDREYTell him you're a dyke! You tell
          him you're a nasty ass dyke!!ARTHURNo she's not gay. Alike we didn't
          raise you that way, baby.

Eyes still downcast, Alike just shakes her head and backs
away.AUDREYThere!! You see!!91.ARTHURYou shut the hell up Audrey!!

Arthur extends his arms toward Alike, his voice trembling.ARTHUR (CONT'D)I know that's not true. You tell
          your mother right now, Alike. You
          tell her it isn't true!!

Alike meets her father's eyes.ALIKEDad--ARTHURDon't you lie now, you tell the
          truth!!ALIKEYou already know.ARTHURNo, I don't know. You tell your
          mother it's just a phase.ALIKEIt's not a phase!

Arthur is stopped cold, his shoulders slump.AUDREYSee, if you would've DONESOMETHING!!ARTHUR(to Alike)
          What's wrong with you?ALIKEThere's nothing wrong with me!AUDREYThis is your fault!! If you had--

Arthur tears into Audrey, spittle flying.ARTHURAUDREY WILL YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!92.AUDREY                          ARTHURDON'T YOU SCREAM AT ME!! You    This is NOT my fault!! Just

often!! Why don't you DO        trying to fuckin' talk--SOMETHING!!!ALIKEYEAH I'M GAY!!Arthur spasms as though he's been stabbed. Out of nowhere,
Audrey's backhand pistons Alike to the ground. She raises her
hand high and slaps it down hard on Alike's shoulders and
arms. Alike yells. Arthur turns to stone.AUDREYSay it again! Say it again!

Alike fends off Audrey's blows with her hands. She kicks
angrily as Audrey towers over her.ALIKEI'm a lesbian! Yeah, I'm a dyke.AUDREYNo you're not!!!!!

Audrey's blows become more manic and vicious. Arthur wakes
from his trance and tries to wrestle Audrey off of Alike.ARTHURThat's enough! Stop it!AUDREYDon't you say that! Let go! Don't
          you say that!ALIKEGet offa me!!AUDREYWhat? You a man now? YOU GON' FIGHTME LIKE A MAN??!!Audrey swings and hits Alike with a nasty hook to the jaw,
Alike's head snaps back and hits the floor.ARTHURAUDREY STOP!!!!Arthur yanks Audrey off of Alike. Audrey directs her rage at
him, pummeling his face and chest.93.AUDREYAND YOU TOO! YOU TOO! YOU TOO! OHGOD!!Tears stream down Arthur's face as Audrey shakes free and
     aims one last blow at his face.AUDREY (CONT'D)YOU SAY IT'S NOT TRUE!!!76   INT. LAURA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                              76Click-clack. Click-clack. The rattle of circuit breakers echo
     through the bare darkness of Laura's small apartment.LAURAAnything?ALIKENo.

     Click-clack. Click-clack.LAURAHow about now?ALIKENo. Nothing.LAURAShit. Fucking building.

     Laura bangs into something in the darkness.LAURA (CONT'D)Owww. Shit!

     A small light flicks to life and grows larger. In its dim
     glow, Laura spots Alike leaning against a worn couch. The
     lights become two as Laura hands Alike a candle.LAURAHere. Good thing I keep some these
               around.

     Alike snorts thickly. Her words are slurred and nasal.ALIKEYeah, for your many women.LAURAHey, you thanking `em now.94.Laura holds her candle up to Alike's grim face.LAURAYou okay?

     Alike wipes at already dried tear streaks on her puffy face
     and looks down. Laura slides an arm around her waist and
     guides her into the small bedroom.LAURAYou bring clothes?ALIKEHuh-uh. I stopped by the house--I
               stopped by---LAURAThat's alright, man. You can wear
               some of mine. It's okay, c'mon.
               Lets get some sleep. My sister'll
               be home in a little bit, too.77   INT. LAURA'S BEDROOM - LATER                                 77Overturned Ramen noodle cups litter the floor. Laura sips a
     beer and strokes Alike's head who sleeps fitfully in her lap.78   INT. ALIKE'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING                           78Arthur is frozen in the middle of the living room with a
     contractor trash bag. He stoops and piles the shards of a
     broken lamp into the bag one by one. Sharonda peeks out at
     him from her bedroom door. Arthur looks up at her and
     Sharonda pushes the door shut.79   INT. ALIKE'S PARENT'S BEDROOM - DAY                          79Audrey sits at the edge of her bed in a housecoat. Her hair
     is ruffled and flyaway. Her ankles are crossed and her hands
     are dead birds in her lap. Her work clothes are laid out in a
     neat line beside her: shirt, pants, socks, and shoes on the
     floor right underneath. The telephone begins to ring, but
     Audrey does not hear it.80   INT. BINA'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON                              80Bina and a HIGH SCHOOL BOY sit on the floor, their backs
     propped against the bed, books spread on the floor. The boy
     puts his arm around Bina, launching numerous passionate
     advances, but Bina pushes him away.95.The clueless boy continues his clumsy attempts. Bina stares
     out the window, completely detached.81   INT. ALIKE'S KITCHEN - AFTERNOON                              81Audrey, still in her housecoat, stares into the refrigerator,
     transfixed by the mountain of foil-covered plates. Her eyes
     are cried-out buttons. Suddenly she remembers to breathe, and
     her breaths come raggedly tearing out fresh tears. She yanks
     a foil-covered plate, dumps its contents into the trash can
     and tosses the plate into the sink. She dumps another and
     another, her composure returning with each plate tossed. By
     the time she gets to the last one, her breathing slows and
     returns to normal. She disappears into the bedroom and
     reappears with the red shopping bag. She calmly lifts out the
     pink blouse and stuffs it into the garbage. She wads up the
     shopping bag and stuffs it in too. She takes a deep breath
     and wipes her sleeve across her nose.AUDREYOkay.82   INT. ALIKE'S KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON                         82Arthur, Audrey and Sharonda are pegged around the dinner
     table. Audrey's make-up fails to cover the dark circles
     beneath her eyes and Arthur has a week's worth of stubble.
     There is a jagged hole where Alike usually sits. Noticing
     the asymmetry, Audrey bundles up Alike's place setting and
     sweeps it onto the floor. Sharonda looks from Audrey to
     Arthur then into her plate.AUDREYYou want to say grace?

     Arthur clears his throat.ARTHURHeavenly Father...

     Audrey thrusts her hands out to Arthur and Sharonda.   They
     each take her hand and Arthur begins again.ARTHUR (CONT'D)Dear Heavenly Father we pray... we
               pray thank you for this food and we
               pray... we pray for your continued
               blessing...

     Arthur stops talking but his head remains bowed. An awkward
     silence ensues. Audrey and Sharonda look up at him still
     holding hands.96.AUDREYAmen!ARTHURAmen.

     Audrey switches to an overly cheery auto-pilot mode, babbling
     to no one in particular.AUDREYI got this recipe from a magazine.
               Supposed to be very good. And you
               see I made those green beans you
               like. Sharonda pass the rice
               please.

     Sharonda, staring at her father doesn't reach for the bowl.SHARONDADad. You know where she is.83   EXT. LAURA'S ROOFTOP - WEEKS LATER                         83Alike and Laura sit at the edge of the roof sharing a quart
     of mint chocolate chip ice cream. Sunset paints the cityscape
     pink and orange. The faint cadence of children playing drifts
     in and out on a fickle breeze. Alike's wounds are healing and
     she seems happy. The friends exchange wordless smiles and
     soak in the peacefulness around them.

     Laura hears a noise at the door and gets up to investigate.
     Arthur is standing in the doorway. Laura calls out to Alike.
     Alike looks up and the smile fades from her face. Arthur
     tries to move around Laura, but Laura stares him down. Laura
     looks back at Alike. Alike considers, then carefully nods.
     Laura steps out of the way and watches Arthur pass.

     Alike rises to face her father. She stands tall, her weight
     is centered. Arthur struggles to find her eyes, and she turns
     away from him. Distant playground voices fill the pause.EXT. LAURA'S ROOFTOP - WEEKS LATERAlike sits at the edge of the roof writing in her notebook.
     Laura swings open the door and Alike looks back in greeting,
     her smile fading as Arthur appears behind her. Laura motions
     to Alike. Alike considers, then carefully nods. Laura steps
     aside and watches Arthur pass.

     Alike wanders to the edge of the roof, Arthur follows.
     Distant playground voices fill the pause.97.ALIKEWhere's Mom?ARTHURShe...your mother couldn't make it.

Alike shakes her head and peers into the rusty skyline.
Arthur slumps his hands in his pockets and edges closer.ARTHUR (CONT'D)Remember our old place? Waaay out
          in Queens? It was our first
          apartment, we were so proud. Had
          all those trees around it? In
          October, the whooole block would be
          covered with leaves. You remember.

Alike makes no sign.ARTHUR (CONT'D)You couldnt've been more than 2
          years old. And when the wind would
          blow, all those leaves would come
          rushing down the street at us and
          you thought they were alive. You'd
          get so scared. You'd cry and you'd
          scream and beg for us to pick you
          up. I would try and tell you
          "they're only leaves, baby" and
          make you stay on the ground. But
          you were so afraid and you cried so
          hard, your mother would always pick
          you up. She always picked you up.

Arthur is silent beneath the weight of his memory. He dares a
glance over at Alike.ARTHUR (CONT'D)`Member how we used to--ALIKEI've been accepted into a early
          college program. Starts in the
          Spring. Berkeley.ARTHURCalifornia's a long way away--ALIKETen weeks writing boot camp,
          workshops. Then I can start summer
          semester.98.ARTHURWe can talk about that. Okay?ALIKEI need you to meet with my guidance
          counselor. Sign the paperwork so I
          can graduate early.ARTHURI'm sorry, alright? I'm sorry I let
          her hurt you--ALIKEI need to know now if you'll sign
          the papers. Yes or no?ARTHURCan you forgive me?ALIKEYes or no?ARTHURYou can always come back home.
          Things are gonna be different, I
          promise you--

Alike holds Arthur's hand, stopping him.ALIKEDad, I'm not running. I'm choosing.

Arthur's heart breaks, he gasps back a sob.ALIKE (CONT'D)I'm not going back home.ARTHURI know.
              (beat)
          Okay.

Alike nods, squeezes Arthur's hand. Arthur breathes deeply,
composing himself. He starts to pull away.ARTHUR (CONT'D)I better--ALIKETell Mom that she was right.ARTHURRight about what?99.ALIKEGod doesn't make mistakes.ARTHURYou should tell her yourself.

     Arthur squeezes Alike's hand and drifts away. Alike inhales
     the sunset.84   INT. HOSPITAL BREAK ROOM - AFTERNOON                         84Audrey is cleaned up, well-dressed and freshly put together.
     She sits alone at the lunch table, crunching an apple. A
     bible and a daily devotional guide are spread open in front
     of her. Alike knocks on the glass, and Audrey looks up
     stunned. Alike comes in and sits across from her. Audrey
     glances around, concerned about passing coworkers.ALIKEMom.AUDREYLee--Alike. How've you been?ALIKEFine. Did Dad tell you?AUDREYHe told me, yes.ALIKEHow are you?

     Audrey gathers her lunch garbage and pushes back from the
     table.AUDREYI just hope you're keeping yourself
               safe.ALIKEI love you, Mom.

     Audrey stacks her devotional guide on top of her bible and
     stands. She starts to speak, then crosses to the door
     instead.ALIKE (CONT'D)I said I love you.AUDREYI'll be praying for you.100.Audrey disappears into the hallway.84A   EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY                                         84AAlike writes in her notebook, mouthing the words to a poem.

     as Arthur and Alike ride in complete silence. Sharonda chews
     a thumbnail, peering over the backseat. Laura slumps against
     the window, a smirk hiding at the corner of her lips.86   EXT. REGIONAL BUS STOP - DAY                                 86Laura and Sharonda fumble a suitcase out of the trunk of the

     and hefts out the rest of the luggage.ARTHURI got it.

     Arthur slams the trunk shut.ALIKEThank you.ARTHURYou want me to come in with you?

     Alike shakes her head. Arthur starts to back away.ARTHURWell--

     out of her pocket to wrap both arms around her friend.102.SHARONDACall us when you get there.ALIKEYou know I will.

     Laura backs away and wipes a sleeve at her eye.LAURAYou just better fuckin' call.

     Alike disappears through the bus doors. Laura slouches on a
     hydrant and Sharonda paces, scanning the windows for Alike.88   INT. BUS - DAY                                              88Sharonda waves maniacally. Alike musters a smile and puts a
     hand on the window. Laura raises a fist. The bus sails away
     from the curb.

     Alike leans forward to keep Laura and Sharonda in sight as
     long as possible. As she faces front again, she glimpses
     Arthur, standing in the doorway of the terminal. A passing
     van blots him from view and she leans back in her seat. An
     OLD KOREAN WOMAN next to her offers her a piece of ginger
     candy. Alike pops the candy into her mouth and takes a deep
     breath.

     Reflections of the retreating city landscape replay across
     Alike's face and she is able to hold back neither the smile
     nor the tears that come.FADE TO BLACK.
