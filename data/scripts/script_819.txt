    unsnaps her seat belt and reaches for the door handle. The
    driver, JOHN, sees her door open and dives to GRAB her. The
    SUV spins, HORNS BLARE, TIRES SCREECH, cars swerve to avoid
    collision. We aren't sure what is happening, but we know
    something has gone terribly wrong. Cut to BLACK. Read:THE LAST THREE YEARS2   INT. STEAK HOUSE -- NIGHT                                       2Two couples sit at a table, picking at dessert, JOHN and
    LARA BRENNAN on one side, MICK and ERIT on the other. JOHN           
    is attractive in a worn kind of way, but has the eyes of a
    kid with a discipline problem. You have to really know him
    to understand if he is mocking you or agreeing with you. He
    is a master of irony and has a true enjoyment of the absurd.
    LARA looks beautiful even in her wrinkled suit. She appears
    to have had a hard day at the office. She's been drinking
    at dinner; it hasn't eased her nerves. John's good-looking
    brother, MICK, boasts his blue collar roots and a gorgeous,          
    if slightly trashy, girlfriend, ERIT, who isn't ashamed of
    her body or sharing her opinions. JOHN and MICK are laughing.        
    Lara puts cash on the tray beside Mick's credit card.LARAYou know what? If you were smart
               you would stop talking right now.ERITSue me. I just know that women should                     
               never work for women.

    John laughs and applauds.   Mick buries his head.LARAHow can you say that??ERITThey're always threatened. Especially
               if you're beautiful and they're not.LARAErit, you are so full of shit.ERITSo, your boss isn't threatened by
               you?(CONTINUED)2.2   CONTINUED:                                                       2LARABecause she's a bitch! --
                     (as John and Mick laugh)                             
                 --Not because she's a woman.ERITAnd you would describe her as
                 "attractive"?LARAThat has nothing to do with it!ERITAnd there is my answer.JOHNEither of you like another drink?

    Lara shoots John a burning look as Erit builds on her victory.ERITWomen should work under men, men
                 under women. That's it.JOHN(egging her on)
                 But men under men?ERITThat's fine, too.
                     (the men burst into laughter)
                 They're used to it! Why are you
                 laughing?MICK(re: Erit)
                 I don't know, bro, but I think I'd
                 rather work under you than her.ERIT(insulted, shoots back)
                 Oh please, I'd rather work under
                 him, too.

    That was a dig at Mick but Lara is primed for a fight.LARAYou'd rather "work under" John?ERITYou have a problem with that, too?(CONTINUED)3.2   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                   2LARANo, why would I have a problem with                         
                 your little sexual innuendo?ERITWhat is up your ass tonight??

    Mick throws John a "This is all your fault and now it is                 
    going to explode" look. John feigns complete innocence.LARASo, I shouldn't take offense that
                 you're coming on to my husband right                        
                 in front of me.ERIT(claws out now)
                 Lara, if I wanted your husband I
                 would have him.LARAHow? You couldn't possibly show him
                 more of your tits.

    The men are on their feet before blows are exchanged.ERIT-- You know what your problem is?!JOHN                             MICKThat was a great meal!           Okay--okay!3   EXT. STEAK HOUSE PARKING LOT -- NIGHT                               3Mick and Erit head toward Mick's sporty pickup.     John and             
    Lara step into foreground, Lara still fuming.JOHNShe is completely full of shit.LARADON'T try and agree with me now.JOHNYou know what? I don't even believe
                 she is in the dental profession.

    Lara knows this game; he is trying to get her out of her
    black mood, and she has no intention of letting him.LARAShut up.(CONTINUED)4.3   CONTINUED:                                                         3JOHNI bet she can't even spell
                 anesthesiologist. Woman's a complete
                 fraud.LARAWe went to her office party, idiot.JOHNI think she hit on me that night,
                 too.

    Lara opens the back door of their black Prius and tosses in
    the raincoat she was carrying. They climb in, under....LARAYou are completely delusional. She
                 wasn't even hitting on you in there;
                 I just don't like her.JOHNI understand. People who look like
                 that should not be allowed anywhere
                 near oral surgery.

    She feels a smile coming to her lips and tries to force it
    away.LARAYou are such an asshole.JOHNYou're in the chair trying to stay
                 calm; how are you supposed to do that
                 with those things hanging over your--

    She can't stand how attractive he is in this moment -- she
    stops him short by kissing him passionately. His hands slip
    under her blouse; she tugs at his sweater.JOHN (CONT'D)Someone's going to --

    Her hand goes to his pants. He yanks at the seat lever and
    it goes crashing back, Lara landing atop him.

    After a moment he sits up quickly and pushes down the visors.
    She laughs and kisses him and they disappear into each other.4   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - BACK DOOR -- NIGHT                            4Lara and John enter, Lara carrying her raincoat, her hair
    sticking up in the back, John's shirt untucked.(CONTINUED)WHITE    9-10-09                                                   5.4   CONTINUED:                                                              4LARAHello!

    JENNA, the teenage baby-sitter, sees right through them.LARA (CONT'D)Did he cry?JENNAOnly when I dropped him down the                                
                 stairs.                                                         

    Lara shoots her a look, hangs up her coat and exits upstairs.5   INT.

BRENNAN HOUSE - FOYER                                              6Lara comes down to find John paying Jenna. John nods for
    her to check the mirror. She tugs at the knot in her hair.JOHNThanks.   See you next weekend.

    Jenna exits. Lara shows him that his sweater is inside out.
    John reacts: "Oh God." Lara's smile broadens; she kisses
    him. He pins her to the wall and they start all over again.
    He feels for the light switch. He finds it; we cut to BLACK.7   INT. JOHN AND LARA'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT                                   7Lara wakes, troubled.      It's the middle of the night.8   INT. LUKE'S ROOM -- NIGHT                                               8Lara finds Luke's window closed but unlocked. She locks it
    and looks out. Satisfied, she sits and watches her son sleep.9   INT.    KITCHEN -- MORNING                                              9Three year-old LUKE holds a knife and fork as he sits at the
    table watching his dad cut up his pancakes.JOHNOkay, your turn.

                     (to Lara)
                 Your son is hopeless.

    Lara grabs her phone and leans over them to take a photo.LARASqueeze in tight.JOHNYou can't do this every morning.   It
                 is way too corny.LARASmile.   It's just until he's eighteen.

    It flashes. Lara kisses John, puts an alien-looking electric
    toothbrush on the table & walks off to pour coffee to go.LARA (CONT'D)Present.JOHN(examining it)
                 Sweetie, you have to stop believing
                 everything you read in a catalogue.LARAYou hate brushing your teeth; this
                 one brushes them in thirty seconds.JOHN(as if stung)
                 I love brushing my teeth.

                 Can you pick up Luke?LARAAfter yesterday I probably don't
                 have a job anyway. Do you think it
                 was wrong to call her a useless cow?(CONTINUED)7.9    CONTINUED:    (2)                                               9JOHNBosses admire that kind of frank

                  card.LARAYou're completely impossible.JOHN (O.S.)Did you notice what I got for my

                  Remember this for the custody hearing:
                  how Mommy is always scolding Daddy.LARAHow are you going to feel if Luke
                  grows up and doesn't call you?

     Lara can't keep a straight face and heads to the foyer.(CONTINUED)8.11   CONTINUED:                                                        11JOHNNow she's driving a wedge between us.LARAI give up.JOHNAnd now she is abandoning you.

     Lara grabs her raincoat and notices a stain on the back
     shoulder. Irritated, she heads back to the bathroom.12   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM                          12Lara rinses the stain under the sink, surprised to see it
     run red. She looks at her hands: blood. The doorbell rings.13   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - KITCHEN                                      13John rises to answer the door.14   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM                          14Lara looks at her coat, wonders how the hell she got blood
     on her shoulder. She rubs liquid soap into it.15   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FOYER                                        15As John opens the door, DETECTIVE QUINN shows his badge.
     DETECTIVE COLLERO and a team of detectives push past. John
     has no time to react.DETECTIVE QUINNPolice.   Mr. Brennan?

     LUKE sees the police rush past him and gets scared.DETECTIVE QUINN (CONT'D)My name is Detective Quinn. This is
                  a search warrant for these premises.

     She sees the coat with the water spot; nods to a team member,
     who takes it and bags it under:DETECTIVE COLLEROLara Brennan?LARAWHAT?!DETECTIVE COLLEROLara Brennan, you are under arrest
                for the murder of Elizabeth Gesas.

     The uniform pushes him up against the wall and cuffs his
     wrists. John watches as his child cries, his wife is led
     out in handcuffs and the house is torn apart. Cut to BLACK.18   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- NIGHT                                         18LUKE (O.S.)Daddy!...    DADDY!!

     A light comes on.   John steps out of his bedroom and enters
     his son's room.JOHN (O.S.)It's okay.     Just a bad dream.

     He comes back out carrying Luke, now SIX YEARS-OLD.10.19   INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT                                     19John lays Luke on the bed and climbs in beside him.JOHNYou okay?

     Luke nods.JOHN (CONT'D)Okay, you can sleep here as long as
                  you stay on this side of the bed.

     Luke immediately scrambles over his father to take his side.JOHN (CONT'D)You're such a snake, I don't know why
                  I keep falling for the same trick.

     John kisses Luke, who closes his eyes and snuggles his pillow.

     John reaches for the lamp. Beside it sits the framed photo
     that Lara snapped of the three of them that fateful morning.
     He switches off the lamp, and the screen goes BLACK.20   EXT. PITTSBURGH -- DAY                                           20The "T," the city's fast-moving trolley, rises up from

He glances over
     at the pleasant and colorful play area in the corner and
     sees children playing. Luke plays by himself.

     - John puts his key ring in a plastic container. The guard
     takes it and puts the keys with other visitors' belongings.
     John guides his son toward the metal detector. Luke walks
     through and the buzzer goes off.

     John instinctively moves forward to help. A guard stops him
     with a hand on his chest. On the other side of the metal
     detector another guard runs a wand over Luke, pulls something
     from his pocket, looks at it curiously.JOHNIt's a toy!

     The guard runs the wand over the child again; no screech.
     The guard waves John through. No beep. John kneels and
     pulls on Luke's jacket.JOHN (CONT'D)Don't worry.     We'll get it back.23   INT.

COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- DAY                      24John stares out the window at the city beyond.    Life seems
     so close.

     He looks back into the large communal visiting room; a dozen
     round tables and plastic chairs. The concrete block walls
     are covered with naive paintings in bright colors and messages
     of hope. Luke plays at his feet with a basket of Legos.

     The door at the far side buzzes, a guard opens it and
     prisoners in red jump-suits marked VISITING ROOM enter.

     Lara enters and looks around. She is pale, thin and her
     hair has returned to its natural color. Lara hurries to him
     and gives him a real kiss. She breaks and steps to Luke,
     who plays with his back to her.LARAHi honey. Can Mommy get a kiss?
                    (no response. Tickles him)

     He gives her a peck on the cheek and goes back to his Legos.LARAIs Daddy reading you my letters?JOHNEvery night at bedtime.LARAWhat are you building?    A fort?

     Lara pulls him into a hug; no response. She kisses his head

     suits and hand them to a female guard, who searches them for
     contraband. Lara retrieves her regular jump-suit and pulls
     it on over her underwear. Another small, daily humiliation.27   INT. JOHN'S BATHROOM -- NIGHT                                   27Start VERY CLOSE ON JOHN'S DIGITAL WATCH. Widen to see Luke

     toilet, staring at his watch.JOHNTwenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty.

     Luke nods.28   EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - GARAGE AND ALLEY -- MORNING                28The garage door opens; the Prius has a lot more miles on it.

     over his face. He watches Luke play with a girl his age.JOHNLuke!   Let's go, Toad.   Come on.

     Luke runs to him. John pulls Luke's jacket on. He doesn't
     notice the young mother on the next bench, NICOLE, watching
     him admiringly. She calls to the girl Luke was playing with.NICOLETime to go, Carrie!

     John glances in time to see CARRIE plop down in the sand,
     arms folded. He shares a sympathetic smile with Nicole, who
     heads to retrieve her daughter. John walks off with Luke.30   INT. CRIMINAL COURTHOUSE -- DAY                                    30John waits as a courtroom lets out. MEYER FISK steps out

     door opens, and Lara steps up on the other side. John smiles
     and picks up the phone, but Lara sees something in his face
     and doesn't pick up her phone, just stares at him.

     John fights to keep his smile and nods for her to pick up
     her phone -- but now she can see the verdict chiseled on his
     face. Lara gasps and cries inconsolably.

     John keeps the smile plastered on his face, but now tears
     run down his cheeks. He taps on the glass and points at her
     phone, but she doesn't respond. He taps harder and harder --
     desperately wanting to comfort her, but she won't allow it.

     He bangs on the glass with his fist, drawing the attention
     of the guard on his side.

     Lara turns and exits. John stands and yells her name, but
     she can't hear it, and neither can we.33   EXT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- DAY                                33We're in an old working class neighborhood.    John sits in

     his wife, who's attached to an I.V. and monitors, pale and
     weak, her arm bandaged where she cut it open along the artery.

     Lara opens her heavy eyelids and John glimpses something
     terrible in her eyes: she's tortured to be alive. He kneels
     beside her and puts a hand on the bed. She takes his little
     finger, wraps her fingers around it.WHITE    9-10-09                                          23.48   EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FRONT PORCH -- NIGHT                       48John opens the door to let Jenna out; she looks considerably

     with his animals, then switches off the lamp. John looks
     back before closing it and watches Luke lie awake, staring
     at the jar, lost in confused thoughts of his mother.51   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - KITCHEN -- NIGHT                             51Dirty dishes piled in the sink, John unloads the dishwasher.
     He finds the handle has cracked off Luke's favorite mug. He
     places the cup and handle on the counter, opens a drawer
     crammed with tools and screws and tape and such. He rummages
     through it. Not finding what he is looking for, he pulls
     handfuls of junk out of the drawer and slams it all down on
     the counter. The harder he searches the more he becomes
     frustrated, until he slams the drawer and leans on the
     counter, feeling destroyed and needy.

     And then a female hand appears beside him, opens another
     drawer and reaches in. John stares at the hand, afraid to
     move, afraid to look up. The hand finds a tube of glue,
     places it on the counter and moves away.

     John turns to see LARA walking away. She turns, smiling and
     shaking her head, and disappears into the dining room.

     Stunned, John looks down at the glue on the counter, then
     suddenly pushes away and rushes into the dining room. No
     sign of her. And she isn't in the living room. He bolts
     into the foyer and finds the front door slightly ajar. He
     flings it open...52   EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- NIGHT                                       52John rushes out into the street, looking up and down for her --

     No takers.JOHN (CONT'D)It is about how rational thought
                  destroys the soul. It is about the
                  triumph of irrationality, and the
                  power that is in it.54   INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - LIBRARY -- DAY                            54John drops an armload of books into a library cart, each
     having something to do with prison or prison life.

     He sits at a table at the back, flipping through them one at
     a time and discards each in turn.

     As the shadows grow longer we find him staring at the computer
     screen linked to the school system.

     ON THE SCREEN: a book summary disappears, to be replaced by
     the school search engine -- many of the items have already
     been inspected. John finds one that reads "Over The Walls."              

     He clicks on the link and the title page appears. The author

     Everyone else looks to the right as the pilot continues.
     John stays fixed on the left window.HIS POINT OF VIEW:The massive rooftops of the jail. But then he sees exactly
     what he is looking for: workmen wearing yellow helmets spread
     hot tar and roofing paper. He spots a workman carrying a
     bucket heading around a tall outcropping on the roof.37.99    INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - CLASSROOM -- DAY                          99LYLA, a student, reads from The Idiot as John returns to his
      desk with papers in his hands. His laptop lies open to Google
      Earth -- the rooftop view of the jail, from another angle.
      John closes it and spreads the papers on his desk -- a printed
      color version of the same. He draws an arrow to the
      outcropping where we now see a door; labels it ELEVATOR.LYLAOn the first landing, which was as
                 small as the necessary turn of the
                 stairs allowed, there was a niche in
                 the column, about a yard wide, and
                 in this niche the prince felt
                 convinced that a man stood concealed.
                 He thought he could distinguish a
                 figure standing there.100   INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- DAY                                         100John searches Craigslist for HELICOPTER PILOTS. Clicks on

      Directly underneath is the Google Earth photo of the rooftop
      of the jail, the door marked with an arrow, and the landing
      site indicated with an X in a circle.

      Below that is a rough sketch of the visitor's room and the
      adjacent corridor with an arrow marking the elevator. In
      block letters beside it is the word "KEY?"101   INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT                             101Luke, John and George stand in the foyer, Luke with his child-

      passenger seat, among a half dozen others. There is a sharp
      RAP on his window; Mouss.

      exactly fit in as he enters and orders. His words are drowned
      out. The bartender gives him a beer on tap. John asks for
      "Hart." The bartender nods to a man at the back who is
      playing a video game. John walks off, passing a LONG-HAIRED

      there for a second, then gets out and enters the restaurant.141   INT. PRIUS -- DAY                                                    141John checks his watch. 2:14. He looks around, knowing he
      is supposed to leave. He makes a call.RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)English Department, this is Catherine.JOHNHi. It's John. Luke isn't feeling
                   well, I'm going to take him home. I

      to his car. The man sees him and stares back. John checks
      his watch. 2:45. The guy drives off, leaving the lot empty.(CONTINUED)49.143   CONTINUED:                                                          143John presses the VOICEMAIL button on his phone.MICK (V.O.)Are you ever going to answer your
                   goddamn phone?

      Suddenly a man in a helmet raps on his side window and John
      realizes MIKE has pulled up without him noticing. His hand
      goes to the split between the seats, but stops short as the
      SECOND RIDER pulls up to the passenger window.MIKEYou were supposed to leave.JOHNI need them.MIKEYou notice that guy was a cop?JOHNWhich guy?MIKEThe one with the red light in his
                   back window.

      John feels ridiculous.       Mike hands him the documents.MIKE (CONT'D)Just give me the money.

      John hands him the envelope of money.       Mike checks it.MIKE (CONT'D)You want this too much. You're going
                   to fuck it up.

      Mike speeds off. The second rider gives John a look and
      follows. John looks over the passports with their new names.144   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - GARAGE -- AFTERNOON                            144Luke gets out of the car and heads into the house, swinging
      his lunch pale. John watches him go, then reaches down beside
      his seat and pulls out the gun, wrapped in a cloth. He hides
      it in the garage and thinks about what he is doing.145   INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- DAY                                145John moves through the line toward the metal detector. He
      takes his key ring out of his pocket and slips it, and the
      separate elevator bump key, into a white plastic dish and(CONTINUED)50.145   CONTINUED:                                                         145places it atop the X-ray machine. He steps through the metal
      detector and then grabs the plastic dish before the guard can
      get to it. He hands the dish to the guard.JOHNHow are you doing today?GUARDDon't touch that.JOHNSorry.

      John puts the dish down, and we see the bump key is gone --
      John palmed it. The guard dumps John's key ring on the
      counter with the keys and cell phones from the other visitors.

      JOHN pockets the palmed key as he enters the jail.146   INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- DAY                                 146John moves down the hall with the fifty or so other visitors.
      He eases toward the elevator, keeping his eye on the guard
      ahead. By the time the group stops for the door ahead to
      open, John's managed to be right beside the elevator.

      He folds his coat over his arm to block others from seeing
      and feels for the slot. Finding it, he slips in the bump
      key. It fits.

      The guard at the lead opens the door to the first visiting
      room and the crowd starts moving again. John quickly bumps
      the key and turns it -- but it won't turn. He bumps it again.
      Visitors keep moving past him.

      He looks over his shoulder, sees the guard following them is
      preoccupied at the door.

      He turns it harder. Nothing.     He tries to pull it out.
      It's stuck. John panics.

      The rear guard closes the entry door and follows the crowd.

      John tugs at it one last time, and then turns it hard and
      snaps it off in the lock. A BLACK WOMAN among the visitors
      sees what he is doing but averts her eyes.

      John drops the rest of the broken key and kicks it into the
      slot between the elevator and the shaft. He slips back into
      the crowd and moves on.

      Near the rear of the crowd now, John approaches the door to
      the visiting room.(CONTINUED)WHITE    9-10-09                                             51.146   CONTINUED:                                                         146He throws a look back, sees another guard step up and try to
      insert his key in the elevator.

      John rounds the corner into the visiting room. The camera
      stays on his face until we finally hear A DEAFENING ALARM.147   INT. COUNTY JAIL - ANOTHER CORRIDOR -- DAY                         147John waits in a line against the wall, beside a door to a
      small office. Through the glass he watches the MAJOR
      interview the black woman who noticed what he was doing.
      She nods and leaves, passing him with a look. The Major
      holds the door open for him.148   INT.    MAJOR'S OFFICE -- A SHORT TIME LATER                       148The MAJOR plays John the CCTV video from the corridor. He
      flips between two camera positions at either end of the hall.
      The crowd of visitors shuffling toward the visiting rooms
      obscures the view of the elevator.MAJORSo, you are where in here?JOHN...In the middle there.MAJORIn the middle. Can you point to
                   yourself?JOHN(looks)

                   me there. Why?

      He freezes the tape and points to a blurry figure in the
      background.MAJORSo that's not you there.   By the

      The Major holds the piece of the key that jammed in the lock.MAJORYou know what a bump key is?JOHNSorry.

      Major puts it on the desk and just stares at John.    Finally:MAJORIf this was you, you might want to
                   think about what's going to happen

                   are in prison.

      The major stares right through him.149   INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- DAY                                149John heads toward the exit, accompanied by a guard. As he
      nears the elevator he sees a technician climbing a step
      ladder, holding a new CCTV camera.150   INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- DAY                              150Face chalk white, John heads for the exit, fighting the urge
      to run. The door opens just before he gets there and Collero
      steps in, Quinn holding the door for her. John charges past,
      noticing neither of them -- but Quinn recognizes him. Quinn
      turns and watches as John doubles over the short wall nearby
      and vomits.DETECTIVE COLLERO-- The worst date you've ever been

      John turns and notices Quinn, behind the door, watching him.
      They lock eyes. Collero realizes that Quinn isn't paying
      attention and wonders what he's looking at.DETECTIVE COLLERO (CONT'D)...What?(CONTINUED)53.150   CONTINUED:                                                          150John turns and walks away.     Quinn keeps watching.DETECTIVE QUINNDid I tell you not to date cops?

      Collero's eyes find John as well.      He disappears around the
      corner.151   INT. T-TRAIN -- DAY                                                 151John rides home, devastated that his plan has failed, and
      wondering what he will do. He checks over his shoulder to
      make sure he isn't being followed.152   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- DAY                                           152John sits on the bare wood floor of the living room. His
      head turns as he hears someone POUNDING on the front door.
      He throws a look to the garage, thinks about the gun;
      dismisses the idea. Then he hears the voice: his brother.MICK (O.S.)Let me in, asshole!!153   EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FRONT PORCH -- CONTINUOUS                      153Mick bangs again.MICK (O.S.)Open up!

      room and dining room have been stripped of every bit of
      furniture, save an old TV set sitting on a box. John knows
      he can't let his brother see this.

      The MALE NEIGHBOR in the house to the south opens his door
      and looks out and scowls.MALE NEIGHBORWhat's your problem? He's not home!MICKNot home?

      test results. He opens the back door of the van.166   EXT.    STREETS -- DAY                                             166John follows the van.167   EXT.    NURSING HOME -- DAY                                        167John watches as the driver steps out with a tray, point and
      push his key fob, lock the doors and enter the nursing home.              

      IN THE PRIUS - MOMENTS LATER - John watches his stopwatch.
      The driver returns with a tray. John hits the stop button.1 MINUTE 48 SECONDS.168   INT.

MEDICAL FACILITY -- DAY                                       172Wearing his iPod, the driver steps out with a tray and presses
      his key fob; the van chirps and locks. He enters the building
      as John steps up to the driver's door.

      John checks no one is watching, places the tennis ball over
      the key slot and punches the ball flat. The lock pops open.60.173   INT. LABORATORY VAN -- CONTINUOUS                                  173Shelves line the walls; on them sit plastic trays of envelopes.

      his watch, only 44 seconds have lapsed. He slips the card
      out, photographs it with his cell phone and puts it back.176   EXT. MEDICAL FACILITY -- DAY                                       176The driver heads for the van as John opens the back door and
      climbs out. Oblivious to his narrow escape, John closes the
      door and walks away a heartbeat before the driver gets there.177   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- EVENING                                      177John checks his son, who sits on the bare living room floor

      staring at the wall. He takes his father's hand, and the
      two just stand there in silence.181   INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- DAY                            181John waits as the other prisoners enter. Lara kisses him;                         
      looks in his eyes. He sees the despair behind the smile.JOHN...What's wrong?

      She takes a letter from her pocket.JOHN (CONT'D)What is it?

      He rifles through a drawer, finds a pair of sunglasses.

      He snatches a baseball cap from a top shelf.

      He tosses a bag on the bed, unzips it and pulls out the gun.184   EXT. AIRPORT LONG TERM PARKING LOT -- DAY                          184John unscrews the license plate from a dusty black Prius.
      He sticks the plate under his jacket, stands and checks over
      his shoulder as he walks out of the massive parking lot.185   INT. BANK AND MALL PARKING LOT -- DAY                              185A quiet neighborhood bank sits in the corner of an outdoor
      mall. The Prius pulls into a spot; we dolly over to see the
      stolen license plate.

      Inside the Prius, John opens the backpack, puts on the hat
      and sunglasses and places the gun on his lap. And again he
      looks at the bank, tapping his toe manically. A guard opens
      the bank door for a departing customer, smiles and heads
      back inside. John tightens his grip on the gun, tries to
      work up his courage, but ultimately realizes he can't do
      this.

      Furious with himself, he jams the car into reverse and backs
      up without looking. He hears a scream, brakes hard and looks.

      A WOMAN screams. John stomps on the brakes. He leaps out
      of the car and sees a woman dropping her groceries and
      scooping her child up in her arms. Call her ELAINE.ELAINEWhat are you doing?!   You almost
                 killed us!JOHNAre you --?ELAINEAre you out of your mind?!   You don't

      She stands and runs for her car. John returns to the car
      and sits, leaving the door open and the door alarm screaming.
      He sits there, letting the failure and his disgust for his
      weakness wash over him.186   INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- AFTERNOON                          186John sits in the children's area, waiting for the line of
      visitors to get shorter. One look at his face and we can
      see how tortured he is. He has his cell phone to his ear:MEYER (O.S.)I'm sorry.JOHNNo, it was a long shot.       Thanks.187   INT. CRIMINAL COURTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS                              187MEYER(into phone)

      She leans forward and whispers in his ear.LARA (CONT'D)I grabbed the fire extinguisher. I
                   hit her in the face. I heard her
                   neck snap. You know why I did it?
                   Because she pissed me off. I threw
                   her purse in the river. We paid for
                   dinner with the cash from her wallet.

      She sits back a bit to look in his face. Only now, looking
      in his eyes, a crack forms in her tough exterior.LARA (CONT'D)I'm sorry.   I'm actually very sorry.

      She stands. The guard opens the door and lets her into the
      changing room. John watches, unable to breathe.190   INT. COUNTY JAIL - CHANGING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS                  190Lara gets one last look at John, through the glass, and then

      him behind. The guard following the group sees him standing
      there. Commands him:GUARD #2Sir, you cannot stand there.

      She opens her mouth to object but John slams the phone into

      where he noticed kids selling drugs.

      A car shows up - the same flashy car he saw weeks ago. The
      street dealer looks around, runs to the window, makes an
      exchange, and then the car drives off again. John checks
      his watch and settles in to wait.198   EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT                                         198John watches as other cars drive up and score drugs. And
      then finally the flashy car cruises up again. John checks
      his watch: it has been two hours. Again the street dealer
      runs up and hands the driver an envelope. We recognize the
      driver -- he is the one from earlier, whom we are going to
      call DAVID. He drives away. John follows.199   EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT                                         199John follows the flashy car at a distance.    It stops at

      The flashy car parks and David crosses the street.

      Half a block back, John turns left at the corner and then
      makes a quick right into the alley. He guesses how many
      houses from the corner David stopped, gets out and checks
      over the fences.

      He stops a few houses away when he sees the porch light on a
      house flick on. David waits on the dilapidated back porch.
      He waves to whoever is watching him through the pinhole and
      the light goes out again.(CONTINUED)WHITE    9-10-09                                                68.200   CONTINUED:                                                            200John inches closer as the back door opens. David exchanges
      a few words with whoever opened it and then packages are
      exchanged. The door closes and David walks off the way he
      came.

      John waits a moment, then moves down the alley, hops the
      fence, and sneaks through the twisted bramble of the back
      yard. He finds a place to hide, on the ground right beside
      the back porch. He pulls out his gun and settles in to wait
      between the trash cans, his heart pounding in his ears.

      on and John is bathed in bright light -- he didn't realize
      he'd fallen asleep. David stands above him on the porch,
      holding the screen door open -- if he glanced down there is
      no way he wouldn't see him.

      John holds his     breath and waits. The porch light flicks
      off, the locks     are unbolted, and finally the thick door opens.
      As before, the     two exchange words, but now the POUNDING in
      John's ears is     so loud we can barely hear anything else.

      John takes a deep breath and springs to his feet -- knocking
      over the trash cans -- and onto the porch!

      He smacks David with the gun, grabs him by the hair and jams
      him forward into the doorway, preventing the supplier --

      Suddenly a THUG comes barreling in from the kitchen and aims
      a sawed-off shotgun at John, who keeps himself right behind
      David's head. The dialogue is almost drowned out completely
      by the sound of POUNDING in John's ears and David's SCREAMING.ALEX-- Shoot them both!JOHN-- I'll shoot the dog!(CONTINUED)69.202   CONTINUED:                                                      202ALEX-- Shoot the dog!THUG-- You shoot the dog, I'll kill you!

      He shoves David forward, closer to Alex.ALEXYou're dead.DAVIDI didn't do anything!!ALEXYou brought him!DAVIDI didn't bring him!JOHNShut up!

      He pushes them both back into the next room; the dog in the
      closet never stops barking.203   INT. ALEX'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT                                              203John shoves David to the floor and waves the gun between
      them.JOHNOn your knees! Hands behind your
                   head!

      John catches Alex's eyes darting to the counter. Following
      his gaze he finds Alex's revolver on the counter. John grabs
      it, flips open the cylinder and spills out the cartridges.DAVIDI can't kneel!JOHNOn the floor!

      David kneels with great difficulty.         Alex calmly does as
      he's told, his eyes on John.(CONTINUED)71.203   CONTINUED:                                                          203John grabs the paper bag out of Alex's hand and opens it,

      Alex scoffs, seeing weakness in John.ALEXYeah, I'm going to give you my money.JOHNI'll shoot you!ALEXYou won't even shoot a dog.JOHNTell me!ALEXShoot the floor again, impress me.

      John pistol-whips him and Alex goes down. John holds his

                   now you've done it. Go home. I'll
                   come find you and kill you.

      John looks around desperately. He spots an open bottle of
      tequila in the clutter on the counter. He grabs it and pours
      it on the floor.ALEX (CONT'D)You're wasting some good shit.

      Now he pours it on Alex.JOHNYeah, good shit; high alcohol content.

      John smashes the bottle on the floor; tequila goes everywhere.THUG (O.S.)What's going on?! Let me out!ALEXYou going to burn me out?

      John lights a rag as the thug in the closet continues to
      yell and pound. Now calmly:JOHNYeah.    That's what I'm going to do.DAVIDOh Jesus.    Oh Jesus.JOHNYour money.ALEX(no longer smiling)
                   This is a meth lab, you idiot!JOHNNo.    It was.

      John doesn't shoot. He grabs David by the hair, sticks the
      gun in his temple and shoves him into the front hall.DAVIDLet me go!!JOHNGet up there!!

      John pushes him up the stairs as a shield, following the
      trail of blood.DAVIDThe house is going to explode!ANGLE ON BACK DOORFire spreads, the thug yells, the dog barks. The shotgun
      leans against the wall where the thug left it. The closet
      door rocks as the thug kicks. The chair won't give way.204   INT. ALEX'S HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR -- NIGHT                         204John moves David quickly up the stairs in front of him and
      down the hall. They peer into one room, nothing. Into the
      next - what is clearly a CHILD'S ROOM.

      Alex kneels on the far side of the room, barely visible behind
      the small bed, his back to us.

      Until he wheels, gun in hand, and FIRES twice.

      A bullet strikes David in the chest, the second grazes John's
      side. Both men are knocked back into the hall and onto the
      floor. John pulls himself out from under David as...

      Running on adrenaline, Alex stands and strides forward.
      David looks up at him. Alex shoots him again and steps over
      him into the hall. He sees John, raises his weapon and....

      John fires twice, hits Alex in the chest, knocking him down.(CONTINUED)74.204   CONTINUED:                                                         204John stands. Alex lies dead, sprawled over David.   David
      looks around through the roiling smoke:JOHNIs anyone up here?!

      He steps over Alex and into the room. He checks the closet --
      empty of clothes; clearly no child lives here. John turns
      to where Alex was kneeling, sees a bureau pushed aside, a
      safe crudely installed in the wall lying open, a trash bag
      on the floor half-filled with cash.

      John drops to his knees and shovels the remaining cash into
      the trash bag.205   INT. ALEX'S HOUSE - BACK HALL -- CONTINUOUS                        205The dog barks; the door SPLINTERS.206   INT.

                   burn. Don't let me burn.

      The hall is now thick with smoke. John stares terrified at
      the two men, one dead, one dying, and agonizes over what he
      knows is a mistake. Cut to BLACK.207   INT. ALEX'S HOUSE - BACK HALL -- MOMENTS LATER                     207John carries David past the closet just as the thug's boot
      kicks a hole in the door. Cut to BLACK.208   EXT. ALLEY BEHIND ALEX'S HOUSE -- NIGHT                            208John, bleeding himself, shoves the badly wounded dealer into
      the back seat. He throws the trash bag into the passenger
      seat and slams the door closed behind him. Not even a
      heartbeat later THE GERMAN SHEPHERD leaps up and snaps at
      the partially open window. John struggles to get the car
      turned on and the window up as THE DOG tries to force his
      way into the car.

      Through the front windshield he sees THE THUG leap over the
      back fence, landing sprawled in the alley with the shotgun.

      John jams the car into reverse and backs away -- the man in
      the back seat screaming for his life, the dog chasing the
      car, the thug getting off a shot.75.209   EXT. STREET -- CONTINUOUS                                          209John swerves wide around the corner, hitting a fire hydrant

      the street.

      The dog barking disappears. All that's left are the sounds
      of the dying man. John keeps throwing looks over his
      shoulder.DAVIDI don't want to die.   I don't want
                 to die.

      Now at a safe distance, John pulls over and looks into the
      back seat. We don't have to see the body to know he's dead.

      John sits there a moment, listening to the sounds of
      approaching fire engines. He catches a glimpse of himself
      in the rearview mirror before pulling out. Cut to BLACK.211   EXT. BUS STOP -- NIGHT                                             211John's car idles at the curb, his back door sits open. He
      steps back into shot from the far side of the Prius, closes
      the door and gets in. As he drives away we see David's body
      lying on the bench, waiting to be discovered.212   INT. FAST FOOD JOINT - TOILET -- NIGHT                             212Standing at the sink shirtless, John pours alcohol on the
      wound in his side.

      He mops up the blood with a wad of paper towels, then applies
      a bandage, fresh from the box. He pulls a new shirt and
      jacket from a Target bag.

      A moment later, now dressed, John stuffs the trash bag full
      of cash into his backpack.213   INT. FAST FOOD JOINT -- NIGHT                                      213John steps out of the bathroom, zipping his new jacket. He

      of the restaurant. Cut to BLACK.76.214   EXT. ALEX'S HOUSE -- NIGHT                                         214Water streams from the house, the front door and windows

      from the lock. It's the middle of the night, so he is
      surprised to see a light on in the kitchen. He enters,
      carrying his jacket and backpack, and places them on a chair.
      When he gets to the kitchen he sees his father in his pajamas,
      reading a biography and sipping a cup of tea.JOHNHi.    What are you doing up?

      George shrugs.     An uncomfortable silence.JOHN (CONT'D)I've come to get Luke.

      George nods. After another silence, John starts down the
      hall. His father appears in the hallway behind him.GEORGEJohn?    Are you alright?

      John turns around, surprised.JOHNI'm fine.

      The two men look at each other for a moment, John leaves the
      room.

      His father steps into the living room and notices his jacket
      falling off the chair. George lifts it to set it right and
      sees something is sticking out of the backpack: airplane
      tickets and passports.218   INT. JOHN'S OLD ROOM -- CONTINUOUS                                 218John steps into the room that he had as a teenager. Luke
      sleeps in the single bed. John sits beside him, touches his
      face, then looks around the room, wondering how he got here,
      and is overwhelmed.219   INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS                  219George slips the tickets and passports out of the side pocket.

      this. He tries to wake Luke.JOHNHey.   Hey, buddy.

      Not a chance. John checks the old alarm clock: it's just
      after three AM. He lies down beside Luke for just a moment.221   INT. JOHN'S OLD ROOM -- NIGHT                                    221John WAKES to the sound of a whistle. He checks the clock.

      John thinks about saying something, can't.   He watches Luke
      give Grace a kiss.LUKEThank you, Grandma.

      John turns to his father, who stands in the doorway.

      His father holds out the jacket in silence. John takes it.

      looks at his father, who gazes back at him in silence. John
      can tell by the look in his father's eye that he knows.JOHNBye Mom.

      They kiss.    John's father stands behind him.GEORGEGoodbye.

      Luke gives up on the truck and moves to his bedside table.
      He digs his hand into the small jar of coins his dad gave
      him and starts stuffing them in his pants pocket.

      A quarter falls and rolls to the middle of the floor.227   INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- MORNING                                     227John takes a thick felt marker and writes two numbers on his              
      wrist, right beside the watch. 15, and under it, 35.                      

      He then turns and stares at his wall, all the photos,

      decides it is too late to worry. He loosens an edge of
      wallpaper and starts tearing it all down.228   EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - GARAGE AND ALLEY -- MORNING                   228Luke sits in the back seat with their carry-on bags. John

      He hears Nabulsi's heavy feet on the stairs, angles and aims
      the weapon -- Lara can't believe what she's witnessing.
      Suddenly the doors close, just a heartbeat before Nabulsi
      gets there. Nabulsi spots the discarded lab coats and runs
      out into THE GARAGE. He heads for the ramp, scanning the
      parked cars.

      Getting to the bottom of the ramp he looks up and sees a
      SQUAD CAR racing down toward him. As it brakes, Nabulsi

      he sees a squad car screeching to a halt. He grabs Lara's
      hand and leads her out of the elevator and around the corner.

      They weave down a corridor, deeper into the hospital, passing
      another cop at the Emergency Desk who has his back to them.

      They turn the corner, see a hospital guard running toward
      them. John recognizes him as the guard he argued with when
      Lara attempted suicide. John stiffens, but the guard runs
      past -- looking for a couple in lab coats. They quicken
      their steps. The guard stops at the end of the hall and
      turns to stare, recognizing them. He lifts his walkie and
      speaks.HOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #1Main floor, rear corridor.

       Venezuela. And he thinks of his grandson and smiles.341    EXT. VENEZUELAN COUNTRYSIDE (HELICOPTER SHOT) -- DAY                341A taxi snakes along a mountain road, through the dense forests

       extinguisher and she falls dead.

       The extinguisher is tossed to the floor and rolls.

       A YOUNG FEMALE JUNKIE yanks at Elizabeth's purse, getting                  
       blood on her hands before she frees it. She looks like a                   
       junkie. She runs off toward the sidewalk.344A   QUINN - IN THE PRESENT                                              344ATurns and sees...344B   LARA - IN THE PAST                                                  344BShe hurries along the sidewalk to get out of the rain.                     
       Turning the corner into the garage she COLLIDES with the                   
       JUNKIE. Lara's purse catches the woman's coat.                             

       The JUNKIE puts her hand on Lara's shoulder, leaving a SMUDGE              
       OF ELIZABETH'S BLOOD on Lara's raincoat. She tugs free. A                  
       BUTTON from the woman's coat POPS OFF and hits the sidewalk.

       Lara turns and yells "Hey," then keeps going.

       She is about to get in the car when she sees the fire
       extinguisher in front of her left wheel. She picks it up,
       turns, annoyed. She places it down by the wall.(CONTINUED)115.344B   CONTINUED:                                                          344BLara gets in her car and drives off, oblivious to Elizabeth's           
       body lying on the concrete floor on the passenger's side.

       Her co-worker sees her drive off as he steps into the garage.           
       He spots the body and turns and looks after Lara's car.345    EXT. LARA'S OFFICE BUILDING - PARKING LOT -- DAY                    345Quinn puts his used gum in a wrapper. COLLERO watches from              
       the car as her partner walks to the corner of the building.             
       QUINN steps up to where the two women collided and looks                
       down at the sidewalk.DETECTIVE QUINNWas it raining when we searched the

                    here?

       Quinn drops his gum wrapper onto the sidewalk. It hits a                
       stream of water coming out from a rain gutter and washes                
       away. Quinn watches it -- then follows... Collero shakes                
       her head, grabs a newspaper to keep the rain off and follows.

       The gum wrapper washes over the curb into the gutter and                
       travels to the storm drain a half a block away.

       Quinn gets there, kneels.DETECTIVE QUINNAct like a cop. Grab the other side.DETECTIVE COLLEROYou're out of your mind.

       Quinn jerks the grate up.    Collero grabs the other side and
       helps him lift.

       They stare down into the hole. Quinn runs his hand along
       the lip, digging up the mud and sediment...finds nothing.DETECTIVE COLLERO (CONT'D)You really thought you were going to
                    find it?

       Collero wipes her hands on a tissue as Quinn stares down the
       hole a little longer, then lets the grate fall.(CONTINUED)116.345   CONTINUED:                                                        345CLOSE ON INSIDE LIP OF STORM DRAINJust before the grate clangs we see JUNKIE'S JACKET BUTTON,

      door. Lara steps out, a real awkwardness between them.

      She touches his hand. He offers a smile. She slips past
      him. He steps into the bathroom and closes the door. Lara
      lies down on the single bed furthest from the bathroom, face
      to face with her sleeping son.

      Without warning, he kisses her on the cheek, for the first
      time, without being prodded. He turns around and lets her
      wrap her arms around him. And she almost dies of happiness.348   INT. HOTEL BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS                                 348John washes, trying not to look in the mirror, not wanting

      stations. And there it is: CNN in English. Sports right
      now, but John knows there is no place they can hide.350   INT. BAR -- DAY                                                   350Damon takes the money from John's wallet, leaves him with a
