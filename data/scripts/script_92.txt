          CLOSE-- One hand opens the oven, and, mittened by an apron, removes
          a tray of perfectly baked pirozhoki, which the other hand replaces with the
          fresh tray . . . slightly burning itself on a knuckle.TITLE OVER:FEBRUARY 1872POKROVSKOE, KONSTANTIN LEVIN'S ESTATE300 MILES SOUTH OF MOSCOW:INT. KITCHEN, POKROVSKOE, SAME TIME--NIGHTAgafia sucks her knuckle and checks what's cooking on the stove-top. She is

          A Kitchen Maid at the sink obediently dries her hands on her apron. A
          dozing dog, Laska, pricks up her ears.EXT. YARD, POKROVSKOE, SAME TIME--NIGHTIt's snowing. The Kitchen Maid, shawled, with a lantern, makes her way
          across the yard towards the cowshed, a short distance, and pushes open the
          frozen door. Laska is at her heels, but is made to stay outside.3INT. COWSHED, POKROVSKOE, SAME TIME--NIGHTThe herd stirs at the lantern light. The bull, Berkut, with a ring through
          his nose, snorts as the girl goes by. At the back of the shed a cow is calving.
                         
          Levin is midwifing, sleeves pulled back, blood and slime up to his elbows.
          He is 34. His steward, Vasili, holds up a lantern. Levin pulls carefully at
          the emerging forefeet.LEVINGood girl . . . good girl, Pava.

          He has a book on a book-rest. Agafia ladles soup for him. Three generations
          of family portraits look down on him.LEVIN. . . She's a beauty. That's twelve cows sired

           made you for.
                         
          Levin evades, ducks into spooning up soup, finding his place in his book.
          Agafia goes out. Alone, Levin closes the book and stares into himself.INT. (MOSCOW)-- DAYCLOSE--Expert fingers scrape a cut-throat razor across a lathered
          cheek . . . and again, skirting luxuriant facial hair on pampered skin.TITLE OVER:PRINCE OBLONSKY'S HOUSE, MOSCOWINT. OBLONSKY'S DRESSING ROOM, OBLONSKYHOUSE, SAME TIME-- DAYThere is a door to the landing and a door to the bedroom.5Prince Stepan Oblonsky-- Stiva to his friends--is 34 and liked by every-
          body. A barber comes in every morning to shave him. His valet, Matvey, is
          older and almost a friend. He holds up an enormous pear.MATVEYWhat should I do with this?
                         
          Oblonsky puts the barber on hold to have a look.OBLONSKYWhere did you find it?MATVEYIn your hat. Your Excellency.
                         
          Oblonsky thinks about it, lets the barber finish. He stands and removes his
          dressing gown.OBLONSKYYes . . . I picked it up somewhere for Daria
           Alexandrovna and the children.
                         
          Matvey is ready with Oblonsky's shirt, which he puts over his master's head
          like a horse's collar.INT. "DAY NURSERY," OBLONSKY HOUSE, SAMETIME--DAYThere is a sloping lineup of five children, aged eight, five, four, three and
          two, dressed and brushed for presentation to their mother, Princess Daria
          Oblonsky, known as Dolly . . . who we now see is heavily pregnant. Stand-
          ing by is a French governess, Mlle. Roland, and a Nurse. Mlle. Roland
          is buxom.6Dolly picks up the youngest, Vasya, to kiss him and hands him to the
          Nurse, and kisses the others in ascending order.DOLLYBonjour, Lili; bonjour, Masha; bonjour,
           Grisha; bonjour, Tanya.
                         
           Who's coming to see Grandmama?INT. OBLONSKY'S DRESSING ROOM, SAME TIME--DAYOblonsky, dressed now and holding a cup of coffee, checks from the window.OBLONSKY'S POV--Dolly, in furs, the four youngest children and the Nurse, who carries Vasya,
          all wrapped up against the cold weather, have come out of the house to a
          waiting sleigh, as noisy as starlings, bickering, competing, reprimanding.
          The Oblonsky's Coachman assists, with a rug to spread across knees.
                         
          Oblonsky hands his coffee to Matvey and lights a small cigar. He detours
          to take a sugared almond from a dish of sweets, and leaves the room . . .INT. SCHOOLROOM, OBLONSKY HOUSE, SAMETIME--DAYTanya is at her lessons with Mlle. Roland. When Oblonsky's face appears
          smiling round the door, Tanya jumps up and runs to him, greeting him,
          laughing, kissing his face, hanging on his neck.7OBLONSKYMy Tanruchoshka! Mind my cigar.
                         
          He pops the sugared almond into her mouth and puts a conspiratorial finger
          to his lips. Mlle. Roland, who has stood up for him, clucks in reprimand.OBLONSKY (CONT'D)Be good today. I'm off.
                         
          Tanya runs back to her seat and bends to her schoolbook. Oblonsky looks
          Mlle. Roland in the eye. He moves his head slightly, unmistakably ask-
          ing her to come outside. Mlle. Roland moves her eyes at him in humorous
          reproach. Clearly, this is familiar ground. Oblonsky closes the door behind
          him.

          Annushka is young, loyal, modest.
                         
          Anna is at her dressing-table-bureau, which is host to at least two pho-
          tographs of a small boy (Serozha) and a child's unframed drawing of
          "Maman." As she starts reading the letter, Anna's eyes frown.FLASH BACK, VERY SHORT, ALMOST SUBLIMINAL--INT. (LINEN CLOSET)--DAYOblonsky and Mlle.

           governess.
                         
          Anna is speaking to her husband "confidentially." Karenin, a busy man,
          drains his coffee cup and hands it (as with Oblonsky and Matvey) to his
          valet, Korney, who bows and withdraws. Karenin continues transferring
          papers from his desk to his portfolio . . .
                         
          Which done, he nods to his private secretary, Mikhail Slyudin, who comes
          forward to receive it, bows and leaves.10KARENINWell . . . ?
                         
          Karenin is twenty years older than Anna and a senior figure in govern-
          ment. He has an unattractive reedy voice and is pleased with himself as a
          model of probity. He has the habit of cracking his knuckles.ANNAStiva wants me to come to Moscow . . . to
           persuade Dolly to forgive him.KARENINI'm to be deprived of my wife so that adul-
           tery may be forgiven? I can't excuse him
           just because he's your brother.ANNAIt's for Dolly's sake too.KARENIN(has to go)
           I have four committees today . . .
                         
          There is another interruption: Serozha, aged seven and a half, and his
          tutor, Vasily Lukich, enter for a ritual "good morning." Serozha is a little
          frightened of his father, but the mother and son are in love. Anna goes
          straight to Serozha, her heart lifted, to hug him.KARENIN (CONT'D)Good, good!--I have the world waiting
           for me, there's never time to look at your
           exercises!11LUKICHSergei Alexeyich is doing very well, Your

           perhaps tomorrow.
                         
          Lukich bows. Anna goes with Serozha, relinquishing him finally. She closes
          the door on them.ANNAAlexei, do you think nine years of mar-
           riage and children should count for nothing
           against a . . . an infatuation?
                         
          Karenin cracks his knuckles, concedes.KARENINNo. Very well.
           (kisses her hand)
           But sin has a price, you may be sure of that.INT. OBLONSKY'S DRESSING ROOM, OBLONSKYHOUSE--DAYOblonsky has been bunking down on his couch. He moans and groans. He
          gets up and tries the door to the bedroom. It's locked. He knocks timidly.12OBLONSKY(PITEOUSLY)Dolly . . . please think of the children . . .
                         
          He listens hopefully. The other door, leading to the upper landing, is opened
          violently by Dolly.DOLLYYou think of the children! Their lives are
           ruined now!
                         
          She slams the door behind her.INT. BEDROOM LEVEL, OBLONSKY HOUSE, SAMETIME--DAYOblonsky comes out of his dressing room to see the main bedroom door
          slammed. He attempts to go in but the door is locked.OBLONSKYOh, Dolly . . . I beg you . . .

          Oblonsky tears open the telegram.13MATVEYDon't worry, sir, things will shape them-

           saved.INT. OBLONSKY'S OFFICE, MOSCOW--DAYInner doors open and Oblonsky comes out of his private office. He is his
          genial self. Everyone in the general office-- minor officials, clerks-- stands
          up for him and bows. Oblonsky is wearing government uniform--green
          coat with gold embroidery on the collar--instead of his own coat. Oblonsky
          is helped out of one coat into the other.DOORKEEPERSome man came without an appointment,

          Oblonsky opens the door to look. Levin is sitting waiting on a bench, wear-
          ing a sheepskin coat, cap and scuffed boots.OBLONSKYLevin! Where did you disappear?

           advice.14OBLONSKYWell, then, come into my room.
                         
          Oblonsky leads Levin back through the general office, where everyone stands
          up again. Levin's sheepskin and boots attract curious glances.OBLONSKY (CONT'D)This is my oldest friend, Konstantin Dmit-
           rich Levin! Someone send word I'll be a few
           minutes late.INT. OBLONSKY'S PRIVATE OFFICE, SAME TIME--DAYOblonsky leads Levin inside and closes the door.OBLONSKYI've been hard at it. Sit down.
                         
          Levin undoes his coat and sits down.LEVINHard at what exactly?OBLONSKYWhy, we're overwhelmed with work!LEVINOh--paperwork.OBLONSKYPaperwork is the soul of Russia. Farming
           is only the stomach. When am I going to
           come and shoot some snipe?
                         
          Seeing the clothes Levin is wearing, he laughs.15OBLONSKY (CONT'D)Oh, but look at you, in Western clothes
          you told me you'd never wear again. Some-
          thing's up.LEVINYes. I'm in love. I've come back to propose.
          Have you guessed who she is?OBLONSKY(rolls his eyes comically)
          I have a suspicion. Why didn't you propose
          when you were here?LEVINI decided it was impossible. Kitty is of the
          heavens, an angel, and I am of the earth--
          but then I thought and thought, and . . .
          there's no life for me without her! . . . Do I
          have a chance?OBLONSKYOf course you do. The Shcherbatskys are
          giving a soiree this evening. Get there early
          before the crowd. If I may suggest . . .LEVINAnything! What?OBLONSKYNew boots.LEVINRight. Anything else?16OBLONSKY(HESITATES)We'd better have dinner together.

           Or do you prefer the Hermitage?
                         
          Oblonsky ushers Levin back into the general office.INT. GENERAL OFFICE, SAME TIME--DAY. . . Everyone stands up as before. The Doorkeeper produces Oblonsky's top-
          coat and helps him into it.OBLONSKYNo--five-thirty at l'Angleterre--I owe them
           more than the Hermitage, so it wouldn't be
           fair to withdraw my custom.

           Boots, and a coat. And a proper hat.

          hat and boots.17INT. L'ANGLETERRE RESTAURANT, MOSCOW--NIGHTOblonsky and Levin preside over the debris of three dozen oysters, with
          champagne in a bucket to hand. Oblonsky is in a maudlin mood, afloat
          on champagne.OBLONSKYIt's so unfair. You marry for love, you're
           a good husband. Children arrive. Years
           depart. And all of a sudden your wife is
           tired, her hair is thin, her body . . . while
           you yourself still have your . . . vigour . . .
           and you find yourself distracted by a pretty
           woman . . .LEVINForgive me, but I find that incomprehen-
           sible . . . As though I'd leave this restaurant
           and steal a roll from a baker's shop.OBLONSKYWell, you know, a freshly baked roll . . .LEVINBut I'm talking about love, and you're talk-

           Count Vronsky?LEVINWho? No. Why?18OBLONSKYHe's your rival. He turned up from St.
           Petersburg after you left.LEVIN(AGHAST)Who is he?OBLONSKY(CHANGING TACK)You don't have to worry about him. He's
           one of those rich, good-looking cavalry offi-

           to pretty women . . .

          Anna comes out with Annushka, who has a large soft bag containing
          everything her mistress needs for the journey. Kapitonich holds the carriage
          door for them.INT. MOVING TRAIN--NIGHTAnna has a window seat. Next to her is Annushka.
                         
          In the opposite window seat is Countess Vronsky, at sixty losing the battle to
          keep her youthful beauty. She has a lap dog (and perhaps a Fabergï¿½-topped
          walking cane). Next to her is her Maid.
                         
          Anna is not happy to be leaving. She holds a small framed photo of Sero-
          zha, which she then puts away in her red bag. Countess Vronsky smiles at
          her. Anna wipes her eyes, explains.ANNAIt's the first time I've left my little boy.COUNTESS VRONSKYSo you are leaving your son and I am return-

          Princess Shcherbatsky, and a crowd of guests who have arrived together, are
          greeting each other. Levin has to make a quick decision, and he makes the
          wrong one--to go on.LEVINWhat I mean to say--I came with only one

          Levin reacts, decides to leave. He makes for the door. He nearly collides
          with someone, gives and receives an apology, and suddenly understands who

          alphabet bricks. Grisha is on Anna's lap pulling at her hair. The spelling

          She hears the sound of the doorbell.INT. ENTRANCE HALL, OBLONSKY HOUSE, SAMETIME--NIGHTVronsky has been let in spattered with snow.SERVANT. . . no, Your Excellency . . . He's just gone
           up. . . . The Princess retired early . . . Is
           there a message?
                         
          Vronsky glances up and sees Anna looking down. Their eyes meet. A second
          passes. Vronsky is about to speak. Anna turns away and moves out of his
          view, towards further stairs, with her book.VRONSKYNo.45EXT. NEAR POKROVSKOE--DAYLevin is coming home in a sleigh, driven by his one-eyed coachman, Ignat.
          He is huddled under a bearskin blanket. The house is in sight.
                         
          The sleigh overtakes a Peasant Woman, Serafina, walking to the house car-
          rying a big bundle of willow wands strapped to her back: a strong young
          woman with a handsome face. She stops and bows her head. Levin looks at
          her. She then looks him in the face.
                         
          Laska, barking joyfully, races from the house.INT. BATHHOUSE, POKROVSKOE-- DAYThe bathhouse has a stove which heats water. There is a brazier to create
          instant steam, but not now. Levin, almost naked, lies on a plank deck,
          thoughtful, staring at something . . . no, at someone: Serafina, who is put-
          ting on her clothes. Postcoitum. She has no angst. Dressed, she crosses herself.LEVINWill you go to confession?
                         
          Serafina nods indifferently.LEVIN (CONT'D)God will forgive you.SERAFINAAnd you also, master. He is watching.LEVINGod forgive us then, for committing the act
           of love.
                         
          She nods without irony.46SERAFINAHe is merciful.LEVIN"Not according to my deserts, O Lord,
           but according to thy mercy"--that's a fine
           prayer. But I'm full of doubt. Sometimes I
           even doubt that God exists.SERAFINAHow can there be anything if God didn't
           make it?LEVINI don't know. One day science will tell us.SERAFINAThat's sinful talk if the priest heard you.LEVINWell, I won't go to confession.SERAFINA(SHRUGS)Your father built the church. You're con-
           fessed a while yet.
                         
          Levin feels outplayed.SERAFINA (CONT'D)Will you bring me something from
           Moscow?LEVINWhat would you like?47SERAFINASoap, the kind wrapped in paper to look
           pretty, and smelling like for a proper lady.
                         
          Levin is touched. He nods.SOUND OVER--MUSIC OVERLAP WITH THE BALL.INT. THE BALL, MOSCOW--NIGHTKitty enters the Ball, a proper lady.
                         
          This is a gilded affair, conducted by a Master of Ceremonies. The Host
          and Hostess are positioned to welcome each guest. Dancing has started-- a
          waltz.
                         
          Kitty and her parents enter the ballroom and are received by their hosts.
          Everything has come together for Kitty--her dress, her hair, her skin, her
          moment. She radiates happiness. An Officer stands aside to let them pass,
          openly admiring Kitty, smoothing his moustache. A Youth having trouble
          with his white tie hurries past but turns back to Kitty.YOUTHKitty! May I have a waltz?KITTYYou may, Boris. I'll save you the third just
           because it's your first ball.YOUTH(THRILLED)You're my first conquest.
                         
          The Master of Ceremonies, Korsunsky, arrives and without permission
          sweeps her into the waltz.48KORSUNSKYIt's a relaxation to dance with you, Princess.
                         
          Kitty sees Anna arriving with Oblonsky and gives a little gasp at her
          God-given beauty.KORSUNSKY (CONT'D)But back to work! Where do you want to
           be taken?KITTYThere.
                         
          Korsunsky waltzes her brilliantly through the dancers and twirls her to
          rest in front of a small group including Anna and Oblonsky-- floating
          Kitty's train.KORSUNSKY(BOWING)So that your ankles may be seen.
                         
          Anna appraises Kitty at a glance and gives her a tiny nod signifying top
          marks. Kitty glows.KITTYHow are you, Stiva?OBLONSKYThanks to Anna, I am a happy man. Would
           you like to dance?KITTYNo, ask Anna.49ANNA(DEMURS)No . . . I don't . . .
                         
          She looks up and sees Vronsky coming straight towards her.ANNA (CONT'D)Come on then.
                         
          Just as Vronsky is about to bow, she takes Oblonsky's arm and he whirls
          her away. Kitty smiles for Vronsky but his eyes have followed Anna, know-
          ing she cut him. He remembers himself after an awkward hiatus. Kitty's
          mother and father are watching from afar. Vronsky obliges. He invites her
          into the waltz.PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY. . . this vile, idiotic matchmaking of
           yours . . .PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKYFor goodness' sake, what have I done?PRINCE SHCHERBATSKYLevin is a thousand times better than this
           Petersburg fop. If he had royal blood my
           daughter wouldn't need him!
                         
          Vronsky's mind is absent and the waltz ends after only a few steps. He
          stand waiting for the music to start.KITTYIs anything the matter?50VRONSKYNo. You look . . . as lovely as ever, Princess
           Kitty.
                         
          The music starts and they dance on.
                         
          At the end of the waltz, Vronsky leaves Kitty with her mother, bows and
          departs. Princess Shcherbatsky is beginning to have doubts. She starts to ask.KITTY(SHARPLY)Don't ask me, Maman!
                         
          Boris the Youth pops up to claim his dance. Dancing, Kitty sees Vronsky
          talking to a couple of Officers. She is anxious but not disillusioned.
                         
          Grumpy Prince Shcherbatsky is dancing with Countess Nordston.COUNTESS NORDSTONHe'll dance the mazurka with Kitty, you'll
           see. I call the mazurka the now-or-never.
                         
          Anna watches the dancing. She rejects an offer with a smile. She sees Vron-
          sky and to her discomfort Vronsky looks up and catches her looking.
                         
          She turns away at once, and notices that ladies are curtseying and men are
          bowing as the Host and Hostess escort an overweight but glittering young
          couple towards a decorative buffet in an adjoining salon: the Austrian
          royal honeymooners . . . attended by the Guards Officer from the station.
          Anna stands and curtseys as they pass by into the salon . . . where Oblonsky
          is roaring with laughter, champagne in hand.AUSTRIAN PRINCESS. . . we were shut up in the train for an hour!51Anna steals a sidelong glance towards Vronsky but he is no longer there.
          She looks for him among the dancers, smiles at Kitty going by with the
          enthusiastic, inexpert Boris.
                         
          Suddenly, Vronsky is at Anna's side.VRONSKYDance with me.ANNA(CALMLY)I am not used to being spoken to like that
           by a man I met once at a railway station.VRONSKYI dare say, but if I'm not to dance with you,
           I'm getting out of this operetta and going
           home.ANNAThen, for Kitty's sake.
                         
          She gives him her hand.
                         
          Kitty looks for Vronsky, can't see him, then is taken aback to see him with
          Anna. Kitty watches Anna dancing. Anna says something which makes
          Vronsky laugh. Anna laughs. Anna blossoms in front of Kitty's eyes. Vron-
          sky twirls Anna around and she comes smiling into his arms.
                         
          It goes on like that. Kitty watches them from within the arms of young men,
          old men, from the wall. Anna and Vronsky dance slow, they dance fast,
          gaily, solemnly, gazes locked.
                         
          Others are noticing too: Countess Nordston, Princess Shcherbatsky, and
          eagle-eyed matrons. Anna, oblivious, has found a release in herself.52Countess Nordston finds Kitty sitting alone. Korsunsky announces the
          Mazurka.COUNTESS NORDSTONYou're not dancing the mazurka? I won't
           have it.
                         
          She pulls Kitty to her feet.

          The lady in the middle beckons to Anna and the man who, changing part-
          ners, happens to be dancing with her. They enter the middle where they
          have their solo turn as a couple, while the original couple reenter the circum-
          ference. Anna is flushed with pleasure. Among the surrounding dancers,
          Vronsky has no eyes for his partner, only for Anna. Kitty, dancing, watches
          Vronsky incredulous.KORSUNSKY (CONT'D)(ADDRESSING ANNA). . . and the lady chooses a lady and a
           gentleman . . . !53Anna looks smilingly around the dancing circle and sees Kitty staring
          at her. Anna "wakes up." Everything which made her drunk makes her
          sober in the instant. She waits until the change of partners brings Kitty
          and Vronsky together. She beckons them into the middle. Her own partner
          expects to re-join the circumference with Anna, but she makes an apology
          and escapes through the circle, running towards the door.
                         
          With a howl and clatter, the St. Petersburg express seems to crash through
          the ballroom.MONTAGEAn abstract, nightmarish, discordant noise of clattering and howling
          accompanies unexplained flame--light on wood, glass, iron . . . blackness
          opens like a door on a blizzard of light, and slams shut.
                         
          Anna's face, eyes closed, floats ghostlike.INT. TRAIN, SAME TIME--NIGHTAnna comes to consciousness in the dimly lit carriage, making sense of what
          seems like a hallucination. Wind and snow batter on the window. The
          Carriage Stoker, in long coat and cap, deals with the stove, clears frost off
          a thermometer on the wall. He leaves, opening the door to snow and wind
          and slamming it behind him.EXT. RUSSIA--NIGHTThe train "speeds" (35 m.p.h.) through a blizzard.54INT. THE TRAINAnna has a reading lamp hooked over her armrest, and a novel. She cuts
          a page with a paper-knife. But the book cannot hold her. She is reading
          without taking it in. She turns back a page and tries again, but almost at
          once she turns to the window where the dark reflection of her face looks back
          at her. Kitty's face staring as she stared at Anna, betrayed.
                         
          Anna turns away from the window. The Guard comes through the door,
          letting in wind and snow, and shuts it. He walks through the carriage.GUARDBologoye! Fifteen minutes.
                         
          The train is slowing.EXT. BOLOGOYE--NIGHTThe train clanks to a halt at a small station. Anna (and a few others)
          get down from the train. She wears a heavy cloak. The wind blows a few
          snowflakes through the station but the roof keeps off the snow. She is glad of
          the fresh air. Here and there, men are walking, smoking, laughing together.
          She feels better.
                         
          A tall outline of a man in a greatcoat and military cap emerges from the
          flickering gloom. She catches her breath. He salutes her.VRONSKYCan I be of service to you?ANNAI didn't know you were . . . Why are you
           leaving?55VRONSKYYou know why. I have to be where you are.
           I can't not.ANNAThis is wrong. If you're a good man, forget

           not a word, not a gesture--ANNAThat's enough!
                         
          She climbs the steps on to the porch. At the door to the carriage she pauses.
          The encounter has left her feeling elated and frightened.EXT. STATION, ST. PETERSBURG--DAYThe train arrives. Vronsky gets down from the train and starts to walk
          towards Anna's carriage. His German valet, Franz, runs up to him (from
          second class).VRONSKYTake the luggage home.
                         
          Franz runs back the other way. Vronsky walks on, then stops when he
          sees Karenin waiting on the platform, smiling and going forward to hand
          Anna down the steps. Kapitonich enters the carriage. Vronsky hesitates.ANNA(ANXIOUS)Is Serozha all right?56KARENINOh, is that all I get? Yes, he's quite well.
                         
          Vronsky steps forward. Anna knows he's there. She angles herself to avoid
          looking at him.VRONSKYDid you have a good night?
                         
          He bows to Karenin.ANNAYes, quite comfortable. Count Vronsky.
                         
          Karenin extends a hand indifferently then dismisses Vronsky, drawing
          Anna with him.KARENINI have to get back to the Committee . . .

          in an old apartment block.INT. VRONSKY'S FLAT, ST. PETERSBURG, SAMETIME--DAYVronsky rings the doorbell. A Servant opens the door. A male voice shouts

          that Vronsky isn't there. Betsy beckons to her across the room. Anna, self-
          possessed, smiling, nodding to friends, pressing a hand held out to her,
          offering the other hand to be kissed, glides through a crowd of Betsy's guests.VOICESWasn't Nilsson glorious? One sees that she

           surprise.
                         
          There is a series of minor explosions outside and the darkness out there turns
          into an illuminated garden lit by fountains of fire, sprays of light. The
          guests react with cries of pleasure and applause.72Anna turns at once to the window near her, puts her face up against the
          glass, putting her hands to her temples as if to see the illuminations better.REVERSEHer self-possessed face, lit by fireworks, falls apart in misery.

          acknowledges the congratulations and sycophancy which are her due. Foot-
          men come through the room with trays of ices.
                         
          Anna is still at the window, unaware that there is only darkness outside.
          In the room, Betsy notes the oddity: Anna alone with her back to the room.REVERSE ON ANNAAnna opens her eyes. She is lost for a moment, perplexed.

          picks up the two women's intimate laughter.
                         
          Karenin remains at apparent ease, as though unaware of people's glances
          at Vronsky and Anna, and he kisses Betsy's hand. Princess Myagkaya has
          meanwhile gone over to Anna. Anna likes her and is glad of the diversion.PRINCESS MYAGKAYASo the Schuzburgs asked us to dinner. The
           sauce was said to have cost a thousand rou-

           back. I gave them a sauce that cost eighty-
           five kopeks and it was a triumph.
                         
          Anna and Vronsky laugh. Princess Myagkaya moves on.VRONSKYWere you glad to see me or not?75ANNAThis must stop. You make me feel as if I
           were guilty of something.VRONSKYWhat do you want me to do?ANNAI want you to go to Moscow and beg Kitty
           to forgive you.VRONSKYNo, that's not what you want. Moscow? I
           can do better than that. Tonight I refused a

          An officer we don't know is, surprisingly, hailed as "Vronsky!"--he's

          hedges. It's a game. She is trying to find her way to him, chasing him. A
          hedge divides them. Serozha darts away from her, runs into a dead end,
          doubles back. She spots him, follows him, and now he has eluded her again.
                         
          Serozha finds his way out of the maze and is confronted by Karenin.KARENINHow are you, young man? Your tutor

          Anna returns to the house. She wipes her kissed hand on her skirt.EXT. THE RACES--DAYThis is a rough-and-ready racecourse but the venue for a high society occa-
          sion, with a grandstand for top people and a grander section, ornamented
          for greater comfort, for members of the Imperial family. It is also a fashion
          parade for some.
                         
          The racecourse itself is an oval approached by a straight. There are nine
          fences, water-jumps, etc., of various difficulty. The "jockeys" are officers in
          the Guards, the Hussars and other regiments.
                         
          Among them is Vronsky, attended by a Trainer who is fussing over Frou-
          Frou's bridle and calming her. Vronsky looks with interest at a big power-
          ful horse which must be Gladiator, with Captain Makhotin already in the
          saddle. Makhotin and Vronsky greet each other with a nod.100KARENIN-- arrives at the races . . . making his way towards the front, smiling,
          raising his hat to acquaintances . . . his eyes busy looking for his wife. He
          reaches the front and looks up at the Ladies' Stand.EXT. THE LADIES' STAND, THE RACES, SAME TIME--DAYAnna and Betsy are here, and, not far away, so are Countess Vronsky and
          the Princesses Sorokina: the mother is a fading fortyish; the daughter is
          eighteen, blonde and pretty.
                         
          Below the ladies section is a planked standing area for gentlemen, who also
          may stand to watch the races from the stepped aisle of the seated section.
          Soldiers, Horse People and Locals watch from the turf.
                         
          A race is flowing towards the winning post, with accompanying crowd reac-
          tion, but it is clear from Anna's detachment, exchanging chat with Betsy,
          that this is not Vronsky's race.KARENIN--looks up to the ladies' stand. Betsy smiles at him in greeting, but Anna
          seems unaware.
                         
          Countess Vronsky appraises the young princess.COUNTESS VRONSKYExquisite creature . . . you really ought to be
           the spoil of victory today . . .

          Post while the current race finishes to cheers.KARENIN, SMILING AROUND, WATCHES AS:--Anna's anxious attention turns to a horse and rider who fell further
          down the course-- and to the ambulance wagon (with a red cross sewn
          on it) . . .
                         
          Karenin mounts the steps of the aisle, raising his hat to ladies he knows.
          Anna ignores him.
                         
          On the wooden boards below, where gentlemen are watching, Oblonsky calls
          up to Betsy.OBLONSKYPrincess! A bet! What do you fancy in the
           next?BETSYKusolev.OBLONSKYI'm on Vronsky. A pair of gloves?102BETSYDone!(TO ANNA)Alexander Vronsky . . .

          Vronsky's brother Alexander, escorting his wife, Varya, bows to Anna and
          Betsy, but significantly Varya succeeds in not noticing them.EXT. STARTING POST, THE RACES, SAME TIME--DAYThe riders line up . . . and they're off.VRONSKY'S POVThe stands and spectators are distant, the first fence coming at him, horses
          on either side. His neighbour falls at the fence but Frou-Frou is clear, with
          Gladiator half a length in front. The next fence is coming up. Gladiator
          and Frou-Frou jump cleanly but a following horse falls badly.EXT. LADIES' STAND, THE RACES, SAME TIME--DAYSpectators on either side of Anna and those behind and in front collectively react.KARENIN SEES THAT:Anna reacts not at all. Her gaze through her glasses stays unwavering
          on Vronsky. Karenin notes this, and from then on his attention is fixed on
          Anna. When the horses come opposite the stand, she lowers her glasses and
          follows Frou-Frou taking the lead from Gladiator.103VRONSKY-- eases Frou-Frou past Gladiator. The horses take the next jump.LADIES' STANDWith one hand Anna grips her folded fan.
                         
          Karenin's face is a mask as he watches Anna unconsciously half-destroying
          it. She raises her glasses.ANNA'S POV THROUGH GLASSESFrou-Frou approaches the last fence with Gladiator half a length behind,
          on the near side to Anna.VRONSKY-- working the reins, rising and falling in rhythm with the horse, looks
          ahead to the winning post, and before knowing it he makes an error, losing
          the rhythm, dropping back into the saddle and raising the horse's head, just
          as Frou-Frou takes off.ANNA'S POV (THROUGH GLASSES)Frou-Frou rises, Gladiator rises. Frou-Frou disappears. Gladiator clears
          the fence in Anna's foreground. Simultaneously, there are shrieks and
          exclamations all around her-- OFF CAMERA-- and the view through
          the glasses zigzags in search of Frou-Frou, impeded by horses jumping the
          fence.104She lowers the glasses and sees Frou-Frou on the ground, rolling over, and
          Vronsky on the ground.COUNTESS VRONSKY-- sees this, too, her mouth set tight with contempt.KARENIN--looks shocked. Almost in the same moment he hears Anna's anguished
          cry, conspicuous in the hubbub that follows the crowd's exclamation.ANNAAlexei . . . !KARENINI'm here.
                         
          This is adroit. He comes down several steps and pushes through to offer his arm,
          but Anna has lost control, trying to escape like a bird beating against its cage.KARENIN (CONT'D)Would you like to leave?
                         
          Anna ignores him, puts her glasses to her eyes, searching out Vronsky.ON THE COURSEVronsky extricates himself from his broken horse and, in terrible recrimina-
          tion, tries to pull Frou-Frou to her feet by the reins. Frou-Frou struggles
          to get up but her back is broken. Officials, officers, and a doctor have come
          running.105ANNA. . . sees an Officer hurrying to the Imperial party to report.ANNAStiva! What are they saying?OBLONSKYVronsky's unhurt--but the horse . . .

          fan. Betsy gives Anna her fan.VRONSKY--is restrained by an Officer.OFFICERHer back's broken!

          A gunshot is heard from the course. Anna turns her tear-streaked face
          towards it.INT. MOVING COACH--DAYAnna's hysteria has solidified into a blank despair. Karenin seems to want
          to pretend that nothing important has happened.KARENINYou know . . . they say the Emperor dis-

          Karenin changes tack.KARENINI have to tell you--ANNAYes.KARENINI have to tell you, you behaved improperly
           today.ANNAAnd how was that?
                         
          She has raised her voice. He raises a warning finger, and reaches to close the
          communication window behind the coachman's box.KARENINBy making plain your feelings when one of
           the riders fell. Your conduct was improper.
           It must not occur again. I have said it before.
                         
          Anna smiles faintly. He is misled by that.108KARENIN (CONT'D)You are going to say my concern is unneces-
           sary and ridiculous. You are my wife. I am
           wrong to think that . . . yes--perhaps I was
           mistaken.
                         
          Anna looks at him despairingly.ANNANo, you were not mistaken. I love him. I
           am his mistress. I can't bear you, I'm afraid
           of you, I hate you. Do what you like to me.
                         
          Karenin is literally winded--gasping for breath, slowly getting his breath-
          ing under control. Anna huddles away from him in her corner. Karenin
          recovers himself only to the point of sitting stock-still, looking at nothing,
          not moving.
                         
          The coach lurches, unbalancing him so that he is pushed against Anna. He
          recoils as if from a contamination.
                         
          The coach slows. The coach stops. A Servant comes to the coach door, opens
          the door.KARENINWait, please. Move away.
                         
          The Servant backs off.KARENIN (CONT'D)I will not have a scandal. Therefore . . . You
           will not see . . . this man again. You will
           behave in such a way that nothing is known

           In return, you will keep the privileges of a109wife--and the duties. Tomorrow you will
           return home. That is all.
                         
          Anna gets out of the coach and runs into the maze.EXT. MAZE--NIGHTAnna comes to Vronsky. She is still shaken by the showdown with
          Karenin in his coach, but is now overtaken by concern for Vronsky after his
          fall.ANNAAre you hurt?
                         
          Vronsky shakes his head. He is moved by the sight of her, full of love and
          desire, but in her embrace he detects something new, a nervous exaltation.VRONSKYWhat's happened?ANNAI told him I'm your mistress.
                         
          Vronsky lifts her face, strokes her cheek. He waits.ANNA (CONT'D)He thinks I can give you up and go on
           living.
                         
          He embraces her for that, relieved, grateful, loving--understanding that
          she is not going to give him up.110VRONSKYNo, you cannot.INT. (ST. PETERSBURG)--NIGHTImperial hands (the Tsar's for all we know) place over Karenin's head a

          Karenin stares at her. He turns back to the open drawer and puts things
          back the way they were. He locks the drawer. He puts on his dressing gown
          and leaves the room. Anna waits a moment and follows him.INT. SITTING ROOM, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME--NIGHTIt's dark. Anna hears the crack of his knuckles and can see him faintly,

          CLOSER--Levin is suffering but keeping up, bathed in perspiration. His
          place is behind an old man, Theodore, who is scything as if without effort.
          Just in time for Levin, Theodore calls a halt and takes Levin's scythe to
          sharpen it with a whetstone. Levin attracts a few grins and comments.113YOUNG PEASANTKonstantin Dmitrich, you'll know your
           rows when the field's all done!
                         
          Levin's row has stalks of differing heights between the even swathes on
          either side. There is some laughter, but the men are uneasy.EXT. HAYMAKING (KASHIN)-- SUNDOWNIt's time to stop for the day. More tomorrow. The Mowers with their scythes
          walk back across the large meadow of cut swathes. From the other direc-
          tion, a crowd of Village Women are coming to meet them carrying food and
          drink.EXT. HAYMAKING (KASHIN)--DUSKA fire has been lit. The Mowers eat their meal in the company of women.
          Serafina tends to a cooking pot in the firelight. Levin watches her discreetly.
          He has settled down at a discreet distance from the men. His attention
          is caught by a grown-up Boy and his young Wife who have chosen to sit
          slightly apart. He is charmed by them, watching the girl serve her husband.
                         
          Theodore comes to Levin with a jug. Levin takes a swig.LEVINHow many mowers is it, Theodore?THEODOREForty-two, master. In your father's time it
           was work for two days for thirty men . . .(SLYLY). . . though he never picked up a scythe

           living simply that I'm looking for?EXT. HAYMAKING (KASHIN)--NIGHTNight under the stars. Some of the men have gone, some have settled in for
          the night. The cooking fire is burning out. Levin remains where he was,
          watching, thinking: drawn to "the simple life."EXT. HAYMAKING (KASHIN)--DAWNLevin wakes . . . woken by hoofbeats and the jingle of harness.
                         
          Levin sees a coach coming towards him. The coach comes nearer, leather
          boxes strapped to the roof.
                         
          Levin sees that a young woman is looking out of the side window, holding
          on to the white ribbons of her bonnet. He sees that it is Kitty, on her way to
          Ergoshovo. (Princess Shcherbatsky is also inside, dozing.)
                         
          The coach passes on, leaving Levin lovelorn, the dawn light on him. The
          sight of Kitty has turned him round again.116INT. STATION, ST PETERSBURG--DAYAUTUMNVronsky stands at the entrance to the platform holding a bouquet, waiting
          for a train. He looks pretty fed up.INT. "FRENCH THEATRE," ST. PETERSBURG--NIGHTAs before, the set-up is a small stage, a small auditorium, and an area for
          drinking, cruising, etc., a combination of music hall and a bar with a few
          tables. Vronsky is here as the escort of a Foreign Prince (an Indian), watch-
          ing a "risquï¿½" show with Can-Can Girls, much relished by the visitor.
                         
          Vronsky's glance casts about in the gloom. The champagne is flowing. Vron-
          sky spots a trio--Lisa Merkalova, Betsy, and Stremov, a politician and
          Karenin's rival.
                         
          Vronsky catches Betsy's eye. She beckons him. He excuses himself to the
          Foreign Prince, who doesn't notice, and goes over to the other table. Under
          the music, he is introduced to Stremov, and kisses the hands of the women.

          is applauding enthusiastically when Vronsky rejoins him.STREMOV(SMIRKS)I only say that a man who can't govern his

          approaches the door, it opens and Kapitonich comes out with a folded rug.
          Kapitonich is wrong-footed by seeing him. Karenin comes out of the door,
          into the gaslight. When he sees Vronsky he hesitates for a fraction but con-
          tinues. Kapitonich is holding open the door of the coach. Vronsky bows,
          Karenin, expressionless, touches his hat and gets into the coach, taking the
          rug. Vronsky walks into the house as the coach moves off.INT. ENTRANCE HALL, KARENIN HOUSE, SAMETIME--NIGHTKapitonich comes in, closing the door. Vronsky gives him his hat and coat.KAPITONICHGood evening, Your Excellency.

          Karenin finds an iron bootjack. Anna tries to stop him. He pushes
          her aside and smashes the wood around the lock, then, struggling against her,
          he takes from the open drawer a pretty cardboard box, a good guess. He
          confirms that it contains letters.123KARENIN (CONT'D)I am going to Moscow tomorrow, and

          Levin is nettled to find that he seems to have made a joke, for the Countess
          especially. Kitty remains serious, watching Levin, loving him.LEVIN (CONT'D)An impure love is not love, to me. To admire
           another man's wife is a pleasant thing, but
           sensual desire indulged for its own sake is
           greed, a kind of gluttony, and a misuse of
           something sacred which is given to us so
           that we may choose the one person with
           whom to fulfill our humanness. Otherwise
           we might as well be cattle.COUNTESS NORDSTONAh, an idealist!
                         
          Reconciliatory laughter eases the atmosphere. Levin feels abashed at coming
          out of his shell. He steals a glance at Kitty and finds her looking at him.
          She smiles at him and drops her eyes.INT. RECEPTION ROOM, OBLONSKY HOUSE--NIGHTThe dinner party settles in.

          and comes up the stairs to her. She sees that he is holding her note.MICHAELCount Vronsky had already left, Your Excel-
           lency. He took a cab to the station . . . to the
           Countess.INT. LOCAL TRAIN--DAYAnna clutches her red bag to her, sitting among passengers.
                         
          Anna looks about her. Across the carriage she sees through the window that
          her train is overtaking another passenger train on the next line.
                         
          She looks at the windows of the other train "going by" . . . seeing the pas-
          sengers inside.
                         
          Unexpectedly, she seems to see a Man who might be Vronsky sitting opposite
          a laughing Woman who might be Princess Sorokina.191Anna's body jerks involuntarily. She half rises. The image, however, is
          brief and is borne away, as her own train goes by, accelerating. The win-
          dows opposite pick up speed as she leaves them behind--
                         
          And then she has the same illusion again-- a "Vronsky" and a "Sorokina"
          glimpsed in the other train and snatched away in the instant.
                         
          Now she stands up and goes to the opposite window, where the windows
          of the other train are flashing by in the (anachronistic) manner of pro-
          jected film-frames, and she sees "Vronskys" and "Sorokinas" flashing by at
          gathering speed. And then the train has gone and there's nothing going by
          but the view.
                         
          Anna collapses into the nearest seat.EXT. LOCAL STATION, SAME TIME--DAYThe train arrives at a small station.
                         
          Anna steps down from the train. The platform is well populated by people
          waiting to board the train or to meet the arriving passengers. There is an
          energy about the people-- shouting, laughter, movement. Porters shout for
          custom. A couple of Young Men seem to be laughing rudely directly at her,
          but they pass by, ignoring her.
                         
          Anna pauses, bewildered, lost, not knowing what to do next.
                         
          She sees the Sorokina Coachman on the platform, recognising his distinctive
          livery, a cockade in his hat.ANNAAre you waiting for the Princess Sorokina?192COACHMANNo, Your Excellency, both princesses are at
           the house of Countess Vronsky. I'm waitingFOR HIM--Anna turns back, agitated, expecting Vronsky to appear, but what comes
          is a Footman carrying three hatboxes and a large box from a dress shop.
                         
          Anna walks away, along the platform, impeded by people going by her,
          aware that some are staring at her as she passes. A Boy selling drinks grins
          at her. A little group of Ladies and Children meeting a bespectacled man
          off the train are laughing and chattering but fall silent and look at her. She
          increases her pace. She hurries away towards the far end of the platform.
          Beyond her, a goods train is slowly approaching. Between her and the train,
          two Maidservants are walking towards her. They turn their heads to look
          at her, remarking on her dress.MAIDSERVANTLook at that lace on her . . .
                         
          There is a rough bench near the end of the platform. Anna reaches it and
          sits down. The two girls turn again to look back at her, and are struck
          by the sight of Anna sitting alone in profile. The goods train reaches her
          and the first wagon goes past her. The two girls stop and watch, vaguely
          puzzled by her.
                         
          As they watch, the beautiful woman on the bench gets up and walks the
          few steps to the edge of the wooden platform and into the path of the train,
          disappearing from view between the wheels of one of the wagons.EXT. (POKROVSKOE)--DAYCLOSE--A SCYTHE CUTS A SWATHE THROUGHSTANDING HAY.193EXT. RAILS--THE RED HANDBAG--lying separate against a rail, is clipped by a rolling train-wheel and

          known from last year. He is one of a dozen Mowers. Levin is among them,
          wielding his scythe. They have almost reached the end of the field, where the
          last of the hay is being pitchforked up on to the last piled cart. Theodore's
          daughter-in-law, now visibly pregnant, is still adept with a pitchfork.
                         
          It's a lowering thundery day at the end of summer.LEVINI'll be buying in feed before winter's over.THEODORE(SCYTHING)Well, you don't press people hard, but you
           live rightly, for your soul, not your belly.LEVINMy soul! What's that? I know what my

           Dmitrich, but what's rightly is outside your

          This stops Levin's scythe. He is illumined.
                         
          Theodore swings the scythe again. Levin walks away, gives his scythe to a
          Labourer by the cart, and keeps walking. He quickens his pace.EXT. POKROVSKOE--DAYThe first drops of rain, few and heavy, arrive.EXT. HOUSE AND PORCH, POKROVSKOE, SAMETIME--DAYCries of alarm and laughter burst from a Mushrooming Party approaching
          the house. Children run ahead, the adults walk faster, then run, helping
          with baby carriages and picking up small children and baskets of mush-
          rooms . . . urged on from the porch by Agafia.
                         
          Levin, coming from the hay field, joins the rout.195The grown-ups are: Levin, Oblonsky, Dolly, the Oblonsky Nurse, Prince
          and Princess Shcherbatsky.
                         
          The children are: Tanya, Grisha, Masha, Lili and Vasili. Dolly carries
          her youngest. The children are eighteen months older than when we first
          saw them.PORCHThe heavens open as everyone gets under cover.LEVINWhere's Ekaterina Alexandrovna?AGAFIAIt's all right, the mistress is giving Mitya
           his bath.
                         
          It is evident from her tone that Kitty and Agafia have made it up long ago.INT. NURSERY, POKROVSKOE, SAME TIME--DAYRain on the window and on the roof. The rain is so loud that it is the
          foreground sound in the scene; and the dialogue, while we can pick it out
          without difficulty, is the background sound.
                         
          Levin enters, wet.
                         
          Dmitri (Mitya), two months old, is lying on his back in a basin, supported
          by Kitty's palm under his head. Kitty squeezes a sponge over his body,
          which he likes.196LEVINI came looking for you . . . I understood
           something . . .KITTYAnd what was that?
                         
          Kitty lifts Mitya onto a towel on her lap, wraps him and gives him to
          Levin, who is enchanted by him.LEVINHe smiled at me.KITTY(UNCONSCIOUSLY ABSURD)He's very advanced for his age.
                         
          She picks up her rings to replace them on her fingers.KITTY (CONT'D)What did you understand?
                         
          But the baby starts to yell for the breast. Kitty starts to undo her blouse.
                         
          Levin shakes his head: he'll tell her some other time, or maybe not.EXT. PORCH, POKROVSKOE--NIGHTThe storm has passed. Everything drips.
                         
          Oblonsky comes from inside and lights a cigar. Indistinctly seen and heard
          through the window, the Mushrooming Party occupies the dining room.
          Oblonsky smokes thoughtfully, melancholy.197EXT. FLOWERING MEADOW--DAYSPRINGTIMEBaby Anya, old enough to stagger on her feet, wavers through wild flowers
          half her height. She falls over, almost disappearing.
                         
          This is being watched, with a mixture more pleasure than pain, by Kar-
          enin. He is in early retirement, sitting with a book in a garden seat, dressed
          comfortably under a straw hat. There is the SOUND OVER of people
          playing croquet.
                         
          Serozha, aged ten, enters his view, going to Anya to haul her upright, and
          keeping hold of her hand as she staggers on. Karenin's pleasure increases
          slightly.
                         
          OVER this, the growing SOUND of a battlefield.EXT. BATTLEFIELD (BALKANS)--DAYCLOSEVronsky, in an unfamiliar uniform, sabre pointing forward, is mounted at
          full gallop with the SOUND of the charge all around him in the smoke and
          noise of guns. Something heavy and invisible with its own SOUND--like
          the flap of an awning--takes him from his horse into the air and gone,
          leaving spouts of blood poised for an instant in the smoke.EXT. FLOWERING MEADOW, AS BEFORENATURAL SOUND198Serozha picks up Anya like a parcel under his arm and walks on with her
