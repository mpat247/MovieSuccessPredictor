                   Eric Bergren, Christopher De Vore & Nicholas KazanPROLOGUEBLACK. We HEAR the soft voice of Frances Farmer.FRANCES (V.O.)No one ever came up to me and said, 
                         'You're a fool. There isn't such a 
                         thing as God. Somebody's been stuffing 
                         you.'FADE IN:EXT. PUGET SOUND - DAYOn an expanse of water, calm and undisturbed. After a moment, 
               it begins to ripple as something rises toward the surface. A 
               girl's face breaks through.FRANCES (V.O.)It wasn't a murder. I think God just 
                         died of old age. And when I realized 
                         He wasn't any more, it didn't shock 
                         me. It seemed natural and right.

               The girl, FRANCES, is 16, blond, very pretty: she seems like 
               the most persuasive proof imaginable of God's existence. She 
               swims toward the shore with long graceful strokes... then 
               climbs the steps of the old wood jetty on West Point Beach.FRANCES (V.O.)And yet I began to wonder what the 
                         minister meant when he said, 'God, 
                         the Father, sees even the smallest 
                         sparrow fall. He watches over all 
                         his children.' That jumbled it all 
                         up for me.EXT. PUGET SOUND - LATERThe banks of Puget Sound, dotted with elm trees. Frances 
               sits comfortably in the fork of a tree writing in her diary. 
               Towel around her neck, her hair splayed out and drying golden 
               in the sun.FRANCES (V.O.)But still sometimes I found that God 
                         was useful to remember, especially 
                         when I lost things that were 
                         important. 'Please God, let me find 
                         my red hat with the blue trimmings.'INT. FARMER HOME - FAMILY ROOM - EVENINGFrances is now reading aloud from her diary, gently swaying 
               back and forth in a rocking chair. An older woman, LILLIAN 
               FARMER, sits opposite on the couch, listening and nodding 
               from time to time. A small suitcase stands by the front door.FRANCESIt usually worked. God became a 
                         superfather that couldn't spank me. 
                         But if I wanted a thing badly enough, 
                         He arranged it.

               ERNEST FARMER appears in the doorway and hesitates, listening 
               to his daughter read.FRANCESBut if God loved all of His children 
                         equally, why did He bother about my 
                         red hat and let other people lose 
                         their fathers and mothers for always?

               Ernest goes to Frances and kisses her softly on the top of 
               her head. She looks at him briefly, smiling slightly.ERNESTBye, baby.FRANCESSee you next weekend, Dad.

               He goes to the door and picks up his suitcase, glances at 
               Lillian. She doesn't look up. He leaves.FRANCESI began to see that He didn't have 
                         much to do about hats or people dying 
                         or anything. They happened whether 
                         He wanted them to or not, and He 
                         stayed in Heaven and pretended not 
                         to notice.DISSOLVE TO:INT. AUDITORIUM - DAYFrances stands at a podium. Other STUDENTS and TEACHERS sit 
               to either side of her on folding chairs. Above the proscenium 
               is engraved: West Seattle High School. Below that a banner 
               hangs: "NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL ESSAY COMPETITION, 1931."FRANCESI wondered a little why God was such 
                         a useless thing. It seemed a waste 
                         of time to have Him. After that He 
                         became less and less, until He was... 
                         nothingness.

               The AUDIENCE consists of parents, students, and local 
               dignitaries. We SEE several shocked faces. Lillian is there 
               also, smiling. Seated next to her is a distinguished-looking 
               woman, ALMA STYLES. Ernest sits on the other side of the 
               auditorium, looking a little worried.FRANCESI felt rather proud that I had found 
                         the truth myself, without help from 
                         anyone. It puzzled me that other 
                         people hadn't found out, too. God 
                         was gone. We had reached past Him. 
                         Why couldn't they see it? It still 
                         puzzles me.

               Frances closes her notebook and looks up, waiting for some 
               response. There is a deep shocked silence, then a smattering 
               of applause. Lillian claps enthusiastically, then rises to 
               her feet. In the back a WOMAN also stands.WOMANYou're going straight to hell, Frances 
                         Farmer!

               A stately man sitting next to her, her husband JUDGE BENJAMIN 
               HILLIER, puts a restraining hand on her arm. The woman 
               continues to glare at Frances.

               Frances stares back, dumbfounded.SMASH CUT TO:EXT. SEATTLE STREETS - DAYThe screen erupts into violence. A large unruly MOB skirmishes 
               with POLICE in a cobblestoned square. On a truckbed addressing 
               the crowd -- which carries placards reading: "Organize Now!", 
               "Workers of the World Unite!", and "Elect Kaminski!" stands 
               MARTONI KAMINSKI. By his side, leading the crowd's responses, 
               stands a younger man with sharp piercing eyes, HARRY YORK.KAMINSKIAnd do you think it's radical for a 
                         man to have a job and feed a family?YORK & CROWDNo!KAMINSKIIs it radical for you to have a hand 
                         in shaping your future, and the future

               The crowd cheers. Harry York gives Kaminski the thumbs-up 
               sign as a banner unfurls: "Today Seattle -- Tomorrow the 
               World."FADE TO BLACK:FADE IN:A TITLE COMES ON SCREEN: GOD'S IN HIS HEAVEN AND ALL'S RIGHTWITH THE WORLD? 'NOT SO!' SAYS YOUNG FRANCES FARMERWe realize we've been watching a newsreel. We SEE the SCHOOL

               Among the AUDIENCE in the cinema, we SEE Frances and her 
               father. Frances slinks down in her seat until she's hidden 
               from sight.EXT. SUBURBAN STREET (SEATTLE) - DAYFrances carries library books and a small grocery bag. Her 
               hair and skin gleam in the sun. People in their yards stare 
               at her as she passes. She walks on, coming to a group of 
               CHILDREN slightly younger than herself who are playing in 
               front of a union hall. A girl, EMMA, 13, glances up.FRANCESHi Emma.

               Emma looks away quickly, returns to her play.FRANCESBye Emma.

               Frances shakes her head as she walks on.MAN'S VOICEHey!

               Frances hesitates, then turns to look:

               A man in his twenties whom we recognize as Harry York, 
               Kaminski's compatriot, leaves a group of men in front of the 
               union hall and walks toward her.HARRY(friendly)

               Harry laughs.HARRYThat's rich. Hey, if I was a cop,

               Frances hesitates, leans toward him as though about to frisk 
               him. Their eyes meet, and she pulls away, suddenly

               car, seated beside the outline of a familiar mustached figure.

               hurls her down again and manages to get the cuffs on. As

               Frances' face appears at the tiny barred window. We can just 
               hear her:FRANCESI love you, Harry. I love you.HARRYI love you too, Frances.

               Behind Frances we HEAR the Women screaming: "I love you, 
               Harry!" The Doctor takes Harry's arm and pulls him down the 
               corridor.INT. WARD - NIGHTFrances turns to face the women in their cots. Collects 
               herself. Looks repentant. She is practicing tomorrow's speech.FRANCESI realize now that I was a very sick

               The others laugh. We realize that if Frances can handle this, 
               she can sail through it tomorrow. The catcalls gradually 
               diminish as she concludes her speech.FRANCESAnd I was not taking responsibility 
                         for my actions. But now, thanks to

                         myself, ready to resume the career

               A car pulls up. Frances kisses Ernest on the cheek and gets 
               out. As he drives off, she walks into the yard and looks 
               around, heaves a sigh; she's home. Then Christmas lights 
               spring on over the porch. Lillian comes out grinning broadly, 
               followed by REPORTERS. Frances blanches.INT. FARMER HOUSE - DAYFrances sits on the couch next to Lillian. They're sipping

               She touches it shyly. It's swept up in a continental style.FRANCESWell, I like to try different styles.

                         enough, you find you're modern. Right,

               kitchen.LILLIANOh, just leave those things for now.FRANCESNo, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll

                         I hope so, Frances.

               the contact were too much.FRANCES(disentangling)

               He turns and walks slowly to his car.EXT. HIGHWAY - DAWNBarren desert. The middle of nowhere. A lone male HITCHHIKER, 
               poor, stands at a crossroads. A car coming the wrong direction 
               raises dust along the highway. It slows, stops, and lets 
               Frances out. She is now dressed in jeans and a workshirt. 
               She has a heavy tan.

               She glances across at the Hitchhiker and nods casually. He 
               responds in kind. A relaxed silence follows. Two strangers 
               passing. His voice, when he speaks, is gentle, calm:HITCHHIKERPretty morning.FRANCES(nods)

               She stops. She sees now that the car heading toward her is a 
               cop car. She averts her face... then tries to hide her 
               gesture.HITCHHIKERWhat's the matter?

               Frances sighs as the cop car speeds away.HITCHHIKERThey're looking for you, huh?

               She's uncertain whether to trust him. Takes the plunge:FRANCESYeah.HITCHHIKERWhat'd you do?FRANCESYou know, I've never been able to 
                         figure that out.

               He laughs. She shivers slightly, pulls her clothes around 
               her. He takes out a small flask and offers, no strings:HITCHHIKERI've got a little whiskey here, warm 
                         you up.

               She smiles, truly grateful:FRANCESThank you.

               Then she sees a ball of dust nearing... a car on his side.FRANCESWait. Maybe they'll pick you up.

               The car stops. Its lights flashing. COPS jump out.FRANCESShit!HITCHHIKERRun!

               She does. She's pursued. The Hitchhiker makes an effort to 
               impede the Cops' progress, but is tossed aside. The Cops are 
               slowly, inevitably, gaining on her.EXT. SMALL TOWN JAIL - DAYFrances and Ernest walk out the door followed by a portly

               Ernest writhes slightly with discomfort.ERNESTFrancie, you know I can't do that.FRANCESWhy? It's such a simple thing. You

               hair cropped very short. The walls are corrugated tin nailed 
               to bare wood framing. The place looks like an enormous tool 
               shed. The SOUND OF GARBLED VOICES and SCREAMING never stops. 

               These are the forgotten ones... beyond hope. Everyone here 
               has lost any notion of what they might have once been. Their 
               faces are slack, only their eyes glow with an animal ferocity. 
               Some wander aimlessly about, unheeding of others who are 
               pushing, kicking and screaming at them. Many squat in the 
               dirt by the walls, mired in their own urine and excrement, 
               chanting wordlessly to themselves. Some appear lifeless, 
               their prone bodies shoved out of the way. Some women are 
               involved in violent sex with themselves or each other, some 
               in mindless fist-fights. In a far corner we SEE a group of 
               men in various military and medical uniforms, their backs to 
               us, facing the wall, grouped around something. We HEAR their 
               cheering and laughing and joking, slapping each other on the 
               back.

               We SLOWLY MOVE CLOSER and can see over their shoulders the 
               object of their hilarity. It's Frances, lying naked and spread-
               eagled on the floor. Four hospital ATTENDANTS pin her arms 
               and legs. A SOLDIER, his pants down around his ankles, is 
               squirming violently on top of her. Frances' eyes are open 
               but glazed, her face turned away from her attacker. She is 
               passive and unresisting. She is reciting to herself, over 
               and over.FRANCESWe shall hear the angels, we shall 
                         see the whole sky all diamonds...

                         beneath the eyelid and presses up 
                         into the prefrontal lobe, manipulating 
                         it so as to sever the nervous 
                         connections between the thalamofrontal 
                         radiation and the body of the brain.

               The lights are bright, on her and the other patients. We 
               cannot see, but we sense, an audience watching.DR. HARLINGTON (O.S.)Because of the speed and simplicity 
                         of the operation, I am able, as you 
                         are seeing, to perform the procedure 
                         on ten patients in less than a half 
                         hour.

               Frances stares up at a fan in the ceiling. It's moving round 
               and round. The voice drones on.DR. HARLINGTON (O.S.)The operation is completely painless 
                         and can be performed without any 
                         sedative whatsoever.

               We now see vaguely that DR. HARLINGTON has moved to the 
               patient on the adjacent gurney.DR. HARLINGTONWe have always known that this form 
                         of radical treatment was effective, 
                         but until now it couldn't be applied 
                         on a large scale. The old procedure 
                         required a full day's work by a 
                         surgical team to perform a single 
                         operation. In the same time, working 
                         alone, I can treat fifty.

               Frances turns and stares mutely, without emotion, at what's 
               happening next to her: the leucotome (an ice-pick-like 
               instrument) is inserted into a woman's eye socket...DR. HARLINGTONThis procedure works best on patients 
                         with extreme over-reactions to 
                         emotional stimuli. It can also be 
                         used as a last resort on those who 
                         seem impervious to other forms of 
                         treatment.

               The leucotome is then shoved up into the brain and twisted.DR. HARLINGTONIn plain language, my technique severs 
                         the nerves which give emotional energy 
                         to ideas. Along with the cure comes 
                         a loss of affect... a kind of 
                         emotional flattening...

               Frances turns away and stares at the fan again. There is 
               something simple and pleasing about its rhythmic whirring...DR. HARLINGTON...with diminished creativity and 
                         imagination. Patients become like 
                         good solid cake with no icing. But, 
                         after all, it is their emotions and 
                         imaginations that are disturbed.

               We glimpse the leucotome being withdrawn.DR. HARLINGTONThese patients will soon be leaving 
                         the hospital.
