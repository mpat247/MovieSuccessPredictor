sixteen, with dark, intense eyes.JANEI need a father who's a role model, not

          What a lame-o. Somebody really should put
          him out of his misery.

Her mind wanders for a beat.RICKY (O.C.)Want me to kill him for you?

LESTER BURNHAM lies sleeping amidst expensive bed linens,
face down, wearing PAJAMAS. An irritating ALARM CLOCK RINGS.
Lester gropes blindly to shut it off.LESTER (V.O.)Of course, I don't know that yet. He
          rolls over, looks up at us and sighs. He
          doesn't seem too thrilled at the prospect
          of a new day.(CONTINUED)2.CONTINUED:LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)And in a way, I'm dead already.

with CLIPPERS appears and SNIPS the flower off.

CAROLYN BURNHAM tends her rose bushes in front of the Burnham
house. A very well-put together woman of forty, she wears
color-coordinated gardening togs and has lots of useful and
expensive tools.

Lester watches her through a WINDOW on the first floor,
peeping out through the drapes.LESTER (V.O.)That's my wife Carolyn. See the way the
          handle on those pruning shears matches
          her gardening clogs? That's not an
          accident.EXT. JIMS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUSIn the fenced front yard of the house next door, a dog BARKS
repeatedly. A MAN in a conservative suit (JIM #1) chastises
the barking dog.JIM #1Hush, Bitsy. You hush. What is wrong?LESTER (V.O.)That's our next-door neighbor Jim.

house.(CONTINUED)3.CONTINUED:LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)And that's his lover, Jim.JIM #2(re: barking dog)

          I just love your tie! That color!JIM #1I just love your roses. How do you get
          them to flourish like this?CAROLYNWell, I'll tell you. Egg shells and
          Miracle Grow.

Jim #1 and Carolyn continue to chat, unaware that Lester is
watching them.LESTER (V.O.)Man. I get exhausted just watching her.

Lester's POV: We can't hear what Jim and Carolyn are saying,
but she's overly animated, like a TV talk show host.LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)She wasn't always like this. She used to
          be happy. We used to be happy.4.INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUSJANE is seated at her desk, working at her computer.LESTER (V.O.)My daughter Jane. Only child.

CLOSE on the COMPUTER MONITOR: A PERSONAL BANKING SOFTWARE
window suddenly disappears to reveal another window: a
PLASTIC SURGERY WEBSITE, featuring clinical "before" and
"after" photos of surgically augmented breasts.LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)Janie's a pretty typical teenager. Angry,
          insecure, confused. I wish I could tell
          her that's all going to pass...

Outside, a CAR HORN BLARES. Jane stuffs items into herBACKPACK.LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)But I don't want to lie to her.

We HEAR the CAR HORN again from outside. Jane studies herself
in a mirror, then shifts to get a good profile of her
breasts.EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUSCarolyn stands next to a platinum-colored MERCEDES-BENZ
ML320, reaching in through the drivers' window to blow the
HORN again.

Jane shuffles out of the house, her backpack slung over her
shoulder.CAROLYNJane. Honey. Are you trying to look
          unattractive?JANEYes.CAROLYNWell, congratulations. You've succeeded
          admirably.

Jane gets in the car. Lester hurries out the front door,
carrying a BRIEFCASE.(CONTINUED)5.CONTINUED:CAROLYN (CONT'D)Lester, could you make me a little later,
          please? Because I'm not quite late
          enough.

Lester's briefcase suddenly springs open and his papers spill
all over the driveway. He drops to his knees to gather
everything.JANENice going, Dad.

Lester smiles sheepishly, trying to lighten the moment.

His POV: Carolyn looks down at us, contemptuous but also
bored, as if she gave up expecting anything more long ago.LESTER (V.O.)Both my wife and daughter think I'm this
          gigantic loser, and... they're right.INT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - A SHORT TIME LATERCarolyn is driving; Jane stares out the window. Lester is
asleep in the back seat.LESTER (V.O.)I have lost something. I'm not exactly
          sure what it is, but I know I didn't
          always feel this... sedated. But you know
          what? It's never too late to get it back.INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAYLester sits at his workstation, a BEIGE CUBICLE surrounded by
IDENTICAL BEIGE CUBICLES. He's staring at a computer monitor
and talking on a HEADSET PHONE. The beleaguered expression on
his face is at odds with the light, friendly tone of his
voice.LESTERHello, this is Lester Burnham from Media

Lester turns around, smiling perfunctorilyLESTERFor you, Brad? I've got five.INT. BRAD'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATERBrad is seated behind his desk in his big corner office.BRADI'm sure you can understand our need to
          cut corners around here.

Lester sits across from him, looking small and isolated.LESTEROh, sure. Times are tight, and you gotta
          free up cash. Gotta spend money to make
          money. Right?BRADExactly. So...

Brad stands, ready to usher Lester out.LESTER(blurts)

          women to fuck him!(CONTINUED)7.CONTINUED:BRADJesus. Calm down. Nobody's getting fired
          yet. That's why we're having everyone
          write out a job description, mapping out

Lester stares at him, powerless.EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOONA MOVING VAN is parked in front of the COLONIAL HOUSE next

house.

The Mercedes-Benz pulls into the Burnham driveway. Carolyn
drives, Lester is in the passenger seat.CAROLYN--there is no decision, you just write
          the damn thing!LESTERYou don't think it's weird and kinda
          fascist?CAROLYNPossibly. But you don't want to be
          unemployed.LESTEROh, well, let's just all sell our souls
          and work for Satan, because it's more
          convenient that way.(CONTINUED)8.CONTINUED:CAROLYNCould you be just a little bit more
          dramatic, please, huh?

As they get out of the car, Carolyn scopes out the MOVERS
next door.CAROLYN (CONT'D)So we've finally got new neighbors. You
          know, if the Lomans had let me represent

She heads into the house, followed by Lester.LESTERWell, they were still mad at you for
          cutting down their sycamore.CAROLYNTheir sycamore? C'mon! A substantial
          portion of the root structure was on our
          property. You know that. How can you call
          it their sycamore? I wouldn't have the
          heart to just cut down something if it
          wasn't partially mine, which of course it
          was.INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHTWe HEAR EASY-LISTENING MUSIC.

Lester, Carolyn and Jane are eating dinner by CANDLELIGHT.
RED ROSES are bunched in a vase at the center of the table.
Nobody makes eye contact, or even seems aware of anybody
else's presence, until...JANEMom, do we always have to listen to this
          elevator music?CAROLYN(considers)
          No. No, we don't. As soon as you've
          prepared a nutritious yet savory meal

          whatever you like.

A long beat. Lester suddenly turns to Jane.(CONTINUED)9.CONTINUED:LESTERSo Janie, how was school?JANE(suspicious)
          It was okay.LESTERJust okay?JANENo, Dad. It was spec-tac-ular.

A beat.LESTERWell, you want to know how things went at
          my job today?

Now she looks at him as if he's lost his mind.LESTER (CONT'D)They've hired this efficiency expert,
          this really friendly guy named Brad, how
          perfect is that? And he's basically there
          to make it seem like they're justified in
          firing somebody, because they couldn't
          just come right out and say that, could
          they? No, no, that would be too...
          honest. And so they've asked us--

          of a sudden be my best friend, just
          because you had a bad day.

She gets up and heads toward the kitchen.JANE (CONT'D)I mean, hello. You've barely even spoken
          to me for months.

She's gone. Lester notices Carolyn looking at him critically.LESTEROh, what, you're mother-of-the-year? You

calling after her.

CLOSE on the face of   RICKY FITTS, illuminated by the screen
of his DIGICAM as he   videotapes. Ricky is eighteen, but his
eyes are much older.   Beneath his Zen-like tranquility lurks
something wounded...   and dangerous.

His POV, on VIDEO: Through the kitchen window, we see Lester
at the sink, rinsing off his plate, muttering to himself. His
head suddenly jerks up and he looks at us, as if he realizes
he's being watched.INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUSLester's POV: We're looking out through the kitchen window at
the point where Ricky was just standing, but he's no longer
there.

Lester turns off the faucet, dries his hands, then tosses the
towel on the counter on his way out, where it lands next to a
framed PHOTOGRAPH of Lester, Carolyn, and a much-younger
Jane, taken several years earlier at an amusement park.

strips down to her undergarments.MONTAGE:We see Carolyn, working with fierce concentration as she:

Cleans glass doors that overlook the patio and pool;

seemingly escape against her will. Suddenly she SLAPS
herself, hard.CAROLYNShut up. Stop it. You... Weak!

But the tears continue. She SLAPS herself again.CAROLYN (CONT'D)Weak. Baby. Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!

Angela grows stronger, and the other girls DISAPPEAR
entirely.

it in a circle around us, sometimes whipping it about
violently, or, without warning, sending it soaring skyward,
then letting it float gracefully down to the ground...

Jane and Ricky sit on the bed, watching his WIDE-SCREEN TV.RICKYIt was one of those days when it's a

          just... dancing with me. Like a little
          kid begging me to play with it. For
          fifteen minutes. That's the day I
          realized that there was this entire life
          behind things, and this incredibly
          benevolent force that wanted me to know
          there was no reason to be afraid. Ever.

Carolyn enters. Lester leans against the counter, drinking
his shake directly from the blender pitcher, eyeing her. He's
got a newfound sexual energy that makes her uncomfortable,
and he knows it. Carolyn quickly rinses off her coffee cup,
avoiding his eyes, and starts out.CAROLYNJane, hurry up. I've got a very important
          appointment--JANEMom, is it okay if Angela sleeps over
          tonight?

          fight. I haven't seen her around here in

And she's gone. Jane continues staring at her father.
Finally, he glances over at her.LESTERWhat?JANE(nervous)

CLOSE on the Colonel, deeply troubled.INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATERThe door swings open silently and the Colonel enters. He
starts going through Ricky's bureau. He opens the DRAWER in

discover its false bottom. He stands and looks around, his
eyes finally landing on:

The DIGICAM and a stack of CASSETTES on a shelf. The camera
is still connected to the TV.

The Colonel turns on the TV, examines the Digicam and presses
"play." The TV's blank screen suddenly gives way to...

off into space.

step out of his pants and briefs. Then, naked except for his

him. He just looks at her sadly, then gets out of the car and
shuts the door. She starts to CRY. As before, she SLAPS

only Ricky's back and shoulders as he rolls the joint. After

Lester a blow job.

APPROACHING, and the Colonel glances over at:

behind Lester's Firebird. As Angela and Jane get out and run

BURNHAM HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - CONTINUOUSLester starts unbuttoning Angela's blouse. She seems
disconnected from what's happening. Lester pulls her blouse
open, exposing her breasts.

Lester looks down at her, grinning, unable to believe he's
actually about to do what he's dreamed of so many times, and
then...ANGELAThis is my first time.

Lester LAUGHS.LESTERYou're kidding.ANGELA(a whisper)
          I'm sorry.

A beat. Lester looks down at her, his grin fading.

His POV: Angela lies beneath us, embarrassed and vulnerable.
This is not the mythically carnal creature of Lester's
fantasies; this is a nervous child.(CONTINUED)94.CONTINUED:ANGELA (CONT'D)I still want to do it... I just thought I
          should tell you... in case you wondered
          why I wasn't... better.

Lester's face falls. There's no way he's going to go through
with this now.ANGELA (CONT'D)(confused)
          What's wrong? I thought you said I was
          beautiful.LESTER(tenderly)
          You are beautiful.

He grabs a blanket from the back of the couch and drapes it
around her shoulders, covering her nakedness.LESTER (CONT'D)You are so beautiful... and I would be a
          very lucky man...

He smiles and shakes his head. Humiliated, Angela starts to
cry.ANGELAI feel so stupid.LESTERDon't.

He hugs her, letting her put her head on his shoulder,
stroking her hair and rocking her gently.ANGELAI'm sorry.

Lester takes her by the shoulders and looks at her, serious.LESTERYou have nothing to be sorry about.

But she keeps crying. Lester hugs her again. We HEAR a loud
CLAP of THUNDER outside.LESTER (CONT'D)(smiles)

in the pouring rain.INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATERAngela, once again fully clothed, sits at the kitchen
counter. She's eating a turkey sandwich.ANGELAWow. I was starving.

Lester puts a jar of mayonnaise back in the refrigerator.LESTERDo you want me to make you another one?ANGELANo, no, no. I'm fine.

He turns to her and cocks an eyebrow.LESTER(concerned)
          You sure?ANGELAI mean, I'm still a little weirded out,
          but...
              (sincerely)
          ...I feel better. Thanks.

A long beat, as Lester studies her, then:LESTERHow's Jane?ANGELAWhat do you mean?LESTERI mean, how's her life? Is she happy? Is
          she miserable? I'd really like to know,
          and she'd die before she'd ever tell me
          about it.(CONTINUED)96.CONTINUED:Angela shifts uncomfortably.ANGELAShe's... she's really happy. She thinks
          she's in love.

Angela rolls her eyes at how silly this notion is.LESTER(quietly)
          Good for her.

An awkward beat.ANGELAHow are you?LESTER(smiles, taken aback)
          God, it's been a long time since anybody
          asked me that.
              (thinks about it)
          I'm great.

They just sit there, smiling at each other, then:ANGELA(suddenly)
          I've gotta go to the bathroom.

She crosses off. Lester watches her go, then stands there
wondering why he should suddenly feel so content.LESTER(laughs)
          I'm great.

Something at the edge of the counter catches his eye, and he
reaches for...

CLOSE on a framed PHOTOGRAPH as he picks it up: It's the
photo we saw earlier of him, Carolyn and Jane, taken several
years ago at an amusement park. It's startling how happy they
look.

Lester crosses to the kitchen table, where he sits and
studies the photo. He suddenly seems older, more mature...
and then he smiles: the deep, satisfied smile of a man who
just now understands the punch line of a joke he heard long
ago...(CONTINUED)97.CONTINUED: (2)LESTER (CONT'D)Man oh man...
              (softly)
          Man oh man oh man...

After a beat, the barrel of a GUN rises up behind his head,
aimed at the base of his skull.

ANGLE ON an arrangement of fresh-cut ROSES   in a vase on the
opposite counter, deep crimson against the   WHITE TILE WALL.
Then a GUNSHOT suddenly rings out, ECHOING   unnaturally.

crimson as the roses.INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATERRicky comes down the stairs, followed by Jane.INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATERRicky opens the door from the dining room, then stops. Jane

Their POV: A pool of blood is forming on the kitchen table.

Ricky comes into the kitchen and slowly approaches Lester's
lifeless body, wide-eyed but not afraid. Jane follows him, in
shock. Ricky kneels, gazing at Lester's unseen face... then
he smiles, ever so slightly.

His POV: Lester looks back at us; his eyes are lifeless, but
he's smiling the same slight smile.RICKY(an awed whisper)

a HAMPER. Then, suddenly aware of Lester's scent, she grabs
as many of his clothes as she can and pulls them to her,
burying her face in them. She sinks to her knees, pulling
several items of clothing down with her, and she begins to
cry.EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHTIN BLACK & WHITE:A younger Carolyn sits across from us in one of those

of the empty white PLASTIC BAG being blown about. The wind
carries it in a circle around us, sometimes whipping it about
violently, or, without warning, sending it soaring skyward,
then letting it float gracefully down to the ground...LESTER (V.O.)I guess I could be pretty pissed off
          about what happened to me... but it's
          hard to stay mad, when there's so much
