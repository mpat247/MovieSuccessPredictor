           heard."(LAUGHING)So my wife and my four year old

          style Goddess of Vengeance and Destruction. A moment of
          FROZEN SHOCK on the rest of Wade's Hit Crew...And she pulls the trigger. A HIGH PITCHED WHISTLE asTHE ROCKET STREAKS across the Terminal! Headed straight

          cold. Aisha rappels off the Oil Tower in the distance.
          VARIOUS PAR-SEC TEAMS fire at her! Cougar scoops up two
          rifles and tosses one to Jensen - they give her covering
          fire as she comes! As he shoots, to the wounded Pooch:JENSEN (CONT'D)Can you stand?POOCHI've been shot in both legs, what
           kind of dumbass question is that?JENSENOh, so we're Mr. Grumpy now? You're

          AMMO. Par-Sec Team, almost on top of her whenA FIGURE emerges from an OVERTURNED TRUCK. GUN in each
          hand, BLAZING. The Par-Secs cut down one by one. The
          figure lowers his guns. Desert Eagles. Walks up to her.
          Underneath the blood, oil, and grime, it'sCLAY. They stare at each other...Then, incredibly, Aisha RAISES HER WEAPON AT HIM.AISHADid you kill my father?

           you're his family, so I understand.And then, incredibly, Cougar lays his rifle at her feet.SURRENDERING...COUGAR (CONT'D)But only me.Clay and Jensen blink, shocked. Aisha stares at Cougar,
          equally surprised. She levels her pistol AT HIS HEAD...
          Silence. We CUT WIDE to see...A GUNSHOT. Muzzle flash from Aisha's gun. COUGAR FALLS...In close again. Aisha stands over Cougar's body.The others, stunned... And then Cougar rises. Face
          BLOODY. Cheek ripped open, from where the bullet creased
          his flesh. She FIRES AGAIN - BLAM!Identical scar on his other cheek. Blood runs down his
          face. He doesn't move to wipe it away.AISHAWear it. Remember him.108.Cougar nods. Leans down, picks up his rifle. Debt paid.JENSENOkay, excellent, very tribal--We

           this would play out.CLAYAisha thinks you kill me.ROQUEIt's a distinct possibility...They begin circling one another. Clay, still weaponless.ROQUE (CONT'D)You don't have a knife?CLAYDon't need one.ROQUEBit of as longshot for you...CLAY(SMILING)No. It's not.Roque LUNGES AT HIM...But Clay does have a knife. He PULLS IT and SLAMS IT
          into Roque's belly! Roque, stunned! Staggers back...For most men, that would be the end of the fight. But

          Roque gets Clay with a left cross, then buries his knife
          in Clay's shoulder. Clay twists free, slashes at Roque.Ten seconds in, the men separate again. Breathing hard...Clay sees Roque doesn't have his knife. Looks - realizing
          it's still embedded in his own shoulder. Pulls it out,
          TOSSES IT BACK TO ROQUE. They stand there, both panting...
          Then RUN AT EACH OTHER full tilt!Here's how it ends. And pay attention, IT HAPPENS FAST:Clay goes low -- coming up to grab Roque's knife hand,
          which is arcing DOWNWARDS TOWARDS CLAY'S THROAT -- Clay
          manages to HALT THE HAND, blade inches from his Adam's
          apple -- and there's a moment where Roque could overpower
          him and actually cut his head off... But Clay THROWS HIS
          WEIGHT FORWARD and BREAKS ROQUE'S RIGHT ARM!And for the first time, Roque SCREAMS.Which seems to make Clay happy.So he BREAKS ROQUE'S LEFT ARM too.Roque falls to his knees, BROKEN, BLOODY, AND BEATEN...

          The ROCKET LAUNCHER clutched in her hands.She takes a knee. Aims at the plane, which is almost at
