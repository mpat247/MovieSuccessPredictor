   to be attached to someone who has a lot on their mind.INT. CAFE-DAYLOUIS, a college student in his late twenties stares at a
   friend who is sitting off screen. Louis is calm, almost
   villainous in how collective he is.

   He stares at this unseen friend, trying to assess the
   cause for his anxious state.LOUIS(smug)
          Something is bothering you...

   We finally see QUINN, also in his late twenties. He is
   obviously uneasy about being out in public with this
   person.QUINNI appreciate the faux concern but I'm
          fine.

   Louis is taken aback.LOUISMy concern is genuine...QUINNWith our history can you honestly say you
          care about my well being?LOUISYes I can, our connection is a product of
          destiny. I have no ill-will against you.

   Quinn scoffs.QUINN1941-LOUIS-The Stephen Speilberg film?QUINNNo, there was that little French girl I
          liked. You..you violated her and torched
          her farm killing her family-2.LOUIS-Actually you are jacking up the story, I
          violated her father in front of
          her...then I torched the farm.QUINNWell...that makes it ten times better.LOUISQuinn that was war, people do crazy
          things midst of wide spread conflict. I
          have gotten jaded over time. It's not
          like the dark ages when I had style.QUINNWhen you would rape the horses and ride
          away on the women?LOUISYeah I was such a ham.
          (beat)
          Quinn, this is what we do. I have gotten
          carried away in the past, but now I'm
          tired. I just want to get this over with.
          It's our calling, we help bring order and
          balance to the universe.
           (beat)
          Maybe I would feel less removed if you
          would let me win just once.QUINNThis isn't a 1930's boxing match. If I
          take dive, I'm not lining the pockets of
          some bookie...I'm bringing on the
          apocalypse.
Louis takes a drink of his coffee.LOUISSee at least our obligation would be
          over.QUINNLouis I might be nervous, but I accept my
          role as savior of this world.

young college aged couple. Zoey is obviously trying to
have a serious conversation, while Rick hides behind his
laptop using it as a shield.ZOEY...I'm not saying this is an
          intervention.

Rick doesn't look up from his laptop screen.RICKWouldn't there be more people here if it
          was an intervention?ZOEYSee and I don't want it to be-RICK(disinterested)

          didn't have this "so called problem" if
          you would have even been interested in
          me.ZOEYOf course I would. I just-RICK-Take it upon yourself to save people.ZOEYOK...maybe. Honestly we have to save each
          other, who else is going to do it.RICK(continued to be removed)
          People could just save themselves.ZOEYTrue. Is that human nature? People rely
          on false deities, self help books...Rick
          the day I realized we were alone in the
          universe was the day I realized we have
          to be there for each other.
          (beat)
          Plus don't you find it romantic that I
          want to save you? Like a movie...RICKSo our relationship is like a romantic
          comedy?ZOEY(dreamy)
          A Cameron Crowe romantic comedy.RICKOh well...so do you want to see what I'm

          confrontational situations.6.ZOEYI'm not trying to be confrontational...I
          just...you are breaking up with me?RICK-Yeah...Can I have my laptop back now?

Zoey, still confused, slowly turns the laptop back toward
Rick.RICK (CONT'D)(looking at the screen)
           This part is fucking priceless.

Zoey is bewildered.EXT. PARK-AFTERNOONLouis kicks at the ground, almost as if he was searching
for something. His foot finally rests on a broken tree
limb.

He places his foot under it and kicks it up to his right
hand.LOUISThis will do.

He throws it over to Quinn, who catches it in one swift
move.QUINNSo what are you wanting to do?

Louis searches around for a stick of his own.LOUISI figure we would train...QUINNWhy?

Louis finds what he is looking for as he spins his limb
into attack position.LOUISBecause you dominate me every time-

completely distant, as Anna's words pass through her into
thin air.ANNAYou know I don't like interjecting myself
          into other people's affairs but-ZOEY(barley paying attention)
          -But you're going toANNAYou let Rick do this to you.ZOEY(Snapping to it)
           How so?ANNAYou think you can change the men you are
          with. You can't get into a relationship
          with someone in the hopes that you can
          mold them into the person you want them
          to be.ZOEYRick needed someone stable-ANNA-Rick needs castrated.ZOEYThat's slightly strong.ANNAHe was an asshole.ZOEYMisunderstood-ANNA-OK I'll meet you half
          way...misunderstood asshole.

          You have been repeating the same cycle
          your whole entire life.8.ZOEYNow that's a little off base.CUT TO:ANIMATED SEQUENCEFLASHBACKZOEY 10 YEARS OLDA young BOY is sitting on another little boy's head. It
looks like he is passing gas on him.ANNA (V.O.)Remember Billy, who used to give kids the
            "dirty bomb"? You took it upon yourself
            to change this behavior-

The boy is now doing the same to Zoey.ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)-This put you right in the cross-hairs to
            be his next victim.ZOEY 13 YEARS OLDZACK, a young teenager is selling drugs on the street
corner. His bags of coke should be exaggerated, as well
as the customers coming up to buy from him. Think if
South Park was crossed with HBO's The Wire.ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)Good old Zack the neighbourhood drug
            dealer-
Zoey takes Zack into a room labeled "Rehab" on the door.ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)-You took it upon yourself to be his
            personal savoir. What did it get you?

Zack is out with Zoey when a few of his old GANG FRIENDS
show up looking to collect. Zack opens his pockets to
show he doesn't have any dough on him.ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)Well when Zach's old business partners
            wanted to collect on a debt-

Zack slowly pushes Zoey toward them.9.A few days later we see Zoey being used as a human coffee
table as the gang uses her back to cut cocaine.ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)- they used you to replace their missing
          coffee table they broke during a drunken
          party.ZOEY 17 YEARS OLD.A gang member looks directly into the camera. He smiles
showing his golden grille.ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)-And then you have Toothpick. What kind
          of name is Toothpick?ZOEY (V.O.)It was his gang name.ANNA (V.O.)Of course.

It's prom night and Toothpick is in his "pimp" tux. He
takes a swig of his "40" while he dances with Zoey.ANNA (CONT'D)We won't talk about prom night. Needless
          to say it wasn't romantic.

Toothpick and Zoey are in an hotel room. Toothpick is
standing over Zoey, who is facedown on the bed. It
appears he is urinating on her. It's hard to tell with
the black censor bar.END SEQUENCEBACK TO:PARK-RIVERSIDE-PRESENT DAYZOEYExaggerations-ANNA-Accurate account of events... The story
          of your romantic life-ZOEY-Unfair. Because these people need
          someone who is going to sacrifice their
          own needs for them.10.ANNAWhy?ZOEYWho else is going to do it? We're alone
          in the universe. If we are going to make
          it through this "crazy world" we need to
          look out for each other.ANNAI think you use atheism and the whole "we
          are alone in the universe" jive to
          justify your actions.
          (beat)
          I regret taking you to see Dawkins
          because you use that as a fall back to be
          codependent.ZOEYFirst of all you are bitter about the
          whole Dawkins thing, because you flashed
          him your tits and got us kicked out-ANNA-You didn't even know the first thing
          about "The God Delusion" until I gave you
          a copy-ZOEY-And someone who was huge supporter turns
          her back because Richard Dawkins didn't
          like her nipple piercing-ANNA(playful banter)
          -Enjoy your suite in hell non-believer-ZOEY(more banter)
          -Enjoy your delusional life there fence
          sitter. How about you pray to Thor to hit
          me with a lighting bolt so I can be
          removed from this asinine conversation.ANNAYou're hiding behind this religious
          debate because you don't want to admit
          you have always gravitated toward the
          "wrong type" of guy.

Zoey is staring off into space.11.ZOEY(detached)
          I actually stopped listening to you.ANNAWhat are you staring at?

Zoey points at Quinn and Louis, who are fighting with
tree limbs in the distance.ZOEYWho are those guys?ANNAThe one closest to us is Quinn. Very
          weird, socially awkward type of guy. I
          don't know who his friend is.ZOEYWhat are they doing?ANNAI don't know. Looks like that stuff my ex-
          Rob was into-ZOEYOh that medieval rugby style game-ANNA-Yeah the made up sport from "Blood Of
          Heroes"...Oh...Jugger!-ZOEY-Sounds pornographic.

          So Quinn? What else do you know about
          him?ANNAOh no you don't! This is exactly what I
          was talking about!

Anna senses something in Zoey that she is trying to hide.ANNA (CONT'D)Wait a second? You've already established
          contact with Quinn?ZOEYWhat is this MI-6?ANNAYou have your sights on him already!12.ZOEYNo, I'm just curious.ANNAWhat happened?DISSOLVE TO:TITLE CARD: 2 HOURS AGOPARK-RIVERSIDE-EARLIERZoey is overcome with emotion as she makes her way down

hand.CLOSE UP-HANDAs her hand opens a class ring was digging into her palm.
It appears this might have belonged to Rick.PARK-RIVERSIDEStill teary eyed, Zoey angrily throws the ring toward the
river. A gust of wind causes the ring to curve and it
slams into the temple of a man sitting on a park bench.

Zoey walks over to apologize and meets Quinn for the
first time.ZOEY(making her way to the bench)

Zoey takes the folder from him and starts reading.JACK (CONT'D)I spent a lot of time gathering that
          information.ZOEYSo what is all this?JACKQuinn Wilson and Louis Marks were
          orphans.

Zoey is flipping through documents.JACK (CONT'D)Quinn displayed some erratic behavior
          from the beginning. One of the staff
          members was Mormon and they would read
          stories to Quinn out of the Book Of
          Mormon. That employee was later fired,
          but a seed was planted in Quinn's head.
          He kept going on about how he and Louis
          were meant to fight to the death. Some of
          the children at the time claim Louis
          would encourage this behavior. He
          probably thought this was Quinn's attempt
          at playing.
          (beat)
          As things continued the staff at the
          orphanage thought Quinn needed help
          beyond what they could offer. They sent
          Quinn to a hospital.

Zoey puts the folder down, the documents fall to the
floor.ZOEYYou're not telling me anything I didn't
          already know.ANNAThat makes it worse. You're going to

          choice.

Zoey picks the documents up and places them in the
folder. She then tosses the folder on the coffee table.JACKWhy don't you let us save you? Please
          Zoey.ZOEYLet me be guys.

Zoey walks to her bedroom, leaving Anna and Jack
exhausted.ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-EARLY MORNINGThe apartment is quiet. Anna no where in sight, more than
likely in her room sleeping.

Jack is passed out on the couch. Zoey walks in, it's
obvious she hasn't slept all night.

She scoots Jack's legs over and sits on the couch. She
proceeds to pick up the file folder.

She starts thumbing through the documents. After a few
moments she finds one of interest.

She reaches over and pushes Jack.JACK(rousing up)

Quinn looks at Zoey, dead in the eyes.QUINNGoodbye.

Quinn turns toward Louis. He pulls his katana up to
attack position and Louis follows suit.ZOEY(tearing up)
          Wow...yeah goodbye.69.Quinn and Louis charge each other. Zoey doesn't bother to
stay to watch the battle. She slowly walks away.

Quinn and Louis' swords meet. The clang is triumphant.
Details of this climatic battle will be choreographed by
the actors involved, but think high flying Shaw Brothers
film.

We don't see a clear victor, just the two boys going at
it until we can't tell who is who.OTHER SIDE OF THE FIELD-AWAY FROM THE BATTLEZoey starts to make a call on her cell phone.CLOSE SHOT-CELL PHONEShe starts to dial 911. Her thumb moves in the position
to hit send.OTHER SIDE OF THE FIELDZoey stops. She slowly puts her phone away. She looks
back toward where the battle is going on.

She starts to walk back. The walk turns into a jog.
Finally the jog turns into a full run.OPEN FIELDWhen she gets to the field Quinn and Louis are gone. All
that can be seen is Ryan Blood's body, two katanas and an
empty ninja suit.
Zoey leans down and touches Quinn's katana.ZOEY(laughs to herself)

             Goodbye boys...

Zoey stares out into the open field. She feels reborn.
She knows there is a new world, a new perspective for her
beyond the horizon.CUT TO:BLACKNESSTITLE CARD: 70 YEARS LATER70.INT. UNIVERSITY CONFERANCE HALLThe camera slowly pans toward an older ninety year old
Zoey. She's behind a podium, there is a sign on the front
that reads: Marshal University Association of Free
Thought.ZOEYFor years we have thought absence of the
          impossible indicated that we were
          exercising free thought. In my experience
          ladies and gentleman, that's not the
          case.

          Believing in hope my friends, opening
          yourself up to accepting there might be
          more than the world around you. That's
          truly being a free thinker.

The camera ends with a close shot on Zoey's face.EXT. PARK-RIVERSIDE-LATERZoey sits on the same bench where she met Quinn. Her
great-granddaughter, JENNIFER walks up. She sits down
beside her grandmother.JENNIFERHey Grandma.ZOEYHey...JENNIFERYou look solemn.ZOEYJust sitting here...thinking...JENNIFERWhat are you thinking about?ZOEYI've had a great life. A wonderful

          make sure it's yours. Don't let it stem
          from anger or past tragedies.
          (beat)
          Let it come from your heart.

Jennifer turns around.ZOEY (CONT'D)What is it?JENNIFERMy new boyfriend. The one I wanted you to
          meet.

Zoey turns around to see the BOYFRIEND walking toward
them. It shouldn't come to a surprise that he looks a lot
like Quinn.

Jennifer gets up and grabs her boyfriend around the
waist. He reaches his hand out to Zoey.BOYFRIEND(nervous)
          Nice to meet to ma'am.ZOEY(shakes his hand)

The two lovebirds walk away. Zoey stares at them for a
second. A it "can't be look" crosses her face.START "DONE AND DUSTED'CLOSE UP-ZOEY'S FACEZoey smiles almost to say to the camera that there is
more out there. Things that we don't fully understand.
The smile then fades.

Dusted plays we...FADE OUT.THE END
