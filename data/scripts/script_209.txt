THE BOOK OF ELIWritten byGary WhittaJune 21, 2007A civilization is destroyed only when its gods are destroyed.-Emil CioranEXT. FOREST - DAWNBare as all hell. The trees stripped of their bark and white
          like ghosts. Some torn violently from their roots and felled.STARK GRAY SUNLIGHT shafts between the trees, clouded by a
          creeping fog that obscures the true color of everything. A
          LIGHT SNOW flutters. The world monochrome, lifeless and cold.A CAT prowls across the dead earth. Barely recognizable as
          the domestic breed it might once have been. Its fur mangy and
          rank, body rib-thin from starvation. Entirely feral.It moves slowly, cautiously. Sniffing the air, scanning the
          forest, alert. Trusting nothing of its surroundings. It paces
          across a leaf-strewn clearing, closing stealthily on:A DEAD MAN, splayed face-down in the earth. His feet bare.
          Face frozen in a grim death mask. A GAPING GUNSHOT WOUND in
          his head, the dried blood caked around it matting his hair.As the cat moves closer, approaching warily:P.O.V. FROM ACROSS THE CLEARINGAbout thirty yards away. Someone is watching. Waiting. SLOW,
          DEEP BREATHS, heard through a GASMASK RESPIRATOR.CLOSE ON A PAIR OF INDUSTRIAL GOGGLESThe MIRRORED LENSES reflecting the forest clearing, locked
          onto the cat. The slow, metered breathing continues.THE CAT slows, but continues pacing toward the corpse. More
          cautious than ever. It inches forward, sniffing at the body.ON THE WATCHER. Crouched behind the mangled stump of a felled
          tree. Concealed beneath a camouflaging mesh of leaves, twigs
          and bracken. A "ghillie suit" of the kind used by snipers.THE CAT sniffs at the dead man's hand, frozen by death in a
          grotesquely contorted claw. The animal still unsure. Looks
          around again, checking its surroundings for predators.THE WATCHER moves almost imperceptibly. The leaves covering
          him rustle ever so slightly as we hear - just barely - the
          familiar creaking sound of a BOW STRING BEING DRAWN TAUT.THE CAT hears it. Looks up, alert. Staring right at the
          watcher, but he is too well camouflaged to be seen. An
          interminable, tense BEAT - is the prey going to flee?Finally, the cat turns its attention back to the carcass,
          nibbling gingerly at the flesh of the man's fingers.2.THE WATCHER looses the arrow. It sails across the clearing
          and SKEWERS THE CAT clean through. It drops to the ground.THE WATCHER STANDS, shaking off the ghillie suit, revealing
          him to us for the first time.He wears a weather-beaten knee-length duster. Hooded sweater
          with more layers beneath that. Torn pants and scuffed work
          boots. Everything filthy and battered from years of wear.Along with the goggles, his face remains obscured by a
          DISPOSABLE PAPER DUST MASK and a CRUDELY-FASHIONED FUR HAT
          with dangling ear flaps that may once itself have been a cat.Around his neck he wears a silver SAINT CHRISTOPHER PENDANT
          hanging from a frayed twine cord.His name is ELI.He shoulders the bow and walks across the clearing. Crouches
          beside the dead cat and pulls out the arrow. Wipes the blood
          from the shaft, then reaches down to collect the body.Suddenly the cat SCREECHES AND FLAILS WILDLY! Eli recoils,
          falling backward, stunned, as the cat - MORTALLY WOUNDED BUT
          FIGHTING TO THE DEATH - bites and claws desperately at him.Eli struggles violently with the cat, wrestling it to the
          ground and grabbing up a HUNK OF FALLEN BRANCH. He holds the
          writhing animal down and CLUBS IT until it lays still.He sits back, breathing harder than the dustmask will allow.
          He yanks it down, revealing the dirty, unshaven face beneath.
          Impossible to tell his age, but certainly not a young man.For a moment he just sits there. Then bundles up the dead cat
          and returns to the mangled tree stump. Folds away his ghillie
          suit into a nearby RUCKSACK which he hauls up onto his back.A canteen dangles from the backpack, a SHOTGUN strapped to
          its side. Eli reaches down for his final possession - an old
          SAMURAI SWORD in a scabbard which he slings across his back.He gazes up at the sky. A snowflake drifts down and lands on
          his cheek. He reaches up and brushes it away, leaving a BLACK
          SMEAR on his face. Not snow after all, but some kind of ASH.EXT. FOREST ROAD - DAYEli emerges from the treeline onto the cracked and ruptured
          asphalt. Lined by more of those ghostly, stripped-bare trees.3.He sniffs the air, breathing it in. Checks the road in both
          directions. Deserted. A few yards away is the rusted, burned-
          out chassis of a CAR. He heads toward it.The car rests half on the road, half in the adjacent ditch.
          Stripped of its tires and engine. In the driver's seat is a
          MUMMIFIED BODY. A BULLET HOLE piercing its forehead.Eli regards the body dispassionately. Tries the door handle
          but it's jammed. He yanks on it harder and eventually
          wrenches it open. He leans in and checks the man's feet.They're bare. No shoes or socks. Eli curses under his breath.He leaves the car behind and heads on down the road. As he
          walks away, we see that the sole of one of his boots has worn
          loose, held in place now only by a rubber band.EXT. ROAD - DAYEli continues down the road. He ambles along slowly, a man in
          no hurry. A man who has been walking a long time.The road has since emerged from the forest. Passing now
          through a wasteland of dead scrub brush and urban junk.The sun beats down from directly overhead. The sky has no
          color to it, paper-white. The unfiltered sun's stark light
          leaves everything seeming bleached-out, over-exposed.CRANE UP as Eli walks on. On the horizon is the silhouette of
          a CITY. Or what was once a city. Columns of BLACK SMOKE rise
          from within, casting a deathly pall over the skyline. BURNED
          AND BROKEN SKYSCRAPERS jut out like tombstones.Eli reaches a fork in the road and stops. The road he's on
          appears to wind off in the direction of the ruined city on
          the horizon. The other fork continues on into the wasteland.After a brief pause, Eli changes direction and heads off down
          the other fork, away from the city.EXT. ABANDONED TOWN - DAYLittle more than a main street lined with storefronts. Eli
          walks steadily along, side-stepping rubble and debris.
          Ignoring the petrified corpses lying in the street.He passes by abandoned stores, every one picked clean. Empty
          shelves, smashed windows. Looted and burned. He doesn't even
          look inside, knowing already that he will find nothing.Until he comes to a store that does cause him to stop. An old-
          fashioned sign squeaks on rusted hinges in the breeze.4.ED'S SHOES - GENTLEMEN'S AND LADIES' FOOTWEARHe steps into the doorway and pushes open the door. It swings
          open on its one remaining hinge before splintering away from
          the frame and crashing to the floor in a cloud of dust.INT. SHOE STORE - CONTINUOUSEli steps inside. Like all the others, the store has been
          cleaned out. Shoe racks and empty boxes strewn over the
          floor. The whole place reeking of dead, musty air.Eli looks around, just to be sure. Drags his sheathed sword
          idly along the empty racks as he checks them. Nothing.As he turns back for the door, his foot nudges against a shoe
          box. It's not empty. He crouches down, flips the lid off
          hopefully... and pulls out a LADY'S HIGH-HEELED SHOE.He strokes the shoe leather with his hand. Shakes his head
          grimly, then tosses the shoe back into the box and leaves.EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAYOn the outskirts of town. In disrepair - peeling paint,
          broken windows, damp-stained walls - but habitable.Eli stands in the front yard, surrounded by brownish,
          overgrown weeds. Thinking it over. Turns to face the setting
          sun. It will be dark soon. He turns back toward the house.INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAYThe front door is sent CRASHING OPEN with a hard kick,
          revealing Eli silhouetted in the fading sunlight. The shotgun
          unhitched from his pack and held ready. He moves inside.Another dead place. Flies buzzing in the still, dank air.
          Everything covered in a thick layer of dust but otherwise
          largely preserved. An eerie snapshot of a world long gone.KITCHENEvery cupboard empty. Eli checks each one, poking around in
          the dark corners with his sword, but finds nothing but dust.He opens the freezer, checks inside. Empty save for a small
          ICEBOX. The lid stuck fast with mildew and gunk. Eli digs at
          it with his grimy fingernails and manages to pry it open.Inside are the wizened, petrified remains of a HUMAN HAND.
          Floating in slimy, discolored water. The smell vile and thick
          enough to make Eli retch. He quickly jams the lid back on.5.BEDROOMA wooden bedframe stripped clean. The dresser drawers have
          been emptied and lie strewn across the floor. Eli moves
          toward a large walk-in closet and opens the door.No clothes inside - just the near-fossilized corpse of a MAN
          HANGING BY A NOOSE. Twisting gently back and forth.Unfazed, Eli crouches down and checks the man's feet. An old
          pair of Converse All-Stars hang limp from the man's skeletal
          ankles. Eli calmly sets about unlacing them.He checks the size; they're a fit. He upturns each shoe and
          shakes the old flakes of mummified flesh from them. Discards
          his ruined boots and puts on the sneakers, laces them up.He walks around, pacing up and down, getting a feel for the
          new shoes. They feel good. For the first time, he smiles.LATEREli sits in the corner, roasting the carcass of the dead cat
          over a small CAMPFIRE. He cleans the animal's pelts as he
          watches it cook. Pokes at the meat with a pen-knife, checking
          it for done-ness. It appears ready to eat.He clasps his hands together in prayer.ELIDear Lord, thank you for your
                    generosity in providing us today
                    with this bountiful feast.He speaks QUIETLY, his voice barely above a whisper. Even so,
          we catch the accent - a RASPY, OLD-WORLD MIDWEST DRAWL, like
          John Wayne or some other long-forgotten western icon.ELIThank you for the many gifts that
                    you have given me. Thank you for
                    your protection and your guidance.
                    Thank you for bringing me this far.
                    I know my long journey's end is
                    near. I ask now only for the
                    strength and the courage to
                    complete the task that you in your
                    infinite wisdom saw fit to bestow
                    upon me over all men. I won't let
                    you down. Amen.He signs a cross over himself, then uses the knife to saw off
          a chunk of meat. Takes a bite, savoring the taste with great
          relish. To him, it's grade-A filet mignon.6.ELIHey. You hungry?It appears as though he is talking to himself... until a RAT
          emerges from his coat pocket, whiskers twitching keenly. Eli
          offers it some meat. The rat gnaws enthusiastically at it.SUNDOWNThe last of the waning sunlight shafts through the bedroom's
          broken window. Eli rummages through his backpack, pulls out a
          SMALL PACKAGE wrapped in cloth and tied fast with string.He sits back in his corner and carefully unwraps it. It's an
          OLD LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. The binding cracked and pages dog-
          eared, thumbed through a thousand times and more.Eli gazes lovingly at it. Lets his fingers play across the
          beat-up old leather cover. A cherished thing.He begins to read, half-hidden in the shadows of the fading
          sunlight. Silently mouthing the words as he reads them.MANY PAGES LATEREli closes the book and parcels it back up as before.
          Replaces it in his pack, then reaches in for something else.A CAR BATTERY. Old and streaked with acid stains. Attached to
          a tangled bunch of ELECTRICAL WIRING and JUMPER CABLES. Eli
          reaches into his pocket and produces:AN IPOD. Badly beat-up, the case pretty much held together
          with duct tape. But functional. Eli attaches the battery
          cable to the iPod and places the headphones in his ears.The music plays. Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 20 in D Minor.
          Eli rests back against the wall and pushes the volume way up.THE MUSIC SWELLS. Eli's fingers dance and swoop in the air,
          as though conducting an orchestra, as he is transported by
          the music to another world, a world far from this one.MORNINGSunlight shafts through the window. Eli sits slumped in the
          exact same position, headphones still in his ears. Asleep.The rat scurries up Eli's chest and licks his face. Slowly,
          he wakes, realizing he fell asleep with his music still on.
          Checks the battery. It's dead, drained overnight. He frowns.He gets to his feet, moves to the window and checks outside.
          All seems quiet. He loads up his backpack and weapons.7.ELICome on now.The rat scurries up his leg, onto his duster and disappears
          into the breast pocket. Eli turns and moves out.EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - MORNINGThe gate squeaks shut behind Eli as he exits the front yard.He breathes in the air, turns to feel the warm morning sun on
          his face. Then turns away from it and walks on down the road.EXT. ROAD - DAYThe landscape barren and featureless, road lined with dead
          trees. Eli walks along the warped and broken asphalt.The road is strewn with burned-out cars and debris from a
          world long dead. A warped metal sign by the side of the road
          reads: LITTER REMOVAL NEXT TWO MILES BY: "CIRCUIT CITY".Up ahead is a HUNCHED FIGURE by the side of the road. Eli
          arrives to see that it's a YOUNG WOMAN. Bone-thin, dressed in
          filthy rags. Skin plagued by an unpleasant rash.The SHOPPING CART she was pushing has overturned into a
          roadside ditch, spilling its contents. Blankets, tins of
          food, old clothes. She's on her knees trying to gather it up.She looks up as she sees Eli approaching. Instantly cowers
          from him, raising her hands to protect herself. Terrified.YOUNG WOMANOh. Please don't hurt me. Here,
                    take anything you want. You want
                    some food? Take it.She offers him a can of pet food with a trembling hand. Eli
          stands there looking at her. His expression impossible to
          read behind the mirrored goggles.ELII'm not going to hurt you.YOUNG WOMANThat's what the last guys said.Eli bends down and picks up a couple of the cart's spilled
          contents. Steps forward and offers them to her.ELIHere.8.She blinks. Unsure. Cautiously she reaches out and takes it.YOUNG WOMANCould you help me? The wheel came
                    off. I can't fix it. Maybe if I
                    could get it out of the ditch. But
                    I can't.Eli looks at the cart. It has come to rest in the ditch just
          inches from a THICK BRACKEN HEDGEROW that lines the road.He looks again at the girl. Her faded blouse is unbuttoned,
          revealing a little cleavage. Her skirt torn along the leg,
          showing more than a little thigh. Almost deliberate.He sniffs the air. Watches the hedgerow warily. Just like the
          cat he hunted, his senses heightened and on alert.Behind the hedge, THREE ROADSIDE BANDITS are crouched,
          waiting to pounce. Each armed with a crude blunt weapon. They
          exchange anxious looks.ELI sniffs the air again - then backs away from the girl.ELIOne good thing about no soap any
                    more. You can smell the road agents
                    a mile off.The girl's face falls as Eli backs up. The three bandits
          EMERGE FROM THE HEDGEROW, brandishing their weapons. A couple
          of them wear old sunglasses and goggles similar to Eli's.The BANDIT LEADER grabs the girl by a fistful of hair as he
          passes, yanking her painfully to her feet.BANDIT LEADERDumb bitch. What did we tell you?He pushes her away, she crumples to the road in a heap.Eli backs away, but TWO MORE ARMED BANDITS drop from hiding
          in the trees behind, cutting off his escape, surrounding him.BANDIT LEADERWhat you got there in the pack?ELINothing.BANDIT LEADERYeah, that's what they all say. How
                    about you take it off real slow and
                    tip it out so's we can take a look?9.BANDIT #2 notices the shotgun strapped to the pack.BANDIT #2He's got a gun.BANDIT LEADERShit, it ain't loaded. They never
                    are. Ain't that right, old man?(BEAT)Open the fucking pack or die.ELII can't do that.The bandit leader steps forward aggressively. Now within
          striking distance of Eli. He grins, teeth filthy and rotten.BANDIT LEADERWant us to do it for you? We can
                    get it off real easy after we've
                    hacked your fucking arms off.Eli remains perfectly calm. And though he speaks with a soft,
          even tone, there is something formidable about his voice.ELIIt's real important you boys listen
                    to me and understand. The man I
                    work for, you do not want to cross
                    him. See, I'm under his protection.
                    You stand in my way, you stand in
                    his. And he will cut you down with
                    a righteous fury - through me. For
                    I am his faithful instrument.BEAT. The bandit leader looks at Eli incredulously... and
          then LAUGHS. The other bandits laugh along nervously.BANDIT LEADERWhat the hell are you, some kinda
                    preacher?ELISomething like that.BANDIT LEADERWell I got news for you, preacher
                    man. Whatever kinda God you reckon
                    yourself to be working for, he left
                    these parts a long time ago. He
                    ain't here to protect your ass. Now
                    take off the pack and set it on the
                    ground.10.Eli doesn't move, doesn't say a word. The bandit leader takes
          another step forward and shoves him in the shoulder.BANDIT LEADERYou fucking listening to me?ELII hear you. You lay that hand on me
                    again and you will not get it back.The other bandits exchange nervous looks. This is not how
          it's supposed to go.BANDIT LEADERAll right, I had just about enough
                    of this shit...He lunges forward, grabs the shoulder strap of Eli's pack.If you blinked, you missed it. But somehow Eli has now drawn
          his sword. A RIVULET OF BLOOD snakes down along the blade and
          drips onto the asphalt.Bandit leader's hand is still gripped firmly around Eli's
          shoulder strap. But it's no longer connected to his arm. The
          SEVERED HAND hangs there from the strap, dripping blood.Bandit leader staggers backward and raises the bloody stump
          where his hand once was. Looks at it in shock and horror.BANDIT LEADERWhat... you just... he just cut my
                    fucking hand off! My fucking hand!Eli pries the hand loose from the strap and tosses it onto
          the road as bandit leader's legs give out and he slumps to
          the asphalt. His eyes dart around, as though confused.BANDIT LEADERWhat you standin' around for? Kiss
                    him!BANDIT #3What's he talkin' about, kiss him?ELIHe's in shock. He means "kill him".A tense BEAT. And then the four remaining bandits ATTACK ELI
          ALL AT ONCE, weapons flailing.Eli flourishes the sword. A BLUR, TOO FAST TO FOLLOW. But
          it's clear he is possessed of an inhuman level of skill.11.It is over in moments. The four bandits LAY SLAIN IN THE
          ROAD, blood pooling out onto the asphalt.The bandit leader crawls toward his severed hand, a few yards
          away. Eli steps in and kicks it out of his reach.ELII told you you wouldn't be getting
                    that back.Bandit leader looks up to see the figure of Eli bearing down
          on him, silhouetted ominously against the sun. He looks for a
          moment like an avenging angel, something not of this world.BANDIT LEADERWho are you?ELIMy name is Eli.And with that, Eli runs him through with his sword.He turns to see the young woman slumped in the road, sobbing.
          She cowers again as he approaches, certain that she is next.He WALKS PAST HER. Sheathes his sword, then pulls out the
          shopping cart from the ditch and rights it. The woman watches
          incredulously as he gathers up her supplies into the cart.ELITake it and go on your way. And
                    don't fall in with men like these
                    again. No good can come.She looks at him, puzzled.YOUNG WOMANWhy are you doing this?Eli says nothing. Walks back to the slain bandits, crouches
          beside them and begins searching their bodies.He takes a scarf from around the neck of one. Finds a Zippo
          lighter on another, checks that it works and pockets it.LATERThe five bodies are lined neatly in the ditch, half-covered
          with dirt. The best burial they are going to get.Eli stands before them, head bowed in prayer. He speaks
          quietly and quickly, a speech he has given many times.12.ELIGod, the father of mercies, through
                    the death and resurrection of his
                    son has reconciled the world to
                    himself and sent the holy spirit
                    among us for the forgiveness of
                    sins.The young woman stands a few yards away, watching him,
          transfixed. She has never seen anyone like him.ELIThrough the ministry of the church
                    may he give you pardon and peace,
                    and I absolve you from your sins in
                    the name of the father, and of the
                    son, and of the holy spirit. Amen.He turns and walks away down the road, passing the woman.YOUNG WOMANThank you. You're... a good man.ELIThere are no good men on the road.YOUNG WOMANWhere are you going?ELIWest.YOUNG WOMANCan... can I come with you?He doesn't even turn back to look at her.ELINo.He walks on, into the horizon.EXT. FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAYStraddling the desert like a giant, crumbling monument to a
          long-dead civilization. Eli steadily climbs his way up.He comes to an abrupt stop as we realize suddenly that the
          overpass has COLLAPSED at mid-point. RUSTED IRON RODS jut out
          from where the roadway has been severed.Eli just stands there at the edge for a moment, feeling the
          wind whip around him, his coat fluttering in the breeze.13.The overpass's collapsed section is now just a MOUNTAINOUS
          PILE OF RUBBLE that leads down to the road below.Eli steps onto the rubble. About to make his way down when he
          FREEZES. He hears something. The faintest of sounds. He takes
          cover, peering down at the road beneath the overpass to see:TWO PEOPLE walking together on the road. We see everything
          from ELI'S P.O.V. - too far to make out much detail, but
          apparently it is a MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE.The man pushes along an OLD WHEELBARROW covered by a tarp as
          the woman, seemingly his wife, walks alongside. The barrow's
          rusted wheel gives out a plaintive, rhythmic SQUEAK.Eli ducks down again as he hears something else. This time
          much louder. The menacing growl of MOTORCYCLE ENGINES.FOUR BIKES IN TOTAL. Riding out of the horizon, closing in on
          the couple. They see the bikes coming and panic. Try
          desperately to steer the barrow off the road.The bikes screech to a halt and the FOUR RIDERS dismount.
          Brandishing a variety of weapons. The couple make a run for
          it but they're quickly chased down and tackled to the ground.The woman SCREAMS and struggles helplessly as the bikers
          swarm over the man like a pack of predatory animals.The woman is pulled to the ground and the clothes stripped
          from her. Eli turns away. He knows what comes next.Eli listens as the woman screams and screams. He reaches for
          his shotgun... hesitates... then withdraws his hand.ELIIt ain't your concern. Stay on the
                    path. It ain't your concern. Stay
                    on the path.Eli repeats it like a mantra. He clearly wants to intervene,
          but will not permit himself to. Instead, he simply sits and
          waits grimly as the woman continues to scream for help. And
          then finally, suddenly, is silenced.Down below, the bodies of the man and woman lay dead and
          bloodied in the dirt. The bikers tear the tarp from the
          wheelbarrow, spilling its contents onto the asphalt.They ferret through the items, scavenging a few items - we
          don't see what - and stuffing them into an old cloth satchel.
          They leave the rest strewn in the road and ride off in the
          direction they came, dust pluming in their wake.14.Eli waits until the sound of the motorcycles has receded into
          the far distance before emerging from his hiding place.EXT. ROAD BENEATH OVERPASS - DAYEli crouches on one knee before the murdered couple. He signs
          a cross over their ravaged bodies as he mutters a prayer
          under his breath. Then stands and continues on down the road.EXT. ROAD FORK - DAYMore desolate wasteland as far as the eye can see. The road
          forks again here. Eli arrives at the junction and stops.The road Eli is on leads further into the west. The other
          fork heads toward a SMALL TOWN just visible on the horizon.A HAND-PAINTED SIGN has been driven into the dirt nearby. No
          words, just a series of CRUDE PICTOGRAMS. A BED. A PLATE OF
          FOOD. A WATER FAUCET. AN ARROW points toward the town.Eli pauses, thinking it over. Retrieves the iPod from his
          pocket. Clicks the button, but no response. He sighs.He turns and heads down the other fork, toward town.EXT. DESERT TOWN - OUTSKIRTS - DAYA primitive, sprawling village of tents and barn-like
          structures. Built from corrugated iron, rotted wood, molded
          plastic, tarpaulin - materials scavenged from the old world.HUDDLED RESIDENTS are dressed in little more than rags, many
          wearing goggles like Eli's to shield their eyes from the sun.Eli stands at the edge of town. Reluctant to enter, but he
          braces himself and walks on in. And as he rounds a corner,
          entering the center of town, an astonishing sight:EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUSThe broad thoroughfare now all that remains of whatever town
          once stood here. Many of the old storefronts still largely
          intact but patched up with salvaged materials. The asphalt
          street warped and cracked, parking meters bent and smashed.It's a lot like the abandoned town Eli passed through
          earlier, except VERY MUCH ALIVE - BUSTLING WITH TOWNSFOLK.It's at once a familiar and also a disturbing sight - like an
          old Norman Rockwell painting of classic small-town America,
          but filtered through the devastating eye of an apocalypse. An
          unsettling juxtaposition of the old world and the new.15.The centerpiece of the town is a GRAND THEATER at the head of
          the main street. THE PALLADIUM. Like the rest of the town,
          badly damaged and shoddily fixed-up. But still standing.Eli walks down the street and approaches a BLACKSMITH,
          hammering out a metal plate over an anvil outside his store.ELIYou got an engineer or a fuelman
                    around here?The blacksmith doesn't look up from his work but motions
          toward a storefront at the far end of the street.ELIThanks.Eli heads down the street. Stopping when he comes across a
          STATUE erected in the center of the road. A TALL MAN crudely
          fashioned in clay. One hand placed paternally on the head of
          a SMALL CHILD, the other outstretched toward the sun.As he observes the statue, Eli notices that passing residents
          take a moment to PAUSE AND GENUFLECT before it. Worshipping.Curious, Eli reaches up and runs his hand over the statue's
          face. Then hears SHUFFLING FEET behind him and turns as a
          PARADE OF EMACIATED MEN AND WOMEN trudges past. Roped
          together at the waist, each man leading the one behind.Heads shaved, thin from malnutrition. And each one BLIND.
          They gaze at the ground with pale, dead eyes. They carry
          picks, shovels and other tools - a sightless CHAIN GANG.Eli watches as the pathetic parade shuffles past, herded like
          cattle by a brutish CHAIN GANG BOSS who swats at them with a
          stick to keep them moving and indicate direction.CHAIN GANG BOSSCome on, move it!The gang boss glares at Eli as he passes by. Eli doesn't
          return the look, just continues crossing the street as the
          blind are herded away. Headed toward a wooden building with a
          pictogram of a LIGHTNING BOLT suspended above the door.INT. ENGINEER WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUSWhatever this place once was, it's now a kind of POST-
          APOCALYPTIC RADIO SHACK. Shelves display a variety of goods.
          Engine parts. Old electrical wiring. Small appliances.An old ELECTRIC GENERATOR rumbles noisily, powering strings
          of multi-colored CHRISTMAS LIGHTS that hang all around.16.Behind the main counter a convoluted Rube Goldberg-esque
          STILL is running. An ENGINEER in a leather apron pours the
          remnants of a can of motor oil into the still's funnel.Attached to the still is an old MOTORCYCLE MIRROR. In its
          reflection the engineer sees Eli checking out the store.Without turning around, he reaches surreptitiously behind the
          counter for something.Eli turns toward the counter - to find the engineer training
          a PUMP-ACTION SHOTGUN right at him.ENGINEERI don't know you.Eli slowly raises his hands.ELII'm not from around here.ENGINEERNo shit. Who are you?ELII'm just a customer.ENGINEERA customer with a shotgun?He nods toward the shotgun visible on Eli's backpack.ENGINEERYou come in here to rip me off?The engineer's hands tremble, his finger tight on the
          trigger. This man needs to be talked down carefully.ELINo. I'll set it down. Okay?ENGINEERSlowly!Eli nods. Unhitches the pack and sets it down, steps away.ENGINEERYou carry a gun in the outland, you
                    don't bring one into town less you
                    live there. Don't you know that?ELII'm sorry, I forgot. I've been on
                    the road a long time.17.This seems to make the engineer more suspicious of Eli.ENGINEERShow me your hand.ELII'm not a-The engineer jerks the shotgun at Eli nervously.ENGINEERI said show me your fucking hand!Eli raises his hand and holds it outstretched, palm faced
          downward. The engineer watches it closely for any sign of
          ticks or tremors, but Eli's hand stays steady as a rock.ELII'm not one of them.The sight of the steady hand seems to reassure the engineer a
          little. Finally, he lowers the shotgun.ENGINEERWhat do you want?ELII'm just passing through. I need
                    some help. I can pay.ENGINEERWhat kinda help? And what kinda
                    pay?ELII'm going to get something out of
                    my pack. Okay?The engineer raises the shotgun nervously again.ELII know, I know. Slowly.The engineer watches him like a hawk as Eli opens up his pack
          and pulls out the car battery. When he sees it, he gasps.ENGINEERHoly shit.Eli places it on the counter. The engineer looks it over with
          awe, like it's a priceless historical artifact.ENGINEERWhere'd you find this?18.ELIYears ago, in the outland back east
                    aways.ENGINEERDoes it work?ELIYeah, it just needs a charge. Can
                    you do it? I got the cables.ENGINEERDepends if you also got the coin.Eli pulls the Zippo lighter from his pocket. The engineer
          picks it up, sparks the flint, watches the flame flicker.ENGINEERIt'll take a couple hours. There's
                    a bar across the street you can
                    wait, they just opened up.ELII'll wait here.ENGINEERYou don't trust me?ELI(SMILES)I don't know you.INT. PALLADIUM - AUDITORIUM - DAYThis once grand theater have been largely gutted - seats torn
          out, fixtures and fittings stripped, curtains ripped from the
          stage. But still, there's a sense of grandeur to this place.Looking out over the stage, a ROYAL BOX - once the most
          prestigious seat in the house - has been converted into an
          OFFICE of sorts. Seats removed and replaced by an ORNATE
          MAHOGANY DESK facing inward, a CHANDELIER suspended above it.The whole set-up is gaudy and ostentatious - the work of
          someone who wants to project an aura of power and wealth, but
          has no taste whatsoever.A TALL MAN is seated in a battered leather armchair behind
          the desk, deeply involved in an OLD PAPERBACK BOOK.The book's cover is faded and partially torn away, the title
          still just visible: 7 HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE.19.The man is OLDER than most we've seen. His skin weathered by
          the elements and by a long life's experience. One of the very
          few people we've seen in this world close to Eli's age - and
          unlike everyone else we've seen, he appears healthy and well-
          groomed. A rich mane of hair, full set of teeth.He wears a tattered SUIT AND TIE. None of it matches,
          everything scavenged from different outfits and eras. But he
          looks almost civilized. Respectable. His name is CARNEGIE.He looks up from his book at the sound of a POLITE COUGH O.S.REDRIDGE stands before him. Tall, powerfully built.CARNEGIEWhat is it?His accent is like caramel. A RICH, DEEP-SOUTH DRAWL.REDRIDGESurvey team just finished up their
                    inspection. It ain't good.Carnegie lowers his book. Concerned.CARNEGIEHow bad is it?REDRIDGEPressure is down again, and going
                    by the new rod they sank levels're
                    lower than they've ever been.Carnegie stands. Thinking. This is bad news.CARNEGIEHow long?REDRIDGEHard to say. Six months, maybe. A
                    little longer if we're careful. But
                    we're already-CARNEGIEHalve the rations.REDRIDGEWe just halved `em last-CARNEGIESo halve them again!BEAT. Carnegie stares Redridge down. Nobody but nobody
          questions his orders.20.REDRIDGEYou're going to have to say
                    something. Folks were none too
                    happy last time. Gonna be worse
                    now, you can count on it.Carnegie sighs, rubs his brow. He knows Redridge is right.EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAYA LARGE CROWD OF TOWNSFOLK - several hundred strong - has
          assembled outside the Palladium theater. AN ARMED CREW OF
          CARNEGIE'S GOONS keeps watch over the crowd.Carnegie stands on a BALCONY above the theater marquee. He
          treats the balcony like a pulpit, speaking through a
          MICROPHONE connected to an old PA SYSTEM that carries his
          words to the far reaches of the crowd.CARNEGIEI want you all to remember how far
                    we've come together. And how far we
                    still can go, if only we believe.
                    When I brought us here to this
                    oasis - this promised land - we
                    knew there would be hardships. Knew
                    there would be sacrifices. But we
                    also knew that we were creating for
                    ourselves a world where we could be
                    safe from the horrors of the
                    forsaken lands beyond our borders.The crowd listens intently, hanging on Carnegie's every word.
          He is an incredibly charismatic and persuasive speaker - his
          cultivated image and inspiring, confident delivery remind us
          of a TELEVISION EVANGELIST.CARNEGIEAnd I want you all to remember
                    above all that it is not the water
                    with which we have been blessed
                    that is the true lifeblood of this
                    town... but faith.This sends a MURMUR OF DISCONTENT through the crowd. Many
          don't like where they suspect this may be going. Carnegie
          senses this and dials up his rhetoric - delivering it now
          with the fire-brand passion of an old-time baptist preacher.CARNEGIEIt is our faith that sustains us,
                    brothers and sisters! Hallelujah!21.The crowd is divided. Many return the "Hallelujah" with
          varying levels of conviction. Others are not convinced. But
          Carnegie continues unabated, selling it harder than ever.CARNEGIEAnd mark me, the ultimate
                    validation of that faith is coming!
                    The sacred Word of Our Lord that
                    formed the world before and will
                    reform it once again is coming to
                    this town to bring it succor, bring
                    it nourishment, bring it new life!
                    For the Almighty Himself has spoken
                    unto me and promised it!Carnegie is such an impassioned and inspiring speaker it's
          almost impossible not to get caught up and swept away by his
          words. His apparently unshakable belief is infectious.CARNEGIEIn the meantime, He has asked us
                    all to be patient. To walk the hard
                    road of the faithful just a little
                    longer. And to do that, we must
                    give just a little more.(BEAT)Water rations will be halved until
                    further notice.This sends a much broader ripple of discontent through the
          crowd - this news has not been received well at all. Some
          still "keep the faith" but many more are perturbed by this.Carnegie motions for the crowd to settle down.CARNEGIEI understand your frustration. The
                    road to salvation is a difficult
                    one - but what lies at the end of
                    that road is a greater glory,
                    beyond anything you can imagine.A DISCONTENTED VILLAGER steps forward, pushing through the
          crowd and jabbing his finger angrily up at Carnegie.DISCONTENTED VILLAGERWe've heard this all before! When
                    are you going to-Carnegie's goons quickly move in and efficiently SILENCE THE
          MAN, removing him from the crowd. Dissent is not tolerated
          here. Carnegie goes on speaking as if nothing had happened.22.CARNEGIEI know each and every one of you
                    will understand the necessity of
                    this action. It was faith that
                    built this town - and faith that
                    will sustain it even through the
                    dark times that may lie ahead. But
                    it is always darkest before dawn -
                    and the new dawn is coming.(BEAT)May God go with you all.Carnegie steps back inside, leaving the crowd to talk among
          themselves, clearly mixed about what they have heard.As the assembled townsfolk disperse, FOUR MOTORCYCLES roar
          into town and pull up outside the Palladium.As the riders dismount, one detaches a CLOTH SATCHEL from his
          bike's cargo rack. The four riders head inside. They each
          have long, straggly hair and brutish expressions.We recognize them now as the BIKER BANDITS who killed the
          couple on the road under the freeway overpass.INT. PALLADIUM - SECOND FLOOR - DAYCarnegie emerges into the second-floor hallway from the
          balcony, mopping his brow. Exhausted and stressed from his
          grand theatrical display, and from its mixed reception.Redridge climbs the stairs to meet him.REDRIDGEOne of the road crews just rolled
                    into town.Carnegie looks at his cracked old wristwatch.CARNEGIEOf course they did, the bar's open.
                    Outlanders, always looking for
                    answers at the bottom of a bottle.REDRIDGENot these guys.(BEAT)These guys say they got something.That gets Carnegie's attention.CARNEGIEGet them up here now.23.INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - DAYWhat was once a grand, gilded entrance foyer has, like the
          rest of the theater, been largely gutted. But it's still
          impressive - a spacious bar area with a grand staircase
          leading up to a second floor, entrance to balcony seats, etc.
          FADED OLD THEATER POSTERS still hang from the walls.The place has been shabbily converted into a kind of SALOON.
          Old ripped-out theater seats arranged around tables. A
          FIREPLACE sputters dimly.A MANGY TABBY CAT walks across the straw-laden floor. A dozen
          or so CUSTOMERS in the place, a mixed, rough-looking bunch.Redridge emerges from an upstairs room and nods to a group of
          his MEN who are holding the bikers at the foot of the stairs.INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOXCarnegie checks his reflection in a CRACKED HAND MIRROR,
          licks his palm and slicks his hair back. He adjusts his tie
          as Redridge's men usher the bikers into his "office".Carnegie wheels around and flashes a smile at them. Just as
          when he gave his balcony address, Carnegie is in performance
          mode - charismatic and slick like a campaigning politician.CARNEGIEGentlemen! It's truly a delight to
                    see you again! I understand your
                    latest excursion into the outland
                    has been a profitable one?The bikers exchange looks. They understood maybe half the
          words in that sentence. The lead biker - named HOG - speaks.HOGWe did good.CARNEGIEWell, let's see, shall we?Hog tips the satchel's contents out onto Carnegie's desk.BOOKS. About a dozen different volumes of all shapes and
          sizes. Carnegie rifles excitedly through the collection.We see various titles as he sorts through them. Treasure
          Island. The Da Vinci Code. A volume of encyclopedia. The
          Diary of Anne Frank. Tuesdays with Morrie.In amongst the books are a few MAGAZINES. An old issue of
          OPRAH magazine. A torn copy of SPORTS ILLUSTRATED...24....And a NEWSWEEK. The cover graphic illustrates OPPOSING
          NUCLEAR ARSENALS over a world globe. On one side the STARS
          AND STRIPES, on the other flags indicating a SINO-ISLAMIC
          ALLIANCE. The headline reads: "IS THERE NO TURNING BACK?"CARNEGIENo. No. No. No. No.As Carnegie rejects each book with growing disappointment and
          frustration, it's clear he's looking for a specific volume.CARNEGIEIt's not here.HOGThese ain't worth nothin'?CARNEGIEWhen you bring me the book I asked
                    you for, it'll be worth something.The bikers exchange more looks. An unspoken conversation.HOGWe been doin' this a long time now.
                    Had to make a whole lotta corpses
                    to bring you all these books. You
                    want us to keep at it, reckon it's
                    worth more than a few free glasses
                    of that swill you call liquor.Carnegie's guards bristle, ready for a confrontation.
          Carnegie just smiles, always ready to smooth things over.CARNEGIEGentlemen, gentlemen. I urge you
                    once again to take the long view
                    here. When we find this book - and
                    believe me, we will find it - we
                    are going to build a new world. A
                    world far greater, far more
                    righteous than this one. And you
                    and I are going to be perched right
                    on top of it, looking down upon it,
                    masters of all creation!As always, his carefully stage-managed rhetoric is delivered
          with the utmost conviction, every word dripping with passion
          and persuasion. He's a master salesman, a true huckster.CARNEGIEAnd you know, I think you're
                    absolutely right.(MORE)25.CARNEGIE (cont'd)
                    That is worth more than a few
                    glasses of liquor. A whole lot
                    more.He steps forward and looks Hog right in the eye. His gaze
          like a laser beam, utterly disarming.CARNEGIEThe book I want is out there

                    found. Once there were millions of
                    copies - you only need to find one!
                    Find it and bring it here. And I
                    promise you, you will be rewarded
                    beyond anything you can imagine.It's impossible not to be swayed by this guy. He's just so
          full of fiery passion and infectious belief, you almost want
          to reach into your pocket and hand over your wallet.Hog snatches up his empty satchel.HOGThis better not be bullshit.He turns and marches to the door, the other bikers following.
          The guards escort them out, only Redridge remains.Carnegie slumps back into his chair, frustrated, pissed off.REDRIDGEMight help if they knew just what
                    they were looking for.CARNEGIENot one of them can read. How would
                    they even know when they found it?REDRIDGESo how's about you just tell me?Carnegie and Redridge lock eyes. BEAT.REDRIDGETwo years now you been sending
                    these crews into the outland.
                    Burning up gas we can barely spare.
                    For a goddamn book? What the hell
                    kinda book can be worth all this?Carnegie ignores him. Stands, walks toward the door. Redridge
          sighs, gestures toward the books piled on Carnegie's desk.26.REDRIDGEWhat about these?CARNEGIEPut them with the others.INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - DAYRedridge stands by the marble fireplace, tossing the books
          into the fire. The flames flicker and leap around the books
          as their pages blacken and are consumed by the fire.INT. ENGINEER WORKSHOP - DAYEli watches as the engineer charges the battery with the gas
          generator, which chugs noisily.He licks his lips, dry as sand. Unscrews his canteen to take
          a drink, but it's down to its last few drips.ELIWhat's this place across the
                    street? They got any water?ENGINEERWe got our own underground spring
                    here. Only fresh water in a hundred
                    miles - if's you can pay for it.Eli thinks a while longer. Then stands and stuffs his shotgun
          inside his pack, shoulders his gear and makes for the door.ELII'll be back.Eli stops in the doorway and turns back to the engineer.ELIIf that battery ain't here when I
                    get back, I will use this gun on
                    your kneecaps and I will put this
                    building to the torch and I will
                    watch it burn to the ground with
                    you alive inside it. So help me
                    God.And with that he turns and leaves. The engineer gulps. Not a
          hint in Eli's voice that he didn't mean every word.INT. PALLADIUM - CARNEGIE'S BEDROOM - DAYThis old second-floor DRESSING ROOM has been converted into a
          bedroom, simply furnished.27.A WOMAN stands in front of an old DRESSING ROOM MIRROR, the
          bulbs around the frame burned-out and broken. She washes her
          face in murky water in an old PORCELAIN BOWL on the dresser.Her name is CLAUDIA. Early 30s, pretty. She gazes into the
          mirror as she dries her hands, but it's so cracked and warped
          it's near impossible to see a reflection.The door opens and Carnegie enters. He still looks steamed.
          Claudia doesn't turn to look at him, keeps facing the mirror.CLAUDIAIs that you, honey?Carnegie says nothing. Just paces angrily up and down.
          Finally Claudia turns to face him.CLAUDIASomething wrong?CARNEGIEMore books came in from the road
                    today.CLAUDIAOh? It's been a while.CARNEGIEAnd it'll be a while longer. Just
                    another pile of useless junk. If we
                    don't find the right one soon - if
                    I can't give these people what they
                    want to hear...Carnegie trails off, the thought too awful to contemplate.
          Claudia adopts a sympathetic expression, supportive.CLAUDIAYou'll find what you're looking
                    for. It's out there somewhere. You
                    just have to have faith.This seems to anger Carnegie. He wheels on her.CARNEGIEFaith? Is that what you think we're
                    missing around here?She detects the aggressive tone in his voice and goes quiet,
          head bowed. Carnegie moves toward her angrily.CARNEGIEMy old man used to have faith. He
                    had it in spades. My mother, too.(MORE)28.CARNEGIE (cont'd)
                    You know where it got them? You
                    know where it got me?He's in her face now. Claudia avoids eye contact, submissive.CARNEGIEFaith is for the weak. It's for
                    them out there, the sheep. This
                    world is what you can see and touch
                    and taste. It's what you make it.
                    All these years with me, you still
                    don't have any grasp of that?
                    What's wrong with you, woman?He's shouting now, and she's trembling, afraid to speak.CLAUDIAI'm sorry.Carnegie realizes he's frightened her. He softens.CARNEGIENo, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
                    scare you. Hey. You okay?He lifts her chin up, wipes away a tear.CARNEGIEYou just get me all riled up with
                    that kind of talk. It's not what I
                    need from you right now.(SMILES)You know what I need right now?He puts his hands on her lustfully. It's clear she's not in
          the mood, but she halfheartedly responds anyway. More out of
          a sense of wifely duty than reciprocated passion.As they kiss, Carnegie pushes her excitedly against the wall
          and feverishly begins unbuckling his pants.INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - DAYThe original customers have now been joined by the four
          bikers, who sit at their own table drinking a clear and
          pungent moonshine-type liquor from a shared jar.Eli enters. All eyes are on him immediately, regarding him
          with guarded interest as he pulls up a stool at the bar.The BARTENDER approaches, looks him up and down. Suspicious.BARTENDEROutlander? Let me see-29.Eli raises his hand as before. Holds it outstretched, steady.BARTENDERWhat'll it be?Eli places the canteen on the bar.ELIWater.BARTENDERThat's the good stuff. Gotta eat
                    into my own ration to sell it - so
                    I don't sell it cheap.Eli takes off his scarf and puts it on the bar. The bartender
          takes it and looks it over. Not particularly impressed.BARTENDERThat'll get you maybe half-way.The bartender spies Eli's silver Saint Christopher pendant.BARTENDERWhat about that?Eli stuffs the pendant inside his shirt. No way that's for
          sale. Instead, he reaches into his coat and produces the fur
          pelts he skinned from the dead cat, lays them out on the bar.ELIThat's the best I got.The bartender takes a pelt and examines it. The mangy cat
          leaps up onto the bar and approaches. Sniffs at the pelts
          with suspicion and HISSES at Eli.Eli shoos the cat off the bar with a wave of his hand. At the
          biker's table Hog watches this, not happy about this.Satisfied with the pelts, the bartender gathers them up along
          with the scarf, then turns away toward the back room.BARTENDERSolara!A TEENAGE GIRL emerges from the back. No older than 16 or 17.
          Dressed in unflattering work clothes, face grimy, blonde hair
          tied back in a ponytail. But even through all this, it's
          clear she is a strikingly beautiful young woman.The bartender takes Eli's canteen and hands it to Solara
          along with a RATION CARD he keeps around his neck.30.BARTENDERTake this out back and get it
                    filled.Solara takes the canteen, pausing for a moment to look Eli up
          and down. Unsure quite what to make of him, but intrigued.
          There's something about him she can't put her finger on...He doesn't look back at her. She turns and exits.EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUSSolara exits via the Palladium's STAGE DOOR and walks across
          the busy street to where TWO OF CARNEGIE'S ARMED MEN stand
          guard around an ENCLOSURE OF CHAIN-LINK FENCE TOPPED WITH
          RAZOR WIRE. TOWNSFOLK wait in line with bowls and buckets.One of the guards recognizes Solara and lets her cut to the
          front of the line. He punches two holes in her ration card
          and lets her inside the chain-link enclosure.Inside is an OLD RUSTED SPIGOT attached to a pipe emerging
          from the earth. Solara cranks hard on the handle - it takes a
          few pulls before the water comes, and then only at a weak
          trickle; it will take a while to fill the canteen.INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - CONTINUOUSAs Eli sits at the bar, a SHADOW comes into view and looms
          large over him. Hog is standing behind him, glaring, cutting
          a menacing figure in his armored cycle leathers.Solara senses trouble brewing and moves off, taking Eli's
          canteen away into the back room.HOGThat was my cat.Eli doesn't turn. Just looks straight ahead. Impossible to
          read him behind those mirrored goggles. Utterly inscrutable.ELIFine specimen.HOGI saw you push him off the bar.ELII didn't push him.HOGYou raised your hand at him.31.ELISorry. It won't happen again.The bartender looks at Hog nervously.BARTENDERHey, how about another drink, Hog?HOGThat cat's been comin' in here for
                    nigh on two years. It got more
                    right to be here than you. Who the
                    fuck do you think you are?ELII don't want any trouble.Hog grabs him by the arm.HOGWell, that's too bad, `cause-Blink. Suddenly Hog's head is pinned to the bar by nothing
          more than Eli's thumb. Pressed deep into a nerve cluster in
          his neck. Eli leans in close as Hog whimpers, paralyzed.ELII know you. Murderer of innocent
                    travelers on the road. You're going
                    to spend eternity drowning in a
                    lake of fire for the things that
                    you've done. Did you know that?The other bikers stand and approach, the OTHER CUSTOMERS
          following suit. Eli senses the trouble gathering behind him.ELIYou go on back to your table and
                    I'll be on my way. All right?It's all Hog can do to just barely nod his head. Eli releases
          his thumb. Hog staggers backward, gasping for breath.Eli stands and makes toward the door, but the bikers and
          other patrons have moved to block his exit.BURLY PATRONYou push Hog, you push all of us.Eli sighs, looks down at the floor. He's been pushed one time
          too many today. For the first time, we see anger in his face.32.ELICursed be the ground because of
                    you. By toil shall you eat of it.
                    Thorns and thistles shall it sprout
                    for you. From the ground were you
                    taken. For dust you are.The patrons look at Eli strangely. Who is this guy?Eli reaches back and draws the samurai sword. Carves a line
          in the dirt at his feet with the tip of the blade.ELIAnd to dust you shall return.INT. PALLADIUM - CARNEGIE'S BEDROOM - DAYCarnegie has Claudia pinned against the wall, his pants
          bunched around his ankles, ass bared as he pounds away at
          her. Not making love. This is mechanical, loveless sex.Claudia stares vacantly over his shoulder into space as
          Carnegie thrusts into her again and again. Deeply
          uninterested, just waiting for it to be over.Suddenly, we hear a CRASH O.S. Carnegie stops and listens.CARNEGIEDid you hear that? What was that?Claudia sees an opening to get out of this.CLAUDIAMaybe you should go check.BEAT. Carnegie keeps listening. Then comes another CRASH.CARNEGIEWhat in the hell is going on?He pulls up his pants, grabbing a RIFLE propped by the door
          as he rushes out. Claudia just stands there for a moment,
          then reaches down and pulls up her panties.She moves from the wall and makes her way across the room,
          feeling her way with her hands, gazing off into nothingness.
          Only now do we finally realize that she is BLIND.INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - CONTINUOUSCarnegie emerges from the bedroom onto the balcony. Looks
          down over the railing - and is stunned by what he sees.33.CHAOS in the bar below. Eli cutting a one-man swath of mayhem
          through the dozen brawlers. Most already lie dead. TWO MORE
          MEN ATTACK Eli and are effortlessly felled by his sword.Carnegie rushes hurriedly along the landing, banging loudly
          on the doors of the upstairs rooms.CARNEGIEGet your asses out here!ON ELI. Surrounded by the dead, only one man left standing.
          Hog. He backs away as Eli circles him like a predator. Sword
          held ready, the blade glistening with dark red blood.SOLARA re-emerges from the back room with Eli's refilled
          canteen. She stops and emits a horrified GASP when she sees
          the bloody carnage laid out in the bar before her.She watches, mortified, as Eli moves toward the helpless,
          terrified Hog, going in for the kill. Raising his sword...Suddenly, Solara steps forward and CRIES OUT:SOLARAStop!Eli FREEZES. Sword hanging in the air, poised to strike. He
          turns his head to where Solara stands behind the bar.SOLARAPlease don't.BEAT as Eli considers. He looks back at Hog, still completely
          at his mercy... and then LOWERS THE SWORD.ELIGo.HOG(CONFUSED)...What?ELIIt ain't for me to judge you. Your
                    time for that's gonna come. Believe
                    me. Now go on. Get out of here.Hog stumbles backward through the door, into the sunlight.
          Eli moves toward Solara, who stands petrified behind the bar.
          Reaches out and gently pries the canteen from her loose grip.ELIThank you.34.In the exitway, Hog turns back inside, grabbing up a BROKEN
          BOTTLE from the bloody floor as he goes.Hog rushes Eli from behind. Solara sees him coming and goes
          to SCREAM - but before any sound can come, Eli flips his
          sword backward and Hog runs right onto it, SKEWERING HIMSELF.BEAT. Hog just stands there for a moment, eyes wide, frozen
          in shock. His fingers go limp, dropping the bottle.He slides off the sword and collapses to the floor, dead.Eli wipes the sword clean and sheathes it. Looks around at
          the bloodied, fallen bodies. Then back at Solara.ELII'm sorry for all the mess.As he turns and heads toward the door:CARNEGIE (O.S.)Hold it right there.Accompanied by the sound of MULTIPLE GUNS COCKING.Carnegie is on the landing, training his rifle down at Eli.
          Alongside him, FIVE GUNMEN do the same. They've got him cold.INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOXCarnegie sits at his desk, the huge auditorium and stage area
          visible behind him. Eli stands before him. Around him are the
          other gunmen, who keep their weapons trained on him.Standing at Carnegie's side are REDRIDGE and CLAUDIA.CARNEGIESo, who are you?ELINobody. A walker in the outland.CARNEGIEI've met walkers before. Not a
                    particularly civilized bunch. Some
                    have even taken to eating their own
                    kind, did you know that? You
                    wouldn't be one of those savages
                    now, would you?Carnegie's gunmen look him over, inspecting him warily.CARNEGIE GUNMANHe ain't got the shakes.35.Carnegie's confident gaze remains fixed on Eli throughout.CARNEGIEGood. This is a civilized town.
                    Under God. Do you know what that
                    means?Eli can't help but react at the mention of that word.CARNEGIEIt means we have laws here. Laws
                    set down long before any of us ever
                    walked this earth. And one of them
                    is, you don't eat the flesh of your
                    brother. Else you're no better than
                    an animal. And not welcome here.Eli doesn't respond. Just stands there in Carnegie's gaze.CARNEGIESo what's your business here,
                    friend? Walkers don't usually come
                    into town less they want something.ELII had a battery needed charging and
                    a canteen needed filling. I didn't
                    come here looking for trouble.Barely noticeable, Carnegie gestures to one of the gunmen,
          who nods in acknowledgement and leaves.CARNEGIEWell, you sure as hell found it. Do
                    you know who I am?ELINo.CARNEGIEMy name's Carnegie. I own this bar.
                    I own the whole town. You've never
                    heard of me?ELIThat's you out there on the street.CARNEGIERemarkable likeness, isn't it?
                    You'd never guess half the men who
                    built it were blind. A small
                    tribute from a grateful people. I
                    was deeply touched.36.ELIYou had slaves build you a monument
                    to yourself?The mention of that word rankles Carnegie. He walks around
          the desk toward Eli, waves an admonishing finger at him.CARNEGIEDon't call them slaves. That's an
                    old word. I'm not a slaver. I'm
                    trying to help these people.Carnegie can't help himself - once again he is in his natural
          element, spinning the argument his way, pitching. Selling.CARNEGIEIn the outland the sightless are
                    preyed upon like sick animals. Here
                    at least they're protected. They do
                    the essential work others don't
                    want. And in return they eat, they
                    drink, they survive. Last year, a
                    couple of them even got married -
                    performed the ceremony myself.(BEAT)You see, I'm not exploiting these
                    people - I'm saving them! Any one
                    of them is free to leave whenever
                    they wish. But here they stay. And
                    they thank me every single day for
                    their salvation!An impressive, impassioned performance. He sounds just like
          an old-school TV evangelist. But Eli is unmoved.ELIIt's none of my business what you
                    do here. Like you said, it's your
                    town. I just want to be on my way.CARNEGIEWhat's your name, walker?Eli doesn't respond. Just stands there.CARNEGIEAll right, I guess we just call you
                    Walker. Don't see too many folks
                    your age these days. You lived in
                    the world before? You can read?ELII read every day.37.CARNEGIEThat's good. Good man. We educated
          folk, we need to stick together, if
          we're ever going to rebuild this

          we're the future.ELIWhat do you want with me?CARNEGIEStraight to the point. I like that.
          Fact is, you could be in a lot of

          You walk in here, armed, and the
          next thing a dozen of my good
          citizens are dead. I've hanged men
          for less. I could hang you.(BEAT)Or, you could come work for me.ELIWhat?CARNEGIEI never once saw anyone handle
          themselves the way you did down
          there in that bar. I don't know
          where you learned it, but I sure as
          hell could use it.ELII'm not interested.CARNEGIEPeople who work for me can live
          better than any walker ever
          dreamed. Real beds, clean water,
          hot food. Women, even. You could do
          a lot worse, my friend.ELII'm not your friend. And I'm not
          staying. I got someplace I need to
          be. Out west.CARNEGIEWest? There is nothing west. It's
          all gone, a long time ago.ELII've been told different.38.CARNEGIEBy who?Eli doesn't reply. Carnegie smiles, dials up the charm.CARNEGIEAll right, look. I'm going to make
                    you an offer of goodwill. Stay the
                    night, think it over. Try a little
                    local hospitality. We'll talk again
                    in the morning. If you're still not
                    interested, you're free to go. No
                    hard feelings.ELIThank you for your offer. But I'd
                    prefer to just leave right now. So
                    you can either let me out of here,
                    or I can kill my way out.The gunmen bristle, exchange nervous looks. Carnegie appears
          unfazed. He smiles. BEAT. He looks to the gunman at the door.CARNEGIELet him go.The gunman opens the door. Eli turns and exits.INT. ENGINEER WORKSHOP - DAYThe engineer stands behind the counter, looking worried. His
          heart sinks when he sees Eli enter.ENGINEEROh, shit...ELIHow's my battery?ENGINEERIt's, uh... it's gonna take a
                    little longer than I thought.ELIHow much longer?ENGINEERIt's gotta charge overnight. You,
                    uh, you can always stay here in
                    town, pick it up in the morning.Eli leans in a little closer. He smells a rat.39.ELIYou remember what I said would
                    happen if I came back here and you
                    didn't have my battery?ENGINEERIt's right here! It's just gonna
                    take a while longer. I swear.Eli looks at the engineer. Hard to be certain, but he's
          pretty sure he's lying. Somebody got to him.INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOXA VIOLENT COMMOTION is heard from down the hall. Suddenly one
          of Carnegie's henchmen comes flying into view as he is THROWN
          HARD INTO A WALL and slumps to the floor, unconscious.Eli storms into the box, pissed. MORE GUARDS rush in behind
          him. Carnegie, seated behind his desk, waves the guards off
          as he stands to greet Eli, smiling ingratiatingly as ever.CARNEGIEI knew you'd reconsider.ELIYeah? How'd you know that?CARNEGIENone of the walkers I've seen come
                    here from the outland were ever
                    what you'd call smart. I mean all
                    those years out there alone on the
                    road, some with their brains half-
                    fried from eating each other - it's
                    understandable why you people
                    aren't the brightest bulbs in the
                    box. But I never met one so dumb
                    that he'd turn down a meal and a
                    bed if it was offered.ELISo you didn't send someone across
                    the street to the engineer?CARNEGIEEngineer? I don't know what you're
                    talking about. If there's something
                    wrong, maybe I can help.Carnegie is a practiced liar. Much more difficult to read.40.CARNEGIEThis is Redridge. He's kind of my
                    right-hand man around here.Redridge - one of the two men who chased Eli into the room -
          steps forward. He regards Eli with a distrustful eye.CARNEGIEHe'll show you to your room.INT. PALLADIUM - GUEST BEDROOM - DUSKRedridge opens the door and ushers Eli inside.It's another of the dressing rooms converted into a bedroom,
          less well-appointed than Carnegie's own. A threadbare rug.
          Bed with relatively clean sheets. A sink for washing.REDRIDGEEnjoy your stay. There'll be
                    someone outside your room all
                    night. If you need anything.Redridge smirks and closes the door, leaving Eli alone. Eli
          paces across the room. Finally sits down on the creaky old
          bed. Trying to figure out how he managed to get stuck here.He unshoulders his pack, sets it down. Lies down on the bed.
          It's been a while since he felt a real bed on his back.A KNOCK at the door. Eli gets quickly to his feet.ELIHello?The door opens and CLAUDIA enters. Carrying a metal tub of
          water in both hands and, atop that, a dinner tray.CLAUDIAI have this for you. Water for
                    washing and some food.Eli just stands there. Totally unfamiliar with this kind of
          situation, it's been too long. She smiles, embarrassed.CLAUDIAWell... are you going to take it?ELIOh. Thank you.He takes the stuff from her, sets it on the table.41.CLAUDIAYou're very welcome.We get the impression that Claudia is as unfamiliar with this
          kind of polite interaction as Eli. But she likes it.CLAUDIAIt'll be dark soon.She strikes a match and lights the oil lamp on the table. The
          room is lit by its flickering glow.CLAUDIACan I get you anything else?ELINo, thank you.CLAUDIAWell. Have a good night.As she turns for the door:ELIYou're Carnegie's woman?CLAUDIAWhy do you ask?ELIJust making conversation is all.
                    Haven't had one of those in a
                    while. Not a real one, leastways.Claudia smiles. Neither has she.CLAUDIAHe found me in the outland. I was
                    sixteen, my family had been...
                    well, they were gone. There was
                    just me and my baby.ELIYou had a baby?CLAUDIAI'd met some men on the road. Bad
                    men. They...BEAT. She trails off, struggling with this unhappy memory.
          Eli gets it, raises a hand reassuringly.ELIIt's all right.42.CLAUDIAI was on the road for a year after
                    that. I couldn't feed myself, let
                    alone my little girl. And then Bill
                    found us and he promised he'd take
                    care of us. He told me he was going
                    to make a place where we could be
                    safe. And he did. He did all that.
                    He built this whole town. He kept
                    us safe. And he raised that child
                    like she was his own. He's been so
                    good to both of us. He saved us,
                    really.There's a bittersweet quality to Claudia's words. As though
          there is more to the story than she is telling.Eli pulls out a chair at the table, offers it to her.ELIYou want to eat some?She smiles and sits. Eli sits across from her.ELIWhen did you go blind? In the war?
                    You get caught in a flash?CLAUDIANo, I was born this way. I think
                    I'm lucky like that.ELILucky?CLAUDIAIt's not like I ever knew what I'm
                    missing. I was already used to
                    being like this by the time... by
                    the time it all happened. So I got
                    around pretty good even when I was
                    on my own. And now it's easy. I
                    know every creaky old floorboard in
                    here, and it's not like I ever go
                    any place else. Bill would never
                    allow it. He worries about me so
                    much.Again, bittersweet. The sense that Claudia feels trapped.
          Thinking about it begins to upset her. She gets up.CLAUDIAI should go. He'll be wondering
                    where I am.43.Eli stands, escorts her to the door and opens it.CLAUDIAThank you. I enjoyed our
                    conversation.ELISo did I.Eli closes the door, then sits back at the table.INT. PALLADIUM - CARNEGIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHTCarnegie washes, looking at himself in the old dressing-room
          mirror. He sees Claudia enter the room in its dim reflection.CARNEGIEYou took your time in there. How
                    long does it take to deliver a
                    plate of food and some water?A subtly accusing tone. It makes Claudia nervous.CLAUDIAHe wanted to talk.CARNEGIEOh? What about?CLAUDIANothing really. He asked me what it
                    was like to be blind.CARNEGIEHe tell you anything about him?CLAUDIANo. I don't think he likes to talk
                    about himself much.CARNEGIEYeah, I got that.Claudia moves to the bedside, begins to undress.CLAUDIAI don't think he's going to change
                    his mind by morning. I don't think
                    he's going to stay.CARNEGIEWhat makes you say that?44.CLAUDIAJust strikes me as the kind of man
                    who's of a mind, is all. Doesn't
                    seem like the type to go changing
                    it once it's set.CARNEGIEWell, we'll just see about that.CLAUDIAYou saw him. He's not like the
                    others. You won't be able to smooth-
                    talk him and wrap him around your
                    finger like you usually do.CARNEGIEWho said anything about me?(BEAT)I'm sending Solara.Claudia reacts suddenly to this. Shocked and angry.CLAUDIAYou're doing what?CARNEGIEYou know how often these walkers
                    get laid? Never. Least not by
                    anything living or willing. Girl
                    like her can be very persuasive.CLAUDIAYou can't send her in there with
                    him. He's dangerous, he's a killer!CARNEGIEYou went in there readily enough.CLAUDIAThat's different. Solara's just a
                    child, she can't-Carnegie sighs, tiring of this.CARNEGIEShe's a grown woman now, Claudia.
                    Sooner or later you're going to
                    have to accept that. She has to
                    earn her keep around here, same as
                    the rest of us.CLAUDIABy working as a whore? That's all
                    you think she's fit for?45.CARNEGIEWe've each been given a talent to
                    help us make our way in this world.
                    Some people's gift is more evident
                    than others. Solara's sure as hell
                    is.Claudia looks at Carnegie in disgust.CLAUDIAWhat kind of a man are you?Now it's Carnegie's turn to get angry. He rounds on her
          menacingly. She backs off as he approaches.CARNEGIEI'm the kind of man who'd pull a
                    helpless blind girl off the road, a
                    girl who'd been beaten and raped,
                    and give her a place where she can
                    live without fear! Without me you'd
                    be just another no-eye, lying dead
                    in the outland, picked clean by the
                    buzzards, or shoveling dirt down
                    there with the others. That's the
                    kind of man I am!He has her against the wall, his face just inches from hers.CLAUDIAI don't live without fear. I
                    haven't for a long time now.Carnegie calms himself, backs off. Claudia goes to leave.CARNEGIEWhere are you going?CLAUDIAI'm not going to let you do this.Carnegie surges forward and pins Claudia to the wall.CARNEGIEYou're not going to let me?(BEAT)Nobody tells me what I can and
                    can't do in my own town. Nobody. I
                    built this world, and I am God
                    here! So don't go thinking about
                    screwing with my plans. You know
                    how this works. Solara goes against
                    me, you get hurt. You go against
                    me, she gets hurt.46.He releases his grip on her.CARNEGIESo let's not see anybody get hurt.
                    Okay?He speaks more softly now. As he strokes his hand tenderly
          through Claudia's hair, a tear runs down her cheek.INT. PALLADIUM - GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHTDark outside, but the room is brightly lit by the glow of the
          oil lamp. Eli sits up on his bed, quietly reading the old
          leather-bound book from his backpack.Another KNOCK at the door. Eli jumps up and hurriedly hides
          the book inside his shirt.ELICome in.The door opens to reveal Solara. Looking very different than
          she did before. Cleaned up and wearing a flowery summer
          dress, blonde hair let down over her shoulders. Stunning.Unlike everyone else we have met, she seems - physically, at
          least - totally unscarred by the horrors of the times. Far
          too beautiful a thing to belong in a world like this.SOLARAHi. Can I come in?ELISomeone was already here with food
                    and water. I got everything I need.SOLARAYou sure about that?She glides into the room, closing the door. She's good. Very
          seductive. Eli is totally disarmed in her presence.SOLARAIt's too bright in here. Mind if I
                    turn it down a little?She doesn't wait for an answer. Moves to the table and turns
          down the oil lamp. A darker, more seductive lighting scheme.SOLARAThat's better. I'm Solara. You're
                    Walker, right?47.ELINo. My name's Eli.SOLARAThat short for something? Elias?ELIElijah.SOLARAElijah. I never heard that one
                    before. It's kinda cute.She sits on the bed, kicks her legs playfully. Her light
          cotton dress revealing in all the right places. The
          silhouette of her body bathed in the seductive glow of the
          oil lamp. No red-blooded man on earth could resist her.ELILook, I don't mean to be rude. But
                    I'm really not interested.SOLARAYou sure about that? It gets mighty
                    lonely out there on the road.She leans over on the bed, resting on her elbow. Her hair
          cascades down. God damn, she looks good.SOLARAIf you're worried about money, this
                    is all paid for. The whole night.ELIIt's not that. You're a very nice
                    girl. But I'm not that kind of man.She slides off the bed, approaches him. Begins to work the
          buttons of his shirt.SOLARAThey're all that kind of man.
          He moves her hand away. Gently pushes her back a step.ELII'm not.She is stunned. No man has ever turned her down before. And
          then she seems a little insulted.SOLARAThey told me you were crazy. Maybe
                    they were right.48.Eli opens the door for her.ELII'm sorry. Good night.Suddenly all her other emotions give way to fear. She moves
          to the door and slams it shut again. Looks Eli in the eye.SOLARAPlease don't make me leave. I have
                    to stay the night. If I don't...ELIIf you don't, what?SOLARAHe'll hurt my mom.ELIWho will? Carnegie?She nods, fighting back a tear. This angers Eli.ELIMaybe he and I oughta have words.He goes for the door handle, but she stops him.SOLARANo! Please, don't!ELIHe's hurting you. He's hurting your
                    mother. He's-SOLARAHe's my dad.BEAT. Eli moves his hand away from the door.SOLARALook, if you want to help me, just
                    let me stay here tonight. We don't
                    have to do anything. I'll sleep on
                    the floor. Tomorrow you can tell my
                    dad that we had a good time. I'll
                    be no trouble, I swear.She looks up at Eli imploringly. Transformed. No longer the
          teenage sex kitten. Now she's just a frightened little girl.ELIYou want to have a conversation?49.She smiles, wiping the tear from her cheek.LATEREli and Solara sit together on the bed. A silent BEAT. At
          first, it appears as though they have nothing to say.ELIYou know, you don't have to be
                      afraid of me. What happened down
                      there in the bar...SOLARAI'm not afraid of you. I know you
                      didn't start that trouble. When I
                      first saw you, I knew you weren't
                      the type to go looking for it.ELIHow'd you know that?SOLARAMy mom says I'm a good judge of
                      character. She says I can read
                      people. That I know a good man when
                      I see one.She smiles. Eli is surprised to find himself smiling back.SOLARASo... you're pretty old, right?Eli smiles, amused by the bluntness of the question.SOLARAI'm sorry. I just mean, I haven't
                      seen too many people your age. How
                      old are you exactly?ELIYou know, I don't rightly remember.SOLARABut you're old enough. I mean, you
                      remember what it was like? In the
                      world before?Eli nods.SOLARAWhat was it like?Eli thinks about this. Dredging through old, old memories.50.ELIBetter than this.(BEAT)People lived longer back then.
                    Longer than me. Some were more than
                    a hundred years old.Solara smiles like she's having her leg pulled.SOLARACome on.ELII swear, it's true. Nowadays it's
                    not the same. If you're sick or
                    you're weak or you're old you won't
                    last long out on the road.SOLARASo how come you have?BEAT. Eli thinks. Should he or shouldn't he?ELICan I read you something?SOLARAWait. You can read?Eli pulls the book from his shirt. Solara's eyes widen.SOLARAAnd you have a book?ELINot just any book.For the first time we see that it's a KING JAMES BIBLE. An
          embossed GOLD CROSS on its old leather cover.Eli opens it up, scans the page with his finger until he
          finds the passage he's looking for.ELIThe Lord is my shepherd. I shall
                    not want. He makes me lie down in
                    green pastures. He leads me beside
                    still waters. He restores my soul.
                    He leads me in the paths of
                    righteousness.ON SOLARA as she listens to Eli read. Transfixed.51.ELIThough I walk through the valley of
                    the shadow of death, I will fear no
                    evil. For you are with me. Your rod
                    and your staff, they comfort me.
                    You prepare a table before me in
                    the presence of my enemies. You
                    anoint my head with oil. My cup
                    runs over. Surely goodness and
                    mercy shall follow me, all the days
                    of my life. And I will dwell in the
                    house of the Lord forever.SOLARAThat's beautiful. Did you write
                    that?ELI(SMILES)No.SOLARAWhat book is it from? Is it poetry?ELII guess you could think of it that
                    way. It's from the Holy Bible.SOLARAI never heard of it. What's it
                    about?BEAT as Eli thinks. How on earth to answer that?ELIIt's about love, and forgiveness,
                    and life and death, and mercy, and
                    revenge, and the beginning and the
                    end of the world. I guess it's
                    about a little bit of everything.SOLARACan I see?She reaches out for the book but he snatches it away.SOLARAWhat? I'm not going to do anything.ELII'm sorry. I'm charged to protect
                    this book. I can't trust it with
                    anyone. Not even for a while.52.SOLARAWhat's so special about that book?BEAT. Eli runs his fingers across the embossed gold cross on
          the beat-up leather cover.ELIIt's the last one. There are no
                    other books like this. All the
                    others are gone - destroyed by the

                    I just wandered on the road like
                    most everybody else. There were
                    still a lot of people around back
                    then, in the beginning. I didn't
                    really know what I should do or
                    where I was going. I was just
                    moving from place to place, trying
                    to stay alive. And then one day I
                    heard this voice. I don't know how
                    to explain it, it's like it was
                    coming from inside me. But I could
                    hear it, clear as day. Clear as I
                    can hear you talking to me now.SOLARAWhat did it say?ELIIt led me to this place, I don't
                    really know where. And I found this
                    book buried deep under some rubble.
                    No way no-one was ever going to
                    find it if they didn't know exactly
                    where to look.SOLARABut you knew because the voice told
                    you?ELIThat's right. And that voice told
                    me to carry the book west.(MORE)53.ELI (cont'd)
                    It told me that a path would be
                    laid out before me, that I'd be led
                    to a place where this book would be
                    safe. It told me I'd be protected
                    against anyone or anything that
                    tried to stand in my way. If only I

                    knows how. Only my dad, and he
                    won't teach me. I think he likes
                    being the only one who can read. I

          cloth. She whips it away - to reveal ELI'S RAT nibbling on a
          piece of cheese. Solara SHRIEKS and backs away.The rat scurries down the table leg and leaps up onto Eli's
          shoulder, just as afraid of her as she is of it.ELIIt's okay, it's okay. He's with me.

          thing. When is the last time he had someone he could call a
          friend? He can't even remember.ELISure.She smiles. Giggles as the rat's whiskers tickle her ear.Eli breaks the cheese in two and gives half to Solara. She's
          about to eat but stops as Eli clasp his hands in prayer.ELIOur father, we thank you for this

          together and bowing her head.ELIWe thank you for a warm bed and a

          pistol-whip. Redridge appears nearby, his arm in a sling.REDRIDGEHe killed four of my men and walked
                    out of town without a scratch. They
                    shot off a hundred rounds at him
                    and he didn't get hit once. I never
                    even heard of anything like that.Carnegie doesn't appear to be listening. He is lost in a
          world of his own as he tends to the farm animals.CARNEGIEYou know, I always thought of
                    myself as a shepherd. Bringing
                    together the wayward and the lost.
                    Tending to my flock. But all the
                    things I want to do, I can't do
                    them on my own. The one thing I've
                    needed is the one thing that's
                    always been missing. Then one day
                    it walks right into town - so close
                    I can almost touch it - and then
                    walks right on out again.Carnegie finally looks up from his animals, at Redridge.67.CARNEGIEI want you to put a crew together
                    and go out after him.REDRIDGEHe's not going to work for you. I
                    think he's made that plain.CARNEGIEI'm not interested in him any more.
                    I only want the book he's carrying.REDRIDGEIf I'm gonna risk my ass hunting
                    down this maniac in the outland, I
                    need to know it's gonna be worth
                    it. I need to know what's so
                    special about this goddamn book.BEAT as Carnegie considers this.CARNEGIEYou have no idea. You're too young,
                    you don't remember the world
                    before. But I do. I remember.He turns back to his animals, summoning up old memories.CARNEGIEWhen I was a kid my parents used to
                    read that book every goddamn day.
                    My mother, she'd read it along with
                    this smooth-talking preacher on the
                    TV screen. They used to be able to
                    beam these guys right into your
                    house, into every house in the
                    world, through the air. Like magic.(BEAT)She worked two jobs and she sent
                    every spare penny she had to that
                    fucking guy on the TV. My old man,
                    he'd read that book, then he'd get
                    liquored up and kick my ass, tell
                    me all about the power and the
                    glory and how I was going to burn
                    forever in hell for the sins I was
                    born with. He made sure he beat it
                    into me good.He snaps out of his reverie and looks at Redridge.CARNEGIEDon't you see? It's not just any
                    book.(MORE)68.CARNEGIE (cont'd)
                    It has the power to motivate
                    people. It can give them hope, it
                    can terrify them. It can shape
                    them. Control them.(BEAT)Do you remember how I built this
                    town? It wasn't done with force,
                    and it wasn't done just with water.
                    It was done with the power of
                    words. I created this place out of
                    nothing, because people believed in
                    a promise that I sold to them.
                    Those guys on the TV, they were
                    richer than you could ever dream,
                    and it was all built the same way.
                    With words. With promises. And with
                    that book.(BEAT)That book is a weapon. Aimed right
                    at the hearts and minds of the weak
                    and the desperate. Just imagine
                    what I could do with it.REDRIDGEBoss... we're running out of water
                    and the people are running out of
                    patience. You're trying to tell me
                    that a book is going to keep them
                    in line?CARNEGIEOh, it'll do much more than that.
                    The water in this town may run dry,
                    but faith - that springs eternal!
                    And that faith will help turn this
                    town into a city. And this city
                    into a nation. It will help me
                    build a new world. In my image.
                    People will come from far and wide
                    to hear what's inside of it.
                    They'll follow me anywhere just to
                    get a taste of it. And they'll do
                    whatever I tell them.As usual, Carnegie's slick rhetoric has worked - Redridge has
          totally bought into it. Claudia, however, looks appalled.REDRIDGEAnd what if this book don't work?
                    What if it don't say what you want
                    it to say?69.CARNEGIEOh, it'll say what I want, I can
                    promise you that. Because I'm going
                    to rewrite it. I'll keep the parts
                    that work for me and make the rest
                    whatever I need it to be.(BEAT)A new bible, for a new world.He reaches out and takes Claudia by the hand.CARNEGIEWhat do you think, darling? A whole
                    new world, to do with as we will.
                    Won't that be grand?She smiles halfheartedly, but it's clear she is mortified.Carnegie turns back to Redridge.CARNEGIEFind that book.REDRIDGEHe has half a day on us already.CARNEGIESo use the motor pool.REDRIDGEThere ain't much gas in reserve.CARNEGIEWhatever there is, use it.Redridge nods and goes to leave.CLAUDIAWhat about Solara?BEAT. In all this excitement about the book, she had been
          completely forgotten about.CLAUDIAShe's still out there. With him.CARNEGIERight. Right. Of course. Bring her
                    back, too, if you can. But-REDRIDGEThe book. I know.70.Redridge turns and leaves. Claudia scowls at Carnegie, but he
          doesn't even notice, just goes back to feeding his animals.EXT. DESOLATE ROAD - DAYSolara wanders the road. She's tired. The sun beats down
          mercilessly. Nothing but desolation and wasteland all around.She comes to a FORK IN THE ROAD. Stops at the junction,
          unsure. Was this here before? She doesn't remember.There are no signs. Both paths look the same. Which one is
          which? She turns and looks back, looks around. She's lost.SOLARAShit. Shit.She alternates her finger between the two paths. Eeny-meeny-
          miney-moe. Picks a path and follows it, headed down the road.EXT. ROAD - DAYEli walks on. Slow and steady. His gaze, as ever, fixed
          firmly on the horizon. Takes a swig from his canteen.Suddenly, he STOPS and stands stock still in the center of
          the road. Impossible to know what he's thinking.He stands there for a long time.EXT. WASTELAND GAS STATION - DAYSolara comes upon an abandoned CHEVRON STATION. She doesn't
          remember passing this. Looks back up and down the road.SOLARAWhere the hell am I?There's a RUSTED CAR parked at one of the pumps. Like every
          other car we've seen, stripped of its tires and engine.She walks around to the driver's side. A PETRIFIED FEMALE
          BODY lies on the ground, half-in, half-out of the car.Solara claps her hand to her mouth and recoils, horrified.In the dead woman's hand is a dusty bottle of MINERAL WATER.
          Solara hesitates. Not wanting to get closer. But so thirsty.She braces herself, grimacing, and tries to take the bottle,
          but the dead woman's hand is closed tight around it. She
          pulls harder and wrenches it free. In the process she falls
          on her butt and flips the corpse over onto its back.71.In the other woman's arm, she has a SKELETAL BABY cradled to
          her bosom. It seems to be staring right at Solara.Solara SCREAMS and frantically shuffles backward away from
          it. Gets to her feet and runs across the forecourt.She stops by the station shop and rests against the wall,
          hyperventilating, heart pounding. Trying to get it together.She inspects the water in the bottle. It looks clean.
          Unscrews the cap with shaking hands and takes a sip.She SPITS IT BACK OUT, coughing. It's rank. Undrinkable.INT. WASTELAND GAS STATION - FOOD COURT - DAYSolara enters. Gloomy inside. Comprehensively looted. Empty
          shelves coated in thick sheets of dust.She moves further in, searching for something, anything. But
          the place has been gutted. There's nothing. She checks the
          wall of dead refrigerators. Shattered glass, all empty.She's never known desolation and emptiness like this. It's
          beginning to scare her. She wheels around in a panic.FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)Hello?Distant, calling from outside. Solara hears it and freezes.FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)Hello? Can anyone help me?EXT. WASTELAND GAS STATION - CONTINUOUSShe runs out across the forecourt, onto the road.A FEMALE FIGURE is hunched by the side of the road about
          fifty yards up ahead. Hard to see what she's doing from here.SLUMPED FEMALEHello? Is anybody there?Solara starts walking toward her.The woman has her back to Solara. She's on her knees,
          muttering to herself. Gathering objects up from the road.As Solara moves closer, we see that the woman is struggling
          with an UPTURNED SHOPPING CART. Stuck in a roadside ditch,
          its contents spilled out next to a few BRACKEN BUSHES.72.We see her face now. It's the SAME YOUNG WOMAN from before.
          The same shopping cart. The same trap.SOLARAAre you all right?The woman looks around, sees Solara standing nearby. She's
          shocked to see that it's a girl.YOUNG WOMANOh. Yes, I'm fine. Thank you. You
                      go along, I'll be okay.SOLARAYou look like you need some help.YOUNG WOMANNo, really! I'm fine. Really... I
                      need a man to help. Not you. You
                      just keep along. Please.The woman seems anxious to get rid of her. Tries to indicate
          the threat silently with her eyes, but Solara doesn't get it.SOLARAIt'll just take a minute.She steps into the ditch and starts to haul the cart out.YOUNG WOMANReally, it's fine! Please!Too   late. THREE ROAD BRIGANDS POUNCE FROM THE BUSHES. Every
          bit   as brutish and horrifying as the group that Eli killed on
          the   road in our opening. They grab Solara and drag her from
          the   road into the desert, screaming and kicking all the way.YOUNG WOMANLet her go! She ain't got nothing!The BRIGAND LEADER looks Solara up and down lustfully.BRIGAND LEADERI ain't too sure about that.Solara is reviled by the man. He's filthy, his stench
          overpowering. One eye missing, just a dark, empty socket. He
          licks his lips, revealing a mouth almost devoid of teeth.YOUNG WOMANThis wasn't the deal!The brigand leader lashes out and grabs her by the throat.73.BRIGAND LEADERShut your mouth, bitch. You oughta
                    be grateful you're getting a break.He releases her. She slumps to the dirt, whimpering.BRIGAND LEADERNever did care much for that dried-
                    up old snatch anyhow.He looks back to the struggling Solara.BRIGAND LEADERThis one, though... this one looks
                    fresh. You a virgin?She says nothing, just sobs helplessly.BRIGAND LEADERWell, let's find out.He unbuckles his pants, lets them drop to his ankles.We hear a sound. It's hard to place. Something like a THHUP.The brigand leader is frozen in shock. His face goes pale,
          the blood draining from it. The two bandits holding Solara
          look at their leader in dismay. Staring down at his crotch.A quiet whimper escapes from his lips as he looks down.There is an ARROW IMBEDDED IN HIS CROTCH. What was once down
          there is now just a bloody mess of mangled meat. More blood
          streams down his thighs. A real horror show.He staggers backward, shrieking. Hands shaking. Staring down
          at the awful wound from which the long arrow shaft extends.The two other brigands release Solara and whip around,
          scanning the horizon. They see nothing. One of them has a
          RIFLE. He unslings it and aims it frantically around.Then they both see it. Coming right at them. The most
          terrifying thing either has ever seen.ELI, WALKING TOWARD THEM FROM THE ROAD, OUT OF THE SUN. His
          silhouette distorted in the rippling heat. An avenging angel.He pulls another arrow and draws it back as the rifle bandit
          trains his weapon on him, finger tightening on the trigger.Eli SHOOTS. The arrow sails through the air and RIGHT INTO
          THE RIFLE BARREL. The feathers at the end of the shaft
          plugging the muzzle tight.74.Rifle bandit pulls the trigger. The gun EXPLODES, BLOWING HIS
          HANDS CLEAN OFF. He falls to the ground, screaming.Eli only had two arrows. He shoulders the bow and draws his
          sword. All the remaining brigand has is a small knife. The
          two now square off at arm's length. A hopeless mismatch.BEAT. The knife brigand hesitates, trembling. And then RUSHES
          ELI WITH THE KNIFE. Eli deftly sidesteps, flourishes the
          sword. So quick it almost seems like he didn't move at all.The knife bandit staggers forward a couple more steps. His
          hand goes limp and drops the knife.And then his HEAD FALLS BACKWARD like a Pez dispenser. Almost
          completely decapitated, but not quite. Blood fountains from
          the neck stump as his body falls to the dirt.Eli moves to the other two bandits who lay horribly wounded
          on the ground, but still breathing. He stands over their
          fallen bodies. They stare back up at him, helpless.He crouches down between them in the dust.ELII offer you both one final chance
                    in this life to seek forgiveness
                    for your sins so that your souls
                    may find salvation. Will you say
                    with me the act of contrition?The brigand leader defiantly spits blood at him.BRIGAND LEADERFuck you.Eli sighs. Stands and looks down on him without pity.ELISome might think it'd be most
                    fitting to leave you here like
                    this. Let you die slow in the sun.
                    But I know better. I know where
                    you're going. And the sooner you
                    get there, the sooner you'll get
                    what's coming to you.He plunges his sword into the bandit leader, finishing him
          off. Pulls the arrow from his crotch and wipes it clean.He turns to the other man, raising his sword.RIFLE BANDITWait!75.Eli pauses, sword hovering over him, poised to strike.RIFLE BANDITI want to say it. I want to be
                    forgiven.Eli crouches once more by his side.ELIRepeat after me. Oh God, I am
                    heartily sorry for having offended
                    thee, and I detest all my sins.The bandit follows along with Eli, mouthing the words
          quietly. The life ebbing from him with each moment.ELII firmly resolve, with the help of
                    thy grace, to confess my sins, and
                    do penance, and to amend my life.
                    Amen.RIFLE BANDITAmen...His eyes roll back as his final breath leaves him. Dead. Eli
          signs a cross over his body, then stands and walks away.Solara sits on the ground nearby, a wreck. Eli approaches and
          gathers her up in his arms. She clings on to him tightly.SOLARAYou came back for me.ELIWhat are friends for?She laughs, a tear rolling down her cheek. Grips him tighter.He helps her up and escorts her back to the road.ELIThis is the deal. You keep up. You
                    pull your weight. You fall behind,
                    I can't help you. Okay?SOLARAOkay.She looks back at the young woman still slumped in the dirt.SOLARAWhat about her?76.ELIThere's nothing can be done for
                    her.They walk on down the road.EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAYMETAL GARAGE DOORS roll back to reveal darkness within.A PAIR OF HEADLIGHTS fires up. Full beam right at us.A VEHICLE roars out of the darkness onto the street. Heavily
          modified with plate armor and turret-mounted weapons. But its
          original form still recognizable underneath.It's a HONDA ODYSSEY minivan. Once the #1 choice of soccer
          moms, transformed now into an armored personnel carrier.Another minivan roars from the garage behind it. A DODGE
          GRAND CARAVAN, similarly customized and armed to the teeth.THREE MORE CARS follow. As eclectic an assortment as you
          could imagine. A MINI COOPER. FORD EXPLORER. A PRIUS. Each
          adorned with plate armor and weapons.In the lead Minivan is REDRIDGE, heavily armed. He nods to
          the DRIVER, who guns the engine.The fleet of armored vehicles moves out, kicking up a great
          funnel of dust in their wake as they roar out of town.EXT. DESERT - DAYLate afternoon. The sun hangs low on the horizon. We're far
          from the road. Nothing but scrub brush and a few PRAIRIE DOG
          BURROWS dotted around.A PRAIRIE DOG pops its head up, scans the horizon. Sniffing
          the air, whiskers twitching... and is SKEWERED BY AN ARROW.Thirty yards away, one of the pieces of scrub brush appears
          to COME ALIVE. And then we realize it is Eli's GHILLIE SUIT,
          camouflaging both he and Solara beneath it.Eli casts off the camouflage net and walks toward the dead
          prairie dog. Solara just stands there, appalled.SOLARAYou killed it! That cute little
                    thing!Eli picks up the dead animal by the scruff.77.ELIIt's good eating, is what it is.He yanks out the bloody arrow. Solara looks away.When she turns back, Eli is standing right there, holding the
          dead animal in front of her face. She YELPS in surprise and
          staggers backward, falling on her butt.SOLARAThat's not funny.ELIIf you're going to be on the road,
                    you can't be picky about what you
                    eat. You eat what's there to eat.SOLARAI'm not eating that.ELI(SHRUGS)More for me.EXT. WASTELAND CAVE - DUSKEli and Solara sit in the mouth of a desert cave, around a
          flickering campfire. The prairie dog roasts on a spit.Eli digs his knife into the carcass, the blade comes out
          clean. It's done. He clasps his hands together and gazes down
          penitently at the ground.ELIFather, we thank you for your
                    generosity in providing us with
                    this meal. Bless this food to our
                    use and us to thy service, and keep
                    us ever mindful of the needs of
                    others. Amen.Eli carves off a piece of meat. Juicy and succulent. He bites
          into it, teasing Solara by making a show of how good it
          tastes. He feeds a piece to the rat perched on his shoulder.Solara tries to appear uninterested, but she's starved.SOLARAWhat does that taste like?He takes another bite, thinks on this as he chews.ELITastes like chicken.78.She tries to fight the temptation to try it... but she can't.
          She reaches out and tears off a piece. Sniffs at it, takes a
          small bite... then quickly wolfs down the rest. Eli smiles.As she eats, she gestures toward Eli's Saint Christopher.SOLARAWhat is that?Eli reaches up and touches his hand to it.ELIIt's a Saint Christopher medal.SOLARAWho's Saint Christopher? Is he a
                    character from your book?Eli smiles and shakes his head.ELIChristopher was a man who lived a
                    long time ago. He wanted to be a
                    good man, he wanted to help people.
                    So he would stand by a river that
                    had no bridge and carry people
                    across. He was a big strong man and
                    there was no one he couldn't carry.Solara listens, rapt. Eli is a good storyteller.ELIThen one day a young child came to
                    the river and asked to be carried
                    across. Christopher tried to carry
                    him but he was too heavy. He was
                    just a small boy but he was heavier
                    than any man he had ever carried.
                    The boy explained that he was the
                    son of God, and that he was so
                    heavy because he bore all the sins
                    of the world. After that,
                    Christopher was able to carry him
                    across and when they got to the
                    other side the boy baptized him in
                    the river. And that's how he became
                    a saint. Later on, he was known as
                    the patron saint of travelers.SOLARAWhat is a saint, anyway?79.ELIIt's someone who spent their life
                    doing good things for others.
                    Enough that God himself took a
                    special interest in them.Solara looks at Eli tenderly, with admiration.SOLARASomeone like you.Eli looks away, down at the ground. He appears sad.ELINo. Not like me. Saints ain't
                    killers. And I done too much of
                    that. Spilled too much blood.BEAT. No words, just the flickering firelight.SOLARAWill you read me some more from the
                    book?ELIIt's late. You should get some
                    sleep. Maybe tomorrow.LATER - NIGHTThe fire down to its last embers. Eli sleeps next to his
          pack, half-hidden in the looming shadows of the cave. His hat
          and goggles hung up for the night on the hilt of his sword.Solara sleeps nearby... then opens her eyes. Not asleep after
          all. She looks over at Eli - his face hidden in shadow and so
          impossible to tell if he's asleep or awake.SOLARAEli?No response. Quietly, she moves forward, kneeling by his
          side. She opens his coat and checks the pockets. Empty.She goes deeper, peeling back the layers of clothing,
          stealthily frisking him. She finds something on his lapel,
          hidden under several layers, that causes her to stop.It's a RECTANGULAR PLASTIC BADGE. The red, white and blue
          colors faded and worn. It reads:WELCOME TO WAL-MARTMY NAME IS "ELI"HOW MAY I HELP YOU?80.She stares at it for a moment, not knowing what to make of
          it. Then moves on, continuing to pat him down.Whatever she's looking for is not here. She turns her
          attention to the backpack. Slowly, carefully, opens it up.There it is. THE BIBLE, wrapped carefully in its neat little
          package of cloth and twine. She reaches in for it.Suddenly, ELI'S HAND SHOOTS OUT AND GRABS HER BY THE WRIST.
          She cries out, startled. Eli sits up, his face just a dark
          shape in the shadows. For the first time he appears a little
          scary to Solara.ELIWhat are you doing?SOLARAYou scared me! I thought you were
                    asleep.ELIOn the road you sleep with one eye
                    open. I asked you what you were
                    doing.SOLARAI just wanted to see the book.ELIYou want to see the book, you ask
                    me. Nobody touches it but me. Ever.
                    Until it gets where it's going. Do
                    you understand?He's very forceful. She nods, a little afraid of him.ELITell me you understand!He grips her wrist tighter.SOLARAOkay! I understand! Ow!Eli releases her wrist. Takes the pack from her and closes it
          up. Pulls it closer to him and lies back down.ELIIt's no use to you anyway. You
                    don't know how to read it.81.SOLARAWell... now we have the time, maybe
                    you can teach me.ELIMaybe. Get some sleep.She lies back down beside him, but doesn't close her eyes.
          She just lies there, watching him.EXT. WASTELAND - DAWNThe sun rises out of the east. And out of the sun comes the
          FLEET OF ARMORED VEHICLES. Racing side-by-side down the road.The lead vehicle comes to a halt. A door opens and Redridge
          gets out. MORE ARMED MEN emerge from the other vehicles and
          follow him as he marches into the wasteland by the roadside.The DEAD BRIGANDS are splayed out in the dirt where Eli slew
          them. A FLOCK OF BUZZARDS is picking their bones clean.REDRIDGEHe's been here.Redridge looks at the footprints in the dirt headed from the
          bodies and back onto the road. Two sets of tracks.REDRIDGEThe girl's with him.He moves back to the cars.REDRIDGEMove out!The other men hold for a moment, still looking at the half-
          eaten bodies in the dirt. Redridge turns back.REDRIDGEI said move out!CARNEGIE GUNMANI heard this guy's protected
                    somehow, some... power from up
                    above. That there ain't nothing on
                    this earth can touch him.REDRIDGEHe's just a man. You put a bullet
                    in him, he'll go down like any
                    other. I don't want to hear no more
                    of this superstitious horseshit!82.Hesitantly, they make their way back to the vehicles. The
          cars gun their engines and move on down the road, past the
          abandoned Chevron station. Dust pluming in their wake.EXT. ROAD - DAYEli and Solara walk together, passing by a few burned-out
          buildings. It appears we might be headed toward a town.Solara looks up at the sweltering sun. Then around at her
          surroundings. Nothing but devastation and decay.SOLARAYou say you've been walking for
                    twenty-five years. Have you ever
                    considered that you might be lost?ELINo.SOLARABut how can you know? How can you
                    know this is the right way?ELII told you. My path has been laid
                    out before me.SOLARAYeah, but laid out by who?ELIBy Almighty God.SOLARAWell if this God guy's so mighty,
                    how come it's taking you so long to
                    get where you're going? Doesn't he
                    know the way?Eli wheels around and jabs a scolding finger at her.ELIYou want to stay on this road with
                    me, don't ever let me hear you take
                    his name in vain like that again.Solara is surprised by the severity of his reaction.SOLARASorry.Eli resumes walking.83.ELIGod has a reason for everything
                    being the way it is. It's not
                    always apparent to us. But it is
                    his plan nonetheless.SOLARASo, is he talking to you right now?
                    Telling you where to go?ELIIt's not like that. It's kinda hard
                    to explain. I'm guided by faith.SOLARAI don't know what that word means.BEAT as Eli thinks on how to explain it.ELIIt means you know something even
                    though you don't know it.Solara thinks about this, shakes her head.SOLARAThat doesn't make any sense at all.ELIIt doesn't have to.They walk on.EXT. HOUSE - DAYOn the outskirts of a small town that lies in ruins. Almost
          every building burned or reduced to rubble.Except for one SMALL HOUSE. The building is damaged and worn
          but in mostly decent condition. It stands out among its
          surroundings for being the only structure still intact.The windows are BARRED. The outer structure fortified with
          SHEET METAL and other custom patch-ups. The whole plot
          surrounded by a CHAIN-LINK FENCE TOPPED WITH RAZOR WIRE.Eli and Solara crouch behind a pile of rubble nearby.SOLARAI don't get it. It looks almost...
                    normal. Like nothing ever happened.
                    How can it still be out here?84.ELII don't know.SOLARAMaybe we should look inside. There
                    might be food.BEAT as Eli considers. Then stands and unhooks his shotgun.ELIStay behind me.They approach the house cautiously. Arrive at the perimeter
          fence. There's a gate held in place by a PADLOCK.Eli pulls a pair of BOLT-CUTTERS from his belt and snips the
          padlock free. Swings open the gate with a metallic SQUEAK.They move inside, up the garden path. Though the soil in the
          yard is dead, it's been carefully raked and tended. WEEDS
          arranged in thoughtful patterns, like real flowers.SOLARAThis is weird.ELIYeah.Eli steps forward, his foot planting on a CRACKED PAVING
          STONE that shifts almost imperceptibly under his feet.
          Accompanied by a barely audible SOUND. He looks down.ELIShit.SOLARAWhat?A ROPE NOOSE suddenly whips around their feet, tightening at
          their ankles and YANKING THEM UPSIDE-DOWN INTO THE AIR. Eli
          drops his shotgun to the ground.They hang there for a moment, twisting in the breeze.The front door to the house SWINGS OPEN to reveal...AN ELDERLY COUPLE. The woman's gray hair tied into a neat
          bun. The man bald, squinting through wire-frame glasses. They
          look like the couple from Grant Wood's "American Gothic."Instead of a pitchfork the man holds a 12-GAUGE RIOT SHOTGUN
          which he keeps trained from the hip on Eli and Solara.85.They step outside, regarding their new visitors carefully.
          The man seems more suspicious than his wife. He drags Eli's
          shotgun toward him with his foot, hands it to his wife.ELDERLY MANWho are you?ELIMy name is Eli. This is Solara.
                    We're travelers, that's all. We
                    don't mean you any harm.ELDERLY MANYou cut my padlock. I saw you.
                    Trying to break into our house.ELII'm sorry. We didn't think anybody
                    lived here. We thought it was
                    abandoned, like all the rest.This seems to annoy the man.ELDERLY MANTake a look around you. Look at
                    this yard. Does it look abandoned
                    to you?Clearly he's proud of the work he's done with the pitiful
          means at his disposal.ELINo, sir. I... like what you've done
                    with the place.ELDERLY MANWhat's your business here?ELINo business. We're sorry to have
                    troubled you. If you'll let us down
                    we'll happily be on our way.The wife steps forward, she's much warmer, less guarded.ELDERLY WOMANGeorge, look at them! They're not
                    robbers or road agents! One of
                    them's just a girl!ELDERLY MANSeen that before. Oldest trick in
                    the book.86.ELDERLY WOMANOh, stop! It's no trick. Let them
                    down!The woman glares at him. The husband reluctantly accedes and
          moves to the concealed trap apparatus. Releases the rope,
          dropping Eli and Solara to the ground in a heap.The old woman helps them to their feet. They shake off the
          noose from their ankles.ELDERLY WOMANI'm so sorry about my husband. We
                    so rarely get visitors these days,
                    he's suspicious of everybody.(BEAT)I'm Martha and this is my husband
                    George. Would you care for some
                    tea?Eli and Solara exchange a look. What the hell is this?INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAYIt's like something out of the world before. The interior is
          almost perfectly preserved. Chintzy couches. A mahogany
          table. A TV set in the corner. Lace curtains. Unreal.Eli and Solara sit on the couch, feeling self-conscious and
          looking entirely out of place in this cozy environment.George sits across from them on the couch, scowling at them
          inhospitably. The shotgun resting across his lap.Martha emerges from the kitchen, carrying a tray laden with a
          tea pot and old china cups. Cracked and faded, but intact.
          She places the tray on the coffee table and sits.MARTHAI'm afraid we don't have any cake
                    or biscuits for the tea. They ran
                    out some time ago.She lifts the tea port and pours into the cups. But it's not
          tea, only water. Somewhat murky water. Eli and Solara stare
          at the cups, unsure. Martha gestures toward them.MARTHAPlease.They raise their cups and take a sip. Martha watches eagerly.
          It's clearly a thrill for her to be doing something as
          civilized and elegant as serving "tea" to guests.87.MARTHAHow do you like it?ELIIt's.. uh...SOLARAIt's very good.Martha smiles, delighted. She lifts her own cup to her lips.
          HER HANDS TREMBLE, the cup rattling against the saucer.ELIHave you always lived here?MARTHAFor almost forty years now. This
                    home is our pride and joy, isn't
                    it, George?George just grunts. Not interested in conversation.MARTHAWe refused to leave, even during
                    the troubles. We said, didn't we
                    George, we said if we're going to
                    die anywhere, we're going to die
                    right here, in our own home.ELII don't understand how you've
                    survived out here this long.MARTHAWell, George is something of a
                    handyman, aren't you, dear? He did
                    a lot of work on the place, making
                    it safe. We may be old, but we're
                    resilient. We've had more than a
                    few who've tried to take this place
                    from us. Haven't we, George?GEORGEYes. Yes we have.He stands and moves toward the back door. Opens it up and
          beckons Eli and Solara to come look.EXT. HOUSE - BACK YARD - CONTINUOUSEli and Solara stand in the doorway, looking out on the yard.
          Solara is horrified by what she sees.88.The entire back yard is a GRAVEYARD. Maybe twenty human
          graves dug shallow into the earth. Some were dug long ago,
          others look like they're very recent.SOLARAAre these... graves?MARTHAOf course. It would be uncivilized
                    not to bury them. We're not
                    barbarians.GEORGEPlus, it's good for the soil.MARTHACome on back inside. I think I
                    might be able to rustle up some
                    sandwiches.George and Martha go back inside, leaving Eli and Solara
          gazing at the little graveyard.ELIWe have to get out of here.SOLARAThey look so sweet... I would never
                    have believed they were killers.ELIThey're worse than that.SOLARAWhat?ELIThey didn't just kill these people.(BEAT)They ate them.Solara is stunned.SOLARAThey what?ELIThere's a disease in the outland.
                    Spread by eating human meat. It
                    affects the brain. Dementia, loss
                    of motor function. Did you notice
                    the old woman's hands shaking?
                    She's got it. They've both got it.89.SOLARAOh my God...INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUSEli and Solara re-enter. Solara looks at George nervously.
          He's still carrying that shotgun.Martha's voice drifts in from the nearby KITCHEN.MARTHA (O.S.)I found some meat for those
                    sandwiches! Are you hungry?SOLARANo! Thank you!ELIWe really must be going.GEORGESo soon?An unnerving glint in his eye. Eli moves toward the door.ELIYes, I'm afraid so.As he gets to the door, George moves to intercept. Hard to
          tell if he's blocking his path or moving to open the door for
          him. A tense BEAT.Martha emerges from the kitchen.MARTHAAre you sure you won't stay?ELIYes. Thank you again for the tea.Eli stares George down. Reluctantly, George steps aside. Eli
          opens the door and escorts Solara outside.EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUSEli and Solara emerge into the sunlight. Walk down the garden
          path. And FREEZE IN THEIR TRACKS.THE ARMED VEHICLES ARE COMING. Driving toward them out of the
          horizon in a hazy cloud of dust.SOLARAOh no... it's my dad. It's his men.90.ELIAre you sure?SOLARAI recognize the cars.ELIBack inside.Eli bundles Solara back into the house. George stands in the
          doorway, squinting at the approaching convoy.INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUSGeorge follows them back in, furious.GEORGEWhat did you bring upon us?MARTHAGeorge? What's wrong?GEORGEA whole convoy of armed

                    Coming here for them! And they led
                    them right to us!Martha rushes to the window, pulls aside the lace curtain.
          Outside she sees the armored vehicles SCREECHING TO A HALT.The men spill out from the vehicles and take cover behind
          them, locking and loading weapons.MARTHAOh no they don't...She rushes across the room, teeth gritted with determination.GEORGEMartha, what are you doing?MARTHAI finally got this house just the
                    way I want it. I'm not going to let
                    anybody tear it apart!She goes to the couch and yanks off the seat cushions.
          Underneath is a WOODEN LID which she throws open to reveal:A HUGE CACHE OF WEAPONS. Automatic rifles. Shotguns. Pistols.
          Grenades. And enough ammunition for everything.91.She pulls out an M-60 MACHINE-GUN, slings the strap over her
          shoulder and locks in a CHAIN OF BULLETS. She looks like a
          post-apocalyptic Martha Stewart.SOLARAWhere did you get all this stuff?George pulls out an AK-47, slots in a magazine.GEORGETook `em off them who came looking

          UPSTAIRS WINDOW slides open.A CLOTH PACKAGE is tossed from the window. It lands in the
          dirt outside the perimeter fence a few yards from Redridge.Cautiously, he approaches. The package is wrapped in cloth
          and tied up with twine. It looks like Eli's bible.He picks it up and tugs at the twine, untying it. Folds away
          the cloth wrapping. Looks for a moment in puzzlement at the
          object, at the words written on the front of it.THIS SIDE TO FACE ENEMYIt's a MINIATURE CLAYMORE MINE. The small red light on top of

                      faith?She nods.Eli peeks out and FIRES OUT THE WINDOW, dropping one of the
          enemy gunmen with a crack shot. Ducks back down as the return
          fire impacts around him.94.ELIWe're going to get out of this

          now, six more still standing. No lessening of fire from
          inside the house. They're losing.Redridge races between the vehicles, ducking from gunfire
          until he makes it to the back of the Dodge Caravan. Pops the
          trunk and pulls out a ROCKET-PROPELLED GRENADE LAUNCHER.He sets it on his shoulder, rests on the trunk to steady his
          aim. And FIRES. The rocket screams toward its target, tearing
          through the chain fence and TEARING AN ENTIRE CORNER FROM THE
          HOUSE in a fiery explosion.INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUSFilled with smoke. The sounds of COUGHING.Dazed, George pushes his way through the smoke, waving his
          arms to clear it. A BLOODY GASH on his forehead.GEORGEMartha? Martha!He finds her lying on the tile floor in what remains of the
          kitchen. Or at least her top half. The rest of her is gone.George slumps to his knees with tear-filled eyes. Takes his
          wife tenderly by the hand for a moment.95.Then the anger returns. He gets up and turns, consumed now by
          a wild fury. Firing with rage over the torn brick wall. He
          CLIPS ANOTHER GUNMAN IN THE HEAD, killing him.George moves back toward the LIVING ROOM, firing as he goes.EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUSRedridge moves between the cars again, staying behind cover.
          George's hail of gunfire has them pinned down.REDRIDGEWe got any more of those RPGs?CARNEGIE GUNMAN #3That was it.REDRIDGEScrew this.Redridge jumps into the driver's seat of the minivan, turns
          the key in the ignition. Jams the accelerator down with the
          butt of his rifle, then shifts the transmission into DRIVE.REDRIDGEGet clear!The gunmen leap clear as the minivan HURTLES TOWARD THE
          HOUSE, engine roaring. CRASHES THROUGH THE CHAIN FENCE.INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUSEli looks up from cover and see the van coming RIGHT AT HIM.
          He dives clear as the van CRASHES THROUGH THE WALL INTO THE
          LIVING ROOM. It SMASHES INTO THE FAR WALL, finally coming to
          a stop.More dust and debris, more coughing. Eli tries to get up, but
          winces in pain. Puts his hand to his side, it comes back WET
          WITH BLOOD. A bad wound. He covers it with his coat, stands
          and moves through the smoke.ELISolara?SOLARA (O.S.)Eli!He finds her in the smoke. She embraces him.ELIAre you all right?96.SOLARAI'm fine.As the smoke clears, Solara sees George PINNED AGAINST THE

          through the smoking hole left by the minivan.Eli reaches for his sword. Met by the sound of MULTIPLE GUNS
          COCKING. Redridge steps out from among the gunmen. Smiles.REDRIDGEGo ahead and try it, holy man. You
                    ain't that fast.EXT. HOUSE - DAYEli and Solara are shoved out of the house at gunpoint and
          marched past the torn perimeter fence to the vehicles.Eli has been stripped of his weapons and backpack. Redridge
          faces him and points a pistol at his head.REDRIDGEWhere's the book?BEAT. Eli doesn't answer. Redridge cocks the pistol.REDRIDGEI ain't playing.Redridge stares him down. Eli just stares right back. Totally
          unflappable. Redridge motions to his men.REDRIDGECheck the pack.The gunman carrying Eli's pack opens it up and tips its
          contents out onto the ground. The ghillie suit, battery, some
          old canned goods, other odds and ends. No sign of the book.CARNEGIE GUNMAN #4It ain't here.97.REDRIDGEIt's gotta be.Redridge holsters his gun and frisks Eli, going through his
          pockets. Finds nothing. He opens Eli's coat and checks the
          inside pockets. Digs around deep inside.REDRIDGEHello, what have we here?And then suddenly he SHRIEKS IN PAIN. Yanks his hand out to
          reveal ELI'S RAT, TEETH SUNK DEEP INTO HIS FLESH.Redridge flails around violently, trying to get the rat off
          him, but it won't let go. His hand is bleeding badly.REDRIDGEFuck! Get it off! Get it off me!He finally manages to shake it free. It hits the floor dazed.
          Redridge STOMPS ON IT with his boot, reducing it to a bloody
          smear in the dirt. Eli lowers his head in sadness.Redridge clutches his bloody hand, glares at Eli furiously.
          Pulls his gun again and marches right up to him, pressing the
          muzzle tight against his forehead.REDRIDGEIf you don't got the book, what
                    fucking use are you?His finger tightens on the trigger.SOLARAWait!She breaks from the gunmen holding her and rushes toward
          Redridge. Reaches inside her dress and PRODUCES THE BIBLE.SOLARAIt's here! I've got it! Please
                    don't kill him.ELISolara...SOLARAIt's just a book, Eli. No book is
                    worth giving up your life for.ELIYou're wrong.98.Satisfied, Redridge takes the book. Runs his hand over the
          leather cover, gazes admiringly at the gold-embossed cross.REDRIDGEYou did good, sweetheart. Your
                    daddy would be proud. He knew you'd
                    come through for him.Solara looks at Eli guiltily. She feels terrible.SOLARAHe said he would hurt my mom. If I
                    didn't help him.REDRIDGE(SMILING)Daddy's little girl...Solara stands between him and Eli. Deadly serious now.SOLARAI want you to let him go.REDRIDGEWhat?SOLARAYou've got what you came for. You
                    don't need him. Let him go.REDRIDGEHe's killed a dozen of my men.SOLARAIf you hurt him, I'm not coming
                    back with you. You'll have to drag
                    me kicking and screaming.Solara glares at Redridge. He sighs. He can tell she means
          it. It's not worth the aggravation. He turns back to Eli.REDRIDGETake your shit and get out of here.Eli gathers up his stuff into his pack. Shoulders it and goes
          to pick up his sword, but Redridge puts his boot on it.REDRIDGENo weapons.Eli still has a half-dozen guns trained on him. He turns and
          walks away, toward the road. As he passes Solara:99.ELII told you we'd both live. Now do
                    you have faith?A tear runs down Solara's cheek as she watches him walk away.Redridge grabs her by the arm and pulls her toward the
          vehicles as his men load up and prepare to move out.IN THE REARMOST VEHICLESolara sits in the back seat, staring out the rear window as
          it drives down the road at the tail end of the convoy.She watches as Eli moves away down the road, getting smaller
          and smaller until he is just a speck on the horizon.She bursts into floods of uncontrollable tears.LATERSolara in the back seat, calmer now. The tears dried on her
          cheeks. She sits staring blankly at the DRIVER in front.And then she LUNGES VIOLENTLY FORWARD. Clawing and biting at
          the driver, who struggles to fight her off. His hands come
          off the wheel and the car FISHTAILS WILDLY.REDRIDGE'S VEHICLEThe DRIVER sees something odd in the rear-view mirror.DRIVERWhat the hell...?Redridge turns to see the car behind VEERING ERRATICALLY then
          SLAMMING ON THE BRAKES, stopping in the middle of the road.REDRIDGEStop, stop!The car screeches to a halt. Redridge watches through the

          wreckage of the besieged house. She runs from the vehicle to
          where ELI'S SWORD lies in the dirt and grabs it up.EXT. ROAD - DUSKSolara races down the road in the car, pedal to the metal.SOLARACome on, come on...Eventually, she sees him. At first just a dot on the horizon.
          But unmistakably Eli. By now, she'd know him anywhere.Suddenly the engine SPLUTTERS. She checks the fuel gauge; the
          needle deep in the red. She pounds the wheel in frustration.SOLARANo... No!The car grinds to a halt, dead. She flings open the door and
          leaps out of the vehicle, rushing after Eli on foot.ON ELI. As always, his pace steady and slow. The sun directly
          ahead of him as it sets on the horizon. Headed always west.Solara is running up behind him, a hundred yards back.SOLARAEli! Eli!He doesn't stop or look back. Just keeps on walking.She finally catches up with him, breathing hard, exhausted.101.SOLARAEli...ELIThought you'd gone back to town.SOLARAI can't go back there. Eli, I'm so
                    sorry.ELIFor what?SOLARAFor what? I betrayed you! I gave

          This kind of compassion is totally foreign to her.She holds out the sword, offering it to Eli by way of
          atonement.SOLARAHere. I thought you might still
                    need this.Eli seems appreciative that she would think to return it to
          him. He takes it and slings it over his shoulder.ELIThank you.SOLARAWhat are you going to do now?ELISame as always. Keep heading west.SOLARAWhy? I mean, you don't have the
                    book any more.102.ELIBut I still have my faith.They walk on together, into the sunset.EXT. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA - MONTAGE - DAYEli and Solara follow the road through burned-out towns and
          retail neighborhoods. Gutted and dead, like every place else.But something is different here. Things are greener. Tufts of
          grass here and there. They attract Solara's attention.SOLARAWhat's that?Eli reaches down and runs his hand through the grass.ELIIt's grass. It used to grow all
                    over the place.SOLARAHow come it's here?ELII don't know. Less poison in the
                    air this near to the ocean, maybe.They keep walking. Eli groans, clutches his side. Does his
          best to hide his pain from Solara. She notices anyway.SOLARAWhat's wrong?ELINothing. Just a cramp.EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHTThey walk on through the night. Eli stops and sniffs the air.SOLARAWhat?ELIDo you smell that?SOLARASmell what?ELISalt in the air. We're close to the
                    ocean. We're almost there.103.EXT. CALIFORNIA ROAD - DAWNThey keep on along the road. A shallow uphill incline. They
          follow it uphill, finally reaching its crest, where they stop
          and take in the view before them.THE PACIFIC OCEAN. Straddled by the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - the
          once-great structure has partially collapsed from decades of
          neglect and disrepair. The span sags and hangs low over the
          ocean, the asphalt cracked and ruptured.On the other side of the bay, SAN FRANCISCO - or the little
          that remains of it. The city has been almost TOTALLY
          DESTROYED - entire areas reduced to rubble, the few buildings
          still standing looking on the verge of collapse.Solara looks at it all in horrified awe. Eli, unperturbed,
          keeps on moving, still clutching his side.ELICome on.EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAYEli and Solara make their way south across the bridge, side-
          stepping the fractures in the road.EXT. SAN FRANCISCO RUINS - DAYEli leads Solara through the rubble of what used to be San
          Francisco. It's like walking through the wreckage of 9/11's
          Ground Zero, but a hundred times the scale. Horrifying.They pass by the wreckage of a HOTEL, nothing but the lobby
          still standing. A HILTON sign protruding from the rubble.Eli uses his sheathed sword as a walking stick, poking around
          ahead of him for loose rubble underfoot. He steps carefully.ELIWatch your footing. Step where I
                    step.EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - FINANCIAL DISTRICT - DAYMore buildings are still standing here, but they're nothing
          more than great dead monoliths. Solara looks up at the
          blasted skyscrapers - she's never seen anything like it.The buildings loom over her like giant tombstones. It scares
          her - like walking through the graveyard of a dead world.SOLARAThis... this is the world before?104.ELIWhat's left of it.They keep walking, passing the TOPPLED TRANSAMERICA PYRAMID.EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - FISHERMAN'S WHARF - DAYOnce a bustling oceanside tourist spot, now a ghost town.Eli and Solara walk along the litter-strewn street, passing
          the old RIPLEY'S BELIEVE-IT-OR-NOT and WAX MUSEUMS. The
          celebrity mannequins are still in fair condition, but slumped
          at their feet are CHARRED HUMAN SKELETONS.Eli is struggling now. He looks pale from the blood loss. His
          breathing labored. Solara takes him by the arm to help him.EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - PIER 39 - DAYA dead, ruined place, like everywhere else. We hear the sound
          of SEAGULLS nearby - the only sign of life at all.Eli and Solara walk along the pier, until they reach its end.
          The original end has long since collapsed into the sea, but a
          RICKETY HAND-MADE ROPE BRIDGE has been affixed to the pier's
          sheared-off edge.Eli and Solara stand at the pier's end, looking out to sea.ELIDo you see that?SOLARAI see it. Is that it?ELIThat's it.Reveal now that the rope-bridge leads out across the bay to:ALCATRAZ ISLANDLooking much the same as it always has, old and dilapidated.
          The coastal fog shrouding it gives it an ethereal look. It
          feels almost like a mythic place - the "promised land" Eli
          has sought for so many years.A tattered STARS AND STRIPES still flutters in the breeze
          atop the prison lighthouse.105.EXT. BAY ROPE BRIDGE - DAYEli and Solara make their way carefully across the bridge. It
          feels highly unstable and sags low over the bay, the waters
          below close enough to lap around their ankles.EXT. ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAYEli and Solara arrive at the prison gates. Securely locked.
          As they inspect it for a possible way to enter:VOICE (O.S.)Who goes there?They look up. A GUARD in paramilitary fatigues is stationed
          in one of the perimeter towers. Training a rifle on them.ALCATRAZ GUARDIdentify yourselves!In the opposite tower ANOTHER GUARD has his rifle trained on
          them too. Eli looks up, raises his hands.ELIMy name is Elijah Stone. I have a
                    message for your boss. I need you
                    to tell him that I have a King
                    James Bible in my possession.BEAT.ALCATRAZ GUARDRemain where you are! Do not
                    attempt to move or you will be
                    fired upon!Keeping the gun trained on them, the tower guard uses his
          free hand to talk into a WALKIE-TALKIE RADIO. We don't hear
          the conversation. All Eli and Solara can do is wait.The guard puts away his radio and shouts back down:ALCATRAZ GUARDBe prepared to surrender any
                    weapons at the gate!BEAT. And then the massive front gates SLOWLY OPEN ON
          MECHANICAL RUNNERS with the low groan of rusted iron.Eli and Solara look at each other, then step gingerly inside.106.INT. ALCATRAZ - MAIN GATES - CONTINUOUSAs soon as they step inside they are SURROUNDED BY DOZENS OF
          HEAVILY-ARMED SOLDIERS. Not U.S. military, more like a semi-
          official militia. But every bit as deadly.Eli and Solara raise their hands. A pair of SOLDIERS take
          Eli's pack and sword, pat them both down for other weapons.SOLDIERThey're clean.The soldiers before them part - to reveal a THIN, BALDING MAN
          wearing spectacles. He wears Kevlar body armor over his tweed
          jacket and tie. Professorial, academic.He approaches, shakes Eli's hand vigorously - very excited.THIN MANWelcome, both of you. I'm Professor

          to a halt outside the theater. Redridge emerges from his car,
          carrying the bible. Walks up to the Palladium and enters.INT. ALCATRAZ - CELL BLOCK - DAYWhat was once a cell block is now an IMMENSE LIBRARY. Stacked
          floor to ceiling with books. Lombardi shows Eli and Solara
          around. Behind them, a pair of ARMED GUARDS follow closely.LOMBARDIYes, we've been doing this for some
                    time now. Collected over thirty
                    thousand volumes from generous
                    donors all across the nation. We
                    even have a printing press that we
                    hope to have operational soon.Solara is stunned as she surveys the endless stacks of books.
          She's never seen anything like it.SOLARAYou turned the whole prison into a
                    library?LOMBARDIWell, not exactly. We're more like
                    a storage facility. We're holding
                    these books here in trust, if you
                    like. When society gets back on its
                    feet and no longer needs us to
                    preserve these volumes, they'll be
                    here waiting.(BEAT)I must ask you, how did you hear
                    about us? We've been doing
                    everything we can to get the word
                    out, but we always like to know
                    where our benefactors come from.ELII was sent here by God.Lombardi raises a quizzical eyebrow.108.LOMBARDIIs that right? Well, it's good to
                    know we're getting such high-
                    profile referrals these days.(BEAT)I must say, I am so excited that we
                    finally have a King James. You
                    know, we have a Talmud here, we
                    have two Korans, we even have that
                    Scientology book. But never a
                    Christian bible, until now. I
                    honestly believed it was the one
                    book I'd never see again, after
                    what happened...BEAT. Lombardi appears sad for a moment.LOMBARDIMay I ask what condition it's in?ELIIt's a little beat-up. But it'll do

                    at it?Lombardi looks at Eli with anticipation. So does Solara,

                    The earth was without form, and
                    void; and darkness was on the face
                    of the deep. And the spirit of God
                    was hovering over the face of the
                    waters. Verse three. And God said,

          smile... but then it fades as Carnegie turns back to her,

          threatening to explode...CARNEGIEGod fucking dammit!He swipes violently at the bible, knocking it out of
          Claudia's hands. He grabs it up and tries to rip it in two,
          but it's too thick to tear. Red-faced with rage, he tosses it
          out over the box balcony. It lands somewhere in the dark
