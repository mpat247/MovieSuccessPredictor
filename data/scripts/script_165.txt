BEING JOHN MALKOVICH A Screenplay by Charlie KaufmanBEING JOHN MALKOVICHA Screenplay by Charlie KaufmanINT. CHEERLESS ROOM - DAYThe room is bare, dusty. A ceiling fan turns. The 
	wall clock ticks. Craig, 30 years old and small, sits at
	a collapsible card table. The only item on the table is a
	book. Craig picks it up, looks at the jacket. It's entitled
	"Sit." Craig opens the book. It reads: "sit sit sit sit
	sit..." over and over, page after page. Craig closes the
	book. He begins to stand, but thinks better of it, sighs.
	He looks at the book again. It is now entitled "Die."  He
	opens it up.  "die die die die die..."  A rooster crows.CUT TO:INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S BEDROOM - MORNINGCraig jolts awake. A rooster stands on Craig's chest,
	crowing. Lotte, also 30, in the middle of dressing for 
	work, hurries in and pulls the bird from Craig's chest.LOTTESorry, hon. I didn't know Orrin

	A small marionette stage stands in the back of the garage.
	The stage is lit and on it is a finely sculpted puppet 
	version of Craig. The "Craig" puppet paces back and forth, 
	wringing its hands with incredible subtlety. We see Craig,
	above and behind the stage. He is manipulating the puppet.
	His fingers move fast and furious. The puppet breaks into
	a dance, a beautiful and intricate balletic piece. Soon the
	puppet is leaping and tumbling through space, moves that one
	would think impossible for a marionette. Sweat appears on
	the real Craig�s brow. His fingers move like lightning. The
	puppet moves faster and faster. Sweat appears on the puppet's
	brow. We see that the sweat is being piped from a special
	device that the real Craig controls. The Craig puppet
	collapses on the floor of the stage. It puts its hands up to
	its face and weeps. Craig hangs the puppet, and comes down
	around the front of the stage. He is heaving. He switches
	off the music, picks up a beer and takes a swig.CUT TO:INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - DAYThe room is filled with penned and unpenned animals of all
	kinds: snakes, lizards, birds, a dog, cats, etc. Craig sits
	on the couch and looks at the want ads, the TV is on in the 
	background. Elijah, the monkey, sits next to Craig holding
	his stomach and moaning weakly. On the TV, Derek Mantini is
	working a 60 foot high marionette from the top of a water tower.
	The assembled crowd is enthralled.TV ANNOUNCERThe crowd is enthralled as Derek
		    Mantini, arguably the greatest

		    Many years ago in the late 1800's,
		    James Mertin, an Irish ship captain

		    Aye. Speak then if ye must.TINY WOMANCaptain Mertin, surely I am a
		    God-fearing Christian woman like
		    yourself, but alas, I am afraid that
		    the world was not built with me in
		    mind. Door knobs are too high, chairs
		    are unwieldy, high-ceilinged rooms
		    mock my stature. Nor am I a marrie
		    lady, Captain. after all, who would
		    marry a person of my diminutiveness?
		    So I am forced to work for my few
		    pennies a week as an optometrist.

		    to work safe and comfortable?

	Mertin wipes a tear from his eye.MERTINWoman, your story moves me like n

		    Pretty good though.

	Malkovich does an amazing triple somersault, lands on one
	knee and, with spread arms, begins singing: "Kiss Today
	Goodbye."  in a beautiful tenor. The orchestra catches up
	with him. The audience goes wild. A pretty-boy young man
	with a big tousle of black hair and a shiny, tight suit
	appears at the back of the house. An usher glances over at
	him.USHEROh, Mr. Mantini! We weren't expecting

	The usher looks nervously around for someone to boot.
	Martini waits in the back. On stage, Malkovich is now
	performing the "back of the car scene" from "On The
	Waterfront."  He alternates between the Marlon Brando part
	and the Rod Steiger part, moving back and forth from one
	stool to the another. He performs it magnificently. We see
	Lester in the audience wiping a small tear from his eye.LESTERNot too shabby.

	Mantini is now sitting in a good aisle seat next to a 
	beautiful woman. Her boyfriend is being hauled toward the
	exit by the usher. The beautiful woman watches, with some
	concern, as the boyfriend is taken away. Then she turns and
	smiles flirtatiously at Mantini. Mantini smiles back. On
	stage Malkovich is dressed in a ringmaster's outfit and
	juggling chainsaws.MANTININothing more than a Goddamn clown.

	and sits down next to her.LOTTEThey're going to take over the

	Malkovich has upPed his convulsions now. He watches Truman

		    Greetings, my lowly subjects.FLORISGreat things, my lonely subtext?MALKOVICH(rolls his eyes)
		    Boy, be careful what you wish for.
			    (to Floris)
		    Never mind, dear. Just enjoy the ride,
		    will you?

	Floris shrugs, picks at her finger nails.MALKOVICH (CONT'D)(to the people on the street)
		    I am bored. You will dance for your
		    king now.

	Without pause the entire street of gray clad people breaks
	into a meticulously choreographed production number. Totally
	silent, totally joyless, but exquisitely executed. We see
	that Maxine is one of the anonymous dancers. Her face is
	void of expression. Malkovich laughs.MALKOVICH (CONT'D)Faster! Faster, my little trained
		    monkeys!

	The crowd dances faster and faster. Older people fall over,
	exhausted, clutching their hearts. Nobody stops dancing to
	help, nobody dares.CUT TO:EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAYBird's eye view of the park. It's all painted gray. Every
	tree, every leaf. There's no sign of life. The camera moves
	in, through some gray trees and gray brush to:A LUSH GREEN OASIS CAMOUFLAGED ON THE TOP AND SIDES WITH GRAY PAINTThis place is filled with life:  Colorful birds, lizards,
	cats, a rooster. All the animals are active, happy, but
	totally silent, as if they know the precariousness of their
	position. Lotte and Elijah sit among them. These are the
	animals that she freed earlier. Lotte and Elijah hold hands
	and look into each other's eyes. We see that they both wear
	gold bands. They are husband and wife. Elijah signs.ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)Must you take this terrible demon
		    on yourself, my love?LOTTEYes. I'm the only one. I have to enter
		    Malkovich and destroy him from the
		    inside. If not me, who?ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)If there was any way I could go in
		    your place. But I'm only a monkey
		    and...LOTTE(puts finger to his lips)
		    Hush, sweetheart.

	Lotte slips into a gray jumpsuit. She stuffs a homemade bomb
	on her pocket. She and Elijah kiss passionately, then
	embrace.LOTTE(to the animals)
		    I'll be with you always, my friends.
		    Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll
		    rejoin you with wings and a beak.ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings
		    and a halo.

	Lotte turns quickly. This is too much to bear. She descends
	into a storm drain. The animals stop what they're doing.PARROT(softly)
		    Good-bye. Good-bye.DISSOLVE TO:EXT. MERTIN-FLEMMER BUILDING - DAYA man-hole cover lifts. Lotte pokes her head out. The coast
	is clear. She emerges. Assumes the dead-eyed expression of
	the others, and enters the building.CUT TO:INT. ELEVATOR - DAYLotte watches the floors change. After seven, she presses
	the emergency stop button. The elevator jerks to a halt.
	She picks up the crow bar in the corner, pries open the
	door. The 7 1/2 floor is gone. Nothing is there but pipes
	and wires and beams. She climbs out onto the floor.CUT TO:INT. BETWEEN FLOORS - CONTINUOUSLotte searched the floor for some sign of the portal. It
	is nowhere to be found. There is a noise behind her. She
	turns with a start. It's Craig, ragged and ill-shaven.LOTTEMy God!CRAIGI'm so glad you're safe. You look
		    really wonderful.LOTTEI'm in love. For the first time.
		    It's funny, but when it happens to
		    you, there's no question.CRAIGHe's a lucky man.
			    (beat)
		    Do I know him?LOTTEIt's Elijah.CRAIGThe iguana?LOTTEThe monkey.CRAIGOh, right. As long as you're happy.
		    I'm sure he's a better lover than I
		    ever was.LOTTEA better friend.CRAIG(beat)
		    I'm sorry for everything.LOTTE(pecking him on the cheek)
		    It's okay, Craig. It all worked out,
		    in an odd sort of way.CRAIGYou came up here looking for the
		    portal?LOTTEYeah. I was going to kill him from
		    the inside.CRAIGAnd yourself too in the process. God,
		    you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I
		    see that before?LOTTEYou saw it once. Now you see it again.
		    That's life, isn't it? And you were
		    up here to try the same thing, weren't
		    you?CRAIGI suppose. But they got here first,
		    the lousy bastards. So now it's all
		    over, I guess.LOTTEI don't know. There's a small
		    community of us. We have a place they
		    don't know about. We're happy. We'll
		    keep trying to figure out a way. Come
		    stay with us. Join the struggle.CRAIGYou'll have me, after all I've done
		    to you?LOTTEPeople make mistakes.CRAIGI'm through with puppets, Lotte.
		    I just want you to know that.LOTTEI know.CRAIGI'd like to be a farmer. I want to
		    help things grow, to encourage life.
		    Do you and your friends need a farmer?LOTTESure. We could really use a farmer.
		    We'd be grateful for the help.
			    (beat)
		    Also, I think, you know, if you
		    wouldn't mind too terribly, a little
		    puppet show every once in a while,
		    would do a lot to lift our spirits.
		    You know, if you wouldn't mind too
		    terribly.

	Craig's eyes well up with tears. Lotte looks at him sweetly.LOTTE (CONT'D)Oh honey. It's gonna be okay.

	She puts her arm around him and leads him toward the
	elevator.CRAIGI love you, Lotte.

	We come on very close to Craig's arm as he lifts it to put
	it around Lotte. We see a thin almost invisible filament.
	We follow it up, and discover that Craig is now a
	marionette being controlled from above by an emotionless
	Mantini in a gray jumpsuit.MANTINI(in Craig's voice)
		    I can't wait to see where you and your
		    friends live, Lotte.LOTTE (O.S.)It's beautiful, Craig, like Eden.

	Now we see filaments attached to Mantini's arms, and w
	follow them up to find that Flemmer is controlling Mantini.FLEMMEROne serpent, coming up.

	Flemmer throws his head back and laughs. The camera moves
	into his mouth and down his throat, which, oddly enough,
	looks exactly like the membranous John Malkovich portal
	tunnel.
