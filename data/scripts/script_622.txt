                                       Marc RoccoApril 15, 2003A pure white screen. Idyllic stillness. All of it looking and
               feeling like the heavens are supposed to.After some seconds of calm, water seems to mist the screen
               and the slight shifts to the left and then the right suggest
               this is a man's P.O.V. Then, suddenly, the white screen is
               tugged and we see it was a sheet covering a presumably dead
               man.WILLIAM STARKS (V.O.)I was 25 years old the first time I
                           died...INT. HOSPITAL, KUWAIT, DAYOne more tug on the sheet and we see, and suddenly hear, from
               William Starks' P.O.V. the CHAOS of the hospital around him
               as DOCTORS and NURSES tend as best as they can to the injured
               soldiers.Our glimpse of STARKS reveals a red stretcher -- soaked in blood --
               and the severe head wound where a bullet's minced his skull.Then, slowly, steadily, a heartbeat is heard over the muffled
               sounds of the hospital and, as his pulse quickens, so does
               the pace of the world around him.INT. HOSPITAL, KUWAIT, DAYWILLIAM STARKS (V.O.)I remember there was so much white
                           everywhere. And I felt peace...even
                           though there was war around me. And I
                           felt alive, even though I knew I was
                           dead.INTERN #1Come on, come on, let's tag these
                           guys and get them out of here.An INTERN, clipboard in hand, stands above STARKS' unmoving
               body with another INTERN (2) beside him. INTERN 1 pulls
               the rest of the SHEET off of STARKS as the OTHER searches for
               his DOG TAGS and gently closes his EYES with her hand.INTERN #2 [Reading from the TAGS]

                           is. William Starks. Born in Vermont.
                           He hasn't got a family listed. The
                           naval hospital'll figure out what to
                           do with him.As the INTERN puts the TAGS back down, she meets STARKS' wide-
               open EYES -- now filled with surfacing tears, sadness, and life.
               She stares at them curiously and, after some seconds, STARKS
               blinks and a TEAR runs down his cheek -- jarring her.INTERN #2 [Calling out]

                           need a doctor! Get a doctor over here
                           now!As the MEDICAL STAFF rush over to STARKS, preparing NEEDLES
               and OXYGEN MASKS, STARKS merely closes his eyes and we follow

               particularly photogenic and affable participant.CAPTAIN MEDLEYThe level of arms on the ground
                           really depends. [Answering a
                           question] But no, I'd have to say we
                           haven't had to engage on the ground
                           as heavily as we might have expected.NEWSANCHORHave you lost any men today, Captain?CAPTAIN MEDLEYNo. One of my Corporals took a bullet
                           to the head, but it looks like he
                           might make it. Looks that way...FLASHBACK TO:3.EXT. IRAQI VILLAGE, DAYWe see only the HAND, and not the man to whom it belongs,
               enter the frame and pull the TRIGGER on a gun. The sound
               pierces the air, and the bullet hits the side of STARKS' head
               in a FLASH, shaving the skin around it right off.EXT. AMERICAN NAVAL HOSPITAL, DAYSTARKS convalesces in a navy hospital bed -- his head heavily
               BANDAGED and his arms suited with I.V.'s and dressings -- as a
               MAJOR, a LIEUTENANT and a DOCTOR stand above him.STARKS' face -- now cleaned of the blood that masked it before --
               is alert, and striking. Even with the bandages, he remains
               well-built and strong, like a shot straight to the head would
               have been the only way for an enemy to take him down.DOCTORSergeant Starks was very lucky. A
                           little more to the right and it
                           wouldn't have wanted to come out...MAJORBut he's never gonna be able to
                           remember what happened?DOCTORIt's hard to say. Sergeant Starks
                           could have retrograde amnesia
                           or... [lowering his voice] any form of
                           psychological suppression. It's very
                           common with traumas like this.STARKS [Cutting him off]
                           Sergeant Starks is in the room,
                           [beat] and I want to know when I'm
                           going home.When he speaks, STARKS maintains the sharp, steady gaze of a
               man assured of himself, even if he is lost among his
               surroundings.LIEUTENANTSergeant, you have no surviving
                           family in the States. I'm sure you
                           have friends or distant relatives,
                           but unfortunately we have no record
                           of them yet.MAJORCaptain Medley has recommended you
                           for the Purple Heart, Sergeant.4.STARKS lets the tribute roll right off him. He spots the
               CIGARETTES in the Lieutenant's pocket.STARKSCan I have one of those?LIEUTENANTOf course.The LIEUTENANT lights one for him.DOCTORThere is help for you, Sergeant.LIEUTENANTOf course there is.
               Their VOICES start to fade as STARKS smokes his cigarette,
               blowing the SMOKE upwards and following it with his eyes.
               He's finished with these men and everything they stand for.STARKS [V.O.]I didn't know where my home was. I
                            just knew I didn't want to be there
                            anymore.EXT. HIGHWAY, RURAL VERMONT, WINTER, DAYSTARKS -- recovered now -- walks by himself along a long
               highway. He seems to be walking away from things even if he
               can't remember what they are yet.EXT. HIGHWAY, RURAL VERMONT, WINTER, DAYJEAN PRICE (30s) -- a hippie who happens to be a mother -- and
               her daughter, JACKIE (8) tremble in the cold next to their
               stalled car. JEAN sits next to the car, holding her knees to
               her chest, more like a child than her daughter.JACKIE runs her little gloved hand over her mom's ski-hatted
               head as she cautiously watches STARKS approach them. He cuts
               an arresting figure against the empty landscape.JACKIECome on, mom. Don't fall asleep...STARKSYou two ok?JACKIEOur car won't start.5.STARKS [Looking at JEAN]
                           What's your mom's name?JACKIE [Cautiously]
                           Jean.STARKS takes off his backpack and kneels down.STARKSJean? Jean, can you hear me? I need
                           you to try to wake up, Jean.JEAN opens her eyes, stone red.STARKSYour mom take anything before this
                           happened?JACKIEYeah, but I don't know what.STARKS[Beat] What's your name?JACKIEJackie.JACKIE decidedly sticks out her gloved hand. STARKS smiles
               and briefly shakes it. STARKS rubs a hand over his chin and
               cheek as he thinks of what to do.STARKSNice to meet you, Jackie. Why don't
                           you wrap this scarf around yourself
                           and try to keep your mom awake while
                           I take a look at your car.EXT. HIGHWAY, RURAL VERMONT, WINTER, DAYAs Starks works on their engine, JACKIE anxiously watches her
               mother throw up in the distance. STARKS sees her watching and
               tries to distract her.STARKSWhat do you think of all this snow?JACKIE looks at him curiously.JACKIE[Beat] Nothing.STARKS looks at her and smiles at her honest answer; Jackie
               turns her head back towards her mother.6.JACKIEBut I like it I guess.STARKSHey, can you reach the gas pedal?JACKIEYeah.JACKIE gets behind the wheel, crouching down in the seat just
               enough so her foot reaches the pedal.STARKSGo ahead, turn it on. Keep pushing
                           it.JACKIE revs up the engine and, a few coughs and sputters
               later, the car settles into a nice, working hum.JACKIE [Smiling]
                           It works!JACKIE steps down. She looks like she could hug Starks and,
               unexpectedly, decides to. As STARKS awkwardly returns it, he
               sees JEAN lifting her eyes to see him holding her daughter.JEANGet your fucking hands off my
                           daughter!JACKIEMom, he just fixed our car.JEANJackie, get in the car. NOW!JEAN reaches for a RIFLE in the back of the truck but
               stumbles from the nausea before she can pick it up.JEANLook, I don't want any trouble, so...STARKSNeither do I, ma'am. I'll be on my
                           way.JACKIEMom, you've got it wrong...STARKS motions for JACKIE to stop as he collects his bags.JACKIEYou're just gonna walk?7.STARKSYeah, I'll hitch a ride or something.

                              remember who you are.JACKIE [Still looking at them]
                              Hm.STARKS unties them and gives them to her. She reads them.STARKSI think I can remember what's on

               about him and a confused look on his face as a MENACING VOICE
               questions him.VOICE (O.S.)"Jackie" and "Jean" are the only
                              ...things you know for certain about
                              that day?STARKS nods.8.VOICE (O.S.)Are you aware we have no last name,
                           no place of residence, and no record
                           of any physical presence for these
                           "friends" of yours? How's that
                           possible in this day and age?STARKS nods as a muffled "Objection" flickers away in the
               background...VOICE (O.S.)I may need to actually hear that
                           answer, Mr. Starks.STARKS[Beat] Yes.
               With Starks' answer, the background of the courtroom is
               suddenly illuminated and we see that THIS IS STARKS' OWN
               TRIAL. The VOICE belongs to a satisfied PROSECUTION who turns
               to face a medium-sized CROWD watching on...INT. COURTROOM, SMALL TOWN VERMONTThere are three KEY WITNESSES called to the stand: CAPTAIN
               MEDLEY, Starks' commanding officer in the Persian Gulf; DR.
               HALE, a psychiatrist; and OFFICER NASH, the cop who first
               came upon the crime scene. Their three testimonies are
               intercut to present the case against Starks quickly and
               confusingly -- just like it appears to himself.OFFICER NASH [Emotional]
                           Eddie [correcting himself], Officer
                           Harrison, was lying in a pool of his
                           own blood -- on his back.DR. HALEWilliam Starks could be blocking the
                           incident. It would explain his well-
                           systematized scheme about the little
                           girl and her mother. A delusion as
                           complex as that can often replace the
                           reality of an incident like this.OFFICER NASH [Cont'd]
                           Officer Harrison'd been shot three
                           times. He was long dead by the time
                           we got there.9.DR. HALEI have heard of Gulf War Syndrome.
                           The medical community is only
                           beginning to gather information about
                           it.PROSECUTIONGulf War   Syndrome? What the...Why
                           don't we   start diagnosing Hard Life
                           Syndrome   while we're at it? I've
                           gotten a   lot of convictions we could
                           overturn   with that logic...CAPTAIN MEDLEYSergeant Starks was awarded the
                           Purple Heart. That award doesn't
                           applaud violence or murder. [Beat] It
                           applauds honor.DR. HALE [Cont'd]
                           His subconscious is blocking it, the
                           same way it began to in the Gulf,
                           particularly as something similarly
                           traumatizing happened to him then.The following summations are punctuated by the BLACK FADES
               between them and the simulated BLACK around them as they
               speak -- like STARKS, at the beginning of his own testimony.PROSECUTION [Disdainfully]
                           It's not a question of whether or not
                           he was sane when he did it?! He
                           absolutely was. Three bullets in one
                           man are three moral failings in
                           another.CAPTAIN MEDLEY [Incensed]

               hospital meeting. These doctors deal in the currency of
               madness every day and wear the heaviness of that burden on
               their faces.CHIEF OF STAFFI'd certainly say he should be
                           considered violent, just given his
                           case...DR. BECKERHow'd he dodge a conviction?CHIEF OF STAFFHis defense argued post-traumatic
                           stress and delusional disorder. He
                           evidently couldn't account for a
                           similar incident during his service
                           in Desert Storm.DR. BECKER[Beat] So why isn't he just in the

                           had another one testify for him. Who

                           mind taking him?BECKER shrugs a nod as the Chief moves on to the next order
               of business...INT. STARKS' ROOM, WARD, ALPINE GROVE, DAYSTARKS is shown to his room by NURSE HARDING -- stern, senior --
               and her henchman, DAMON -- a BURLY ORDERLY who relishes his
               command, however diluted it may be.DAMON unceremoniously puts Starks' UNIFORM on the bed. He and
               NURSE HARDING wait at the door for Starks to change into it.12.DAMON looks at STARKS -- his eyes inadvertently conceding that
               Starks is more threatening than the common senile he
               marshals; STARKS stares him back -- deliberately conceding
               that he's right.STARKS turns around -- only then looking stunned in the
               sterile, cotton-white room, wondering where his life
               disappeared to.INT. DR. BECKER'S OFFICE, ALPINE GROVE, DAYSTARKS sits opposite DR. BECKER in a harsh, tiled office.

                           Lucky me.BECKER looks at Starks -- his eyes casting shame upon the
               alleged murderer that sits before him.BECKER [Stupefied]
                           You shot a man three times: first in
                           his heart, then in his stomach and
                           then...point blank, in the back of

               notices he has a limp.FADE TO:INT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, DAYFrom STARKS' P.O.V., we follow him walk down the hospital

               blur into one another and, on either side of him is a crazy
               world with crazy patients who've lost their way in it.STARKS reaches for the WALL and runs his HAND over it, trying
               to keep his balance. He's walking towards BECKER who stands
               at the end of the hall, talking to other PATIENTS.STARKS [Softly]
                           I don't belong here. I don't...STARKS falters but stays up. He turns to see a shell of an
               OLD MAN looking right through him with wooden eyes. STARKS'
               eyes stay so completely fixed on the old man's haunting sight
               that he doesn't see what's ahead of him.14.He bumps right into a HYSTERICAL PATIENT whose sudden,
               earsplitting SCREAMS peal interminably through the air.STARKS [Mumbling]
                           I'm sorry. I didn't mean... I'm
                           sorry. I didn't mean it.STARKS' fumbled efforts to help the PATIENT only feed his
               hysteria more. The SCREAMING is intolerable.STARKS [Forced to yell]
                           Will you listen to me? I'm not going
                           to hurt you. Please. I didn't mean
                           to bump...I'm sorry.ORDERLIES and NURSES, followed by DR. BECKER, surround them
               now, violently pulling STARKS off the patient. BECKER,
               familiar with the PATIENT (HAROLD), tries to calm him.BECKERIt's ok, Harold. It's ok.STARKS searches their blurred faces and stops on Becker's as
               they restrain him and give him more drugs.STARKS [To Becker]
                           I don't belong here...BECKER [Angrily, to the ORDERLIES]

               disquieting FOOTSTEPS in the hall, coming closer and
               closer...What follows happens too quickly for STARKS to react.DR. GRIES, NURSE HARDING AND DAMON -- enter Starks' room.
               They close the door and deftly administer a TRANQUILIZER and
               a GAG.STARKS has no idea what's happening to him as they drag him
               out, and his STIFLED CRIES ensure no one else does either.NURSE HARDINGCome on, army boy. Time for some
                            therapy.15.INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, LATE NIGHTThe first face STARKS sees as the world comes into focus is
               NURSE HARDING'S. Around it loom those of DR. BECKER, DR.
               GRIES and DAMON.A shot of the room shows a constraint-ridden apparatus
               hanging sternly on the wall. It is THE JACKET: an apparatus
               designed to encase a man's body. Made of coarse, sickly-
               stained red ands brown canvas and velcro restraints that would
               first chafe, then forever burn, the skin they're wrapped
               around, the JACKET looks medieval. Its appearance suggests
               its purpose: to slowly STRANGLE THE LIFE OUT OF A MAN.STARKS has been stripped of his blue uniform and is lying
               nearly naked on a burial slab in the cold of the basement.
               Even under the tranquilizers, STARKS formidably resists them
               as the ORDERLIES wrestle to strap him in. Then Starks,
               sensing as anyone would, that something bad is being done to
               him, wisely stops resisting long enough to petition them.STARKSWait. Wait a minute... Please.BECKER motions for them to stop with his hand. STARKS blinks,
               trying to bring the faces above him into focus...STARKSI, I don't belong here.BECKER looks into Starks' eyes. Sanity stares back.BECKERNo. I don't think you do either.
                           [Beat] But neither of us can do
                           anything about that.
               BECKER barely nods and STARKS is trussed in the JACKET with
               METAL CLAMPS. BECKER writes some details down, presumably
               about Starks' treatment.A CADAVER DRAWER -- just barely deep enough for a body or tall
               enough for the height of a nose -- is slid open and STARKS,
               already dreadfully sheathed in the JACKET, is crammed inside.The ORDERLIES slam the cadaver drawer into the wall.INT. CADAVER DRAWERSTARKS is literally entombed alive. Silence. Stolen breath.
               They bolt the drawer and the CLANG echoes through his body.
               The BLACKNESS and CLOSENESS of the space choke him as his
               heart beats the frantic rhythm of his struggle.16.We see only the WHITES of a pair of petrified EYES on a man
               who's losing it -- hyperventilating, suffocating... for all
               intents and purposes, dying the worst kind of a death.Combing the walls for any sign of an explanation of what's
               happening to him, STARKS sees a single white DOT -- almost
               like a fleck of dust -- flitting between undecided SHAPES in
               the blackness until, slowly, it grows bigger and bigger...INT. JACKET/TUNNEL PASSAGEIt's now a PATTERN of WHITE DOTS that changes the more STARKS
               stares at it. Beneath it seems to be a smaller pattern with
               formless shapes and figures that STARKS tries to discern
               before they change into something else. Only after STARKS
               blinks does he start to see the WHITE of the DOTS is SNOW
               from a picture that is slowly and terribly coming together in
               the following glimpses, each hardly longer than the time
               between BLINKS.1) A little river of RED marring the snow around it,
                spilling from...2) OFFICER HARRISON'S mouth just seconds before his last
                breath. His eyes close and STARKS sees and hears a FLASH...3) From the barrel of a GUN fired near him.BLOOD sprays STARKS' hands as he looks down at them and
               realizes he's in the scene and not just watching it. He looks
               up from his hands and sees in similar flashes...1) The snow beneath the BLOOD changing to DIRT as STARKS
                stares at it. This time, the little river of RED comes
                from...2) The BODIES of IRAQI villagers, all still except one...3) That of a IRAQI WOMAN. She unflinchingly lays her
                hand in the entrails of a CORPSE and smears its
                blood on her face just before she lies back down among
                the dead, content to be one of them.The only SOUNDS during these dreadful images have been a
               trapped man's anxious BREATHS and the BEATS of a HEART
               pumping so fast it could be a drum...The screen goes BLACK and QUIVERS as STARKS clenches his eyes

               turns her head towards the ENTRANCE and, as she looks there,
               so does Starks. That is when he first lays eyes on a woman, a
               WAITRESS -- worn but still lovely -- leaving the diner. He is
               taken with her and, for the first time since he's been in the

                           I'm fine.DR. LORENSONMr. MacKenzie, do you think I could
                           talk to Mr. Starks privately?MACKENZIEOf course you can, Doc. William, it
                           was an absolute pleasure. Thanks for
                           playing.Just before he walks away, MACKENZIE turns around nervously
               and uncharacteristically looks STARKS right in the eye.21.MACKENZIEHey...when they talk you out to the
                           woods tonight and invite the wolves,

                           eat you when there's music playing.STARKS looks at MacKenzie briskly, wondering if his words
               were directed or just the meandering of a nut. But MacKenzie
               just nods his farewell and starts humming as he walks away --
               dead arm in tow.DR. LORENSONSo you're ok?STARKS [Still distracted]
                           What?DR. LORENSONI asked you if you're ok.STARKS [Suspiciously]
                           I don't know. You tell me, Doc. You
                           think there's anything wrong with me?DR. LORENSONI don't know. You're not my patient.STARKS looks away. Lorenson gives him a once over.DR. LORENSONYou look like you've lost some
                           weight. Are you eating?STARKSI am. One of the few things I
                           remember doing is eating. So I guess
                           I must be exercising it off in my
                           dreams.STARKS looks at LORENSON, seeing if he'll respond. LORENSON
               looks back curiously at STARKS' pointed stare.STARKSYou done with your small talk?DR. LORENSONSure.STARKSGood.STARKS walks away slowly and WEAKLY -- a fact that doesn't
               escape LORENSON's observation.22.INT. MEN'S ROOM, ALPINE GROVE HOSPITAL, DAYSTARKS walks into the bathroom, keenly eyeing the thin slit
               of WINDOWS at the top of the wall. He walks closer to them,
               when he suddenly hears some STRAINED BREATHING from inside
               one of the stalls. He checks the first stall, pushing it
               open. It swings both ways since it doesn't have a lock.The sound continues. STARKS walks slowly past the second
               stall to the third and then... WHACK! The door swings all the
               way towards STARKS. BRUTALLY. He falls backwards -- his head
               just barely missing a fatal confrontation with the sink.DAMON, the ORDERLY, walks out.DAMONI'm sorry, Starks. Must have not seen
                           you coming there.STARKS writhes in PAIN -- straining for his own breath now.DAMON [Leaning down close to him]
                           Were you worried about me? [Smiling]
                           That's so sweet. Thanks.With that, DAMON walks out, leaving STARKS on the floor.INT. STARKS' ROOM, ALPINE GROVE, NIGHT, CHRISTMAS EVESTARKS sits in his room, listening to the silence of the
               night interrupted by first faint, then approaching,
               FOOTSTEPS. Closer and closer...then harmfully near until
               DAMON and HARDING enter his room.They pause -- awaiting a reaction. STARKS doesn't give them
               one.NURSE HARDINGYou gonna get the fuck up?INT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, NIGHT, CHRISTMAS EVESTARKS walks stoically down the cold corridors to his own
               torture -- flanked by HARDING and DAMON on either side.INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, CHRISTMAS EVEThey're all in the room. STARKS seems pretty calm. Only in a
               C.U. do we see his eyes register the JACKET...BECKERI'm glad to see you're cooperating
                           this time, Mr. Starks.23.STARKS looks at the WIDE, STURDY restraints on it. They would
               really hurt if you hit someone as hard as you could with
               them. They might even knock someone out...DAMON and HARDING move to undress him, when STARKS makes a
               move to do it himself. They look to DR. BECKER who NODS that
               it's all right.DAMON begrudgingly lets go of Starks but not before he steps
               on one of Starks' bare feet.STARKS doesn't flinch. He merely turns away from them and
               bends down to take off his pants. On his way up, he GRABS THE
               JACKET OFF ITS HOOK and, using it like a weapon, aims to
               smack it across Damon's face. DAMON deftly ducks and the
               JACKET hits BECKER instead. The force of the blow sends
               Becker down, and as he falls against the wall, DAMON and
               HARDING leap to restrain Starks.BECKER   opens and closes his eyes, trying to get them into
               focus.   His right cheek is cut pretty bad. DR. GRIES helps
               BECKER   to his feet and picks his BROKEN GLASSES up off the
               floor.   BECKER puts them on.DR. GRIESHold him while I get the
                             tranquilizer.DAMONFuck the tranquilizer! I got a foot.DAMON KICKS Starks hard in the back, nearly sending him down.BECKERNo. That's not necessary.BECKER looks down and sees his own BLOOD fall on the floor.
               He looks up at STARKS who, even in his pain, looks shocked at
               the force he just used.BECKERLet him go. [More firmly] I said, let
                             him go!As soon as they let him go, STARKS lunges for BECKER --
               pushing him up against the wall. STARKS stops, presumably
               about to harm Becker but unsure, even to himself, of what
               he's capable of doing...BECKER looks fearlessly into Starks' eyes.24.BECKER [An inch away from his face]
                            What, Starks? What are you going to
                            do? End me just because I'm an
                            inconvenience to you? [Beat] Just
                            like you did with Officer Harrison?STARKS' face registers the meaning in Becker's words and a
               look of self-doubt crosses his face.BECKERThe only thing your mind is missing
                           is a conscience.STARKS lets go of him and, as soon as he does, DAMON and
               HARDING restrain him. BECKER calmly wipes the BLOOD from his
               face, looks at his hand, shakes his head and walks out.DR. GRIESWait...Dr. Becker, how long do you
                           want us to leave him in for?BECKER doesn't answer. He doesn't even turn around. DR. GRIES
               goes after him.DR. GRIESJust strap him in for now.And DAMON and HARDING start to...INT. BECKER'S OFFICE, ALPINE GROVE, CHRISTMAS EVE, SOME TIMELATERBECKER turns around from the window and we see that his cheek
               is BANDAGED. He opens a drawer, takes out some SCOTCH and
               pours himself a SHOT. He swallows some pills with it.After he drinks it, he looks up to see GRIES standing
               opposite him, watching.DR. GRIESYou ok?BECKERI'm fine.DR. GRIES[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother

               documentation of the action -- the ruin -- as it's occurring.As STARKS blinks, TEARS fall and he hears, over it all, a
               counseling voice...MACKENZIE (O.S.)When they take you out to the woods

               They move like they're liquid and, when they settle, the
               whole wall is replaced with one large IMAGE of a BEAUTIFUL
               WOMAN -- a waitress -- standing at the counter of a COFFEE
               SHOP, moving a STRAND OF HAIR out of her face with her hand.STARKS blinks slowly -- struck by this dream of her. He reaches
               out and closes his PALM around her like he might catch hold
               of the moment with this simple gesture.The whole WALL OF IMAGES twinkles marvelously, as we...CUT TO:28.EXT. DINER, SMALL TOWN, VERMONT, CHRISTMAS EVEThe WAITRESS (early 20s) -- tired, with kind eyes, soft skin

               emerges from the diner. Even with no effort, she is
               remarkably pretty.From her UNIFORM, we know that her day was spent there.
               STARKS simply stares at this WOMAN who seems markedly removed
               from the world around her. The only fact she wears on her is
               that she's tired.She spots STARKS and can't help but do a double-take. Both
               are momentarily taken with each other, though she tries to
               hide any indication that she is.INT. WAITRESS' CARShe gets in her old car and starts it. As it warms up, she
               looks for STARKS in her REARVIEW MIRROR and sees he's still

               again at STARKS in her REARVIEW MIRROR. He has hardly any
               winter gear on him -- no gloves, no hat, no coat -- just jeans
               and a flannel. He looks lost among his surroundings, as much
               because he doesn't know where he is as because he doesn't
               look like he belongs there.She reverses towards him.WAITRESSIn case you hadn't figured, it's

                           normal or simple this time either.She looks over at him -- momentarily suspicious. He looks back
               innocuously; there's something innately safe about him.31.WAITRESSAt least you're honest. That's some
                           kind of start.STARKS sees her take another DRINK from the flask. She pulls

                           am I going to do with you?STARKSNothing. [Getting up] Thanks for
                           bringing me this far.WAITRESSWhere are you going? You'll freeze
                           out there. You don't even have a

                           there and then I'll have to feel
                           guilty. And I've already got more
                           guilt than I know what to do with.
                           [Beat] Do you want something to
                           drink?STARKSNo, I'm ok.She leaves to the KITCHEN to fix herself a drink and STARKS
               stares after her. Suddenly, a SMASHING SOUND is heard as
               something falls in the kitchen. STARKS' whole BODY TENSES UP
               as he wonders whether he's being taken out of the Jacket.WAITRESSShit! That was one of my good
                           glasses!33.As she presumably cleans it up, we stay on STARKS who slowly
               gains hold of himself. She comes back, DRINK in hand and
               pushes the STRAND OF HAIR in her face back the same way she
               did when he saw her in the tunnel. Even through her
               weariness, she looks radiant under the Christmas lights. She
               takes a long SIP.WAITRESS [Noticing he's shaken]

                           normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her
                           own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and
                           I have a couch.And sadly, no plans for the evening anyway. She looks back --
               her EYES even more tired from the liquor.STARKSI'm not gonna hurt you.WAITRESS [Softly]
                           I know. [Clearing her throat] I'm
                           gonna go take a bath. Make yourself
                           at home. You know, fix yourself
                           something to eat if you're hungry or
                           anything. There's nothing to steal,
                           but don't be a jerk and take
                           something anyway. And don't snoop,
                           ok?STARKSOk. [Beat] My name's William by the

                           but I don't want to know you. Honest.STARKS nods as she walks out.EXT. YARD BEHIND WAITRESS' APARTMENT, EVENINGSTARKS, still without a coat, collects some WOOD...34.INT. KITCHEN, WAITRESS' APARTMENT, EVENINGSTARKS looks in her fridge. There's not much to work with --
               just some JARS and plenty of VODKA.INT. LIVING ROOM, WAITRESS' APARTMENT, SOME TIME LATERSTARKS has lit a FIRE and set out a feeble dinner for them
               when the WAITRESS comes out of the bedroom in sweats.WAITRESSWhat's this?STARKSThe best I could do with what was in
                           your fridge.
               She looks and sees a SANDWICH on a BUN in one plate and a
               SANDWICH on two different colors of TOAST on the other.Then she looks over at the fire; it's obvious from the way
               she looks at it that it's been years, if ever, since
               someone's done something like this for her.STARKSI only lit it because it was so cold
                           in here. I'm sorry if...WAITRESSNo, it's fine. [Beat, swallow]

               her lips.WAITRESSWell, good for you.STARKS[Beat] Why?36.WAITRESS[Beat] Real is overrated.STARKS smiles back uncertainly.STARKSYou don't think that's crazy?WAITRESSMaybe. [Beat] Maybe not.She holds up her glass somewhat sadly.WAITRESSSometimes I don't know the difference

                           [Finishes her drink] You want another
                           one?She goes to the KITCHEN, and STARKS clears their PLATES.INT. LIVING ROOM, WAITRESS' APARTMENTSTARKS goes in the KITCHEN as she comes out with their
               drinks. He hears her turn on the RADIO. She lands on an
               OLDIES station that's playing "Girl of North Country" by Bob
               Dylan.INT. KITCHEN, WAITRESS' APARTMENT, NIGHTSTARKS smiles a little, then realizes he remembers, and
               likes, the song. It's the first familiar thing for him in
               days.He walks out slowly to the living room, where the WAITRESS
               sits on the couch, drinking. STARKS moves closer to the
               radio, leaning into it, listening and forgetting, for a short
               while -- only as long as a piece of song -- everything else.BOB DYLANIf you go when the snow flakes storm

                           To keep her from the howlin' winds...STARKS listens close -- smiling a small, sad smile. Over the
               HARMONICA, we pull back and see two very lonely people
               passing time together the way people sometimes need to be
               able to.37.STARKSThis is a great song.WAITRESSYou remember it?STARKS [Nodding slowly]
                            It's like I feel like...I know who I
                            am. I just can't remember anything
                            that made me this person.When STARKS looks at her then, he's so close to a meltdown
               that it takes him a moment to fight his way out of it.STARKSBut hey, who can forget those words?

                           to remember?WAITRESSMay be easy to remember, but not easy
                           to get. Being warm, maybe -- but,

                           was seventeen. That's when my father
                           died and, before that, it was
                           apparently just me and him since I
                           was born 'cause my mom split.WAITRESSSo you never knew your mother?STARKSI guess not. But, as of now, I never
                           knew either.38.WAITRESSI'm sorry.STARKSYeah. [Beat] How about you?WAITRESSNever knew my father. I grew up with

                           friends... She was this woman who had
                           so much life in her, she had to find
                           ways to kill some of it just to be
                           like the rest of us. [Beat] She died

               been listening so closely.WAITRESS [Exhausted]
                           Yeah, that's when I stopped being a
                           nurse. I never thought I could stop

                           can't take care of other people.She closes her eyes and finally passes out. STARKS watches
               her face, lit serenely by the FIRE and the Christmas lights.
               It bears her grief even in sleep.39.He covers her with a BLANKET then looks around and spots the
               only PERSONAL EFFECTS in the room on her mantle. He walks
               towards them, tripping slightly on a CORD from the LIGHTS. He
               stumbles but regains his balance by reaching for the wall.As he pulls himself up, he spots what is only inches away
               from where his hand landed on the wall: HIS OWN DOG TAGS,
               given to Jackie, only a couple weeks ago, hanging from a
               single NAIL tacked into the wall.Stunned, he stares at his NAME and BIRTH DATE scored on the
               metal. He looks back at the WAITRESS and then to the few
               PICTURES on the mantle: they are of JACKIE and her mother,
               JEAN. STARKS runs his hand through his hair, trying to
               swallow the improbability, and inexplicability, of the
               situation.
               STARKS' EYES search the room for ANYTHING that could help him
               figure out what's happening. On the console is an OLD PAPER
               and some MAIL. Totally disoriented, STARKS nearly STUMBLES on
               his way to the PILE.The label on the first BILL reads "Jackie Price." On the
               second, the same. And the third...until at the bottom of the
               pile, STARKS spots an OLD NEWSPAPER with the answer on its
               DATE: December 3, 2004.STARKS is absolutely stunned.
               STARKS looks over at JACKIE and, just then, the HARSH SOUND
               of the DRAWER being opened rings deafeningly in his ears and
               the image of her starts to DISSOLVE at this worst moment. He
               is being taken out of the JACKET...INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, LATE NIGHTIt's DR. GRIES, racked with guilt, who pulls Starks out...He winces at the sight of the BLOOD and SWEAT streaked across

               does to us, faint and distant. DR. GRIES drips some WATER in
               Starks' mouth. As some of it trickles out, it runs into the
               JACKET, burning STARKS' chafed skin.STARKS' EYES flutter and DR. GRIES pushes the drawer back in,

                           Alpine Grove. That's the mental
                           hospital. How do you know that?JACKIEI looked it up.STARKSHow?Then he remembers -- understanding with a chill that what she
               is saying could entirely be true.STARKSI gave you my dog tags.JACKIENo, you didn't. They found William
                           Starks' body dead in the snow.STARKSHow'd he die?JACKIEI don't know. But he did die.
               STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through
               her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the
               apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table,
               lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then
               laughs nervously as she looks up.JACKIEI know what this is...I picked you up
                           when I was drunk and you probably
                           thought I'm just fucked up enough to
                           fall for this. But the thing is I
                           know what I'm doing when I drink. I
                           just usually don't care. Right now, I
                           do though. And I want you out. Now.44.STARKSIt's December 25th, 1993 today.JACKIENo, it's not. [Beat] It's December

                           That can't be. That's...just, I
                           mean... You're telling me I died in
                           less than a week in the time I'm in.JACKIEI'm telling you I don't care what
                           time you think you're in. You're not
                           William Starks. [Beat] I don't
                           believe in many things, but I believe
                           in death. And it doesn't give back
                           what it takes. So whoever you are...I
                           did a nice thing, you've made me
                           regret it enough already, so please,
                           just leave.STARKSI'll leave. But look at me. Look at
                           my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met
                           you and your mother. I told you then
                           that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There
                           was no one for miles around so I know
                           you know there's no way I could have
                           known that from a pair of dog tags
                           you had lying around.JACKIEPlease...STARKS looks at her tenderly before he turns to leave.
               JACKIE, a little calmer, looks at the door like he's still on
               the other side of it and calls out softly, and sadly...JACKIEHappy Birthday.INT. JACKET/TUNNEL PASSAGESTARKS looks around him and, we see, from bottom up, the
               exterior around Jackie's house melt away as STARKS suddenly
               faces the massacred village in Iraq. Shocked at what's
               happening to his body, he looks up, petrified. His body is
               wound as tightly as a knot.45.EXT. IRAQI VILLAGE, NIGHT, 1991Again, we're glimpsing the scene through PHOSPHORESCENT GREEN
               NIGHT VISION intermittently negotiated with real-time images.Opposite Starks stands a CRAZED IRAQI SOLDIER -- seething in
               anger and pointing his gun at a LITTLE BOY, presumably
               belonging to the MAN not five feet away. Next to Starks is an
               angry CAPTAIN MEDLEY, ordering STARKS to follow him. STARKS
               is watching himself in the scene.MEDLEYYou walk on. They pick up their guns
                           and fire at you, you stay. They pick
                           up and fire at each other, and you
                           walk on!STARKSHe's got his gun pointed at a kid.MEDLEYThat is not our problem.STARKSYeah, well, none of this is our
                           fuckin' problem.STARKS turns and aims his gun at a CRAZED IRAQI SOLDIER
               threatening to shoot a child. We hear him YELLING in Arabic.What STARKS doesn't see is another IRAQI SOLDIER (2) aiming
               his GUN at STARKS.MEDLEYWe are leaving this site right now.STARKS doesn't hear him; he's busy perfecting his aim.STARKS [To the first Iraqi soldier]
                            Hey!At the force of the word, the SOLDIER lowers his gun and the
               LITTLE BOY flees.STARKS, who is now in the scene himself, lowers his gun
               slightly as he approaches the SOLDIER. Neither speaks the
               other's language but they're both saying everything with
               their eyes. Neither moves his off the other.Just then, though, we see the SECOND IRAQI SOLDIER get a
               clear aim at STARKS.46.He takes his SHOT before anyone else does. STARKS goes down
               as the skin off the side of his head is shaved off.He falls to the ground. As the rest of the picture fades to
               black, all that is left is previously mysterious, still
               haunting PAIR of EYES that we now see belonged to theCRAZED IRAQI SOLDIER.And over it all is the now more distant CLANK OF METAL as the

                           expected some common sense on your
                           part and clearly I was expecting too
                           much. [Beat] Just open the drawer.DR. GRIESWe never should have done this to
                           him...BECKERWell, what are we gonna do about it now?Nothing is Gries' answer. Still, Becker seems to share the
               concern.BECKER motions for them to open the drawer. They pull him
               out. STARKS looks cold and wrecked.DR. GRIESIs he? [Impatiently] Is he dead?BECKER feels for a pulse and seems surprised to find one.47.BECKERNo. [To Harding and Damon] Get him

                           His behavior's hardly suggested he
                           needed neuroleptics.48.BECKERAnd you know that from what, a couple
                           two-minute stares across a room?LORENSON [Firmly]
                           He didn't need anti-psychotics, if
                           that's even all you're giving him...?BECKER ignores Lorenson's insinuation and merely turns his
               CHEEK all the way round towards Lorenson so he can see the
               BANDAGE from the CUT Starks gave him.BECKER [Steadily]
                            After he slashed me with a hospital
                            instrument, I determined, in my
                            professional opinion, that Mr.
                            Starks, needed a little placating.LORENSON[Beat] You sure he wasn't provoked?BECKERYou sure you want to begin making
                           that kind of insinuation? [Beat] I
                           took five stitches during a routine

                           Our patients are sick.BECKERYes, they are.LORENSON looks at BECKER; he knows he's hiding something.LORENSONHe's not gonna end up like Casey,
                           Tom. Whatever happened to him is not
                           going to "happen" to Starks. I don't
                           know what you're trying to do here
                           ...but he's not a lab animal, Tom.

                            you? Just because you failed your
                            patient doesn't necessarily mean the
                            rest of us did, too. [Beat] Sorry to

               beliefs.BECKERNow, if you'll excuse me, it's

               snaps his neck in its direction -- fearful of everything at
               this point. When he looks, there's nothing there; he's not
               sure there ever was. The room starts to blue as he looks

                           convinced he was sick. So he came
                           here.BECKER leans into Starks' view to make sure he's listening.
               STARKS is.54.BECKERThen one day a little girl came with
                           her mother to visit a relative and I
                           caught Ted stealing looks at her --
                           the kind you really have to steal if
                           you know what I mean. [Beat] I asked
                           Ted then if he could remember what
                           the little girl who he had... slain
                           ...was wearing. [Beat] He gave me a
                           look I'll never forget, and, when he
                           answered, it wasn't with a color or
                           any sort of physical description I'd
                           expect. "Oh yes," he said. "I remember
                           it. I remember it well." [Beat] Those
                           were actually his last words I think.BECKER's expression bears a hunting mixture of anger and
               remorse as he recounts Ted's tale.STARKSWe are not birds of a feather.BECKERMaybe not. [Beat] But I do think
                           you're in a tree... woofing like a
                           dog. And I'm just trying to help you
                           the only way I can think of.BECKER gets up and, as he moves out of the light, STARKS sees
               his BANDAGED CHEEK, reinforcing his memory of what
               happened...STARKS [Provokingly]
                           What happened to your cheek, Dr.
                           Becker?BECKERI was careless. Happens sometimes.FADE TO:INT. STARKS' ROOM, RECOVERY WARD, ALPINE GROVE, DAY, 1992STARKS looks out on the SNOW-COVERED GROUNDS from his room on
               the third floor. He seems pacified for the moment.INT. HALLWAY, RECOVERY WARD, ALPINE GROVE, DAYEverything about the dingy hospital punctuates the sad
               mechanics of managing madness. CATATONIC PATIENTS and dated
               equipment litter the hall and, as we follow a NURSE who walks
               among them, we spot STARKS -- ARMS suspended in air and GLAZED
               EYES fixed on the ceiling -- pretending to be one of them.55.His ARMS fall and he wipes his dried MOUTH as soon as she
               passes. STARKS has successfully made it out of his room. She
               turns one corner as STARKS hustles to turn another...INT. DAY ROOM, ALPINE GROVESTARKS is almost   there. As RANDOM ORDERLIES pass him, STARKS
               lets his posture   collapse as he despondently hangs his head
               down so low they   can't see his face. They pass, and STARKS
               starts scuttling   towards the door to the outside.As soon as he reaches it and is outside in the cold -- with
               only his BLUE PATIENT UNIFORM -- Starks walks normally, like
               he no longer remembers the risks. Instead he remembers what
               Jackie told him.JACKIE [O.S.]They found William Starks' body dead
                           in the snow.STARKS [O.S.]How'd he die?JACKIE [O.S.]I don't know. But he did die.EXT. GROUNDS, ALPINE GROVESTARKS leans down -- seemingly oblivious to the cold -- and
               lifts some snow to his mouth, TASTING it like a man who needs
               to affirm he is still alive. He's so rapt that LORENSON's
               VOICE takes him by surprise.LORENSONHey. You're not supposed to be out
                           here.
               STARKS stiffens as he realizes he could be in the place where
               his body was found. The terrible question asks itself on his
               face: Is this when Starks is killed?STARKS [Turning around sharply]
                           What are you going to do to me?LORENSONWell...As LORENSON reaches into his POCKET for something, STARKS
               anxiously holds his breath. It's BLACK when it comes out and...
               a SKI HAT when it opens up. STARKS lets out his breath,

                           I thought I'd just ask you to come
                           back inside with me.STARKSAnd if I didn't want to come?LORENSONI guess I'd ask you why.STARKSBecause I don't think I'm crazy.LORENSONYou're not crazy.STARKS is surprised by Lorenson's agreement.LORENSONYou suffer from delusional disorder.
                           That doesn't mean you're... crazy. It
                           just means you're confused. And

                           because that was determined to have

               is looking at a desperate man who is persuasively, and
               cogently, staring back at him.57.LORENSON[Beat] William, I'd like to ask you
                           something if I can.STARKSSince when do people around here have

                           Dr. Becker?STARKS still doesn't know how much Lorenson knows, and if he
               should trust him.STARKSFine. [Beat] Why made you ask?LORENSON answers first with his eyes looking over Starks'
               body. STARKS merely stares back tersely.LORENSON [Carefully]
                            I just hope you'd let me know if that
                            wasn't the case.STARKSWhy, what would you do?LORENSONI could try to...make it stop.STARKSNo. I don't want it to.LORENSONSo it's helping?

                           different person.LORENSON -- sensing she's not going to get any more from
               Starks -- turns around to go back inside. It's only as she
               turns her face away from STARKS that we see how nervous she
               is. But you'd never guess it from her tone...LORENSON [Casually]
                            You comin'?STARKS looks towards the FENCES locking him in from every
               direction. LORENSON waits until she hears STARKS' FOOTSTEPS
               following her. She waits until STARKS has reached her.58.LORENSONYou should be careful. You could be
                            killed if they found you out here.STARKSBelieve me, I know.INT. PATIENT CAFETERIA, WARD, ALPINE GROVE, 1992STARKS and MACKENZIE are eating opposite each other.STARKSWhat were you talking about the other
                            day?MACKENZIEI wasn't talking about anything.STARKSYeah, you were. What you said about
                            them taking me out to the woods...MACKENZIE clams up slightly at the mention of it...STARKSWhat do you know about the Jacket?MACKENZIE's eyes start to twitch nervously.MACKENZIEI know you need one when it's really

               of it.MACKENZIEOh no, you're pretty young. Your

                           of it than you think...STARKSNo. [Beat] I mean I found out while I
                           was in it that my body's gonna be
                           found in four days.Just then, NURSE HARDING is upon them. She carries a ROD in
               her hand which she TAPS menacingly on the floor as she walks
               towards them.HARDINGWhat are you two yappin' about?STARKS tenses up as he sees only the ROD, which could inflict
               a GASH if hit across a man's head the right way. Nearly every
               object could be a threat to his life as this point.MACKENZIE [Spoken like a nut]
                           [Beat] We're talking about our
                           ability to go forward in time, to go
                           into the future. [To Starks] That is
                           what we're talking about here, right?STARKS is startled MacKenzie gets it.STARKSYeah, it is.HARDINGYou know something? You're two

                           fuck up and eat your food.HARDING walks away with a final stare that Starks returns.STARKS [Under his breath]
                           I gotta get back in it, MacKenzie.60.MACKENZIEIt's gonna be sticky.STARKSWhy?MACKENZIE's body betrays his discomfort talking about it in
               its sudden jerks accompanying every word.MACKENZIE'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it
                           now. When she started getting
                           suspicious about me was when they
                           stopped using it on me. Women!STARKSSo what am I supposed to do?MACKENZIEYou could still always give Becker an
                           itch. 'Course you might get killed

                           this annual review and just cut our
                           budget. Our silence on the matter
                           should be enough to appease the civic
                           conscience without wasting an hour we
                           don't have.DR. GRIESMaybe it's not such a waste.LORENSON looks at GRIES askance before she sets the record
               straight.LORENSONIt's the ticking of a box on a sheet
                           of paper no one cares about.61.DR. GRIESThey don't care about all the things
                           we do right. [Beat] But they might

                           should come here to look for.LORENSON can see GRIES is trying to tell her something.LORENSONWhat should they be looking for?DR. GRIESThey should just be looking harder.LORENSON grabs GRIES' arm, sensing the import of her words.LORENSONWhere? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it?
                           He's doing stuff, isn't he?DR. GRIESLater. I'll tell you about it later.
                           We got a session to catch now.INT. WARD 3, ALPINE GROVE, 1992, DAYSTARKS is in a different ward with PATIENTS who appear more
               threatening and disturbed. As he is anxiously looking around --
               presumably for a way out -- Starks hears one of the PATIENTS
               humming an eerily DISCORDANT MELODY. Looking to see who it
               comes from, STARKS happens to spot ONE PATIENT -- a young,
               fierce-looking guy -- eyeing a YOUNG NURSE, SALLY,
               administering medication from a dated CART.STARKS looks around the room and notes there are NO DOCTORS
               or ORDERLIES around. The YOUNG NURSE, meanwhile, is focused
               on the medicine -- oblivious to the BRUTE eyeing her.The BRUTE's not that far away when he starts walking towards
               the YOUNG NURSE. STARKS starts in their direction, picking up
               speed -- maneuvering through VARIOUS INCOHERENT PATIENTS -- as
               the BRUTE reaches the NURSE.He throws her TRAY down and pushes her against the WALL. She
               starts screaming as he pushes up against her. STARKS picks up
               the TRAY and strikes the BRUTE across the head with it.The BRUTE holds his head in pain as he tries to regain his
               balance. It's clear he's impaired. But it's also clear he
               understands pain.62.STARKS [To Sally]
                            You ok?As she NODS, her EYES dart above to the HAND about to strike
               him. Off her look, he ducks and turns around, punching the
               BRUTE in the stomach -- HARD -- but not before the piece of GLASS
               he held from one of the broken MEDICINE BOTTLES comes
               perilously close to STARKS' head.The BRUTE bowls over and STARKS looks at the GLASS terrified.
               Is this when he dies?The BRUTE -- incensed more than ever -- lunges at him a final time.
               STARKS gets him by the NECK, expertly applying PRESSURE
               POINTS and, after only a few seconds, subdues him. STARKS
               himself seems surprised that he knew how to use them. He lets
               out a suspended BREATH, instinctively touching his FOREHEAD
               to make sure he's not cut. He looks back at SALLY.SALLYAre you ok?STARKSYeah, Why are you in this ward alone?
                           Where is everyone?SALLY [Defensively]
                           There's a state rep visiting so
                           they've moved everyone around. But
                           I've been alone before...STARKSWhere are the other orderlies?SALLYIn the therapy session downstairs.
                           That's what the rep's sitting in
                           on...STARKSOk, listen. I want you to get out of
                           here and lock the door behind you.
                           I'll go get some doctors.SALLY looks at STARKS, wondering whether she can trust him.
               Her eyes shift to the BRUTE on the floor and she remembers
               that she can.63.INT. MAIN ROOM, WARD, ALPINE GROVE, DAY, 1992The STATE REP -- 40s, disgruntled, even drowsy -- is
               recognizable among a group that includes the CHIEF OF STAFF
               (Dr. Williams), BECKER, LORENSON and GRIES. They are
               presiding over a GROUP THERAPY SESSION when STARKS enters...STARKS [Calling out]
                            Sorry I'm late, Dr. Becker.BECKER is noticeably taken aback but tempers his response.BECKERMr. Starks, this session is for our
                            civil patients. Damon, please take
                            Mr. Starks back to his ward.
               STARKS cuts him off and threatens with his gaze.STARKS [Derisively]
                            No. Please, Dr. Becker. You can strap
                            me in a Jacket or even gag me, but
                            please don't leave me out of therapy.
                            This is where I feel like I make the
                            most progress.BECKER relents, seeing STARKS has the upper hand -- an
               AUDIENCE, deranged but eager no less.BECKERFine, Mr. Starks. You can pull up a
                            chair for yourself.As STARKS walks across the room, it's obvious to everyone -- as
               they turn their heads to watch him -- that he is a physically
               ailing man. Using all his strength, he walks up slowly to the
               group, dragging a CHAIR behind him because he doesn't have
               the strength to lift it. STARKS sits down.BECKERMr. Jensen, please continue.JENSEN -- a twitchy schizophrenic -- surveys the group
               seriously, determining whether it's safe to say what he's
               about to...JENSENWell, [beat] I've been approached by
                            the Federal Trade Organization.BECKER's not listening to a word JENSEN says. But STARKS is.64.BECKER [Calm as ever]
                           And what have they approached you

               about.STARKSWhat case?LORENSONI was working with a boy named
                           Eugene.STARKS shows no recognition but JACKIE does.JACKIEWho was Eugene?LORENSON [Peaked]
                           He was a friend's son. [Beat] Are you
                           familiar with the case?75.JACKIEJust a little, when we were looking
                           up information about William's
                           father. How did he help?LORENSONIt's complicated, but [looking at
                           Starks] in a way, your father let me
                           know how I'd get through to him.JACKIEHow?LORENSONHe just said...that I'd shock Eugene
                           and then things would change for him.JACKIEI don't understand.LORENSONI still don't either, even after all
                           these years.STARKSDo you know how my father died?LORENSON [Unconvincingly]
                           I don't know how much I remember but
                           I seem to think it was from a... cut or
                           blow of some sort or another.STARKSHow'd he get it?LORENSON[Beat] I don't know.STARKSBut Dr. Morgan said you were around
                           when my father was...LORENSONI was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a
                           lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know
                           more about your father's. [Sincerely]
                           I didn't know about everything that
                           went on here.LORENSON says it like she's hiding something.76.STARKSWell, do you think Dr. Becker would
                           have any idea?LORENSONHow do you know about Dr. Becker?STARKSMy dad wrote some things down before
                           he died.LORENSON looks like she's suddenly remembering something.LORENSONThat's right. He did.STARKS looks at Lorenson curiously; he doesn't know what
               Lorenson is talking about.LORENSONSo maybe Dr. Becker would know.
                           [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the
                           statute of limitations has run out
                           for charging the hospital with any
                           liabilities.STARKSWhy would we do that?STARKS just stares at LORENSON, not knowing if he died by
               this man's hands or not, not knowing who he can trust...JACKIEBecause Becker resigned after the
                           charges brought against him by State
                           Patient Advocacy Groups.LORENSONI see you've done your homework.
                           [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot
                           of changes since then. At the time,
                           we didn't have the...resources to
                           help our patients the way we needed
                           to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are
                           different.STARKSI wouldn't be so sure. Like you said
                           about back then, you might not know
                           everything going on around here.DR. LORENSON looks right at STARKS.77.LORENSONIt's important for you to know who
                           your father was, isn't it?STARKS[Beat] Yeah, it is.LORENSON [Eerily]
                           It's almost as if your life depended
                           on it. Isn't it?STARKSExactly.LORENSONWell... [beat] let me know how your
                           search turns out.STARKS[Beat] We will.INT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, DAYSTARKS and JACKIE walk briskly down it, away from Lorenson's
               office.STARKSI don't believe a thing she just
                           said.JACKIEMe neither. Who was the boy she was
                           talking about, Eugene?STARKSI have no idea.JACKIEYou think Lorenson kills you?STARKSMaybe. I don't know. Seems more
                           likely Becker does, but at the very
                           least she knows how I died.JACKIELet's see if they have an address for
                           Becker. I also want to figure out
                           more about the kid you helped her
                           with.STARKSWhy?78.JACKIEBecause that's the part I believe is
                              true. You probably did help her
                              somehow with the boy and Eugene's
                              name did come up over and over again
                              on the abstracts I pulled.STARKS nods.STARKS[Beat] There's one more thing I want
                              to see.INT. CORRIDOR [LEADING TO BASEMENT], ALPINE GROVE, 2004STARKS, determined, now leads JACKIE. As they reach the end
               of the hall, we see DAMON -- now in his 50s -- look after them
               curiously before he goes back to his work with a PATIENT.INT. BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, 2004JACKIE watches STARKS ignore the "Authorized Personnel Only"
               SIGN as he pushes the door open without so much as a pause.INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, 2004The morgue looks exactly as before.STARKS is momentarily jarred in the room. He looks to the
               wall on which the JACKET hung and sees only the BARE HOOKS
               that used to hold it up.STARKSThis was the room. They used to hang
                              the Jacket there. [Turning to Jackie]
                              This is where it happened. This is
                              the room I'm actually in right now.JACKIE isn't doubtful, but it's also hard to be
               convinced...STARKSI can show you. It's probably in
                              there.STARKS walks to the CADAVER DRAWERS and rests his hands on
               the one they put him in. Then, with great difficulty --
               physical and emotional -- he opens it to see if there is
               anything left.He pulls it out, and there's nothing in there.79.JACKIEMaybe this wasn't such a good idea...STARKS leans closer, locating all the proof he needs: the
               stained metal -- still reddened and browned with DRIED BLOOD --
               and the part of the morgue slab he CLAWED his NAILS into when
               he was in it. JACKIE looks at it in disbelief.STARKSYes, it was. [Softly] My fingers were
                           the only things I could move. [Beat]
                           Dead bodies don't bleed. And they
                           certainly can't claw so hard they
                           dent metal.INT. HALLWAY, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVESTARKS and JACKIE are leaving the MORGUE, when STARKS spots
               DAMON, now hardly a hair of the bully he was before. DAMON
               stares at him curiously; STARKS glares back furiously.DAMONYou folks ain't supposed to be down
                           here.JACKIEWe were just leaving.DAMON doesn't take his eyes off Starks.DAMONDo I know you from somewhere?STARKSYou may have known my father, William
                           Starks.
               DAMON smiles, remembering...DAMONThat's right! Goddamn, you're the
                           spitting image. I didn't know he had
                           a son.STARKSHe didn't either.DAMON [With a dirty laugh]
                           I'll be damned. He musta been 12 when
                           he had you. [Beat] You could be his
                           ghost.80.STARKSDid you know my father?DAMONOh yeah, sure. He killed a cop,
                           right?STARKS looms strangely over DAMON in this exchange.STARKSYou wouldn't happen to know how he
                           died, would you?DAMON [Slightly apprehensive]
                           No, I don't. I just remember them
                           finding his body.STARKSYou don't know any more, Damon?DAMON [Shocked]
                           How'd you know my name?STARKSMy father used to talk about you.DAMONOh yeah, what'd he say?Damon's eyes betray his unease.STARKSHe said you were a sadistic fuck that
                           belonged in jail.DAMON is shocked, and cowed. So much that he shakes as he
               looks for his bearings.DAMONLook here, I don't like you getting
                           in my face and saying this bullshit
                           to me...STARKSThat's too bad.DAMONI thought you said you never knew
                           your father.STARKSI didn't. [Beat] Did you have
                           anything to do with his death?81.DAMONI don't know what you're talking
                           about, man. I swear. This is some
                           weird shit you're telling me... and I
                           don't know how come you're doing it.STARKS starts to see a shaking man who stands confused and
               distraught before him.STARKSHe died because he bled to death from
                           a blow to his head. Someone had to
                           have given him it.DAMONI never touched your father! I swear!
               Damon's eyes are filled with dishonesty, tears and a craven
               FEAR. STARKS leans in closer to DAMON as he remembers...STARKSYou know something, Damon? You're
                           like a mule. You're real stubborn.
                           But there's ways of fixin' that. All
                           you need is a good stick. [Beat]
                           Here's your stick. Live with it.STARKS looks like he could easily bash Damon's head against
               the wall, but instead he lets it go and walks away.EXT. CEMETERY, ALPINE GROVE GROUNDS, 2004, DAYSTARKS is standing above his own headstone: WILLIAM STARKS,

                           now. I looked him up and he was

                           told them what happened to you over
                           there. His testimony...that coward

                              house for two months and nearly
                              starved himself to death before he
                              was brought here. All because his

               falls out of his arm. LORENSON makes a move to adjust it and
               STARKS flinches perceptibly, startling LORENSON.STARKS [Adjusting it himself]
                            Maybe that just makes him weak, not
                            crazy. Or maybe he is crazy. [Beat]

                           And, judging by the fact that you
                           just told me about another patient,

                           something to stop it.LORENSONAnd how do you know that?STARKSBecause of the future. I know what's
                           going to happen.LORENSONWilliam, that is just another facet
                           of my delusions.Then, STARKS remembers the only thing that might help him. He

                           delusions?LORENSON -- having prepared to continue -- is bowled over at
               the mention of her patient. She loses all color and calm in
               her features.LORENSONHow do you know about Eugene?STARKSYou told me about him. I saw you and
                           I think you thought I knew something
                           about him. So you told me.LORENSON doesn't know what to say.LORENSON [Somewhat angrily]
                           How do you know about Eugene!?89.STARKS [Shaking his head in disbelief]
                           You told me. It's like two parts of
                           you talking through me. Look, judging
                           from your reaction, there's no other
                           way I could know about him.LORENSONThere obviously is, so what don't you
                           just tell me how you found out about

                           I'm saying is true.LORENSONI don't know how you know about
                           Eugene, but these ideas are part of

               of his debilitating vehemence.INT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, DAY, 1992MACKENZIE sits idly on one of the hallway benches until the

               unscrupulousness of a criminal so convincingly it bears
               little resemblance to his usual demeanor.STARKSMakes it a little easier for me to

                           really, what was the point? Torture?
                           I think that's still sort of illegal
                           in some states -- though we'll have to
                           check on Vermont. And, how's this for
                           the cherry on top: it seems my
                           physician is a pill-popping freak.

                           makes some pretty good copy for a lot

                           down when I say it, don't you think?It takes BECKER some seconds to swallow this.BECKERI think...I have to think about it.BECKER cocks his head to one side as he does. Then he slowly
               makes his way over to STARKS and leans in closer to him.
               STARKS instinctively raises his hand to his HEAD -- prepared
               to be defensive if he has to be. If this is the moment when
               he's killed.But BECKER only YANKS the I.V. angrily out of Starks' arm,

               see a head of GREY HAIR. He slowly turns around, casting a

               Though it's aged slightly, it hasn't softened.EXT. CHURCH, SHELBOURNE, 2004JACKIE and STARKS watch as the people file out of Church.
               They are leaning against her car when STARKS spots him.DR. BECKER walks beside a SMALL CHILD -- presumably his
               GRANDSON. JACKIE registers his formidableness with some
               surprise; Becker's maintained a strong physique and is hardly
               a shade less intimidating than he was before. Only his hand
               has a permanent shake now.STARKS doesn't waste any time. He heads straight for him.
               Almost sensing him, BECKER looks in his direction. The casual
               look on his face is instantly supplanted by one of DISBELIEF.STARKSYou still go to Church. How's that

               unaware of the haunted history being made between them.BECKERWho are you?STARKSI think you know. Your eyes say you

                           came out.STARKSHow?BECKERBecause...because you came out and
                           said something you couldn't have
                           possibly have known. You came back
                           and repeated three names...BECKER falters as he recalls his offenses.BECKEROf people like you. People I was just
                           trying to help. They couldn't get
                           worse so I thought, with medication,

                           patients. You were criminals that
                           ended up at Alpine Grove.STARKSNo, we were patients.BECKER concedes after all this time.BECKERYou and the others didn't seem that
                           way then.104.STARKS is quiet as he comes to understand how it's about to
               work out: if Becker tells him those names now, he essentially
               indicts himself.STARKSWho were the others?BECKER remembers with a hint of remorse.BECKER [Racked with remorse]
                           Nathan Piechowski, Jackson

               hit him, too.BECKERHow did you come to know their
                           names?STARKSYou just told me. The last time I

                           didn't make history like you wanted
                           to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out
                           different, didn't it?BECKERI didn't put you in Alpine Grove.STARKSNo. [Beat] You put me on drugs and
                           then you put me in the Jacket.105.BECKER [Stoically]

                           you did. Just because you had keys
                           to a cage didn't mean you had
                           animals inside. [Beat] You've
                           earned your guilt, Becker.STARKS shares a last look with Becker before he walks away

               started to flutter, starts driving. In the distance, the

                            You come back to me...STARKS nods, then goes in and closes the door behind him.
               JACKIE stares after him -- alone in the total silence of the
               room. She listens for the slightest noise and that's when she
               actually hears the sound of the DRAWER being opened for
               herself.She realizes he's gone. She RUSHES after him, opens the door
               in a fit, and then, sees what she feared most: no sign of
               Starks. JACKIE falls to her knees, right there, on the
               bathroom floor and cries out like a woman only beginning to
               realize how unfathomably deep her heart is...INT. ALPINE GROVE, 2004STARKS is suddenly in the waiting area outside Lorenson's
               office -- still severely weakened.He walks slowly to the OFFICE DOOR and feebly knocks.
               LORENSON answers and STARKS falls into her arms.LORENSON [Stunned]

               STARKS can barely talk. He spews as much of it as he can out
               in his feverish state...111.STARKSI'm William Starks. I'm not his son.

                           happened.STARKSI did?LORENSONYeah.STARKS clutches his side in pain as they prepare to take him
               out.STARKSWho...who kills me?LORENSONYou have nothing to fear, William.But when we look to see STARKS' reaction, he's not there...INT. BECKER'S OFFICE, ALPINE GROVE, EVENINGBECKER is dressed to leave the hospital when he suddenly
               decides not to. He takes off his coat and his gloves, but not
               his SCARF, and walks out of his office with a decided
               urgency.INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, 1992BECKER pulls STARKS out of the drawer and looks down ruefully
               at STARKS' scathed face. STARKS, drenched in BLOOD and SWEAT,
               seeks the outline of Becker's face in the light.STARKS [Whispering]
                           Becker, I know about you. [Beat] I
                           know what you did to your patients.112.BECKER looses the straps around Starks' neck to help him

                           didn't cure them. You killed them.BECKER momentarily loses color and his forever cool mien.
               After some seconds, STARKS passes out and BECKER -- hands
               trembling -- looks as though he might stick him back in when,
               instead, he starts to remove him from the Jacket himself. He
               silently and carefully unties each of the straps -- taking
               unusual care for Starks' flesh as he prepares to put him on a
               stretcher.INT. STARKS' ROOM, ICU, ALPINE GROVE, EARLY MORNINGAs the SUN starts to rise, we see STARKS -- now cleaned up --
               recovering in his bed. He is unconscious. From his window, we
               look down and see Dr. Lorenson's car pulling into the lot...FADE TO:INT. STARKS' ROOM, ICU, ALPINE GROVE, EARLY MORNINGLORENSON, still wearing her winter gear, walks into Starks'
               room, anxiously checking his VITALS. Her anxious expression
               reveals Starks' frailty. She looks to the window then and
               sees an empty chair with only Becker's SCARF on it.LORENSON goes to the window in time to see BECKER getting
               into his car.INT. STARKS' ROOM, ICU WARD, ALPINE GROVE, LATER THAT MORNINGSTARKS lies unconscious in the bed. The NURSE, SALLY, stops
               by the room to check on Dr. Lorenson.SALLYWould you like anything, Dr.

               up.LORENSONYou're going to be ok, William. We
                           just need to get your fever down

                            I'm starting to think I'm really
                            gonna die soon. So I'd like to write
                            some things down.LORENSONI'm not gonna let that happen.STARKSYou still don't believe me, do you?LORENSONI do believe you...STARKSNo. Listen to me...the kid, Eugene...LORENSON still gets taken aback by Starks' knowledge of
               Eugene.STARKSNo one knows you're working with him
                           so how would I have found out? He's
                           your friend's son, right?114.It's true; no one could have known about Lorenson's private
               life. STARKS coughs, clearly in great pain.LORENSONWilliam, I can't indulge these
                           delusions, even when you're in this
                           state.STARKSListen to me. That's all I ask.LORENSON has no choice.STARKSHe's having absence [pronounced
                           "absance"] seizures when he stares
                           off into space like he does. He has
                           them so often that that's why he
                           hasn't learned to speak properly.LORENSONWho told you this?STARKSYou did, in the future. You figured
                           it out because a part of you already
                           knows this. That's how it works.
                           [Beat] I'm just telling you something
                           you already know, even if you haven't
                           realized it.STARKS closes his eyes, gathering what strength he can.STARKSI don't know when it'll happen but
                           soon I think, you'll shock the boy
                           and it'll wake him up.LORENSONWhat are you talking about?STARKSYou'll figure it out and you'll do
                           good by him.That's all STARKS can manage before LORENSON sees he's about
               to pass out again.CUT TO:INT. LORENSON'S APARTMENT, NIGHT, 1992115.LORENSON answers the KNOCK at her door. It's EUGENE andTALIA.LORENSONHey.TALIAWhat is it?LORENSON [Finding it hard to explain]
                            Nothing. [Beat] I don't know. I
                            thought of something I could try.LORENSON looks at TALIA helplessly. TALIA nods and leads
               Eugene inside. LORENSON can't help but look down the hall to
               make sure no one's there.INT. STUDY/OFFICE, LORENSON'S APARTMENT, NIGHT, 1992LORENSON sits across from EUGENE, holding up a picture of a
               DOG. Between them is a tray of MILK and COOKIES.LORENSONCome on Eugene, try to say it with
                           me. This is a "DOG".EUGENED--d---d----.But Eugene can't hold the sound of the letter long enough to
               make the word. An absence seizure takes hold of him as he
               looks out unconsciously into space.LORENSON moves closer to him.LORENSON [Softly]
                            What's happening to you?LORENSON checks Eugene's pulse and leans in close to the
               boy's unconscious face like the answer is there if she just
               looks hard enough.LORENSONAre you having a seizure? Is that
                           really what's going on?LORENSON spots a corner of Eugene's EYE twitching slightly,
               and, rushing to get a better look, takes the shade off of the
               nearby LAMP and holds it above his head so she can get a
               better look at him.116.Just then, TALIA opens the door, startling Lorenson. She
               knocks over the MILK and, as it spills on the LAMP CORD -- now
               on Eugene's lap -- it causes an ELECTRIC SHOCK. Eugene catches
               it. TALIA gasps and Lorenson watches the boy in fear.The moment passes and Eugene -- more responsive than he has
               ever been before -- looks at his mother and Lorenson. He
               doesn't know what's happened but he is aware, and awake,
               like never before.EUGENE picks right up where he and Lorenson left off.EUGENEDog. [To Talia] Hi.TALIA and LORENSON look at him and each other at shock.

                           then things will change for him.LORENSONYou ok, Eugene?EUGENE holds Lorenson's gaze steadily for a few moments.LORENSON [Stunned himself]
                            Yeah, you are ok.TALIAWhat's happening?LORENSON [Putting the pieces together]
                           He got a little shock. [To himself]
                           And it's reset him. Not permanently
                           probably...but at least for a little
                           while. They use it on epileptic
                           patients sometimes...TALIABut he's not epileptic.LORENSONNo, but he is having seizures.TALIA looks at LORENSON. She's still confused. LORENSON's

               see Dr. Lorenson in the doorway. STARKS still looks weak but
               much better than before.117.STARKSIt worked, didn't it?LORENSON nods.STARKSThis is really happening, isn't it?DR. LORENSON[Beat] What do you need me to do?STARKS[Beat] Thank you.STARKS folds the LETTER.STARKSI need to get this letter to

                           little far out there, but easy
                           enough.STARKSGood.Bob Dylan plays on the RADIO. STARKS smiles as he hears him
               and turns the music up; the act is sad because, as LORENSON
               notices, it belongs to someone with an interest to live.EXT. JACKIE AND JEAN'S HOUSE, DAY, 1992DR. LORENSON and STARKS drive up to Jean and Jackie's house.LORENSONYou want me to come with you?STARKSNo, I'll be ok.STARKS slowly makes his way to their front door and knocks on
               it as best as he can. The sound, however, is still
               understandably soft.STARKS waits and then reaches for the knob on the door. He
               opens it and looks inside. We first see his face, and the
               devastation on it, as we guess the sight he's laid eyes on.JACKIE is sitting at the kitchen table, still only 7 years
               old. Though STARKS expected it, he falters under the
               disappointment of seeing a girl he liked instead of the woman
               he loved. As she looks up at him, it's all he can do not to
               break down.STARKSHi.JACKIE [Surprised]
                           Hey. [Beat] I remember you.STARKSI remember you, too.STARKS shakes his head, looking at her. She looks beautiful,
               and still hopeful. Her life lays ahead of her and her fate --
               when he found her in 2004 -- remains as distant as possible
               from this innocent, still promising image.STARKSJackie, how have you been?119.JACKIE smiles; she doesn't get asked that often.JACKIEI've been ok.STARKSGood. How's your mom?JACKIEOk, I guess.STARKS nods. JACKIE smiles. It's all he can do not to
               crumble.STARKSDo you think I could see her?
               She looks at him and senses, like kids do, the desperation in
               his eyes.JACKIESure.JACKIE calls out for Jean, then runs up the stairs to get
               her. LORENSON has gotten out of the car and is waiting
               outside on the porch. STARKS remains in the doorway.Some seconds later, JEAN appears -- gaunt but in a slightly
               better state than we saw her before.JEANCan I help you?STARKSHey, Jean. Nice to see you.JEAN looks a little confused.JEANI'm sorry? Your face looks awfully
                           familiar, I just can't quite place
                           it...JACKIEMom, this is the guy that drove us
                           home that afternoon we were stuck
                           on the highway. The guy you yelled
                           at for no good reason...JEANOh, yeah.120.She gives him a once over, and, seeing how weakened he looks,
               decides intuitively he can't be much harm. She also notices
               LORENSON waiting by the car.JEANThere something you need?STARKSYou could say that.STARKS looks at JACKIE, hesitating because of her. Sensing
               this, JEAN asks Jackie to leave.JEANJackie, go play in the snow.JACKIEWhy?JEANJust do it.JACKIE leaves and walks to the yard. STARKS watches.STARKSI can't stay long. [Motioning to
                            Lorenson] That's my doctor and I
                            gotta get back to the hospital.

                            much of it as you can.STARKS hands her the LETTER.STARKSI won't be around when you read
                           it...but I hope you believe it.
                           It'd be a real shame if you didn't.JEAN looks baffled but, seeming to grasp his urgency, nods.STARKS[Beat] I should be on my way.JACKIE has been watching this exchange from the shed. When he
               looks over there, he catches her eye and CALLS OUT, with what
               strength he has left...STARKSBye, Jackie.121.These are the hardest words STARKS has probably ever had to
               say. JACKIE just stares after him, as does JEAN, as he shows
               himself out.STARKSHappy New Year to both of you.JEANThanks. You, too.EXT. JACKIE AND JEAN'S HOUSE, DAY, 1992As STARKS is walking away, we see his eyes begin to tear in
               the cold -- but not from it.INT. JACKIE AND JEAN'S HOUSE, DAY, 1992JACKIE abruptly runs after him.JACKIEHey, wait!STARKS stops in his tracks; he clears as much sadness from
               his face as he can before he turns around to face her.STARKS[Beat] You be good to yourself,
                            Jackie.JACKIEOk.Then, suddenly, she sticks her hand for him to shake, as she
               did that day on the roadside; only now, it trembles slightly
               in the cold.STARKS takes JACKIE'S HAND and holds it in his own softly and
               affectionately. JEAN and DR. LORENSON look on curiously as
               STARKS looks in her face, at her hand in his, and then to the
               heavens for the means to get through this.As STARKS lets go at last, JACKIE looks back at him, sensing
               the connection even if she doesn't know it yet.STARKS turns and stumbles as he walks back to his car.
               LORENSON moves to help him, but STARKS tells her not to with
               his eyes. He makes his way to the car on his own.MONTAGE:INT. LIVING ROOM, JEAN AND JACKIE'S HOUSE, DAY, 1992122.JEAN sits down and starts to open the LETTER. Starks' voice,
               as we hear it now, is presumably from parts of the LETTER
               he's written to her.INT. LORENSON'S CAR, DUSK, 1992LORENSON looks over to STARKS, who stares painfully out the
               window. They drive on in silence.STARKS (V.O.)I was 25 years old the first time I
                           died. It didn't end anything though.

                            the odds. And sometimes I agree

                            knowledge of death. That it can all

               desk, is a bottle of WHISKEY. He closes his eyes as he
               administers to himself whatever aid he can...INT. JACKIE AND JEAN'S HOUSE, DAY, DECEMBER 31, 1992123.JEAN is reading each page avidly, affected by this man's last
               words.STARKS (V.O.)It's scary...and lucky...how much we
                           can forget. Scary because we think
                           the past gives us our bearing, and
                           lucky because in those moments I'm
                           talking about, you realize it
                           doesn't. And it never had to.INT. SMALL BAR, CANADA, NIGHT, 1992TENNY (Officer Harrison's murderer) is at the bar ordering a
               drink from the BARTENDER. As he gets his DRINK, he slaps a
               BILL down on the counter and turns around to survey the bar...INT. JACKIE'S ROOM, JACKIE AND JEAN'S HOUSE, EVENING, 1992JACKIE rummages in a box of her personal belongings, looking
               for something specific in them. She stops finally when she
               finds STARKS' DOG TAGS. She takes them out slowly and puts
               them around her neck.STARKS (V.O.)I am not a crazy man, even though
                           they mistook me for one. I live in
                           the same world as the rest of you.
                           Only I saw more of it.Then, after a moment of staring down at them, she tucks them
               under her sweater.INT. CAPTAIN MEDLEY'S HOME, NIGHT, 1992CAPTAIN MEDLEY holds a beer as he stares blankly at a TV

               Lorenson, thanking her without words but with his eyes.
               LORENSON smiles as she looks back sadly at Starks' even more
               weakened self.STARKS (V.O.)And the seeing is the only way you
                           can hear what the truth around you
                           is saying: you can always start
                           believing in things you don't
                           already believing in. And, while
                           you're alive, it's never too late.124.Then he turns and walks out, closing the door so that Starks'
               room and the screen darken at the same time.INT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, NEW YEAR'S EVE, 1992TWO PAIRS of legs walk down a corridor, darkened by the
               night, through the now familiar passage to the basement...STARKS is not restrained this time though we don't see who is
               walking down the hall with him. He runs his hand over his
               forehead and looks at it when he's done. STILL NO CUT.They slow down their pace as they round the corner, as STARKS
               appears dizzier and dizzier. He doesn't stop and the PERSON
               beside him doesn't see how weak he is... until STARKS TRIPS.In slow motion, we hear a DISTANT, GARBLED VOICE CALL OUT...DISTORTED VOICENo! Wa...atch out!But STARKS' head hits the GLASS CASE of the FIRE EXTINGUISHER
               on the wall, as it was destined to. In the terrific SHOWER OF
               GLASS, one PIECE cuts a neat, deep, fatal GASH in Starks'
               head.BLOOD starts to flow. As STARKS' eyes struggle to regain
               their focus, we see the BLURRED, indiscernible FACE of the
               PERSON leaning over him to see if he's all right.The details start to make sense, even to Starks. This is the
               WOUND they said he died from.INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, NEW YEAR'S EVE, 1992STARKS collapses on the familiar slab, ready to be strapped
               into the Jacket one final time. BLOOD pours from his head
               onto the floor.The PERSON with him struggles to get all of Starks' weight
               onto the metal slab. She's doing it as carefully, and gently,
               as she can -- taking observable care with every strap of the
               JACKET, almost as if the act itself is a humane one.When the HANDS finally reach the straps around his neck and
               the hardest part of the struggle has passed, STARKS smiles
               kindly, and thankfully, into the single overhead LIGHT in the
               room that obscures the face of the person strapping him in.As the drawer is pushed in, one of the STRAPS gets caught on
               the side, CUTTING STARKS' ARM. We hear a small CRY in the
               room. Then the HANDS adjust the strap and slowly push STARKS
               in.125.INT. JACKET/TUNNELIt's more beautiful and serene inside than it's ever been
               before. This time, as he travels through the tunnel, it's as
               though he's traveling in a heaven of his own. The IMAGES he
               sees are the best moments of his past -- connected in a
               tranquil, fluid narrative that suggest STARKS has finally
               retrieved his memory without it haunting him...STARKS (V.O.)I promise you, Jean. No matter how
                            bad the days and things around you
                            look, they look better awake than
                            they do asleep. I can offer you
                            some proof: when you die, there's
                            only one thing you want to have
                            happen...sometimes so badly it
                            comes true, I guess. [Beat] You

               she stares at the closed drawer, like looking at it is one
               way to look after Starks.INT. JACKIE AND JEAN'S HOUSE, VERMONT, 1992126.JEAN puts down STARKS' LETTER and walks out of the kitchen
               and watches JACKIE sitting absently on the couch, looking
               past the TV.JEAN kneels wordlessly beside her daughter and looks her
               daughter in the eye. JACKIE looks back curiously as JEAN
               wraps her arms around Jackie's LEGS and rests her head in her
               lap, holding onto her with the dearness of having narrowly
               missed a tragedy.FADE TO BLACK.EXT. DINER, SMALL TOWN VERMONT, 2005Over the sounds of CARS slushing in the snow, an IMAGE fades
               up slowly on the screen, until we see it's STARKS, standing
               in the parking lot outside the diner once more.This time he seems situated, and hopeful. After a slightly
               longer wait than the first time, JACKIE walks out -- in the
               same way as before except that she wears a NURSE'S UNIFORM
               and an unmistakable air of vitality.Jackie looks directly at Starks and we see the same
               attraction between them teeming even more than before. Even
               as a physically injured man in jeans and a flannel, with a
               BLEEDING CUT on his head and no coat in the cold, STARKS is
               someone we see she wants to be near.Then we see JACKIE as STARKS does: she looks beautiful,
               alive, happy and just like the woman he never wanted to
               leave. She approaches Starks warmly, less suspicious of the
               world -- and less devastated by it -- than we remember her
               being.JACKIEHey there. [Beat] You ok?STARKS revels in the moment. In their reunion.STARKSI think so.JACKIEYou're bleeding pretty bad there.STARKS touches his FOREHEAD in a panic and, seeing the BLOOD
               on his hands, looks up at her, terrified. Sensing this, she
               moves closer to calm him.JACKIEIt's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just
                            a cut. We can get it fixed.(MORE)127.JACKIE (cont'd)

               to the car, much like before...STARKSThanks.INT. JACKIE'S CAR, 2005STARKS can hardly keep his eyes off her when her CELL PHONE

               awkward after the call.JACKIESorry about that. It was my mom.STARKS smiles back warmly at her; he gets it more than she
               knows.STARKSNothin' to worry about there.EXT. OVERHEAD, VERMONT HIGHWAY, 2005Jackie's car pulls onto the highway, alongside the other,
               more modern cars on the highway.JACKIE (O.S.)How you doin'?STARKSI'm doing fine.The happy sound of their engine on the highway continues,
               uninterrupted, for some seconds, before, first faintly then
               louder, we hear a racking, all too familiar sound: the DRAWER
               creaking as it's opened once more...THE END
