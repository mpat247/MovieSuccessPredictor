     CLOSE ON DEAN's HEEL - a hollow compartment reveals a
     miniature tracking device. The MAN removes it, then
     returns the shoe."BRILL" (CONT'D)A tracker. Thousand yard range.
            They're close.

     The MAN reaches in a trash can, removes a potato-chip
     bag, wraps it around the tracker and flushes it down
     the toilet."BRILL" (CONT'D)C'mon.

     "BRILL" goes through the window. DEAN eyes the window,
     not sure. He eyes the door. Same feeling.EXT. LOADING DECK - MOMENT LATERDEAN crawls through the window to a loading dock.
     "BRILL" motions him to follow as he moves off into the
     shadows.

     The sounds of the window OPENING behind them, followed
     by FOOTSTEPS. "BRILL" shoves Dean behind a dumpster and
     removes his gun as two men run by. The STEPS FADE.
     "BRILL" looks. They're gone.EXT. FERRY TERMINAL - NIGHTEstablishing. A closed farmer's market by the terminal.
     Several cars are parked. One's a cab. "BRILL" opens the
     driver's door. DEAN grabs the front passenger door."BRILL"No. In back like you're a customer.INT. CAB - NIGHT"BRILL" sits in the driver's seat, eyes flickering to
     all views, as DEAN climbs in the back. "BRILL" flips on
     the meter and guns into traffic."BRILL"What happened?DEANIt started with the information you
            gave me on DePinto. After we talked,
            he agreed to resign. Next, a phony
            detective asked me about Daniel
            Zavitz. Then an investigator
            questioned me about an extortion
            scheme they claimed Zavitz was
            behind. The FBI started looking
            into mob connections. A doctored
            picture in the paper. Overnight,
            I'm ruined. Wife. job, bank
            accounts, everything gone.

     "BRILL" eyes the mirror. A BLACK CHEVY appears several
     car lengths behind."BRILL"DePinto's dead.DEANOh Jesus."BRILL"They found him yesterday folded
            neatly in a car trunk. What about
            Zavitz?

     "BRILL" starts to weave in and out of traffic. He looks
     in the mirror - the Chevy's also weaving several cars
     behind.DEANI don't know anything about Zavitz."BRILL"You said he was behind an extortion
            scheme.DEANTheysaid he was behind an
            extortion scheme.

     "BRILL" whips the cab around a corner, accelerating."BRILL"And you were the last one to talk
            to him.DEANYes."BRILL"What'd he say to you?DEANNothing."BRILL"What'd he give to you?DEANNothing."BRILL"Don't bullshit me, I can save your
            life.DEANI'm telling you, I--

     The ride from hell gets worse as "BRILL" screeches
     another turn. The car ahead stops and "BRILL" screeches
     past on two wheels.DEAN (CONT'D)I just gave him my card."BRILL"He didn't give you an address? He
            didn't give you a phone number?DEANNothing. Two nights later I was
            robbed. I'm pretty sure they were pros.

     "BRILL" takes an impossible left into another alley.
     The Chevy follows. "BRILL"'s good. The guy in the
     Chevy's better.DEAN (CONT'D)Um...who's that?"BRILL"Don't know. Did you check everywhere?
            Maybe it was hidden in something.
            Maybe there was someone else--DEANSomeone else?"BRILL"Maybe you bumped into someone who
            took it and you didn't even know.

     The cab is rear-ended hard by the Chevy. Their necks
     snap back from the force."BRILL" (CONT'D)Shit!

     WHAM! They're hit again. "BRILL" pulls out a communicator."BRILL" (CONT'D)209 to anyone! I need some help here!DEANWho are you calling?!

     WHACK! "BRILL" back-hands DEAN with his fist, knocking
     him silly as WHAM!--the cab's rear-ended again."BRILL"(trying again)
            This is 209! Does anyone copy?!

     Then "BRILL" sees that the alley empties into a busy
     street, then a bakery shop.

     He slams the brakes. Tires screech smoke but it's no
     use. The powerful Chevy pushes the cab, bumper to
     bumper, toward the street. "BRILL" grips the wheel.
     It's all he can do as the cab rockets into cross
     traffic and--

     BLAM! They're broad-sided by a delivery truck. The cab
     is shoved sideways along the street and into a fire-
     hydrant, finally stopping under jetting water from the
     broken main.

     DEAN slowly opens his eyes. Water pours in everywhere.
     "BRILL" is sticking halfway through a window, not
     moving. Seeing "BRILL"'s pistol, DEAN grabs it and
     crawls from the wreckage.EXT. STREET - NIGHTDEAN climbs from the wreck as BYSTANDERS approach.WOMANLook out! He's got a gun!

     They back away as DEAN gets to his feet and looks
     around. Off to the side he sees the Chevy, waiting like
     a coiled snake.

     DEAN limps into the crowd. He rounds the corner to
     ANOTHER STREET and now he's running with all he's got left.INT. DEAN'S HOUSE/STUDY - NIGHTSTACY is at the desk looking at the latest edition of

     A hand suddenly clicks down the phone hook. DEAN turns
     to see a MAN, late 50's, gruff and alert. It's the guy
     driving the Chevy.MANPut the phone down. Do as I say.

     DEAN does nothing, temporarily frozen. A pistol jabs

     And with that, he's gone.

     DEAN eyes the gun. He walks to the ledge, looking at
     the city.

     DEAN'S POV: Several vehicles quietly pull up to the
     building. MEN storm out an move inside.

     DEAN quickly backs away.INT. BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHTDEAN races for the stairwell two steps at a time. He
     hears the SOUND of a DOOR OPENING somewhere below.VOICE (O.S.)303 to 301. Floor one secured.
            Moving to two.

     DEAN retreats upward, then he hears SOMEONE COMING DOWN.
     Trapped. He opens the door on '3' and is about to run
     when he sees a security camera directly above.

     Grabbing a fire extinguisher, he pulls the pin. Spray
     coats the lens. Then he yanks a FIRE ALARM. A HORN BLARES.

     DEAN runs for the second stairwell when he sees JONES
     stepping out. DEAN looks back at the stairwell he left.
     That door's opening as well.

     Trapped.

     Using the extinguisher, DEAN smashes the glass door to
     an office and goes inside. JONES starts to enter when a
     shot rips into the wall, convincing him otherwise. He
     retreats as the BLARING FIRE ALARM STOPS.

     DEAN races through the suite of offices trying locked
     door after locked door. Finally, one opens and he
     rushes in and tries to lock it behind himself.

     No lock.

     He sees the MEN and they see him. He slides a desk
     against the door, then backs away, pistol ready.JONES (O.S.)(disturbingly calm)
            Open the door, Mr. Dean. There's
            nowhere to go. We'd just like to talk.

     Seeing a phone, DEAN grabs it.

     No tone. Just a RECORDING of Nancy Sinatra's song
     "These Boots are Made for Walking".JONES (O.S.)It'd be easier for all of us if you
            just come out. Nothing'll happen.

     The door keeps pushing.

     DEAN FIRES high.

     The pushing stops.

     Then DEAN hears the distant sound of SIRENS approaching.
     DEAN rips off his sweater, takes out a lighter, and
     sets the sweater on fire.

     He throws it into a garbage can and tosses styrofoam
     cups in on top of it.

     small cylindrical device drops into the room.A STUN GRENADE.DEAN ducks as a BLINDING FLASH rocks the room.

     DEAN looks for an out. He sees an emergency stop handle.

     He YANKS it forward. PASSENGERS yell. The brakes lock
     and SCREECH. The train slows. Then stops.

     DEAN opens the door.

     And jumps. He looks around. Just black curved track in
     either direction. He starts running.

     Then he hears it.

     The horrible SCREECHING of an approaching train.

     Trapped.

     On one side, the train he left. On the other, a wall.

     He runs down the track with all that's left.

     PRATT and JONES reach the open door and see the
     oncoming train bearing down on DEAN. They duck in as
     the train SWISHES by.

     DEAN lays flat between the tracks, his face kissing
     greasy ground as the train screeches over him.

     Tons of angry steel are teasing his shirt fabric.

     Then it's over. The train's gone. DEAN's alive.

     He gets up to see PRATT and JONES leap to the tracks.DEAN(under his breath)

     Dean. Then BRILL sees him--

     discovers he's not in the car.

     BRILL pushes in the cigarette lighter.

     JONES dumps everything from the Taurus into the
