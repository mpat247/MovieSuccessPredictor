Shafts of eroded light slice into the depths of the Hudson
River. The ghostly melody of "Lili Marlene," the ache of the
war-time lover, plays as a strange SHADOW drifts into view.

We realize it is a BODY.ALLEN (V.O.)Some things, once you've loved
          them, become yours forever.

The body BREAKS the surface and we see the face of its owner
---- DAVID KAMMERER, 33, bearded, handsome. He is clothed, open
white shirt, khakis. Dead.ALLEN (V.O.)And if you try to let them go...

Suddenly, a breath: he comes back to life.

David floats back to LUCIEN CARR, 20, (blonde, beautiful,
shirtless and terrified), waist deep in the water.

The scene is playing in REVERSE MOTION.ALLEN (V.O.)They only circle back and return to
          you.

David's body LIFTS into the young man's arms. We see David's
feet and hands are TIED together with shoelaces. Stones rise
back into his pockets.ALLEN (V.O.)They become part of who you are...

A stain of blood on David's chest shrinks, vanishes.

David's eyes OPEN.CUT TO:INT. THE TOMBS - DAYLUCIEN...or they destroy you.

From behind the bars of a jail cell, Lucien Carr (the young
man from the opening) finishes reading from a paper
MANUSCRIPT in his hand.2.Lucien, furious, crumples it up.LUCIENYou can't show this to anyone.

We PULL BACK to reveal the author of the manuscript: a
eighteen-year-old ALLEN GINSBERG. Unslept and exhausted. But
determined.

Allen stares defiantly at Lucien from the other side of the
bars.ALLENThen tell the truth, Lu.LUCIENYou weren't even there. It's your
          truth. It's fiction.

Allen grabs for his manuscript back, but Lucien pulls it out
of reach.LUCIENYou wanted him gone too. You sent
          him to me.

Allen reaches through the bars and SNATCHES the paper.

Lucien won't let go -- it's a tug of war between the two
boys, two wills. Allen yanks the paper from Lucien's grip and
wins. Lucien, panicking.LUCIEN (CONT'D)Please. You'll kill me with that.

Allen turns and races towards the exit of the prison.
Desperate, Lucien calls out after him.LUCIENAllen! No!

Allen doesn't turn. An alarm HAMMERS through the prison.LUCIENAllen!   No! DON'T...!CUT TO BLACK.INSERT TITLE: KILL YOUR DARLINGSCUT TO:3.EXT. GINSBERG HOME - NIGHTSUPER: PATERSON, NEW JERSEY. 1943. ONE YEAR EARLIER.Over a strip of working-class row homes, we hear the sounds
of a radio announcer giving a dispatch from the war front.RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)American daylight bombers were busy
          again, as our liberators with
          fighter escort continue the air
          offensive with another sock at
          German coastal installations in
          France.INT. GINSBERG HOME - NIGHTThe radio continues playing to a modest home. We see a young
man cleaning house, sweeping in the background.RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)But the Germans report a big new
          red army push toward Romania. This
          is World War news.

As the war report ends, a stuffy musical piece begins. We
hear a groan from the young man.

From out of the background emerges Allen Ginsberg (now 17,
fresh-faced, horn-rimmed glasses, dutiful son). The kind of
kid who takes care of everything.

He storms up to the radio, switches the station to a fast-
paced boogie-woogie number. He smiles and dances joyfully to
the up-beat number with his broom.

The door slams. Allen looks up, caught in the act, to see his
father LOUIS (40's, school teacher, Jewish working-class
poet) home from work. Allen accidentally drops the broom.LOUISHow was she today?

Louis turns off the music. The playful mood dies. Allen spots
the mail in his father's hand.ALLENFine. Anything for me?LOUISWhy? You expecting something?

Allen looks down, a bad liar.4.ALLENNo.

Suddenly, from upstairs, the sound of glass shattering. Then
a woman whimpering in pain. Allen, worried, looks off, dread
in his face. His father just sighs.LOUISI told you it wouldn't work.

Allen rushes upstairs.INT. MASTER BEDROOM, GINSBERG HOME - NIGHTAllen runs into a dark room, flips on the light.ALLENMom?

His mother NAOMI (early 40's, Jewish, deep personality
disorder) squats in the corner of the room, in a dirty
bathrobe. Her knuckles are bleeding.NAOMIYou've got to get me out of here.
          He nailed the windows shut while I
          was in the bath.

She motions to the shattered window pane across the room.
Allen sees her blood on the sill, where she tried to escape.
He moves towards her, to console her. What he's good at.ALLENDad didn't do that. I nailed the
          windows. Because you're not right.

Naomi, in the midst of a paranoid attack, puts her finger to
her mouth.NAOMIShhh...Allen. He can hear you!

Allen wraps his mother's hand with a dish towel.ALLENYou have to rest. Clear your head.
          Do you want to go back to
          Greystone?NAOMIHe wouldn't dare put me back there.5.ALLENThen listen to me.NAOMISHHHH. He can hear you!

She's losing it. Allen quickly thinks, turns to her bureau.
He pulls out a RECORD, starts the phonograph and turns up the
volume.ALLENCan he still hear me?

A BRAHMS WALTZ plays.NAOMIWhat did you say?

Allen turns the music up all the way. Allen mimes deafness.
Finally, she understands: their sounds are drowned out by the
music.

Allen reaches for her. She finally softens, takes his hand.

As mother and son waltz together with the music, Naomi
clutches Allen to her, like he's the only thing keeping her
sane. Because he is.NAOMIDon't ever leave me.

Allen, trapped, over her shoulder.

From the doorway, we see that Louis has been watching the
whole time.EXT. GINSBERG FRONT PORCH - NIGHTOverwhelmed, Allen shakes on the front stairs. She's not
well. The faint sound of jazz, fun from someone else's home
from down the block. Louis comes out onto the porch, with an
open LETTER in hand from the mail pile. He's upset.LOUISWere you even going to tell me you
          applied?!

Allen spies the "Columbia University" seal on the front. He's
been caught. He looks down, ashamed.6.ALLENI didn't want her to know.
              (beat)
          It was a dream anyway.

Louis lights his own cigarette. Offers his son one. He
declines.LOUIS(talking to himself,

          Trilling's there. Van Doren.
          English Professors. Important

Louis sits beside his son.LOUISLove that is hoarded,
          molds at last.

Allen, surprised to hear his Dad reciting one of his poems.LOUISUntil we know,
          the only thing we have--ALLENis what we give away.LOUISIs what we hand away. Have, hand.
          Consonance.ALLENGive, is. Assonance.LOUISI wrote the goddamn poem. Go write
          your own.

Louis hands over the letter. The hardest thing he's ever
done.

Allen takes the envelope, rips it open. He's looking at the
response in shock. Louis tries to read his son's face.ALLENI got in.LOUISYou got in?!7.ALLENI got into Columbia University!LOUISYou got into Columbia University?!

Allen and his father embrace.CUT TO:EXT. COLUMBIA QUAD - DAYFirst day of college. Allen crosses the grand Ivy League
campus in awe. Before him, the staggering facade of the
library like the Parthenon. A troop of Navy midshipmen pass
by. Wartime is on.INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - DAYAllen sets his bag on his bed. He notices on one wall are
patriotic posters, exercise posters. He's already got a
roommate.

He eyes a map of the New York City subway system. He can't
believe he's really here in the big city. He walks over to
it.

Allen studies the map, his finger gliding down to Greenwich
Village.LUKE (O.S.)You don't wanna go down there.

His roommate LUKE, 18, buzz cut, in a sweaty Columbia
sweatshirt, leans over him.LUKELand of the fairies. Head there and
          you never come back.

          Luke Detweiler, Danville, Virginia.ALLENAllen Ginsberg.LUKE(bright smile)
          You're Jewish, right?

Allen nods. Luke smacks him on the shoulder.8.LUKEI'm getting good at telling.INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - DAYThe beautiful main hall of Columbia University's Butler
Library. It's Ivy League tradition meets thousands of years
of scholarship.

A pompous TOUR GUIDE shows off museum-like glass vitrines to
new and prospective students with their families.TOUR GUIDEThe South Hall library is a church,
          and these are the sacraments.

Allen stumbles along on the tour. The tour guide points to
the contents of the vitrines: the wonders of literary
history.TOUR GUIDEOriginal folios of the most
          important texts in history.
          Beowolf. First folio Hamlet. The
          Gutenberg Bible.

Allen looks down, amazed. That's Shakespeare's handwriting.TOURThese are among the University's
          most prized possessions.

Suddenly, in a reflection in the glass, a flash of RED
catches Allen's eye.LUCIEN (O.S.)Let's hear a bit, shall we?

Allen turns to see Lucien Carr (now 19, devilish, stunningly
handsome) LEAP onto a library desk with a book in hand. He
wears a distinctive red CRAVAT that only the truly beautiful
can pull off. The entire room hushes.LUCIEN(reciting)
          On a Sunday afternoon, when the
          shutters are down and the
          proletariat possesses the street...

The tour guide looks around confused.9.LUCIEN...there are certain thoroughfares
          which remind one of nothing less...

Lucien gets on his knees and THRUSTS a lamp between his legs.LUCIEN...than a big cancerous cock.

Parents look around in shock. A female student is instantly
aroused. The prim PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN clomps over.PERMISSIONS LIBRARIANWhat is this nonsense?LUCIENHenry Miller.PERMISSIONS LIBRARIANGet down immediately. That book is
          restricted.LUCIENWhich is why I committed it to
          memory.PERMISSIONS LIBRARIANSecurity!

As two Campus Security Guards rush in, Lucien leaps down in
front of Allen.LUCIENAlert the press! Tell them Lucien
          Carr is innocent!

Lucien flees, rushes out of the library.TOUR GUIDEThat was highly unusual. Campus is
          actually quite quiet. Moving on.

But Allen doesn't hear, he grins to himself. Who the hell was
that?PROFESSOR STEEVES (V.O.)The Victorian sonnet has the
          balance of three tenets.INT. LECTURE HALL - DAYPatrician, old-guard PROFESSOR STEEVES lectures on the first
day of class, Allen dutifully taking notes in his journal.10.PROFESSOR STEEVESRhyme, meter, conceit. Without this
          balance, a poem becomes slack,
          sloppy. An untucked shirt.

Allen disagrees and raises his hand.ALLENProfessor Steeves, then how do you
          explain Whitman?

No one interrupts Professor Steeves. Murmurs from around the
class. Steeves locks down his gaze on Allen.PROFESSOR STEEVESSay more. Two more sentences.ALLENHe hated rhyme and meter. The whole
          point was untucking your shirt.

Professor Steeves smiles to himself. There's one of them
every year.PROFESSOR STEEVESWhat's your name?ALLENAllen Ginsberg.PROFESSOR STEEVESGinsberg? Your father perhaps is
          the poet Louis Ginsberg?

Allen nods.PROFESSOR STEEVESHe writes rhyming, metered verse.
          Why do you think he chose that
          form?

All eyes on Allen.ALLENBecause it's easier.

The class titters. Professor Steeves hushes them.PROFESSOR STEEVESThis university exists because of
          tradition and form. Would you
          rather this building be built by
          engineers or Whitman and his boys
          at play?11.Allen, realizing he is trapped, unable to answer. Professor
Steeves smiles victoriously and writes on the blackboard.PROFESSOR STEEVESThere can be no creation before
          imitation.

The other students take note. Allen sighs, follows suit. From
the back row, Lucien watches Allen and unsheathes a grin.INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - NIGHTLuke, dressed in a suit, puts on cologne. He looks back at
Allen who is copying from a tome of sonnets.LUKEShut the books. We're taking my
          brother with us to the social. He
          ships out tomorrow.ALLENI can't. You see how much I've got
          to do.LUKEHe's Navy. It's catnip for the
          skirts.

Luke pulls out his own waistband and sprays some cologne down
the front. Allen shakes his head. Luke shrugs.LUKEYou hymies are really all about
          work, huh?

Luke slams the door behind. Allen, alone stares out the
window.

A record starts up down the hall. Clarinet, strings. Allen's
ears prick up. He knows this tune.

It's the same BRAHMS from his mother's bedroom.INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHTAllen walks down a darkened hallway, the music leading him
forward. He reaches a door with a lit transom. He knocks.

The unlocked door creaks open.12.INT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - NIGHTA mattress lies on the floor, a phonograph on top. Candles
light the room. Books for furniture. And Lucien on the floor,
reading the Times and smoking.ALLENBrahms?

Allen walks inside. Lucien looks up, surprised.LUCIENFinally. An oasis in this
          wasteland.

Nervous, Allen tries to make conversation.ALLENHow come you're not at the social?LUCIENOnly the most anti-social have to
          go to an event actually called one.
          Libation?

Lucien rises and grabs a wine bottle corked with a sock.
Allen looks nervously towards the door.ALLENYou drink in your room?!LUCIENHow does a horrible bottle of
          Chianti sound?

Lucien inverts two small glasses and pours. Allen stares. He
doesn't break the rules.ALLENI don't drink.LUCIENFreshman?ALLENYes.

Lucien hands him his glass.LUCIENExcellent. I love first times. I
          want my whole life to be composed
          of them. Life is only interesting
          if life is wide.13.Lucien toasts Allen's glass.LUCIENTo Walt Whitman, you dirty bastard.

Allen, mortified, not sure how to take that reference as
Lucien knocks his wine back in one gulp.LUCIENHow's your Yeats? Have you read A
          Vision?

He tosses Allen a BOOK. Dog-eared, underlined and crumbling.ALLENNever heard of it.LUCIENIt's completely brilliant and
          impossible. He says life is round:
          we're stuck on this wheel. Living.
          And dying.

Allen opens the book, looks through the old pages, sees a
strange symbol: a diagram of a celestial WHEEL.LUCIENAn endless circle. Until. Someone
          breaks it. You came in here, you
          rupture the pattern. Bang: the
          whole world...ALLEN                            LUCIENGets wider.                      Gets wider.

Lucien looks at Allen, amazed.LUCIENHow did you...?ALLENConsonance. Reiteration of themes.

Lucien, intrigued, circles in close.LUCIENAre you a writer? Because I've got
          a job for a writer.

Allen, mesmerized.ALLENNo. I'm not.14.LUCIENWell, you're not anything yet.

This boy so close, the rush of contact. From down the hall...HALL MONITOR (O.S.)Ginsberg?!

Allen doesn't even register his name. Lucien smirks.LUCIENIsn't that you?HALL MONITOR (O.S.)Ginsberg?!

Allen groans, snaps out of it.ALLENWhat?!HALL MONITOR (O.S.)Phone call!

Allen reluctantly hands Lucien back the BOOK.ALLENI'll be back.INT. DORM HALLWAY - CONTINUOUSThe Hall Monitor hands Allen the phone.ALLENHello?NAOMI (O.S.)I found the wires.INT. HALLWAY, GINSBERG HOME - NIGHTNaomi grips the phone desperately. We see she has stripped
the wallpaper from the wall and pulled the telephone wire out
from underneath.NAOMIHe's trying to get inside my head.ALLEN (O.S.)Dad is not trying to get inside
          your head, okay? Put him on.15.NAOMIHe's not home. He left.INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHTAllen, confused. Up the hallway, a door locks.ALLENWhere'd he go?INT.

          with you?!ALLENNo, he's not here with me.

Lucien quickly waves goodbye to Allen, heads down the
staircase. Allen, torn between his mother and this boy.ALLEN(into the phone)

Allen hangs up on his mother and races after Lucien.INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHTAllen, breathless, storms down a flight of stairs, catches up
to Lucien. Lucien turns, loving this. The puppy following his
new master.LUCIENComing?EXT. COLUMBIA ENTRANCE - NIGHTLucien throws his jacket over Allen's shoulder and leads him
into the wild city around the corner.LUCIENWelcome to the edge of the world.

The sound of the IRT screeching takes us to the SUBWAY MAP
from Allen's dorm room which comes to life.

A RED LINE glides down the map from Columbia University all
the way...to Greenwich Village.CUT TO:INT. STAIRS/APARTMENT, 48 MORTON STREET - NIGHTAllen, anxious, follows Lucien up a crowded staircase to a
West Village apartment.

The sounds of a party spill out onto the landing and beyond.
It's pure bohemia here.17.Smoke, artists flirting, arguing. Allen sees...

A black man making out with a white woman. An older, elegant
woman sharing a cigarette with a boy half her age.

She stares seductively at Allen. Lucien enjoying himself
immensely. This is what a first time looks like.LUCIENAllen in Wonderland.

Lucien grabs a DRUNK YOUNG GIRL from the crowd, kisses her
passionately. Then lets her go, keeps walking.ALLENDo you know her?!LUCIENNo, and I don't plan on it. She
          tasted like imported sophistication
          and domestic cigarettes.INT. BATHROOM, 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHTA makeshift bar in a sink full of ice. Lucien scavenges
through empty bottles in the sink, looking for any remaining
alcohol.LUCIEN(calling out)
          Dave! Where's the liquor?! I'll be
          right back.

As Lucien walks off, Allen tries to make himself
inconspicuous and sits down on the tub.BILL (O.S.)Hrffrff hrffrfffrfrfrrf.

Allen looks down to see WILLIAM BURROUGHS (aka BILL, 29,
tall, gaunt, wry), in a suit, sprawled out in the bathtub: a
gas mask over his mouth. Bill motions to the side of the tub.BILL(through the mask)
          You're...pinching...

Allen stands up, realizing his foot is on a snaking black
tube leading to a metal canister of gas.ALLENSorry. Are you all right?18.BILL(long exhale)
          Artifacts in the visual field, some

          Know thyself. And beshit thyself.
          Ever done that?

Allen shakes his head no. Bill turns off the gas. Offers a
joint to Allen.ALLENOh no, thanks. I don't do...the
          cannabis.

Bill eyes Allen, skeptically.BILLShow me the man both sober and
          happy, and I'll show you the
          crinkled anus of a lying asshole.

Allen raises an eyebrow. Lucien returns with a paper in hand.LUCIENAllen, Willy. Willy, Allen, Lucien
          reefer.

Lucien takes the joint.

Bill puts the tube of gas back in his mouth, back to
business. Lucien grabs Allen's hand, pulls him to the party.ALLEN(whispered)
          Is he a criminal?LUCIENHe wishes he were a criminal. The
          Burroughs family is richer than
          God.ALLENHe looks like a criminal.19.LUCIENHe's a Harvard man, and he's going
          to be an amazing artist. His
          current medium is himself.

Allen spots the TERM PAPER in Lucien's hand.ALLENWhat's that?LUCIENBunk for school. Now, come on, I
          want you to meet our host.INT. LIVING ROOM, 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHTDAVID KAMMERER, the man we saw dead at the film's opening,
runs his fingers on the rim of a wine glass. He's sharp, the
mayor of this scene. An eerie hum from the glass.DAVIDWhat there is, darlings and
          demoiselles, is a circle. Life is
          round. Patterns, routines, a wheel
          of self-abuse. Margaret, don't even
          deny it.

Allen turns to Lucien.ALLEN(whispered)
          Sounds like you.LUCIENBecause it was me. First.

David sees the boys talking. He eyes Allen, curiously.DAVIDUntil. The the disruption we long

          apartment.LUCIENActually I invited him.DAVIDNone of us notice him. Look at him.
          Why would we bother?

In his tucked shirt and creased pants, Allen realizes the
entire party is scrutinizing, judging him.DAVIDSo the pattern of our evening, our
          lives, holds. But under the right
          circumstances, even he might change
          the world.

Jazz music sparks, PRE-LAP from where this party's going
next. Lucien eyes Allen -- an idea forming.CUT TO:INT. TAVERN - NIGHTThe party continuing at this underground speakeasy. Straight,
gay, young, old, a subterranean zoo. A jazz signer owns the

Allen.DAVIDSo you just met Lucien in the lunch

          godforsaken line.

David and Bill share a knowing look. Lucien returns to the
table and slams a glass down.LUCIENSome earjob at the bar just called
          me "boy." So I stole his drink.

Allen smiles a mile wide. He's in.

Suddenly, the jazz singer stops. The band puts down their
instruments. POLICEMEN escort a businessman and another
gentleman out of the bathroom, in HANDCUFFS. The mood in the
bar chills.BAR-GOER (O.S.)Fucking perverts.

shoves the nurse off Naomi.ALLENGet off!

From deep within, Allen can see she is still there, and we
can see she knows that it's too late.NAOMIThis is your fault.

breaks down. Lucien, mute witness to it all.

A beat of understanding between them. Lucien lays down. Allen
takes his cigarette, lays next to him.ALLENI've been thinking about what Yeats

          way I see possible.LUCIEN (O.S.)Oh please. Die already.

We PULL BACK again to see Lucien beside, also with a noose
around his neck. Both of them on chairs. Their nooses are
attached to the same pipe.LUCIENWhere's the verve? The brio?!

From atop the chair, Lucien kicks his record player with his
foot. Grand classical music screeches to a start.27.LUCIENIf it be that I am indulging my

Lucien shoves Allen. Allen trips off the chair, the noose
snaps tight...and suddenly he's hanging in mid-air. He
struggles. Lucien tries to help, but falls off his own chair.

The pipe starts to bend.

Allen and Lucien panic as they swing through the room,

drummer taper down to a still. Allen looks around, scared and
confused. What is happening?

A spotlight cuts through the room, capturing the singer's
sweaty ecstasy, the bassist's fingers mid-plucking. The room
freezes.

Unlit cigarette dangling from his lip, Allen turns to Bill.31.Bill holds up his finger - it is on fire. He lights Allen's
cigarette with the flame. We have entered into another

Lucien leans over a young woman, a statue at a table with a
young man in military attire.LUCIEN(whispered in her ear)

The girl comes to life and clambers over the young man to a
second, more attractive soldier. And kisses him. The pair
erupt into life, into desire.

Lucien and Allen sit on the stage beneath the frozen
musicians. Lucien pulls out a BOY SCOUT KNIFE.

Wraps Allen's hand in a fist around the blade.

He pulls the knife free. Allen winces in pain.

the exit of the prison. Desperate, Lucien calls out after
him.LUCIENAllen! No! DON'T!

An alarm HAMMERS through the prison, sending us to...INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAYThe New York City's District Attorney's SECRETARY at her
reception desk. Allen enters the room, his deposition in
hand. He is visibly nervous as he approaches the desk.ALLENAllen Ginsberg.SECRETARYHe'll be with you in a minute.

reads, "The Night in Question."INT. JAIL - DAYFrom his prison bed, Lucien stares down the cellblock,

ground.

Alive.INT. DISTRICT'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAYThe secretary hangs up the phone.SECRETARYMr. Ginsberg. He's ready for you.

          this?93.INT. COLUMBIA DEAN'S OFFICE - DAYAllen's manuscript HITS the Dean's desk.

The deposition's title page now reads "The Night in Question
by Allen Ginsberg." It's been refashioned into a novella.

Allen sits in the same chair where Lucien was reprimanded.
Professor Steeves sits silently beside the Dean at his desk.DEANNo, please tell me. Professor
          Steeves says you submitted it as
          your final.

Allen, nervous in the chair.DEANWell, then, let me tell you. It is
          smutty and absurd.ALLENBut you finished it.

The Dean loses his patience.DEANYou've taken incompletes in two
          classes. And you are already on
          academic probation. There are rules
          you agreed to upon admittance into
          this university. And you have
          managed to break and keep breaking
          them. You don't seem to have much
          respect for this institution. So
          you may either retract this fiction
          as your final. Or you may choose to
          be expelled. What will it be?

Professor Steeves eyes Allen.ALLENFine.

Allen stands, making his decision.ALLENConsider me expelled.

reach.DEANThis remains with us.94.Professor Steeves keeps a close eye on Allen as he leaves the
office.INT. GINSBERG HOME - DAYBack in the Ginsberg residence, but the house is quiet now,
peaceful. No Naomi. The radio playing softly in the living
room. Louis jotting down verse on the back of the mail.

Allen, shirt untucked, composing a poem on the back of a
bill.

They both reach for their cigarettes at the same time.

Louis looks at Allen writing. A mirror between father and
son. A moment of warm appreciation.

Louis hands Allen a package from the mail pile.LOUISThis came for you today.

The package is from Columbia University. Allen opens it,
mystified as to what it might be.

It's his manuscript.

On it, a note: "Walt Jr.: Keep this, Keep Going. - Professor
Steeves."

The music on the radio suddenly stops for a news broadcast.RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)This is Bill O'Connell reporting
          from Paris and these are the sounds
          of liberation.

Over the radio comes the sound of a ROARING CELEBRATION.RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)Crowds have assembled in the
          streets.

Allen takes in the historic news. He looks at his father. The
world, forever changed.RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)This is the end of a long darkness.
          France and Europe are finally free.

to play.EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - DAYSun streaming on Allen, standing at the bank of the Hudson
River, at the place where David died.ALLEN (V.O.)Another lover hits the universe.

pastoral, shimmering. Strolling couples, families walk by.

Yorkers of all kinds, pouring champagne, toasting the end of
the Second World War.ALLEN (V.O.)But with death comes rebirth.

The camera searches through the crowd to find Allen smoking
in a banquette towards the rear of the bar, dressed-down,
scruffy - a hint of the man he will soon become.

He is joyous, writing in his journal.ALLEN (V.O.)And like all lovers and sad people

The camera then pans past Allen, up and across the old
college photos on the wall.

We find a framed newspaper article on the Columbia's football
team's latest victory.

In the corner of the article, we see a familiar face.

As we move closer, we can read the edge of the headline
reads: "HONOR SLAYING."

The face belongs to Lucien Carr, staring down, frozen in
time.
