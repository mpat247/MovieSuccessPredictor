LITTLE ATHENSWritten byJeff Zuber & Tom ZuberDraft: 3/17/04FADE IN:INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- MORNINGThe room is dark and messy. JERRY, a soft, unshaven boy of about
          eighteen years, sits on the end of his bed in boxers and an old t-
          shirt. He has not quite woken up yet.Jerry pulls a huge, well-traveled SUITCASE from his closet and
          tosses it onto the bed. He begins grabbing articles of CLOTHING
          from the closet and tossing them into the Suitcase.INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATERJerry is in his kitchen, which is no brighter than his bedroom, and
          not much cleaner. Jerry takes another bite of his peanut butter and
          jelly SANDWICH. He chews mechanically, washing it down with a can
          of SODA. His lazy mind is somewhere else.INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATERJerry gargles with a generic brand of MOUTHWASH and spits into the
          sink.He catches a glimpse of himself in the medicine cabinet mirror - he
          is not very attractive. He grabs his TOOTHBRUSH and RAZOR, and
          exits the bathroom.INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATERThe room has been stripped except for the bed minus its bedsheets, a
          naked pillow, a beat-up dresser with a small TV on top of it, an old
          POGO STICK propped against the wall near the GARBAGE CAN at the foot
          of the bed, and a few posters and scraps of trash. Jerry tosses his
          Toothbrush and Razor into his Suitcase next to a VIDEO GAME CONSOLE
          and several VIDEO GAMES, on top of which lies GRAND THEFT AUTO III.
          He has pitifully few belongings. He shuts the Suitcase.INT. JERRY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATERThe living room is also a mess - the place is either a pig sty or a
          house full of bachelors. Jerry, now in sweatpants and sneakers, but
          still wearing the same t-shirt that he slept in, carries his
          Suitcase through the foyer to the front door. He about-faces to
          look at the interior of his home. He will not miss it.He turns to open the screen door - it's stuck. He fiddles with
          handle until the screen door opens. He exits, letting the screen
          door slam shut behind him.TITLE CARD:Little Athens2EXT. RESCUE SQUAD -- MORNINGThe old building is badly in need of a fresh paint job.   A faded
          sign reading "ATHENS RESCUE SQUAD" stands in front.HEATHER (O.S.)You hear about your ex?ALLISON (O.S.)Jerry?INT. RESCUE SQUAD, KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUSThe kitchen is empty except for HEATHER and ALLISON, both about
          nineteen and dressed in EMS uniforms with "EMS" stitched
          conspicuously on the back, seated on opposite sides of a wooden
          table. Heather is dark-haired, about 5'9" and built like a lingerie
          model. Allison has blond hair, is several inches shorter than
          Heather, and although not overweight, she has a softer build than
          Heather. Heather has take-out PANCAKES and SAUSAGES in front of
          her, and she is putting it away like she is preparing for famine.
          Allison has a BAGEL and a PEACH, which remain hardly touched - she
          has a lot on her mind.HEATHERYeah, asshole Jerry. He's moving to
                    Middletown. He left this morning.ALLISONNo way.   How do you know?HEATHERCarter said. He got some job at some
                    company, giving his uncle hand-jobs.Having put away the last of her food, Heather lights a CIGARETTE and
          stands near the open window, careful to blow the smoke out the
          window.ALLISONDoesn't sound so bad.HEATHERI got us tickets to see Adam tomorrow.ALLISONI don't want to go to a baseball game.
                    You're going with Derek anyway.HEATHERAlly, I don't want to go either, but Derek
                    told Adam he'd go, and I'm not going by
                    myself.3ALLISONI thought Adam was hurt.HEATHERI wish.Heather takes a drag of her Cigarette and exhales out the window.EXT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT -- MORNINGBRAD, in jeans with his t-shirt thrown over his shoulder, is
          standing in front of the door, waiting. MEGAN, in shorts, a t-shirt
          and a baseball cap, and AMY, in a sunskirt, look on. All in their
          late teens, they are unmade and worn-out, as if they hadn't slept
          last night.Brad rings the doorbell twice and waits some more. Brad walks over
          to the window a few feet over from the door, trying to peer through
          the shades. Megan passes the time by pulling Jimmy's MAIL out of
          the mailbox that hangs next to the door.BRAD(banging on the window
                         pane)
                    Hey! Jimmy!The door opens and JIMMY answers, in his very late teens, about 5'4"
          and thin, dressed in boxers, a t-shirt and bedroom slippers.
          Jimmy's tired, but Brad's a friendly face.BRAD (CONT'D)Finally!JIMMYOffice hours are nine to five.MEGANYou have a lot of credit card bills in
                    there, Jimmy.JIMMY(holding his hand out for
                         the Mail)
                    I know.Megan hands Jimmy the Mail.MEGANYou're not mad that we're stopping by like
                    this?JIMMYIt's no big deal, but let's hurry up.    I
                    gotta go to work.4MEGAN(explaining to Amy)
                    Jimmy's got like, six jobs.Jimmy stands aside, allowing Megan and Amy into his apartment.
          Megan and Amy step inside, but Brad holds back. He needs to talk to
          Jimmy, and the girls do not need to hear.BRADHey Jimmy, hold up a sec. Look, not for
                    nothin', but you know Buggerin' Bobby
                    Bales is askin' about you?JIMMYAskin'?   Like how?BRADLike how you owe him money on the Dallas
                    fiasco, those chokin' motherfuckers, and
                    you haven't been returnin' his calls.JIMMYHow you hear this?BRADYesterday. I was puttin' a twenty-timer
                    on Indiana for tonight, and he up and out-
                    of-the-blue asks about you. Jimmy, man.
                    Goddam.JIMMY(unconvincing)
                    It ain't nothin'. He's just makin'
                    conversation.BRADIt ain't nothin'? That faggot juicehead's
                    gonna make a playground outta your asshole
                    like he's back in the joint, and it ain't
                    nothin'? And you heard all the stories I
                    heard, about that horse-cock, and how he
                    can't stop shootin' his mouth off about it
                    too, like when he whipped it out at
                    Tomlinson's party...JIMMYAlright Brad! Christ Jesus, I owe a
                    little, shit, but I'll pay. Believe me,
                    that guy wants his juice, his e, he comes
                    to me. It's fine.BRADPut some cash on Indy tonight, Jimmy.5JIMMYYeah. Alright, come inside and let's do
                    this thing. I got work.Brad steps past Jimmy into the apartment, and Jimmy shuts the door
          after them.EXT. POOL -- MORNINGThe slender white board extends majestically over the glistening
          blue water. PEDRO, an unshowered, pot-bellied Hispanic, about
          twenty-three years of age and wearing cut-off jean shorts, is
          standing at the end of the board, looking down at the water below as
          if expecting an invitation. COREY, a late teenager covered with
          tattoos, with twigs for arms and legs, lies against the hard
          concrete while inserting the pool VACUUM HOSE into one of the many
          pool skimmer drains. Pedro begins to bounce on the board - up,
          down, up, down. Pedro launches forth as if the water called out to
          him and, but for his want of grace, the entry would be poetic.
          Instead, Pedro's dive is as clumsy as it is painful.COREYNice.PEDROFuck you, conjo. This is my shower.COREYMaybe back in Mexico that's a shower, in
                    Athens that's just dirty.PEDROClean the pool, conjo, clean the pool.COREYAt least I'm paid to be here.Pedro smiles as he paddles away from Corey, starting to enjoy his
          morning swim. A PAYPHONE hanging on the pool house starts ringing.
          Corey drops the Vacuum and runs toward the Payphone. In the
          background a number of enormous sand filters groan loudly.COREY (CONT'D)Wynwood Pool House, Corey speaking.EMILY, the voice on the other end, is hushed and uncertain.EMILY'S VOICEIt's me.COREYEmily?EMILY'S VOICESome other girl would be calling you?6COREYHow'd you get this number?EMILY'S VOICEDon't you work there?COREYWhat do you want?EMILY'S VOICEI need you to come pick me up.COREYAre you kidding? Where are you?EMILY'S VOICEAt home.COREYWhat for?EMILY'S VOICEJust because. I need to stay with you for
                    a couple days.COREYEmily, our place is tiny, we got no water.
                    Our phone just got shut off, too. You'd
                    be miserable like us. What for anyway?EMILY'S VOICEIt's no big deal. Just come pick me up.COREYFine, forget it then.EMILY'S VOICECorey, come on! How many times have I
                    called you since you left? I wouldn't
                    ask, except I don't have anywhere to go.
                    Please.COREYFine. Alright, fine. If you wanna stay
                    in our little dump, fine.EMILY'S VOICEFine.   Thanks, then.INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT -- MORNINGJESSICA, about eighteen, wire-thin and plain, yet attractive in an
          unkept sort of way, with dirty-blond hair past her shoulders, lies
          on a couch sleeping. Her chokingly small living room is in a7devastating state of disarray, with clothes and empty food
          containers flung in every direction.An ALARM on a table next to the couch begins blaring, and Jessica
          stretches out her arm to silence it.INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATERJessica is standing in front of the mirror staring at herself, still
          half asleep. The bathroom is tiny like the living room - pathetic
          rather than endearing. She puts TOOTHPASTE on her TOOTHBRUSH.INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUSJINA, Jessica's mother, opens the front door and enters the living
          room wearing a grocery checkout clerk's uniform. Jina drops her
          old, worn out purse onto the coffee table and enters the hallway.
          She opens the bathroom door and enters.INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUSJessica is brushing her teeth when Jina enters.JINAAren't you supposed to be watching Katie
                    right now?Jina reaches around Jessica and opens the medicine cabinet, grabs a
          bottle of ASPIRIN, and shuts it. Jessica continues brushing as if
          her mother were not there.JINA (CONT'D)Did you get my message?Jessica shakes her head in the negative sense. Jina exits the
          bathroom and Jessica follows, still brushing her teeth.INT. JESSICA'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUSJessica walks over to the ANSWERING MACHINE and hits a button. The
          Answering Machine clicks on as Jessica brushes unenthusiastically.ANSWERING MACHINE(electronic voice)
                    You have one new message.
                         (Jina's voice)
                    Hi Jess, it's your mother, calling to say
                    happy birthday, since you'll be gone when
                    I get home. I'm driving your sister to
                    school and I'm leaving the car for her, so
                    I'll be taking the train back.Jessica starts up as if she'd been struck. She spins around to an
          open window near the couch, leans out, and spits out the toothpaste8to the concrete sidewalk below. Her mother's voice continues to
          pour forth from the Answering Machine.ANSWERING MACHINE (CONT'D)By the way, you should call your sister
                    and stop this not-talking nonsense.Jessica finishes spitting the suds from her mouth and spins back
          towards the Answering Machine.ANSWERING MACHINE (CONT'D)Anyway, I know how you hate long messages,
                    so I'll see you tomorrow...Suddenly wide awake, Jessica turns to her mother.JESSICAThat's fucking bullshit.JINAHere we go again.JESSICAWhat about my car?!JINAJessica, your sister got into beauty
                    school, and she's going. Now I've got
                    about two hours sleep before I have to
                    drive her all the way the hell up there.JESSICAYeah, I heard that.JINAJess, you're still living here for free.JESSICAOn the couch!JINAJessica, it's still my car, and she needs
                    it. Can't you be happy for your sister?JESSICAOh yeah, I'm real happy. She gets my car,
                    and I get shit. Thanks, Jina. Do me a
                    favor and tell her how fucking happy I am
                    for her.JINAIf you're going to be like this, I'm just
                    going to bed.9Jessica storms back into the bathroom and rinses her mouth out with
          water.Jessica returns to the living room wearing a t-shirt that reads
          "Athens Youth Group" in large letters along the front. Jina is
          gone. Jessica runs her hand through her hair, tossing it
          haphazardly. She grabs a pair of large SUNGLASSES off of the coffee
          table and places them over her eyes.She opens the door and exits the apartment.EXT. RON'S GYM -- MORNINGJimmy's PIECE-OF-SHIT hatchback is parked in front of the small
          bare-bones gym.INT. RON'S GYM, LOCKER ROOM -- CONTINUOUSJimmy now dressed in worn-out heavily-frayed khaki shorts and a
          short-sleeve button down shirt with a "Ron's Gym" emblem on the
          pocket, stands before his locker twisting the combination lock with
          one hand while rotating steel CHINESE STRESS BALLS with his other
          hand. He opens the locker and pulls out a large brown LUNCH BAG
          propped prominently at the base.RON (O.S.)Hey Jimmy.   You fix the lat machine?RON, the tall, well-built, forty-something owner of the gym,
          approaches. Jimmy turns toward Ron. The row of lockers serves as a
          backdrop.JIMMYYeah.RONJimmy, I'm just gonna say this, alright?
                    I gotta let you go. I can't afford two
                    employees.JIMMYSo you're keeping Melinda?RONYeah.JIMMYRon, that is totally fucked!   I been here
                    way longer than her!RONYeah, but I'm running a business.
                    There're guys who pay me dues just 'cause
                    she works here.10JIMMYBut she doesn't do anything! She just
                    sits at the front desk all day.RONI know that.JIMMYTell her to fix the fucking lat machine,
                    she'll look at you cross-eyed.RONI can't afford two employees, and she
                    attracts business. That's it.JIMMYFucking great. Thanks.RONJimmy, don't take it personal. If you
                    were built like her I'd keep you.Ron exits and Jimmy sits on the bench in front of his locker,
          defeated. BUGGERIN' BOBBY BALES, a.k.a. Bobby the Bookie, an
          enormous juicehead built like an old-school NFL linebacker, naked
          except for a towel around his neck, having just taken a shower, is
          leaning against the end of a row of lockers, waiting for his chance
          at Jimmy. Jimmy would rather that Ron stay.RON (CONT'D)Bales.Bobby nods in response as Ron passes by on his way out. With the
          locker room empty, Bobby unconsciously changes demeanor. He's
          tender, frighteningly tender, it's so entirely genuine. Jimmy would
          prefer a beating - simple and final. Jimmy pulls his BACKPACK out
          of his locker and begins clearing his STUFF.BOBBYSo where you been?JIMMYWhat are you talkin' about?   Nowhere.   I
                    been working.BOBBYSo you just don't return my phone calls.JIMMYLook, they lost, I owe you some more, so
                    what? I'll pay you. I want to put it on
                    Indy tonight.11BOBBYI can't take any more of your bets.   I
                    look like a spineless fucking fag.Bobby shuts Jimmy's locker and steps up to Jimmy so that Jimmy is
          now face to face with Bobby's enormous organ - a terrifying sight
          for mortal men and reputable women. Jimmy is struck silent,
          savagely clenching his Chinese Stress Balls as he struggles for
          thought.BOBBY (CONT'D)What the hell am I supposed to do with you
                    Jimmy? People are talkin'.JIMMYI know they're talkin'!BOBBYYou don't know a fuckin' thing. Come by
                    my apartment tonight, we'll figure this
                    out.JIMMYI ain't like that.BOBBYAin't like what?JIMMYNothin'.BOBBYYou don't know what I know.   You'll see.JIMMYI'm working tonight.BOBBYJimmy, I ain't about beggin'. I'm lookin'
                    like a fool all on account 'a you. You
                    owe me. You owe me. I'm gettin' sick of
                    it.Bobby moves on to his own locker.EXT. POOL -- CONTINUOUSWIDE across the width of the pool. COREY, wet, with GOGGLES on his
          head, holding a WRENCH and SCREW DRIVER, and BYSTANDER #1, stand
          over a young twenty-ish female VICTIM who lies passed out on the
          cement. A young female LIFEGUARD is kneeling beside the Victim,
          checking her pulse and breathing. The two SWIMMERS left in the pool
          are climbing out. PETE, a no-nonsense grounds-keeper in his late
          thirties, wearing cut-off shorts, a faded t-shirt and a tool belt,
          approaches to have a word with Corey.12PETEIs she alright?COREYShe fainted.LIFEGUARDAlright, I'm calling 911.    Everybody stay
                    out of the pool.The Lifeguard stands and runs off toward the PAYPHONE.PETEAlright, well, quit horsing around. The
                    Blandino's had a break-in. There's glass
                    all over the patio.COREYThat's Jerry's unit.PETEJerry moved to Middletown.COREYHe quit?PETEHe left a message. You gotta take care of
                    all his stuff now, too.COREYAw, come on, Pete! I need off tomorrow!
                    I told you I got community service!PETESo you're gonna have to get everything
                    done today then. Get going.Corey tears the Goggles off his head, throws them into the pool, and
          about-faces toward the pool-house. As Corey leaves, a RED-HEADED
          IDIOT does a sloppy can-opener off the side of the pool.LIFEGUARD (O.S.)Keith, I told you to clear the pool!EXT. EMPTY PARK -- MORNINGThough the park is in a poor neighborhood, it is relatively clean.
          The park is quiet and unused this morning except for two young GIRLS
          making their way across it. Prominent in the background sits an old
          run-down yellow CAR that Jessica drove to the park.13JESSICA is carrying KATIE, a plain, tiny seven-year-old girl, in
          piggy-back fashion, with Katie's legs dangling out in front of
          Jessica. Katie holds Jessica tight around the collarbone.KATIEDoesn't Carlos want his car back?JESSICAHe's letting me borrow it.KATIEWell then why were you late if you had his
                    car?JESSICAI slept late.KATIEWere you drinking last night?JESSICANo.   But thanks for asking.KATIEWere you doing drugs?JESSICAKatie, I told you, drugs are for losers.KATIEAnd you're not a loser.JESSICAAnd neither are you.KATIEBut it's okay to drink.JESSICAWhen you're older it'll be okay.KATIEHow old are you?JESSICAOld enough.KATIEBut you're not twenty-one yet. The law
                    says you have to be twenty-one.JESSICAKatie, can you not ask so many questions
                    today? I've got too much to think about.14KATIECause it's your birthday?JESSICAYes.KATIEHappy Birthday!JESSICAThank you.Jessica begins walking faster, soon breaking into a crippled run,
          the weight of Katie bearing down on her. They reach their
          destination - a rickety old merry-go-round. Jessica turns her back
          to the merry-go-round, allowing Katie to step onto it.JESSICA (CONT'D)Hold on tight or you'll get hurt.KATIEI will.Katie grabs a handle as Jessica begins to spin the machine. Katie
          sails around happily as Jessica steps back to watch, Katie's
          youthful enthusiasm lulling Jessica into a nostalgic gloom.INT. AMBULANCE -- MORNINGHEATHER is driving the AMBULANCE, sirens blaring, a CIGARETTE
          hanging out of her mouth, with ALLISON riding shotgun. HARRY, mild-
          mannered, rotund, middle-aged and slightly balding, is in the back
          sitting on a bench extending from the side of the ambulance,
          adjacent to a stretcher. Harry sits expressionless, adjusting his
          spectacles as the ambulance shakes mildly from the driving.ALLISON(pointing)
                    Turn left at the light.EXT. ROAD -- CONTINUOUSWIDE on the ambulance tearing through town, lights flashing.
          Heather is driving extremely fast in this emergency situation,
          recklessly passing both moving vehicles as well as stationary
          vehicles that have stopped to let the ambulance pass, on her way to
          running through a red light. In the rear of the ambulance, Harry
          whips back and forth on the bench, yet remains calm, as if unaware
          of Heather's reckless driving.EXT. POOL, PARKING LOT -- CONTINUOUSWithin the parking lot, the ambulance comes to a screeching halt in
          front of a large picket fence encircling the pool. At the gate
          stands the LIFEGUARD.15All three climb out of the ambulance.    Harry rushes toward the
          Lifeguard. Heather takes a final puff    of her Cigarette and flicks
          it aside before continuing in the same   direction as Harry. Allison
          lags behind, pulling a BACKBOARD and a   large FIRST AID KIT out of
          the ambulance.LIFEGUARDShe's in here.They enter the gate.EXT. POOL -- CONTINUOUSHeather and Harry follow the Lifeguard into the pool area, where
          several BYSTANDERS have gathered around the VICTIM, BYSTANDER #1 and
          PETE among them. Heather gets to the Victim first, but stops short
          - she recognizes the Victim. Harry brushes past Heather.HARRY(to Bystanders)
                    Can you give us some room, please?The crowd backs up a bit, and Harry checks for vitals.HARRY (CONT'D)(looking up to Heather)

                    What happened?LIFEGUARDI'm not sure. She just passed out, right
                    where you see her.HARRYDid you see her eat anything?LIFEGUARDUh-uh.Heather turns and walks back toward Allison coming through the gate
          carrying the Backboard and First Aid Kit - she wants a word with
          Allison. They talk in hushed tones.HEATHERI know her.ALLISONYeah?    How?16Allison hands Heather the First Aid Kit as they move back toward
          Harry.HEATHERWhen I was dating Steve, that slut fucked
                    him.ALLISONHow do you know?HEATHERShe started dating Steve right after we
                    broke up. I mean right after. I asked
                    him if there was another girl, and he
                    never answered. He couldn't answer,
                    because he was fucking that slut.ALLISONThat doesn't mean they fucked.Heather gives Allison a disapproving look, as if to say "don't be
          stupid, stupid."As Heather and Allison approach the Victim, Harry looks up.HARRYAlright, she ain't comin' around.Allison lays the Backboard adjacent to the Victim, and the three
          place her on the Backboard. Heather is a bit rough.HARRY (CONT'D)(instinctively)
                    Whoa, easy.HEATHER(without looking up)
                    I know what I'm doing.Harry gives a concerned look to Allison, who returns the look, but
          the two say nothing. They place the Victim into the back of the
          Ambulance as Heather looks on.EXT. ROAD -- MOMENTS LATERThe Ambulance is moving along a near-empty single-lane road at a
          patient pace, with two CARS tailgating behind it.INT. AMBULANCE -- CONTINUOUSAllison and Harry are in the back with the Victim, and Heather is
          again behind the wheel, moving her head ever so slightly, as if to
          music playing in her head. Heather's moderate driving speed is in
          sharp contrast to the speed with which she responded to the scene.
          At the same red light that Heather recklessly ran earlier, Heather17stops and looks in all directions before proceeding, even though
          there are no cars at the intersection.HARRYUh, Heather, you want to step on it?HEATHERWe'll get there.ALLISONYou don't even know for sure if she slept
                    with Steve!Heather turns around in the driver seat, taking her eyes off the
          road.HEATHERListen, fuck that slut, okay?! She can

          it hits a pothole.EXT. COREY AND PEDRO'S HOUSE -- MORNINGThe Tow Truck has just pulled up into the driveway. Pedro climbs
          out and makes his way up the sidewalk to his front door, carrying a
          gallon of MILK. Emily climbs out and trails behind him, carrying
          her LAUNDRY BAG and PURSE. The house is very small, with a front
          yard that is not much bigger than the sidewalk, and neighboring
          houses not much more than a body length apart from each other.
          Pedro notices an EVICTION NOTICE on the front door, and that a
          brand-new lock has been placed on the otherwise run-down door. He
          tries unsuccessfully to open the door.He walks over and looks through the front window into his kitchen
          and sees his DOG. Pedro taps on the window. The Dog looks up at
          Pedro, wagging its tail. Pedro tries to open the window, but it's
          locked.Pedro walks around to the side of the house. Emily throws her
          Laundry Bag over her shoulder and follows him, frustrated with the
          wait. He looks in the window on the pantry door. He backs up and18looks toward Emily, blank. He looks back up at the house,
          frustrated. He about-faces, steps over to the side of the
          neighboring house, unzips his pants, looks both ways to make sure
          the neighbors are not around, and starts pissing. Emily shakes her
          head and heads back toward the truck, turned off by the whole
          situation.EXT. PIZZA SHOP -- MORNINGJimmy parks his PIECE-OF-SHIT in front of a mom-and-pop pizza shop

          the pile on the passenger seat.He closes the door, and pulls a DELIVERY LIST out of his pocket to

                    you!INT. MATT'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUSMATT, in his late teens, has a very short buzz-cut. He's wearing an
          old t-shirt and faded cargo-shorts, and he's sitting up on the edge
          of his unmade bed. Matt's bedroom is a shithole, with dirty clothes
          piled everywhere. He's talking into a CORDLESS PHONE, using his
          free hand to rub the back of his neck nervously.MATT(semi-whispering)

          begins ringing again. Jimmy reverses himself and begins rolling the
          window back up.JIMMY (CONT'D)Yeah, it's Jimmy!We cut back and forth between Jimmy and Matt. Matt is now pacing
          back and forth in his shithole room. His voice is hushed, although
          the sense of urgency in it is obvious. Jimmy's still talking loud,
          as his Piece-of-Shit does not provide a quiet ride.MATTJimmy! Jesus, man! Listen to me! I need

          The DRIVER of the forward Car stirs.INT. JIMMY'S CAR -- CONTINUOUSJimmy has his right arm draped over the Pizza Boxes in the passenger
          seat, protecting them from flying forward as a parent would have
          instinctively reached to hold back a child. His Cell Phone starts
          ringing again. He slowly begins to stir.EXT. TRAFFIC INTERSECTION -- CONTINUOUSThe driver, DAVE, a large, ripped, soft-spoken juicehead, gets out
          of the forward car holding the back of his neck. He slams the door
          shut with his free hand, pissed, and staggers towards Jimmy's car.
          A twenty-something FEMALE PASSENGER is sitting motionless in the
          passenger seat. Dave glances up and sees Jimmy.DAVEJimmy?

          hair above his lip and on his chin. AARON, a burly mutt, about the

          one of the thigh pockets ripped off, a sleeveless shirt and a tattoo

          of the car, cutting his own arm while doing so. Aaron growls, more
          in anger than pain, as he yanks with all his might. Jessica is
          holding onto the inside of the passenger door with one hand, and is
          scratching and clawing at Aaron to get Aaron to release her with her
          other hand. Jessica's seat belt clearly is the only thing keeping
          her in the car. Carlos is pulling away slowly. Aaron releases one
          hand from Jessica's hair and punches at the top of her head.JESSICA (CONT'D)Fuck you!AARONFuck you, you filthy fuckin' whore!Aaron repeatedly tries to hit Jessica with his free hand as Carlos
          pulls into the street. Aaron runs along with the car. Jessica
          reaches toward Aaron with a closed fist, where she is holding her
          PEPPER SPRAY. She sprays at Aaron but misses. Aaron grabs at her
          fist with his free hand and rips the Pepper Spray from Jessica.

          side of the road. Aaron is plowed along toward the Car, but
          releases Jessica at the last possible second, just avoiding a
          collision with the Car. Carlos was not fooling around.Aaron watches them tear down the street before he about-faces and

          down the street from where Pedro has parked, but on the opposite
          side of the street and facing in the opposite direction. Through
          the windshield, we see Berubi head back toward the house as Pedro
          glances at Jessica, now showered and dressed in a yellow tank-top,
          before climbing back into the Tow Truck and pulling back out onto

          the back porch, walking its length toward Carter, who is kneeling
          with his back to us as he puts a TAP on the KEG. Carlos stands
          watching, not sure what to do.JESSICA (CONT'D)What're you doing?Carter turns around, and seems disappointed to see her.JESSICA (CONT'D)You need a hand?CARTERI'm done.Carter climbs to his feet and heads toward the back door, shaking

          passionately kissing each other against a tree in the back yard. We
          hang on the couple as Emily walks out of frame. As the boy works

          catch someone watching her.JIMMY is standing in the kitchen in front of the door looking out
          onto the back porch, staring at the couple making out, momentarily
          transfixed. Jimmy's hand is in his pocket, turning his CHINESE
          STRESS BALLS over and over and over. The girl closes her eyes

          the entrance to the living room. The terribly familiar figure,
          BUGGERIN' BOBBY BALES, stands tall, proud, talking to several
          Partygoers, the light behind him adding a regal air to his menacing
          frame - a transcendent silhouette for a hellish vision. Bobby
          towers easily over his peers. In his powerful hands he holds a tiny
          notepad on which he scribbles as his clients eagerly place their
          bets.RJ, a young African-American early-twenty-something, easily six feet

          continues to stare at Jessica, clearly taken by the sight of her,
          his eyes locking onto hers. The desperation of their individual
          struggles is lost for a moment.PEDROYou want me to talk to her?The moment quickly passes as Corey turns his attention back to

          SINJIN, a young African-American male about RJ's age, with an
          average build, sharply dressed in a button-down, and sport coat.
          Sinjin has his back to Jimmy, and is bouncing up and down on a rusty
          old POGO STICK - his behavior constituting a sharp contrast to his
          stylish threads. LOUIE, an overweight, slobbish Caucasian male a
          few years older than Sinjin, sits in a rickety old WHEELCHAIR that
          might creak even more than Sinjin's pogo stick - in Louie's lap
          rests a BOWLING BALL BAG. Upon seeing Sinjin and Louie, Jimmy
          fondles his WATER BOTTLE nervously. He turns around to watch RJ
          closing the door behind them.LOUIESinjin!Sinjin spins on the Pogo Stick and spots RJ and Jimmy standing at
          the entrance. Sinjin loses his balance and places a foot on the

          the word "what?" Allison continues whispering, and Heather's face
          becomes furious. She pushes Allison back.HEATHER (CONT'D)You fucking slut!Heather shoves Allison hard off the couch. As Allison stumbles

          on all fours employing the turtle defense. We catch a glimpse of
          Allison's face - she is in utter panic. Heather's foot catches
          Allison square in the face, knocking her limp.107Most of the crowd has stopped cheering. Heather continues to kick
          at Allison's limp body, and two SKINNY GUYS pull Heather away.

          BAT. She shuts the trunk and looks over to the house.AARON walks through Carter's front door and steps onto the porch,

          moves toward Jessica very quickly, but a look at the bat Jessica is
