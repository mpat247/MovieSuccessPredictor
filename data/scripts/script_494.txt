          Morning.

          Clouds moving through the sky.

          We see various shots of the city, exterior storefronts,
          people going about their lives and some wider shots of the
          city.

          As they continue, the hour gets progressively later in the
          day until the final sequence which takes place at night.
          Over this we hear our guy, PATRICK (30).PATRICK (V. 0 . )To people who grow up here, this city is
                     like family. The thing about family,
                     about the city, about the church, about
                     the people you grow up with-- is that no
                     matter how much they hurt you, no matter
                     what the cost is, you still love them.

                     And despite all our flaws-- what we do to
                     each other-- what is done to us-- I've
                     always felt proprietary about it all.

                     Like the old commercial for dog food:
                     'doesn't your dog deserve to be treated
                     like a member of the family?' I've always
                     believed it depended on the dog. Beyond
                     that, the most I thought about anything
                     was what I wanted to do. Who I wanted to
                     be. To rise where my father said I
                     couldn't go, to succeed. To be a man.EXT. MCCREADY THREE DECKER       NIGHT-A playground at night, completely empty. One of the swings

          the cottage. He carries 2 FULL SUITCASES to a SUBURBAN and
          loads them in the back. His wife, FRANCINE, follows.

                       see she has been crying.
                       This isn't what Patrick expected and he is taken aback for a

          kidnapped, my aunt hired you to find me,
          and you did. You found me with a strange

                    was raised as a stranger to myself and

          facing him, arms around his shoulders, head tucked   into his
          neck. He slowly rocks the chair. He holds Amanda     like its
          the last hug of his life. His eyes are fixed on a    point

          strange and cute stuffed snake, and Francine's bag spilling
          over with zip-locked snacks and children's cups-- all the
          stuff Francine had packed to make sure Amanda would have,
          whereever she'd go.
          Over this all, beginning faintly and growing increasingly
          audible, is the inanity of the television news. It's blather

          sad.
          A swarm of West Beckett POLICE CRUISERS cram the small road.

          easy for them.

          Patrick stands just inside the front door watching her.HELENE (0. . )SI'm sorry for being rude' but I gotta be
                       outta here in like two minutes.

                         
          Patrick doesn't answer' his gaze fixed on Amanda. She finally
          looks up at him. Patrick SMILES at her.PATRICKHi.

                         
          Amanda looks at him' blankly.
          She returns her attention to the TV.HELENE (0.. )SYou think hef11 like me?
          Patrick looks over to Helene standing in the doorwayf all
          dolled up -- striking a pose. She wears too much makeup. Her
          clothes reveal too much of what she hasn't got.PATRICKWho?HELENEMy date.PATRICKI'm sure he will.HELENEAww' you' re sweet. He seen me on my
                       American Victim and he wrote me letters
                       and I was like whatever' but then he saw
                       my Katie Couric and drove down here from
                       Providence so I was likef that's
                       romantic' right?
          Patrick forces a smile.HELENE (CONT'D)Howrs your girlfriend?PATRICK(HESITATES)She's all right. She's up the north shore
                    with her sister.HELENE( FLIRTY)If she donrt get smart' I'll take you
                    out.

                    Hope she got better family than I do'
                    right?

                         
          Patrick forces a nod. She fastens an earring to her lobe.PATRICKHowfs Bea?HELENEI wouldn't let her in the apartment.(JUSTIFYING)Whatr I want to lose her again? Forget
                    it.(BEAT)She sold her unit. Moved out to fancy
                    pants in Melrose. Good riddance.PATRICKYeah.HELENEDon' t think she didnft hate you for
                    Lionel goinr to jail.PATRICKProbably why she never paid my bill.HELENEYou should fuckin' sue.

                         
          Something registers on Amanda's face when Helene says "fuck.''PATRICKHow about youf Helene? You hate me?HELENEEuck no. Brother or not he took my kid.
                    Euck him. She could' a been hurt.PATRICKWhat about Amanda?HELENEWhat about Amanda?PATRICKWho's watching her?HELENEDottie.PATRICKDottie know that?HELENEShe will in five minutes.(GIGGLES)Shit, I'm gonna be late, too.

          Patrick looks to Amanda. She just sits there. Watches TV.HELENE (CONT'D)(LEAVING)You' re a godsend, Patrick.

                         
          She goes. And then calls out from the stairwell.HELENE (O.S.) (CONT'D)BYE!! !Patrick sits next to Amanda on the couch . . . And together --
          silently -- they watch TV.
           Patrick sees that Amanda is holding her famous doll, the one
          the papers said she loved so much, the one Angie plucked from
          the quarry..PATRICK(RE: DOLL)Is that Mirabelle?
          Amanda looks up at him.AMANDA(CORRECTING)Annabelle.
          He nods. It makes sense. They turn back to the television.PATRICK (V.0. )I started going to Church again. I saw
                     them bury Remy and, for the first time in
                     years, maybe ever, I prayed for someone.
                     I did everything I wanted to do. I proved
                     my father wrong. I either learned my
                     lesson or became a man, I can't tell the
                     difference . Either way, all it' s left me
                     is the hollow, copper aftertaste in my
                     throat, like a vague and distant regret.
                     Remy was right, I know very little--but
                     what I do know, I am sure of: I was wrong
                     about that commercial. "Shouldn' t your
                     dog be treated like a member of the
                     family?" It doesn't depend on the dog. It
                     depends on the family.
          We hold on them for an extended beat. The blather from the
          television washes over them, the man and the little girl.FADE TO BLACKThe End.
