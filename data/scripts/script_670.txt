     alone, we can feel he's not alone.

     He looks left, right... then... four snakes, swimming, hovering,

     the odd school of fish, an otter, a snapping turtle... nothing
     extraordinary.  Then, a flash shadow looms over him.  He looks
     up, but sees nothing.  Probably just the sun ducking under a
     cloud.  It does make him sufficiently nervous, however, to head
     for the surface.  He swims upward.EXT. LAKE (SURFACE) - CONTINUOUSHector breaks the top.  Lifts his mask, looks toward the
     chopper, which he sees about forty yards out.  He continues to
     breaststroke on the surface.  Suddenly... the croc's head rises
     up right behind Hector, who's oblivious.  He continues to swim.
     The croc follows.  Then... maybe divine intuition... Hector gets
     a feeling he's being followed.  He then turns to look the other
     way, upon which his face goes rigid.HIS P.O.V.About three feet from his nose... are two giant eyes staring at

               Back the truck--ALLNo!!!JACKHector, you see anything?ANGLE HECTORon the pontoon of his chopper.  He's looking about, studying the
     water.HECTORNo!KEOUGH(sarcastic)
               I just have this feeling
               everything's totally safe.HECTOR(yelling)
               I see blood.  Maybe you got him,
               Hank.

     And as Hector looks further.  Behind him... up surfaces the
     crocodile in all his stealth.  His head is two feet from Hector
     and nobody knows it.  Least of all Hector.HECTOR (CONT'D)I can't see him, but this is
               definitely blood.  Maybe you got
               him.

     And as he turns back, he sees it.  The croc comes up as Hector
     screams, jumps off.  Screams.  Keough leaps off the truck and
     charges into the shallow water with his gun, looking to give
     Hector some cover.

     Hector then resurfaces swimming to his bobbing chopper.  He
     climbs in.KEOUGHWhere is he?!HECTORI don't know!

     No sooner said than the croc comes launching up.  As he springs
     toward the open chopper cabin, Hector, leaps out on the other
     side.  The croc's head comes crashing clear through the cabin
     and he becomes wedged.  The crocodile is stuck, he protrudes
     right through the chopper.  He's not completely immobilized but
     wherever he goes now, the helicopter is going with him.KEOUGHHector!!

     But now Jack has joined, rifle in hand.  Hector surfaces again,
     swimming for shore.  Jack runs to help him onto land.KEOUGH (CONT'D)(taking aim)
               Alright.  Game over.

     But the croc looks feeble now.  He lets out this MOAN of DEATH.
     And even Keough hesitates to pull the trigger.KEOUGH (CONT'D)(to Kelly)
               Should I?KELLYWait.RESUMEThe croc, unable to dive, is now thrashing toward the beach.
     But there's no rage in his behavior now.  He seems desperate.
     He's taken some bullets, he's tired, he's wedged inside a two
     ton piece of metal and he's exhausted.KELLYI think the drugs are kicking in.

     Breathing heavily, he lumbers into the shallow water, unable to
     free himself from the mangled wreckage.  As unbelievable as that
     cow looked dangling from this very chopper, the sight is even
     more astonishing, if not preposterous, now.  A thirty foot
     exhausted crocodile is wearing the broken helicopter.  And he
     just cannot go on anymore.

     Kelly, Hector, Jack, Keough, stare back.  They approach with
     caution.  They all stare at the tired crocodile.ANGLE THE CROCHe's now looking back.  Bleeding, gasping... beaten.  In his
     eyes... we can see it.  The beast is beaten.ANGLE THE PRINCIPLESThere's no triumph.  In their eyes... sadness.JACKI don't think we really want to
               wait for him to catch his breath.

     It continues to breathe heavily.KELLYHe's through fighting.  Look at
               him.JACKI don't care.  Hank.  End it.

     Keough raises his cannon.HECTORNo.  Look.  He's got nothing left.JACKYeah and every time we think
               there's no more danger--

     Upon which, a twenty footer, another croc, thrusts up out of the
     water, seizing Hector.  Screams.  It death rolls Hector, flings
     him out of his mouth and in seconds, he's coming up for more.
     Keough blasts his Avenger.  A direct hit.

     It takes the smaller croc's head right off sending it sailing
     into the air.  It splashes down, the first head not to hit
     Kelly.

     They all then go for Hector, pulling him to shore.  He's
     bleeding.HECTORI'm okay.KELLYYou're not okay, your leg's a mess.JACKGet him onto shore.KELLYHe heeds a tourniquet.

     Keough quickly peels off his shirt.  Gives it to Kelly, who goes
     to work.KELLY (CONT'D)You're gonna be okay.HECTORGuess I finally got bit.KELLYYeah, you got bit.  I'm gonna fix
               it.

     A sudden ROAR.  Kelly screams as Jack and Keough wheel to see...
     the big croc.  Maybe his final roar, he looks weak.  GASPING in
     the crashed chopper.  Jack and Keough approach.KEOUGH(quietly; re the big croc)
               He's done.  He's dying.JACKDon't count on it.
                    (then)
               We better take him out.

     But something about this crocodile... his eyes looking back at
     them... nobody wants wants to take him out.ANGLE THE CROClooking back at them.  He knows he's in their hands now.  He
     knows.ANGLE THE HUMANSA beat.HECTOR(quiet)
               Flax him under his tail.  Two
               hundred cc's.  Under the tail,
               that'll put him to sleep.

     Upon which we HEAR the SOUND of TRUCKS.  Florida Fish And Game,
     U.S. Wildlife, arriving on the scene.JACKThank God.

     OFFICER COLSON, Florida Fish And Game, emerges, approaches.
     Stares with utter disbelief.KELLYWe need to get it some medical
               help.
                    (re Hector)
               And him too.

     By now the Florida army has moved in.  They all stare with the
     same suspended disbelief.KEOUGH(explaining)
               We trapped him with our chopper.DISSOLVE TO:EXT. BEACH - AN HOUR LATERA crew, including vets, are working on the sedated croc, trying
     to free it from the wreckage.  FIND the PARAMEDICS with Hector,

               That's where they're taking the
               croc, Hector, they've got some big
               tank there.HECTORHe's gonna live?KELLYYeah.  Thanks to you.HECTORAnd Hank.

               I know you weren't really trying to
               hit him.KEOUGH(gently)
               I was aiming for you.

     Hector smiles.HECTORThanks for the rescue.

     Jack leans down.JACKYou take care.HECTORYou talk to Bickerman?JACKShe didn't tell us about the other
               croc 'cause she was afraid we'd
               blow it's head off.HECTORWomen's intuition.  Are there
               anymore?JACKJust those two.PARAMEDICWe gotta take him.JACKOkay.PARAMEDICWe got room for one.JACKWell... I got stuff to pack up
               and...

     He looks to Kelly, but before she can say "yes"--KEOUGH(grudging)
               I'll go.

     Hector smiles.  The Paramedics board Hector.  Keough turns to
     Jack.KEOUGHThanks for your help.JACKYou too.

     Handshake.  Respect.  That's about as much affection as you get
     from Keough.  He then extends his hand to Kelly.KELLYI'm sure this would offend you on
               principal but... could we keep in
               touch?KEOUGHI guess.

     And she kisses him on the cheek.  Keough fights off his blush,
     boards the chopper.  As it then lifts up, Kelly turns to Jack.KELLYWell...JACKYou wanna ride in my truck?GARE(arriving)
               Your truck is jammed.  Should we
               take some stuff out?KELLYNo, no, I'll be a while anyway.
               I'm gonna say goodbye to the lake.JACKYou sure?  I don't mind...KELLYNo, I actually want to stay for a
               little while.

     They hold a look.  Then--KELLY (CONT'D)I'll miss you most of all
               scarecrow.

     And she kisses his cheek.JACKIf I'm ever in New York...KELLYYeah.

     They hold another look.JACKY'know, if we didn't live in
               separate worlds and...

               Hey, we'll always have Maine.

     He smiles.JACKIt was... something meeting you.KELLYLikewise.

     He kisses her hand.  Holds a look.  Heads off.DISSOLVE TO:EXT. BEACH - DUSKThe tents are down, everything's packed.  A couple trucks
     remain.  The croc is gone.  Things are quiet.  Kelly stands down
     by the water, staring out.HER P.O.V.Hypnotic beauty.  The lake doesn't even ripple.  She soaks it in
     as if she knows it may be a while before she ever gets close to
     this again.  She HEARS every BIRD.  Including a DISTANT LOON.
     Serenity has returned.  Then suddenly... a stone goes skipping
     out, four, five, six skips.  Kelly turns around.  Jack stands
     there.  They hold a look.JACKI thought I should say goodbye to
               the lake too.

     He approaches.  Takes her hand.KELLY(weakly)
               Different worlds, Jack.JACKYeah, I thought about that as I was
               driving... and... I haven't found
               somebody in my world.  You found
               anyone in yours?KELLYNo.JACKSo I was thinking... maybe if I met
               anybody in my world who was good
               for you and if you know somebody in
               New York good for me, we could fix
               each other up.KELLYYou think?JACKWorth a try.  We don't wanna be
               alone forever, do we?KELLYProbably not.

     They hold a look.  He kisses her softly.JACKThat was... y'know if the guy asks
               me can she kiss, now I'll be able
               to tell him if you can.KELLYGood thinking.

     And they kiss again, this one escalates a little.  They break.
     And then he holds her.  Tightly as the CAMERA PULLS UP to an
     AERIAL VIEW of them, embracing at the water's edge.DISSOLVE TO:EXT. MAINE TURNPIKE - AERIAL SHOT - DUSKPolice cars, lights flashing, motor down the highway.  Behind
     them... on a flatbed truck... a thirty foot giant crocodile.
     Headed down the southbound lane of the Maine turnpike.  Rolling.
     Rolling.  Rolling along.  It doesn't even look ridiculous.
     We've become accustomed to such sights.
