"Mission: Impossible", shooting draft, revised by Robert TowneMISSION:IMPOSSIBLEFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT16TH AUGUST 1995NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERSAND SOME "SCENE OMITTED" SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FORTHIS SOFT COPY.INT. KIEV APARTMENT - NIGHTWe're in a large closet.  JACK KIEFER, an athletic American
     in his late thirties wearing a headset, is wedged into a
     corner, staring at a television screen.

     The television shows a surveillance view of the living room
     that lies outside the confines of the closet.  The TV image
     is in black and white.  JACK shifts, trying like hell to get
     comfortable but he's been there a whileON THE SCREENA bare bulb shines down on the contents of a shabby hotel
     room.  Directly under the blub a man, GENNADY KASIMOV, sits
     in a straight backed wooden chair in his blood-stained T-
     shirt.  There are a couple of THUGS and a stray HOOKER in the
     room behind him.  A legend:KIEVKASIMOV is sobbing.  Uncontrollably.  A MAN enters the room,
     ANATOLY, an imperious Russian in his forties, a Russian
     godfather.  The THUGS and HOOKERS are ushered out.  ANATOLY
     looks down at KASIMOV pitiously and urges him to go and sit
     by him in a chair he picks up for him.  KASIMOV does as he is
     bid, looking gratefully up at ANATOLY.  They speak in Russian
     which is subtitled.ANATOLYKasimov, Kasimov, good that you called
                us.KASIMOV(sobbing)
                I don't remember what happened!  We were
                at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having
                fun.

     ANATOLY gets up out of the chair and goes to a bed across the
     room.  A WOMAN lies half under the sheets.  She's lying in an
     unnatural position on the bed, and the sheets are smeared
     with blood.  She's dead.  ANATOLY lifts her eyelid.KASIMOVI don't even know how I got here.
                I swear, Anatoly, I never touched her!  I
                didn't lay a finger on her.

     ANATOLY moves away from the WOMAN.ANATOLYKasimov.  Don't flounder.IN THE CLOSETJACK, impatient, checks his watch.JACKJesus, she's been under too long.  Come 
                on, come on!ON THE SCREENKASIMOVYou're the only one who can help me. 

     Desperately he tugs at ANATOLY'S jacket.  But ANATOLY hits 
     his hand away and smacks him around the head.IN THE CLOSETJACK reacts.ON THE SCREENANATOLY bends close to KASIMOV.ANATOLYC'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.KASIMOVThey'll kill me. 

     ANATOLY paces up the room, away from KASIMOV.ANATOLYYou asked for my help.  Youaskedformyhelp...come on...KASIMOVYou're right, of course.IN THE CLOSETJACK leans forward.JACKThe name pal...give us the name.ON THE SCREENKASIMOVThe contact in Minsk..the contact in 
                Minsk..works in a travel agency.IN THE CLOSETJACKCome on!ON THE SCREENANATOLYCome on!KASIMOVHis name is.....Dimitri Miediev.ANATOLYDimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev...IN THE CLOSETJACKGot him.ON THE SCREENBack on screen, ANATOLY places a hand on KASIMOV'S shoulder
     as if he had just anointed him.IN THE CLOSETIn the closet, JACK types the name into a computer and cross 
     checks -- "MIEDIEV" comes up, then "posting/American 
     consulate/Kiev." 

     JACK turns and nods to a WHOREHOUSE WAITRESS in costume in 
     the closet next to him, dressed in traditional Russian tunic 
     and virtually no bottom.  She quickly leaves.INT. SHABBY ROOM - NIGHTWe enter the room for the first time as the WAITRESS does. 
     She's carrying a tray with a bottle of vodka and two shot 
     glasses.ANATOLYNow, we drink. 

     He pours them out and hands one to KASIMOV.ANATOLY (CONT'D)To friends.KASIMOVYes, Anatoly, yes.JACKCheers. 

     He drinks.  He blinks.  Something felt funny about that. 
     Dizzied, KASIMOV swoons and passes out on the floor. ANATOLY 
     moves to the closet door and opens it.IN THE CLOSETANATOLY reaches up to his face --

     --and tears away a mask of flesh.  He's no middle aged 
     Russian mobster, he's ETHAN HUNT, an American in his early 
     thirties.  He gestures to KASIMOV contemptuously.  JACK hands 
     ETHAN a hypodermic kit and he goes quickly back into the 
     room.ETHAN(in English now) 
                Get rid of this scum. 

     Immediately, there is activity, and PEOPLE everywhere.  TWO 
     OTHERS come into the room and carry KASIMOV out. 

     ETHAN goes quickly to the body of the dead woman. He cheeks 
     the pulse in her neck, shines a penlight in her eye. He 
     strips the adrenalin kit and jabs the long needle into the 
     dead woman's thigh.  He checks her pulse again, checking a 
     stopwatch.  In about ten seconds, the woman's eyes open. 

     CLAIRE is her name, a French woman of thirty or so. She half 
     rolls over, GROANS, and wipes some of the blood from her 
     mouth.CLAIREDid we get it?ETHANWe got it.  On your feet.CLAIREI want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.ETHANWalk, just walk.  Start walking.CLAIREI'm walking.ETHANTalking's good, walking's better.CLAIRESleeping's better. 

     Meanwhile, MEN in overalls take apart the room.  The ceiling 
     lifts right off the walls, and the walls themselves start to 
     come down, revealing the "hotel room" to be an elaborate set 
     in the middle of an empty warehouse. 

     JACK comes into the room from the closet.  He hands CLAIRE 
     her jewelry, including a watch and a wedding ring.  ETHAN 
     stops what he's doing, noticing.  She looks up at him 
     questioningly.CLAIREAreyouall right Ethan.  What's wrong
                with you?ETHANIf you're gonna do this again Claire, 
                It's not gonna be on my watch.CLAIREOh yeah? 

     JACK comes into the room from the closet.  He hands CLAIRE 
     her jewelry, including a watch and a wedding ring.  ETHAN 
     stops what he's doing, noticing.  She looks up at him, 
     questioningly.JACKClaire.ETHANJack. 

     She almost unconsciously slips the wedding ring onto her 
     finger.  ETHAN notices.  He turns and SHOUTS to the room at 
     large.ETHANIS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOTOUT OF HERE YET?!JACKJust waiting for you, tubs. 

     He walks across the room and out the door.  CLAIRE, worried, 
     clutches her hands together, glancing down at her wedding 
     ring. 

     We move in on it --CUT TO:INT. JET - DAY-- and come out on another wedding ring, this one on a MAN's 
     finger. One of several he's drumming on an arm rest in the 
     plush first class cabin of a commercial airliner.  He shoves 
     some money into his wallet, and as he does so we catch a 
     fleeting glimpse of a photograph of CLAIRE. 

     The pilot's voice makes an announcement.VOICE (O.S.)Ladies and gentlemen, we have leveled off 
                at our cruising altitude of thirty-eight 
                thousand feet-and we should be arriving 
                in Prague right on schedule. 

     A FLIGHT ATTENDANT makes her way between the seats, passing 
     out menus.FLIGHT ATTENDANTWould you like to watch a movie Mr Rosen? 

     A passenger takes one.  The ATTENDANT continues on.FLIGHT ATTENDANT(CONT'D)Would you like to watch a movie Mr 
                Phelps? 

     The MAN with the wedding ring looks up.  JIM PHELPS is in his 
     mid-forties, good-looking, intense.  He's a tired man, and 
     not just now, it's a profound fatigue.  He looks up at the 
     ATTENDANT and smiles warmly.PHELPSNo, I prefer the theatre.  

     A look crosses the FLIGHT ATTENDANT'S face; her tone becomes 
     stilted.FLIGHT ATTENDANTWould you consider the cinema of the
                Ukraine?PHELPSPerhaps you'd choose one for me. 

     The ATTENDANT turns and walks away.  PHELPS sits back, shakes 
     a cigarette out of a pack, and taps it nervously on the 
     armrest.AT THE FRONT OF THE CABIN.The FLIGHT ATTENDANT opens a case loaded with video 8 
     cassettes of feature films.  She opens a panel in the top of 
     the case and withdraws a tape hidden back there.BACK AT PHELPS' SEATThe ATTENDANT returns with the tape and hands it to PHELPS. 
     He takes it without a word and she moves on. 

     PHELPS reaches down and turns a lever on the support between 
     his seat and the empty one beside him. He flips up a small 
     movie screen and angles it toward himself, away from the 
     other passengers. He puts on a headset, opens a door in the 
     armrest, and puts the tape in. 

     He presses play.ON THE TAPE,the image of a man comes on.  EUGENE KITTRIDGE is fortyish, 
     but seems permanently stuck in the Nixon era -- horn rimmed 
     glasses, short short haircut, rather be caught dead than 
     tieless.  But if he catches your eye, he will never, ever 
     look away.  He's seated at a desk, looking into the camera.KITTRIDGE(on the tape) 
                Good morning, Mr. Phelps.  The man you're 
                about to see is Aleksander Golitsyn -- 

     The screen winks and shows an image of GOLITSYN, a burly man 
     in his forties.  The image is herky-jerky videotape, 
     presumably taken from a concealed camera as GOLITSYN walks 
     down a foreign street.KITTRIDGE (O.S.)-- a former KGB Line X officer now 
                working the international black market 
                selling intelligence.  This morning, we 
                learned that Golitsyn has stolen one half 
                of a CIA NOC list, the list of our non- 
                official cover agents working in Eastern 
                Europe. 

     The screen shows an image of what such a list might look 
     like, code names and other information scrolling by on a 
     computer screen at high speed.KITTRIDGE (O.S.)For security reasons, the NOC list is 
                divided into two encoded halves. 
                Golitsyn already has the cryptonym 
                portion, which contains agent code names 
                and targeting areas.  This portion is 
                useless unless combined with the second 
                half -- the true name list that is kept 
                in the CIA station in our Embassy in Prague. 

     The Embassy itself comes on screen, a beautiful old building 
     at the base of the Charles Bridge, which spans the Vltava 
     River.KITTRIDGE (O.S.)We believe Golitsyn plans to steal the 
                true name list at an Embassy function 
                tomorrow night.  Your mission, should you 
                decide to accept it, is to obtain 
                photographic proof of the theft, apprehend 
                those involved, and return the stolen 
                list.  I don't have to stress the 
                importance of this matter, Jim.  We're 
                keeping it internally black. Because of  
                its urgency, I've already sent to Prague 
                a team selected from your usual group. 

     Still photographs come on screen, some of which we're already 
     seen -- JACK KIEFER, CLAIRE and ETHAN.KITTRIDGE (O.S.)Ethan Hunt will of course be your point 
                man, as usual.  He's in Kiev; we're 
                getting word to him now.INT. JET - DAYPHELPS sits back in his seat, closes his eyes, and rubs his 
     tired brow.  KITTRIDGE himself comes back on the tape.KITTRIDGE (O.S.)As always, should you or any member of 
                your IM force be caught or killed, the 
                Secretary will disavow all knowledge of 
                your actions.  This tape will self- 
                destruct in five seconds.  Good luck, 
                Jim! 

     PHELPS inhales deeply -- 

     -- the tape in the armrest starts to smolder, sending up a 
     plume of wispy smoke -- 

     -- and PHELPS exhales, concealing the plume in a cloud of 
     cigarette smoke.CUT TO:EXT. PRAGUE SAFE HOUSE - DAYSARAH and HANNA, a German woman in her mid-thirties enter. 
     Another legend:PRAGUEINT. SAFE HOUSE - PRAGUE - DAYThe IMF team's safe house is a sparsely furnished Prague 
     apartment with a panoramic view of the city. 

     The IMF team is scattered around the room. Sketches, pads, 
     overfilled ashtrays and equipment are strewn everywhere. 
     JACK and SARAH seated next to each other - JACK demonstrating 
     the VISCO glasses to her.  CLAIRE is seated opposite JACK at 
     the computer.  JIM and ETHAN are in the kitchen.  HANNAH 
     taking a roll of black-out curtain through the room.JACKLook to your right, then back to me. 
                There's a camera built right into the 
                bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and 
                transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?SARAHOf course I can hear you.JACKNo, in your...ear piece. You have a 
                lovely smile (eyes). Can you hear me 
                now?SARAHLoud and clear.JACKWhat's going on?SARAHI don't know.JACKWhy don't you take a look?SARAHJack...that's spying.JACKThat's what we do isn't it?SARAHJack you're so wicked.JACKToo wicked to have a drink later?SARAHI think I might just take that look. 

     ETHAN and JIM PHELPS are in a heated conversation.ETHANYeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more 
                than ninety days leave coming.PHELPSA hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. 
                Take it all, if you want.Afterthis one.ETHANI thought I'd take some now.PHELPS(quietly, to Ethan) 
                What the hell's made you decide to take 
                your leave at the worst possible time? 
                Claire's in a weird mood too.ETHANOh?  What's the problem?PHELPSI don't know, I had to go to Chicago 
                again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me.ETHANTell you what?PHELPSWhen you started noticing your short term 
                memory loss.  Whatthe problem wasyou 
                and Claire had in Kiev?ETHANWhat problem?PHELPS(laughs)
                Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking
                burnout here?ETHANI guess.PHELPSEthan, youcan'tburn out.ETHANWhy not?PHELPSBecause I can't afford it. And because 
                you'd burn up before you'd burn out. 

     CLAIRE, who is at the computer behind them, somehow seems to 
     be the reference point in the following exchange:ETHANHow was Chicago?PHELPSWonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto 
                dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the 
                one about the astronaut who comes back 
                from the first manned flight to Mars 
                after two years?  His wife's got a year 
                old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was 
                it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh,
                it was my friend Sammy."  She says it 
                wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my 
                friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter, 
                don't you think I have any friends of my 
                own?!" 

     PHELPS laughs.  ETHAN doesn't.  The back of CLAIRE'S head is 
     in his line of sight.PHELPS (CONT'D)Boy, you really are grim. Come here, 
                take a look. 

     He leads ETHAN to the window, which overlooks the city.EXT. PRAGUE - DAYETHAN's POV of Embassy.INT. SAFE HOUSE - DAYETHAN nods.PHELPS (CONT'D)Beyond Charles Bridge there is our 
                Embassy.  See it?  Tomorrow night, if

                the names of our agents in every country 
                all over Eastern Europe.  Up for grabs to 
                the highest bidders -- third world 
                terrorists, arms dealers, drug lords -- 
                any and everybody who'd love to get rid 
                of long term coverts like us, and some 
                very dear friends among them.  If they're 
                exposed, they'll be executed.  Come over 
                here.  Take a lock at this. 

     CLAIRE, who is working at a computer, has pulled up a 
     quicktime video image in a box on her screen.  In it, an old 
     edition of the McLaughlin Report, the PBS news show, is 
     playing. 

     ETHAN is distracted by it.INSERT - TELEVISIONSENATOR WALTZER, a bearded, bespectacled man in his forties, 
     is holding forth:SENATOR WALTZERI'll go you one further.  I say the CIA 
                and all its shadow organizations have 
                become irrelevant at best and 
                unconstitutional at worst.  It's time we 
                throw a little light on the whole concept 
                of the Pentagon's "black budget."  These

     that's in full swing on the second floor. 

     SENATOR WALTZER, the man who was on TV, walks up a grand 
     staircase, headed in.  An AMERICAN DIPLOMAT in a tuxedo 
     hurries up to him.DIPLOMATHow do you do, Senator, I'm Rand Housman, 
                the Ambassador's aide.  If I could just 
                steer you through the reception line here--The DIPLOMAT pilots the SENATOR by one arm, guiding him to a

                Norman? 

     He leans in and kisses her on the cheek, and as he does so 
     SARAH whispers something in his ear.SARAHHe's in pocket.  Under the archway behind me. 

     Her tone, her words -- we realize she's on the team. 

     The SENATOR pulls a pair of Visco glasses from his pocket 
     (and if we didn't know the SENATOR was ETHAN before, this 
     confirms it), puts them on, and looks up, over her shoulder.UNDER AN ARCHWAY NEAR THE ENTRANCE,ALEKSANDER GOLITSYN, the Ukrainian, has just come in from 
     outside.INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHTPHELPS sees the SENATOR's point of view of GOLITSYN, through

                     (to the Diplomat) 
                Will you excuse us?  

     He slips an arm around SARAH and they walk off, not into the 
     party, but the other way, toward a staircase that leads 
     further into the Embassy.DIPLOMATUh, sir?INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHTJACK climbs up the elevator shaft, towards the gray metal 
     box.  He just begins to remove the cover when he hears a 
     noise from above.  He looks up and sees the elevator above

     JACK quickly pulls himself flush against the wall. The 
     elevator comes down adjacent to him and stops, pinning him 
     to the wall.JACKGreat.  Come on.INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHTAs the SENATOR and SARAH pass behind the entering GOLITSYN, 
     SARAH pulls a small bottle of perfume from her purse.  But as 
     she sprays, she points it slightly to the left, missing 
     herself and hitting the back of GOLITSYN'S head.  He never 
     notices.  They move on and down the flight of stairs.INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHTJIM PHELPS monitors the Visco views of the party.  He looks

     She also has a pair of Visco glasses, which she trains on the 
     party below.  She pushes a micro switch on the side of her 
     glasses, activating an electronic filter, which tints the 
     lenses.PHELPS (O/S)Hannah, pull the shade (or - Hannah go to

     out.  That head is GOLITSYN'S, his hair a fluorescent green 
     where SARAH sprayed it.INT. THE DENIED AREA/ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHTThe SENATOR (let's just call him ETHAN) and SARAH come down 
     the stairs and pass a sign that says "Denied Area -- 
     Political Attaches Only."  ETHAN checks his watch.  23:00. 

     He nods to SARAH, they round a corner, and come to an 
     elevator at the end of the corridor.  A sign in front of it 
     says "Out of Order."  They head for it anyway. 

     A MARINE GUARD appears from behind a side door, catching them 
     by surprise.JACKGovernor's in position.  We have the elevator.GUARDExcuse me, can I help you?SARAH-- which leads directly to the Denied 
                Area, the only limited access area in the 
                whole facility. 

     SARAH flashes an ID at the GUARD and keeps talking.SARAH (CONT'D)As you can see. this area has both a 
                Marine guard and video surveillance, and 
                is strictly monitored at all times. 

     She walks up to the thumbprint analyzer on the elevator bank 
     and slides her thumb inside.  The panel lights up and flashes 
     a message -- "ACCESS DENIED."  SARAH and ETHAN trade a look.SARAH (CONT'D)(covering) 
                Senator, don't you have a young man on 
                your staff namedJACK? 

     She tries the thumb again, Still no soap.ETHANJack?  I believe we did have a young man 
                namedJack.  Not a reliable man, as I 
                recall.  Constantly late or behind in his 
                work. 

     Now the GUARD, noticing that Sarah's not being allowed 
     access, comes closer to them.GUARDExcuse me, let me see that ID again!INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHTJACK is still pinned to the wall by the elevator, listening 
     to their conversation.PHELPS (O.S.)Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a 
                second.  Keep dancing.ETHAN (O.S.)(with the Senator's southern accent) 
                We were forced to tie him to my best 
                stallion and drag him around the barn a 
                few times.  

     Finally, the elevator moves down a floor and JACK is freed.JACKRelax your crack, Foghorn, I'm workin' on
                it. 

     He quickly opens the gray metal box, revealing a maze of 
     circuitry.  He patches in his computer, climbs on top of the 
     elevator, and hits the keyboard, beginning to download.THE LAPTOPthere's a split-screen of SARAH's thumbprint and the ID 
     picture.  JACK downloads her file into the security computer.INT. THE DENIED AREA/ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHTIgnoring the GUARD, SARAH turns and slides her thumb into the 
     thumbprint analyzer once more.  The panel glows, this time 
     the message flashes --IDENTITY CONFIRMED-- and the elevator doors slide open briskly.  

     The GUARD, surprised, now catches sight of the SENATOR.GUARDOh. Sorry, sir. 

     He snaps a salute.  ETHAN and SARAH get into the elevator and 
     the doors close behind them.INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHTJACK looks down at the elevator below.  Through a grating, he 
     can see them inside.JACKThe drink (date) with Sarah is definitely

     downloading the vital information.INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (BELOW ELEVATOR) - NIGHTWaiting below the elevator, ETHAN takes off his jacket, 
     starting to reverse it.  He checks his Visco wrist monitor as 
     GOLITSYN perpetrates the theft.  He smiles and speaks into a 
     microphone.ETHANHe's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack.JACK (O.S.)Give me a break, Pops.SARAHSuch a nice ass.JACK (O.S.)And a lonely ass.ETHANSarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport

     He looks up.  The roof of the building is nearly upon him.ETHAN (O.S.)Come on, Jack, come on.

     JACK looks up again, he cringes, he covers his head with his

     He gets up and races out of the apartment.INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHTGOLITSYN,who now has the disk, jabs again and again at the
     elevator button but it won�t even light up.  He studies the
     elevator doors and jumps into the shaft, just as ETHAN and
     SARAH did moments before.

     He hits the floor of the elevator shaft and exits the small
     door at the shaft�s base.EXT. PRAGUE SAFE HOUSE - NIGHTPHELPS hurries towards the bridge.PHELPSEn route.EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - NIGHTPHELPS dashes onto the Charles Bridge and heads across the
     river, toward the Embassy.  He throws a look back, over his
     shoulder.  Paranoia�s setting in.EXT. EMBASSY (AS SEEN FROM CHARLES BRIDGE) - NIGHTOutside the Embassy, GOLITSYN escapes, pushing through the
     service area door and racing past a DRUNKEN COUPLE who are in
     the midst of a lover�s quarrel, in Russian.

     Pan past the embankment and onto the bridge where PHELPS is
     still racing to meet ETHAN.  But he stops suddenly, as if
     hearing something and looks behind him, at the deepening
     gloom.EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHTETHAN and SARAH hear PHELP�S voice over the monitor.SARAHThe package is in the open.ETHANJim.  Jim.  He�s in the open.PHELPS (O.S.)I�ve got a shadow.ETHANCan you lose him?PHELPS (O.S.)No.  Abort.

                Cut all radio communications.  

     ETHAN continues to run toward the stairs to the bridge.  Past
     CLAIRE who sits in the getaway car.  He looks on his monitor
     and again sees PHELPS� POV.  Only ominous silence.  Phelps is
     looking back over his shoulder.  The bridge is deserted.EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHTSARAH follows GOLITSYN as he hurries toward the shore, where
     a cobblestone promenade runs along the river.  He disappears
     into the fog at the edge of the river.EXT. STAIRS TO BRIDGE - NIGHTETHAN checks his monitor again.THE MONITORPHELPS� point of view changes radically as his head swivels
     on the darkened bridge.  He whirls again, looking over his
     shoulder and this timethe barrel of a gunis visible,
     pointing at him and before PHELPS has a chance to react a
     GUNSHOT CRACKLES over the monitor.

     The point of view goes crazy for a moment, then over and down
     to a bloody hole in his own chest.

     His head rocks again, then goes over the side of the bridge
     and makes the long, hard fall into the river below.EXT. STAIRS TO BRIDGE - NIGHTETHAN�s face goes white with shock.ETHANJIM!EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - NIGHTHe races up the rest of the stairs to the bridge but there�s
     no sign of PHELPS.

     ETHAN runs to the railing and looks down into the river but
     sees only dark, choppy waters below, now becoming
     obscured in the gathering fog.

     He turns and looks to the embankment.  He can faintly see
     GOLITSYN, hurrying along the promenade.  ETHAN gives chase.EXT. PARKING AREA - NIGHTETHAN runs towards the getaway car, reaching a vantage point
     on the top of the stairs, he can see CLAIRE�S outline,
     visible in the driver�s seat.  But as he descends the stairs----the car explodes and bursts into flames.

     The force of the blast knocks ETHAN back.ETHANCLAIRE!He watches the burning car in stunned silence for a moment, a 
     stunned CROWD starts to gather.

     Remembering SARAH, he rushes down the stairs towards the
     embankment.EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHTSARAH comes out of the fog near the riverbank and sees
     GOLITSYN again, slowing down.  A MAN comes out of the fog an
     seems to ask GOLITSYN for a light.

     SARAH draws closer.  Behind her, the DRUNKEN COUPLE seems to
     be hanging with her for some reason.EXT. STAIRS FROM BRIDGE - NIGHTETHAN continues towards the embankment.EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHTSARAH is almost to GOLITSYN.  Suddenly, the MAN in front of
     GOLITSYNpulls him towards him.  Sensing something wrong,
     SARAH quickens her pace.  The MAN is now hunched over
     GOLITSYN, facing away from SARAH, going through GOLITSYN�s
     pockets.

     The figure finds what it�s looking for -- the disk -- and
     takes it.  SARAH comes closer --

     -- and the figure whirls.  It brings a knife up sharply,
     plunges it into her chest and slinks away out of sight.ANGLEETHAN races around the corner onto the embankment.  He bursts
     out of the fog, just in time to see SARAH fall to her knees,
     over GOLITSYN�s body.  ETHAN sees the knife in her chest andGASPS.He pulls the knife out of SARAH, who is close to death.  He
     looks at it -- it is a black Teflon knife with a serrated
     edge.BEHIND ETHANThe DRUNKEN COUPLE seem drunk no more.  In fact, they�re
     watching ETHAN.  Through the fog and night, they see him
     leaning over SARAH, holding the knife in his hands.AT THE BODIESSARAH goes still.  ETHAN lays her down, turns the other body
     over and sees that it is GOLITSYN.  He quickly begins
     rummaging through his pockets.

     ETHAN hear police sirens and sees...ANGLEA Prague police boat, SIREN wailing, arrives at the dock in
     front of the Embassy.  The DRUNKEN MAN and WOMAN stop
     suddenly.

     As THREE POLICE leap off the boat and race toward the
     explosion, ETHAN leaps over the gate and races up the alley
     and out of sight.EXT. STREET -- PHONE BOOTH - NIGHTETHAN unscrews the mouthpiece of a payphone receiver.  He�s
     holding a flat piece of metal with six prongs on it, a 
     modernist cockroach.  He CLICKS the cockroach into the guts
     of the phone�s wiring, piercing it with its little prongs.

     He screws the mouthpiece back on, holds the phone�s tongue
     down for a second, releases it and listens.  He has a dial
     tone.  Now he punches in a fourteen digit number he knows by
     heart.

     After a moment, a FLAT VOICE comes on the other side.FLAT VOICE (O.S.)Satcom seven.ETHANCentral Europe.  Unsecured.FLAT VOICE (O.S.)Designator?ETHANBravo Echo one one.FLAT VOICE (O.S.)Switching.

     There is a long pause and then familiar voice comes on the

     Pause.  A funny series of CLICKS comes over the line.KITTRIDGE (O.S.)Go ahead.ETHANThey�re dead.KITTRIDGE (O.S.)Who�s dead?ETHANMy team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim -

                we'll worry about that, okay?  Were you
                followed?

     ETHAN closes his eyes.  KITTRIDGE�S voice is strong and
     reassuring and he needs that right now.ETHANI don�t think so.KITTRIDGE (O.S.)Don�tthink, besure.  Are you clean?ETHANYes.KITTRIDGE (O.S.)Location green.  One hour.  I�ll be there

                disappoint me.ETHANNo sir.KITTRIDGE (O.S.)One hour.

     He hangs up.  ETHAN does the same.  He stares at the phone
     for a moment, thinking.  He checks his watch.EXT. STREET - NIGHTETHAN steps out of the phone booth and starts down the
     street.  Every face seems to be starring at him now, every
     sound is menacing.  He pulls his coat in tight, shoves his
     hands in his pockets and walks among the crowd.EXT. OLD TOWN SQUARE - NIGHTETHAN makes his way past the old town clock, a towering,
     gothic structure and into a plaza, surrounded mostly by 
     residential buildings.ETHAN�S POVStraight across from him is a glass enclosed restaurant built
     on the portico of an old palace.

     Brilliantly lit up from inside, the restaurant positively
     shimmers, every table visible from everywhere in the plaza.INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHTETHAN'S POVETHAN walks in the glass front doors, right next to an 
     enormous fish tank, part of the restaurant's exterior wall. 
     He scans the clientele carefully -- maybe a dozen PATRONS are 
     scattered around. 

     EUGENE KITTRIDGE is seated at a table in the middle. He and 
     ETHAN make eye contact.  ETHAN walks to the table, a couple 
     of quick, seemingly cursory glances around the room as he 
     goes.  KITTRIDGE has been working on a pretty good-sized 
     lobster.  He rises to greet ETHAN and they sit.KITTRIDGEI can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know 
                how much Jim in particular meant to you, 
                Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally.ETHANYeah. 

     He spots a stack of documents on the table.

     ETHAN picks them up.  There's a Canadian picture bearing 
     ETHAN photo and the name Phillipe Doucette, credit cards, 
     driver's license, etc.KITTRIDGEPassport, visas - you know the drill. 
                We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada,

                night. 

     KITTRIDGE seems to be at the point of saying one thing, then, 
     carefully:KITTRIDGEYou seem hell bent on blaming yourself, 
                Ethan.ETHANWho else is left?KITTRIDGEYes.  I see your point.ETHANWhy was there another team?KITTRIDGEWhat?ETHANOf IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.KITTRIDGEI don't quite follow you.ETHANLet's see if you can follow me around

                The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 
                and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing 
                around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11.

                other IMF team.  You're worried about me.Why?KITTRIDGE(a tight little smile) 
                You're right.  Maybe this'll save some 
                time. 

     The figures around the room have grown restless.  KITTRIDGE 
     tries to indicate that it's okay. He pulls some papers out 
     of his jacket.KITTRIDGE (CONT'D)For a little over two years now we've 
                been spotting serious blowback in IMF 
                operations.  We have a penetration.  The

                Internet from a Czech we know as "Max."ETHANThe arms dealer.KITTRIDGEThat's right.  Max, it seems, has two 
                unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity
                and for corrupting susceptible agents. 
                This time he's gotten to someone on the 
                inside - he's put himself in a position 
                to buy our NOC list. An operation he 
                referred to as "Job 314".  The job he 
                thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.ETHANBut the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.KITTRIDGECorrect the actual list is safe at 
                Langley.  "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, 
                one of ours.ETHANThis whole operation was a molehunt.KITTRIDGEYes, the mole's deep inside. And -- like 
                you said.  You survived. 

     ETHAN stares at him levelly.KITTRIDGE (CONT'D)I want to show you something, Ethan. 

     He now shoves the papers across the table.  They're xeroxed 
     copies of a Wisconsin bank account in the name of DONALD and 
     MARGARET ETHAN HUNT.  It shows a balance of $127, 000.KITTRIDGE (CONT'D)Since your father's death, your family's 
                farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, 
                suddenly, they're flush with over a 
                hundred and twenty grand in the bank. 
                Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped 
                out the bank account -- dying slowly in 
                America after all, can be a very 
                expensive proposition Ethan.  So, why 
                don't we go quietly out of here onto the 
                plane...ETHANHow about if we just go quietly into the 
                bathroom and I wash your mouth out with 
                soap - you pathetic button down 
                bureaucratic asshole.KITTRIDGE (CONT'D)Ethan, I can understand you're very 
                upset.ETHANKitteridge, you've never seen me very 
                upset. 

        ETHAN takes something from his jacket pocket.  While 
        KITTRIDGE talks, ETHAN unwraps whatever is in his hand.KITTRIDGEAll right, enough is  enough Hunt. You've 
                bribed, cajoled, killed - and relied on 
                intimate loyalties to get away with it. 
                You're determined to shake hands with the 
                devil and I'm going to make sure you do 
                it in hell. 

     We see what ETHAN holds in his hand -- it's the piece of 
     bubble gum, half red, half green. He squeezes the gum, 
     mushing the two sides together. 

     ETHAN lashes out, swatting KITTRIDGE'S glass of wine off the
     table in one quick motion.  As he does, he hurls the piece of 
     gum. 

     Diners look up, startled at the sound of the breaking wine 
     glass.  KITTRIDGE follows the trajectory of the glass -- 

     -- and sees the piece of gum, stuck to the tank. His eyes 
     widen.  KA BOOM! 

     The tiny piece of plastique explodes, SHATTERING the fish 
     tank.  A hundred gallons of water flow over the MAN and 
     WOMAN, knocking them to the ground.

     pulling out a shaving cream can and a hairspray can.  He 
     unscrews the bottoms, retrieving cash in various 
     denominations from various countries and a couple of 
     passports. 

     As he pockets them, he catches sight of himself in the

     and proceeds to guzzle it as if he was dying of thirst.INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHTHe comes back into the living room. Still drinking, he

     The computer scrolls names of bulletin boards at a dizzying 
     speed, by the hundreds.  That's not going anywhere. 

     ETHAN pauses, slaking his bottomless thirst and trying to 
     figure out what permutation of "job 314" he should add to the 
     others on his computer screen.  He MUMBLES.ETHANJob three fourteen.  Job --

     He rummages around on the desk, checks the bookshelf and 
     finds a Gideon Bible.  He turns to Job 3:14 and reads the 
     Bible passage "Kings and Counsellors..."

     He grabs a sleeve and literally tears the coat off her, half- 
     spinning her around.  The coat hits the floor like a dead 
     body.  CLAIRE'S instinctive move is to cover her chest. 

     CLAIRE begins to shiver.  ETHAN circles her, runs his hand 
     cursorily across her body.  It accentuates CLAIRE'S 
     shivering.ETHAN (CONT'D)Where were you?CLAIREI walked away.  He said abort.  He was

     She sags.  A moment.  Then the clock begins to chime -- BONG,

     drawn.  The place is roomy and lavishly furnished -- 
     expensive Oriental rugs, well-chosen objects of art. 

     Somewhere down the block, a dog BARKS, steadily, every few 
     seconds. In the hallway outside the apartment door, someone 
     is VACUUMING.  MATTHIAS and the OTHER MAN are nearby.ETHANI thought I was going to see Max.MATTHIASYou misunderstood.  No one sees Max.ETHANThen what am I doing here?MATTHIASAllowing Max to see you and hear what

     A CIA ANALYST carrying a glass of iced tea and several file 
     folders walks down a long corridor in the headquarters 
     building.  He comes to an impressive guard station and rests 
     his chin on a strange-looking optometric device.ETHAN (V.O.)They missed nothing in that room.  Even 
                the vents have laser nets over them.  

     Apparently the device approves and the ANALYST is buzzed into 
     a "RESTRICTED" area of the building.INT. CIA COMPUTER ANTEROOM - DAYThe ANALYST reaches a curtained area. He shoves the curtain 
     aside and comes to a large, vaulted door.  He slides a card- 
     key into a slot, leaves it there and slides a second card-key 
     into the slot beneath it.ETHAN (V.O.)Inside, there are three countermeasure 
                systems that can only be deactivated by 
                authorized entry.  Which we won't have. 

     A panel next to the ANALYST says "INTRUSION COUNTERMEASURES 
     OFF."  The ANALYST next spins a three digit combination code, 
     CHUNKS the door open and steps into --INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY-- the secured terminal room.  It's not large but it's 
     impressive.  A single terminal is bolted into the middle of 
     the floor and the glass and tile walls of the room overlook 
     computer storage towers.ETHAN (V.O.)The first system is sound-sensitive, 
                anything above a whisper sets it off. 
                The second system is on the floor and 
                pressure-sensitive --

     The ANALYST closes the vault door behind him and walks across 
     the room.  As he walks, the floor tiles light up under his 
     feet, turning off again when he lifts the weight from them.ETHAN (V.O.)--and the third detects any increase in 
                temperature.  Even the body heat of an 
                unauthorized person in the room will 
                trigger it. 

     A thermometer on the wall shows the temperature is 72 
     degrees.  The ANALYST sets his glass down, boots up the 
     computer, and starts entering data from the file folders.ETHAN (V.O.)All three systems are state of the art.The ANALYST turns and takes a sip of his iced tea.  A drop of 
     condensation runs down the glass and hits the floor. When it 
     makes contact, the floor panel lights up.INT. TRAIN STATEROOM - NIGHTThe other team members gathered around the table look at

     PHELPS looks away.  Seems badly shaken.ETHANJim...?PHELPSI was sitting in a cafe waiting for you
                and suddenly there she was, standing in

     PHELPS breaks off abruptly.  Apparently some inner struggle
     over this threatens to overwhelm him.  Then, controlling it:PHELPS- no.  She can�t know about me.  No one

     It is approximately one a.m. .  CLAIRE is huddled in the
     corner.  ETHAN enters and stands looking at her.CLAIREWhat happened?ETHAN(walks towards her)

     She draws him down by his hand to kiss her.

     He kisses her again, more fully.  She wraps an arm around him
     and he holds onto the kiss.  The room appears to revolve
     around them.CUT TO:EXT. PRIVATE HELIPAD - DAYSuddenly it�s bright, broad daylight, so bright it hurts our

     KITTRIDGE and BARNES step off a military helicopter, blinking
     at the sunlight and hurry down the steps.

     TWO AGENTS immediately flank KITTRIDGE at the bottom and fall
     into step alongside, ready to brief him.  One of them holds
     out a small package with "for Job" written on it.

     KITTRIDGE looks at him.  He rips it open.  A note inside
     simply says:TGV.  LONDON TERMINUS
                              Noon.KITTRIDGE looks at his watch.  It�s ten to twelve.

     As he reads the note, something else falls out of the
     envelope and CLUNKS to the ground.

     He bends over, picks it up, and looks at it.  Cradled in his
     hand, we can�t see what it is.  But to him, it�s very
     interesting.

     MAX reaches down and does as instructed, finding the computer
     disk as promised.  She hands it to Matthias who strips off
     the velcro covering and slots it into the drive next to the
     computer in the briefcase.  He boots it up quickly and turns
     the briefcase containing the computer toward MAX for her to
     see.

     PHELPS puts on a pair of clear goggles, reaches a trap door 
     and climbs through it --EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY-- halfway out onto the roof of the train.  He reaches into 
     his jacket pocket and pulls out a suction cup with a handle 
     on the end of it.  He SMACKS the suction cup down on the roof 
     and pulls himself the rest of the way out. 

     He pulls out a second suction cup and SMACKS it down on the 
     smooth surface of the train. 

     Now for the tough part.  Using the suction cups, PHELPS 
     slowly pulls himself forward, a foot at a time, pulling and 
     replanting the cups as he goes.  

     He drags himself over the length of the final car, to the 
     back of the train, where the rear engine slants off sharply, 
     a window for the ENGINEER. 

     Half kneeling on the roof, PHELPS pulls out the clip from his 
     belt.

     He looks up, scanning the sky behind the train.  From out 
     of the fog, ahelicopterapproaches. 

     PHELPS turns and looks ahead, in the direction the train is

     A cable and hook swing down from the helicopter, almost 
     touching the roof of the train. PHELPS crawls closer to it. 

     ETHAN, behind him, is in a far more precarious position. 
     Without goggles or suction cups, he has to use his fingers to 
     grab small holes on the roof.  

     He is flipped over by the wind, ending up facing the other 
     way.  Loses his grip and is blown backwards over the roof.INT. HELICOPTER - DAYKRIEGER sees the Chunnel entrance approaching.  He gestures

     closer to the chunnel entrance. 

     They're now right on top of the chunnel entrance.INT. HELICOPTER - DAYKRIEGER sees the tunnel, only seconds away now.  He paws at 
     the controls, jerking back desperately on a certain lever.EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAYPHELPS kicks ETHAN and he falls off the far side of the 
     train.  PHELPS falls off the near side and holding onto the 
     strap manages to pull himself back on. 

     -- The train ZOOMS into the tunnel ---- AND THE HELICOPTER ROARS RIGHT IN BEHIND IT!INT. BUSINESS CAR/TUNNEL - MOVING - DAYAs the train roars into the tunnel, the business car goes 
     nearly dark and the message on MAX'S computer screen changes 
     one last time.  This time it says:CONNECTION TERMINATED. 
                    TRANSFER LOST.MAX'S face falls.MAXDamn!INT. REAR CAR/ENGINEER'S SECTION - DAYAnother CONDUCTOR races into the power car, past his inert 
     companion, and is shocked to see the copter right behind the 
     train.  He grabs a radio and SCREAMS into it.CONDUCTORNo, no, it'sINthe tunnel!VOICE (O.S.)Stop the train!CONDUCTORIt'll crash into us!  Accelerate, 
                accelerate.EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN/TUNNEL - DAYFor a moment, we see no one.  No ETHAN.  No PHELPS.  Moving 
     around to the other end of the car, we see where they've 
     gone.They're dangling from either side of it. 

     PHELPS paws for one of the suction cups and pulls himself 
     back onto the roof of the train.  ETHAN reaches for the other 
     cup. 

     The helicopter, fortunate that this tunnel is double track 
     and barely wide enough to accomodate it, pursues, KRIEGER 
     pushing it up to full speed again. 

     But it can't lift up high enough to go completely over the 
     train.EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN/TUNNEL - DAYPHELPS, nearing the back, manoeuvers himself to the 
     windshield of the rear power car, trying to grab the skid of 
     KRIEGER'S copter. 

     He doesn't see what's headed toward him, coming from the 
     other direction. 

     Another train. 

     At the last moment, PHELPS notices the reflection of the 
     oncoming train in the windshield and swings back onto the 
     roof of his train, barely avoiding getting creamed by it as 
     it blows by. 

     The helicopter avoids the oncoming train too -- and PHELPS 
     misses the skid.  

     KRIEGER tips the front of the copter, trying to decapitate 
     ETHAN with the rotor.  PHELPS jumps onto the skid, but the 
     copter pitches so far forward the blade hits the top of the 
     tunnel.  SPARKS and chunks of cement fly.  

     KRIEGER levels the chopper quickly.  ETHAN uses the moment to 
     leap from the train onto the other helicopter skid. 

     PHELPS and ETHAN now hang on the skids, facing one another. 
     Crouching on the skid, ETHAN digs in his pocket and pulls 
     out -- 

     --a red and green piece of bubble gum. 

     PHELPS sees it and SCREAMS at KRIEGER, who scrambles 
     frantically for his gun.ETHANRed light, green light.  Asta Lasagna 
                mother fucker. 

     ETHAN mashes the red into the green, slaps the gum onto the 
     copter's underbelly and turns away from it. 

     PHELPS kicks vainly at the gum, SCREAMING -- 

     -- but the gum EXPLODES.  The force of the blast rockets 
     ETHAN forward, he lands on the train's windshield. 

     The helicopter whirls and BASHES into the tunnel, veers 
     wildly, then pitches forward and down, smashing PHELPS under 
     the skid and EXPLODING in a giant fireball. 

     ETHAN, stuck on the windshield, can only watch as the 
     wreckage of the copter tumbles down the train towards him. 
     It stops just short of him, with its bent and broken rotor 
     blade barely missing his throat.  

     ETHAN lays his head against the windshield glass, utterly 
     drained.INT. BUSINESS CAR/TUNNEL - MOVING - DAYKITTRIDGE comes back into the business car and is joined by 
     BARNES.  LUTHER, only slightly bruised, stands up next to 
     them and gestures to MAX and her laptop.LUTHERI think this is what you're looking for. 

     MAX looks up, stunned.  KITTRIDGE leans over and peers at her 
     screen. He just smiles and sits down next to her, content to 
     wait for her to speak. 

     When she finally does, she's almost charming.MAXMy lawyers will have a field day with 
                this.  Entrapment, jurisdictional

     friendly.KITTRIDGEMaybe we'll just keep the courts out of

     he sips a beer.  A television screen is featuring follow-up 
     coverage of yesterday's dramatic helicopter-train wreck in 
     the chunnel.  Aside from emphasizing that it was the work of 
     a lone, crazed character in a helicopter who was killed in 
     the crash, there are comments about how miraculous it was 
     there were no other fatalaties.  There are intermittent

                better I'll always think of you that way. 

     The two men understand one another and LUTHER will say no 
     more.  The two exchange slight gestures of farewell and in a 
     moment ETHAN disappears from the bar, leaving a contemplative 
     LUTHER looking after him.INT. PLANE - NIGHTETHAN HUNT slumps down in his scat, dosing. A FLIGHT
