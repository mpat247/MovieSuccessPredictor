                            Nick VilliersSECOND DRAFTDECEMBER 12, 1994FADE IN:A PAIR OF HANDSmen's hands, nicely groomed, hold a small white terry
          towel spoiled by blood-red spots. The hands rinse the
          towel in a copper bar sink. The stains soften but stay.
          A tan jacket sleeve, spotted the same way, moves INTO
          FRAM. The hands dab the wet towel at the spots, with no
          more success, and throw it into the sink. It falls half
          in, still dripping the stains a drop at a time to the
          floor.ALL IN CLOSEUPThe owner of the hands walks to a wine rack, opens a
          bottle of white wine, drizzles the wine on the jacket
          sleeve. The stains disappear. He hangs his jacket on a
          hook and walks fromTHE CELLARand up the narrow stairs. His FOOTFALLS ECHO against the
          unadorned cement block walls. We see his shape, mid-
          forties, powerful, his shirt pulled out. He's carrying
          the open bottle by the neck.2 INT. WINE STORE - NIGHTStill seen from behind, the man emerges from the cellar
          into a contrastingly elegant space with a wood-beamed.
          ceiling, vaguely European. He walks along a narrow aisle
          of wooden diamond bins. As the space widens his foot hits
          something in his path. He bends to find a shoe. He
          glances about nervously. There are shutters on the
          storefront windows. Shoe in hand, he tightens the
          shutters. We see his profile, a good-looking man.
          He walks toward a brighter room at the back of the store,
          the Tasting Room. Now he retrieves a pair of women's
          trousers from the floor, and as he straightens up we see
          his entire face, genial, venial, redeemed by his smile.
          ALEX GATES. He speaks nonchalantly toward the room.ALEXTwenty people tonight. I got a
          South Beach widow, a plastic surgeon --
          they actually came together.(A BEAT)These people -- all they really want
          is something to brag about at dinner
          parties.
          He swigs from the bottle of white wine, grimaces, detours
          behind the counter, and spits the mouthful into the
          plastic lined wastebasket. He throws the bottle away.(CONTINUED)2.22 CONTINUED:There's a basket of baguettes on the counter. Alex breaks
          off an end and chews it to rid his mouth of the taste of
          the wine. Still chewing, he walks toward the tasting
          room.ALEXThere I was, passing the wine,
          passing the bread, I suddenly felt
          like the priest at Masst Or maybe
          Mass started out as a wine tasting,
          and Jesus was a salesman. what do
          you think?
          He goes intoTHE TASTING ROOMIt seems empty except for a large wooden table, folding
          chairs in disarray, open bottles clustered at one end of
          the table. A chalkboard on the wall has CHATEAU
          BEYCHEVELLE written across it at the top, vintages listed
          underneath. The woman's voice that replies is
          Gabriella's.GABRIELLA (0.S.)(with a throaty laugh)
          Maybe I should get dressed.
          Leaning against the corner is a woman wearing only her
          panties and a shirt. In her mid-twenties she has striking
          South American looks. GABRIELLA VASQUEZ. She's sipping
          red wine from a plastic glass.GABRIETMI don't want to spoil a religious
          experience.ALEX-- Ever heard of Georges Duboeuf?
          He throws away some of the glasses.ALEXDuboeuf has a nose and a palate --
          like a gift from God. He can taste
          a single grape before the harvest...
          and describe the beaujolais it's
          going to produce.
          She laughs.GABRIELLAOh, you have competition.(CONTINUED)3.22 CONTINUED: (2)ALEX(SLIGHTLY ANNOYED)You know how many bottles I have in
          this store? Open any one of 'em,

          lindfolded.
          He bends down to pick up the chunks of baguette strewn on
          the floor. He doesn't see her slip off her panties.
          She walks behind him, twirling them into a tight band.
          She whips them over his eyes. He laughs.GABRIELLAOkay. Show me.ALEXVictoria's Secret 95.
          She passes her glass under his nose.ALEXGabriella, I picked these wines.GABRIELLASo what is it?ALEXAll I can smell is your perfume.
          She laughs.GABRIELLAI'm not wearing any.ALEXI even bought it for you.
          She opens her shirt. She's not wearing a bra. She lowers
          her breast to the glass and then to his mouth.GABRIELLATell me now.
          He kisses her wet breast.ALEX(WITHOUT HESITATION)Beychevelle '83. Lot of body. Very
          aggressive.
          He pulls off the panty blindfold, kisses her on the mouth
          softly, then fully.(CONTINUED)4.22 CONTINUED: (3)GABRIELLA(LOW)-- I lo e y u, Alex.V O33 INT. WINE SHOP - NIGHT (LATER)Alex is unlocking the door for Gabriella. Dressed, she

          Alex lets out a breath.ALEXOh, yeah... We're pretty good.
          He kisses her goodbye, unlocks the door. She goes out to
          her Honda Civic. Alex doesn't wait to see her drive off
          before he heads back to finish cleaning up the tasting
          room.44 INT. TASTING ROOM - NIGHTAlex straightens the last chair and starts to extract air
          from the open bottles. He hears a quiet CLANK of METAL.
          Instantly alert, he reaches for his jacket and turns off
          the-light.55 INT. WINE SHOP - NIGHTBehind the cash register Alex opens a drawer and takes out
          a revolver. ze thumbs the safety off. The NOISES RECUR,
          like someone trying to break in through the back door from
          the parking lot. Alex slings his jacket casually over the
          gun.5.66 EXT. WINE SHOP - NIGHTAlex throws open the back door; he's counting on the
          element of surprise.HIS POVHis red Cadillac convertible is idling nose.to the chain
          locked across the parking lot. A MAN in his twenties,
          whose tropical shirt fairly glows under the security
          lights, is using a pair of bolt cutters on the chain.ALEX(ADVANCING)You think you're gonna steal my car,
          asshole?
          The younger man whirls around.YOUNG MANYou scared me, man.
          A middle-aged man, a REPO MAN, calls out lazily from
          behind the wheel.REPO MANThis is not your car, sir. This car
          belongs to the Star Leasing Company.
          Alex buries the gun in the rear of his waistband as though
          he's rubbing his stiff back and cranks his smile to a
          higher wattage than the security lights.REPO MANI can collect either the money or
          the car. Given how much you owe, I
          figure it's the car.
          The younger man has almost hacked through the chain.ALEXPop the. trunk.REPO MANWe inventory the property at the
          yard.
          He keeps his eye on the chain, ready to gun the engine as
          soon as the exit is clear.ALEXI just want to show you something.
          Worked by the combination of natural curiosity and Alex's
          charm; the repo man pops the trunk and gets out of the
          still-running car.(CONTINUED)6.66 CONTINUED:In his hand he has the locking "Club" Alex usually uses to
          secure his. steering wheel. He's not stupid. Amused, Alex
          takes a step back, palms up.YOUNG MANWhat are you doing?
          The repo man ignores him and looks in the trunk.ALEXDo you drink?REPO MANNot on the job. What is this,

          yourselves. Isn't that worth a few
          days' breather...(A BEAT)My accountant's a fuck-up. So am I,
          maybe, for not firing him.
          The bolt cutters clip through. The chain falls.YOUNG MANWe're clear.77 INT. CADILLAC - NIGHTAlex is driving fast, top down, Samba MUSIC loud on the

          topple; he grabs it before it goes over.99 INT. CONDO - NIGHTAlex lets himself in. The entry ALARM starts to BEEP. He
          turns it off and resets it. The light has been left on in
          the kitchen.1010 INT. KITCHEN - NIGHTJASON, a handsome, troubled 17-year-old with long, dark
          hair, is filing barbs off a pile of fishing hooks on the
          center island. He looks harder and wiser than his years.
          Tackle is strewn everywhere. Some spaghetti remains in
          the pot it was cooked in and Jason's knife is standing
          upright in it. Alex walks into the kitchen. He makes an
          effort to be pleasant, although he's irritated by the
          mess, by the motorcycle.ALEXIt's late, Jason.JASONI'm going out tonight.

          mother's asleep.STAIRSJASONIf you got home on time once in a
          while, maybe she could skip the

          Alex is also on the stairs.ALEXYou have no idea, none, zip, what
          goes on in a marriage.JASONYeah, well, I'm learning more than
          I want to.(CONTINUED)'9.1010 CONTINUED: (2)LANDING UPSTAIRSSUZANNE (O .S=.. )Now what are you arguing about?SUZANNEis a pretty young woman in her late thirties with a sense
          of humor and irony. She's chemically relaxed, but not
          stupefied. She pulls a robe around herself, modest in
          front of her son; and although her body's not spectacular,
          like Gabriella's, she has a trim. athletic build.JASONIt's not an argument.ALEXI asked him to clean up downstairs.SUZANNE(SOOTHING ALEX)Maybe he hadn't finished-ALEXA modicum of cooperation, you know?JASONA modicum. What's that. Modicum my

          himself. Eyes squeezed shut, he lets out a long breath.
          His life demands more energy than he has anymore. He
          soaps himself thoroughly.1313 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHTSuzanne hears the front DOOR SLAM. Jason's DUCATI STARTS
          UP and ACCELERATES away. Alex comes out of the bathroom

          She stumbles slightly against the bed, catches a bed post
          for balance, flops back on the bed with a laugh.SUZANNE-- maybe I'd better lie down.
          He bends down to kiss her, then heads for the television.
          Suzanne props herself up on her elbows. He pops a
          cassette into the VCR: porno, she assumes. She does her
          best.SUZANNEI liked the twin nurses. There was

          the tape, which begins with sweat-slick dancing girls at

          a travelog.SUZANNERio?ALEXI've been so busy. We could sneak
          away for a week.. Would you like
          that?SUZANNEIf we really go. Last time I
          packed, we went nowhere.ALEX(SLEEPILY)Last time was different.SUZANNE(watching the tape)
          The beaches -- I thought we had a
          beach. I read how the hotels keep
          spotters on the roof with scopes, to
          keep thieves away from the guests.
          They can look at every inch of your
          body through the scope.
          (with a low laugh)
          Do you mind that I like that? Alex?
          He has fallen asleep. Tenderly she draws the sheet to his
          shoulder and settles down to watch the rest of the tape.DISSOLVE TO:14 EXT. BOAT - DAWN 14On the flying bridge of an old fishing boat, Jason eases
          the throttle to idle speed. The engine quiets down. The
          SWELLS SLAP harder against the wooden sides. The boat
          dips and dances to the music of the water.
          Jason swings down the ladder. He sets up his linis to
          troll. The starry dome of the sky is starting to brighten
          around its rim. Jason leans on the transom and stares at
          the flat, silvery wedge of wake. He breathes out a word.JASON:. Bite...(CONTINUED)12.1414 CONTINUED:Nothing happens. He doesn't move. Then the top of one of
          the rods shivers slightly, goes still. Jason delicately
          fingers the rod like a blind man reading Braille, to feel
          for vibration. A smile pulls at his mouth. He steps
          behind the rod. The fish hits.JASON(CALLING OUT)Henryl Fish ont
          The line screams out. Jason's ready. He sets the hook.JASONTime to go to work, man! C'mon.

           weathered his head for some time.HENRYWho we got?JASONLet's find out.

          of the good stuff. Damn.
          He spits over the side. Jason grins.JASONThis one's got more to worry about

          a fresh gash across his arm.JASONHe was already gaffed onto the side
          of the boat, good as dead. Two
          hours dead! And I was still too
          close to the mouth. Revenge is the
          last instinct to go, did you know
          that?
          The chef shrugs and shows his thumb, missing a joint.CHEF-- Work's a dangerous thing.
          (smiling with lots ofTEETH)Nice fin, Jason.

          cracking the safe. He has re-wired the alarm wire with
          electrical clips to avoid breaking the circuit. He smears
          the sweat off his forehead and leans back in close to the
          dial, rotating it carefully back and forth until the
          tumblers fall. It opens. victor sifts through papers,

          becomes a wheeze.6060 INT. LANDING - DAYThe new guard follows Alex onto the landing. They hear a
          DOOR SHUT. The guard instinctively touches his gun.ALEXDown there, wasn't it?

          She shivers involuntarily.JASONHe was a fisherman.GABRIELLAI don't know if I would like boats

          water.GABRIELLAHow old were you?JASON-- Eight. I'd just turned eight.
          She takes his hand. He tightens his fingers through hers
          and looks out at the horizon, trying to control the
          emotions her sympathy has roiled. Gabriella senses this.
          She puts her arms around him, kisses him on the cheek.
          They stand, holding each other. Then Jason, on impulse,
          kisses her on the lips.46.6363 INT. VICTOR'S APARTMENT - DAYThe KEY is heard in the LOCK, the door opens, Victor and

          Alex advances on him.ALEXYou put me in the shot.VICTOR(MODESTLY)Speaking of insurance.
          Alex is closing on him. His voice is low and menacing.ALEXGive me the film, Victor._

          the cash drawer and takes out all the money, fattens his
          wallet. He spies the message from Gabriella. He reads

          boat, a seat cushion under her head. He has his hand in
          her panties. She clutches his wrist and pulls his hand
          back into sight. He lifts his head to look at her.GABRIELLA(SOFTLY)I can't.
          He sits up, offended.JASONYou waited long enough to tell me.

          She scrambles to her feet.GABRIELLAI want to go back now. Can we go
          back, please?JASON... Sure.
          He stands up and moves to the helm, his legs stiff with
          injured dignity.
          Gabriella sits down on the bench, the cushion clutched in
          front of her.
          Jason sneaks a look back at her. With her hair wet and
          her makeup washed away, she looks younger than he does.
          She's resting her chin on the edge of the cushion.
          He switches on the engine and eases the boat forward over
          the anchor, engages the power winch. The CHAIN starts toCLANK.JASONI'm sorry.

          too crowded and too noisy; the television on the buffet
          can hardly be heard. Gabriella's Cousin and her Husband
          are arguing in Spanish, in a good-natured marital way, the
          Kids too busy teasing each other to notice. One Kid gets
          up to raise the volume on the TV set even louder.
          Gabriella carries her plate into the kitchen to escape the
          noise. The Husband makes a gesture to his Wife that says

          She sees Alex's Cadillac already parked.73 EXT. CAR - NIGHT 73She locks her car and walks toward the elevator, carrying
          a department store shopping bag. The garage is darker
          than she likes. Her HEELS ECHO against the cement walls.
          She walks a little faster.74 INT. CONDO - NIGHT 74Suzanne lets herself in. Alex didn't set the alarm. She
          sets the bag on the couch, next to his jacket. She's been
          a wife too long not to tidy up after him. She picks up
          the jacket to brush it and hang it correctly, and glimpses
          the airline tickets tucked in the inside pocket. Suzanne
          smiles, moved. The tickets to Rio. She takes a peek to
          see the dates. Her face changes. She drops the jacket in
          a heap on the floor. She hears ALEX MOVING around in the
          bedroom above and starts up the stairs, her rage climbing
          with every riser. She can hear him HUMMING.75 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 75Alex zips his passport into an outside compartment where
          he can reach it. He has almost finished packing. As he
          reaches for his underwear, he startles. Suzanne is
          leaning against the door frame.SUZANNE(CONTROLLED)Where are you going?

          Suzanne snatches his car keys off the coffee table.
          Infuriated, he grabs for his keys, but she holds them away
          behind her back.SUZANNE-- You're going to talk to me!ALEXWhen I get back.SUZANNEWith more of your fucking lies! I

          He hits her back, her nose starts to gush, the keys drop
          to the-floor. He bends to pick them up. Suzanne seizes
          a standing metal ashtray and savagely swipes him across

          square of sheet rock has been sliced away between the
          studs to accommodate the pouch. He drops the pouch in his
          tackle box. A CAR is heard pulling up. Jason frantically

          it isn't Alex in the bed, it's Gabriella. She lets out a
          strangled scream. He whips the sheet off her with his
          other hand. She's naked.GABRIELLAJason!

          -- Don't hurt me. Please.JASONWhere is he?GABRIELLAHe went to get you! He's not coming
          back until tomorrow.
          She timidly pulls the sheet over her body. Jason yanks it
          off her so hard it flaps loose from the corners. He
          touches her belly with the length of his knife, the blade
          • flat to her skin. She freezes.JASONHis car's here.GABRIELLAIt's been here since he went to
          Napa.JASONI keep hearing about Napa. Did you

          knife down.
          She knows men and children well enough to demand, not beg.
          Jason has almost forgotten he still. has the knife against
          her. He lifts it and folds it and puts it away.JASONI'm going to wait for him, and. I'm
          going to kill him.
          His hand drifts along her body. She doesn't resist.GABRIELLAThey'll lock you up.JASONYeah.GABRIELLA'Away from the sky and the air and
          the sea and the current running
          against the wind?' That was a very

          He shrugs; he doesn't trust her.GABRIELLAHow do you know?
          She thinks grief has driven him crazy, and he sees that.JASONI'm not crazy.
          Gabriella lays her hand over his on the bed, to comfort
          him.GABRIELLA... I'm so very sorry about what
          happened to your mother.
          His hand skitters away and lights on her ribs.JASONHer loss, your gain.
          Furious, Gabriella forgets her caution. She slaps him
          hard enough to throw his head sideways. Jason rolls on
          top of her and pins her down.JASONHer home, her bed -- her life.
          He lowers his mouth to Gabriella's neck. His kiss is
          surprisingly gentle. His knee works her legs apart.GABRIELLA. Don't do this for revenge.(CONTINUED)94.176176 CONTINUED: (3)JASONLet's finish what we started.
          Slowly, he kisses her. She lets her mouth respond: a
          sweet kiss, in spite of the circumstances.
          His fingers scissor her nipple.JASONJust don't tell me that you love me.
          He peels off his T-shirt.GABRIELLA(in a whisper)
          I love you.
          He gives her a hard look. She holds his gaze and pushes
          his jeans down until he finally kicks them off and they're
          both naked. They begin to make love.GABRIELLAWait.
          Jason doesn't understand. She gently pushes him back.GABRIELLAThis way.

          Jason moves now rapidly.GABRIELLASlowly.

          young man in a long time.GABRIELLA(IN SPANISH)What are you doing to me?(IN ENGLISH)Don't come, not yet.
          They move as one, their passion enveloping them.
          He makes her come first. Then, when her boay flattens, he
          also comes and he's lying on top of her, his face
          alongside hers, their breath gentling. Finally, they lie
          side.by side.GABRIELLAWill you get me a towel? With warm

          in the dark, having a nap. He's awakened by a nasty
          wheeze. Victor is standing over him.ALEXA man with your breeding usually
          rings the doorbell.VICTORThere was, is, no time.(CONTINUED)109.205 CONTINUED: 205ALEX(SITTING UP)You heard the news.
          Victor pulls one of Alex's golf clubs out of the bag as
          though to admire it.VICTORI know you keep money here
          somewhere.(A BEAT)Your stash. Give it to me.
          Alex spreads out his hands.AALEXVic, Vic --
          The golf club catches him in the midsection. Alex cries
          out. The blow folds him forward onto his knees.VICTORThe. cops are about to drive up your
          street.
          He brings the club down on Alex's bare foot.ALEX(through teeth clenchedWITH PAIN)There's nothing here to.give you.VICTORWhere is it?
          He clips Alex on the other leg as he tries to crawl away.
          The physical effort shortens Victor's breathing. His
          cough sprays blood. He tightens his grip on the club.ALEX "Believe me -- I swear to God, IDON'T --Victor raises the club over Alex's head, and brings it
          down on the coffee table instead. The glass-explodes. He
          has to push the words out through a•coughing spasm.VICTORI refuse to die in a fucking prison
          clinic!
          Alex staggers to his feet. Victor is struggling for
          breath. Alex jerks the golf club away from him and tosses
          it on the floor.(CONTINUED)110.205205 CONTINUED: (2)He puts his arm around victor's waist and helps him to the
          sofa.ALEXCome on, this is pitiful.
          Victor drops onto the sofa. He gags on the blood in his
          throat and desperately draws in air.ALEXWhat a mess.
          He picks up a sofa pillow to arrange it for him. Victor
          gives him a grateful smile. Alex presses the pillow down
          over his face before he can react. His feet flail. Alex
          has to lie on top of him to hold him down. A couple
          making out on the couch. The GUN THUMPS to the floor.
          Victor's movements slow, and stop. Alex takes no chances.
          He keeps the pillow jammed down until there's no
          possibility of trickery. Satisfied, he rolls Victor's
          dead body onto the floor, steps over it, and with steady
          hands he opens a bottle of very expensive wine. He pours
          a glass.ALEX(QUIETLY)At least you got to die in your own
          clothes, Vic. That's something.206206 EXT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHTA few Truckers make remarks as Gabriella walks toward the
          bank of phones. "Hey, pretty lady." "Possibility?"
          "She's not your type." She doesn't mind swinging her hips
          a little for their benefit.207207 INT. CONDO - NIGHTThe PHONE is RINGING. Alex sits in a chair in the dark.
          Then he crosses to the phone, picks it up and waits for
          the caller to speak.208208 INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHTGabriella is watching for Jason. INTERCUT as needed.GABRIELLA(into the phone)
          I'm with him.(CONTINUED)208208 CONTINUED:ALEXWhat took you so long.GABRIELLAHe has a boat, Alex! It's on the
          boat. The dumb shit wants to turn
          it over to the cops. You know
          what'll happen to me.
          Alex is taking his passport out of his desk.ALEXJust tell me how to find you.
           He opens another drawer. There's a gun inside.209209 INT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHTJason comes out of the men's room. He doesn't see
          Gabriella for a moment. A couple of truckers block his
          view. Now he catches sight of her. She's coming from the
          direction of the phones, a can of soda in her hand. Their
          eyes meet. She smiles and waves the can, hurries to meet
          h1m.210210 EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHTThe motorcycle cruises up the coast road. The surf glows
           with plankton.GABRIELLApresses her cheek against Jason's back.211211 EXT. DOCK - NIGHTJason secures the motorcycle. He puts his arm around
          Gabriella, they walk down the dock to his boat. He helps
          her aboard.JASON(CALLING OUT)HENRY --Henry emerges from the cabin. He eyes Gabriella.HENRYOh, my.(CONTINUED)112.211211 CONTINUED:JASONThis is Gabriella. She's my

          to shake her hand.HENRYKid's a sucker for dark skin.212 INT. BOAT - NIGHT 212Gabriella and Jason tenderly make love in the swaying
          cabin.213 EXT. BOAT - NIGHT 213On watch, Henry finds his gaze sliding to the NOISY
          dockside BAR, its beer sign beacon-bright. The SOUNDS
          BELOW embarrass him. He makes up his mind. He swings off
          the boat and heads toward the bar. He doesn't notice
          Alex's Cadillac idling in the alley. The headlights click
          off, the motor goes silent. The BOATS CREAK against the
          slips.214 INT. BOAT - DAY 214Jason wakes up with a start. He senses something. He
          slides out from under the sleeping weight of Gabriella's
          arm and pulls on his jeans, reaches up to open the cabin
          hatch.HIS POVAlex's foot swinging. More of him comes INTO SIGHT as
          Jason climbs to deck. The financial pages open on his
          lap, he's drinking a Styrofoam cup of coffee and eating a
          donut; the rest of the bag of donuts is next to him.ALEXGood morning! I brought donuts.
          Jason is struck silent. He sits down on the side of the
          boat, his arms around his ribs.ALEXOh, it's not as bad as all that.JASONShe fucking called you.(CONTINUED)113.214214 CONTINUED:Alex shrugs.ALEXShe has some residual loyalty, yeah.(MODESTLY)Which I didn't expect either.
          Jason moves to the helm, switches on the engine. Alex
          quickly finishes his donut. He brushes off his fingers.ALEXWhere are we going?JASONI'm going fishing. Get off if you
          want.ALEXNo, it's a beautiful day for a boat
          ride. Give us a chance to talk.
          He makes himself comfortable.JASONThen make yourself useful and cast
          off the stern line.
          Alex moves to the stern while Jason casts off the bow
          line.ALEXThis one?JASONThere's not a lot of choice.
          Alex casts off. Jason backs the-boat into position. He
          sees Henry asleep in the doorway of the marine supplies
          store next to the shuttered bar. Alex rejoins him.ALEX-- If we could manage to ignore the
          personal history here, I think we
          could work something out between us.
          Jason turns the boat toward the open sea.ALEXYou want Gabriella? This is the way
          to have her. Life costs, Jason.
          Love costs. And you love her more
          than I do.(MORE)(CONTINUED)114.214214 CONTINUED: (2)ALEX (CONT'D)(as Jason glances atHIM)So stake yourself to a life
          together. Give her what she needs --(SEEING GABRIELLAbefore Jason does)
          -- Hi, honey.
          Gabriella comes up onto deck. She glances bewildered at
          the ocean around them.GABRIELLAWhy are we --JASON-- Shut up! Just shut up!
          She sits on the bench, her face tight and angry.ALEXHe's feeling like you let him down.
          .She gives Alex a look that silences him. He reaches for
          another donut. The SOUNDS of the ENGINE and the HULL
          hitting the waves substitute for conversation.215 EXT. BOAT - DAY (LATER) -215Jason finishes setting the lines.JASON-- Okay. I'm ready to listen.
          He sits down beside a pole and looks over at Gabriella,
          who has put on a hat. She's staring out to sea.JASON(TO GABRIELLA)Alex wants to make me an offer.
          She gives no sign of having heard him.ALEXWe're giving you a hard choice,
          Gabby. Two rich men.
          Gabriella swivels her head slowly.GABRIELLAI don't want either one of you.
          A line quivers. Jason reels in a little.(CONTINUED)115.215215 CONTINUED:JASONSomething's going to bite, justABOUT --(his biceps tightening)
           -- now.
          And the bait is taken at the moment he said. The line
          reels out very, very fast. He lets the fish run with it.
          Gabriella has turned around to watch. Now Jason reels in
          a little, making the line taut, testing the weight.
          He yanks back. The line rises from the ocean, bringing to
          the surface a big, dark green fish. _ALEXJesus! What the hell is that?JASONHammerhead. Young. Male.
          Jason plays the shark until it's close to the boat and
          thrashing for its life. Gabriella's scared.GABRIELLAHelp him, Alex.ALEXI'd just get in his way.
          His hand comes to rest on her shoulder as Jason expertly
          reels in the bucking hammerhead. She shrugs away from his
          hand. Jason has hooked a ten-foot, three-finned sea beast
          with a spade-shaped head and black eyes on each side. He
          attaches the line to a winch and winds it up onto the
          deck. It twists wildly, knocking things over until it
          slows down and finally lies very still. His chest heaving
          with the effort, Jason looks around. Alex has disappeared
          without either of them noticing.216 INT. CABIN - DAY 216Alex is searching frantically.JASON (O.S.)No luck?
          Alex whirls around. His gun materializes in his hand.
          Jason retreats a step.JASONIs this your backup plan?(CONTINUED)116.216216 CONTINUED:ALEXNo.JASONYou want it so bad, it's yours.
          He pulls out the necklace and hurls it away from Alex.ALEX(MOANING)You little prick.217217 INT./EXT. CABIN - THE NECKLACEskitters along the deck. The shark's body stops it from
          dropping out the open gate in the transom.ALEXscrambles toward the necklace.GABRIELLADon't let him have it! He'll killUSLJason grabs her-and holds her with both arms to keep her
          from going any closer. Alex turns his head, puzzled,
          warned. Too late. The shark suddenly thrashes, its jaws
          snapping around him. Gabriella screams with Alex. He
          FIRES his GUN over and over until it's empty. The shark
          continues to tear at him.ALEXHelp me, help.mel!
          Gabriella runs down into the cabin. Much as he hates
          Alex, Jason can't let him die. like this. He charges.
          forward and straddles the shark, jams the blade of his
          knife into the primordial brain. He twists the handle
          once. The shark dies instantly. Trembling with
          adrenalin, Jason gets off its back. With his elbows Alex
          drags himself out of the jaws. He's badly mangled.. The
          shark slowly changes color to a dull brown.ALEXYou knew it wasn't dead.
          Jason squats down beside him to access his injuries.JASONMom didn't take the necklace.
          did.(CONTINUED)117.217 CONTINUED: 217Alex struggles to stay conscious.ALEXThen you killed her yourself.
          Jason slowly nods.JASONAnd you were in the car behind us.
          Gabriella drops down beside them. She has a flare gun, no
          longer needed, and sheets from the cabin to stop the
          bleeding. She starts to tear them up. She's crying
          slightly.GABRIELLAWe were supposed to turn him ini I
          didn't think you were going to kill
          him!JASONWell, I didn't.
          Alex manages to laugh.ALEXJesus. You set me up. You had her
          call me.(TO GABRIELLA)Shit... I believed you.
          Jason pushes to his feet and heads for the cockpit.JASONI'll get on the radio.
          Gabriella wraps the strips of sheet tightly around what's
          left of Alex to bandage. She smears away the tears so she
          can see and leaves blood tracked across her face. She
          looks down to see his bloody hand clutching the necklace.
          They look at each other.JASONhas the microphone in his hand. He's setting course.
          Gabriella appears behind him. She's holding the flare
          gun. She puts it back where she found it, and steps
          beside him and puts her arm around his waist. He lays his
          arm over her shoulders and holds her close while he uses
          the radio.JASONThis is Hercules II, calling the
          Harbormaster...218 EXT. BOAT - DAYThe boat heads back to port.219219 EXT. DOCK - DAYAt an unused pier Gabriella leans back against the line to
          hold the boat in place. Henry and Jason carry Alex off
          the boat and lay him on the planks. SIRENS can be faintly
          heard. Jason leaps back on the boat. Henry pushes them
          off.CLOSER ANGLEHENRYYou cool?JASONI will be.HENRYSee ya.
          He and Jason wave goodbye. The boat moves out. Henry is
          left with Alex.ALEX(weakly; to Henry)
          What's your name?HENRYNo way --ALEX(still the salesman)
          -- No, listen, listen -- this is

          And he walks away fast.ALEXWait, don't go! Come back here.
          Come on back!

          Henry's gone. Alex rolls onto his belly and starts
          dragging himself down the dock, too much of an optimist to
          give up hope in a hopeless situation.
