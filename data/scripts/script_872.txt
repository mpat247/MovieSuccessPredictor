                              Larry MarcusMarch 30, 19671 ALLEY LOADING PLATFORM AND CORRIDOR OF FAIRMONT HOTELNIGHTThe story begins in this grubby alley, where two extra
          large ambulances screech to a stop beside a loading
          platform. Onlookers gather in the alley entrance to
          see how many people died; nobody died, the backdoors
          of the ambulances are opened by attendants, and six
          perfectly fine victims of perfectly terrible automobile
          accidents are lifted into wheelchairs.
          The cripples are beautifully dressed, the men in tuxedos,
          the women in splendid evening dresses. One of the women
          wears a neck brace which forces her always to look
          skyward, so she cantt see the beautiful orchid corsage
          pinned to her bosom.
          Quickly, attendants roll the wheelchairs past all the
          stacks of fruit and vegetables on the loading platform,
          past great bales of laundry, past whatever horrors one
          finds behind the warm, smiling face of a hotel. Watch-
          men, pastry cooks, valets are watching the rush of the
          wheelchairs without much interest.
          Then doors swing open, and we are in the tram It of the
          grand ballroom.2 INTO GRAND BALLROOMIt is a charity ball. The sign says "Shake for Highway
          Safety."' The wheelchairs and their occupants no longer
          interest us. They are the guests of honor, and people
          gather about them to arrange them appealingly, and we
          rush past the go-go band, the shakers, and the door
          prize, which is a little convertible, spinning endlessly
          on a pedestal.
          CAMERA reaches PETULIA, who is dancing with her husband,
          DAVID, but trying not to lose sight of ARCHIE. ARCHIE
          really wants to leave, but he is too polite to make it
          too obvious. As he bends over to put his punch cup on
          a table, he is bumped by the wheelchair of one of the
          guests of honor. He is not at all comfortable.02 CONTINUEDEIt's not easy for Petulia to keep an eye on Archie;
          gasping faces get in the ways hunks of twisting bodies
          get in the way, and the dance won't end. The music
          stops for a second, everyone sags and thinks, "Thank
          God it's over," but instantly the music begins again
          and everyone good naturedly swears, "Those crazy kids
          are trying to kill us," and meanwhile Petulia sees
          that Archie has reached the place where you get your
          coat.MED. ARCHIEHe is searching through his pockets for the ticket
          that will let him reclaim his coat. All the coats
          are in an incredible piles and in the semi-hysterical
          care of a debutante attendant.PETULIA' S VOICEYou can't leave
          He turns and sees Petulia.PETULIAYou're an official host.
          She nods to the ribbon and cardboard which along with
          'Official Host' says Dr. A. Bollen. Archie takes the
          ribbon off, as though to pin it on Petulia.PETULIACareful. Can you tell I'm not wearing
          a brassiere?ARCHIENo.PETULIADon't think about it. It will only
          excite you.
          Archie finally finds the ticket for his coat, which the
          attendant now tries to find. On through this Petulia
          continues.L`32 CONTINUEDPETULIAThat's my husband over there,ARCHIEAhh ...PETULIAI've been married six months and I've
          never had an affair,ARCHIEIt can happenPETULIADon't take it so bloody well. I've just
          turned you down. He's looking at us.
          My husband,MED. DAVID WITH HIS MOTHER AND FATHERsomewhere near the free whiskey table asking for Pernod,
          which, of course, they don't have.
          The father is watching the charity affair with utter
          disapproval. He tips a waiter by shoving a half-dozen
          raffle tickets into the waiter's jacket pocket,MR, DANNERI hope you win the car, sir,
          Mrs. Danner is charmed by her husband's generosity.
          She simply adores the man. David is busy not watching
          Archie and Petulia,PETULIA'S VOICEIsn't he gorgeous? He's a naval architect.
          It really zings when you say it. "My
          husband David is a naval architect."
          Actually, we're starving. You wouldn't
          want to buy a sixty foot sloop? David's
          "Momma"` and "Poppa' keep us. Look how
          disgusted Poppa is. He hates this sort
          of thing.0L2 CONTINUEDARCHIEIS VOICEPoppa is too sensitive.PETULIA'S VOICESensitive, my ass. He's bored. Highway
          safety's so blah. Also, he hates amateurs.
          Give him something he can sink his teeth
          into - "Rheumatoid Arthritis" ® "Muscular
          Dystrophy"' -m and he's the best there is.
          A real pro. A little lame girl with a
          ribbon in her hair and a crutch under her
          arm, and Poppa can set the world on fire.
          He's really slumming tonight.BARNEY'S VOICEHello, Archie.MED. PETULIA AND ARCHIEhave been joined by BARNEY and WILMA, Archie's best
          friends. Barney and Wilma are taking off their coats.
          Barney is already beginning to move to the music.
          0 Wilma is doing absolutely nothing but looking at
          Petulia.WILMAEverybody came late.ARCHIEI came early. G'bye Wilma. G'bye
          Barney.DEBUTANTE ATTENDANTCould you describe the coat?ARCHIEA. coat. A raincoat. Sleeves.
          Barney has begun to snap his fingers and move his shoulders,
          becoming part of "The Scene", about which Wilma couldn't
          care less.WILMAYou can't go, Archie. I'd be veryDISAPPOINTED02 CONTINUEDEArchie accepts this silently,WI LMAAlright, then. I won't tell you who
          I bumped into last weekARCHIEbuying a well larded rib roast.WILMASmarty. Have you seen what she's done
          to her hair?ARCHIEWild, huh?WILMAI said, "Polo, for heaven's sake, you
          look like a teenager."
          Archie doesn't seem too interested and, besides, all
          this is said while Wilma continues to look at Petulia.�WILMAYour Mike's getting so fat. Is that
          much weight good for a boy his age?ARCHIE(SHRUGGING)If it's alright for a rib roastWILMASmarty.
          Barney suddenly forgets the music to rescue his Vicuna
          coat which the debutante is smothering under other
          coats as she finally finds Archie's.W ILMA(to Petulia)
          I don't believe we've met.PETULIAScrew you, Wilma.ARCHIENow you've met.B2 CONTINUEDWilma moves off with Barney. Archie can't spend one
          more second with his coat. He simply puts it on, and
          turns to leave, walking toward the door.PETULIAMy name is Petulia,ARCHIEItm not surprised,PETULIAPolo's your wife,ARCHIEEx-wife, G' night.
          Petulia turns to face her husband David, who has taken a few
          steps toward her. She whirls around to face the departing
          Archie.PETULIAArchie!
          He turns, almost at the door.PETULIASay something warm.0ARCHIELike what?PETULIAI mean it
          There is something goofily desperate in her voice that
          stops him. He looks at her for awhile.ARCHIEYour hair, It gleams.PETULIA(DISAPPOINTED)Oh, Archie...ARCHIELeft arm or right? How do you brush it?PETULIALeft.ARCHIEAn hour a day.0 PETULIAAt least.02 CONTINUEDARCHIEYou' 11 have a problem. The bursa sheath.
          Very sensitive, Bursitis. It'll hurt.PETULIAI'll come to you.ARCHIEI wouldn't be able to help much. Just aspirin.PETULIAAnd sympathy?ARCHIESure._. PETULIAThank you, Archie. Damn it, how can I have an
          affair with an unmarried man. There has to be
          some equality of guilt.ARCHIEMy divorce doesn't become final till next�month.PETULIAI'll get my purse.
          But in turning to do so she sees David, then the
          spinning car, the door prize.PETULIAARCHIEWhat?PETULIAI've been told that I'll be the one to draw
          the winning ticket. I'm always picked for
          things like that. I radiate incorruptibility.
          Money can't buy me.
          She shakes her head, thoughtfully. During all this the door-
          man has been busily opening and closing the door for them as
          they keep changing their mind.PETULIAIt feels so super. Suddenly, all that love.83 EXT. BUS TERMINALAll we see is the wheel of a car resting on the back
          of a small boy, pinning him to the ground and people
          shocked, not knowing what to do.ARCHIE'S VOICEWell, stay then.L PETULIA'S IMAGE ENDS AND WE ARE BACK IN THE GRAND BALLROOMPETULIAArchie, why do you play this dumb game?
          This crappy pretense at resisting the
          beautiful lady? You're bloody lucky I'm
          even talking to you. How many kids do
          you have besides fat Mike?ARCHIESix.PETULIAG'night.ARCHIEActually, only one besides Mike.PETULIAMeet you outside.5 EXT. DREAM MOTEL NIGHTA motel sign: "Dream Motel."' A concrete oval, spiral-
          ling up four floors. You drive to your room and everything
          is geared to get you to bed electronically. But you must
          have a car, and Petulia and Archie have come by cab.
          Archie is paying the cabbie.PETULIA(to cabbie)
          You mustn't take it personal.
          (she indicates the "No Cabs" sign)
          Lucky we don't have luggage.ARCHIEDoes this trouble you?PETULIAA little.ARCHIEI suggested my place.PETULIA0I'd always imagined a tourist cabin, with
          paper thin walls, the sounds of a man from
          Tennessee in the cabin next door, sobbing
          endlessly, "M4ude, Maude, Maude 8 8"'91CONTINUEDArchie sees a car moving through the processes of
          E registration. Grabbing Petulia's hand, he starts to
          what is presumably the entrance -- at least it is the
          bottom of the ramp. They arrive at the booth and
          Archie steps on the. place marked 'Stand Here.' A
          T.V. screen lights up.MAN ON TVEvenin'. Where's your auto?
          Archie nods for Petulia to see the T.V. camera which
          is scanning them.PETU LIALost in a hailstorm this side of Pocatello,
          Idaho. Those hailstones really came down,
          didn't they, Zeke?MAN ON TVNo auto?ARCHIENo auto.MAN ON TVIt's a problem.0ARCHIEOnly if we make it one.PETULIADo you have any slides or swings for children?MAN ON TVNo, ma'am. You got kids?PETULIANo, no. I was told to be suspicious of
          motels which cater to the family trade.MAN ON TVThis isn't that sort of place. No auto.WELLThere is a small sound and a gadget reaches out which
          normally would fasten to the side of the car. On it is
          an electronic register, an electronic pen and a key with
          a great metal tag (as an example of how this might be
          designed, I recommend visiting a drive-in bank in Los
          Angeles). As Archie registers, and puts the ten dollar
          bill where it belongs, Petulia looks at the T.V. set.E10Ss ContinuedPETULIAYou've got a very nice T,V, face.MAN ON TVThank you, ma' amp,PETULIAYou have to use pancake make-up, things
          like that?MAN ON TV(a slight giggle)
          No, just be natural.
          Archie has finished registering and takes the keys.MAN ON TVWe've got an elevator but its just for going
          out for the paper and the like. I mean when
          you don't want to take the car. You'll have
          to use the ramp because of the key. It lets
          you know when you get to your room.INT. RAMPArchie and Petulia start up ramp.
          It's a long dark run and they are soon winded,ARCHIE(GASPING)CHARMINGPETULIA(GASPING)It shouldn't be charming. You're missing
          the whole point. It should be menacing .,,
          Another couple in a proper car, rushes by. There is
          a blaze of headlights, and a rush of sound.PETULIA,..gray . terribly distraught
           headlights of passing cars lighting up our
          room .,.
          Archie tugs at her, and gasps.0116 CONTINUEDPETULIA(CONTINUING)... a police car careening down the highway,
          sirens going full blast. And I plunge
          madly into your arms
          But she is now totally winded and cannot say another
          word. Archie reacts to a sudden phenomena: a tiny
          light on the key in his hand starts flicking on and off
          furiously. Just ahead of him is the door of their motel
          room. Archie is aghast at the pulsating key.ARCHIE(PLAINTIVELY)My apartment's only four blocks fromHERE7 INT. DREAM MOTEL ROOMStark is hardly the word but it will have to do. A
          control panel takes care of the drapes, T.V., stereo,
          announcements from the office, etc., etc., etc. There
          are mirrors everywhere and the first thing Petulia
          does is establish contact between the vanity mirror,
          the mirror on the bathroom door and the medicine cabinet
          mirror so that she is reflected endlessly.PETULIAYou have 624 women in this room and
          I'm still counting.
          Archie moves behind her and begins unbuttoning the top
          buttons on the back of her dress.PETULIA(HARSHLY)Just wait a minute, okay?
          Archie plops on the bed in his coat, a most iropic smile
          on his face -- he is beginning to suspect he is not
          going to get laid. Petulia is examining all the Petulia
          faces in the mirrors.PETULIAMy great-grandmother is ninety-one and
          still has a granite chin.
          Archie pushes a gadget beside the bed and it begins to
          vibrate. Petulia sees endless Archies vibrating on
          endless beds.127 CONTINUEDPETULIAWhat a lecherous lotARCHIEShe's ninety-ones eh?PETULIABut no fun.ARCHIENot at ninety-one, hellPETULIAShe stopped having fun at twenty-eight when her
          husband was killed in the first war, in a
          trench looking just like Cary Grant with a
          waxed moustache. She can't remember him but
          she does remember Cary Grant because he is
          from Bristol, too, and often in the news. If
          his picture is in the paper he gets a waxed
          moustache whether he likes it or not.
          She turns to face Archie. She is afraid and she is
          angry and she doesn-t know quite what to do from one
          moment to the next. But she knows he shouldn't be in an
          overcoat jiggling on a jiggling bed,�PETULIAStop being so damn casual.
          Archie sits up but is still casual,PETULIAWe're about �td become lovers, Did you bring
          an instrument, Archie?ARCHIEEh?PETULIARing for room service. Ask the robot for
          something splendid and musical,,ARCHIESaxophone? Electric Organ? Tuba?PETULIAA tuba. Absolutely; Bless you, Ar--hie; A
          tuba; Something large and twirly and pom
           to pom .pomX Archie, this is an event. We
          0 are about to become lovers.7 CONTINUEDARCHIEYou said that.PETULIAIt can't be said often enough.ARCHIEAre we?PETULIAAre we what?ARCHIEAbout to become lovers?PETULIANo.ARCHIEAh, you swinging young marrieds.
          He leaves.8 EXT. ROOM0Across from the ramp there is the elevator the man on
          T.V. mentioned. Archie is already there waiting for it
          to arrive. Petulia starts toward him angrily.PETULIAWhere do you have to rush? If we were making
          love you would be exploring my navel about now.
          Time would be the last thing on your mind.
          An old man in a bathrobe, sadly out of contrast with
          the electronic motel, looks up from the open trunk of
          his car. The elevator doors open. Petulia and Archie
          enter,9 INT. ELEVATORThe elevator doors shut and inside the elevator a
          loud speaker begins playing a medley of San Francisco
          songs.PETULIAYou. look like a gargoyle. Poor, dumb Archie.
          I'm all mixed up sexually. Old Mum's a
          prostitute. The oldest professional lady in
          0 all Bristol. Mavis, too, my sister. But
          I mean she's not a landmark yet.9 CONTINUEDDuring this Archie notices that the back of Petulia's
          dress remains unbuttoned. He moves behind her and
          begins rebuttoning her. At the touch of his hand,
          something happens to Petulia.10 INT. FIRST AID ROOMArchie's hands are holding a little boy under the bright
          lights of a first aid table. The boy is a bloody mess but
          Archie's hands are soothing him even as they so gently
          prod, examining his injuries. Nurses are cutting the boy's
          bloody jeans off him, an expensive watch falls to the
          floor, they retrieve it.11 INT. ELEVATORPetulia's head presses against Archie's hand. She
          kisses it, she rubs her cheek against it.
          The elevator has come to a stop and the doors have opened.
          Archie sees Petulia's tears on his hand.ARCHIEReal honest-to-God tears, Petulia?PETULIATears, Archie.0ARCHIEPetulia, you're a kook.
          He exits the elevator and whistles at a cruising cab.12 EXT. DREAM MOTELArchie crosses to the cab and opens the door. He hustles
          Petulia inside the cab.ARCHIEIf he gets you there in time, you can still
          pick the winning ticket and make somebody happy.PETULIA(very quietly)
          Archie, I'm going to marry you.
          The cab pulls away and Archie sees Petulia looking at him
          through the rear window. Archie allows himself the
          drollest of smiles.ARCHIEIt's the Pepsi generation
          0 He walks into the night alone.15E 12 Continued
          A jalopy full of dizzy dames with "LOVE" painted in
          huge awkward letters on its side almost runs him
          down. Archie continues in the night.
          Now, we can see the Golden Gate Bridge.13 EXT. DANNER HOUSE DAWNThe house is on the edge of the sea and a cliff rises
          behind it. Petulia is going up the open lift which
          climbs the cliff. It is a very different Petulia.
          She hurts.INT. ARCHIE'S BEDROOM MORNINGArchie is sleeping. There is the SOUND of a bell
          ringing. After awhile Archie's hand reaches out for
          the phone.ARCHIE(into phone)
          I'm up, thanks.
          Then his dizzy brain realizes the ringing is continuing
          and is constant. He sees the alarm clock, 6:1 He
          stumbles and staggers to the front door.ARCHIEYeah... yeah 000 yeah 000
          He opens the door to come face to face with the large
          and twirly front end of a tuba. The tuba is stark
          white for no particular reason.14A EXT. ARCHIE'S APARTMENTWe see some of the hall, a yawning milkman, etc., but
          mostly Petulia and the tuba.14B INT. ARCHIE'S APARTMENTDazedly,.Archie steps back to make room for Petulia
          and the tuba.ARC HIEI'll make some coffee.
          Petulia blows with all her strength, emitting a sad
          little peep, then collapses to the floor, tuba and all.1614B ContinuedPETULIAAren't I a kook? If you think you'reSURPRISEDARCHIE(at the same time)
          No, I've been up for hours, waiting for

           the pawnshop is going to be when he sees
          all that broken glass.14C EXT. PAWN SHOPA brick smashes the glass, scattering cameras, mandolins,
          etc. in the midst of which is the white tuba.PETULIA'S VOICEArchie, how come the burglar alarm didn't
          go off?14D INT. ARCHIE'S APT.0 The scene continues.PETULIAWherets it all going to end if the
          burglar alarms won't go off? Take me
          to bed, Archie,ARCHIEGet the hell out of here . please.
          He reaches to help Petulia to her feet but as he touches
          her waist to lift her, she screams and faints,15 INT. HALLWAY OF DANNER HOUSE NIGHTBut we don't know it's the Danner house. All we see is
          Petulia crumpling as she is struck. She hits the floor
          and just lies there, not making a sound.
          (Also SHOOT in slow motion.)16 INT. ARCHIE' S APARTMENTArchie breaks an ammonia ampule under Petulia's nose.
          Her head wrenches away and she opens her eyes. Archie
          has begun to prod her side; she is in pain.1716 CONTINUEDPETULIAI've got a broken rib, I think, I can
          feel it broken, Archie.ARCHIEDon't you know you can puncture a lungePETULIAHopping around with tubas and stuff --

          in pajama bottoms,ARCHIEGet your clothes off,PETULIAAs a woman, not as a rib.
          Archie is harassed. The phone begins ringing. He grabs
          it angrily.ARCHIE(into phone)

          them obediently,PETULIAYou've got a super build for a man your age.
          Archie says nothing. He crosses to the bathroom and

          of sickening, Archie.
          Archie stops his dressing long enough to gaze at this girl
          in his bed, beyond which is an overturned tuba. Archie
          sighs somewhat philosophically, not nearly as amused as
          you'd think.17 INT. HOSPITALWe are in the examining room of the orthopedic ward.
          Archie is working on Oliver, the little Mexican boy of�seven whom we have seen earlier as a bloody mess in the
          flashback. Now, Oliver is healing nicely, but it's still
          not pleasant to be examined. A woman hovers in the back-
          ground. A nurse assists Archie. Oliver is a brave, solemn
          little boy, with shadows of fatigue around his eyes. He
          is also a tough little bastard, let me tell you. He is
          now wearing the broken gold watch; though to fit his
          skinny wrist the band has been tied in a knot,ARCHIEI want him here every day. For therapy.WOMANSi, Yes, doctor. I do,

          necessary scatological and sexual phrases that would be
          necessary in his line of business.ARCHIEEvery day. Tell him that.

          pattern over the patient's drab, withered body. In the
          control area Archie and Barney listen to the strange sounds
          emanating from the computer, each sound again indicating a
          physical condition. The patient's room looks like a comfy
          hotel room: wood paneling, couches, magazines, plants.

          The patient can no longer be seen. He is draped in plastic

          has just awakened, is wearing his pajama bottoms and
          is hairy, sweaty and fat.
          Petulia obviously knows tlleiman, nods hello, to which
          the man answers a non-committal grunt. He squeezes
          past Petulia to drink from the sink. He sticks his

          By now, Archie is on top of Polo, and out of habit she
          is adjusting her body for him.3532B ContinuedPOLOHe lives in such a depressing, rented
          room. It gives me claustrophobia.ARCHIEPoor Polo.POLOIt's such an icky little room.
          Archie is, perhaps, two seconds away from entering Polo,
          when he suddenly sits up, wondering what the hell he's
          been doing. He walks to the far side of the room,
          sticks his shirt in, wipes the sleeve of his shirt
          across his face.
          Polo feels no particular rancor, the entire thing was
          totally unplanned, and she has no more desire to
          "make it" with Archie than he has with her. She pulls
          down her skirt and adjusts her garters.ARCHIETell the kids I'll come for them
          0 Sunday at eight.POLOThey'll be ready. I thought the
          decent thing was to come here and
          talk in a civilized manner. About
          the change in my situation.ARCHIEI appreciate it, Polo.POLOGood night, Archie.ARCHIEYou've got a run in your stocking.
          Polo exits, Archie can't figure out why in the world
          he even thought of making love to Polo after all this
          time. He sits down on the unmade bed, finds one of
          Polo's cookies on the sheets, and pops it into his
          mouth.33. EXT. TEA GARDEN DAY0 It's a busy Saturday and everything is lovely. A3633 CONTINUEDLARGE GUARD with a bull horn is keeping people moving
          on the Japanese bridge. Many soldiers on pass, a few
          hippies, but mostly just tourists.LARGE GUARD(with bull horn)
          Now you folks keep moving along that
          bridge. You keep moving along and give
          other folks a chance. There's lots of
          pretty things to do. You keep moving
          right along. You won't want to forget

          During this, MAY and Archie talk.
          '.s 32 and pretty. Its a nice day but Archie is
          not happy. Polo, Warren, maybe Petulia mostly it's
          kind of a lousy day to be a bachelor, . and May have
          been sitting on the grass. Gracefully she rises to
          her feet, doing everything just right, even this.
          0 She puts away her portable martini kit.ARCHIENobody in the world can sit on the

          better than he does.ARCHIETell me about Bobby Kennedy.

          I've never seen one of those ... your
          rubber mannequins .. I've never once
          seen the pipe sticking out of their
          bottoms. Not once, not one damn time.
          That bothers me, May.
          May stops. She doesn1t know whether to be annoyed or
          amused. Shets a little of both.ARCHIEI'm not hostile, it's frustration.
          In all that perfection, how could a
          clumsy clot like me possibly be
          fitted in? I mean, without spoiling
          the whole effect.
          They have now reached the area of the stunted trees.
          Nuns are passing through empty benches; kids are
          improvising on the stage and shouting.MAYDon't worry about it. You'll be
          going back to Polo.ARCHIENo, she's found a fellah.MAYOh.

          the parking lot for Archie's car.34 EXT. STEPS OF ARCHIE' S APARTMENT DAYPetulia waits on the steps. When she is not being observed,
          when she is not "on," there are moments when Petulia seems
          utterly forlorn. This is such a moment. But then she sees
          Archie and May and instantly she is "with it."ARCHIEWell of all people.PETULIAAll that crap about the humanitarian-
          ism of the medical profession.
          She darts alongside the building and begins frantically
          calling to a little old man in white duck pants and an
          "aloha" hat,
          May looks at Archie questioningly.ARCHIEDon't ask.
          Petulia and the old man are back joining Archie and May

          this.400 35 INT. ARCHIE'S APARTMENT DAYMr. Howard is casually testing the valves on the tuba.MR . HOWARDShe said there was this elderly lady whose
          first husband used to play tuba with John
          Phillip Sousa. She said it would cheer
          her up and make her want to live. She
          gave me five bucks.ARCHIE(looking at Petulia)
          All that broken glassMR. HOWARD(finished with the tuba)
          Its okay.
          Archie crosses to the front door and opens it.ARCHIEGoodbye, Mr. Howard. Goodbye, Petulia.
          Petulia crosses to Mr. Howard and presses a dollar bill
          into his shirt pocket.�PETULIATake a taxi. You can at least say
          you're sorry, Archie.ARCHIEI'm sorry, Mr, Howard. Goodbye, Petulia.
          But Petulia just sits on the edge of a chair tapping
          her fingers in annoyance. Mr. Howard leaves. The door
          remains open for Petulia to leave. May watches Petulia
          in amused tolerance.ARCHIEWhat's the next move, Petulia?PETULIAI'd like to discuss your irresponsibility.
          People are passing in the hallway, peering in.ARCHIEGoodbye, Petulia.

          a kook. We are going to be married.PETULIAArchie, when you try to sound cool and
          "with it," you're really pathetic.
          We're trying to have an intelligent
          conversation...ARCHIEAbout what?PETULIAWell, about Polo, among other things.ARCHIEPolo is none of your damned business.PETULIAThat's dumb. Dumb. She's my business
          and she's this lady's business. I
          happen to hate Polo.ARCHIE(to May)
          Needless to say she's never even met Polo.PETULIAI look at you and I know Polo.
          (to Map)
          Explain that to him.
          May looks at Archie in bewilderment, she is not quite sure
          how to react; but when she makes up her mind it will be
          the exactly right reaction. Also, in all truth, Petulia
          is frightened by May.PETULIAHow many years were you married., Archie?
          Eight? Ten? Anyhow, the best, Wasted.
          Gone down the drain.ARCHIEOh, come on ..oPETULIAArchie, we are from two different worlds.
          We've got nothing to agree on. Except one
          thing. You're a lonely screwed up mess.

          a very special man.420 35 CONTINUEDARCHIEOh, God.PETULIATell him, May.
          Petulia doesn't like May's amused reaction.PETULIAYou don't think so?MAYI won't put Archie on a pedestal. He'll do.PETULIA(ANGRY)You've got yourself another winner, Archie.MAY(to Archie)

          I really don't want to see you anymore.
          Archie's voice is cold. Petulia is suddenly defeated,
          mostly by May. She gets up and leaves.36 INT. HOSPITAL NIGHTIt's after 3 a.m. and Archie is hollow-eyed and drenched
          0 with sweat from an emergency operation. He is with a
          patient in the recovery room, obviously concerned about43i 36 Continued
          the patient's chances. He crosses to a sink, bathes his
          face and hands with cold water. He is exhausted. As we
          sometimes glimpse Petulia when no one else is looking
          and see beyond the kookiness, so for an instant we see
          beyond Archie's look of professional assurance and see
          the fearful uncertainty. He now moves into the corridor,
          with each step assuming the doctor's look that is expected
          of him.PETULIA'S VOICEHi.
          Archie turns. Petulia is in the medical library with
          books scattered all about her.ARCHIEYou're kidding.PETULIAI think I've discovered a cure for cancer.ARCHIEWell, if you're on the brink of something.
          How did they let you in.�She joins him.PETULIAYou look exhausted.ARCHIEDo you know it's almost three? Doesn't
          Mr. Danner worry at all about things like that?
          Petulia looks at him reverently.PETULIA(TENDERLY)Look at you.
          Archie is so unaccustomed to hearing a straight line
          from Petulia that her tone and look of tenderness stop
          him for a moment. Then, without a word, they fall into
          step beside each other, leaving the hospital.37 EXT. PARKING LOT NIGHTAt this time of night hardly a car remains. Archie's car
          is quite by itself.037 CONTINUEDARC HIEShall I drop you off?

          She gets in.38 INT . CARARCHIEPetulia, you've got to stop following
          me around like this.
          Petulia is absolutely silent but her eyes are devouring
          him with infinite tenderness which Archie is finding
          very touching. It is a facet of Petulia he has never
          seen before.ARCHIEWhere to? I could use a steak sandwich.
          There's a jazz joint that stays open
          all night.
          He reaches to start the car just as she grabs at him,
          • awkwardly, aggressively.ARCHIE(SURPRISED)Hey, come on ®m why this sudden
          Petulia is relentless and voracious. Her hands and mouth
          are everywhere on Archie. A car is a lousy bedroom but
          it will have to do. Heads bump against windows, elbows
          jam against steering wheels, but Petulia will not be
          stopped. Finally, Archie grips her shoulders and forces
          her to stop.ARCHIENo.PETULIAYes.ARC HIENot here.39 INT. SUPERMARKET PRE-DAWNThough the streets outside are deserted, the supermarket
          is jammed with people. Archie is pushing a market
          • basket already piled high with groceries while Petulia
          keeps finding things to buy. Archie knows that Petulia
          is going through this massive shopping spree simply to
          get even for his rejection of the moment she chose to
          make love.45• 39 ContinuedARCHIEIt m not really hungry.PETULIAI'm starving.ARCHIEAm I being punished?PETULIALoganberry jam ... we'll have a case.ARCHIEI'd rather have a new plastic raincoat.PETULIAYou don't save anything on plastic raincoats.ARCHIEShall I get another cart? Polo can fill

          basket of groceries. There is no one else on the street.
          In front of the market is a clown on a pedestal gesticu-
          lating with arms and mouth at people who are not there,
          but making no sound. Petulia quizzically looks up at the
          silent violent clown, while Archie waits for her at the
          car. Finally he taps the horn and she turns and looks at
          him. She starts running toward the car, suddenly wanting
          0 very much to be with him. They kiss lightly.469 41 INT. ARCHIE'S BEDROOM NIGH'Archie is sound asleep, breathing heavily. Petulia sits
          wrapped in a blanket on the floor near the window, her
          head resting on the sill, lonely.42 TNT. ARCHIE'S BEDROOM NIGHTPetulia is sound asleep. Through the open bedroom door
          we see Archie drinking a lonesome Coke.43 INT. ARCHIES BEDROOM NIGHTPetulia and Archie are both in the bed, asleep and
          somehow as far apart as two human beings can be.44 INT. ARCHIE'S BEDROOM NIGHTIn the midst of her sleep, Petulia begins jabbering in
          some language all her own. Archie Is eyes open and he
          looks at her and he smiles. Still sound asleep,
          Petulia finishes her statement, whatever the hell it
          was and settles down on the pillow. Archie looks at her.
          She wakes up. They look at each other so gravely that
          they both begin to smile. Neither one is having the
          best night of their life but both are aware of a sense
          • of tenderness that has caught them unexpectedly.
          45 INT. ARCHIEtS BEDROOM MORNING
          Petulia wakes up suddenly. Though she is nude under the
          sheets, Archie is fully dressed for his day with the
          boys. Though his clothes are very sporty he looks
          anything but sporty as he talks quietly into the phone-ARCHIE(into phone)

          During this series of dumb, ordinary telephone conversa-�tions to follow,, we begin seeing the moments which have
          brought on Petulia's current crisis with Oliver.48 INT. BULL RING TIJUANAIt's a hot summer afternoon. Petulia and David have
          driven down from San Francisco. They are members of the
          "San Francisco Matador Club". David has drunk too much
          wine from his bota bag and the sour wine and the hot sun
          have made him violently ill. Though there are still two
          bulls left to kill, David and Petulia are leaving. As she
          moves down the spindly stairway, Petulia becomes aware of
          Oliver. He is with a gang of other kids at the butcher
          shed where the previous bulls are being dressed for market.
          They are all soaking banderillos in blood so they can be
          sold as "the real thing" .49 EXT. A STREET IN TIJUANAPetulia and David in their convertible. David has passed
          out in the back seat and Petulia is having a hell of a
          time trying to move the car out of the parking space.
          Again kids swarm about her like wild animals, trying to
          sell hats, cushions, gum, pottery, etc. Again she sees
          Oliver among them (or is it another kid who looks like
          0 Oliver?) ,5040 50 EXT. BORDER GATE AT TIJUANA LATE AFTERNOONThousands of cars are waiting to get through. Hot, noisy,
          dusty, unbearable. Kids storm every car, hustling their
          captured audience. Among them is Oliver. Have the others
          been Oliver? In Petulia's exhaustion and discomfort, the
          heat, the flies, the blaring horny she can't be sure.
          (NOTE, All through the Tijuana scenes, we HEAR Archie
          and Petulia's telephone conversation. It is utterly banal
          and they know it and are amused by its banality.)
          PETULIA: I was dozing.
          ARCHIE: That's good.
          PETULIA: You left without having breakfast.
          ARCHIE: I had a cup of coffee on the way.
          PETULIA: A cup of coffee. You should have had
          eggs or waffles.

          ARCHIE: Yes?
          PETULIA: You won't forget to phone.51 EXT. WHARFArchie hangs up the phone and starts running with his sons

          nothing phone conversation.52 EXT. BOAT DECKChildren run scurrying around the mildly crowded deck.

          boat where the radar and electronic equipment are kept.
          Archie is on the ship telephone. He is trying to keep
          a straight face but since he is obviously talking to Petulia,
          it is difficult.• MIKE :(to another kid)
          Doctors can do things like that. Call
          their patients from wherever they are.
          Archie finishes the call and returns to them, smiling.5253 CONTINUEDARCHIEHow about clams on the wharf when we get back?MIKEClams make Steve vomit.ARCHIEOh.MIKEYou forgot that.ARCHIENo, it just slipped my mind.
          Archie really does like his kids but his thoughts are
          somewhere else.54 INT. A FISH PLACE ON THE WHARFWhile Mike and Stevie are gorging themselves, Archie
          is at the wall telephone.ARCHIE• Hello there.LATE AFTERNOON55 EXT. THE BORDER GATE AT TIJUANADuring this silent scene we watch Oliver seduce Petulia
          into giving him a lift in her convertible. Petulia is
          so bored as the cars take hours to get past the gate,
          Oliver is an absolute scoundrel. David is such a clod,
          passing out in the back seat, his legs hanging out over
          the door of the car, one sandal missing. His beautiful
          face is somehow an obscene parody of itself, fiery
          red from the sun.
          Oliver mimics David, Petulia, the guard at the gate,
          dances, skips, romps, annoys Petulia, makes her laugh,
          dares her, goads her. Finally, when Petulia's car is
          just one away from the border guard, Oliver impudently
          hops into the seat beside her, expecting to be thrown
          out but also expecting maybe a nickel in the bargain.
          But the joke's on Oliver. Petulia is even kookier than
          he is. Is it the look of David that sickens her? Is
          it her annoyance at having to wait so long and do the
          driving while he lies collapsed and useless? Is it
          that "useless" that goads her?5355 CONTINUEDMost of all Petulia is doing something of absolutely no
          importance; she knows Oliver will hop out of the car the
          moment they reach the guard. All it amounts to is two
          kooks having a few seconds of horsing around.
          The joke is on both of them -- the guard, harassed by
          the honking of thousands of cars and having fully
          inspected the car just ahead of Petulia, waves the
          convertible on through.
          Petulia stops the car a few hundred yards past the
          border to let Oliver climb out, but he just sits there.
          Petulia thinks, "okay, you little bastard . " and
          zooms down the highway, intending to stop at the first
          moment the look of superior arrogance leaves Oliver's
          tough little face.
          During this we hear Archie and Petulia's second tele-
          phone conversation which is as blab and loving as before.
          ARCHIE: Hi, there.
          PETULIA: Hello.
          ARCHIE: I'm having lunch with the boys.
          PETULIA: You eat a good lunch, Archie,
          ARCHIE: I will, I will.
           PETULIA: You only had a cup of coffee for breakfast.
          ARCHIE: I'll eat a good lunch, Petulia.
          PETULIA: Like what?
          ARCHIE: Petulia, they have a thousand different
           things on the menu.
          PETULIA: You should have a sirloin steak with french
          fries or baked beans.
          ARCHIE: Okay.
          PETULIA: That's easy to say, Archie, But I know you.
          ARCHIE: Steak with french fries or baked beans.
          PETULIA: Do they have fresh sea-food?
          ARCHIE: Yes.
          PETULIA: Sea bass is nice.
          ARCHIE: Yes, sea bass is great.
          PETULIA: If they grill it,
          ARCHIE: I'll have grilled sea bass.
          PETULIA: Unless they do a nice omelet.
          ARCHIE: I'm sure they would if I asked.
          PETULIA: It's such a problem.
          ARCHIE: Yes, I know. Goodbye, Petulia.
          PETULIA: Phone.56 INT. FISH PLACEArchie laughingly hangs up. He goes back to his kids.540 57 EXT. FORT WINFIELD SCOTT DAYThe sign says all the dreadful penalty of being caught

          Archie chases them through the floors.
          Archie sees a telephone above which is a sign which
          says that this phone is for the military and is to be
          used only in emergency. Archie approaches it warily,
          then loses his nerve and turns back to his kids.
          Archie wants to get back to Petulia.58 EXT. FORT BARRACK FLOORS DAYARCHIEAlright?

          • about Petulia waiting in his apartment, and feels pretty
          damn good about the whole thing. He opens the door of
          his apartment. He is carrying a bag of Mexican paper flowers60 INT. APARTMENTIt is empty. Archie knows at once that Petulia is gone.
          All the joy goes out of him. The apartment is a mess.
          The television set is on: a program without sound of
          soldiers fighting. Archie is so disappointed that
          Petulia isn't here. He angrily flips the dial getting
          the same type of program.ARCHIEA nice, neat kid.
          After all the exuberance he feels so empty. Everywhere
          things are scattered about.61 INT. BEDROOMThe bedroom is the worst of all. The sheets and blanket
          have literally been stripped from the bed and flung pall
          mall onto the floor behind. Archie really is annoyed.
          Then he stops, he crosses slowly to the tangle of sheets
          and blanket on the floor. A lifeless arm protrudes.
          Archie crumples to his knees and tears at the blankets.
          Petulia is broken, bloodied and seemingly dead.5761 CONTINUEDTh�-, phone is off the hook. Archie doesn't know where to
          turn first. He feels Petulia's throat for a pulse, isn't
          sure she has one,
          Petulia is wearing his hooded sweatshirt from Se. 23.
          Archie attempts heart massage, but Petuliats so taped up
          from the broken rib that this is impossible.
          Archie presses his mouth over Petulia's to attempt to get
          her breathing again. He tries this only for an instant
          then crosses to the phone, hangs it up and dials an
          emergency number.
          Archie goes back to Petulia. He feels again for a pulse
          in her throat, can find no pulse. He begins trembling.
          As always when a crisis really happens, it isn't as easy
          as the Red Cross advertisements say. Her mouth won't
          open right. His mouth seems unable to make the connection
          with hers. It all looks more like very bad love-making
          than a life-saving procedure.62 INT./EXT. HALLWAY & STEPS OUTSIDE ARCH IE' S APARTMENTTwo special officers are moving Petulia down a hallway on0a stretcher. A third walks behind her pressing a rubber
          oxygen mask over her mouth.
          We feel Sunday late afternoon rudely shattered, but limp-
          ing along nevertheless. Television, cokes, sex, stereo,
          facials, isometric exercises. funny-papers, ailments;
          boring endless Sunday late afternoon -- suddenly bloodied.
          Doors are opening up and down the hallway. People come
          out to stare. A big friendly old sheepdog wild with
          enthusiasm, leaps at the stretcher and almost topples
          Petulia. Archie, smeared with Petulia's blood, his
          shirt-tails out, in a state of shock himself, whams the
          dog as hard as he can. This entire sequence should
          seem like a nightmare.
          The dog's owner goes berserk.DOG'S OWNERDon't you hit Lennie!
          Archie is too distressed about Petulia to even respond.
          At every door there is a tenant. A jumble of voices all
          spoken together.1ST TENANT0 That's sex for you.2ND TENANTIt could be a gas leak.5862 CONTINUED0 3RD TENANTShe's dead.4TH TENANTThose rescue cops never give up.5TH TENANTYes'. but they're all racists.
          Of course, one of the officers is a Korean and the other
          a Negro. All through this we have also been aware of many
          T.V. sets, all with programs with various kinds of violence.
          One youbgster comes to the door holding a portable T.V. and
          we see on the tube war casualties being flown out of the
          Jungle by helicopters.
          Archie has crossed ahead of the special officers to lead
          the way down the steps. Half a dozen "hippies"' loaded
          down with Chinese food and a yellow guitar are coming up
          the steps. Everything is chaos.
          The officers just can't manage the stretcher down the
          narrow stairway. Poor Petulia is twisted and turned every
          which way - all in the name of saving her life.7TH TENANT�(a rich old queen in
          purple Bermuda shorts)
          I had trouble like that with my piano. Two
          hundred dollars to bring it through the window.
          And its never been the same.
          A record player is playing a Herb Alpert recording and
          the stretcher seems to move along to its rhythm.63 EXT. A HIGHWAY RESTAURANT NIGHTThis is the stretch of highway 1 - 01 going north from.Mexico.
          The restaurant is a mass of neon, and does very well in,the
          hot coffee department as the sleepy travellers take a
          break on their way north.
          Among the cars many are filled with bull fight
          afficianados.
          It's about ten p.m. There is a general feeling of
          exhaustion and spent passions. People are bleary-eyed,
          recovering from hangovers, beginning to feel the effects
          of sunburns. All this we see later. First we see Oliver.
          Oliver is sitting in the car staring coldly at David who
          0 has just awakened. David is probably just about to say
          "Who the hell are you" when Petulia appears carrying a
          cardboard carton of coffee and orange juice.5963 CONTINUEDDavid takes a sip of coffee. Oliver grabs at the orange
          juice, toppling it, spilling some of it on the seat but
          saving most. He gulps it down then uses the straw to
          make bubbles. David looks at Oliver and then at
          Petulia, all through the bubbles.PETULIASay hello to "Petulia"s Folly."
          David says nothing.DAVIDOh?PET ULIA(with careful wit)
          If, in the past, you thought me a bit odd,
          feast your eyes on this little goodie.DAVIDWhat°s the problem?PETULIA(to Oliver)
          Why can't you speak English?
          (to David)

          getting uneasy.O LIVERLady say "hey come on us go San Francisco
          ten bucks."PET UL IAYou bleeding little liar!
          Oliver looks at Petulia innocently.PETULIA(CONTINUING)I never did!
          She's worried about David.600 63 CONTINUEDPETULIAWhat I said to this malicious little fink was
          that maybe one day if we went back to Tijuana --DAVIT?(to Oliver)

          Oliver.
          They begin laughing again. Petulia is becoming
          t.
          completely unnerved.610 63 CONTINUEDPETULIADavid. The San Diego bus is due at twelve

          ally.DAVID(to Petulia)
          Get in. It's still a long drive. We'll
          never get home.PETULIAOkay. He can wait inside. The cashier's a

          the ckeeky little bugger!
          0 She opens the car door to take Oliver out, tense,
          wanting to get past this moment but fearful that she won't.DAVIDYou promised "Oliver" "San Francisco."PETULIAI did not.DAVIDLike hell you didn't'.
          David abruptly hops over the seat and sits behind the
          wheel. He signals for Petulia to get in beside Oliver.
          Petulia hesitates.DAVIDI dig, bitch, I dig!
          She's stunned. His hand reaches out and brutally jerks
          her into the car.DAVIDI dig.
          CAMERA HOLDS on Petulia's frightened face. Now suddenly
          0 the face has a tube in the nose; there's another tube in
          her throat; and she's unconscious.620 6L!. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM HOSPITALHalf a dozen people are working to keep Petulia alive.
          They're used to their work, it's no big deal for them.
          Actually the feeling should be that they're as relaxed
          as if they were mechanics working on a motor car.
          Archie sits on a white stool in a corner, watching
          everything, not as a doctor any more but as a"deeply
          involved man. When one of the doctors hits a vein by
          mistake and murmurs "Whoops ." Archie can take no
          more and leaves.65 INT. DOCTORS' SHOWER ROOMArchie sits on a little stone shelf, just letting the
          water from the shower hit him.BARNEY'S VOICEHey you.

          recent holiday with Wilma and their daughter. Each
          slide projects an enormous colored image against an
          entire wall. Archie is slumped on a couch popping
          peanuts into his mouth.BARNS YYou like this new lens, Archie? Is

          Through this Barney keeps changing slides. Suddenly there
          is a picture of Archie, Polo and Wilma on another vacation.
          In this slide they are posing in corny T-shirts. The

          protruding from arms and neck. She is still unconscious.
          Archie is awakened by a nun entering the cubicle to
          hook up another pint of blood. Archie's presence
          disconcerts the nun. She can't show her annoyance
          openly, but is so disturbed she does her work badly
          this time.NUNWho would do such a thing to a girl like

          orthopaedic problem, Dr. Bollen?0Archie doesn't answer.NUNA. doctor should get his sleep.ARCHIEYou left the needle in.
          The nun would like to scream at Archie about the
          impropriety of his presence here but she can't.

          She leaves. Archie moves closer to Petulia examining
          her throat and eyes for vital signs. He pushes open an
          eyelid and Petulia's dead eye stares glassily into his
          living face.68 INT. HOSPITAL DAYWe spend awhile watching Archie function as a doctor,
          moving through the wards, examining broken legs, arms,
          or whatever. In one of these scenes we pass through
          the orthopaedic room.69 INT. ORTHOPAEDIC ROOMOliver is being given therapy in a whirling bath. He's
          only one of some twenty patients and Archie barely
          notices him, simply waving to him as he does to other
          patients who don't need his care anymore. Oliver is
          too frightened of the whirling bath to give a damn
          about the doctor. Archie goes and we stay with Oliver.06869 CONTINUEDOLIVER'S ATTENDANTCome on, come on, get on with it.70 INT. A SMALL BEDROOM IN THE DANNER HOUSEJUST BEFORE DAWNThree weeks ago. Oliver is wide awake, wolfing down a
          loaf.of bread that he has stolen from the Danner kitchen.
          As he gnaws on the bread, he listens to indistinct
          sounds from the master bedroom. moans and groans,
          a sudden cry, all of which he supposes are the sounds
          of love-making. He grins to himself in the dark.
          Abruptly a door opens and Petulia is coming down the
          hall. She has hastily put on a pair of slacks and a
          blouse, and is struggling into a coat. Her hair is
          tousled, her face filled with anguish.71 INT. STAIRWAY DANNER HOUSEPetulia is hurriedly taking the hurriedly dressed
          Oliver down the steps. He is protesting. Before they
          can reach the front door, the door of the master
          bedroom opens. David is standing there in his
          pyjama pants.DAVIDHey, "San Francisco"!
          He pronounces it like Oliver does. He comes down
          the steps, three at a time. He stops before the kid.DAVID(GENTLY)I sure hope there's no hard feelings.
          Oliver understands none of this, and of course David
          knows this, but it doesn't stop him.DAVIDIt isn't a question of hospitality, I
          want you to understand that. I feel
          terrible. Dragging you all the way

          Right?PETUL IADavid, for God's sakes
          The wrist watch is much too big for Oliver's skinny
          wrist so David starts to fasten it around Oliver's
          biceps. Even this is too skinny so David starts
          fastening it around Oliver's lower leg. Oliver
          has no idea what is happening, but his hustler's
          heart tells him he is being given something very
          valuable. Petulia is repelled.DAVID(to Oliver)

          an old car without wheels, butane tanks, other junk but no
          sign of life. Archie knocks on the back door and finally
          the door is opened. Beyond the screen door is the Mexican

          mo'rnin'g. Petulia waits with Oliver who is very annoyed at
          what has been done to him. A few other early travelers are
          about.- As the bus comes into sight, Oliver, grasping his last
          chance of freedom, suddenly darts away. IN A SERIES OF
          FLASHES we see Oliver; hit by a car; the look of agony on
          Petuliaa's face; the reaction of the spectators; and finally
          the ultimate image: the boy pinned under the wheel.MR.. DANNER'S VOICE(during preceding scene)
          David and I went at it hot and heavy.
          About the value of psychiatry. I mean
          sensible psychiatry. None of that "Sex-
          is-the-reason-for-everything" junk. It
          E won't ever replace a visit to the wood-
          shed and a good whack across the backside,
          but its late in the old ball game for that.8281 JN 7-1 o PETULIA'S HOSPITAL ROOM NIGHT
          • The nun reappears.NUNI'm sorry Sir, but it's time for the
          lady's medication.MR. DANNERDoes anyone ever report how filthy
          this room is?
          He loses all his aplomb, He squats, he points, he finds
          imaginary objects on the floor.MR, DANNERLook at this'. Look at this! I
          personally raised fifty thousand
          dollars for this Hospital during
          the last campaign. You didn't
          know that did you; Well ask Mr,
          Pearl'. I mean if you knew what
          he looked like'. Filthy'.
          He gets up to go, The nun leaves, Mr. Danner brushes
          imaginary dust from his knees. He's perspiring, dis-
          hevelled, and still hasn°t said what he came to say.
          He waits there a moment more, Finally in a flat voice40without even looking at him:PETULIATell David, it's alright. He can
          come out of the cupboard.
          The old man almost sobs. Instead he exclaims in a
          jolly voice.MR. DANNERChin up'.81A ROLLER DERBYThis time we are with the T.V. CAMERAMAN, and we are
          looking through his scanner. We see all the excited
          people, but among them sit Archie and Polo, as cold as
          death. Suddenly, on the scanner, we see Polo rise and
          begin to leave tugging the two boys along with her,
          Archie makes no move to stop them.82 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR DAYArchie wearing his white doctor's smock enters
          Petulia's room.8383 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM0The'bed where the second patient lay is empty. In
          Petulia's bed is the withered old man who earlier had
          taken Petulia's place in the Intense Care Unit. He's
          quite chipper now but is in many splints and braces.OLD MANI'm not sick! Don't waste time on me!
          Archie turns to face the nun in attendance.ARCHIEWhere is she?NUNMrs. Danner? They picked her up.

          in tip-top shape!81E EXT. DANNER HOUSE DAYArchie hops off the lift as it reaches the bottom of the
          cliff. At the front of the house we see David and two
          colored men at work on the wharf. At the wharf is the
          yacht. Archie racies up to the nearest door and begins
          ringing the bell.85 INT. THE MASTER BEDROOMPetulia couldn't be lovelier, or happier. She's in aISspecial hospital bed. There are flowers everywhere. She
          has her own colour T.V. set which is silently showing
          scenes of violence. An efficient nurse is in attendance.8485 CONTINUED0 The nurse is sitting at the foot of the bed, and Petulia
          is brushing the nurse's hair.
          Archie stands in the doorway overwhelmed at the normality
          of it all. Obviously Petulia has fixed her hair too.PETULIAHi Archie.
          Dazedly Archie crosses to the night stand where there
          is a pitcher of tomato juice. Because he has nothing
          else to do he sniffs the tomato juice,PETULIA(to nurse)
          This is Dr. Bollen of the Hospital.
          He's a splendid doctor,
          (to Archie)
          This is Agnes Lillywhite.NURSEOur young lady is doing nicely. We
          have a few problems, but nothing
          serious.PETULIA• I get hiccups.` I go along merrily
          hiccupping for hours on end.ARCHIEWhy did you leave the hospital?PETULIAI was feeling ever so much better, Archie.
          Mrs. Danner looks in. She is wearing an apron and
          stirring a batch of something.MRS. DANNERWill you be staying for lunch, sir?
          Goodness knows there's plenty of meatloaf.
          She goes and David enters. He looks extremely handsome.
          He wears white duck pants and a slip-over sweater. And
          a happy-go-lucky grin.PETULIAYou two haven't met.
          (to David)
          This is Dr. Bollen.08585 CONTINUED0DAVID(CHEERFULLY)Yes, I thought so. Hello, there!
          David sees that Archie has no intention of shaking
          his hand, so he crosses to the bed and begins to
          playfully Drank Petulia up and down.ARCHIE(to Petulia)
          I want you to go back to the hospital.DAVIDDr. Worthington says she's doing fine.
          He's going to make daily house calls.PETULIAHe's very good about that.ARCHIEPetulia _m® !
          During this Mr. Danner has entered. He is really the
          only one not good at the charade.0PETULIA(CHEERFULLY)Well, you're finally meeting our
          whole family.MR. DANNERDr. Bollen, I wouldn't exactly call
          this good taste. Not to mention
          medical ethics.DAVIDDad, you old fuddy-duddy, things happen.
          Archie suspects he is having a nightmare. With the
          exception of Mr. Danner, he has never seen so many
          cheerful people in one place.ARCHIE(to Petulia)
          You told the policeman you had a
          dizzy spell.PETULIARight. I fell on my bottom.08685 CONTINUED0 ARCHIEYou were beaten up. You were somebody's
          punching bag.MR. DANNERwon't have you cross-examining this
          girl.ARCHIEYour son nearly killed this girl.DAVID(FRIENDLY)Hey now listen, doe, I'll stand still
          for only so much.MR. DANNER(to the nurse)
          I want you to remember what this man
          just said.
          (to Archie)
          Though it's none of your business, my
          boy was in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
          Looking at boats.PETULIAWe've decided we're quite happy with
          the one we have.DAVIDWhen Dad phoned me I was having dinner
          with a cousin of ours. Real mouth-
          watering Creole cooking.
          He and Petulia chuckle at each other as though this
          were some kind of private joke. Archie crosses to
          Petulia and just stands there looking at her. He
          doesn't know what to do.PETULIA(HAPPILY)I'm fine Archie. Except I burp a lot.
          Everybody gets dizzy spells.
          Archie looks incredulously from Petulia who has resumed
          brushing the nurse's hair; to David; to Mr. Danner who's
          obviously annoyed at Archie's bad taste; to Mrs. Danner
          who is in the dining room setting up an extra place
          for Archie. What can he do? Abruptly he rushes from
          the house.8786 EXT. HOUSEArchie runs toward the lift that will move him up the
          cliff. He can't get away fast enough. He climbs into
          the lift and pushes the button. The lift begins moving,
          but too slowly for him. He hops off the lift and begins
          scrambling up the side of the cliff.87 INT. PETULIA'S BEDROOMPetulia looks out the window and sees Archie scrambling
          up the cliff, She fits a curler into the nurse's hair.PETULIA'S VOICEGoing back to the house was the only
          thing I could do.
           scenes 87A B D .,and E occur only in Petulia's mind.87A EXT. ATOP CLIFF DAYPetulia is waiting for Archie at the top of the cliff
          as he staggers toward her. Since everything is taking
          place in her mind, this is how Petulia really is.PETULIA(CONTINUING)Where else could I go? A lonely hotel
          room? I don't have a penny of my own.
          Mr. Danner promised me I'd never be left
          alone. I thought I'd try it for a few
          days. Don't be-angry. It was nobody's
          fault. Actually, if anyone is to blame,
          it's you, Archie.ARCHIE(GASPING)Me?I.o87B INT. FAIRMONT HOTEL NIGHTPetulia now recreates the moment when she first met Archie.
          Archie is searching through his pockets for the ticket
          to reclaim his coat, Petulia rushes up to him, with
          none of the fake nonsense of the actual meeting, but
          with absolute desperation. Archie is dressed as he
           is on the hill (Scene 86).PETULIAI'm Petulia Danner . save me like

          majestically through towering trees, carrying Petulia
          to safety.PETULIA'S VOICE(CONTINUING)9 Why didn't you bring a proper ambulance?
          As though you really meant it.ARCHIE'S VOICEI didn't know what to do. I was going
          from one moment to the next.PETULIA'S VOICESpectacular entrance, lousy exit. Sounds
          familiar, Archie.
          Suddenly all the anger goes out of Petulia.PETULIA'S VOICE:No, it's not your fault.87E THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE DAYPetulia dismisses the ambulance from her mind because
          she has something very serious to say to Archie. She
          is with him on the rocks below the bridge.PETULIAI went back to the house because I owed it
          to David. I have a brown thumb when it
          comes to men. I put them on the Cross and
          call them Jesus. And there they hang. I
          don't know why I do it. Not because of any
          high opinion of myself... oh, Archie, if you
          only knew...8987E Continued
          She looks up at the bridge and instantly creates David
          standing there. An incredibly heroic figure in a white
          blazer and turtle neck sweater. Yet somehow we must
          sense that despite how grand David looks, at any moment
          in Petulia's mind he may leap to his death.PETULIALook at him. Isn't he super. A six foot
          three Coca Cola bottle. Empty. I did
          that. I'd ruin you, Archie.87F INT. BEDROOMWe are now back in visual reality with Petulia, and
          the playful David who is trying to make Petulia laugh,
          which she does.PETULIA'S VOICEDavid was the gentlest man I ever knew.88 EXT. CLIFFArchie has neared the top of the cliff. His pants are
           ripped, his hands are scraped, he is gasping in anguish.�PETULIA'S VOICEI'd ruin you. In five weeks, I'd be
          running around with a black eye.
          By now, Archie has reached the top of the cliff and is
          a complete mess. He turns for one last look at the
          Danner house and the yacht beyond. He shakes his fist
          maniacally.89 EXT0 MUIR WOODS DAYDuring the following SEQUENCE OF SCENES Archie is
          trying to get back to normality. He's having a nice
          sensible talk with Warren Smith, Polo's fiance. It
          is a pleasant sunny day and a group of Indian boys are
          being told about the forest by an Irish guide. In the
          background Archie's two children are playing with
          Warren's child.WARRENIt's never too soon to think of the
          boys' education.
          Warren winks at him knowingly.ARCHIEHave you thought of doing something
          about that?9089 CONTINUEDWARRENWhat ?ARCHIE; ; ^ ^ ���,, That twi Lch v v d.WARRENWhat twitch? I don't have a twitch.ARCHIEYou do. Come and see me. Don't touch

          it for free.WARRENThanks, I will. You know, I like you
          more t han I ever thought I would.ARCHIEWarren, you're a beautiful human being.
          They turn to watch the boys at play.
          Nearby, the guide is explaining something to the Indians.INDIAN CHILDWhat happens next?GUIDESpring.
          Archie smiles hoeefully.90 INTO A MARVELOUS RESTAURANT NIGHTBeyond is the entire shockingly beautiful panorama of
          San Francisco. Archie and May are having champagne
          cocktails. They clink glasses and look at each other
          through candlelight. Archie spills some of his cock-
          tail but May doesn't spill a drop. Archie smiles
          hopefully.91 INTO DISCOTHEQUE NIGHTArchie dances with many girls, some hippies, some chic,
          all terribly young and unsmiling. Archie smiles
          hopefully.92 EXT. A SA111'For the first EQ ENCE BEGAN Archie is
           not smiling. He _L z ri g at Petulia. Archie and his
           boys are riding on ou side of a cable car. The car
          has stopped at the t p of the hill as has the car going
          the other way. in the other car is Petulia by herself.
          Petulia waves f.rst. Archie waves back. Petulia has
          shopping parcels.AR C HIEYou look better.PETULIAFeel marvelous. Michael and Stevie?
          Archie nods,ARCHIEWe?-re going to see the penguins.
          Everything okay with yourPETULIAOh yes, fine.
          The cars start down their separate ways.93 INT. PENGUIN PLACE DAYThirty penguins march around the rim of their pool to the
          music of Pomp and Circumstance. Through the Public
          Address System, a voice explains that the penguins
          represent all nations and are gathered 'here for their
          own Olympics which they originated two million years ago,
          when penguins were nine feet tall and great athletes.
          Archie senses someone staring at him, turns and sees
          Petulia sitting in the grandstand with her parcels. He
          tries to ignore her by concentrating on his kids, but
          he cannot. Actually, he doesn't want to ignore Petulia.
          He looks back, she is still there, smiling happily.
          Archie gestures for the boys to stay where they are, then
          starts toward Petulia.
          The penguins are now going through various acrobatics
          while the narrator is telling more about their exotic
          origins. Archie stumbles through laughing children,
          ruins a tourist's snapshot, etc., until he finally reaches
          Petulia.
          Now one penguin is pushing another penguin in a baby
          carriage. Everyone thinks it's adorable.
          Archie sits beside Petulia not really knowing what to say.
          He hasn't decided whether to be angry that she has followed
          him,- or amused, or delighted -- or all three.920 93 CONTINUEDNow the taped music is blaring a Loud marching song as
          the penguins lumberingly form into a Roman legion, The
          laughter,, music and applause ?make any intimate conversa-
          tion almost impossible. But Petulia is waiting for
          Archie to say something.
          Archie sees that Mike has turned from the penguins to
          stare at his father accusingly. Mike won't stop staring.
          Mike now tries to make Stevie turn and look accusingly
          with him, Archie doesn't know what to do0
          Finally, Petulia rises and gathers her parcels,, still
          quite pleasant. She drops a parcel and Archie retrieves
          it for hero Its from a sportswear shop,, colorful and
          gay. As Archie gives Petulia the parcel, she touches
          his hand, running her fingers lightly over his skin,
          thoughtful, as though wanting to remember something.
          Petulia moves quickly through people toward the exit.
          Archie almost calls her back, but there is too much noise.9. INT. CORRIDOR ARCHIE'S APARTMENT DAYArchie is returning from work, weighted down with
          books for his research, plus miscroscope.
          He sees his apartment door ajar. His heart stops.
          He kicks his door open with his foot, not daring to
          think who will be inside.95 INT. ARCHIE'S APARTMENTNo, you're wrong. Its not Petulia. Two elderly
          gentlemen in spotless dungarees are just finishing
          installing a portable greenhouse in Arc hie's living
          room. The Mexican paper flowers have been carefully
          moved.FIRST GENTLEMANOh, oho We were supposed to be out of
          here before you came home, Dr. Bollen.
          So you'd think it came from Santa Claus,
          The two elderly gentlemen chuckle at Archie's puzzled
          look.9395 CONTINUEDFIRST GENTLEMANWonderful. i.sn g t - t ? They sell like
          hot cakes. Gives you something alive
          in all this stone.ARCHIEThere must be some mistake.
          He sags down on a chair, draped in his research books.
          The two old gentlemen couldn't be more pleased.FIRST GENTLEMANMac and I get a, big kick out of people's
          first reaction. Its not a toy. It's
          a working greenhouse. You control heat
          and humidity with these.
          (he indicates dials)
          You've got a little bit of everything.
          Ornamental plants,, Zinnias, Asters.
          Even a little vegetable garden. The
          most important thing to remember is
          to keep the sun out. These new kind
          of lights work so much better, there's
          no comparison.�ARCHIEYou've got the wrong apartment lFIRST GENTLEMAN(CHEERFULLY)No we have not s Dr. Bollen3ARCHIEWhat screwball ...?I
          Then he stops, He knows what screwball.ARCHIENo gift card?FIRST GENTLEMANIt might come by mail.
          Archie starts chuckling. He crosses to the green-
          house, still chuckling.9L.95 CONTINUED�ARCHIEThis one heat, and this one humidity,
          right?FIRST GENTLEMANExactly. We've left a manual of
          operations, and wetll check everything
          out in a month. Okay, Dr. Bollen?ARCHIE(still chuckling)
          Okay, okay! Goodbye,'
          He enters the greenhouse, having to stoop almost double, as
          the two old gentlemen exit from the apartment.96 INT. GREENHOUSEThough extremely uncomfortable, Archie is entirely happy.
          Suddenly he is ripping up flowers and vegetables to make a
          kooky bouquet. He is positively exultant. He adds radishes
          and turnips to the bouquet. This is the happiest we have
          ever seen Archie.�97. EXT. DANNER HOUSE DAYArchiets car is parked on the cliff.
          The Danner house is dark, deserted, abandoned.
          Archie is standing by himself on the wharf bouquet in hand.
          The yacht has gone. And so has Petulia.
          Archie feels utterly alone, and as a matter of fact, he is.
          He tosses the bouquet into the water. The lettuce floats.97A EXT. THE YACHT DAYTheoretically, we should be at some flea bag port in South
          America. Mostly, we SEE the yacht.4095097A Continued
          Petulia is sunbathing on the yacht. She looks much better
          now. Weeks have passed, she has a golden tan. Beside her,
          a transistor radio has picked up a local broadcast which
          would be in either Spanish or Portuguese and which consists
          mostly of music.
          David hops onto the yacht carrying a bag of groceries.
          He, too, is deeply tanned, marvelously healthy, but somehow
          uneasy.DAVIDHi.PETULIADid you get mama on the plane all right?DAVIDSure. But what a dinky plane. Poor
          mamats stomach problems are far from over.
          He enters the cabin. Petulia sits up after a moment, looks
          about, sees no one else, then then in alarm peers into one
           of the windows that looks down into the cabin.�97B INT. CABINDavid is stowing food into the refrigerator.PETULIAYou didn't leave papa alone in that

          He uses the English way of saying "vitamin," and then a bit
          too rakishly he tosses an orange up through the window.
          Instinctively, Petulia makes an effort to catch, misses,
          and it hits her lightly on the shoulder. Though it causes
          no damage,'David is suddenly in terror. He races up out
          of the cabin to Petulia.97C EXT. YACHT DAYDavid rushes to Petulia. Of course the orange did no damage
          whatever, but there is an abrupt tension between them. He
          flops down beside her and begins peeling the orange,DAVIDPapa went with her at the last minute.
          Petulia REACTS, shocked.DAVID(CONTINUING)She was so pale and seared. They aren't
          even pressurized. The plane. You suck
          on a tube and hope it's oxygen.SDuring this he has peeled the orange and torn it into
          segments, which he now tries to feed her.DAVIDOpen.PETULIAHow could he have gone? Just like that?DAVIDWhere mama is concerned, papa is a very
          loving man. Open.
          Instead, Petulia jumps frightened to her feet, She seems
          about to leave the yacht.DAVIDPlease don't.PETULIAHe Dromised;DAVIDHoney. It'll be okay, Cross my heart.0 PETULTAHe promised.970 97C Continued
          A middle-aged couple are passing by on their way to their
          luxurious yacht which is anchored close by. They are
          trailed by a rather tacky Mari-ache trio,W OMANHello there you gorgeous people.
          Everyone's invited for Margueritas
          and cha-cha-cha.PETULIA(DAZEDLY)Mr. and Mrs. Danner are gone,WOMAN(a`s corny as this)
          Oooh la la; Lucky you;
          The group goes off, toward their yacht. Petulia doesn't know
          what to do. David skims off his jeans and jackknifes into
          the water. The sun glints on his exquisite body. Confusedly,
          Petulia pops a segment of an orange into her mouth. David
          surfaces from the water laughing up at her. He looks great.97D EXT. YACHT NIGHTPetulia and David are returning from the other yacht. They
          are dressed casually, but very well. David is completely
          happy. Petulia is uneasy -- uneasy hell, she's frightened
          out of her wits. From the other yacht we still hear the
          SOUNDS of the Mariache trio and people squealing with delight
          David is humming along with the music.PETULIAWe didn't have to come back this early..DAVIDYou're still not one hundred per cent
          well.
          They've reached the cabin. He enters. She waits outside.
          Suddenly his hand is around her wrist, somewhat too hard, and
          in a gesture he hopes is playful, he pulls her down the steps
          into the cabin.97E INTO CABINDAVIDIcy hands.0PETULIAWarm heart.9897E Continued10DAVIDSo they say,
          Petulia says nothing. She begins undressing,DAVID(CONTINUING)I didn't tell papa to leave.

          She doesn't answer.DAVID(CONTINUING)I didn't.want him to leave.PETULIAAll right, David.• DAVID"All right, David," through chattering
          teeth.
          Petulia crawls under the sheet of a bunk.DAVIDOnly a crazy man hits a woman. Or a
          coward. T won't ever again. I'd
          stick my hand into a garbage disposal.
          I would, Petulia. I'd grind it up,
          Petulia lies under the sheet, silent, rigid, David
          abruptly crosses to a cabinet and takes out a signal flare
          pistol. He snaps in a flare and tosses it at Petulia.
          She sits up in panic.DAVIDHang on to it. If I come for you let
          me have a flare. Between the eyes.
          I'll melt in ten seconds.
          Petulia is touched.09997E Continued

          the nameplate "DR, A. BOLEN." The door finally opens and
          Petulia is standing there in Archie's hooded sweatshirt.
          Her eyes widen in terror as David enters Archie's apartment.
          She knows he has come here to kill her,
          97G The image ends. David is abruptly withdrawn, but Petulia
          is carried away by memory.PETULIAThe first time I saw you, you were being
          charming to- somebody who didn't buy a

          meets David carrying a silly, sweet gift. David
          tenses for a show-down, Archie impulsively flips out
          David's tie and continues on his way,100 EXT0 HOSPITAL DAYAs Archie exits from the hospital a kid on a roller
          board almost kills him.
          He has an ice cream bar. He sees three pretty girls,
          one with blonde hair like Petulia's. But it's the
          dark-haired girl who feels his gaze and looks back.
          Archie, watching the girl, and eating his ice cream,
          leans against an electrical appliance shop window.
          Inside, among endless other items is a single T.V.
          tube, on which the world's violence flickers silently
          and unnoticed as before.
          As we leave Archie, we feel a sense of euphoria -- well,

          ceiling. Two hands move toward her face holding an
