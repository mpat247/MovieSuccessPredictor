P R E T T Y   W O M A Nby Jonathan Lawton &  Stephen Metcalfe--------------------------------------------------------------EXT. A HOUSE IN THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHTThe view of downtown Los Angeles from the enormous, ornate house
  is extraordinary.  A small outdoor dinner party is in progress.

  A MAGICIAN is entertaining guests.  Playing cards and coins
  appear and disappear in his nimble hands.INT. HOUSE STUDY - NIGHTEDWARD HARRIS stands at the window, impassively looking down
  at the party.  Edward is a handsome, well groomed man of around
  forty.  He looks tired; the kind of fatigue that can't be cured
  by a night's sleep.EDWARD(a murmur)
    Left pocket.

  And indeed, down below, the magician pulls the coin from the
  left pocket of the incredulous WOMAN's silk blazer.  More
  laughter and applause.

  The study is in keeping with the rest of the house.  Luxurious.
  Everything the best.  WILLIAM STUCKEY, Edward's contemporary,
  is a crafty looking lawyer who is the party host.  VANCE is an
  investment banker.  His assistant JAKE, is a financial
  researcher.  The other men are INVESTMENT BANKERS.  They are
  in dark suits and power ties.  On the table are stacks of
  documents and folders, the name "KROSS INDUSTRIES" is prominent
  on many of the folders.INVESTMENT BANKER 1Our banks certainly doesn't want
    to discourage Harris Enterprises
    from investing in California.
    We think this is a great new venue
    for you but you've got to
    understand the mergers and
    acquisitions market is changing.
    With the upswing in inflation we
    have to make these offerings
    tempting to offset the risk.VANCELook, we're talking about hard
    assets and a straight liquidation.
    We have over a thousand man hours
    in this deal.STUCKEY(losing patience)
    This is a "no brainer".  There's
    no risk for you.  No one has ever
    lost money backing Mr. Harris.INVESTMENT BANKER 2Not yet.  But ship building is
    a new endeavor for you...STUCKEY(cuts him off)
    Come on.  You know we're not
    going to go into ship building.
    Besides, you're the ones with the
    troubled track record, not us!INVESTMENT BANKER 3Bill, be reasonable.  If you're
    really going to digest Kross
    Industries that quickly eighteen
    should not be such a problem.
    Besides, I don't think there's
    anywhere else you can go for the
    money in the time you have.EDWARDIt's unacceptable.

  Edward turns from the window.  He hasn't miss a thing.  All
  eyes are on him.EDWARDDraymen Heux has offered me
    seventy-five in the pool at
    sixteen and a half.  I can secure
    the other half personally.  You
    have until tomorrow morning to
    make me a better offer.

  The bankers speechlessly stare at him.EDWARDThe meeting is over, gentlemen.

  He turns away.  The bankers look at one another.  They rise.
  Silence as they exit.  When the door closes.  Stuckey explodes
  with laughter.STUCKEYHah!  Did you see the look on
    their faces?VANCEYou don't think we pushed too
    hard?STUCKEYNO way!  They'll come back.  They
    can't afford not to.  Edward,
    that bluff was beautiful.EDWARDMaybe I should have made it
    rhyme.

  The others stare at him, uncertain.  Stuckey laughs.  The
  others follow suit.EDWARD(looking at his watch)
    Well!  It's late.  We've been
    at this long enough.

  Stuckey rises.  Edward ushers Vance and Jake toward the door.EDWARDGentlemen, enjoy the party.  The
    magician's wonderful.

  Vance and Jake exit.EDWARD(calling after them)
    Watch your left pocket.

  A BUTLER has entered the room.BUTLERPhone call, Mr. Harris.  It's Miss
    Charles.STUCKEYCynthia?  Is she coming out?EDWARDWe're about to find out.  Go on.
    Take care of your guests.

  Stuckey exits the room as Edward crosses to the telephone.EDWARD(into phone)
    Where are you, Cynthia?
      (beat)
    I see.
      (pausing, getting angry)
    No, I don't expect you to be at
    my beck-and-call.  Are you coming
    or not?INT. HOUSE - STAIRWAY - NIGHTEdward descends the long, curved stairway.  He has Vance in
  tow.EDWARD(all business)
    Prepare the filing papers.  Have
    them ready by the middle of the
    week.  I'll tell you when to
    submit them.

  The PEOPLE talking and drinking on the stairway gravitate
  toward Edward.A MANEdward!EDWARD(turning on the charm)
    Yes!THE MANWill we see you at the polo
    matches Wednesday?EDWARDWouldn't miss it.
      (abruptly; to Vance)
    I want this done fast and easy.
    No slip-ups.  I want to be back
    in New York by Saturday.  Got it?

  He deftly keeps making his way through the crowd.INT. HOUSE - THE DOWNSTAIRS HALL - NIGHTStuckey is sipping champagne and talking to a beautiful
  WOMAN in a tight sheath of an evening dress.  An elegant woman
      ELIZABETH STUCKEY approaches from behind him.  She taps him on
  the shoulder and he turns, startled.ELIZABETHBill?STUCKEY(flustered)
    Oh... Hi, honey... Millicent,
    uh, uh, Millicent.MILLICENTLowell.STUCKEYLowell, right.  My wife,
    Elizabeth.ELIZABETH(ignoring her)
    Is Edward leaving?

  Stuckey looks up to see Edward moving quickly toward the door.
  Stuckey abruptly leaves the two woman together to follow Edward.EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHTEdward comes out of the house.  Jags, a limo with waiting
  DRIVER and two BMW's pack the circular driveway behind a black
  Ferrari.  The limo driver leaps to attention at the sight of
  Edward.  Edward stands, making an obvious effort to keep his
  impatience under control.  Stuckey comes out of the house and
  down the walk.STUCKEYWhat's up, where you going?EDWARDGive me your car keys, will you,
    I'm going back to my hotel.STUCKEYAt least stay for a drink.  This
    party's for you.EDWARDApologize to Elizabeth for me.

  Stuckey gropes uncertainly in his pocket for keys.STUCKEYListen, there're some major local
    talent inside just dying to meet
    you...EDWARD(as if delighted)
    Really?  Some high class gold
    digger who speaks French better
    than I do?
      (turning away)
    No, thank you.  I just got off
    the phone with one.STUCKEYCynthia's not coming?EDWARDNo.

  Edward grabs the keys out of Stuckey's hand.  He crosses to a
  black Ferrari and gets in.STUCKEYLet your driver take you.  We'll
    move the cars...

  Edward starts the car.STUCKEYCan you drive a stick?

  The car lurches forward with a squeal of wheels and promptly
  stalls.STUCKEYEdward, give me a break!

  With a squeal of tires, the Ferrari bucks out of the driveway
  and... stalls again.EDWARDLove this car!  Is it new?STUCKEYYes!  And you don't even know
    where you're going!

  Edward starts it again and heads uncertainly uphill.  Stuckey
  watching, throws up his hands.STUCKEYThat's the wrong way!CREDITS BEGIN AS IN A SERIES OF CROSSCUTS:EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHTThe Ferrari, moving fast through the Hollywood Hills, passes
  large, beautiful homes... Edward shifts, grinding gears...EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHTThe Ferrari comes to a red light and pulls up next to a Dodge Colt.
  The GIRL in the Colt looks at Edward and his car admiringly.
  Edward feeling confident now, revs the engine.  The light turns
  green.  Edward immediately stalls the Ferrari.  The Colt leaves
  him in the dust.INT. FERRARI - NIGHTEdward drives.  He blinks, shakes his head as if trying to rid
  himself of his own tired thoughts.EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHTThe Ferrari comes to the intersection of OUTPOST and FRANKLIN,
  stops.  Edward gets out of the car.  He looks at the street
  signs.  He has no idea where he is.  He signs.  He gets back
  in the car and takes off on Franklin heading East.EXT. A SIDE STREET IN HOLLYWOOD - NIGHTA crumbling old apartment building.  Dark alley ways, deserted
  parking lot.

  The Ferrari -- blink and you miss it -- motors past the building,
  looking very out of place on the street.

  PANNING UP  A building facade of lit windows and metal fire
  escape.  One window in particular.  A GIRL stands there in a
  short kimono, looking down.  And then she turns away.INT.  VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHTA SERIES OF SHOTS to see her dressing.INT.  VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHTVIVIAN turns and stares at herself in a grainy, cracked bedroom
  mirror.  She is twenty years old and a prostitute.  Make-up
  applied to give her a hard, older look doesn't quite succeed.
  She'd be innocently beautiful without it.  She is wearing tiny
  shorts, a tight tube top, thigh high boots.  She stares at
  herself, not really liking what she sees.  A moment.  She signs,
  turns off the light and walks out of the bedroom.INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - NIGHTFaded, peeling walls.  Thread bare, dirty carpet.  Vivian locks
  the apartment door behind her and starts down the dim hallway.
  A door suddenly opens, startling her.  An unshaved, enormously
  pot bellied MAN in a stained t-shirt stares at Vivian with pig
  eyes.LANDLORDVivian.

  Vivian turns some "tough" on him.VIVIANYeah, what?LANDLORDRent.  You're late.VIVIANDon't give me that.  Kit gave it
    to you yesterday, cash.LANDLORDKit give me nothin'.VIVIAN(suddenly uncertain)

  Vivian hurries at a run back down the hallway.LANDLORDBy the end of the week or you're
    otta here.
      (a beat)
    By the way, you look very nice
    tonight!INT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - KITCHENVivian pulls a coffee can off a shelf.  She pulls off the top.
  It's empty.  She tosses the can away, starts for the door.  She
  opens it.INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHTDown the hallway, the landlord is standing in front of his open
  doorway, talking to a FAT WOMAN.  They both glance up.

  Vivian quickly closes the door.  She doesn't want to deal with
  them.EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHTVivian comes off the fire escape onto the sidewalk.  She hurried
  away.EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHTVivian walks along, urgently looking for something... someone.

  A BABBLING STREET-TYPE goes by happily talking to himself.
  He wears an "I Love Hollywood" t-shirt.

  Vivian passes TOURISTS but doesn't notice them any more than
  she pays attention to the VAGRANT she passes further on, huddle
  in a doorway.

  A LONG-HAIRED KID on a SKATEBOARD goes by dropping off little
  bags to various STREET-TYPES.

  A BARKER-TYPE stands in front of a photo store urging tourists
  to come in and take a photo with a cardboard cut-out of a movie
  star.  Some go in.

  Vivian hurries past a group of rubbernecking JAPANESE TOURISTS.
  A BLACK PROSTITUTE in a mini skirt strolls toward her.  A car
  passes.  The DRIVER stares at Vivian with interest.  She ignores
  him.  The black prostitute approaches the car.PROSTITUTEHey, baby, you lookin' for a date?

  The Driver looks her over.  The Black Prostitute gets in the
  car and it drives away.

  A GROUP OF MEN, mostly drug dealers, hang out at an all night
  coffee shop.  They WHISTLE and make obscene gestures and SOUNDS
  as Vivian hurries by.  She ignores them and goes next door into
  a falafel stand.  Half a dozen PEOPLE sit at dirty tables inside.INT. FALAFEL STAND - NIGHTBehind the counter are a MAN and a WOMAN, Vietnamese cooks
  frying food, trying to ignore the unsavory crowd camped in the
  shop.VIVIANChan, you seen Kit tonight?COOK 1Hi, hi!  No see nothing.VIVIANYou do, tell her I'm looking for
    her.COOK 2Looking good, bay-bee.VIVIANYeah, you too, D'Nai.  If Kit
    comes in here, tell her stay.

  Both of them nod and smile at Vivian.  Vivian exits.EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHTSkateboard zips by a GROUP.  We SEE a police car parked at the
  entrance to an alcove.  Also, an ambulance.  The bubblegum
  lights are going.  A CROWD has gathered.  The happy man with
  the "I Love Hollywood" t-shirt and a POLICE OFFICER are engaged
  in tense conversation.COPThey just pulled her out of a
    dumpster in the back.  Now talk
    to me.MANI tell you, man, I don't know who
    she hang with.COPShe have a pimp?MANCocaine her pimp, man.  She a
    strawberry.  She be out on these
    streets, day in, day out, tradin'
    her sorry ass for crack.  And
    now she dead from it.

  Vivian rushes up to join the outskirts of the crowd as the body
  of a YOUNG GIRL is pulled out of an open dumpster and carried
  towards the waiting ambulance.  For a moment Vivian thinks
  it's... no, Vivian turns grimly away.

  Vivian surveys the dark street.  And suddenly sees who's she's
  looking for.  Walks.EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - WIG SHOP - NIGHTWe SEE a young, tough-looking MAN and WOMAN trying on wigs.
  The STOREKEEPER is a man wearing a dress and wild wig.  The
  girl, KIT, is around 18, is dark haired and thin.  The young
  man, CARLOS, has his arm sloppily draped across Kit's shoulder.
  They giggle about something, both obviously high.  Kit looks
  up, bleary-eyed.  She stops.  Vivian is standing in front of
  her.VIVIANYou spent it on drugs, didn't you?KITHi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my
    roommate, Viv.CARLOSLookin' good, baby.VIVIAN(ignoring him)
    Did you blow it all, Kit?  Is it
    all gone?KITCarlos had some great rock.VIVIANI bet.

    mouth?  Your frien' still owes

    Let's go.

  Skateboard appears suddenly, blocking Vivian and Kit's path.VIVIANGet out of my face or I'll have
    those cops on your ass in two
    seconds.

  Carlos glares at her.  He looks down toward the lights of the
  cop cars.  One of the POLICEMEN looks towards them, curiously.
  Vivian waves at the cop.CARLOS(threatening to Vivian)
    Don't take no dates tonight,
    chica, you got one with me.

  Vivian grabs Kit by the arm and pulls her across the Boulevard.INT. FALAFEL STAND - NIGHTVivian and Kit sit at a table sipping tea.  Vivian is still
  mad at her.VIVIANWe worked for that money.  We
    were gonna put together enough
    to get out of that dump we live
    in, get off this street.KITViv... don't be stupid.  We're
    whores.

  Vivian looks like she wants to weep.  Or scream.  She does
  neither.  She slowly nods.  Kit's sorry she said that.

          KIT (cont'd)
    So I blew our stash.  We could
    make it all back with one good
    night on the streets.VIVIANI just saw somebody pulled out
    of a dumpster.  I wonder how much

    you back.  I promise.VIVIANI thought you were giving up that
    drug shit.KITI will.  I'm trying.

  another prostitute, RACHEL.KITNo no, honey.  You see these
    stars on the sidewalk.  Me and
    Vivian work from Don Ameche all
    the way up to Roy Rogers.

    You look hot tonight.  And
    remember, don't mouth off.  They
    don't like that.VIVIANOkay.  Go home.  But take it easy
    on that shit.

  Kit gives Vivian a quick hug.KITYou're the greatest.  I'll wait
    up for you.

  And then Kit is off, moving quickly away.  Vivian turns.  She
  stares at the Ferrari, loathing it and all it represents.  And
  then it's as if Vivian turns a switch.  She fluffs her mane of
  hair, throws her shoulders back, thrusting her breasts out and
  sashays towards the car, a sexy, friendly smile on her face.

  In the driver's seat of the Ferrari, Edward is looking furious
  and distracted.  Vivian leans over the passenger window.VIVIANHey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?EDWARDWhat's that?VIVIANYou looking' for some company?EDWARDUh, no.  How do I get to Beverly
    Hills?VIVIANWhat?

  He pulls out his money clip.

  Vivian suddenly freezes.  On the sidewalk up ahead, Carlos and
  Skateboard.  Carlos flashes an evil, menacing grin.  He motions
  to Skateboard, they start forward.EDWARD(holding up a bill)
    You have change for a twenty.

  Vivian pulls open the door of the car and jumps in.VIVIANFor twenty, Ill show you

  She looks up.  She stops in her tracks.  The lobby is bright
  and spacious, filled with thick carved wood paneling.  Even at
  this hour there is a great deal of activity.  MEN in business
  suits and WOMEN in furs and jewels are passing by.  Vivian's
  face quickly conceals the sudden awe she feels at the sight of
  all this luxury.  Vivian matter of factly reaches out and takes
  Edward's arm.VIVIANSo let's go.

  closes the door and walks past her down the steps to the living
  room.  Edward picks up a phone.  Vivian checks out the room.EDWARD(into the phone)

  Vivian is impressed but she's not going to admit it.VIVIANYou kidding?  I come here all the
    time.  As a matter of fact they
    do rent this room by the hour.

  Edward smiles.  He sits down in a comfortable chair and leans
  back.  Vivian looks at him.

          VIVIAN (cont'd)
    Well, now that you have me for
    the night, what are you going to
    do with me?EDWARDWant to know something?  I don't
    quite know.  I hadn't planned
    this.VIVIANDo you plan everything?EDWARD(a small smile)
    Always.VIVIANWell, the meter's running, it's
    your money.  Speaking of which,
    cash'll do.  In advance.EDWARDFair enough.

  He rises.  Takes out his wallet.  Standing over her, he drops
  THREE crisp, new hundred dollar bills in Vivian's lap.  She
  picks up the bills, stares at them, trying not to be impressed.
  She puts the money in her jacket.  She realizes Edward is
  standing over her as if waiting.

  She leans forward, reaches out to unzip his pants.  He abruptly
  turns away.EDWARDLet's talk some more first.VIVIANRight.
      (brightly)
    So!  In town on business?EDWARD(taking off his jacket)
    Uh-huh.VIVIANLet me guess, you're a... lawyer.EDWARD(loosening his tie)
    And why do you say that?VIVIAN(a small smile)
    I dunno... you have that sharp,
    useless look.

  Edward almost smiles.  He sits across from her again.EDWARDSounds like you've known a lot
    of lawyers.VIVIANI've known a lot of everybody.

  A chime goes off to indicate there's someone at the door.EDWARDChampagne.

  He starts to sit up.  Vivian motions for him to stay put.VIVIANHey.  I might as well make myself
    useful.

  Edward sits back down.  Vivian waltzes up the steps and opens
  the front door.  A WAITER comes into the room with a silver
  cart; on it is a bucket of champagne and a covered bowl.WAITERWhere would you like it?VIVIANWhere would we like it?EDWARDWhere would we like it?  Here'll
    be fine.

  The Waiter carries it down the steps and sets it in the middle
  of the living room.  He turns and heads back up the stairs and
  pauses near Vivian, staring.  Vivian stares back at him.VIVIANWhat are you looking at?

  The Waiter glances away uncomfortably and exits.  Vivian closes
  the door behind him.  Vivian marches back down the stairs.EDWARDI think he wanted you to tip him.VIVIANTsk.  Excuse me, I didn't think
    he had change for a hundred.

  Edward crosses to the silver stand.  Vivian watches with
  interest as he twirls the champagne bottle in the ice bucket.

          VIVIAN (cont'd)
    You have a wife?  Girlfriend?EDWARDI have both.

  Edward lifts the bottle out.  He deftly pops the cork on the
  bottle without losing a drop of champagne.VIVIANWhere are they?  Shopping
    together?EDWARDThey should be.  They're both good
    at it.

  Edward pours the champagne into a single long stemmed glass and
  hands one to Vivian.

          EDWARD (cont'd)
    My ex-wife lives in London in what
    used to be my home.
    My girlfriend is in New York
    moving out of my apartment even
    as we speak.  Cheers.

  He drinks, nods approvingly.EDWARDIt's a very good year.VIVIANOooh, thank god.

  Edward laughs softly.  She sips it.  To her surprise, really
  likes it.  Edward lifts a lid on a silver bowl to reveal a dozen
  enormous strawberries.EDWARDTry a strawberry.VIVIANWhy?EDWARDBecause they bring out the flavor
    of the champagne.VIVIANJesus, you act like you're
    seducing some Valley girl you
    picked up in a dance club.EDWARDVivian... the meter's running...
    cooperate.

  A moment.  She slowly eats a strawberry.  The juice of it stains
  her lips.  Her eyes are like smoke as she takes a sensuous sip
  of champagne, licks away the stain of the strawberry.  His eyes
  haven't left her.EDWARD(softly)
    You really are a very beautiful
    girl.VIVIAN(husky-voiced)
    Just a romantic, that's you.EDWARDYes...

  Her mouth is so wet and inviting... he leans closer...VIVIANMe too.

  He's about to kiss her...

  Smiling, Vivian reaches behind her, touching him.  He tries not
  to groan.  She's moving faster now.  Edward suddenly pulls her
  violently to him, he rolls her over...INT. PENTHOUSE BATHROOM - SHOWER - NIGHTA heavy spray of water comes down upon Edward.  He stands there
  quietly letting it wash over him.  He turns off the shower,
  steps out of the stall, picks up a towel and dries himself.INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHTEdward stares.  His expensive clothes are on the floor,
  haphazardly dropped everywhere.  Vivian's clothes, as tattered
  as they are, are neatly folded and piled on a chair.  The
  incongruity of it touches Edward in a sad way.  He looks toward
  the bed.  Vivian is fast asleep.  Her heavy makeup has long since
  been rubbed off.  Asleep, her wary, smart-ass attitude is gone.

  She looks like a sweet, gentle girl.  He stares at her a moment
  longer.  He turns, goes into the living room.  Vivian opens her
  eyes.  Through the open door she sees Edward sitting in a living
  room chair.  He is reading contracts.EXT. REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - MORNINGThe sun is coming up as HOTEL EMPLOYEE hoses down the sidewalk

    make it social.  Tell Kross I'll

    office.  By the way, about your
    car...STUCKEYOh, god, what?EDWARD(smiling)
    I'll bring it back.

  Edward hangs up.  He pours a glass of orange juice and takes
  a sip, thinking.  Something makes him turn.  Vivian, wearing
  a monogrammed hotel terry robe, is standing uncertainly in the
  bedroom doorway.EDWARDGood morning.VIVIANYou didn't wake me.  I'll be out
    of here in a minute.EDWARDNo hurry.  Would you like some
    breakfast?

  She's hungry and the breakfast looks great.VIVIANOnly if you do.

  serves them breakfast.EDWARDDid you sleep well?VIVIANYeah.  Too good.  I forgot where
    I was.EDWARDOccupational hazard?

  She looks at him sharply, sees that he means no offense,
  relaxes.VIVIANWhere'd you go?EDWARDI took the couch.  I had some work
    to do.

    About last night...VIVIANOooh, Baby, you were the best.
    I was beside myself.EDWARDMmm, I could tell.VIVIANI just hope it was worth three
    hundred bucks.EDWARDI'd say you give a good dollar

    what do you do anyway?EDWARDI buy companies.VIVIANNo shit.  They expensive?

  He almost smiles.  She almost smiles back.EDWARDThe one I'm buying this week will
    cost around 150 million.VIVIAN... dollars?

  He nods.  This time Vivian is impressed.

          VIVIAN (cont'd)
    You are major league, baby.  Your
    mother must be very proud.

  Edward is oddly pleased at her reaction.INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - DAYThe closet door is open.  Edward reaches for a tie.  In the
  closet are about a dozen expensive looking suits, shirts, shoes,
  etc.  She follows him in.VIVIANSo what a ya do with the companies
    once you buy'm?EDWARD(fumbling with the tie)
    I sell them.VIVIANWhat?  Why?

  She undoes his knot and starts over.

    At ease, let me do that.  Part
    of the all night services.EDWARDBy breaking up a company's assets--VIVIANWhat are assets?EDWARDVivian --VIVIANC'mon, I might buy a company some
    day.EDWARDAssets are anything of value a
    company owns.  Sometimes the

    whole.  By selling them off, I
    make a profit.VIVIANSorta like stealing cars and
    selling'm for parts, huh?EDWARDNot... quite.VIVIANThere, see?  Now the emblem is
    right in the middle of the knot.EDWARDWhere'd you learn to do this?VIVIAN(sarcastic)

    school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa.
    He liked ties on Sundays.  You
    mind if I take a swim in your
    bathtub before I hit it?EDWARDDon't drown.

  Vivian turns and heads toward the bathroom.  He follows her
  into the bathroom.INT. PENTHOUSE BATHROOM - DAYVivian turns on the water in the tub.  It fills the tub in a
  torrential rush.VIVIANYou could hold a pep rally in

  She turns it on.  The water hits her in the face.EDWARD(stifling a chuckle)
    I'm a big boy.

  There are lotions and shampoos and bubblebaths on the edge of
  the tub.  Vivian regards them like a kid in a candy shop.STUCKEYLet me at least get you a date.
    Keep it social.

  Edward watches as Vivian smells some bubble bath.  She smiles.
  Her eyes ask Edward if it's okay to...?  He nods.STUCKEYEdward, did you hear me?EDWARDI'm here.STUCKEYI know a lot of nice girls.

  Vivian pours the bubblebath into the swirling water.  There's
  something about the look on her face... the way she bites her
  lower lip... curious, sensual...EDWARDI have one.

  Edward hangs up the phone as Vivian curiously turns on the
  television.  The sound blares.  She fumbles to turn it down.
  Edward reaches over and turns it off.EDWARDAll right.  How much for the week?VIVIANWhat?EDWARDI'm in town until Saturday.

  She look at him like he isn't speaking English.EDWARDDo-you-want-to-stay-here-

  It takes Vivian a moment to respond.VIVIANIt'd cost you.EDWARDOf course.  How much?VIVIANFive full nights... days too?

  They move through the bedroom into the living room.EDWARDI'll be out most of the day.

  He reaches into his pocket for a money clip.  He peels off
  bills.  He hands the cash to Vivian.EDWARDI want you to go out and buy some
    decent clothes.

  Vivian's eyes go wide at the amount of money.EDWARDNothing too flashy, not too sexy.
    Conservative.  Understand?INT. PENTHOUSE ENTRANCE WAY - DAYThey're at the front door.VIVIANYeah, you want me to dress like

  She lies back into the soapy water and disappears.  She suddenly
  pops back up, laughing.VIVIANThree thousand!

  A thought occurs to her.  She reaches for the cordless phone.
  She dials.  She waits.  She is about to disconnect when the
  phone is answered.KIT (O.S.)'Lo.VIVIANKit!  Where've you been?KIT (O.S.)I was asleep.  You woke me.  You

  is back in her hooker clothes.  She leaves an envelope at the
  front desk.

  MR. THOMAS, the prim, middle-aged hotel manager, steps out from
  his office.  He stares in surprise and displeasure as he sees
  Vivian exit out the front door.  Vivian doesn't notice the odd
  stares she gets from two well-dressed MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN who are
  just entering.EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAYVivian is looking wide-eyed and delighted and yes, more than
  a bit overwhelmed.  She passes store windows... and MORE STORE
  WINDOWS... and still MORE STORE WINDOWS.  Each display is more
  beautiful and expensive than the one before.

  Vivian is also aware that she is getting odd looks.  From
  PASSERBY'S.  Two beautiful dressed GIRLS her own age look at
  her, turn away and giggle.  The uniformed GUARDS that stand at
  attention in front of many of the stores, stare at her
  suspiciously.

  Feeling more and more uncomfortable, Vivian comes to a posh
  woman's boutique.  She hesitates for a moment.  She enters.INT. BOUTIQUE - DAYVivian is no sooner in the door than she is subject to the
  disapproving stare of a SALESWOMAN standing behind the counter.SALESWOMAN(cooly)
    May I help you?VIVIANI'm just looking, thanks.

  Vivian tiptoes through the shop as if it was filled with
  delicate glass objects.  She cautiously examines a dress.  The
  Saleswoman quickly comes around the counter and approaches her.SALESWOMANAre you looking for something in
    particular?VIVIANYes.  Something... conservative.SALESWOMANYes...

  Vivian eyes the Saleswoman, puzzled at her tone.  She examines
  a dress.VIVIANYou have beautiful things.
      (no reply)
    How much is this?SALESWOMANI don't think it would fit you.VIVIAN(beginning to get the
       drift)
    I didn't ask if it would fit.
    I asked how much it was.SALESWOMANIt's very expensive.

  Vivian's body tenses as she stares at the Saleswoman.VIVIANWhat is with you?SALESWOMAN(unblinking)
    Excuse me?VIVIANI'm going to spend money.SALESWOMANI don't think we have anything
    for you here.  You're obviously
    in the wrong place.

  Vivian is speechless.  She turns and stomps toward the door.
  She stops and spins around staring at the Saleswoman.  Vivian
  flips her off.  She throws the door open and storms outside.
  The Saleswoman calmly strolls back to her counter and returns
  to her place.EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAYVivian comes out onto the street and stands, lost.  She takes
  a deep breath, trying to control herself.  Two WOMEN, in elegant
  designer outfits, stroll by, eyeing Vivian as if she were a
  freak.  Vivian suddenly feels naked.  She turns and hurries
  away.INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAYVivian enters the lobby, upset, nervous and paranoid.  She feels
  an emptiness in her stomach at the sight of all the luxury
  around her.  She hurries toward the elevators.

  At the front desk, Mr. Thomas, once again spots her.  He crosses
  the lobby and deftly cuts her off from the elevator.MR. THOMASMay I help you Miss?

  Vivian stops, practically shaking with terror.VIVIANI'm just going to my room.MR. THOMASYou're a guest here?VIVIANI'm -- I'm with a friend.MR. THOMASAnd who is that?VIVIANI... Edward...

  Vivian's face is filled with confusion.  She doesn't know his
  name.  The elevator doors open behind them.  She spots the
  Operator.VIVIAN(blurting it out)
    He knows me.

  Mr. Thomas turns and eyes the Operator curiously.  The Operator
  looks back at them innocently.  With a smooth gesture Mr. Thomas
  waves the Operator over.MR. THOMASDo you know this young lady?

  The Operator nods.OPERATORShe's with Mr. Harris.MR. THOMAS(surprised)
    Mr. Harris?OPERATORShe apparently joined him last
    night.

  Mr. Thomas waves the Operator away.MR. THOMASWhy don't you come with me.  We'll
    chat for just a moment.

  He takes Vivian gently but firmly by the arm and leads her off.INT. HOTEL OFFICE - DAYIn a richly furnished office, Mr. Thomas places Vivian in a
  comfortable chair and then leans against the edge of his desk.MR. THOMASWhat's your name?VIVIANVivian.MR. THOMASMiss Vivian... things that go
    on in other hotels don't happen
    at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.

  Vivian says nothing.

          MR. THOMAS (cont'd)
    Mr. Harris, however, is a very
    special customer.  And we like
    to think of our special customers
    as friends.  As a customer, we
    would expect Mr. Harris to sign
    in any additional guests.  But
    as a friend, we're willing to
    overlook it, I'm assuming you're
    a... relative?

  Vivian finds herself nodding.

          MR. THOMAS (cont'd)
    I thought so.  You must be his...?VIVIANNiece?MR. THOMASOf course.  Naturally when Mr.
    Harris leaves, I won't see you
    in this hotel again.

  Vivian bites her lower lip, nods.

          MR. THOMAS (cont'd)
    Good.  We understand one another.
      (as a gentle
       afterthought:)
    I would also encourage you to
    dress in a more appropriate
    manner.

  Vivian's face screws up as she tries hard not to cry.VIVIANThat's what I was trying to do.

  She can't help it, the tears come.  Vivian pulls out the money
  Edward gave her.  She drops it on the desk.  It's a moist-
  looking wad now.

          VIVIAN (cont'd)
    I was trying to get some other
    clothes... but...
    they wouldn't... they made me feel
    like shit...

  She can't go on.  Mr. Thomas politely glances at the money.
  He unfolds it, smoothes it and hands it back to her.  He sighs.
  He picks up the phone.  He dials.MR. THOMAS(into the phone)
    Women's clothing.

  Vivian is staring at him.

    someone over.  Her name is Vivian.
    She's a guest of ours.  A very
    special guest.

  He glances at Vivian.  With those simple words, he'd made her
  feel better.

          MR. THOMAS (cont'd)
    She's from out of town and she
    needs a little help in dressing.
    Perhaps you could help her out.
    Thank you very much.  She'll be
    right over.

  He sets the phone down and smiles patronizingly at Vivian.

    There you are.  If you have any
    other problems, come ask for me
    personally.  I'm Mr. Thomas.VIVIANBarney.

    permits are still valid and what
    kind of limits are on them.STUCKEYJesus, yes.  It's a long shot but
    if the permits are still in
    effect, they're worth a fortune.

  He turns away.  The other follow Edward back toward the
  stairs.EDWARDWhat time's diner tonight?STUCKEYEight o'clock.  Kross is bringing
    his son.  Very bright kid, watch
    yourself with him.  Who's this
    girl you're taking?EDWARDNo one you know.INT. SAKS - SECOND FLOOR - DAYThe elevator opens and Vivian walks out and surveys the room
  nervously.  She walks toward the women's clothing section.
  BRIDGET, a large friendly woman, spots her and quickly
  approaches.BRIDGETYou must be Vivian.

  Vivian nods.

          BRIDGET (cont'd)
    Let's look at you...

  She steps back, regards Vivian with a professional eye.

          BRIDGET (cont'd)
    Where are you from, dear?VIVIAN(pause)
    Georgia.BRIDGETNo wonder.  For starts, you should
    know that hot pants are horrid,
    even when you do have the legs
    to carry them off.  What are your
    plans while you're in town?VIVIANWell... I might be going out to
    dinner.BRIDGETYou'll want a cocktail dress
    then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful
    figure.  A little too out in the
    open but simply lovely.  Size six?
    Do you need shoes?VIVIANI dunno.  Do thigh high, leather
    boots go with a cocktail dress?BRIDGET(calling out)
    Philip!  We'll need shoes!

  Bridget leads Vivian towards the racks of clothes.  She pulls
  out a dress.BRIDGETYour uncle will like this.VIVIANHe's not really my uncle.BRIDGETThey never are, dear.INT. HOTEL LOBBY - LATE AFTERNOONMr. Thomas is behind the desk.  He looks up.  Vivian is standing

    it.VIVIANI didn't want to get it messed.
    I got shoes too.  Wanna see?MR. THOMASThat's all right.  I'm sure
    they're quite lovely.VIVIANThey were real nice to me there.
    They treated me, y'know... nice.
    Thanks, Barney.

  Mr. Thomas tries not to wince at the familiarity.MR. THOMASYou're very welcome, Miss Vivian.

  She smiles at him.  He watches as Vivian turns and walks toward
  the elevator.  The provocative way her hips move just naturally
  attracts the attention of a MALE PASSERBY.  And the white gloved
  ELEVATOR MAN literally leaps to press the elevator button for
  Vivian who rewards him with a happy smile.  Mr. Thomas sighs.INT. PENTHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOONThe phone is ringing Vivian enters.  She hurries to pick it up.VIVIANHello?

  The phone keeps ringing -- it has more than one line.  Vivian
  frantically punches buttons.

    more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be
    pushed for time so meet me in the
    hotel lobby at seven forty-five
    sharp.  Got it?VIVIANNo, I don't "got it".  Even the
    farmboys back in Georgia come to

    on a date.EDWARDThis isn't a date.VIVIANGo by yourself then.  Where you
    taking me anyway?EDWARDThe Rex.VIVIANAny good?EDWARDI think you'll approve.VIVIAN... all right.  I'll meet you in
    the lobby.  But only cause you're
    paying me to.EDWARDThank you very much.

  Vivian slowly sets the phone down.  The phone rings again.
  Vivian, very carefully, punches the flashing button and picks
  it up.VIVIANHello?EDWARDI thought I told you not to answer
    the phone.VIVIANOooh!

  Edward hangs up.  He smiles to himself.

  Vivian bites her fingernails, looking nervous.  The doorbell
  RINGS.  Vivian looks up, startled.  She rises, moves to answer
  it.

  It's the Spanish MAID.  She nods politely at Vivian.MAIDHousekeeping.  I come to turn
    down the bed.  5:00, I turn down
    the bed.VIVIANWhat?

  The Maid points to her hotel badge, trying to explain.MAIDHousekeeping.  I come to turn

  Consuelo shrugs.INT. HOTEL LOBBY - LATE AFTERNOONMr. Thomas is still behind the desk, working when a soft voice
  startles him.VIVIANBarney.

  He looks up.  He sighs.  Vivian still hasn't changed.MR. THOMASWhat is it, Miss Vivian?VIVIANEdward is taking me to some fancy
    place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever

  Mr. Thomas swallows his exasperation.

  WE PULL BACK from their table to reveal the cavernous, empty
  banquets room, each table is set and ready for the dinner
  service.MR. THOMASMiss Vivian --VIVIANMaybe I'll just order a burger,
    Barney, that way I can eat with
    my hands.MR. THOMASMiss Vivian... there's a salon

    worrying unnecessarily about table
    manners, why don't you just have
    your hair done instead?VIVIANProfessionally?INT. SALON - LATE AFTERNOONVivian sits in a salon chair.  The last customer, THANE, a
  young man of about twenty with his long hair pulled back in a
  pony tail, tilts her head one way and then another, eyeing her
  professionally.VIVIANI have a friend who has a friend
    who does Cher's wigs.THANEI hate him already.

  Edward crosses to a house phone and picks it up.  He's about
  to dial when:MR. THOMASGood evening, Mr. Harris.

  Edward looks at him blankly.MR. THOMASBarnard Thomas, manager of the
    hotel.EDWARDOf course, yes.  If you'll excuse
    me just a moment --MR. THOMASI have a message for you from your
    "niece", sir.EDWARDMy what?MR. THOMASThe young lady staying in your
    room?

  Edward's eyes narrow.  He hangs up the phone.EDWARDI think we both know she's not
    my niece.

  Mr. Thomas looks uncomfortable.

          EDWARD (cont'd)
    Does this hotel have any problem
    with that?MR. THOMASMr. Harris, a guest of yours, is
    a guest of ours and shall be
    treated accordingly.  The young
    lady asked me to tell you that
    she is waiting for you in the
    lounge.EDWARDThank you.

  He starts towards the lounge.MR. THOMASVery intriguing young woman, Miss
    Vivian.

  His tone stops Edward in his tracks.

          MR. THOMAS (cont'd)
    Have a good evening, sir.

  And off he goes, leaving Edward to wonder what the hell
  transpired during the afternoon.INT. HOTEL LOUNGE - NIGHTEdward enters the lounge.  He looks around, not seeing Vivian.
  And suddenly his eyes go back to... the beautiful girl with the
  beautifully styled hair in the beautiful black cocktail dress
  at the piano bar.  Edward tries to hide his surprise as Vivian
  rises, moves elegantly towards him.  She smiles.VIVIANYou're late.

  Such a beautiful woman deserves an apology and so, without
  thinking:EDWARDI'm sorry.VIVIANYou're forgiven.

  She waits expectantly.  He holds out an arm.  She takes it.INT. REX RESTAURANT - NIGHTVivian comes out of the ladies room.  She walks forward past
  the MAITRE'D'S station.  She stops.  She takes a breath... and
  then walks forward.INT. REX - ANOTHER ANGLE - LOOKING DOWNVivian moves down a marble starircase, through the elegant
  restaurant toward a far table.  Her beauty and natural grace
  draw approving stares.  She is like a queen moving through a
  ballroom.

  At a secluded table, Edward sits in conversation with two men.
  JAMES KROSS, in his early 70's, a bulky self-made millionaire
  industrialist.  Sitting next to him is his son and second in
  command, DAVID KROSS, a handsome man in his early thirties.
  All of them rise as Vivian comes to the table.  David Kross
  holds out Vivian's chair for her.  Surprised, she nods her
  thanks.  In front of her is an enormous placesetting.  She
  smiles down at the utensils, filled with confidence.

  Waiters have placed a delicate salad down in front of each of
  them.  Vivian proudly reaches for her salad fork.  But then she
  sees that Kross has picked up the fork closest to his plate and
  is digging into his salad with that.

  Vivian looks to see what Edward will do.  He doesn't seem
  interested in eating yet.  Neither does David Kross.  Feeling
  a sudden panic, Vivian puts her fork down.KROSSSo young man, I understand you
    are trying to take over my
    company.

  A moment.  The abruptness of the question takes Edward back for
  a moment.  But then he almost smiles.EDWARDPlease don't patronize me, Mr.
    Kross.  Our ages mean nothing
    here.

  Kross and David look at each other.DAVIDMr. Harris, we know you've
    purchased at least twenty percent
    of our stock.  We also know you
    plan to file a formal bid for a
    majority share.EDWARDTwenty-five percent.KROSSMr. Harris, I built Kross
    Enterprises myself.  I know every
    man who ever worked there by his
    first name.  I know their wives...
    and their children.  If your
    intention is to take over my
    company and turn it into a
    glorified real estate deal, think
    again.

  Edward, thankfully, now reaches for his salad fork and begins
  to eat.  Relieved, Vivian picks up hers.  They all eat for a
  moment.EDWARDWhat do you suggest, Mr. Kross?

  WAITERS approach, some to clear the salad plates, some to put
  down the next course.  Vivian, thinking she's got to finish,
  quickly stuffs her mouth with the rest of her salad.  She is
  reluctant to let the Waiter take her fork.KROSSWhat would it take to buy our
    stock back?  Name your price.EDWARDTo get me in a mood to sell --
    double what I paid.  But your
    company doesn't have enough
    capital right now to buy anything.DAVIDWe're on the verge of closing
    a large navy contract.  Double
    is ridiculous but we can assure
    you a healthy profit on your
    shares.  We would give you a
    promissory note...EDWARDYou're not getting any navy
    contracts.

  Vivian can see that both father and son are stunned by this
  news.DAVIDThere's no way you could know
    that.EDWARDBut I do know.  I also know your
    lines of credit are over-extended.
    If I don't buy your company,
    someone else will...
      (looking up)
    Ah, the escargot.

  Escargot are put down in front of everyone.  Vivian stares at
  them dubiously.  She picks up what she assumes is the next
  "right" fork.  She picks up a snail.  The two do not fit.
  Flustered, she doesn't know what to do.  No one else seems to
  be eating.  And now a Waiter comes and places escargot forks
  at each place.  Vivian picks it up with a sigh of relief.VIVIAN(softly, to the Waiter)
    Scume me, what are these things?WAITER(bending to whisper)
    Escargot, mademoiselle.EDWARD(leaning close to
       whisper)
    Snails.

  Vivian stares at them, horrified.  She, like James and David
  Kross, no longer seem interested in eating.  Edward eats with
  pleasure.EDWARDMr. Kross, I'm not here to sell
    you my stock.  On the contrary,
    I'm here to buy yours.KROSS(angry)
    You've got a lot of nerve.EDWARDNo.  What I have is a lot of
    money.KROSSI know all about you, Mr. Harris.
    When you buy companies, they have
    a way of disappearing.  Even the
    pension funds are stripped clean.
    The last three companies you took
    over were cut up in so many
    pieces, widows were left without
    their retirement checks.EDWARD(calmly)
    What I did with those companies
    was perfectly legal.KROSSI don't question the legality
    of what you do.  It's your
    morality that makes me sick.  I
    will not allow my company to be
    raped by a man like you.EDWARD(angry now)
    It is not your company.  It's a
    public company.  And I am going
    to acquire it.  Either I buy from
    the other stock holders, or I buy
    from you.

  Vivian struggles with her escargot.

          EDWARD (cont'd)
    I would suggest that you and your
    board cooperate with me, rather
    than fight a battle you don't have
    the ammunition to win.

  Vivian suddenly ZINGS her snail across the table.  Everyone
  looks to her.VIVIANSlippery little suckers...

  Kross rises.KROSSIf you'll excuse me young lady,
    Mr. Harris...
      (turns to David)
    Deal with this, David, you know
    where we stand.  I need to go
    someplace and puke.

  He rises.  He exits.DAVID(to Edward and Vivian)
    Men like my father built this
    country.  He was no saint.  He
    screwed people.  But for every
    guy he stepped on, he gave a
    hundred a good job.

  Edward is silent.VIVIANHe seems like a nice man.

  David looks at Vivian as if seeing her for the first time.EDWARDWe can reach an understanding on
    this.DAVIDI don't think so.  You should
    know we're going to fight you with
    every resource we have.EDWARDDo what you have to do.  I don't
    take it personally.DAVIDI do.  I take it all very
    personally.
      (to Vivian)
    Very nice meeting you, Vivian.

  David Kross gets up and leaves.  Vivian and Edward sit in
  silence.EDWARD(a beat)
    And that's the way the game is
    played.VIVIANSome game.  Screwin' some poor
    slob out of his retirement.

  Edward says nothing.  But Vivian can see she's hit a nerve.VIVIANSnails for dinner.  No wonder
    everybody is in such a bad mood.

  A Waiter appears at the table.WAITERAre we ready for the next course,
    sir?EDWARDNo.  Bring a check, please.INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHTEdward's face is pensive and thoughtful as he stares out of
  the glass window down at the city lights.  He quickly drains
  his champagne glass.  Vivian moves to stand next to him.
  She refills his glass from the bottle.EDWARDThank you.

  He drinks.  Silence.VIVIANYou're upset, huh?EDWARDUpset.  No.  I never get upset
    about business.VIVIANYou liked the guy, though.EDWARDWhether I liked him or not is
    irrelevant.  It's business.
    There's no emotion involved in
    business... if you want to
    survive.VIVIAN(excited)
    We're the exactly the same!  Kit
    keeps telling me don't get
    emotional when you turn tricks
    -- that's why no kissing -- it's
    too personal.
    The key is like you're saying,
    stay numb, don't get involved --
    when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot,
    I just do it.
      (realizing what she's
       saying and quickly
       recovers)
    Except with you.  At your price
    I give my all...

  Edward laughs.

          VIVIAN (cont'd)
    Let's not talks about this heavy
    stuff.  Come on, relax.

  Vivian comes up behind him.  She begins to rub his shoulders.EDWARDThat... is very good.

  A moment.  Edward is silent.  Turns him, unknots his tie,
  unbuttons his collar.VIVIANKnow what we're gonna do in a
    little while then?  We're gonna
    call Domino's and have'm deliver
    a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat
    it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out
    and watch television.EDWARDTelevision?VIVIANYeah, it's this box, it has
    pictures, sound.  You don't have
    to use your brain at all.EDWARDI have work to do.VIVIANUh-uh.  No work.

  Smiling, she softly kisses his throat.

          VIVIAN (cont'd)
    See... what you haven't figured
    out yet...

  She kissed his neck.  She fumbles with his belt.

          VIVIAN (cont'd)
    Is that while you're the boss
    everyplace else... I'm the one
    in charge here.

  She kisses his chest.

          VIVIAN (cont'd)
    You... just think you are.

  She starts to kneel down.  He stops her.  They stare at one
  another for a moment.  He releases her.  She smiles.  She
  starts to undress him.INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - MORNINGVivian is asleep.  She turns over, slowly waking.  Her hand
  goes out to touch Edward and encounters nothing but empty bed.
  Vivian comes awake with a sudden start.  She look around
  momentarily frightened, not sure where she is.  Sighing with
  relief, she lies back down.  She sees Edward's American Express
  card on the pillow next to her.EDWARD (O.S.)Wake up, Vivian.  Time to shop.

  Edward comes out of the bathroom and moves toward the bed.
  He is tying his tie.  Vivian sits up and ties it for him.  He
  smiles at her.EDWARDI still don't understand why you
    only bought one dress.VIVIANI wasn't as much fun as I
    thought it was going to be.EDWARDWhy not?VIVIANWell, you know those cold bitches
    that work in those stores and try
    to intimidate you?  It works.EDWARDWas someone rude to you?VIVIANI had a little problem in one
    store.  I wasn't dressed right.
    I don't know what to say.  I don't
    belong there.  Maybe I'll just
    go back to Bridget.  She was cool.EDWARDVivian, you belong wherever you
    are.  I don't care how you were
    dressed, they were the ones who
    were wrong, not you.

  Edward sits on the bed.

    you unless you respect yourself.

    especially with bankers.  Works
    every time.  Will you try it?VIVIAN(confidently)

  The Salesgirl looks Vivian up and down.  A Pause.  Vivian gives
  her "the stare" and straightens up.  We see the Salesgirl's
  reaction change.VIVIAN(confidently)
    I'm looking for a dress, nothing
    too flashy, not too sexy,
    conservative.  In a size six.SALESGIRL(uncomfortable under

  Vivian smiles and draws out Edward's American Express card.

  find Vivian's size.INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY - IN A SERIES OF CUTSVivian tries on different clothes under Edward and the
  Salesgirl's supervision.

  Vivian comes happily out of the dressing room wearing a low

  Salesgirl holds a classic tweed ensemble over Vivian's outfit.
  Vivian scowls.VIVIAN(sighing)
    I look like fucking Nancy Reagan.INT. BOUTIQUE - ANOTHER ANGLEThe Salesgirl shows Edward clothes by Ann Taylor.  He turns

    on the Kross pension funds.
    There's another forty million
    there.  We can bleed'm dry.

  There is a sudden hesitation in Edward's eyes.  He watches as
  Vivian tries on a hat.  She preens for him.  He smiles.EDWARD(to Vance & Stuckey)
    Put the pension funds on hold
    until I say otherwise.STUCKEY(surprised)

  to him.EDWARD(looks at his watch)
    You're on your own now, Vivian.

  his outstretched arm.  Vivian picks out the brightest one and
  smiles.EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAYVivian's arms are filled with clothing boxes and bags.  She
  feels like she owns the block.  A well-dressed MAN passes by,
  smiling politely.  Vivian's nose lifts as she happily ignores
  him.

  Suddenly Vivian stops.  She's about to pass the shop she was
  thrown out of.  Vivian takes a breath and enters the shop.INT. BOUTIQUE - DAYVivian enters.  The moment she steps through the door, Vivian's
  courage leaves her.

  The saleswoman is waiting on a CUSTOMER.SALESWOMAN(to the customer)
    Isn't this lovely?  I think it
    would look wonderful on you.

  Vivian musters her courage.  She takes a deep breath and starts
  forward.SALESWOMAN(to her customer)
    Would you like to try it on?VIVIAN'Scume me.

  Both the saleswoman and her customer look up.  The saleswoman
  smiles pleasantly.SALESWOMANYes?VIVIANDo you remember me?SALESWOMANNo, I'm sorry, I don't.VIVIANI was in here yesterday.

  Vivian slowly raises her middle finger.  The recognition starts
  to dawn in the saleswoman's eyes.  Vivian's courage begins to
  return.VIVIANYeah.  That's right.  It's me.
    I want you to know something.
    You made me feel terrible. I
    wasn't dressed right and you said
    I didn't belong here.  Well, I
    do.  You're the one that was
    wrong, not me.  And I want to tell
    you something else.  I'm never
    gonna shop here again as long as
    I live.

  And with that, Vivian turns and walks out.

  The saleswoman is stunned.  A beat.  The customer thrusts the
  dress into the saleswoman's arm as if offended by Vivian's
  speech and leaves the store also.INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAYMr. Thomas looks up from the desk.  And stares.  Vivian and a
  BELLHOP stroll through the hotel entrance and across the hotel

  himself.INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAYVivian opens the front door for the Bellhop who carries in her
  packages.  She motions for him to place them on the couch.  He

  meeting table.  He is serving himself coffee from a tray.STUCKEY(gloating)
    You were right.  Kross mortgaged

    grandson's college tuition to
    secure loans from a bank.  Not

    with.

  Edward just sips his coffee.

          STUCKEY (cont'd)
    It goes without saying that your
    business means a great deal more
    to them than our friend Kross's.

    All you have to do is make a call.

  Edward is silent.  Stuckey is again surprised.STUCKEYExcuse me for saying this but what
    is wrong with you this week?
    First, you go soft on the pension

  beautiful, candlelit, food laden table has been set up in the
  middle of the room.  Champagne and wine chills in a bucket.
  A fire burns in the fireplace.  Music is playing.VIVIAN (O.S.)Hi.

  Edward turns.  And stares again.  Vivian stands in the bedroom
  doorway.  She is wearing an exquisite silk dressing gown.  She
  looks incredibly beautiful.VIVIANI thought maybe you'd like dinner.EDWARDThank you.  I would.
      (he fingers her dressing
       gown)
    Nice.VIVIANWait till you see what I have
    on underneath.EDWARDPlease.

  She opens the dressing gown.  What she has on underneath is
  absolutely nothing.  Edward crosses to her.  Taking her in his
  arms, he lifts her up and kisses her breasts.VIVIANWhat about dinner?EDWARDDinner can wait.INT. PENTHOUSE BATHROOM - NIGHTThe bathroom is lit by candles.  Vivian and Edward are in the
  marble tub.  Vivian sits behind Edward.  She lazily washes his

    to get used to, huh?EDWARDEasier than learning how to be
    poor.

    another woman.  And he took his
    money with him.

  Silence.VIVIANKeep talkin'.  I like hearin'.EDWARDNot much to tell.  I went to

  socialites, aficionados -- most of whom ignore the game.  They
  are there to see and be seen much more than to watch a polo
  match.EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - LATER AFTERNOONVivian and Edward make their way towards the party.  Edward is
  wearing his new tie.  Vivian is looking very chic and beautiful
  in one of her new outfits.  Not that it's helping -- the place,

  overwhelmed.  She suddenly stops.VIVIANYou're really pushing it,

  passing WAITERS's tray, he starts forward.EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOONA WOMANWe're good together.  He has to

    No question, no arguments, no

  That makes Vivian think.  And then she smiles as she sees Edward
  approaching.  Vivian moves to him.VIVIANEdward, these women here, I don't
    think any of'm like the guys
    they're with.  They're just into

  clothes, replacing divots and stepping over the horse shit.
  In a corner of the field, grazing horses stare, seemingly in
  disbelief.

  Vivian is having a wonderful time.  And then, as she moves
  towards the outside of the crowd she sees someone staring at

  up.  She parts the thigh high slit in her gown to expose silken

    And boy, was he good looking,
    y'know, dark hair and eyes.
    The chicken hawks were on him all
    the time.  He hated that.
    Sometimes we'd find a safe place
    to crash nights and we'd curl up
    together and we'd talk about all
    these crazy things.  The two of
    us getting married someday.
    Having kids.  Stupid stuff.EDWARDWhat happened to him?

  A moment.  Vivian shrugs.VIVIANMy father found me.  Dragged me

    when you're sitting way up high.

  Edward moves close to Vivian and putting an arm around her
  shoulders, stares with her out at the view.  Vivian rests her
  head against him.EXT. SAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - NIGHTAn airport limo pulls to a stop in front of the San Francisco
  Opera House.  The DRIVER walks around back and opens the
  passenger door.  Edward emerges and helps Vivian out.INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE LOBBY - NIGHTEdward puts his hand on Vivian's elbow as they walk through
  the elegant lobby.EDWARDSome people say that opera is an
    acquired taste, but I don't
    believe it.  You can always tell
    when someone goes to the opera
    for the first time.  They either
    love it or hate it.  Those who
    love it will always love it; those
    who hate it might come to
    appreciate it, but they'll never
    truly love it.

  Vivian is wide eyed as they walk past a beautifully lit
  fountain with several graceful statues in its center.
  Everywhere she looks she sees elegantly dressed WOMEN and
  prosperous looking MEN.  It makes her nervous.  Without
  realizing it, she raises a protective hand up to her necklace.
  She looks as if she suspects someone is going to step up and
  steal it.EDWARDViv?  I really doubt if anyone
    here is going to try and grab it.

  Vivian reluctantly lowers her hands.INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE LOBBY - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHTA crowd of PEOPLE mill around the lobby, heading toward their
  seats.  Vivian is aware of the looks she draws as she passes
  -- curious, even envious looks from the WOMEN, appreciative
  glances from the MEN.  Her hands again rises nervously to her
  necklace.EDWARDThey all think you look very
    beautiful, Vivian.

  Vivian gives him a grateful look.  Relaxing, she lowers her hand
  from the necklace.  With a flourish, he offers his arm.  She
  takes it.  They start forward.INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE BOX - NIGHTEdward and Vivian take their seats in a box high above the
  stage.VIVIANIf it's in Italian, how will I
    know what they're saying?EDWARDI'll whisper some of the main
    parts of the story to you.  But
    you'll be surprised how much you
    understand.  The music conveys
    the story more powerfully than
    any words.VIVIANBut don't they have it in
    English?EDWARDVivian, don't be afraid of what
    you don't know.  That's the fun
    of it.

  The lights dim.VIVIAN(resigned)
    Okay.  Even if I hate it, I'm
    glad you brought me.

  The orchestra begins to play.  Vivian's eyes focus intensely
  on the stage, as if a new world is about to be revealed to her.INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE STATE - NIGHTIN A MONTAGE OF IMAGES AND MUSIC - LA BOHEME is performed.

  The lights from the stage dance across Vivian's face.  Edward
  leans over to translate the tenor's aria.EDWARDWhat am I?  I am a poet.  Not
    a man of wealth but one rich in
    dreams.  You have come to replace
    my vanished dreams.  I dwell now
    only in your eyes.

  The MUSIC ebbs and swells.  The sets and costumes change.  The
  story continues.

  Edward again leans close to Vivian.EDWARDAnd now she asks Rudolpho if he
    still thinks her beautiful --

  Vivian raises a hand and gently covers Edward's mouth.  Her eyes
  are fixed on the stage.  She doesn't need his help.

  The emotions building inside Vivian swell as the music is
  reaching its tragic climax.  Her lips tremble.  Her eyes fill
  with tears.  Edward glances at her.  He studies her a long
  moment, watching the emotions play unashamedly across her face.
  Strangely moved, he takes Vivian's hand.

  As the opera ends, they are both swept away by it.INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE BOX - NIGHTAs the lights come up, Vivian wipes off her tear-ruined
  mascara.  She sighs, happy.  The WOMEN in the next box smile
  at her.OLDER WOMANDid you enjoy the opera, dear?VIVIAN(tearfully)
    It was so beautiful I just about
    pissed my pants.

  Edward smiles at the now shocked looking Older Woman and he
  and the still misty Vivian exit.INT. CORPORATE JET - NIGHT - LATEREdward and Vivian sit side by side.EDWARDIf you'd gone on about how much

    have believed you.VIVIANI more than liked it.EDWARDI know.  I'm glad.VIVIANDid you?EDWARDYes.  I've never enjoyed it more.
    Thank you.

  Vivian looks at him a moment.  And then, leaning slowly forward
  she kisses him gently on the mouth.  He looks at her surprise.
  He puts his arms around her and kisses her back.  It is the
  first time they've kissed and they make it very special.EXT. CORPORATE JET - NIGHTThe plane flies in the night.  Back to L.A.INT. REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHTIN A SERIES OF CROSS FADES Edward and Vivian make love.

  Edward cradles Vivian.  Her back rests against his chest.  His
  arm is over her body.

  She takes Edward's hand in her hands and carefully examines
  it; marveling at the fingers, the tiny hairs on the back.  She
  gently kisses the palm.VIVIANLove you...

  She clutches Edward's hand tightly to her breast.  She closes
  her eyes, ready to sleep now.INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - ANGLE ON EDWARD - NIGHTHis eyes open.  Vivian's whispered endearment has filled with
  him with sudden confusion and uncertainty.  He stares into the
  dark, wondering what to do with the woman in his arms.INT. PENTHOUSE - OUTDOOR PATIO - MORNINGThe phone rings.  Edward immediately reaches out and picks it
  up.  He is dressed in a robe.  Breakfast is on the umbrella'd

    this.  He wants to see you.
    Today.EDWARDWhy?STUCKEYHe wouldn't say.  Edward... I
    think we got him.  His nuts are
    on the block and we got him.

    You there?EDWARDGive me twenty minutes.STUCKEYWe'll be there.  Listen, if he's
    really caving in, we'll go from
    there down to the office.  I want
    him to commit his stock to us this
    morning.

  Edward hangs up.  His mind seems on other things.  He rises.INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - MORNINGVivian is still asleep.  She is face down on the bed, the
  sheets just covering her to her waist.  Edward stares down at
  her.  He gently reaches out and runs a finger down the soft line
  of her spine.  Vivian murmurs contentedly.VIVIANMmm.
      (opening her eyes;
       looking at him)
    Hi.

  Edward smiles at her softly.  And then:EDWARDBetter get dressed.  We're having
    guests.INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - DAYVivian is wearing her yellow dress.  She stares at herself in
  the bedroom mirror.  Her hair... her make-up... she realizes
  how different she is now, realizes that she likes it.

  Edward comes out of the bathroom.  He crosses to the closet
  for a tie.VIVIANHere.  Let me.

  She comes over, starts to tie his tie for him.  He is very
  aware of the closeness of her.  She smiles at him.  He smiles;
  puts his hand on her stopping her for a moment.  Looking up,
  she sees that he is serious now; no more jokes.  He releases
  her hand.EDWARD(quietly)
    One more night and you're finally
    rid of me.VIVIANYeah, you've been pretty tough
    to take.EDWARDI have to go to New York
    tomorrow.

  Vivian says nothing.

          EDWARD (cont'd)
    But I'll be back in Los Angeles.
    Soon.  I'd like to see you again.
    I thought we could work out
    something... An arrangement.

  Vivian is silent.

          EDWARD (cont'd)
    I'll get you an apartment, buy
    you a car --

  Vivian sighs, letting something go inside.  Finished with his
  tie, she turns away.

          EDWARD (cont'd)
    What is it?VIVIAN(not unkindly)
    What else?  You gonna leave some
    cash by the bed when you pass
    through town?EDWARDIt wouldn't be like that.  I want
    to get you off the street.  You'll
    have a different kind of life.
    What's wrong with that?VIVIANI'm sorry.  That's very sweet,
    Edward, and I know you mean it...

  She is silent.EDWARDVivian, I've thought about this
    a lot.  This is the best solution.VIVIAN(shakes her head "no,"
       then continues tying
       his tie)
    When I was a little girl, my
    mother locked me in the attic when
    I was bad, which was pretty often.
    I'd stare out the window up there
    and make believe I was a princess
    trapped in the tower by the wicked
    queen.  Then suddenly a knight
    on a white horse with his bright
    colors flying would ride up.
    Rescue me from the tower, and then
    we'd ride off... but never, ever
    in all the times I had that dream
    did the knight say, "Come on baby,
    I'll put you up in a great condo."

  She finished his tie.EDWARDVivian, life's not a fairy tale.VIVIAN(softly; to herself)
    I know.
      (a beat)
    Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being
    stupid.
      (more)
    I'll think about it, okay?  It's
    a real good offer for a whore.EDWARDI've never treated you like a
    whore.VIVIAN(not mean)
    You just did.

  The doorbell suddenly rings in the living room.INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAYEdward enters the living room.  Vivian slowly enters behind
  him.  Edward opens the front door.  Mr. Kross slowly enters.
  He looks very old and tired; so much so that Edward has to mask
  his surprise.KROSSMr. Harris.EDWARDHow are you, Mr. Kross.KROSSNot bad for a man who hasn't
    slept in four nights.  I'll get
    used to it.

  An angry, reluctant looking David Kross is behind his father.
  Stuckey brings up the rear.  Edward and David give one another
  perfunctory nod.  Stuckey smugly winks at Edward.  Edward closes
  the door and leads them all down the stairs.

  Vivian is very troubled at Kross's appearance.  He gently nods
  at Vivian.KROSSYoung lady.VIVIANHello.
      (to David)
    Hi.DAVIDHello, Vivian.STUCKEYLet's not waste time here, shall
    we?  Mr. Kross, you said this
    morning, you wished to speak with
    Mr. Harris.  Mr. Harris is now
    listening.

  Kross has to fight down his humiliation at Stuckey's tone.  He
  turns to Edward.KROSSYes.  I'm here to tell you that
    I've reconsidered my position on
    your acquisition offer.EDWARDExpected... offer.KROSSOf course, yes.  After the
    expected filing period is over,
    I'm going to recommend to the
    board that we accept your bid.EDWARD(a moment)
    You're making the right decision,
    sir.

  Stuckey glances triumphantly at Edward.  He is surprised to
  see that there doesn't seem to be any victory in Edward's face.
  Edward is silent.  Kross interprets his silence as second
  thoughts.KROSSI'll see you on one condition.
    I'm not so concerned for me but
    the people who have worked for
    me...

  Vivian is disturbed watching this tired looking man.STUCKEY(quickly)
    They'll be taken care of.  Won't
    they, Edward?

  Kross ignores Stuckey.  He looks to Edward.  Edward slowly
  nods.KROSSI'll sign anything you want then.STUCKEYToday.

  Kross nods tiredly.  His voice is very soft.KROSSToday.

  Vivian abruptly turns and disappears into the bedroom,
  obviously upset.  The men all watch her go.  Edward hesitates.
  He turns to Kross:EDWARDExcuse me, please?

  He heads to the bedroom.INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - DAYVivian is sitting on the bed, on the phone.VIVIANHello.  Is Kit DeLuca there?
    When she comes in will you have
    her call Vivian Wells at 560-30000.
    Yes.  Okay.

  She hangs up as Edward comes in.VIVIANWhat did you do to him?EDWARDWhat do you mean?VIVIANLast time I saw him he was this
    strong guy.  Now he's beaten.
    And you liked him.EDWARDVivian, I want you to listen to
    me.  The man realized that it
    would be better for his future
    and his son's future, if he
    cooperated.VIVIANRight.EDWARDIt's not your concern.  It's...
    business, that's all.VIVIANBusiness.EDWARDYes.  The man made a business
    decision.VIVIANIt's all just business to you.
    Him.  Me.  Your life.
    Everything's business.EDWARDIt's what I do for a living.

  expectantly.EDWARDWe'll continue this down at the

    someone here to see you.VIVIANMe?MR. THOMASI'd send them up, but sadly, I
    don't trust the young lady to find
    you on her own.

  A hand reaches out and wrenches the phone away from Mr. Thomas.
  Kit, heavy make-up, skimpy outfit, chewing gum, cigarette and
  all, keeps her voice just below a bellow.KITViv?  Where are you, babe?
      (glaring at Mr. Thomas)
    The sphincter-police won't let

    I blame myself here.  First time
    I laid eyes on ya', I knew you
    were too complicated to be a
    whore.

  Vivian nods.  Her face is filled with confusion.INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAYEdward stands at the window looking out.  There is something
  about his somber demeanor that both reflects the look we've just
  seen on Vivian and suggests the way we saw him at the top of
  the story.

  Jake enters, a pile of papers under his arm.  He begins laying
  them out on the conference table.JAKECongratulations, sir.EDWARDWhat?JAKEMr. Kross is just getting off
    the phone with his stock broker.
    It's finished.  You've won.

  Edward says nothing.JAKEWho are you going after next, sir?EDWARDWho indeed...

  He turns as Stuckey, James and David Kross, and Vance enter
  the room.  They surround a conference table.  Kross sits, the
  papers laid out in front of him.  Stuckey hands Kross a pen.
  A SECRETARY lays out finger food.  They wait for her to leave
  before they speak.STUCKEYIf we can get these letters of
    intent out of the way now... Mr.

    inappropriate.  You're under no
    obligation to answer any questions
    at all.KROSSCould we at least wait till after

  Stuckey glances to Edward for help.  Edward is silent; indeed
  it's as if something is twisting inside of him.  Stuckey plunges
  ahead.STUCKEYMr. Harris is preparing a bid
    based on our speculation of the
    corporation's net worth.  The
    price he ultimately pays for your
    father's stock will be based on

    higher our bid can be.KROSSIt's in my best interest to

  He exits.  A moment.  Kross looks at Edward with a resigned
  smile.KROSSHe's young.  He hasn't learned
    how to lose gracefully yet.  I'll

    looking for Edward.

  Vivian just stares at him.VIVIANEdward's not back.  I thought
    he was with you.

  Stuckey walks past her and down the steps into the living room.STUCKEYNo, I'll just have to wait then,
    won't I?

  There is a bar set up.  Stuckey sets his briefcase down.  He
  crosses to the bar.

          STUCKEY (cont'd)
    Mind if I have a drink?VIVIANNo.

  He pours liquor in a glass.  He fires it down.  It seems to
  calm him a bit.STUCKEYDo you want to know what he did?
    Do you want to know what the crazy
    son of a bitch did?  He handed
    the whole thing back to Kross!
    On a silver platter.  For no
    reason!  What was he thinking,
    I mean, what was going through
    his goddam head?  Why?
      (pours another drink)
    What was all that benevolent
    crap?  What are we going to
    become, a philanthropic

  Stuckey glares at Vivian.STUCKEYI bet.  A lousy whore and you're
    the gum in a hundred million

  He looks at her a moment.STUCKEYBut what do I know, maybe you're
    worth it.  Come on, show me.

  He grabs her wrist.VIVIANGet out!STUCKEYDon't worry.  I'll pay for it.
    What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty,
    thirty, fifty bucks, maybe?  Are
    you a fifty dollar whore?

  He tries to kiss her and pulls her down on the couch on top
  of him.VIVIANAre you crazy?

  She bites his hand.  Stuckey slaps her.  Vivian starts flailing
  back.  But Stuckey is too strong.  Vivian staggers back at the
  force of another slap.  Stuckey slams her up against a wall and
  starts rubbing up against her.STUCKEYYou got a mean streak in you,
    don't you.

  He tries to kiss her again.

          STUCKEY (cont'd)

  his head, startled.INT. PENTHOUSE - REVERSE ANGLE - STUCKEY'S P.O.V.Edward, murder in his eyes, belts Stuckey across the room.INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT - BACK TO SCENEStuckey falls on the ground.  Edward rushes forward, berserk

  Stuckey's head, hurting Edward's hand more than Stuckey's skull.

  Vivian rushes out of room to bathroom.  Again Stuckey tries
  to rise.  Edward kicks him in the butt, sends him headfirst into
  the bar.  Glasses and bottles CRASH to the floor.  Stuckey again
  tries to rise.  And collapses.  Edward rubs his fist.  They're
  not used to this violence and both stare at each other panting.STUCKEYYou broke my nose.EDWARDI think I broke my hand.

  A moment.  Edward reaches for his wallet.  He counts out bills.
  He places them in Vivian's suitcase.  He puts his arms around
  Vivian.VIVIANAw, don't... no...EDWARDStay with me tonight.  Not

    building.EXT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAYThe limo pulls to a stop in front of a rundown apartment
  building on a dirty Hollywood side street.  The Limo Driver,
  a large Latino man, steps out of the car and walks around to
  the passenger door.  As he does, he surveys the surroundings
  uncomfortably.  Ths is rough neighborhood.  He opens the door.
  Vivian steps out.LIMO DRIVERMaybe I should go with you.  This
    doesn't look like a good place
    for a lady to be alone.

  Several PEOPLE pass.  All of them stare at the car, at the
  driver, at Vivian in her lovely clothes.VIVIANI'll be okay.  I'm home.  Thank
    you.

  The driver, confused, watches her hurry up the steps to the
  apartment building.  He drives off.INT. APARTMENT LOBBY - DAYVivian walks toward her apartment.  The Landlord is sitting
  at the front desk in a dirty undershirt.LANDLORDHey, we announce guests here.

  dressed now, ready for travel.  There is something about his
  expression, his somber demeanor that suggests the way we saw
  him at the very top of the story.  A BELLMAN enters from the
  bedroom, rolling a luggage loaded dolly along in front of him.BELLMANIs that everything, sir?EDWARD(turning from the
       window)
    That's everything.

  Kit nods at her.KITHey, how you doin'.  You new,
    huh?GIRLYeah.  Got a cigarette?KITSure.

  She passes the girl down the pack.  She strikes a match, lights
  her cigarette for her.  The girl inhales deep, lets it out with
  a sigh.  She looks towards the window.GIRLJeez, did the wacko in the suit.

  They turn and walk away.  Edward stands there, not knowing
  what to do next.  He looks discouraged and lost.KIT (O.S.)Edward Harris, as I live and
    breathe!

  Edward quickly turns to find Kit staring at him.  Kit smiles,
  triumphantly.

          KIT (cont'd)
    Yeah.  Boy, you're just like she
    said.

  Edward follows Kit.INT.  VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - DAYVivian sits on her bed, lost in thought.  Her bags are packed,
  ready to go.  With a sigh she rises.  She picks up the bags,
  exits the room.

  Vivian stands in the dreary living room, looking at it, taking
  it all in for the last time.  She suddenly looks more than a
  little bit frightened to be leaving.  She musters resolve.  She
  goes to the door, opens it and exits, closing it behind her.
  Silence.  Vivian suddenly comes back in.  She puts down her
  bags.  She crosses to the kitchen where she takes coffee
  can/piggy bank from the shelf.  She puts some more bills into
  it, places it back where Kit will find it.

  She turns and starts again for the door.

  She stops.  She hears something.  MUSIC.  An aria from La
  Boheme.  Faint.  Seemingly coming from nowhere.  She dismisses
  it -- she's hearing things.  She opens the door.  Stops.  The
  music is louder and getting louder now -- it's not her
  imagination.  She hurries over to the window.EXT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAYVivian comes out onto the fire escape.  She stares in wonder.

  A snow white limo comes up the street.  A necktie has been tied
  to the antennae like a knight's token.  The MUSIC from La Boheme
  is BLARING from the car's stereo.  Edward is standing on the
  car's seat, his head and body up through the open sunroof.  The
  wind blows at his hair.  He is smiling.

  Everywhere on the street people are staring; the BUMS, the
  PUSHERS, the PASSERBY'S, the TOURISTS.

  Vivian doesn't know whether to laugh or cry.

  The car comes to a stop in front of the Vivian's building.
  Vivian's landlord comes out the front door.  His eyes go wide
  in disbelief.

  Edward disembarks from the limo by coming up through the
  sunroof.  He leaps nimbly to the ground.  He crosses to the entrance
  of the alleyway, looking up at Vivian on the fire escape.VIVIANYou are really lost this time.

  Edward wordlessly holds up a hand for her.

  With a sudden cry of joy, Vivian comes down the fire escape.
  She stops at the bottom stair.  Edward comes forward and sweeps
  her into his arms.  They kiss.

  He carries her to the limo as if she's weightless.  Her feet
  never touch the ground.

  The car door closes behind them.  The limo drives away.

  The people of the street watch it go.THE END--------------------------------------------------------------
