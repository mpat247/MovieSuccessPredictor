          stretch of country shore , and a quiet, sheltered island is visible
          distantly across the Sound. There is asense of anticipation,
          excitement. VOICES can be heard. THE CAMERA is the POV of a VIDEO
          CAMERA, and a group of college kids wait just o.s. On-screen, however,
          for the moment, a proper, sweet-faced young COED faces the camera and
          -- reluctantly, under the urging of her friend behind the video lens -
          - sets the scene.SWEET COED(SHYLY)Hi... My name is Mary O'Reilly O'Toole O'Shea and...over there is the
          island my friend Muffy owns... It's spring break... and she's invited
          us over for the weekend, and we're waiting for the ferry now to take
          us there...
           (blushing, mortified to cameraman)
          I don't know what else to say!CAMERAMAN (CHAZ'S VOICE)Tell us something about yourself.SWEET COEDSomething about myself? Oh, Gee...
          (composing herself, earnestly)
          Well, I want to work with handicapped children... My parents are my
          best Friends... Next semester I start convent school, and I... fuck on
          the first date.
                         
          O.S. her friends explode with LAUGHTER. Brassy former deb NIKKI
          BRASHEARS gives us a big, wet wink, dropping the act.SWEET COED/NIKKIApril Fool...CHAZ'S VOICEWhoo! Outrageous woman! Nikki, you are my kind o' gal!
                         
          He PANS THE CAMERA over to KIT-- a pretty, unaffected, natural beauty,
          bright and very much aware.CHAZ'S VOICEC'mon, Kit, how about you?
                         
          Kit waves him off, laughing in spite of herself. She's got nothing to
          say.KITPass.CHAZ'S VOICEC'mon , Arch? Skip?
                         
          He PANS over to the other two college boys on the dock here - ARCH, a
          big, good-natured, easygoing WASP jock (rugby and crew); and SKIP, Mr.
          Preppy, the perfect image of the lazy spoiled, indulged, and reckless
          upper-crust kid. Skip also happens to be Muffy's cousin.ARCH(ponders it with due consideration)
          Yeah, sure... I fuck on the first date...
                         
          Skip cracks up. Arch's laughter follows.NIKKI (O.S.)Where's Rob?
                         
          Chaz QUICK-PANS the camera back to Kit, following the action.CHAZ'S VOICE(teasing, with innuendo)
          Yeah, Kit, where is he?ARCH (O.S.)(MORE TEASING)Oh, Kit...
                         
          Concerned, Kit keeps her humor anyway, waving the lens away again.KITOh, c'mon, Chaz, give me some room, will you?
                         
          He does, finally shutting down the videopak. The image reverts to FILM
          again.NIKKI(looks at her, persisting)
          Well?INT. VOLVO WAGON IN MOTION - MAIN HIGHWAY - DAYCUT TO:The driver -- a still great-looking, turned-out Fairfield County-type

          goodlooking, 20 year old public school grad �sit in uncomfortable
          silence on opposite ends of the front seat.ROB(gestures, awkwardly)
          Here'll be fine, thanks...EXT. HIGHWAY INTERSECTION - DAYThe Volvo wagon pulls over. Rob drags out his daypack, too.ROB(ABASHED)Thanks... for the lift, I mean...SUBURBAN LADY(smiles, no reason for disappointment)
          It was a real lift for me, too, hon.
                         
          A late model Detroit sedan slows at the intersection, turning off the
          highway to take the junction in the direction Rob is going. A road
          sign indicates: "BAR HARBOR MOUNT DESERT" in another direction.
                         
          Rob hefts his gear, hurrying to flag the sedan.
                         
          The Volvo wagon continues on, braking for the next undergraduate
          male hitchhiking down the road.INT. KITCHEN - ST. JOHN HOUSE- DAYCLOSE ON a wall calendar. A HAND reaches INTO FRAME, tearing off
          "MARCH" to begin "APRIL".
                         
          WIDEN TO REVEAL CLARA, the middle-aged housekeeper and offseason
          caretaker for the house. With her overcoat and purse on one arm, she
          drops the "MARCH" calendar page in a wastebasket, then crosses to the
          pantry where a door and wooden steps lead down to the basement.CLARA(CALLING)The rooms are all in order, double- and triple-checked, and I'm on my
          way...
                         
          She hears a CLATTER from down below.INT. BASEMENT - DAYMUFFY ST. JOHN drags a woman's body across the floor. The arm comes
          off in her hand.MUFFYShit.CLARA'S VOICENeed any help down there?
                         
          Clara comes clopping down the steps. Muffy turns, the mannequin's arm
          still in her hand. Old workclothes and a head kerchief take the place
          of Muffy's normally impeccable prep Seven Sisters outfit (including
          the regulation penny loafers) in all this dust. Early 20's, pretty in
          an off-beat sort of way, Muffy is every inch a blue-blood.MUFFY(puffing with the effort)
          No, Clara, thanks. Just trying some last minute straightening down
          here... god, I don't think I've ever worked so hard in my life...!CLARASure you don't want me to stay? There's nobody gonna be around
          here to help till first ferry back Monday, y'know...MUFFY(continuing with her work)
          Nope, you're a peach, Clara. But this one's mine. I told my father I'd
          do it, and I will. My way. I don't want him to have any excuses.CLARA(dubiously , turning to go)
          All right, then. Have a nice party.MUFFY(a buoyant laugh)
          Nice? It has to be better than nice... it's gotta be bloody
          unforgettable!
                         
          Clara climbs the stairs.CLARAGood luck.MUFFY (CONT)Bye, Clara. See you Monday.
                         
          Soon there's the upstairs SOUND of the kitchen door closing behind
          Clara.
          Muffy finally props the mannequin, clearing away the remaining
          clutter. She goes to open a basement window for ventilation. It is a
          ground-level transom, hinged at the top. Through it Clara is visible
          departing the grounds.
                         
          Then Muffy hears a DRIPPING. She turns, hesitating, and follows the
          sounds.INT. UTILITY ROOMPart of the basement, an old washroom and more, with tub, slop sink
          and large incinerator. Muffy enters, pulling the chain on the bare,
          overhead bulb. It illuminates the room, and the tub underneath --
          slightly rusty at the drain, but otherwise spotless -- and the slowly
          dripping faucet.EXT. FERRY LANDING - MAINLAND - DAYCHAZ, the videocameraman and the only member of the group we haven't
          seen till now, is the first to spot the ferry approaching.CHAZHere she comes...
                         
          He's a real hi-tech freak and Ivy League wiseass, a free spirit in
          neo-punk neck curl and button-down shirt. He shoulders his lightweight
          videopak again, taping it. Arch and Skip watch with him from the end
          of the pier. But Kit and Nikki, waiting nearer the office, are
          distracted by the SOUND of an arriving car.ANGLE - PARKING LOTIt's not Rob, though. It's NAN, another newcomer. She pulls her car
          next to the others in the gravel lot behind the landing office and -
          gets out quickly, dragging a hefty suitcase out of the back seat. She
          is an unfamiliar face to Kit and Nikki --a shy, earnest, small-town
          girl, overdressed for the occasion.NAN(HURRIED)Hi... is this the ferry to the St. John house?NIKKI IAny second now.NANOh, thank goodness ! I didn't know if I was on the right road...
                         
          Kit smiles welcome, lending a hand as Nan struggles the bag up the
          ramp.KITHi. Kit Graham... Nikki Brashears.NANNan Youngblood.NIKKI(needling, about the suitcase)
          Planning on staying a while?NAN(flushes, embarrassed)
          Oh, no... just some work for finals, when we get back... you don't
          know how far behind I am...
                         
          Arch outhustles Chaz for her bag. Her simple attractiveness exerts an
          appeal.ARCHHi. Arch Cummings . I've seen you around. Jewett Hall, right?CHAZChaz Vyshinsky. You got great legs.NIKKI(pointed1y, reminds him)
          Chaz, Arch already has her bag.
                         
          Meaning, Chaz is Nikki's man, especially for this weekend.NAN(volunteering, happily)
          Well, I only met Muffy this term in Drama Society . I volunteered to
          do their costumes... I like to sew... Did you see her in Ghosts? She's
          so talented. She was wonderful!SKIP(to Nan, approvingly; in greeting)
          Congratulations, on finding your way.
                         
          The landing BUMPS, the ferry touches down. They look up.ANGLE CHANGEFERRYMAN(BARKS)Stand clear!
                         
          The large, raw-boned FERRYMAN holds open the wooden stile for the one
          and only passenger from the island � Clara -- to disembark. Clara
          passes them , giving first Skip and then the others a look, shaking
          her head in sad appraisal.
          FERRYMAN (cont.)(GROWLS)Ok, let's go.
                         
          It's not the friendliest greeting in the world. The ferryman keeps the
          stile open for them to board singly. There is also a younger assistant
          on board -- BUCK, a pleasant, openfaced townie in his 20s.
                         
          FERRYMAN (cont.)
          To the rear. Outa the operator's way.
                         
          Nikki clutches at Skip's arm.NIKKI(IN MOCK-TERROR)This is it? No going back? Trapped for days on an island where
          men are men, and women oughta know better?ARCH(BEHIND HER)Try to control yourself, Sister O'Toole.NIKKI(SUGGESTIVE )You could tie me in chains...
                         
          Chaz boards, passing Buck, the assistant.CHAZ(a low whisper)
          Your fly's open, and your Hostess Twinkie's hanging out...
                         
          The assistant gapes, falling for it, groping his fly. Which is closed,
          of course. He looks up, grinning. Chaz kisses him on the cheek, winks
          and moves on.BUCKSh -i-i-t...
                         
          Kit is hanging back on the dock.FERRYMANCome on if you're coming.KIT(URGENTLY)Excuse me. But we're still waiting for somebody --FERRYMAN(GRUFFLY)It's Friday. My last run of the week. I don't get paid overtime.KITBut you've got to wait. They said it's the only way over.
          If he misses this...
                         
          Arch WHISTLES loudly, seeing and alerting them.PARKING LOT - THEIR POVA late model Detroit sedan (the one we saw earlier turning off the
          highway) pulls to a fast stop in the lot. Rob hurries out; a CHEER
          comes up from the group on the ferry. Kit closes her eyes in relief.
          Rob comes hurrying up the ramp.ANGLE � LANDING...followed closely by HARVEY 'HAL' EDISON, JR.HARVEYWait up!
                         
          Harvey is the driver of the sedan, and after he carefully locks up, he
          comes running with his bag, too. He is a rangy, straight-arrow Ivy
          League farmboy from the Border South, and he's the last of Muffy's
          invited guests. He also, somewhat incongruously, sports a Bruce
          Springsteen badge.ROB(to Kit, kissing her)
          Sorry... Nik, Chaz...
          (to Skip and Nan whom he doesn't know)

          They return greetings.HARVEY(RIGHT BEHIND )Hi! Harvey 'Hal' Edison, Jr., but please call me Hal. Only my folks
          call me Harve... and I can't stand it. Boy, this sure is a pretty
          spot.
                         
          Stylistically, he's a Martian. Chaz stares at him.CHAZYou're friends with... Muffy St. John?HARVEY(PROUDLY)Sure am. We sit together in Econ 345. I let her copy my marginal
          utility curves.NIKKII get it. That's a joke.
          Preppy Skip adds his greeting.SKIP(an ironical nod)

          He slams the stile down after Harvey, the last to board, and gets busy
          with the stubborn motor. His assistant helps. Chaz tapes.HARVEY(enthusiastically, putting down his fear)
          YOU all buddies?NIKKIExcept for Skip and Nan. Them we just met.KIT(AMIABLY)But we will be.CHAZ(MEANING SKIP)Watch what you say around him, though. He's Muffy's cousin.HARVEY(tickled, to Skip)
          No kiddin'?SKIPDistant. Over the horizon.
          Otherwise, I wouldn't be invited...

          Old money never mixes family with friends.NIKKIThis is true. For as long as I've known her.KIT(JOKING)To protect her family, I guess.SKIP(UNSMILING)To keep her friends.
                         
          He turns to Arch, holds up his hand, and CLICK, a switchblade opens
          into the lens.
                         
          SKIP (cont.)
          Choose your weapons, big guy.ARCH(nervously, a laugh)

          Your fly's open.(SHRUGS)Ok, so don't believe me.
                         
          He keeps the tape rolling. Rob discreetly looks down. His fly is
          open. Kit looks at him dubiously. Rob zips. Chaz beams, getting it all
          for posterity. The engine finally engages. The ferry lurches.ROB(smiles weakly to Kit)
          We're off!
                         
          They are indeed.EXT. THE SOUND - DISTANT POV - DAYThe ferry pulls away from the mainland.EXT. THE FERRY - DAYA CLOSER ANGLE. The sturdy, barge like ship craft makes progress. The

          Rob steps forward and lifts the painting off the wall. Behind it is an
          inset bookcase. Sitting on one of the shelves, at the proper height to
          have lined up with the holes in the portrait, is a child's Felix-the-

          his side.

          Something MOVES nearby. He doesn't pay attention, taking out his knife
          to cull the dried leaves. He cups them in his hand against the wind,

          Skip flips a lightswitch in the darkness and nothing happens. He edges
          slowly along a wall away from the door. Then he becomes aware of

          sound--completely inhuman.SKIPHello?

          Kit is nearest to him, and without warning, he lunges at her and
          buries a knife into her stomach �up to the handle.
                         
          Kit screams and chokes, trying to fight him off: but he stabs her
          again, and again and again, plunging the knife deep into her with
          every thrust.KITMuffy! Stop him! Help! He's killing me! Oh, God! He's killing me!
                         
          Muffy, initially paralyzed with fear, now runs for her life, down the
          hallway, down the stairs...INT. ENTRY HALL - SAME...and to the front door as Kit's screams O.S. fade to silence. Muffy
          yanks on the door handle, but the door will not open. She pulls again
          and again desperately, but it won't budge,
          She turns and runs out of the entry hall. Just as she CLEARS FRAME,
          the front door swings silently open...INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAMEMuffy is racing past the back stairs toward the kitchen when A HAND
          reaches out from the pantry and hooks her around the face.
                         
          She is pulled backward, screaming, through the swinging door into the
          darkened pantry.INT. PANTRY � SAMEIt is Skip!
                         
          He pulls her head back, exposing her throat. He raises a knife to it,
          still stained with Kit's blood.SKIP(RAVING)It's all over, Muffy! Everything'll be mine!MUFFYSkip! No! ! !
                         
          He makes a move to slit her throat, when Muffy kicks open
          the swinging door and sees...HER POV...standing on the other side, smiling, in various states of fake
          blood and mess... Rob, Kit, Nikki, Chaz and Nan. Muffy's eyes pop out.
          Skip's hands relax. And the others burst out laughing.FADE OUTFADE INEXT. THE HOUSE � DAYCLOSE UPA SIGN being lifted into the air. It reads:APRIL BAY LODGEJust Another Country Inn
