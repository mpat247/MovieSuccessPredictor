     high school...1A   ANOTHER CORRIDOR                                                1A...we hear all the sounds of a STANDARD PORNO FLICK, from the
     unenthusiastic screams of fake ecstasy to the cheesy music.1B   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY                1BThe sounds echo in the empty hall. Behind the stage a light
     from an open door...MATT (O.S.)This is unwatchable. It's not even in
                focus. And geez, look, the boom mike is
                in the shot. This is really shoddy work.1C   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - A/V ROOM   - DAY                1CThe door leads into this room, as we continue on to a
     TV MONITOR displaying a sweaty guy's ugly face.DEACON (O.S.)Why do they always show the guy's face?
                It's like, can't we just assume he's
                enjoying it?
     We slowly PULL BACK from the TV.FRED (O.S.)Because they're trying to make us feel
                like we're better looking than that guy,
                so we should be able to get chicks as hot
                as her.DEACON (O.S.)How the hell do you know?FRED (O.S.)It's a basic rule of porno.
     Finally, we REVEAL our three heroes: MATT, FRED, and DEACON.
     They're watching the porno...2    INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - A/V ROOM - DAY                   2... before school with the sound turned way down, but you can
     still hear the porno. The three guys are sitting with their
     book bags on their laps to conceal any possible bonerage.FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                        2.DEACON (V.O.)It all started on my seventeenth birthday
              with our usual morning routine: film
              appreciation.
    The school bell RINGS and Deacon clicks off the TV.FREDDeacon! What are you doing? I was
              watching that.DEACONCome on, let's go. We're going to be
              late.DEACON (V.O.) (CONT'D)And when I say film appreciation, I mean
              film duplication. Fred steals them, Matt
              copies them, and I sell them.
    Matt walks over to the TV and presses eject on five VCR's.
    The original plus four copies pop out.
    CLOSE ON the original tape: "Ramalot Productions presents
    Dirty Darla #7," as Matt hands it to Fred and the copies to
    Deacon. They smile.3   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY                   3The guys are waiting in line for lunch.DEACON (V.O.)Fred's the kind of kid who's basically
              given up on high school. He figures his
              glory days are way ahead of him.FREDFirst, I go to Yale, then Harvard law,
              then when I'm making a hundred grand a
              year, I'll have a whole stable of hot
              chicks sitting around topless on my
              yacht.
    He smiles ears to ear, looking for approval.MATT(to Deacon)
              Will that work?DEACON(to Fred)
              You are a complete moron.
    Deacon and Matt walk off. Fred calls after them.FREDWhat?FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                        3.4   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                     4The video monitors up and down the hallways display an image
    that reads "Fifteen Days Till Midterms."
    Fred sees two AMAZING GIRLS walking towards him.DEACON (V.O.)Until that big payday, Fred's sex life
              consists of spanking it.AMAZING GIRLThat test was sooo hard.
    That's too much for Fred to take. He adjusts his pants, turns
    ninety degrees, and makes a beeline for:5   INT. BOYS' BATHROOM - DAY                                         5Fred looks under the stalls to make sure no one's in there,
    then enters a stall and locks the door.
    He puts his book bag down, then places a protector on the
    toilet seat and sits down. He pulls a large wad of toilet
    paper off the roll. Then, from out of the book bag, Fred
    pulls a bottle of Moisty-Mate hand lotion. He smiles.6   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                     6Fred is walking to class when he spots a HOT GIRL, rubbing a
    stain off of her shirt. Another HOT GIRL grabs her arm.HOT GIRLWe're going to be late. Are you coming?
    Fred perks up.7   INT. BOYS' BATHROOM - DAY                                         7Fred walks into the stall and grabs the toilet protector.DEACON (V.O.)Fred averages two to five time a day,
              depending on how many girls he sees in
              the hallway.8   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                     8Matt is videotaping the students (including J.T. and Mark)
    running down the hallway to class. Fred watches.DEACON (V.O.)Now Matt-- Matt's what you'd call a late
              bloomer. Secretary of the Audio Visual
              Club, amateur filmmaker, and complete
              dork.FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                        4.J.T. and Mark grab Matt's camera and film each other flipping
      him off. Matt grabs it back and the Twins walk away laughing.
      Fred shakes his head.FREDWhat are you doing?MATTAll great directors start this way. I'm
                   documenting the essence of high school.
                   Teenagers running to meet their destiny
                   only to find it's just home room. It's
                   very existential.FREDSo's my balls. See you later.9     OMITTED                                                             910    INT. OUTSIDE THE LOCKER ROOMS - DAY                                10Matt trudges into the locker room area, holding a towel to
      his bloody nose.DEACON (V.O.)In the normal course of things, Matt
                   probably wouldn't even have been our
                   friend, but Fred likes having someone to
                   boss around, and I think Matt's actually
                   pretty cool once you get to know him.
      Just then, the burly GIRLS' SWIM TEAM COACH comes out of the
      girls' locker room. She walks by Matt without noticing, and
      the door to the locker room closes slowly.
      Matt's attention is drawn to it. The door stops with a CREAK,
      a sliver of daylight still visible.
      Matt shakes his head and starts to walk away towards the
      boys' locker room. Then, he stops. He's torn. He's still too
      immature to really be interested, but he thinks he should be.
      He looks around quickly, then slowly approaches the door. He
      turns his head sideways, and places it up against the crack.10A   MATT'S POV                                                        10AThe proverbial jackpot. Teenage girls changing. Bras.
      Panties. Towels...10B   REVERSE ANGLE                                                     10BMatt's eyes widen. And then, they CLOSE TIGHT. He quickly
      scurries away.DEACON (CONT'D; V.O.)Well, at least he's got the key to the
                   A/V room.FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                     5.11   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                   11Deacon talks quietly to a DORKY FRESHMAN.DEACONDirty Darla #7 is a modern classic. This
               is grade-A porn, my friend. Worth a lot
               more than twenty dollars.DORKY FRESHMANSweet.
     He hands him the money and Deacon makes the exchange for the
     tape. The freshman clutches it like gold and scurries away.
     Deacon heads out down the hallway towards his locker. He sees
     a gaggle of teenage GIRLS gossiping.DEACON (V.O.)People always talk about how tough it is
               being a teenage girl. I mean, if I have
               to watch one more TV movie about bulimia
               or self mutilation or vaginal dryness...
     Deacon reaches his locker and opens it. He sees some
     CHEERLEADERS bouncing down the hallway. Deacon takes out some
     books for class.DEACON (CONT'D; V.O.) (CONT'D)I'll tell you what's really hard. Being a
               seventeen year old boy. Imagine what it's
               like to have only one thing on your mind
               all day, every day, but to have
               absolutely no way of getting it.12   INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY                                        12CLOSE ON a textbook showing the anatomy of the vagina.
     PULL BACK to reveal Deacon, seemingly staring into space, but
     really staring at...DEACON (V.O.)Testosterone is a drug more powerful than
               heroin. I don't really have any evidence
               to support that, but the point is, a
               horny teenage boy will do almost anything
               for even a glimpse of sex.
     ... his BIOLOGY TEACHER's erect NIPPLES visible through her
     conservative bra and blouse. Aside from her flashing
     headlights, she's the kind of woman you wouldn't notice even
     if you were alone with her on a two-man luge. But that
     doesn't matter-- Deacon can't take his eyes off of them.FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                     6.BIOLOGY TEACHER(in the background)
               ... the increase in the hormone
               testosterone causes certain physiological
               changes in the adolescent male...DEACON (V.O.)We're suffering. Suffering from a deep,
               debilitating addiction to something we've
               never even had. Teenage boys are like
               time bombs, ready to explode.BEHIND DEACONTwo GUYS are whispering.GUY 1Did you hear about Rachael?GUY 2No, what happened?GUY 1John Baldwin nailed her.
     Deacon bolts upright and spins around, concerned.DEACONAre you talking about Rachael Unger?GUY 1Yeah. It was at Richard Rosenblatt's
               party. In the bathroom.DEACON(crushed)
               You're kidding.13   INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK)                        13RACHAEL UNGER, Deacon's girlfriend at the time, is naked
     under Deacon's sheets after school one day. Deacon ENTERS
     from the bathroom and is immediately surprised by her state
     of undress.DEACONRachael! What are you doing?
     She sits up and strikes a sexy pose.RACHAELWe've been together for a year now, and I
               thought it was time to take our
               relationship to the next level.

               months.DEACONI didn't think you were listening to me.
     Suddenly, Rachael becomes a little self-conscious.RACHAELDon't you want to?DEACONOf course I do. But, I, um... I don't
               have anything...
     She pulls out a condom.RACHAELI do.
     But he's still hesitating.RACHAEL (CONT'D)Deacon, what's the problem?
     Deacon looks at her waiting there for him, his for the
     taking. An eternity passes. Then,DEACONI have a math test tomorrow.14   INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY (END FLASHBACK)                        14The Teacher CLEARS HER THROAT and Deacon snaps out of it. He
     turns away from the guys behind him as they continue to
     describe the John Baldwin incident.DEACON (V.O.)"I have a math test tomorrow." The bottom
               line is, I just couldn't do it. I don't
               know why, I just couldn't. And I've
               cursed myself every day since then.
     Deacon is suddenly...15   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                   15... very depressed as he trudges to his locker. Which is
     nothing compared to how he feels when he looksFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                     8.DOWN THE HALLWAYand sees Rachael at her locker, hugging some people good-bye
     (including a good-looking guy who must be JOHN BALDWIN).
     Rachael looks down the hallway towards Deacon, but Deacon
     ducks away.
     Now he's even more embittered.16   EXT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY              16Fred and Matt are walking towards their bikes after school.FREDDid you videotape it?MATT(sarcastically)
               Yeah. I took my camera to gym class with
               me.FREDYou are the biggest moron I have ever
               known.
     Just then, Deacon comes up to them.DEACONHey, guys. Here's the money.
     He hands out the proceeds from the operation, and Matt
     notices that Deacon is a little out of sorts.MATTSomething wrong?
     Deacon lets out a deep breath.DEACONYeah. I heard Rachael Unger did it with
               John Baldwin.FREDWell, you had your chance. I told you to
               seal that deal.DEACONShut up, Fabio. I don't see you sealing
               any deals.FREDI'm biding my time.DEACONWhatever. It just wasn't good timing.FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                       9.FREDIt doesn't get any better than that. You
          and Rachael were perfect for each other.
          And naked girls don't just appear out of
          thin air.

They reach the bike rack and start unlocking their bikes.DEACONSo we have a responsibility to ourselves
          to start having fun and getting girls.
          This year is our year.
              (takes the chain off his bike)
          There's nothing holding us back any more.
Over in the parking lot, JAKE, a studly senior, revs the
engine on his truck. Two hot girls, KELLY and WENDY, sit on
his bumper, chatting.DEACON (CONT'D)You see? That's exactly what I'm talking
          about. That could be us.FREDThat's not going to be us this year, or
          next year, or any year, ever.DEACONWhy not? All we have to do is follow the
          simple lessons of Tony Montana in "Scar
          Face."MATTOoh. Good movie.DEACON AND MATT(with Cuban accents)
          "First you get the money, then you get
          the power, then you get the women."FREDSo, we're going to become Cuban drug
          lords?FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                        10.DEACONListen, the porno pirating operation is
                 bringing in plenty of money. When I get
                 my new car tonight for my birthday, we'll
                 have the power to go wherever we want.
                 Then, there's nothing stopping us from
                 getting the girls.
     Fred and Matt look at Deacon warily. Is this a plan? Then,
     the hot girls and Jake drive past the guys.JAKEBye, Sphincter!
     They laugh, then peel out with the radio blasting.FREDNothing's going to change, Deacon. You're
                 still going to be the kid who shit his
                 pants in fifth grade and no one will ever
                 let you forget it.DEACONI had a stomach virus, asshole.
     Just then, a super hot CHEERLEADER drops her car keys and
     bends over to pick them up.FREDOh, that's just not fair.
     Fred adjusts himself.17   OMITTED                                                            1718   INT. VIDEO CASA DEL RUSS A.K.A. RUSS'S VIDEO MAGIC - DAY           18Fred arrives dressed for work (name tag, shirt, etc.) and

     CUSTOMERS on his way to the back section of the store.ADULT SECTIONFred makes sure Russ isn't looking and ducks into the porno
     section. Hurriedly, he pulls out "Half-Cyborg 5: Final
     Showdown" from his book bag. But inside the case is the tape
     for "Dirty Darla #7." He makes the switch. Fred sighs a
     breath of relief, smiles, and walks out of the adult

the shelf, shaking him with every word.RUSS (CONT'D)Those movies aren't for little monkey-

The Customers stop to stare at the scene. Fred breaks free,
and Russ chases after him.RUSSCome back here, you bastard!
Russ runs after him and DIVES at Fred's legs, knocking him
and entire shelf of tapes over. The tape FLY EVERYWHERE. Fred
is still SCREAMING.
Russ starts shouting at Fred so that everyone can hear. A
crowd gathers around to watch the spectacle.RUSS (CONT'D)What else you got in here?
Russ rips open Fred's bag and pulls out items, looking for
more tapes. Fred tries to stop him, but the old man has an
iron grip and keeps him away.
Fred cringes as Russ exposes porno magazines, kleenex
tissues, baby wipes, the bottle of Moisty-Mate Firming

     people in the pool, including   Jake's good-looking friends,
     Kelly, Wendy, J.T., and MARK.   It's hard to tell in the dark
     water, but it looks like they   might not be wearing any
     clothes. Deacon sees this and   starts to walk away.J.T.Deacon. I heard it was your birthday.

shorts. He gets into the pool in his underwear, then slips
them off, too, and throws them on the side of pool.DEACONWow. This feels amazing.
Someone splashes Kelly, she giggles, and the other kids swim
around. Kelly swims by Deacon seductively and he smiles.JAKE (O.S.)Coop's doing funnels. Come on.

And he does. The backyard lights go on illuminating the
scene. Deacon panics. People start looking at him, laughing.
Then, the cheesy colored pool lights come on, flashing
slowly.
Deacon is humiliated. Jake bends down to whisper to Deacon.JAKE (CONT'D)Did you really think Naomi was into you?
Deacon doesn't respond. But it's not enough for Jake. He
picks up Deacon's underwear with a stick and examines them.JAKE (CONT'D)Oh my God! Skid marks. Aaaahhh, Deacon

      Finally, the lights turn off in the back yard, and Deacon
      ventures out of the pool.
      He grabs an inflatable elephant pool toy and slips it around

      Deacon FREEZES. He desperately tries to cover himself with
      the rapidly diminishing toy being jerked away by the dog in a
      motion that makes it look like Deacon's getting a doggie

laughing with him, not at him, and Deacon can tell the
difference. He relaxes...JAKE (O.S.)Hey, sphincter.

               compensating for his little dick that
               never even gets hard.
     Deacon chokes on his drink.DEACONWell at least you were smart enough to
               dump him. I mean, you deserve someone who
               will treat you ... I don't know. Really
               well.NAOMIYou know what you are?
     Deacon gets a little nervous.NAOMI (CONT'D)You're a nice guy.

     himself to make a decision. He kisses her!

     Most guys would look away at this point, with a fabulous babe
     with pouty lips staring you down. But Deacon passes the test:
     he stands his ground and kisses her again. She likes it.
     AT A WINDOW, Jake sees them kissing. He doesn't like it.
     AT ANOTHER WINDOW, Fred sees it, too. And for a completely
     different reason, he doesn't like it either.68   INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY                                            68The set is finally ready: Ashley is lying on the bed in a

     adjusting the video camera. The only thing missing is an

               don't you just go in there?
     Deacon balks at first, then looks over at Ashley, lying
     there.MATT (CONT'D)Come on...DEACONOkay. Okay. All right already.
     He pulls off his shirt and approaches Ashley with a pizza box
     from out of nowhere.MATTAnd action!FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                     64.Matt starts filming while Ashley pulls Deacon near her.ASHLEY (O.S.)Maybe I can pay for the pizza some other
          way...
We hear Deacon's ZIPPER opening offscreen as Deacon rolls his
eyes and reluctantly delivers his line:DEACONAnd maybe I could throw in the sausage
          for free.
Deacon shows no enthusiasm for what's happening down below.MATTFred, you get in there, too.FREDAre you sure?MATTYeah, it'll be a great shot.
Fred takes off his shorts and walks over to the other side of
the bed. Ashley is offscreen, presumably lying on the bed.
The two guys are facing each other.FREDHey.DEACONS'up?FREDHow's it going?
Deacon shrugs.FRED (CONT'D)Hey, did you see that show on Sci Fi
          about sun spots?DEACONYeah. They said there's going to be a

     Fred goes in to kiss Deacon, who's thoroughly confused.
     Deacon holds him back with his hand.DEACONWait. Why do you want us to kiss?MATT (O.S.)Because that's what guys do in gay porn.DEACONWhat?
     Deacon looks over at the camera. It's Ashley filming. PANIC!
     He slowly looks down at the person he and Fred are having sex
     with. He can barely look. It's Matt!MATTMore sausage please.DEACONAaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!CUT TO:69   INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                   69Deacon bolts up out of bed.

watt light. Deacon is still a little agitated.DEACONWhere the hell is Coop? There's no way
          I'm making out with Fred.

at Deacon.COOPWhat's going on?ASHLEYDeacon is talking about making out with
          Fred.FREDNo way. I'm holding the mike and that's

          sex with you. But it was just a dream so
          let's forget it.
Everyone is a little uneasy at this admission. Deacon quickly
changes the subject.DEACON (CONT'D)What's with the light?MATTIt's a "special effect." If you want this
          film to look amateurish, you're going to

with Deacon's conscience.DEACON (CONT'D)Do you ever think maybe we've gotten
          ourselves in a little over our heads with
          all of this?COOP (O.S.)Oh, baby. Not yet.
Fred appears to be pondering the question deeply. His face
slowly contorts to a look of seeming anguish. Then,FREDFire!

     much. He goes after Ashley, with his pants still around his
     ankles and his bare ass in full display.
