backgrounds, then:CUT TO:INT. WAREHOUSE - EARLY MORNINGCAMERA (STEADICAM) holds on a man in a suit, sitting behind
a desk, on the phone: BARRY EGAN (Adam Sandler)BARRY...yes I'm still on hold...OPERATORAnd what was this?BARRYI'm looking at your advertisement
            for the airline promotion and
            giveaway?OPERATORThis is "Fly With Us?"BARRYIt's hard to understand because it
            says in addition to but I can't
            exactly understand in addition to
            what because there's actually
            nothing to add it too...OPERATORI think that's a type-o then, that
            would be a mistake.BARRYSo, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten
            purchases of any of your Healthy
            Choice products equals five hundred
            miles and then with the coupon the
            same purchases would value one
            thousand miles --OPERATORThat's it.BARRYDo you realize that the monetary
            value of this promotion and the
            prize is potentially worth more
            than the purchases?OPERATORI don't know...I mean: I don't know.OC DISTANT SOUND OF A CAR SKIDDING TO A STOP, SOME VAGUE,DISTANT SCREAMING IS HEARD...THEN SILENCE. Barry hears this,
gets distracted, then back to the phone call;BARRYCan I call you back if I have any
            further questions...? Can I get
            your extension?OPERATORIt's extension 215 if you want to
            try me back.BARRYOk. Thank you.

He hangs up the phone and walks through his warehouse. It's
fairly non-descript place, boxing materials, etc. Products
seem to be mainly silly novelties (pens that light up, key
chains, novelty toilet plungers, etc)

He lifts a LOADING DOOR and LIGHT POURS INSIDE, WASHES OUT
THE FRAME....he's silhouette....CAMERA follows him
out...stays overexposed and over his shoulder as he looks
down towards the street.....

...his business is situated at the end of a common driveway,
shared with a few other nondescript places and an Auto
mechanic....distant SOUND of a car SPEEDING and SKIDDING....

....hold, then:

....a JEEP CHEROKEE comes FLIPPING into FRAME, far off at
the mouth of the alley, on the street. The JEEP ends up
landing RIGHT SIDE UP....HOLD....

.....Barry flinches a little, stares.....the JEEP sits idle
for a moment....then it drives off....then:

A speeding, small TOYOTA comes into view at the mouth of the
alley, screeching to a halt. The passenger side door opens
and a small, wooden HARMONIUM (like a portable organ) is
placed on the ground. The TOYOTA speeds away.....

....a moment or two later another NON-DESCRIPT CAR flies
past very fast....

BEAT. Barry squints, looks at the small HARMONIUM sitting
alone in the middle of the street.

He hesitates, looks around, holds, then walks back inside
his warehouse.CUT TO:INT. BARRY'S WAREHOUSE - THAT MOMENTBarry on the phone again;BARRY....I'm not exactly sure what that
            means...VOICEIf they break or something. What is
            it, plastic?BARRYIt's a plastic, yeah.VOICERight. Alright, lemme call you
            first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run
            the numbers, see what's what and
            I'll give you a call back --BARRYDid you have my home phone number?VOICEFor what?BARRYIf you wanted to call me back I
            could...VOICEI'm fine, I have your work number.BARRYOk...because of the time difference
            if you needed to call me early?VOICEIt's fine. I can just get you at
            your office.BARRYOk.VOICEOk, bye, bye.BARRYBye.

He hangs up the phone and walks outside, CAMERA follows him
again, out to the alley, over his shoulder......he looks
down the length of the alley at the Harmonium. HOLD, THEN:

A small FORD ESCORT pulls into the driveway, around the
Harmonium, parks......a young woman named LENA LEONARD
(Emily Watson) exits the car and starts to walk down the
length of the alley towards him.....CAMERA stays over his
shoulder and turns into a profile 2-shot;LENAHi. Do you work at the mechanic?BARRYNo.LENAThey're not open yet?BARRYThey don't get opened until eight.

BEAT. Barry gently steps back and out of the FRAME.LENAIs it ok if I leave my car you think?BARRYI don't know.LENAI thought they opened at seven.
                   (beat)
            If I left my car would it be ok?BARRYI don't know.LENADo you know them.BARRYNot very well.LENACan I ask you, can I trust to leave
            my keys with you and give them to
            you so that when they get here you
            could give them to them?BARRYOk.LENAYou think it's ok where I left it,
            right there?BARRYI think that'll be fine.

Lena hands him her keys, he steps back into FRAME, THEN:LENAThere's a piano in the street.BARRYYeah.BEAT.LENAOk. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank
            you for your help.BARRYThank you.LENAMaybe I'll see you later, when I
            pick up my car?BARRYOk.

She walks away....he starts back inside the warehouse,
hesitates, watches her go.....right before she reaches the
end of the alley, she glances back quickly, over her
shoulder....he dodges inside real quick.....

HOLD THE EMPTY FRAME......then he steps back out.....looks
off at the Harmonium.....and the empty street.....he looks
around some more....then he makes the long walk down the
street.ON THE STREET.Barry stares at the Harmonium a little bit, looks around,
both ways, then casually picks it up and walks back towards
his business.....

He brings it into his office and places it on his desk. He
tries a few keys....pressing down...there's no sound.

He presses his hand on the foot pedal and presses a key and
a small note is made.....BEAT....he does it again....and
holds the note.....CUT TO BLACK.INT. WAREHOUSE - OFFICE - EARLY MORNINGBarry enters the warehouse with harmonium and runs into his
office. He places it on the desk and hits a key: no sound.

Barry goes to his knees and unlatched the bellows. He pumps
the bellow, reaches up, presses a note, and another...then
stands up into CU. and presses the 5 note
melody......SUDDENLY: THE SOUND OF THE POD BAY DOOR SLIDING....

....Barry spins around, scared shitless, sees: LANCE, who
enters the warehouse, Barry rushes out to greet him;LANCEHey, good morning, Barry.BARRYHey...Lance....can I.....LANCEYou ok?BARRYYes I'm fine.LANCEWhy you wearin' a suit?BARRYUm....I bought one. I thought maybe
            it would be nice to get dressed for
            work, can I show you something?LANCEYeah.....you got here early huh?BARRY....yes.....

They enter into the office, Lance sees the harmonium;LANCEWhat is this?BARRYI don't know. I think it's a
            piano....a small piano.LANCEThat's not a piano.....I have a
            piano at home.....where'd you get it?

Lance walks around behind the harmonium....leaving Barry
alone....towards the warehouse......he starts to back up a
little.....BARRYWell.....it was dropped on the
            street.....

Sal, Ernesto and Rico all start to come into work behind
Barry.....he sees them: CAMERA pushes in on Barry....LANCE (OC)Why is it here? Barry....Barry?BARRY...it just....I don't know....I
            don't know.LAND IN CU. ON BARRY. CUT TO BLACK.TITLE CARD Punch-drunk Love Movie

(maybe color blooms/overture here)INT. WAREHOUSE/MAIN AREA - DAYCAMERA pushes in slow as Barry and Lance talk to TWO
CUSTOMERS about the plungers which are on display in front
of them. They speak all over each other doing shop talk, etc;CUSTOMERYou do guaranteed sale? etc.BARRYWe back our plungers 100% and we do
            ask for a 30 to 60 day display on
            the floor.....

In the b.g., RICO over the laud speaker says:RICOBarry, your sister's on line one.

Barry doesn't move....BARRYYes.....we do ask for....30 to 60
            days....CUSTOMERI think you have a call?

Rico turns around, without loudspeaker;RICOBarry, your sister is on line one.

They look at him a moment....BARRYI'm just gonna grab this call real
            quick?

ANGLE, REVERSE. Barry turns and heads for the phone nearby
at Rico's station;BARRY(into phone)
            .....This is Barry.RHONDAHey it's me, it's Rhonda. Are you
            coming to the party tonight?BARRYHi, Rhonda, yes I am.RHONDABye.

She hangs up.BARRYOk. Yes I'll see you tonight.

Barry takes a few steps back to the Customers:BARRYSorry about that: One thing I
            wanted to point out, Dave, is that
            we've just received a large order
            from the Rio Hotel and Casino in
            Las Vegas where we're going to be
            supplying their hotel rooms with
            the dice and money plunger, so
            these babies are really moving well
            right now...RICO(over loudspeaker)
            Barry, your sister's on line two.
            Barry, your sister's on line two.

Barry tries again to ignore it....BARRYWith the Aqua Blast Whales and
            Speed Boats we're gonna ask for a
            display at eye level for the little
            kids.....RICOBarry --BARRY-- excuse me.

Barry walks back to the phone;BARRYThis is Barry.KARENHey it's me, what are you doing?BARRYHello, Karen. I'm just working.KARENYeah but what are you doing?BARRYI'm just working....I have some
            customers here.....KARENSo you can't talk to me?BARRYI have a few people here, I can't
            really chat right now.KAREN"chat?" Did you just say "chat?"BARRYWell, I can't talk though --KARENYou just fucking said "chat," that
            is so -- what are you now? "chat."

            your precious customers.BARRYOk, bye-bye.

Barry snaps out of this, turns, claps his hands in confidence
and walks back to the customers and says:BARRYSorry about that.CUSTOMERI didn't know you had a sister?BARRY.....Well yes I do....
                   (beat)
            But one more thing I wanted to tell
            you guys about the new plungers is
            that we're making the handles now
            in a non-breakable material

He takes one of the plungers and to demonstrate smacks it on
the table....it SMASHES and rice falls out everywhere....BARRYOk...this is one of the old ones, I
            think. Lance do we have any new
            plungers around?

Lance moves to get a new plunger....BARRYThat was a little embarrassing and
            that was one of the old handles so
            let me get a new one to show you --RICO(loudspeaker)

Barry hangs up the phone real fast. HOLD. He doesn't move.CUT TO:INT. BARRY'S WORK/WAREHOUSE - MORNING/LATERCAMERA (HAND HELD) behind Barry, as he walks through the

taking his cue from Barry, is a bit more dressed up today....LANCEGood morning, Barry....BARRYHi, Lance.LANCEWhat's with all this pudding, what
            is this?

CAMERA sees that all the pudding Barry bought has been
stacked neatly in a corner. Barry stops dead in his tracks
to explain;BARRYThat's part of a very interesting
            airline promotion giveaway that's
            really tremendous. I'm going to
            start a collection of pudding and

quarter of some sort of melody starts here...)ANGLE, MOMENTS LATER.Barry is cutting up his CREDIT CARD with some scissors. He
throws it away.ANGLE, MOMENTS LATER.Barry paces around a little bit.....CAMERA stays inside and
watches him as he walks outside for a moment, looks
around....he sees something outside, hesitates, then dodges
back inside the warehouse --

-- once inside, he takes a horrendous, hurtful fall over
something....He stands up quick;BARRYThis is not supposed to be here.
            Seriously. Carlos, Carlos, this is
            really not supposed to be here. I
            don't mean to be a dick; but that's

smiles, looks ahead, CAMERA slowly pans a 180 around to
become her POV.

            guys that works here. That
            pudding's not mine.

BEAT. In the b.g., two WORKERS are dealing with getting a
large crate on top of a large stack of crates, they're using
a fork lift....in an instant the large CRATE tumbles to the
ground and SMASHES....Barry attempts to not notice this;LENAOh My God.BARRYIt's ok. That's ok. How long have
            you worked with Elizabeth?

The workers start calling out and apologizing for this to
Barry, who keeps looking straight ahead to Lena;LENASix months, maybe five, five or six
            months...do you wanna check that?BARRY(to the guys)

            going there for business --LENA-- well, if you're gonna go --BARRY-- I'm probably not gonna go though.LENA-- oh that's too bad, it's so great
            over there and if you were there we
            could say hello to each other or
            something --BARRY-- yeah that would be great, if I
            was gonna go but I'm not exactly
            sure, I have so much goin on
            here -- A lot depends on this thing
            I might do here and if that happens
            I can't go and if it doesn't happen
            then I probably will, but I doubt it.

There's another LOUD CRASH as they try to reposition the box
that's fallen, giving way to something else that FALLS. In
other words, to correct the mistake they've already made,
they have to sacrifice another CRATE that CRASHES. She
looks, Barry just flinches, tries to stay looking straight
ahead; CAMERA (HAND HELD) with Elizabeth, comes walking back
in.....says to Barry:ELIZABETHI can't find that thing in my car,
            I can't find it so I'll just get it
            and give it to you later. So?LENA(to Elizabeth)

            have this crying problem or something?LENABye, Barry.BARRYGoodbye.ELIZABETHCall me later.

Lena and Elizabeth leave. CAMERA leads them as they walk;
Sound starts to drop out, we see Barry and the boys cleaning
up the boxes in the back....move into a CU on Lena....Music
Cue. Score. treated piano, small rhythm/melodic(notes of
harmonium so far)/gentle.ELIZABETHSo I'll meet you at the restaraunt?LENAOk.

Lena gets into her car. Elizabeth keeps walking. She waits
until Elizabeth is out of sight at the mouth of the driveway
and then she gets back out of her car and walks straight
back into the warehouse.CUT TO:INT. WAREHOUSE - THAT MOMENTShe comes walking in and over to Barry;LENAI'm going to go and eat tomorrow

They do a small search for a piece of paper, get it all
written down and sorted out and then -- as they do this
there is even more CRASHING AND SMASHING in the b.g., by the

THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE THE SCREEN travels (STEADICAM) with

                   (beat)
            I've been looking around a lot
            lately at promotional giveaways,
            cross promotional work by some
            companies. Do you remember all that
            pudding?LENAYeah.BARRYSo that pudding was bought, I
            bought that pudding because of a
            pretty interesting promotion that's
            sponsored by Healthy Choice and
            American Airlines. It's designed to
            encourage airline travel and
            obviously designed to encourage
            buying Healthy Choice products.
            They make frozen meals, deli meats,
            pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice
            creams, this sort of thing.....LENAYeah?BARRY....I'm sorry....I lost my
            thoughts, what I was saying....LENAYou were talking about the
            promotion --BARRY-- the promotion says: buy any 10
            Healthy Choice products and get 500
            miles of airline travel or 1,000
            for purchases made with a special
            coupon. So in the supermarket, you
            notice their products, first you
            notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken
            Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty
            good deal....but then I noticed
            they had soup at 89 cents a
            can.....and you start to do the
            math and you start to notice that
            it's a really amazing deal because
            I stumbled across the pudding at 25
            cents a cup. Now the crucial thing
            is the bar codes on the label.
            That's those little bar codes, you
            know? The universal product codes?LENAYeah.BARRYThat's what's used to redeem the
            mileage, so in noticing the
            pudding, each cup had an individual
            bar code -- in other words: Two
            dollars and fifty cents for ten
            cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add
            in the coupon: it's one thousand.
            You see?LENAYeah.BARRYYou see?LENAYeah, no, I see --BARRYYou see if you spent $3,000 dollars
            on pudding you could earn over one
            million frequent flyer miles.LENAThat's insane. That is really,
            really crazy. That's just crazy if
            you spend three thousand dollars on
            pudding.BARRY....yeah....LENASo that was your pudding?BARRY....No....LENAI'm sorry. I thought you said --BARRYNo I didn't say that.LENAI thought you said you bought all
            that pudding --BARRYMy friend Carlos is doing it who
            works with me. It's his. It's his
            pudding, he's doing it. It's not
            mine. He's crazy. I told him not to
            do it. He's the one who's insane.
            He only spent about one hundred
            dollars so far though --LENAYour sister was telling me a pretty
            funny story about you, when you
            guys were kids and you were
            building a ramp for your dog and
            you threw a hammer through a window?
            Is that right? You threw a hammer
            through a sliding glass door?

Barry starts to WELL WITH TEARS, which he hides very
quickly, holds a hand up to his face as if he's touching his
nose, and then he smiles;BARRYI don't remember that, she might be
