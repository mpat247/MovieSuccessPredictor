AFTER.LIFEWritten byAgnieska Wojtowicz-VoslooREVISED 10/07/08INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BEDROOM - DAYBLINDING WHITENESSWe hear a MAN GASPING softly.     Rhythmically.
          A LUMINOUS PALE SHAPE slowly forms out of the searing
          whiteness. Gradually we realize we're moving across the
          ALABASTER BODY of a WOMAN. Her skin translucent.ON THE WOMAN'S FACEEthereal.   Her eyes closed.     Her face lifeless.   Then...
          ...her eyes open. She looks straight at us with unseeing
          pale blue eyes. This is ANNA (late 20s).
          We pull back. PAUL (30s) makes love to Anna. Their
          movements perfunctory. Passionless. He turns to look at
          her. Realizes she's not there. He suddenly stops.
          Rolls off her. Sits on the edge of the bed.PAULWhat's wrong?ANNANothing.
          Anna leans down and picks up her RED SLIP from the floor.PAUL(SIGHS WEARILY)You used to enjoy it. Now it's...
          He shakes his head.    Frustrated.   Lights a cigarette.PAUL...it's like fucking a corpse.
          Paul immediately realizes he's gone too far.      Turns to Anna.PAULShit.   I'm sorry.   That was--
          Anna gets out of bed. Walks towards the bathroom.       Paul
          puts his head in his hands.INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATERThrough the fogged shower partition we see the blurred
          ghostly figure of Anna. Paul walks in.PAULAnna. I'm sorry. That was a stupid
                      thing to say.   But you know sometimes...
                      sometimes it's like you're not here
                      anymore. Like you're somewhere else.2.Anna doesn't reply.PAULIs this about us?ON ANNAher head bowed as she lets the water wash over her.ANNAIt's not about us.PAUL (O.C.)Then what is it?ANNAI don't know.PAUL (O.C.)I just want us to be happy.
          Anna doesn't move.    We sense the emptiness inside her.PAUL (O.C.)Are you happy?
          She closes her eyes.    Forces herself to reply.ANNAI'm happy.A DROP OF BLOODfalls into the water.   Then another drop.ON ANNAher nose is bleeding. She touches her lips. Looks
          impassively at the blood on her fingertips. The SOUND OF
          WATER carries into the next scene...FADE TO WHITE.A STREAM OF CRYSTAL BLUE WATERA MAN'S HANDS penetrate the water. Thin and elegant.
          Perfectly manicured. Turning slowly as he washes them
          meticulously. He picks up a crisply folded white towel.
          Dries his hands carefully. Snaps on white latex gloves.EXT. CEMETERY - MORNINGA beautiful morning. We move through a tranquil cemetery.
          Pastoral and idyllic. Dappled light falls through old
          trees onto statues of grieving angels.3.EXT. FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUSA path leads to an old well-kept house. Amongst a blaze of
          violet tulips we see a sign: Eliot Deane. Funeral Home.INT. FUNERAL HOME. CASKET DISPLAY ROOM - MORNINGSun streams into an elegant wood-panelled room. The

                    dies in their own way.INT/EXT. ANNA'S CAR - MORNINGAnna drives past the strip malls of a small suburban town
          in a GREEN TOYOTA. On the dashboard a KITSCHY BOBBLEHEAD
          DOLL nods its head from side to side. Anna pulls up to a
          red light. Glances across at the other cars. We see the
          vacant faces of COMMUTERS staring blankly into space.
          The light changes. Anna hasn't noticed. The car behind
          her HONKS in frustration. She quickly pulls out...
          ... just as a SUV turns in front of her. She slams on
          her brakes. Hard. Missing the SUV by inches. The
          DRIVER screams at her. His face contorted in ugly rage.EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. PARKING LOT - MORNINGAnna locks her car.   Heads towards the main building.INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. CORRIDOR - MORNINGClasses have started. JACK (11), a serious looking boy,
          walks through a silent corridor. Up ahead two OLDER
          BOYS, a TALL KID and a KID with ACNE, push a GEEKY BOY
          against a locker. Jack tries to pass by unnoticed.TALL KIDHey.   Jack-off!
          Jack walks faster. The two Older Boys set off after him.
          He darts into a corridor. Ducks into an empty classroom.INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. BIOLOGY CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATERJack waits anxiously by the door. It looks like he's
          lost the bullies. Then a sudden rustling noise makes him
          jump. He turns. TINY CHICKS huddle in a plastic
          incubator on a table. Jack moves over to them.TALL KID (O.C.)Didn't you hear me Jack-off?
          Jack swivels round. The Tall Kid walks towards him as
          the Acne Kid guards the door. Jack doesn't reply.ACNE KIDHe must be deaf.5.TALL KIDYou deaf Jack-off?
          Jack ignores them.   Irritating the Tall Kid even more.TALL KIDCan't fucking speak either.
          He pushes Jack against the table, toppling the incubator.
          Panicked, the CHICKS scatter across the surface. Just
          then the door opens. Anna walks in.ANNAWhat's going on?
          She glances at the Older Boys then at Jack.ANNAJack?JACKNothing Miss Bryant.ANNANothing? The incubator didn't just
                    fall by itself.
          The Older Boys stare at Jack.    Waiting for his reaction.JACKI tripped.   It was an accident.
          Anna looks at Jack carefully.    She knows he's lying.ANNA(to the Older Boys)
                    Show's over. Get to your classes.(TO JACK)Jack. Help me clear up.
          Jack doesn't hear her. He's mesmerized by a SOLITARY
          CHICK standing motionless in the corner of the incubator.JACKI think it's dead.
          Anna reaches in.   Tenderly picks up the chick.ANNANo.   The poor thing's just scared.INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. TEACHERS' COMMON ROOM - DAYSchool's over. Anna listlessly corrects a stack of
          exercise books. She can't focus. Pulls out a BOTTLE OF
          PILLS. Shakes a pill into her hand. Swallows it dry.6.INT. LAW OFFICE. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAYPaul works with half a dozen COLLEAGUES around a large
          conference table covered with documents and thick files.
          He reaches across to a pizza box. It's empty.PAULOK.   Who took the last pepperoni?
          A PREPPY GUY slides across another pizza box.PAULGreat.  Broccoli.
                           (lifts out a slice)
                    Who the fuck ordered broccoli?
          NEAL, a thin pallid guy, looks up.NEALOh that's just disgusting.PREPPY GUYWhat's wrong with vegetarian pizza?   It's
                    healthy.NEALPizza isn't supposed to be healthy.
          Paul glances at his watch. Suddenly realizes the time.
          He quickly picks up his cell phone. Heads for the door.NEALYou ordering in another pizza?PAULYeah.    With wheatgrass and alfalfa sprouts.
          Everyone laughs.PREPPY GUY(MUTTERS)Yeah. Yeah. Smart asses.INT. LAW OFFICE. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATERPaul walks into the corridor dialling his cell phone.INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. TEACHERS' COMMON ROOM - SAME TIMEAnna's cell phone rings as she closes her locker. She
          fishes it out from her bag as she heads to the door.
          Checks the ID. Hesitates. Then takes the call.7.INT. LAW OFFICE. CORRIDOR - SAME TIMEPaul cups his cell.    Worried he'll be overheard.PAULHi baby.    I'm really sorry about this

          Paul tries hard to cover his nervousness.   Forces a smile.PAULNothing. Don't worry. I just need... I
                    just want us to have dinner tonight.INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

Lowers his voice.PAULAnd Anna.    Everything's going to be fine.ANNA (O.S.)(FILTERED)Promise?PAULI promise.INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATERAnna slips her phone back into her bag as she walks
          through the deserted corridor. Her high heels echo
          loudly in the eerie quietness.
          Suddenly one of the fluorescent ceiling lights behind her
          blows out with a loud WHUMPH. Anna starts. Turns.
          WHUMPH. The next light dies. Anna quickens her step.
          The lights go off one by one. The darkness quickly
          creeping up behind her. There's only one light still on
          as she reaches the exit. She looks up. The light
          flickers. But then strangely stays on. Bathing her in a
          cold pool of light.
          Anna's unsettled. She turns and frantically pushes the
          door. It doesn't open. She pushes hard with both hands.
          Nothing. It's locked. She turns back slowly. The
          darkness around her impenetrable. Almost viscous. She
          reaches out...
          ... her hand DISAPPEARS into the thick blackness.     Anna
          snatches her hand back. Stares at it.
          Then we hear the sound of SLOW FOOTSTEPS.    Moving
          deliberately towards her.ANNA(NERVOUSLY)Hello?
          Her voice echoes down the silent corridor.   She glimpses
          something move in the blackness.ANNAIs someone there?9.A BLACK SHAPE materializes inside the darkness. Silent.
          Brooding. Anna can't move. Terrified. Suddenly the
          corridor's flooded with a BLINDING WHITE LIGHT.
          Anna's dazzled. Shades her eyes with her hand.     As she
          tentatively pulls her hand away...
          ...it's only Jack.   His hand on the light switch.ANNAJack!JACKDid I scare you Miss Bryant?
          Jack moves over to the door.ANNAIt's locked.
          He gently pushes against the door.    The door slowly opens.EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATERAnna, still shaken, walks with Jack towards the parking lot.ANNAShouldn't you be home?JACKMy mom's picking me up.(BEAT)It's my birthday. We're going to
                    MacDonald's. Then on Saturday my mom's
                    taking me to Busch Gardens. We're
                    going to ride the Alpengeist.(EARNESTLY)Continually voted one of the top ten roller
                    coaster rides in America, the Alpengeist is
                    a breathtaking avalanche of adventure.ANNA(tries to keep a straight-face)
                    I didn't know the park was open yet.JACKMy mom's friends with the manager.
                    They're opening it specially for me.
          She knows he's lying again.     Smiles sadly.ANNASounds like fun.JACKYes.    It will be fun.10.They reach Anna's car.    Stand in silence for a moment.ANNAJack. Those boys.    Do they bother you
                     a lot?
          Jack hesitates.    Then slowly nods his head.ANNAYou know you can always talk to me about
                     it if you want to.
          He nods.   Anna's clearly worried about him.ANNAYou sure you don't need a ride?
          Jack shakes his head.    Anna glances at her watch.ANNAWell.   I better run.JACKWhere are you going?ANNA(HESITATES)I have to go to a funeral.   My old piano
                     teacher.JACK(with sudden interest)
                     Can I come?ANNANo Jack.   Funerals are very private
                     affairs.JACKI've never been to a funeral.ANNAIt wouldn't be appropriate Jack. Anyway
                     wouldn't your mom worry about you?JACK(SHRUGS)Not really.ANNAI'm sure she would. I'll see you
                     tomorrow in class. Have a wonderful
                     birthday.
          Jack nods disappointed.   Anna watches him walk away then
          gets in her car.11.INT. ANNA'S CAR - MOMENTS LATERAnna slips her key into the ignition. Loud music suddenly
          blares from the car radio. She switches it off. Squeezes
          the bridge of her nose. She pulls out a bottle of pills
          from her bag. It's empty. She rummages in the glove
          compartment. Finds another bottle. Empty. She sighs.EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATERJack sits on the bench. Watches Anna drive away. Then
          unzips his backpack. Something moves inside. A strange
          jerky movement. Jack closes the backpack. Glances up
          and down the empty street. Then walks away on his own.EXT. STRIP MALL. PHARMACY - DAYAnna steps out of the Pharmacy. As she washes down a pill
          with a bottle of water she notices a small Hair Salon.
          Looks critically at herself in the Pharmacy window.
          Anna moves over to the Salon. Reaches for the door
          handle... then hesitates. She's about to walk away when
          the Salon door suddenly opens. Anna smiles shyly as a
          freshly COIFFURED WOMAN politely holds the door for her.INT. HAIR SALON - DAYAnna leans back against a washbasin.    Her neck tightly
          cradled against the white porcelain.    The light's harsh
          and not particularly flattering. She    closes her eyes.
          Behind her the HANDS of a HAIRDRESSER   in latex gloves
          begin to rinse dye from Anna's hair.ON SINKStartling white. A stream of water flows into the sink.
          Then after a moment the spiralling clear water gradually
          turns a deep crimson red.INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. HALLWAY - DAYAnna closes the front door behind her. She smiles as
          she catches her reflection in the hallway mirror. Her
          hair a dark vibrant red. Just then, from another room,
          we hear an OLD WOMAN'S hacking cough.OLD WOMAN (O.S.)Anna?   Is that you?ANNAYes Mother.12.INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATERAnna's mother, BEATRICE (50s), sits in bed, knitting with
          swift, violent precision. The bedside table's stacked
          with medication. She's clearly been bed-ridden for some
          time. An electric wheelchair in the corner of the room.
          Anna appears at the door. Beatrice scrutinizes her for a
          second. Then returns to her knitting.BEATRICETerrible color.
          Anna moves to the beside table.   Picks up a dirty plate.ANNACan I get you something to eat?BEATRICEI'm not hungry.ANNAYou have to eat.BEATRICEI don't have to do anything.ANNAThe doctor said--BEATRICEThe doctor's an idiot. He doesn't know
                    what he's talking about.
          Anna sighs. Trying hard not to let her Mother provoke
          her. Beatrice glances up. Anna avoids her look.BEATRICEWhy did you do it? Today of all days.ANNAWhat have I done wrong this time?
          Anna goes to the window.   Draws back the curtains.BEATRICEYou've forgotten haven't you?ANNANo I haven't forgotten.   The service
                    isn't till six.BEATRICEThen you've got plenty of time to wash it
                    out.13.ANNAIt's permanent. You can't wash it out.BEATRICEThen dye it back. You can't show up at

                    constantly arguing with me?
          Anna bites her tongue.    Heads to the door.BEATRICEWhere are you going?ANNATo do the washing up.BEATRICEThe sheets need changing.    They haven't
                    been changed in months.ANNAI changed them Monday.
          Anna goes to the cupboard.    Takes out clean sheets.BEATRICEYou weren't here Monday. You never sleep
                    at home anymore. What if something
                    happened to me in the middle of the night?ANNANothing is going to happen to you.ANYWAY DIANE--BEATRICE(SNORTS)Fat lot of good she is. I wouldn't have
                    to pay for a Nurse if my only daughter
                    wasn't living in sin with that lawyer of
                    hers. Doing God knows what. They always
                    leave you in the end. You'll see. Just
                    like your father--ANNAThat's enough Mother!
          Anna dumps the sheets on the bed. As she turns to leave
          Beatrice's hand darts out and grabs Anna's wrist.BEATRICEThat's it.     Go and cry to Paul.14.Anna pulls herself free.   Moves to the door.BEATRICEGo and bitch to Paul about your mean old

          HUTTON (60s) to the body of her husband, JAMES HUTTON
          (70S), lying in the casket. Mrs. Hutton touches a
          bouquet of white roses by the casket.MRS. HUTTONWhite roses. They were his favorite.
                    How did you know?ELIOTThey just seemed appropriate somehow.MRS. HUTTONHe looks so peaceful. As if he's only
                    sleeping.
          Anna approaches Mrs. Hutton.   She doesn't notice Eliot
          watching her carefully.ANNAMrs. Hutton.    I'm so sorry.MRS. HUTTONThank you Anna. You were always his

          But we can see in her eyes that everything's not fine.
          Mrs. Hutton nods, then turns to greet another MOURNER.
          Anna steps nervously up to the coffin.ANNA'S POVJames Hutton lies peacefully amongst the velvet trimming.
          Suddenly his LIPS PART... as he GASPS SOFTLY.VIEWING ROOMAnna steps back terrified. Stares at Hutton. His face
          serene again. It must have been her imagination. She
          glances up quickly. Embarrassed.
          Eliot's still observing her.     He nods to her cordially.INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - DAYA spartan room at the top of the house. Eliot carefully
          pins a POLAROID of Hutton lying in a coffin to the wall.
          Next to Hutton's photograph, we briefly glimpse the edge
          of ANOTHER POLAROID.
          Eliot stares intently at Hutton's image for a moment,
          then takes off his jacket and moves to the window.ELIOT'S POVAnna's by her car rummaging in a bag for her keys.
          Getting increasingly frustrated.EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - DAYAnna suddenly looses it. Angrily dumps the contents of
          her bag onto the driveway. She kneels down. Grabs the
          keys. Throws the rest of her things back into the bag.
          She stands. Leans against the car. She looks weary.
          She glances up at the sky desperately trying to hold back
          her tears. Black storm clouds gather on the horizon.16.Anna brusquely wipes away her eyes with the back of her
          hand. Pulls herself together. Angry with herself.INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - DAYEliot watches intently as Anna drives away.INT. RESTAURANT - EVENINGPaul sits at a window table. It's raining hard outside.
          He glances at his watch then nervously checks his

          moment then slips it back into his pocket.
          As he refills his glass, Anna appears outside holding her
          raincoat above her head. She stares at Paul for a moment
          through the window marbled with rain.
          Paul suddenly notices Anna at the window.   He starts.
          Spills some of his red wine on his shirt.
          CLOSE on the red stain. It unfurls like a flower.
          Spreading out over the white material.ANNA (O.C.)Sorry about that.
          Paul dabs the stain with a napkin.PAULYou scared the life out of me.
          Anna laughs as she sits down.   Paul looks up at her.PAULYour hair.ANNAYou don't like it.PAULI didn't say that. It's just very...
                    red. I mean it's not really you is it?
          A WAITER appears at the table before Anna can reply.WAITERAre you ready to order?PAULYes.    We'll have the duck.ANNAPaul.17.PAULWhat?    You always have the duck here.ANNA(picks up the menu)
                    I don't always have the duck.
          Paul shrugs. Pours Anna some wine as she looks through
          the menu. The Waiter taps his pen on his pad
          impatiently. Anna sighs. Puts the menu aside.ANNAI'll have the duck.
          Paul smiles as the Waiter leaves. Anna tries to ignore
          him. But after a second she can't help smiling back.PAULThe duck is very good.
          Anna's smile broadens. The tension between them broken
          for the moment. Paul reaches across. Touches her hand.PAULLet's not argue tonight.    OK?ANNAOK.Anna takes a sip of wine.ANNAThis is good.
          She picks up the bottle.    Checks the label.ANNAAnd looks very expensive...(SMILES QUESTIONINGLY)What's the special occasion?
          Paul's momentarily thrown. He tries to cover it by
          rearranging his napkin. Anna notices.PAUL(suddenly very serious)
                    Actually there is something I need to
                    talk to you about.

                    office in Chicago.
          Anna looks down.   Stares at her hands on the table.18.PAULIt'll mean more work of course. More
                    responsibility. A lot of changes. But
                    it's an incredible opportunity. I'd be
                    crazy to turn it down. And...(NERVOUS)...well I've been thinking. Maybe it's

          Paul pauses as he reaches inside his jacket.ANNA(without looking up)
                    You're going to leave me.
          Paul's stunned.   Speechless.   Before he can say anything--ANNAYou could've just told me this morning.

                    expensive meal.

          Trying desperately to pull herself together.

          battle with the TORRENTIAL DOWNPOUR. A LARGE TRUCK plows
          past menacingly on the rain-slicked highway.
          Anna's still upset. She wipes away her tears. On the
          dashboard the kitschy doll bobs its head from side to
          side. Anna picks up her cell phone. Glances down as she
          dials a number. She looks up...
          a WHITE VAN with black tinted windows cuts in front of her.ANNAShit!
          Anna swerves into the next lane.      We hear the blaring

          CLOSE ON a MAN'S HANDS. Turning slowly under a stream of
          crystal blue water. We pull back. Eliot dries his hands.
          Opens a cabinet. Takes out a pair of latex gloves.INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - EARLY MORNINGA large room. Tall vaulted ceilings. White tiles. Soft
          morning light seeps in from a small round window set high
          on one wall. The room is silent. Still. Like a chapel.
          In the semi-darkness we see a BODY on a porcelain slab
          covered with a white sheet.
          We hear a key turn in a lock. Then another lock.       The
          room's suddenly flooded with a harsh white light.
          Eliot steps inside the room. He takes off his jacket.
          Carefully places it on a coat-hanger. Puts on a pale
          blue smock then snaps on the latex gloves. His every
          move meticulous. Measured. Like a ritual.
          Eliot walks over to the slab, his surgery clogs softly
          clacking against the tiled floor. He looks at the slab
          for a moment then slowly pulls the sheet away
          revealing...
          ANNA'S BODY. Pale and lifeless. An ugly gash above her
          eyebrow. Cracked violet lips. A rip in her black dress
          soaked with a dark stain. She's only wearing one shoe.
          Eliot gently takes off the watch from her stiff wrist.
          Places it inside a brown paper bag. Eases off the shoe.
          Picks up a scalpel from a tray of instruments on a steel
          trolley. Delicately slices open her dress. Peels it off.
          He's about to cut the straps of her RED SLIP when...
          Anna OPENS HER EYES.
          She looks straight at us with unseeing pale blue eyes.
          Strangely Eliot's not surprised.   He calmly steps back.
          Watches her carefully.
          Anna's eyes slowly focus on Eliot.     She's groggy.   Confused.22.ANNAWhere am I?
          She talks with difficulty.       Her breathe labored.ELIOTYou're in a funeral home.(BEAT)You're dead.
          Anna's vacant eyes widen in shock. She struggles to sit
          up but she can't even raise her head. Her body stiff.
          Rigid. Eliot speaks to her calmly. Soothingly.ELIOTYou had a car accident. It was raining.
                      You hit a truck loaded with metal pipes.
          She looks fearfully at the bloodied dress in Eliot's hand.ANNAI'm not dead.ELIOTYou were pronounced dead eight hours ago.
                      Your blood no longer circulates through

                      dying. Your body's already decomposing.ANNAI'm not dead.
          Eliot looks at her sadly for a moment. He places the
          bloodied dress on the trolley. Then picks up a document.
          Holds it up for her.ON DOCUMENTIt's Anna's death certificate.ELIOT (O.C.)This is your death certificate. Cause of

                      this morning.
          Anna stares with horror at her death certificate, then at
          Eliot. He looks away. It pains him to see her so
          distressed.23.ELIOTI'm sorry.
          Eliot picks up a sponge from the trolley.   Wets it.ANNAWho are you?
          Eliot delicately washes Anna's face. She doesn't flinch
          as he dabs the wound above her eye brow.ANNADon't touch me! Why are you touching me?ELIOTI'm preparing your body. You have to
                    look beautiful for your funeral.ANNAI'm not dead.
          Eliot sighs wearily.   As if he'd had this conversation
          many times before.ELIOTYou all say the same thing.(BEAT)I'm sorry. Maybe you should rest now.
          Eliot peels off his latex gloves and heads for the door.
          As he hangs his pale blue smock on the peg he turns and
          looks at Anna for a moment.ON ANNAThe lights go off. O.S. the door clicks shut as it locks

          Sunlight streams into the room. Blinding him. He
          reaches across. The bed's empty. He's surprised for a
          moment then remembers the argument the night before.
          He gets up. Sits on the edge of the bed. Lights a
          cigarette. He notices his jacket on the floor. Leans
          down. As he pulls out the BlackBerry from his jacket, the
          RING BOX falls onto the floor. Paul doesn't notice.24.INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - LATERPaul steps into the kitchen. Nervously checking his

                    just don't want it to end like this.

          push a NAKED BODY wrapped in plastic through the morgue.
          They jump as they hear the MUFFLED sound of a cell phone.
          The ringing comes from a bag speckled with blood lying on
          a table (we recognize it as Anna's bag). The Assistant
          walks over. Takes out the cell phone.ASSISTANTIt's the schoolteacher's. From the car

          side. Staring blankly at the wall. Her eyes glazed.
          Suddenly classical music fills the room. Anna frowns.
          Disoriented. She moves her head with difficulty.
          Nervously looks around.
          For a moment she doesn't know where she is. Then she
          sees Eliot by a CD player. She watches with trepidation

                    trust me. I'm only here to help you.
          Eliot slides a wooden head-rest under her neck and studies
          her wounds, touching them delicately. Thinking about how
          to conceal them. He turns to a tray of instruments.
          Picks up a needle. Leans over Anna.
          The needle pierces her brow. Sliding cleanly through her
          skin. She doesn't feel any pain as Eliot carefully sews
          the wound. He's meticulous. Clearly very good at his job.
          Eliot glances at his watch. Picks up a SYRINGE and an
          AMPOULE OF AMBER LIQUID. Draws up the amber liquid.
          Anna's alarmed. She tries to pull back.ELIOTDon't be scared.ANNAWhat are you doing?ELIOTThis will relax your muscles. Stop the

          noise. He looks up...
          The KITSCHY DOLL. Its head NODDING SLOWLY. Its smiling
          face now unnaturally sinister. Turning towards us until
          it abruptly stops. Staring straight at us.
          Paul looks at the doll transfixed. Just then a PALE
          WOMAN'S HAND slowly reaches through the window... and
          touches Paul's shoulder. He jumps. Turns.

          face with the SCISSORS.
          The sharp edge misses his cheek by inches. Eliot drops
          the bowl. Stumbles back against the steel trolley.
          Instruments crash to the floor.
          Anna staggers to the door. Her legs weak. Her long lank
          hair falling over her eyes. She frantically wrenches at
          the door handle but it's locked. Eliot gets up. Slowly
          moves towards Anna. She turns. Raises the scissors.ANNAStay where you are.41.ELIOT(holds out his hand)

          faucet. Slow. Rhythmical. Anna opens her eyes. Stares
          at us. Terrified. Then she turns her head.
          The Old Woman sits on the other slab. Slowly brushing
          her tangled gray hair with a silver backed brush.
          Anna looks around anxiously. The room is strangely
          larger. The perspective not quite right. Certain
          objects look absurdly small or abnormally large. She
          notices a TINY DOOR. Half hidden by a steel trolley.
          The door's slightly ajar. Anna's surprised.
          The Old Woman shakes her head. Staring blindly at Anna
          with opaque eyes. Anna ignores her. Moves quickly to
          the tiny door. As she approaches, the door seems to grow
          to normal size.
          Then we realize it's Anna who has shrunk. The steel
          trolley now towers high above her. The massive
          instruments on the trolley look like menacing insects
          cast in surgical steel. She opens the door. Revealing a
          solid wall of DARKNESS.FROM INSIDE THE DARKNESSthe small shape of Anna in the doorway. The huge dark
          space engulfs her. The only light comes from the Prep
          Room behind her.PREP ROOMAnna reaches forward. Her hand disappears into the thick
          blackness. She snatches her hand back. Scared. Then...
          ...a CHILD'S HAND darts out of the darkness. Grabs Anna's
          wrist. Pulling her in with surprising strength. Anna
          struggles to free herself. But the hand drags her deeper
          into the darkness. The door slams shut behind her.INT. DARKNESSAnna stands in the black empty space.GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)I'm disappointed with you.
          An innocent looking YOUNG GIRL (6) materializes out of

          Anna shakes her head.GIRLI am you. I've been waiting for you.
                      You shouldn't have disappointed me.
          The Girl now looks strangely malevolent. Anna steps back
          terrified. Turns. But there's no door anymore.INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIMEThe Old Woman stands alone in the middle of the room.

          She's confused. She gets up awkwardly. Looks around the
          room. The other slab's empty. The Old Woman's gone.
          Anna stumbles over to the trolley. Pushes it aside.
          Desperately searching for the tiny door. She touches the
          wall. There's nothing there. Frustrated she turns to a
          counter crowded with instruments. She sweeps her arm
          across the counter top in rage. Sending everything
          crashing to the floor.INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - DAYThe funeral's over. Eliot takes out a wilted bouquet of
          flowers from a vase.47.In the b.g. Jack stands half-hidden in the doorway.

          Jack holds out his hand. A serious look on his face.
          Eliot's amused. He shakes Jack's hand.ELIOTWell Jack.      What did you think?JACKAbout what?ELIOTMrs. Whitehall's funeral.     Did you find

          Eliot finished arranging the flowers.     He glances at his
          watch. Smiles at Jack.ELIOTIt was a pleasure talking to you Jack.49.Jack's intrigued.   He watches Eliot walk out of the room.INT. FUNERAL HOME. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATERAs Eliot heads to the Prep Room, we hear a MUFFLED CRASH
          from inside. Eliot quickly pulls out his keys. Moves to
          the door. Just then Eliot hears a creaking sound behind
          him. He turns. Jack's at the top of the stairs.
          Staring down curiously at the Prep Room door.
          Eliot observes him cautiously. Did Jack hear the sound
          as well? Jack looks back at Eliot. Smiles. Then
          without a word, turns and heads back up the stairs.INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - MOMENTS LATERAnna sits on the floor in the middle of the room.
          Hugging her legs to her chest. Rocking to and fro.
          Surrounded by broken glass, torn papers and instruments.
          Eliot enters the room. Coldly surveys the destruction.ELIOT(ANGRY)Why did you do this?
          Anna ignores him.   Eliot strides over to her.ELIOTWHY DID YOU DO THIS?Anna stares at him blankly.ANNAIs this the afterlife?    Am I in heaven?
                    Or am I in hell?
          Strangely Eliot's not surprised.   He nods his head.   His
          anger gone now.ANNAThe door...(POINTS DISTRACTEDLY)There was a door. Just there.ELIOT(GENTLY)It won't be long now.ANNAI used to believe in God. I thought I'd
                    see him when I died. Instead I saw you.
          Eliot softly strokes her hair.    Comforting her.50.ANNA(WHISPERS)Maybe you are God.ELIOTYou'll be at peace soon.     I promise.
          For a moment we see a deep sadness in Eliot's eyes. He's
          conflicted. But then abruptly he pulls himself together.
          Moves away and starts clearing up. Anna closes her eyes.
          Hugs her legs closer to her chest.ANNAPaul.
          She lets out a DESPONDENT SIGH.   The SIGH carries into
          the next scene...EXT. CEMETERY - DAYThe tall trees stand motionless amongst the graves. A
          sudden GUST OF WIND bends the dense foliage. Their
          leaves ripple. Languid and fluid like a wave. RUSTLING
          EERILY. The sound almost malevolent.INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BEDROOM - DAYPaul's red-rimmed eyes snap open. He lies on his bed
          fully clothed. An empty bottle of bourbon on the bedside
          table. Behind him the curtains stir.
          The KITSCHY DOLL'S head begins to slowly nod. Turning
          towards us. We hear the eerie rustling sound again.
          Like a MURMURING WHISPER...ANNA (O.S.)(WHISPERS)Paul.
          Paul turns quickly. Sees the open window. It's only the
          wind. He shivers. It suddenly got very cold. He gets
          up and closes the window. The WHISPERING starts again.
          This time from the bathroom.
          Paul walks over to the bathroom door. As he touches the
          door handle... the whispering STOPS. Paul hesitates.
          The room's strangely silent. He slowly opens the door...INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUSNothing. The bathroom's empty. Paul looks around
          nervously. He catches the reflection of his pallid face
          in the mirror. Leans wearily against the washbasin.51.Water DRIPS from a leaky pipe. The fluorescent bulb over
          the mirror CRACKLES softly. Paul turns on the taps.
          Splashes cold water on his face. He's about to reach for
          a towel when he senses something. He cocks his head
          slightly. A feeling.
          He turns and checks out the bathroom. Nothing. Paul
          dries his face. As he replaces the towel... the sound of
          dripping water ABRUPTLY STOPS. Silence.
          Suddenly the SHOWER STARTS RUNNING.
          Paul's paralyzed with fear. Steam wreathes the room in a
          cloud of vapor. He turns slowly towards the shower.PAUL'S POVAnna stands in front of the shower with her back to him.
          She slips off her bathrobe and hangs it on a hook. Then
          her hand moves to her chest. There's a STRANGE WET
          SUCKING sound...

          the hook next to her bathrobe.ON THE STILL BEATING HEARTdripping crimson blood onto the bone white tiles.BATHROOMPAUL(WHISPERS)Anna.
          Anna turns slowly. Her skin's like alabaster. Unnaturally
          translucent. A bloody gash where her heart used to be.
          The steam from the shower curls around her like a mist.
          She looks hauntingly beautiful. Mesmerizing. A line of
          thick black fluid trickles from her nose. Paul turns
          away. Horrified. When he turns back a second later
          Anna's not there. The bathroom's empty. The shower's
          not even running.INT. JACK'S HOUSE. KITCHEN - EVENINGJack opens the fridge. It's almost empty. He takes out
          a carton of milk. Sniffs it. Recoils from the smell.
          From the living room we hear the LOUD sound of a TV.JACK(SHOUTS)Mom!    We're out of milk.
          There's no reply.      Jack grabs his jacket.52.INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - EVENINGAnna's still sitting on the floor. The place is clean
          and ordered again. She watches Eliot unzip a garment
          bag. He lifts out a plain black dress.ANNAWhat's that?ELIOTIt's your dress. For your funeral. Your
                      mother brought it round this morning.
          As Eliot takes out a pair of shiny black shoes from a
          plastic bag, Anna moves haltingly over to the dress. She
          touches the material puzzled.ANNAThis isn't my dress.

                      supposed to be for her funeral. Why has
                      she given it to me?
          Eliot starts folding the plastic bag. He notices
          something else inside. He opens the bag. Hesitates then
          takes something out.ON ELIOT'S HANDAn old-fashioned wooden rosary.PREP ROOMEliot looks at it for a moment. Then glances over at
          Anna. She's still staring at the dress. He opens a
          drawer beneath the counter. It's full of rosaries and
          printed Holy cards. He quickly drops the rosary into the
          drawer. Closes it. Then turns back to Anna.ANNAIt should have been her not me.

                      She was the one dying. Not me.
          Eliot unlocks the door. Jams it open with a door stop.
          Slips his keys back into his jacket pocket. Takes off
          his jacket and hangs it up. He moves over to a
          collapsible gurney folded on the floor. Bends down and
          snaps open the side-rails. Anna looks at the open door.ANNAI'm not ready to die.
          Eliot looks up at Anna sadly.53.ELIOTWhy are you still struggling?ANNA(PLAINTIVELY)I'm not ready to die.   Not yet.
          She glances at the open door again.    Eliot follows her look.ELIOTThere's nothing out there for you
                      anymore.
          As Eliot turns back to the gurney, Anna notices Eliot's
          jacket hanging beside her. Realizes the KEYS are in the
          pocket. She quickly glances back at Eliot. He's still
          busy adjusting the gurney. She leans over to his jacket.ON ELIOTas he gets up and turns to Anna.PREP ROOMAnna looks at him calmly. We can't tell if she managed to
          get his keys or not. Eliot pulls on his jacket and wheels

          SNAPS OFF LOUDLY in the lock.ANNANo!
          Anna looks around desperately. Sees a tray of instruments

          It's a PHOTOGRAPH of Paul and Anna together on vacation.

          ball of wax in his hands to warm it up. He gently moves
          Frank's head to one side. In the b.g. Anna lies on her
          slab watching Eliot work.ANNA'S POVFrank stares back at her with open dull eyes. His face
          partially reconstructed with plaster of Paris.PREP ROOMEliot smooths the wax over the plaster to give Frank's
          face a more natural texture. Then picks up a piece of
          wire with a fishhook-like barb at each end.ANNA (O.C.)What's that for?
          Eliot looks up surprised. Anna stands beside him.        He
          leans down. Peels back Frank's upper lip.66.ELIOTHis mouth.   To keep it closed.
          Eliot imbeds one barb into the upper gum then pries back
          Frank's lower lip. He attaches the other barb into the
          lower gum, then twists the wires tightly together. He
          picks up two plastic caps covered in small knobs.ELIOTNow his eyes.
          He inserts the caps into Frank's eyes. Pulls his eyelids
          over them. Glues the eyelids together.ANNAIs this how you'll prepare my body?
          Eliot looks at her for a moment.   Smiles reassuringly.ELIOTNo. There's no need. I had to rebuild
                    his face. You're still beautiful.ANNADoes he have family?ELIOTYes.    A brother. He's coming in later.
          Anna touches the white sheet covering Frank's body.ANNAMy mother... She didn't cry did she?

          We see a brief flicker of pain in Anna's eyes.67.ANNAI knew he wouldn't.     He always got
                    upset when I cried.     He said crying
                    never helped.
          Anna suddenly looks very weary. She leans heavily
          against the slab. As if she's about to fall.ELIOTYou should rest.
          He guides her back to the slab.    Helps her lie down.ELIOTYou're getting weaker.    It's almost time.

          A long beat.ELIOTTo make life important.
          Anna's fingers curl around his hand. Like a vulnerable
          child. Totally trusting in him. Eliot looks down at Anna
          sadly. We sense he's conflicted. Confused. Wavering.
          But then reluctantly he reaches for a SYRINGE filled with
          AMBER LIQUID on the steel trolley. He injects her gently
          in the neck. Watches over her for a moment. Then moves
          to the window. He picks up a window pole. Pulls the
          shutter across the window plunging the room into darkness.INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAYEliot moves through the Funeral Home pulling heavy drapes
          over the windows and closing doors. It feels like a
          ritual. The once airy sunlit rooms are darker now. More
          ominous. Claustrophobic.INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - DAYCLOSE ON a stream of crystal blue water.    We pull back.
          Eliot picks up a white towel. Dries his hands. Deep in
          thought. He moves to his desk. Picks up a Polaroid.68.ON POLAROIDThe Old Woman, Mrs. Whitehall, lying in her casket.ELIOT (O.C.)Mrs. Whitehall. Susan. I hope you found

          to him.ELIOTThink nothing of it Mr. Houseman.    No
                    need to apologize.
          Eliot moves over to the wall.ELIOTI really enjoyed our time together.
          We pull back slowly. Eliot's talking to a POLAROID of an
          OLD MAN. We pull back further... the wall's covered in
          HUNDREDS OF POLAROIDS of BODIES in open coffins.
          Most of them have closed eyes but we glimpse some with
          their eyes wide open. Eerily staring at us. Eliot
          touches the Polaroid of a YOUNG MAN. We see the fear in
          the Young Man's eyes.ELIOT (O.C.)Anthony.    Anthony. Always confused.
          Just then we hear the doorbell ringing downstairs.    Eliot
          moves to the window.ELIOT'S POVA POLICE OFFICER stands at the front door.    A SQUAD CAR

          Eliot glances at his watch.   Smiles at Vincent.ELIOTIt's no trouble at all.INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - MOMENTS LATEREliot leads Vincent to Frank's covered body. Vincent
          looks over at Anna. The white sheet only comes to her
          shoulders, her head facing straight upwards.ELIOTYour brother's here.
          Vincent turns back to Eliot. We're not sure if Eliot was
          speaking to Frank or to Vincent. Eliot pulls the sheet
          away. Frank's face is flawless. No sign of any damage.VINCENTHe looks so peaceful. You've done a
                    beautiful job. Thank-you.ELIOTYou should remember him as he used to be.
          Suddenly we hear a FAINT RUSTLING sound. Vincent glances
          again at Anna's body. Her head is now turned to one side.
          Wasn't she facing upwards a moment ago? Vincent's puzzled
          for a second then shrugs. Must have been his imagination.VINCENTThat's the schoolteacher isn't it?
          Eliot pulls the sheet over Anna's face.ELIOT(QUICKLY)Yes. Very tragic. Now is there anything
                    else I can help you with?
          Vincent frowns.   Turns back to Eliot.70.VINCENTSomething's not right here.ELIOT(looks up sharply)

          Eliot hesitates.      Then smiles.ELIOTNo.   Not at all. I'll wait outside.
          As Eliot leaves, Vincent looks at Frank's body. After a
          moment he glances at Anna again. Then at the door. He
          quickly moves over to Anna. Looks at her curiously then
          pulls down the sheet. He reaches over... and CARESSES
          HER BREAST. Mesmerized by her naked body.
          As Vincent's hand moves down her body, he bumps against
          the trolley. Instruments CRASH to the floor. He pulls
          back the sheet just as Eliot enters the room.VINCENTI'm sorry.    I didn't see...71.Eliot notices the sheet covering Anna's body is slightly
          askew. He reaches over and straightens it. Then looks
          coldly at Vincent. There's an uncomfortable silence.VINCENTWell. I guess I should be off then. I'll
                      see you at the service. Thanks again.
          Vincent glances one last time at Anna then leaves. The
          door locking shut behind him. Eliot stares at the door.ELIOTI just told you. That was your brother.

          Frank doesn't move.    His mouth still wired shut.ELIOTNo.   It's not a gift.   It's a curse.
          Eliot picks up a compact. Roughly layers Frank's cheeks
          with thick rouge. With every word he gets more agitated.ELIOTI take care of each of you as if you were

          Eliot's extremely irritated now.     He grabs a garish red
          lipstick. Smears Frank's lips.ELIOTYou argue with me. As if it were my fault
                      you're dead. As if I was to blame.

          himself as he digs a grave. Working meticulously. Like
          everything else he does. Suddenly a SHADOW falls over
          Eliot. He calmly looks up. The sun's behind the figure.
          For a moment Eliot can't tell who it is.JACKYou said you could teach me.
          Eliot smiles. Gestures to Jack to come inside the grave.

          She talks with difficulty now. Her voice SLURRED and
          HOARSE. Her words muddled and rambling. Her eyes even

                    You let him go.ANNAHe'll be all right now?    Won't he?

          over his arm, picks up a pair of shiny black shoes and
          moves over to her.ANNA(CONFUSED)Why do I have to get dressed?ELIOTTomorrow's your funeral.
          Eliot lifts Anna's arms and puts them through the sleeves
          of the dress. Her body's stiff and unyielding.ANNAAlready?ELIOTI told you.   You only had three days.
          He delicately turns her onto her side.    Buttons up the dress.ELIOTI told you to use your time well.
          Anna frowns. As if trying to remember something. Eliot
          gently lifts her legs. Pulls on a pair of black tights.ANNAI need to... I have so many regrets.     I
                    have nothing but regrets.84.She looks up at him.   Suddenly realizing.ANNAThat's why I'm here isn't it?      To be

          Eliot stops clipping her nails.   Irritated.ELIOTWhat did you really want from life?ANNAI just wanted to be happy.ELIOT(DERISIVELY)Happy? You all say you wanted to be happy.

          over a chair and sits next to Anna. Places the violets

          off the front and fans   it in the air. Then...91.ON ANNA...delicately closes Anna's eyelids.ELIOT (O.C.)Good bye Anna.INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOONAnna's funeral is in progress.   Eliot stands by her
          casket. Surrounded by wreathes of tulips and lilies.
          Beatrice, in her wheelchair, in the front row. Diane
          beside her. A SCHOOLTEACHER sits behind them with Jack
          and other CHILDREN.FATHER GRAHAM (O.C.)I am the resurrection and the life.

                      die, will live.
          Tom and Paul appear at the door.   Tom guides Paul to a
          seat near the back.FATHER GRAHAM (O.C.)They that sleep in the earth will awake
                      and shout for joy; and the earth will
                      bring those long dead to birth again.ON CASKETAnna lies in an open casket. Her eyes closed.     She can
          hear the DISTORTED VOICE of the Priest.FATHER GRAHAM (O.C.)We have come here today to remember
                      before God our sister Anna. To give
                      thanks for her life.ON ANNA'S FACEWe see an almost imperceptible frown.VIEWING ROOMEliot gestures to Beatrice. Diane wheels her to the casket.
          Beatrice looks at Anna for a moment, then touches the
          violets in Anna's hands.DIANEViolets. They were her favorite flowers.

                      How did you know?ELIOTViolets just seemed appropriate somehow.92.Next we see Mrs. Hutton at the casket. Then Jack. He
          stares at Anna's body before being moved on by the
          Schoolteacher. Finally Paul and Tom approach the coffin.PAUL'S POVAnna looks serene.VIEWING ROOMPaul takes out the ring box from his pocket. Gently
          slides the engagement ring onto Anna's stiff finger.
          Suddenly he looks alarmed. Turns quickly to Tom.TOM(WHISPERS)What is it?PAULShe's so cold.
          Paul turns back to Anna.    Tears prick his eyes. He
          touches her cheek again.    Finally accepting her death.PAULI'm sorry Anna.
          He kisses her lips. Eliot watches him carefully. It's
          almost as if he's jealous. Jack notices Eliot's look
          then turns and stares at Paul.
          As Paul and Tom walk away Eliot closes the casket.
          Begins to screw down the lid.INT. INSIDE THE CASKET - SAME TIMEIt's dark. We hear the screws TIGHTENING.      Anna's eyes
          FLICKER OPEN then close again.INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - SAME TIMEJust then Paul turns back sharply.      As if he sensed
          Anna's reaction inside the casket.      Tom gently stops him.TOM(shakes his head)
                       She's at peace now.
          Paul glances at the casket again, then reluctantly allows
          Tom to lead him away.
          Eliot tightens the last screw. His back to the room.
          Suddenly the screwdriver slips. Gashes his finger.93.ON COFFINA drop of blood falls onto the polished wood.VIEWING ROOMEliot stares at the blood for a moment. Takes out a
          pristine white handkerchief. Carefully wipes off the
          blood. Then places his hand on the coffin.ELIOT(SOFTLY)Don't be scared. It's better this way.
          Eliot turns.   Signals to the PALLBEARERS standing nearby.EXT. CEMETERY. ANNA'S GRAVE - LATE AFTERNOONThe Pallbearers slowly lower Anna's casket into the open
          grave. The casket lurches as it settles in the grave.INT. INSIDE THE CASKET - SAME TIMEAnna's eyes SNAP OPEN in terror. She tries to scream out.
          But only a SOFT RATTLING WHISPER escapes from her throat.EXT. CEMETERY. ANNA'S GRAVE - SAME TIMEThe TEACHER throws a handful of earth onto the coffin.
          Jack steps up. Looks down curiously. As if he could
          sense Anna. Then slowly pours the soil from his hand.FATHER GRAHAM (O.C.)We have but a short time to live. Like a
                      flower we blossom and then wither. In

          Anna GASPS softly. Hyperventilating. The earth keeps
          falling. The sound becoming SOFTER with each shovelful.
          She struggles. Bangs her fists against the wood.EXT. CEMETERY. ANNA'S GRAVE - LATERThe grave's covered with a stone slab now. Votive candles

          Tom squeezes Paul's shoulder then walks away.INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - SAME TIMEEliot carefully pins Anna's Polaroid to the wall.ON POLAROIDSWe pan slowly across the other photographs we saw before.
          But now we look at them differently. In some faces there
          is the glimmer of life. In some a despairing pleading
          look. In others passive resignation.ELIOT'S ROOMEliot moves towards the window.ELIOT'S POVThe dark cemetery. In the distance flickering candles
          illuminate Anna's grave.ELIOT (O.C.)Imagine Anna. The whole world, your

                    to happen to them. Until it's their turn

          Eliot glances at his watch.ELIOT...think about it while you still can.EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATERPaul unlocks his car. He's about to open the car door
          when he feels someone watching him. He turns. Jack's
          observing him carefully.PAULYou said she was alive.95.JACKI never said she was alive.     I just said
                       I saw her.
          Paul simply nods his head.        Too drained of emotion to react.PAULYou need a ride?
          Jack shakes his head.PAULOK.   See you.
          Paul opens the car door.JACKMr. Conran?(PAUL TURNS)Don't forget to fasten your seat belt.

          Paul fills a glass with whiskey. Knocks it back in one.

                       drink?
          Paul turns. Eliot stands beside him.        Paul pours himself
          another drink.PAULGo to hell.

          Eliot's suddenly tired of Paul's allegations.ELIOTMr. Conran. You come to my Funeral
                    Home, making wild accusations. You have
                    no idea what happens when someone dies.
                    What happens to their body. What
                    happens to their soul.(TAUNTING)You think Anna was alive after the
                    accident? Maybe you're right.
          Paul's stunned.ELIOTMaybe she's still alive. You obviously
                    don't believe a word I say. So why don't

                    Find out whether she's alive or dead.
          Paul grabs Eliot by his lapels.   Shoves him against the wall.PAUL(LOUDLY)You twisted fuck.
          The room's SILENT. Everyone turns towards Paul.   Eliot
          whispers in Paul's ear.ELIOTYou don't have much time left.
          Father Graham puts his hand on Paul's arm.FATHER GRAHAMPlease.   Paul. You're not well.
          Paul pushes his hand away. Eliot shakes his head sadly.

          SCRATCHING at the coffin lid.INT/EXT. PAUL'S CAR. ROAD - NIGHTPaul drives fast. Accelerating then quickly braking as
          he weaves through heavy traffic. He comes up behind a
          slow Tractor-Trailer. Hits the HORN.PAULCome on.   Come on.
          He swerves into the middle of the road. There's a blind
          curve ahead... suddenly an SUV comes out of the corner.
          A bright white light sweeps through his car.     Paul's
          momentarily blinded.THE SCREEN FLASHES TO WHITE.Paul opens his eyes. The ROAD'S EMPTY. No sign of any
          traffic. He's confused. The road was busy a moment ago.
          Just then flashing red and orange lights illuminate the
          car. Paul looks in his rear-view mirror.ON REARVIEW MIRRORAn AMBULANCE moves quickly towards him.     Blasts past.CARPaul looks through the front windshield.     Nothing.   He
          frowns. Where did the ambulance go?UP AHEADWe see the Funeral Home.   Bone white in the moonlight.

          distance the candles still burn on Anna's grave.98.EXT. CEMETERY. ANNA'S GRAVE - MOMENTS LATERPaul grabs a shovel by the grave. Starts digging. Then
          the shovel clunks against wood. He kneels down. Scrapes
          away the earth from the coffin. Then pulls open the lid.
          Anna's eyes are WIDE OPEN.     Her fingernails torn and bloody.
          Paul grabs her shoulders. Pulls her out of the grave.      Her
          body slumps limply like a rag doll.PAULAnna.   I'm here. Please God.     Anna.
          He desperately tries to revive her. But there's no life
          left in her. He's about to give up when...
          Anna's hand TWITCHES. Then after a moment she GASPS.
          Her eyes slowly focus on Paul.ANNAPaul?PAULBaby.   Thank God.
          Paul gently helps Anna to her feet.    She looks round.
          Dazed. Turns back to Paul.ANNAYou came back for me.PAULI came back for you.     You're safe now.ANNAPromise?PAUL(SMILES)Promise.
          Just then Paul hears a rustling sound behind him. He
          turns. Nothing. He cocks his head slightly. There's
          something unnerving about the silence.
          Suddenly a CROW rises noisily into the air. Paul starts.
          Then watches, relieved, as the crow disappears into the
          dark sky. He turns back to Anna... she's not there.PAULAnna?
          Paul looks round desperately. Runs between the stone
          crosses and statues of grieving angels searching for her.99.PAULAnna!
          Just then he glimpses SOMETHING MOVE among the trees.
          Runs over. Nothing. The cemetery is empty. The trees
          appear to SHIMMER for a moment. Paul shivers. Pulls his
          jacket around him. He doesn't notice the candles on
          Anna's grave behind him suddenly BLOW OUT.INT/EXT. ELIOT'S VAN. ROAD - NIGHTWe hear the sound of a SIREN. The AMBULANCE blasts past.

          calling out for Anna.PAULAnna!
          Suddenly the interior light in his car comes on.    Paul
          looks at the car nervously.
          He heads over to it.   Apprehensive.   Then... the car door
          slowly CLICKS open.
          Paul stops.   Stares into the car.   There's no one there.INT. PAUL'S CAR - MOMENTS LATERThrough the windshield we see Paul approach the car.
          He peers in nervously. Then cautiously gets in. As he
          switches the interior light off, the camera moves slowly
          around him revealing...
          ... ANNA sitting in the passenger seat.ANNAAre we going home?
          Paul turns sharply.    Stunned.   Anna moves towards him.ANNAOr do you want to make love here?PAULWhere did you go?
          Anna puts her fingers on Paul's lips. Clearly turned on.
          We hear the sound of something being UNZIPPED.100.ANNA(WHISPERS)I've been waiting for you.    I missed you
                    so much.
          A line of BLOOD trickles from his nose. He touches his
          lips. Looks blankly at the blood on his fingertips. A
          drop of blood falls on Paul's white shirt. It unfurls
          like a flower. Spreading out over the material.ANNAI love you.   I always did.
          Anna hungrily kisses him. He responds passionately.
          Suddenly we hear a SHARP METALLIC SOUND.PAUL(ALARMED)What was that?
          Anna responds as if it was nothing strange.ANNAIt's only the scissors...
          We see the growing anxiety in Paul's eyes.    Anna's just
          interested in his lips.PAULScissors?   What scissors?ANNAScissors. For your clothes.    Eliot just
                    put them on the table.
          Paul pulls back.   Terrified.ANNAYou're safe now. We're finally together.
          A strong bright light sweeps across Paul's face. Like
          the headlights of the car on the blind curve earlier.FADE TO SEARING WHITENESS.Paul blinks as he gradually gets used to the harsh light.
          Slowly the room comes into focus...INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - NIGHTEliot stands over Paul holding a pair of BLOODY SCISSORS.

          material sliced open.PAULWhere am I?101.He talks with difficulty.   His breath labored.ELIOTYou're in a funeral home.(BEAT)You're dead.PAULI'm not dead.
          Jack appears at Eliot's side.ELIOTYou had a car accident. You swerved off

          Paul's glazed eyes widen in shock.PAULI'm not dead.
          Eliot speaks calmly.    Soothingly.ELIOTYour skull was crushed. Your spinal cord

                    dying. Your body's already decomposing.PAULI'm not dead.
          Eliot sighs wearily.    He's had this conversation many
          times before.ELIOTYou people.    You all say the same thing.
          Eliot's voice, with each word, fades further and further
          away. Paul closes his eyes.FADE TO SEARING WHITENESS.PAUL (O.S.)I'm not dead.FADE OUT.
