N O T T I N G   H I L LScreenplay by Richard Curtis--------------------------------------------------------------TitleEXT. VARIOUS DAYS'She' plays through the credits.

  Exquisite footage of Anna Scott -- the great movie star of our
  time -- an ideal -- the perfect star and woman -- her life full of
  glamour and sophistication and mystery.EXT. STREET - DAYMix through to William, 35, relaxed, pleasant, informal.  We
  follow him as he walks down Portobello Road, carrying a load of
  bread.  It is spring.WILLIAM (V.O.)Of course, I've seen her films and
    always thought she was, well,
    fabulous -- but, you know,
    million miles from the world I live
    in.  Which is here -- Notting Hill
    -- not a bad place to be...EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAYIt's a full fruit market day.WILLIAM (V.O.)There's the market on weekdays,
    selling every fruit and vegetable
    known to man...EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAYA man in denims exits the tattoo studio.WILLIAM (V.O.)The tattoo parlour -- with a guy
    outside who got drunk and now can't
    remember why he chose 'I Love Ken'...EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAYWILLIAM (V.O.)The racial hair-dressers where
    everyone comes out looking like the
    Cookie Monster, whether they like
    it or not...

  Sure enough, a girl exits with a huge threaded blue bouffant.EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - SATURDAYWILLIAM (V.O.)Then suddenly it's the weekend, and
    from break of day, hundreds of stalls
    appears out of nowhere, filling
    Portobello Road right up to Notting
    Hill Gate...

  A frantic crowded Portobello market.WILLIAM (V.O.)... and thousands of people buy
    millions of antiques, some genuine...

  The camera finally settles on a stall selling beautiful stained
  glass windows of various sizes, some featuring biblical scenes
  and saints.WILLIAM (V.O.)... and some not so genuine.EXT. GOLBORNE ROAD - DAYWILLIAM (V.O.)And what's great is that lots of
    friends have ended up in this part of
    London -- that's Tony, architect
    turned chef, who recently invested
    all the money he ever earned in a new
    restaurant...

  Shot of Tony proudly setting out a board outside his restaurant,
  the sign still being painted.  He receives and approves a huge
  fresh salmon.EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAYWILLIAM (V.O.)So this is where I spend my days
    and years -- in this small village in
    the middle of a city -- in a house
    with a blue door that my wife and I
    bought together... before she left
    me for a man who looked like Harrison
    Ford, only even handsomer...

  We arrive outside his blue-doored house just off Portobello.WILLIAM (V.O.)... and where I now lead a strange
    half-life with a lodger called...INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - DAYWILLIAMSpike!

  The house has far too many things in it.  Definitely two-
  bachelor flat.

  Spike appears.  An unusual looking fellow.  He has unusual
  hair, unusual facial hair and an unusual Welsh accent: very
  white, as though his flesh has never seen the sun.  He wears
  only shorts.SPIKEEven he.  Hey, you couldn't help me
    with an incredibly important
    decision, could you?WILLIAMThis is important in comparison to,
    let's say, whether they should
    cancel third world debt?SPIKEThat's right -- I'm at last going out
    on a date with the great Janine and I
    just want to be sure I've picked the
    right t-shirt.WILLIAMWhat are the choices?SPIKEWell... wait for it...
      (He pulls on a t-shirt)
    First there's this one...

  The t-shirt is white with a horrible looking plastic alien
  coming out of it, jaws open, blood everywhere.  It says 'I Love
  Blood.'WILLIAMYes -- might make it hard to strike a
    really romantic note.SPIKEPoint taken.

  He heads back up the stairs... talks as he changes...SPIKEI suspect you'll prefer the next one.

  And he re-enters in a white t-shirt, with a large arrow,
  pointing down to his flies, saying, 'Get It Here.'SPIKECool, huh?WILLIAMYes -- she might think you don't have
    true love on your mind.SPIKEWouldn't want that...
      (and back up he goes)
    Okay -- just one more.

  He comes down wearing it.  Lots of hearts, saying, 'You're the
  most beautiful woman in the world.'WILLIAMWell, yes, that's perfect. Well
    done.SPIKEThanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.WILLIAMGood luck.

  Spike turns and walks upstairs proudly.  Revealing that on the
  back of the t-shirt, also printed in big letters, is written
  'Fancy a fuck?'EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAYWILLIAM (V.O.)And so it was just another hopeless
    Wednesday, as I set off through the
    market to work, little suspecting
    that this was the day which would
    change my life forever.  This is
    work, by the way, my little travel
    book shop...

  A small unpretentious store... named 'The Travel Book Co.'WILLIAM (V.O.)... which, well, sells travel books
    -- and, to be frank with you, doesn't
    always sell many of those.

  William enters.INT. THE BOOKSHOP - DAYIt is a small shop, slightly chaotic, bookshelves everywhere,
  with little secret bits round corners with even more books.
  Martin, William's sole employee, is waiting enthusiastically.
  He is very keen, an uncrushable optimist.  Perhaps without
  cause.  A few seconds later, William stands gloomily behind the
  desk.WILLIAMClassic.  Absolutely classic.
    Profit from major sales push -- minus
    £347.MARTINShall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the
    pain.WILLIAMYes, better get me a half.  All I can
    afford.MARINI get your logic.  Demi-capu coming up.

  He salutes and bolts out the door -- as he does, a woman walks in.
  We only just glimpse her.

  Cut to William working.  He looks up casually.  And sees
  something.  His reaction is hard to read.  After a pause...WILLIAMCan I help you?

  It is Anna Scott, the biggest movie star in the world -- here --
  in his shop.  The most divine, subtle, beautiful woman on earth.
  When she speaks she is very self-assured and self-contained.ANNANo, thanks.  I'll just look around.WILLIAMFine.

  She wanders over to a shelf as he watches her -- and picks out a
  quite smart coffee table book.WILLIAMThat book's really not good -- just
    in case, you know, browsing turned to
    buying.  You'd be wasting your money.ANNAReally?WILLIAMYes.  This one though is... very
    good.

  He picks up a book on the counter.WILLIAMI think the man who wrote it has
    actually been to Turkey, which helps.
    There's also a very amusing incident
    with a kebab.ANNAThanks.  I'll think about it.

  William suddenly spies something odd on the small TV monitor
  beside him.WILLIAMIf you could just give me a second.

  Her eyes follow him as he moves toward the back of the shop and
  approaches a man in slightly ill-fitting clothes.WILLIAMExcuse me.THIEFYes.WILLIAMBad news.THIEFWhat?WILLIAMWe've got a security camera in this
    bit of the shop.THIEFSo?WILLIAMSo, I saw you put that book down your
    trousers.THIEFWhat book?WILLIAMThe one down your trousers.THIEFI haven't got a book down my trousers.WILLIAMRight -- well, then we have something
    of an impasse.  I tell you what --
    I'll call the police -- and,  what can
    I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole
    book-down-the-trousers scenario, I
    really apologize.THIEFOkay -- what if I did have a book down
    my trousers?WILLIAMWell, ideally, when I went back to
    the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan
    guide to Bali from your trousers, and
    either wipe it and put it back, or
    buy it.  See you in a sec.

  He returns to his desk.  In the monitor we just glimpse, as does
  William, the book coming out of the trousers and put back on the
  shelves.  The thief drifts out towards the door.  Anna, who has
  observed all this, is looking at a blue book on the counter.WILLIAMSorry about that...ANNANo, that's fine.  I was going to
    steal one myself but now I've changed
    my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.WILLIAMYes, we couldn't stop him.  If you
    can find an unsigned copy, it's
    worth an absolute fortune.

  She smiles.  Suddenly the thief is there.THIEFExcuse me.ANNAYes.THIEFCan I have your autograph?ANNAWhat's your name?THIEFRufus.

  She signs his scruffy piece of paper.  He tries to read it.THIEFWhat does it say?ANNAWell, that's the signature -- and
    above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you
    belong in jail.'THIEFNice one.  Would you like my phone
    number?ANNATempting but... no, thank you.

  Thief leaves.ANNAI think I will try this one.

  She hands William a £20 note and the book he said was rubbish.
  He talks as he handles the transaction.WILLIAMOh -- right -- on second thoughts
    maybe it wasn't that bad.  Actually
    -- it's a sort of masterpiece really.
    None of those childish kebab
    stories you get in so many travel
    books these days.  And I'll throw in
    one of these for free.

  He drops in one of the signed books.WILLIAMVery useful for lighting fires,
    wrapping fish, that sort of things.

  She looks at him with a slight smile.ANNAThanks.

  And leaves.  She's out of his life forever.  William is a little
  dazed.  Seconds later Martin comes back in.MARTINCappuccino as ordered.WILLIAMThanks.  I don't think you'll believe
    who was just in here.MARTINWho?  Someone famous?

  But William's innate natural English discretion takes over.WILLIAMNo. No-one -- no-one.

  They set about drinking their coffees.MARTINWould be exciting if someone famous
    did come into the shop though,
    wouldn't it?  Do you know -- this is
    pretty incredible actually -- I once
    saw Ringo Starr.  Or at least I think
    it was Ringo.  It might have been
    that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,'
    Toppy.WILLIAMTopol.MARTINThat's right -- Topol.WILLIAMBut Ringo Starr doesn't look
    anything like Topol.MARTINNo, well... he was quite a long way
    away.WILLIAMSo it could have been neither of them?MARTINI suppose so.WILLIAMRight.  It's not a classic anecdotes,
    is it?MARTINNot classic, no.

  Martin shakes his head.  William drains his cappuccino.WILLIAMRight -- want another one?MARTINYes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy --
    I'll have an orange juice.EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAYWilliam sets off.INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAYWilliam collects his juice in a coffee shop on Westbourne Park
  Road.EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAYWilliam swings out of the little shop -- he turns the corner of
  Portobello Road and bumps straight into Anna.  The orange
  juice,  in its foam cup, flies.  It soaks Anna.ANNAOh Jesus.WILLIAMHere, let me help.

  He grabs some paper napkins and starts to clean it off -- getting
  far too near her breasts in the panic of it...ANNAWhat are you doing?!

  He jumps back.WILLIAMNothing, nothing... Look, I live just
    over the street -- you could get
    cleaned up.ANNANo thank you.  I need to get my car
    back.WILLIAMI also have a phone.  I'm confident
    that in five minutes we can have you
    spick and span and back on the street
    again... in the non-prostitute sense
    obviously.

  In his diffident way, he is confident, despite her being
  genuinely annoyed.  She turns and looks at him.ANNAOkay.  So what does 'just over the
    street' mean -- give it to me in yards.WILLIAMEighteen yards.  That's my house
    there.

  He doesn't lie -- it is eighteen yards away.  She looks down.
  She looks up at him.INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - CORRIDOR - DAYThey enter.  She carries a few stylish bags.WILLIAMCome on in.  I'll just...

  William runs in further -- it's a mess.  He kicks some old shoes
  under the stairs, bins an unfinished pizza and hides a plate of
  breakfast in a cupboard.  She enters the kitchen.WILLIAMIt's not that tidy, I fear.

  And he guides her up the stairs, after taking the bag of books
  from her...WILLIAMThe bathroom is right at the top of
    the stairs and there's a phone on the
    desk up there.

  She heads upstairs.INT. KITCHEN - DAYWilliam is tidying up frantically.  Then he hears Anna's feet on
  the stairs.  She walks down, wearing a short, sparkling black
  top beneath her leather jacket.  With her trainers still on.  He
  is dazzled by the sight of her.WILLIAMWould you like a cup of tea before
    you go?ANNANo thanks.WILLIAMCoffee?ANNANo.WILLIAMOrange juice -- probably not.

  He moves to his very empty fridge -- and offers its only contents.WILLIAMSomething else cold -- coke, water,
    some disgusting sugary drink
    pretending to have something to do
    with fruits of the forest?ANNAReally, no.WILLIAMWould you like something to nibble --
    apricots, soaked in honey -- quite
    why, no one knows -- because it stops
    them tasting of apricots, and makes
    them taste like honey, and if you
    wanted honey, you'd just buy honey,
    instead of apricots, but nevertheless
    -- there we go -- yours if you want
    them.ANNANo.WILLIAMDo you always say 'no' to everything?

  Pause.  She looks at him deep.ANNANo.
      (pause)
    I better be going.  Thanks for your
    help.WILLIAMYou're welcome and, may I also say...
    heavenly.

  It has taken a lot to get this out loud.  He is not a smooth-
  talking man.WILLIAMTake my one chance to say it.  After
    you've read that terrible book,
    you're certainly not going to be
    coming back to the shop.

  She smiles.  She's cool.ANNAThank you.WILLIAMYes.  Well.  My pleasure.

  He guides her towards the door.WILLIAMNice to meet you.  Surreal but nice.

  In a slightly awkward moment, he shows her out the door.  He
  closes the door and shakes his head in wonder.  Then...WILLIAM'Surreal but nice.'  What was I
    thinking?

  ... He  shakes his head again in horror and wanders back along
  the corridor in silence.  There's a knock on the door.  He moves
  back, casually...WILLIAMComing.

  He opens the door.  It's her.WILLIAMOh hi.  Forget something?ANNAI forgot my bag.WILLIAMOh right.

  He shoots into the kitchen and picks up the forgotten shopping
  bag.  Then returns and hands it to her.WILLIAMHere we go.ANNAThanks.  Well...

  They stand in that corridor -- in that small space.  Second time
  saying goodbye.  A strange feeling of intimacy.  She leans
  forward and she kisses him.  Total silence.  A real sense of the
  strangeness of those lips, those famous lips on his.  They part.WILLIAMI apologize for the 'surreal but nice'
    comment.  Disaster...ANNADon't worry about it.  I thought the
    apricot and honey business was the
    real lowpoint.

  Suddenly there is a clicking of a key in the lock.WILLIAMOh my God.  My flatmate.  I'm sorry --
    there's no excuse for him.

  Spike walks in.SPIKEHi.ANNAHi.WILLIAMHi.

  Spike walks past unsuspiciously and heads into the kitchen.SPIKEI'm just going to go into the kitchen
    to get some food -- and then I'm going
    to tell you a story that will make your
    balls shrink to the size of raisins.

  And leaves them in the corridor.ANNAProbably best not tell anyone about
    this.WILLIAMRight.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell
    myself sometimes but... don't worry
    -- I won't believe it.ANNABye.

  And she leaves, with just a touch of William's hand.  Spike
  comes out of the kitchen, eating something white out of a
  styrofoam container with a spoon.SPIKEThere's something wrong with this
    yogurt.WILLIAMIt's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.SPIKEWell, there you go.
      (takes another big spoonful)
    On for a video fest tonight?  I've
    got some absolute classic.INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHTThe lights are off.  William and Spike on the couch, just the
  light from the TV playing on their faces.  Cut to the TV full
  screen.  There is Anna.  She is in a stylish Woody Allen type
  modern romantic comedy, 'Gramercy Park,' in black and white.INT. MANHATTAN ART GALLERY - DAYAnna's character -- Woody Anna -- is walking around the gallery
  with her famous co-star, Michael.  They should be the perfect
  couple, but there is tension.  Anna is not happy.MICHAELSmile.ANNANo.MICHAELSmile.ANNAI've got nothing to smile about.MICHAELOkay in about 7 seconds, I'm going to
    ask you to marry me.

  And after a couple of seconds -- wow -- she smiles.INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHTSPIKEImagine -- somewhere in the world
    there's a man who's allowed to kiss
    her.WILLIAMYes, she is fairly fabulous.INT. BOOKSHOP - DAYThe next day.  William and Martin quietly co-existing.  An annoy-
  ing customer enters.  Mr. Smith.MR. SMITHDo you have any books by Dickens?WILLIAMNo, we're a travel bookshop.  We only
    sell travel books.MR. SMITHOh right.  How about that new John
    Grisham thriller?WILLIAMNo, that's a novel too.MR. SMITHOh right.  Have you got a copy of
    'Winnie the Pooh'?

  Pause.WILLIAMMartin -- your customer.MARTINCan I help you?

  William looks up.  At that moment the entire window is suddenly
  taken up by the huge side of a bus, obscuring the light -- and
  entirely covered with a portrait of Anna -- from her new film,
  'Helix.'INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - CONDOR/LIVING ROOM - DAYWilliam heads upstairs and pauses.  Spike coming down, wearing
  full body scuba diving gear.SPIKEHey.WILLIAMHi...INT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN - DAYThe two of them fixing a cup of tea in the kitchen.WILLIAMJust incidentally -- why are you
    wearing that?SPIKEAhm -- combination of factors really.
    No clean clothes...WILLIAMThere never will be, you know, unless
    you actually clean your clothes.SPIKERight.  Vicious circle.  And then I was
    like rooting around in your things,
    and found this, and I thought -- cool.
    Kind of spacey.EXT. WILLIAM'S TERRACE - DAYThe two of them on the rooftop terrace, passing the day.
  William is reading 'The bookseller.'  The terrace is small and
  the plants aren't great -- but it overlooks London in a rather
  wonderful way.  Spike still in scuba gear, goggles on.SPIKEThere's something wrong with the
    goggles though...WILLIAMNo, they were prescription, so I could
    see all the fishes properly.SPIKEGroovy.  You should do more of this
    stuff.WILLIAMSo -- any messages?SPIKEYeh, I wrote a couple down.WILLIAMTwo?  That's it?SPIKEYou want me to write down all your
    messages?

  William closes his eyes in exasperation.WILLIAMWho were the ones you didn't write
    down from?SPIKEAhm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone
    completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was --
    one from your mum: she said don't
    forget lunch and her leg's hurting
    again.WILLIAMRight.  No one else?SPIKEAbsolutely not.

  Spike leans back and relaxes.SPIKEThough if we're going for this
    obsessive writing-down-all-messages
    thing -- some American girl called
    Anna called a few days ago.

  William freezes -- then looks at Spike.WILLIAMWhat did she say?SPIKEWell, it was genuinely bizarre...
    she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then
    she said, call me at the Ritz -- and
    then gave herself a completely
    different name.WILLIAMWhich was?SPIKEAbsolutely no idea.  Remembering one
    name's bad enough...INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - DAYWilliam on the phone.  We hear the formal man at the other end of
  the phone.  And then intercut with him.WILLIAMHello.RITZ MAN (V.O.)May I help you, sir?WILLIAMAhm, look this is a very odd
    situation.  I'm a friend of Anna
    Scott's -- and she rang me at home the
    day before yesterday -- and left a
    message saying she's staying with
    you...INT. RITZ RECEPTION - DAYRITZ MANI'm sorry, we don't have anyone of
    that name here, sir.WILLIAMNo, that's right -- I know that.  She
    said she's using another name -- but
    the problem is she left the message
    with my flatmate, which was a serious
    mistake.INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOMWILLIAM (cont'd)
    Imagine if you will the stupidest
    person you've ever met -- are you
    doing that...?

  Spike happens to be in the foreground of this shot.  He's read-
  ing a newspaper.RITZ MANYes, sir.  I have him in my mind.WILLIAMAnd then double it -- and that is the
    -- what can I say -- git I'm living
    with and he cannot remember...SPIKETry 'Flintstone.'WILLIAM(to Spike)
    What?SPIKEI think she said her name was
    'Flintstone.'WILLIAMDoes 'Flintstone' mean anything to
    you?RITZ MANI'll put you right through, sir.

  Flintstone is indeed the magic word.WILLIAMOh my God.

  He practices how to sound.WILLIAMHello.  Hi.  Hi.ANNA (V.O.)Hi.

  We hear her voice -- don't see her.WILLIAM(caught out)
    Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We,
    ahm I work in a bookshop.ANNA (V.O.)You played it pretty cool here,
    waiting for three days to call.WILLIAMNo, I've never played anything cool
    in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll
    stab to death later, never gave me the
    message.ANNA (V.O.)Oh -- Okay.WILLIAMPerhaps I could drop round for tea or
    something?ANNA (V.O.)Yeh -- unfortunately, things are
    going to be pretty busy, but... okay,
    let's give it a try.  Four o'clock
    could be good.WILLIAMRight.  Great.
      (he hangs up)
    Classic.  Classic.EXT. RITZ - DAYWilliam jumps off a bus and walks toward the Ritz.  He carries a
  small bunch of roses.INT. RITZ HOTEL - DAYHe approaches the lifts.  At the lift, he pushes the button and
  the doors open.  As he is getting in, William is joined by a young
  man.  His name is Tarquin.WILLIAMWhich floor?TARQUINThree.

  William pushes the button.  They wait for the doors to close.INT. RITZ CORRIDOR - DAYThe lift lands.  William gets out.  So does Tarquin.  Rooms
  30-35 are to the left.  35-39 to the right.  William heads right.
  So does Tarquin.

  William is puzzled.  He slows down as he approaches room 38.  So
  does Tarquin.  William spots, so does Tarquin.  William points
  at the number.WILLIAMAre you sure you...?TARQUINYes.WILLIAMOh.  Right.

  He knocks.  A bright, well-tailored American girl opens the door.KARENHello, I'm Karen.  Sorry -- things
    are running a bit late.  Here's the
    thing...

  She hands them a very slick, expensively produced press kits,
  with the poster picture of Anna, for the film 'Helix.'INT. THE TRAFALGAR SUITE ANTE-ROOM - DAYA few seconds later -- they enter the main waiting room.  There
  are a number of journalists waiting for their audience.KARENWhat did you think of the film?TARQUINMarvellous.  'Close Encounters'
    meets 'Jean De Florette.'  Oscar-
    winning stuff.

  They both turn to William for his opinion.WILLIAMI agree.KARENI'm sorry.  I didn't get down what
    magazines you're from.TARQUIN'Time Out.'KARENGreat.  And you...WILLIAM(seeing it on a coffee
       table)
    'Horse and Hound.'  The name's
    William Whacker.  I think she might
    be expecting me.KARENOkay -- take a seat.  I'll check.

  They sit down as Karen goes off.TARQUINYou've brought her flowers?

  William goes for the cover-up.WILLIAMNo -- they're... for my grandmother.
    She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought
    I'd kill two birds with one stone.TARQUINI'm sorry.  Which hospital?

  Pause.  He's in trouble.WILLIAMDo you mind me not saying -- it's a
    rather distressing disease and the
    name of the hospital rather gives it
    away.TARQUINOh sure.  Of course.KARENMr. Thacker.

  Saved by the bell.INT. TRAFALGAR SUIT CORRIDOR - DAYKARENYou've got five minutes.

  He is shown in through big golden doors.  Karen stays outside.INT. THE TRAFALGAR SUITE SITTING ROOM - DAYThere Anna is, framed in the window.  Glorious.WILLIAMHi.ANNAHello.WILLIAMI brought these, but clearly...

  There are lots of other flowers in the room.ANNAOh no, ho -- these are great.

  A fair amount of tension.  These two people hardly know each
  other -- and the first and last time they met, they kissed.WILLIAMSorry about not ringing back.  The
    whole two-names concept was totally too
    much for my flatman's pea-sized
    intellect.ANNANo, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I
    always choose a cartoon character --
    last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.

  At which moment Jeremy, Karen's boss, comes in.  A fairly grave,
  authoritative fifty-year-old PR man consulting a list.JEREMYEverything okay?ANNAYes, thanks.JEREMYAnd you are from 'Horse and Hound'
    magazine?

  William nods.ANNAIs that so?

  William shrugs his shoulders.  Jeremy settles at a little desk
  in the corner and makes notes.  A pause.  William feels he has to
  act the part.  They sit in chairs opposite each other.WILLIAMSo I'll just fire away, shall I?

  Anna nods.WILLIAMRight.  Ahm... the film's great...
    and I just wondered -- whether you
    ever thought of having more...
    horses in it?ANNAAhm -- well -- we would have liked to
    -- but it was difficult, obviously,
    being set in space.WILLIAMObviously.  Very difficult.

  Jeremy leaves.

  William puts his head in his hands.  He was panic.WILLIAMI'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they
    thrust this thing into my hand -- I
    didn't know what to do.ANNANo, it's my fault, I thought this
    would all be over by now.  I just
    wanted to sort of apologize for the
    kissing thing.  I seriously don't
    know what got in to me.  I just wanted
    to make sure you were fine about it.WILLIAMAbsolutely fine about it.

  Re-enter Jeremy.JEREMYDo remember that Miss Scott is also
    keen to talk about her next project,
    which is shooting later in the summer.WILLIAMOh yes -- excellent.  Ahm -- any horses
    in that one?  Or hounds, of course.  Our
    readers are equally intrigued by both
    species.ANNAIt takes place on a submarine.WILLIAMYes.  Right... But if there were horses,
    would you be riding them yourself or
    would you be getting a stunt horse person
    double sort of thing?

  Jeremy exits.WILLIAMI'm just a complete moron.  Sorry.
    This is the sort of thing that happens
    in dreams -- not in real life.  Good
    dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to
    see you.ANNAAnd what happens next in the dream?

  It's a challenge.WILLIAMWell, I suppose in the dream dream
    scenario.  I just... ahm, change my
    personality, because you can do that
    in dreams, and  walk across and kiss the
    girl but you know it'll never happen.

  Pause.  Then they move towards each other when... Jeremy
  enters.JEREMYTime's up, I'm afraid.  Sorry it was
    so short.  Did you get what you wanted?WILLIAMVery nearly.JEREMYMaybe time for one last question?WILLIAMRight.

  Jeremy goes out -- it's their last seconds.WILLIAMAre you busy tonight?ANNAYes.

  They look at each other.  Jeremy enters, with another journalists
  in tow.  Anna and William stand and shake hands formally.ANNAWell, it was nice to meet you.
    Surreal but nice.WILLIAMThank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's'
    favorite actress.  You and Black
    Beauty.  Tied.INT. TRAFALGAR SUITE CORRIDOR - DAYWilliam exits fairly despondent and heads for the door.  Tarquin
  is in the corridor calling on his mobile phone.TARQUINHow was she?WILLIAMFabulous.TARQUINWait a minute -- she took your
    grandmother's flowers?

  William can't think his way out of this.WILLIAMYes.  That's right.  Bitch.

  He turns to go, but is accosted by Karen.KARENIf you'd like to come with me we can

    making the film?MALE LEADI did.WILLIAMAny bit in particular?MALE LEADWell, you tell me which bit you liked

    Yes?KARENHave you got a moment?INT. ANNA'S SUITE SITTING ROOM - DAYThey knock on her door.ANNA (V.O.)Come in.

  William enters.  A certain nervousness.  They are alone again.ANNAAhm.  That thing I was doing tonight
    -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told
    them I had to spend the evening with
    Britain's premier equestrian

    I'll, you know, be your date.WILLIAMYou'll be my date at my little sister's
    birthday party?ANNAIf that's all right.WILLIAMI'm sure it's all right.  My friend
    Max is cooking and he's acknowledged
    to be the worst cook in the world, but
    you know, you could hide the food in
    your handbag or something.ANNAOkay.WILLIAMOkay.INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHTBella and Max are in the kitchen.MAXHe's bringing a girl?BELLAMiracles do happen.MAXDoes the girl have a name?BELLAHe wouldn't say.MAXChrist, what is going on in there?

  The oven seems to be smoking a little.  Then the bell rings.

        MAX (cont'd)
      Oh God.

  It's bad timing.  Max shoots out of the kitchen.INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CORRIDOR - NIGHTMax heads for the door impatiently.  He opens it and turns back
  without looking at William and Anna standing there.MAXCome on in.  Vague food crisis.

  William and Anna move along the corridor to the kitchen.INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHTBella is there.BELLAHiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is
    proving more complicated than
    expected.WILLIAMHe's cooking guinea fowl?BELLADon't even ask.ANNAHi.BELLAHi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting
    image of...WILLIAMBella -- this is Anna.BELLARight.

  He rises from his stove position.WILLIAMMax.  This is Anna.MAXHello, Anna ahm...

       word just falls out)
    Scott -- have some wine.ANNAThank you.

  Door bell goes.INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CORRIDOR - NIGHTMax opens the door -- it is Honey.MAXHi.

  She does a little pose, having worn a real party dress.MAXYes, Happy Birthday.

      (sees Anna)
    Oh holy fuck.WILLIAMHun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is
    Honey -- she's my baby sitter.ANNAHiya.HONEYOh God this is one of those key moments
    in life, when it's possible you can be
    really, genuinely cool -- and I'm going
    to fail a hundred percent.  I absolutely
    and totally and utterly adore you and I
    think you're the most beautiful woman
    in the world and more importantly I
    genuinely believe and have believed for
    some time now that we can be best
    friends.  What do you think?ANNAAhm... I think that sounds -- you know
    -- lucky me.  Happy Birthday.

  She hands her a present.HONEYOh my God.  You gave me a present.
    We're best friends already.  Marry
    Will -- he's a really nice guy and
    then we can be sisters.ANNAI'll think about it.

  The front door bell goes.MAXThat'll be Bernie.

  He heads out into the corridor to the front door.INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CORRIDOR - NIGHTMax opens the door.MAXHello, Bernie.BERNIEI'm sorry I'm so late.  Bollocksed up
    at work again, I fear.  Millions down
    the drain.INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHTThey enter the room.MAXBernie -- this is Anna.BERNIEHello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.

  Doesn't recognize her -- turns to Honey.BERNIEHoney Bunny -- happy birthday to you.
      (hands her a present)
    It's a hat.  You don't have to wear
    it or anything.INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHTA minute or two later -- they are standing, drinking wine before
  dinner.  Bernie with Anna on their own -- William helping Max in
  the kitchen.MAXYou haven't slept with her, have you?WILLIAMThat is a cheap question and the answer
    is, of course, no comment.MAX'No comment' means 'yes.'WILLIAMNo, it doesn't.MAXDo you ever masturbate?WILLIAMDefinitely no comment.MAXYou see -- it means 'yes.'

  Then on to Bernie's conversation.BERNIESo tell me Anna -- what do you do?ANNAI'm an actress.BERNIESplendid.  I'm actually in the stock-
    market, so not really similar fields,
    though I have done some amateur stuff
    -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce,
    all that.  'Ooh -- careful there,
    vicar.'  Always imagined it's a
    pretty tough job, though, acting.
    I mean the wages are a scandal,
    aren't they?ANNAWell, they can be.BERNIEI see friends from university --
    clever chaps -- been in the business
    longer than you -- they're scraping
    by on seven, eight thousand a year.
    It's no life.  What sort of acting
    do you do?ANNAFilms mainly.BERNIEOh splendid.  Well done.  How's the
    pay in movies?  I mean, last film you
    did, what did you get paid?ANNAFifteen million dollars.BERNIERight.  Right.  So that's... fairly
    good.  On the high side... have you
    tried the nuts?MAXRight -- I think we're ready.

  They all move towards the kitchen.ANNA(to Bella)
    I wonder if you could tell me where
    the...?BELLAOh, it's just down the corridor on
    the right.HONEYI'll show you.

  A moment's silence as they leave -- then in a split second the
  others all turn to William.BELLAQuickly, quickly -- talk very quickly
    what are you doing here with Anna
    Scott?BERNIEAnna Scott?BELLAYes.BERNIEThe movie star?BELLAYup.BERNIEOh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.

  The horror of his remembered conversation slowly unfolds.
  Honey re-enters.HONEYI don't believe it.  I walked into the
    loo with her.  I was still talking when
    she started unbuttoning her jeans...
    She had to ask me to leave.INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CONSERVATORY - NIGHTA little later.  They are sat at dinner.  Bella next to Anna.BELLAWhat do you think of the guinea fowl?ANNA(whispering)
    I'm a vegetarian.BELLAOh God.INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CONSERVATORY - NIGHTMoving on through the evening -- they are very relaxed, as they
  eat dinner.  A few seconds watching the evening going well -- Anna
  is taking this in -- real friends -- relaxed -- easy, teasing.
  And there's a cake.  Honey wears Bernie's unsuitable hat.  Anna
  watches William laughing at something and then putting his head
  in his hands with mock shame.INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CONSERVATORY - NIGHTCoffee time.MAXHaving you here, Anna, firmly
    establishes what I've long suspected,
    that we really are the most desperate
    hot of under-achievers.BERNIEShame!MAXI'm not saying it's a bad thing, in
    fact, I think it's something we should
    take pride in.  I'm going to give the
    last brownie as a prize to the saddest
    act here.

  A little pause.  Then William turns to Bernie.WILLIAMBernie.BERNIEWell, obviously it's me, isn't it --
    I work in the City in a job I don't
    understand and everyone keeps getting
    promoted above me.  I haven't had a
    girlfriends since... puberty and,
    well, the long and short of it is,
    nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks
    get any chubbier, they never will.HONEYNonsense.  I fancy you.  Or I did
    before you got so far.MAXYou see -- and unless I'm much mistaken,
    your job still pays you rather a lot of
    money, while Honey here, she earns
    nothing flogging her guts out at
    London's seediest record store.HONEYYes.  And I don't have hair -- I've got
    feathers, and I've got funny goggly
    eyes, and I'm attracted to cruel men and
    ... no one'll ever marry me because my
    boosies have actually started
    shrinking.MAXYou see -- incredibly sad.BELLAOn the other hand, her best friend is
    Anna Scott.HONEYThat's true, I can't deny it.  She
    needs me, what can I say?BELLAAnd most of her limbs work.  Whereas
    I'm stuck in its thing day and night,
    in a house full of ramps.  And to add
    insult to serious injury -- I've
    totally given up smoking, my favourite
    thing, and the truth is... we can't
    have a baby.

  Dead silence.WILLIAMBella.

  Bella shrugs her shoulders.  Bernie is totally grief-struck.BERNIENo.  Not true...BELLAC'est la vie... We're lucky in lots
    of ways, but... Surely it's worth a
    brownie.

  William reaches for her hand.  Max breaks the sombre mood.MAXWell, I don't know.  Look at
    William.  Very unsuccessful
    professionally.  Divorced.  Used to
    be handsome, now kind of squidgy
    around the edges -- and absolutely
    certain never to hear from Anna again
    after she's heard that his nickname
    at school was Floppy.

  They all laugh.  Anna smiles across at William.WILLIAMSo I get the brownie?MAXI think you do, yes.ANNAWait a minute.  What about me?MAXI'm sorry?  You think you deserve the
    brownie?ANNAWell... a shot at it.WILLIAMYou'll have to prove it.  This is a
    great brownie and I'm going to fight
    for it.  State your claim.ANNAWell, I've been on a diet since I was
    nineteen, which means basically I've
    been hungry for a decade.  I've had a
    sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one
    of whom hit me: and every time my heart
    gets broken it gets splashed across
    the newspapers as entertainment.
    Meantime, it cost millions to get me
    looking like this...HONEYReally?ANNAReally -- and one day, not long from
    now...

  While she says this, quiet settles around the table.  The thing
  is -- she sort of means it and is opening up to them.ANNA... my looks will go, they'll find out
    I can't act and I'll become a sad
    middle-aged woman who looks a bit like
    someone who was famous for a while.

  Silence... they all look at her... then.MAXNah!!!  Nice try, gorgeous -- but you
    don't fool anyone.

  The mood is instantly broken.  They all laugh.WILLIAMPathetic effort to hog the brownie.INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM/CORRIDOR - NIGHTAnna and William are leaving.ANNAThat was such a great evening.MAXI'm delighted.

  He holds out his hand to shake.  She kisses him on the cheek.
  He stumbles back with joy.ANNAAnd may I say that's a gorgeous tie.MAXNow you're lying.ANNAYou're right.  I told you I was bad
    at acting.

  Max loves this.ANNA(to Bella)
    Lovely to meet you.BELLAAnd you.  I'll wait till you've gone
    before I tell him you're a
    vegetarian.MAXNo!ANNANight, night, Honey.HONEYI'm so sorry about the loo thing.
    I meant to leave but I just...
    look, ring me if you need someone to
    go shopping with.  I know lots of
    nice, cheap places... not that money
    necessarily...
      (gives up)
    nice to meet you.

  And Honey gives her a huge hug.ANNAYou too -- from now on you are my
    style guru.

  Anna and William head out... Bernie tries to save some dignity.BERNIELove your work.

  They move to the door and wave goodbye.EXT. MAX AND BELLA'S HOUSE - NIGHTWilliam and Anna step outside.  From inside they hear a massive
  and hysterical scream of the friends letting out their true
  feelings.  William is a little embarrassed.WILLIAMSorry -- they always do that when I
    leave the house.

  The house is in Lansdowne Road, on the edge of Notting Hill.
  They walk for a moment.  A bit of silence.ANNAFloppy, huh?WILLIAMIt's the hair!  It's to do with the
    hair.ANNAWhy is she in a wheelchair?WILLIAMIt was an accident -- about eighteen
    months ago.ANNAAnd the pregnancy thing -- is that to
    do with the accident?WILLIAMYou know, I'm not sure.  I don't
    think they'd tried for kids before,
    as fate would have it.

  They walk in silence for a moment.  Then...WILLIAMWould you like to come... my house is
    just...?

  She smiles and shakes her head.ANNAToo complicated.WILLIAMThat's fine.ANNABusy tomorrow?WILLIAMI thought you were leaving.ANNAI was.EXT. NOTTING HILL GARDEN - NIGHTA little later in the walk.ANNAWhat's in there?

  They are now walking by a five foot railing, with foliage
  behind it.WILLIAMGardens.  All these streets round
    here have these mysterious communal
    gardens in the middle of them.
    They're like little villages.ANNALet's go in.WILLIAMAh no -- that's the point -- they're
    private villages -- only the people
    who live round the edges are allowed
    in.ANNAYou abide by rules like that?WILLIAMAhm...

  Her look makes it clear that she is waiting with interest on
  the answer to this.WILLIAMHeck no -- other people do -- but not
    me -- I just do what I want.

  He rattles the gate, then starts his climb -- but doesn't quite
  make it, and falls back onto the pavement...WILLIAM(casually)
    Whoopsidaisies.ANNAWhat did you say?WILLIAMNothing.ANNAYes, you did.WILLIAMNo, I didn't.ANNAYou said 'whoopsidaisies.'

  Tiny pause.WILLIAMI don't think so.  No one has said
    'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean
    unless they're...ANNAThere's no 'unless.'  No one has said
    "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and
    even then it was only little girls
    with blonde ringlets.WILLIAMExactly.  Here we go again.

  He fails, and unfortunately, spontaneously...WILLIAMWhoopsidaisies.

  They look at each other.WILLIAMIt's a disease I've got -- it's a
    clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and
    having injections -- it won't last
    long.ANNAStep aside.

  She starts to climb.WILLIAMActually be careful Anna -- it's
    harder than it looks...

  But she's already almost over.WILLIAMOh no it's not -- it's easy.

  A few seconds later.  Anna jumps down into the garden.ANNACome on, Flops.

  William clambers over with terrible difficulty, dusts himself
  off, and heads towards where she stands.WILLIAMNow seriously -- what in the world
    in this garden could make that
    ordeal worthwhile?

  She leans forward -- and, for the firs time since the first
  time -- she kisses him.  This time a proper kiss.  A tiny pause.WILLIAMNice garden.EXT. MAGIC GARDEN - NIGHTThey walk around the garden.  It's a moonlit dream.  We see
  the lights of the houses that surround the garden.  They come
  across a single, simple wooden bench.ANNA'For June, who loved this garden --
    from Joseph who always sat beside
    her.'

  We cut in and see an inscription carved into the wood.  She
  doesn't read the dates, carved below -- 'June Wetherby, 1917
  - 1992.'  She is slightly chocked by it.ANNASome people do spend their whole
    lives together.

  He nods.  They are standing on either side of the bench,
  looking at each other.  The camera glides away from them, up
  into the night sky, leaving them alone in the garden.  Music
  plays.INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - EVENINGWilliam in a towel rushes downstairs, having just had a shower.
  He shoots past Spike.WILLIAMBollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have
    you seen my glasses?SPIKENo, 'fraid not.WILLIAMBollocks.
      (still searching --
       with no help from
       Spike)
    This happens every time I go to the
    cinema.  Average day, my glasses are
    everywhere -- everywhere I look,
    glasses.  But the moment I need them
    they disappear.  It's one of life's
    real cruelties.SPIKEThat's compared to, like,
    earthquakes in the Far East or
    testicular cancer?WILLIAMOh shit, is that the time?  I have to
    go.INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM/CORRIDOR - EVENINGHe sprints downstairs, now fully dressed.WILLIAM(not meaning it)
    Thanks for your help on the glasses
    thing.SPIKE(sincerely)
    You're welcome.  Did you find them?WILLIAMSort of.INT. CINEMA - NIGHTMid-film.  We move across the audience.  And there is in the
  middle of it, we see Anna, watching the screen, and next to
  her, William, watching the film keenly, through his scuba-
  diving goggles.INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHTA very smart Japanese restaurant.  We see Anna and William
  sitting, near the end of their meal.ANNASo who left who?WILLIAMShe left me.ANNAWhy?WILLIAMShe saw through me.ANNAUh-oh.  That's not good.

  We've been aware of the conversation at a nearby table --
  now we can hear it.  Two slightly rowdy men.LAWRENCENo - No- No!  Give me Anna Scott any
    day.

  William and Anna look at each other.GERALDI didn't like that last film of hers.
    Fast asleep from the moment the
    lights went down.

  Again -- Anna reacts.LAWRENCEDon't really care what the films are
    like.  Any film with her in it --
    fine by me.GERALDNo -- not my type at all really.  I
    prefer that other one -- blonde --
    sweet looking -- has an orgasm every
    time you take her out for a cup of
    coffee.

  Anna mouths 'Meg Ryan.'LAWRENCEMeg Ryan.

  William and Anna smile -- they're enjoying it.GERALDDrug-induced, I hear -- I believe
    she's actually in rehab as we speak.LAWRENCEWhatever, she's so clearly up for it.

  Anna's twinkle fades.LAWRENCEYou know -- some girls, they're all
    'stay away chum' but Anna, she's
    absolutely gagging for it.  Do you
    know that in over fifty percent of
    languages the word for "actress" is
    the same as the word for "prostitute."

  This is horrible.LAWRENCEAnd Anna is your definitive actress
    -- someone really filthy you can just
    flip over...WILLIAMRight, that's it.

  He gets up and goes round the corner to the men.  There are in
  fact four of them, the two meeker men, Gavin and Harry, hanging
  on the other guys' witty words.WILLIAMI'm sorry to disturb you guys but --LAWRENCECan I help you?WILLIAMWell, yes, I wish I hadn't overheard
    your conversation -- but I did and I
    just think, you know...

  He's not a very convincing or frightening figure.WILLIAM...the person you're talking about
    is a real person and I think she
    probably deserves a little bit more
    consideration, rather than having
    jerks like you drooling over her...LAWRENCEOh sod off, mate.  What are you, her
    dad?

  Anna suddenly appears at his side and whips him away without
  being recognized.WILLIAMI'm sorry.ANNANo, that's fine.  I love that you
    tried... time was I'd have done the
    same.

  They walk on and then...ANNAIn fact -- give me a second.

  And she walks straight back to their table.ANNAHi.LAWRENCEOh my God...ANNAI'm sorry about my friend -- he's
    very sensitive.LAWRENCENo, look, I'm sorry...ANNAPlease, please -- let's just leave
    it there.  I'm sure you meant no harm,
    and I'm sure it was just friendly
    banter and I'm sure you dicks are all
    the size of peanuts.  A perfect match
    for the size of your brains.  Enjoy
    your meal.  The tuna's really good.

  And she walks away.  Gerald turns to Lawrence.GERALDYou prick.EXT. RITZ ARCADE - NIGHTThey are walking.ANNAI shouldn't have done that.  I
    shouldn't have done that.WILLIAMNo, you were brilliantANNAI'm rash and I'm stupid and what
    am I doing with you?WILLIAMI don't know, I'm afraid.ANNAI don't know either.

  They have arrived at the end of the arcade.ANNAHere we are.
      (pause)
    Do you want to come up?WILLIAM(he hoes)
    There seem to be lots of reasons
    why I shouldn't.ANNAThere are lots of reasons.  Do you
    want to come up?

  His look says yes.ANNAGive me five minutes.

  He watches her go -- and stands in the street.  Music plays.INT. RITZ CORRIDOR/ANNA'S SUITE - NIGHTWilliam coming along the hotel corridor.  He knocks on the
  door.ANNAHiya.

  There's something slightly awry.  He doesn't notice.WILLIAMHi.

  He kisses her gently on the cheek.WILLIAMTo be able to do that is such a
    wonderful thing.ANNA(pause)
    You've got to go.WILLIAMWhy?ANNABecause my boyfriend, who I thought
    was in America, is in fact in the
    next room.WILLIAMYour boyfriend?

  He is duly shocked.  She's trying to be calm.ANNAYes...JEFF (V.O.)Who is it?

  Jeff drifts into view behind.  He is a very famous film star and
  looks the part -- well built, very handsome.  Unshaven, he has
  magic charm, whatever he says.  Over a t-shirt, he wears a
  shirt, which he unbuttons as he talks.WILLIAMAhm... room service.JEFFHow you doing?  I thought you guys

    Spikey -- I'm in contact with some

    What's wrong?

  Spike settles on the arm of a chair.  William decides to open
  up a bit...WILLIAMWell, okay.  There's this girl...SPIKEAha!  I'd been getting a female vibe.
    Good.  Speak on, dear friend.WILLIAMShe's someone I just can't -- someone
    who... self-evidently can't be mine --

  Their looks make it obvious that everyone did.WILLIAMBloody hell, I can't believe it --
    my whole life ruined because I don't

  pause.WILLIAMAnd ahm -- what's a fruitarian exactly?KEZIAHWe believe that fruits and vegetables
    have feelings so we think cooking is
    cruel.  We only eat things that have

      (he looks at them)
    what an unusual situation you have
    here -- to find someone you actually
    love, who'll love you -- the chances

    only loved two girls in my whole life,
    both total disasters.MAXThat's not fair.WILLIAMNo really, one of them marries me and

    well.  So what was a stupid photo-
    shoot now looks like a porno film.
    And well... the pictures have been
    solid and they're everywhere.

  William shakes his head.ANNAI don't know where to go.  The hotel
    is surrounded.WILLIAMThis is the place.ANNAThank you.  I'm just in London for two
    days -- but, with your papers, it's the
    worse place to be.

    has the opportunity to adios the plates
    of a major Hollywood star.  It was a
    thrill for me.
      (she smiles.  Pause)
    How is he?ANNAI don't know.  It got to the point where
    I couldn't remember any of the reasons
    I loved him.  And you... and love?WILLIAMWell, there's a question -- without
    an interesting answer.ANNAI have thought about you.WILLIAMOh no no -- no.

  He doesn't think she has to talk about this.ANNAJust anytime I've tried to keep
    things normal with anyone normal --

    instead?WILLIAMI'm sure you'd be great in Henry James.
    But, you know -- this writer's pretty
    damn good too.ANNAYes -- I mean -- you never get anyone
    in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve
    to say 'inform the Pentagon that we
    need black star cover.'WILLIAMAnd I think the book is the poorer for
    it.

    big feet?WILLIAMNo.  What's that?ANNABig feet -- large shoes.

  He laughs.INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHTA few hours later -- eating ice-cream out of the tub.ANNAThe thing that's so irritating is that
    now I'm so totally fierce when it comes
    to nudity clauses.WILLIAMYou actually have clauses in your
    contact about nudity?ANNADefinitely.  'You may show the dent at

  side of it.  Then gets back in again.

  someone there.WILLIAM(to himself)

  all is.INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - DAYThe morning.WILLIAMIt still strikes me as, well, surreal,

    Particularly breasts -- how can you be so
    interested in them?WILLIAMWell...ANNANo seriously.  I mean, they're just
    breasts.  Every second person in the
    world has got them...WILLIAMMore than that actually, when you think

    nice pair...ANNABut... they're odd-looking.  They're

  way, muttering.SPIKEHow did I look?

    make a buck or two telling the papers
    where I was.

  She's packing.WILLIAMThat's not true.ANNAReally?  The entire British press just
    woke up this morning and thought 'Hey --

    Timbuktu.WILLIAMI know, I know -- but... just -- let's
    stay calm...ANNAYou can stay calm -- it's the perfect
    situation for you -- minimum input,

    bump into will know.  'Well done you --
    you slept with that actress -- we've
    seen the pictures.'WILLIAMThat's spectacularly unfair.ANNAWho knows, it may even help business.

    expensive dinner.  Or holiday --
    depending if he's got the brains to get
    the going rate on betrayal.WILLIAMThat's not true.  And wait a minute...
    this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just
    laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the
    huge sweep of things, this stuff
    doesn't matter.SPIKEWhat he's going to say next is -- there
    are people starving in the Sudan.WILLIAMWell, there are.  And we don't need to
    go anywhere near that far.  My best
    friend slipped -- she slipped down-
    stairs, cracked her back and she's in a
    wheelchair for the rest of her life.
    All I'm asking for is a normal amount
    of perspective.ANNAYou're right: of course, you're right.
    It's just that I've dealt with this
    garbage for ten years now -- you've had
    it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives

    thrown away tomorrow.ANNAYou really don't get it.  This story
    gets filed.  Every time anyone writes
    anything about me -- they'll dig up
    these photos.  Newspapers last forever.
    I'll regret this forever.

  He takes this in.  That's the end.WILLIAMRight.  Fine.  I will do the opposite,
    if it's all right by you -- and always be
    glad you came.  But you're right -- you
    probably better go.

  She looks at him.  The doorbell goes again.  She opens the door.
  Massive noise and photos.  Outside are her people, including
  Karen, a chauffeur, two bodyguards.  And then the door is shut
  and they're all gone.  Silence.INT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN/CORRIDOR - DAYSpike and William sitting there.  Pause.WILLIAMWas it you?SPIKEI suppose I might have told one or two
    people down the pub.WILLIAMRight.

  He puts his head in his hands.  It's over now.EXT. LONDON - DAYAs full, sad music plays -- William begins to walk through
  Notting Hill.

  This walk takes six months... as he walks, the seasons actually
  and magically change, from summer, through autumn and winter,
  back into spring...

  First it is summer -- summer fruits and flowers -- a six-month
  pregnant woman -- Honey with another leather-jacket boyfriend.

  As he walks on the rain starts to fall -- he turns up his coat
  collar -- umbrellas appear.  Followed by winter coats --
  chestnuts roasting -- Christmas trees on sale and the first hint
  of snow.

  Then he comes to Blenheim Crescent, which is startling snowscape,
  for the hundred yard, right across Ladbroke Grove.

  By the time he reaches the purple cafe, the snow is melting and
  in a few yards, it is spring again.  He passes Honey again --
  arguing with her boyfriend, walking away tearful.  Then turns
  past 'the pregnant woman' -- now holding her three-month baby.
  The camera holds on her.INT. BOOKSHOP - DAYA grey day in the bookshop.  Martin and William.  As ever.  A
  feeling that things in there ever change.

  Ten seconds pass.  Honey rushes in.  Spike, still feeling in
  disgrace, comes in with her but lingers in the doorway.HONEYHave we got something for you.
    Something which will make you love me so
    much you'll want to hug me every single
    day for the rest of my life.WILLIAMBlimey.  What's that?HONEYThe phone number of Anna Scott's agent
    in London and her agent in New York.
    You can ring her.  You think about her
    all the time -- now you can ring her!WILLIAMWell, thanks, that's great.HONEYIt is great, isn't it.  See you tonight.
    Hey, Marty-- sexy cardy.

  And she rushes out.  William looks at the piece of paper, folds
  it and then places it gently in the garbage bin.INT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHTBella bangs a spoon on a wine bottle.  All the friends are
  gathered in the restaurant.BELLAI have a little speech to make -- I won't
    stand up because I can't... be bothered.
    Exactly a year ago today, this man here
    started the finest restaurant in London.TONYThank you very much.BELLAUnfortunately -- no one ever came to eat
    here.TONYA tiny hiccough.BELLAAnd so we must face the fact that from
    next week, we have to find somewhere
    near to eat.

  Tony's brave face breaks.  The dream is over.BELLAI just want to say to Tony -- don't take
    it personally.  The more I think about
    things, the more I see no rhyme or reason
    in life -- no one knows why some things
    work out, and some things don't -- why
    some of us get lucky -- and some of us...BERNIE... get fired.BELLANo!BERNIEYes, they're shifting the whole outfit
    much more towards the trading side --
    and of course...
      (he owns up)
    I was total crap.

  They're all rather stunned.TONYSo we go down together!  A toast to
    Bernie -- the worst stockbroker in the
    whole world!

  They toast him.HONEYSince it's an evening of announcements
    ... I've also got one, Ahm... I've
    decided to get engaged.

  Total bewilderment from the others.HONEYI've found myself a nice, slightly odd
    looking bloke who I know is going to
    make me happy for the rest of my life.

  Special cut to Bernie -- the shot shows he had special feelings
  for Honey.WILLIAMWait a minute -- I'm your brother and I
    don't know anything about this.MAXIs it someone we know?HONEYYes.  I will keep you informed.

  As she sits down, Honey leans towards Spike and whispers.HONEYBy the way -- it's you.SPIKEMe?HONEYYes.  What do you think?SPIKEWell, yes.  Groovy.MAXAny more announcements?WILLIAMYes -- I feel I must apologize to
    everyone for my behavior for the last
    six months.  I have, as you know, been
    slightly down in the mouth.MAXThere's an understatement.  There are
    dead people on better form.WILLIAMBut I wish to make it clear I've turned
    a corner and henceforward intend to be
    impressively happy.INT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHTTwo hours later.  They've had a very good time.  There's been a
  chocolate cake.  Lots of alcohol.  Tony is playing 'Blue Moon'
  on the piano, and Bernie joins him, singing.

  At one table Bella and Honey sit -- beer and wine on the table.BELLAI'm really horribly drunk.

  Elsewhere, Max an William are relaxed together.MAXSo -- you've laid the ghost.WILLIAMI believe I have.MAXDon't give a damn about the famous girl.WILLIAMNo, don't think I do.MAXWhich means you won't be distracted by
    the fact that she's back in London,
    grasping her Oscar, and to be found
    filming most days on Hampstead Heath.

  He puts down a copy of the 'Evening Standard' with a picture of
  Anna on its cover.WILLIAM(immediate gloom)
    Oh God no.MAXSo not over her, in fact.EXT. HAMPSTEAD HEATH - DAYCut to the wide sweep of Hampstead Heath.  William entirely
  alone.  He marches up a hill... goes over the crest of it -- and
  sees a huge film crew and hundreds of extras in front of the
  radiant white of Kenwood House, with its lawn and its lakes.EXT. KENWOOD HOUSE - DAYNow closer to the house, William approaches a barrier -- where
  he is himself approached.SECURITYCan I help you?WILLIAMYes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...SECURITYDoes she know you're coming?WILLIAMNo, no.  She doesn't.SECURITYI'm afraid I can't really let you
    through then, sir.WILLIAMOh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm
    not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...SECURITY... can't let you through.

  At that moment -- thirty yards away, William sees trailer door
  open.  Out of it comes Anna -- looking extraordinary -- in a
  velvet dress; full, beautiful make-up; rich, extravagant hair.
  She has a necessary cluster of people about her.  Hair, make-up,
  costume and the third assistant who has collected her.

  She walks a few yards, and then casually turns her head.  And
  sees him.  Her face registers not jut surprise, certainly not a
  simple smile.  His being there is a complicated thing.
  Cut back to him.  He does a small wave.  She pauses as the whole
  paraphernalia of the upcoming scene passes between them.  The
  movie divides them.  But then she begins to walk through it, and
  followed by her cluster, she makes her way towards him.  When
  she reaches him, the security guard stands back a pace, and her
  people hold back.  She doesn't really know what to say...ANNAThis is certainly... ah...WILLIAMI only found out you were here
    yesterday.ANNAI was going to ring... but... I didn't
    think you'd want to...

  The third assistant is under pressure.THIRDAnna.

  She looks around.  The poor third is nervous -- and the first is
  approaching.ANNA(to William)
    It's not going very well -- and it's
    our last day.WILLIAMAbsolutely -- you're clearly very busy.ANNABut... wait... there are things to say.WILLIAMOkay.ANNADrink tea -- there's lots of tea.

  She is swept away, four people touching her hair and costume.KARENCome and have a look...EXT. KENWOOD PARK - DAYAs they make towards the set...KARENAre you a fan of Henry James?WILLIAMThis is Henry James film?EXT. KENWOOD HOUSE - DAYA complicated shot is about to happen -- with waves of extras --
  and a huge moving crane.  They end up next to the sound desk.KARENThis is Harry -- he'll give you a pair of
    headphones so you can hear the dialogue.

  Harry the sound man is a pleasant, fifty-year-old balding
  fellow.  He hands him the headphones.HARRYHere we go.  The volume control is on
    the side.WILLIAMThat's great.

  William, the headphones on, surveys the scene -- the cluster is
  a full 100 yards from the action, to allow a gracious sweeping
  wide-shot.  He watches Anna.  She is with her co-star in the
  Henry James film -- let's call him James.JAMESWe are living in cloudcuckooland --
    we'll never get this done today.ANNAWe have to.  I've got to be in New York
    on Thursday.JAMESOh, stop showing off.

  He studies an actress a few yards to the left.JAMESGod, that's an enormous arse.ANNAI'm not listening.JAMESNo, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so
    many tragic young teenagers with
    anorexia -- and that girl has an arse
    she could perfectly well share round
    with at least ten other women -- and
    still be beg-bottomed.ANNAI said I'm not listening -- and I think,
    looking at something that firm, you and
    your droopy little excuse for an 'arse'
    would be well-advised to keep quiet.

  Back by the desk, William is listening and laughs.  That's his
  girl.  Anna prepares.ANNASo I ask you when you're going to tell
    everyone, and you say...?JAMES'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'ANNAAnd then I... right.JAMESWho was that rather difficult chap you
    were talking to on the way up?ANNAOh... no one... no one.  Just some...
    guy from the past.  I don't know what
    he's doing here.  Bit of an awkward
    situation.EXT. HAMPSTEAD HEATH - DAYCut back to William -- he has heard.WILLIAMOf course.

  He takes off the headphones and puts them gently down.WILLIAMThank you.HARRYAnytime.

  William walks away.  The moment of hope is gone.  He couldn't
  have had a clear reminder.INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - EVENINGWilliam is emptying Anna Scott videos into a box.SPIKEWhat's going on?WILLIAMI'm going to throw out these old videos.SPIKENo.  You can't bin these.  They're
    classics.  I'm not allowing this.WILLIAMRight -- let's talk about rent...SPIKELet me help.  We don't want all this
    shit cluttering up our lives.INT. BACKROOM OF THE BOOKSHOP - DAYThe next day.  William is hard at work, doing the accounts in a
  dark small room with files in it.  Martin pops his head in.MARTINI have to disturb you when you're
    cooking the books, but there's a
    delivery.WILLIAMMartin, can't you just deal with this
    yourself?MARTINBut it's not for the shop.  It's for you.WILLIAMOkay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet
    rag as much as I pay you?

  They head out, Martin behind him, incomprehensively rubbing
  his hands -- he's in a very good mood.INT. BOOKSHOP - DAYWilliam enters -- and there stands Anna -- in a simple blue
  skirt and top.ANNAHi.WILLIAMHello.ANNAYou disappeared.WILLIAMYes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I
    didn't want to disturb you.ANNAWell... how have you been?WILLIAMFine.  Everything much the same.  When
    they change the law Spike and I will
    marry immediately.  Whereas you...
    I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory...ANNAOh no.  It's all nonsense, believe me.
    I had no idea how much nonsense it all
    was -- but nonsense it all is...
      (she's nervous)
    Well, yesterday was our last day
    filming and so I'm just off -- but I
    brought you this from home, and...

  It's quite a big wrapped parcel, flat -- 3 foot by 4 foot,
  leaning against a bookshelf.ANNAI thought I'd give it to you.WILLIAMThank you.  Shall I...ANNANo, don't open it yet -- I'll be
    embarrassed.WILLIAMOkay -- well, thank you.  I don't know
    what it's for.  But thank you anyway.ANNAI actually had it in my apartment in New
    York and just thought you'd... but,
    when it came to it, I didn't know how to
    call you... having behaved so... badly,
    twice.  So it's been just sitting in the
    hotel.  But then... you came, so I
    figured... the thing is... the thing is...WILLIAMWhat's the thing?

  Then the door pings.  In walks the annoying customer, Mr. Smith.WILLIAMDon't even think about it.  Go away
    immediately.

  Mr. Smith is taken aback and therefore completely obedient.MR. SMITHRight.  Sorry.

  And he leaves.WILLIAMYou were saying...ANNAYes.  The thing is... I have to go away
    today but I wondered, if I didn't,
    whether you might let me see you a bit...
    or, a lot maybe... see if you could...
    like me again.

  Pause as William takes this in.WILLIAMBut yesterday... that actor asked you
    who I was... and you just dismissed me
    out of hand... I heard -- you had a
    microphone... I had headphones.ANNAYou expect me to tell the truth about my
    life to the most indiscreet man in
    England?

  Martin edges up.MARTINExcuse me -- it's your mother on the
    phone.WILLIAMCan you tell her I'll ring her back.MARTINI actually tried that tack -- but she
    said you said that before and it's been
    twenty-four hours, and her foot that
    was purple is now a sort of blackish
    color...WILLIAMOkay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold
    the fort for a second will you, Martin?

  Martin is left with Anna.MARTINCan I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a
    wonderful film.ANNAIs that right?MARTINYes... I've always wondered what
    Patrick Swayze is like in real life.ANNAI can't say I know Patrick all that
    well.MARTINOh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the
    filming?ANNAWell, no -- I'm sure he was friendly --
    to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in
    'Ghost.'

  She's kind in here, not sarcastic.MARTINOh right.  Right.  Sorry.  Always been
    a bit of an ass.

  William returns a little uneasy.MARTINAnyway... it's lovely to meet you.  I'm
    a great fan of yours.  And Demi's, of
    course.

  Martin leaves them.WILLIAMSorry about that.ANNAThat's fine.  There's always a pause
    when the jury goes out to consider its
    verdict.

  She's awaiting an answer.WILLIAMAnna.  Look -- I'm a fairly level-
    headed bloke.  Not often in and out of
    love.  But...

  He can't really express what he feels.WILLIAM... can I just say 'no' to your kind
    request and leave it at that?ANNA... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I...
    you know... of course... I'll just...
    be getting along then... nice to see
    you.WILLIAMThe truth is...

  He feels he must explain.WILLIAM... with you, I'm in real danger.  It
    took like a perfect situation, apart
    from that foul temper of yours -- but my
    relatively inexperienced heart would,
    I fear, not recover if I was once again
    ... cast aside, which I would
    absolutely expect to be.  There are too
    many pictures of you everywhere, too
    many films.  You'd go and I'd be...
    well, buggered, basically.ANNAI see.
      (pause)
    That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?WILLIAMI live in Notting Hill.  You live in
    Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world
    knows who you are.  My mother has
    trouble remembering my name.ANNAOkay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.

  Pause.ANNAThe fame thing isn't really real, you
    know.  Don't forget -- I'm also just a
    girl.  Standing in front of a boy.
    Asking him to love her.

  Pause.  She kisses him on the cheek.ANNABye.

  Then turns and leaves.  Leaving him.INT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - DAYThe restaurant is in the middle of being deconstructed.  The
  pictures are gone off the walls -- a kettle on a long extension
  lead is on the bare table behind.  They're all sitting there.WILLIAMWhat do you think?  Good move?HONEYGood move: when all is said and done,
    she's nothing special.  I saw her
    taking her pants off and I definitely
    glimpsed some cellulite down there.BELLAGood decision.  All actresses are mad
    as snakes.WILLIAMTony -- what do you think?TONYNever met her, never want to.WILLIAMBrilliant.  Max?MAXAbsolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.WILLIAMGreat.  Excellent.  Thanks.

  Spike enters.SPIKEI was called and I came.  What's up?HONEYWilliam has just turned down Anna Scott.SPIKEYou daft prick!

  Bella is casually looking at the painting that sits beside
  William.  It is the original of the Chagall, the poster of which
  was on his wall.BELLAThis painting isn't the original, is
    it?WILLIAMYes, I think that one may be.BERNIEBut she said she wanted to go out with
    you?WILLIAMYes -- sort of...BERNIEThat's nice.WILLIAMWhat?BERNIEWell, you know, anybody saying they
    want to go out with you is... pretty
    great... isn't it...WILLIAMIt was sort of sweet actually -- I mean,
    I know she's an actress and all that, so
    she can deliver a line -- but she said
    that she might be as famous as can be --
    but also... that she was just a girl,
    standing in front of a boy, asking him
    to love her.

  They take in the line.  It totally reverses their attitudes.
  A pause.WILLIAMOh sod a dog.  I've made the wrong
    decision, haven't I?

  They look at him.  Spike does a big nod.WILLIAMMax, how fast is your car?EXT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - DAYMax's car arrives in the street outside.  They pile into the
  car.MAXIf anyone gets in our way -- we have
    small nuclear devices.BERNIEAnd we intend to use them!MAXWhere's Bella?HONEYShe's not coming.MAXSod that.  Bernie -- in the back!

  He shoots out of his door, rushes round and grabs Bella out of
  the chair.MAXCome on, babe.EXT./INT. CAR. STANLEY CRESCENT/NOTTING HILL GATE - DAYMax's car is shooting up Stanley Crescent.  We are inside and
  outside the car.BELLAWhere are you going?MAXDown Kensington Church Street, then
    Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.BELLACrazy.  Go along Bayswater...HONEYThat's right -- then Park Lane.BERNIEOr you could go right down to Cromwell

  Suddenly the car slams to a halt.MAXStop right there!  I will decide the
    route.  All right?ALLAll right.MAXJames Bond never has to put up with this
    sort of shit.EXT. PICCADILLY - DAYThe car turns illegally right across Piccadilly the wrong way
  down a one-way street and ends up outside the Ritz.  William
  sprints into the hotel.  Bernie follows.BERNIEBloody hell, this is fun.IT. RITZ LOBBY - DAYWILLIAMIs Miss Scott staying here?

  It is the same man.RITZ MANNo, sir.WILLIAMHow about Miss Flintstone?RITZ MANNo, sir.WILLIAMOr Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or
    Butthead?

  Man shakes his head.RITZ MANNo, sir.WILLIAMRight.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.

  He turns despondent and takes two steps when the Ritz Man stops
  him in his tracks.RITZ MANThere was a Miss Pocahontas in room 126
    -- but she checked out an hour ago.  I
    believe she's holding a press
    conference at The Savoy before flying to
    America.

  William is very grateful.  He kisses the Ritz Man.  Bernie's also
  gratuful.  He kisses him too.BERNIEWe have lift off!!

  A Japanese guest assumes this is the way to behave and the Ritz
  Man gets kissed a third time.EXT. LONDON STREET - DAYThe car speeds through London.  It gets totally stuck at a
  junction where no one will let them in.SPIKEBugger this for a bunch of bananas.

  He gets out of the car and boldly stops the traffic coming in the
  opposite direction.  Our car shoots past him.SPIKEGo!

  They leave him behind.  Honey leans out the window and shouts...HONEYYou're my hero.

  Spike waves wildly -- he loses concentration and is very nearly
  hit by a car.EXT. THE SAVOY - DAYThey pull to a stop.  William leaps out.MAXGo!INT. THE SAVOY - DAYWilliam rushes up to the main desk.WILLIAMExcuse me, where's the press
    conference?MAN AT SAVOYAre you an accredited member of the

    Run!INT. SAVOR ROOM - DAYWilliam runs, searching.  At last finds the room, and enters.INT. LANCASTER ROOM - DAYHuge room -- full of press.  Row after row of journalists,
  cameras at the front, TV cameras at the back.  Anna clearly
  gives press conferences very rarely, because this one is
  positively presidential.  She sits at a table at the end of the
  room, beside Karen: on her other side is Jeremy, the PR boss,
  firmly marshalling the questions.JEREMYYes... You -- Dominic.QUESTIONER 1How much longer are you staying in the
    UK then?ANNANo time at all.  I fly out tonight.

  She's in a slightly melancholic and therefore honest mood.JEREMYWhich is why we have to round it up now.
    Final questions.

  He points at a journalist he knows.QUESTIONER  2Is your decision to take a year off
    anything to do with the rumours about
    Jeff and his present leading lady?ANNAAbsolutely not.QUESTIONER 2Do you believe the rumours?ANNAIt's really not my business any more.
    Though I will say, from my experience,
    that rumours about Jeff... do tend to
    be true.

  They love that answer, and all scribble in their note books.
  Next question comes from someone straight right next to
  William.QUESTIONER 3Last time you were here, there were some
    fairly graphic photographs of you and a
    young English guy -- so what happened
    there?ANNAHe was just a friend -- I think we're
    still friends.JEREMYYes, the gentleman in the pink shirt.

  He is pointing straight at William, who has his hand up.WILLIAMYes -- Miss Scott -- are there any
    circumstances in which you two might be
    more than just friends?

  Anna sees who it is asking.ANNAI hoped there might be -- but no, I'm
    assured there aren't.WILLIAMAnd what would you say...JEREMYNo, it's just one question per person.ANNANo, let him... ask away.  You were
    saying?WILLIAMYes, I just wondered whether if it
    turned out that this... person...OTHER JOURNALIST(to William)
    His name is Thacker.WILLIAMThanks.  I just wondered if Mr. Thacker
    realized he'd been a daft prick and got
    down on his knees and begged you to
    reconsider, whether you would...
    reconsider.

  We cut to Max, Bella, Bernie and Honey, all watching.  Then back
  to Anna.ANNAYes, I'm pretty sure I would.WILLIAMThat's very good news.  The readers of
    'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely
    delighted.

  Anna whispers something to Jeremy.JEREMYDominic -- if you'd like to ask your
    question again?QUESTIONER 1Yes -- Anna -- how long are you
    intending to stay here in Britain?

  Pause.  Anna looks up at William.  He nods.ANNAIndefinitely.

  They both smile -- suddenly the press gets what's going on --
  music -- noise -- they all turn and flash, flash, flash photos
  of William.  Max and Bella kiss.  Bernie kisses a total stranger.
  Spike finally makes it -- he's bright red from running.SPIKEWhat happened?HONEYIt was good.

  Honey hugs him.  It's a new experience for Spike.

  Cut to William's face -- flash after flash -- still looking at
  Anna.  They are both smiling.INT./EXT. THE HEMPEL ZEN GARDEN WITH MARQUEEN - DAYAnna and William at their wedding -- they kiss and walk into the
  crowd.

  Honey, a bridesmaid in peach satin -- she is surrounded by at
  least four other bridesmaids, all under five.

  Nearby, Tony standing, glowing, beside his fabulous,
  pyramidical wedding cake.

  William's mother is not quite happy with how he's looking.  She
  tries to brush his hair.

  Max, dressed in the most devastating Bond-like white tuxedo is
  dancing with Anna -- thrilled.  He does a rather flashy little
  move.  Cut to Bella who is watching and laughing.

  Martin, in an awkward tweed suit, is jiggling to the beat of a
  song, entirely happy in the corner.EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE - NIGHTA huge premier -- screaming crowds -- Anna and William get out
  of the car, she holding his hand --  looking ultimately gorgeous
  -- he in a black tie that doesn't quite fit.  He's startled.EXT. GARDEN - DAYA pretty green communal garden.  Children are playing, watched
  by mothers, one of whom holds a new baby in a papoose.  A very
  old couple wander along slowly.

  A small tai chi group moves mysteriously.  And as the camera
  glides, it passes a couple sitting on a single, simple wooden
  bench overlooking the garden.  He is reading, she is just
  looking out, totally relaxed, holding his hand, pregnant.  It
  is William and Anna.THE END--------------------------------------------------------------
