That's theopposite of the force we studiedyesterday, which was...VOICE IN THE CROWDMagnum force.Hoots and laughter.TREVORCentrifugal force... Centripetalforce is where the acceleration ofa body moving in circular motionis directed toward its center by anopposing force, thus creatingmomentum that constrains the body toits circular path.

A silent, paroxysmalterror registers on his face.In a parabolic mirror, the blurred image of DennisBroadway, pushing hard toward a conclusion now.BACK TO SPEED as Dennis explodes forward, body blockingTrevor from behind, pinning him against a wall andsending the "187" textbook flying.He rams his weapon into Trevor's back.In a SERIES OF RAPID-FIRE CUTS, filtered sunlightshimmers off the sharpened nail as it slashes downward.A barrage of stabbing motions, tearing at cloth andflesh. Trevor's backward flailing arms are ineffectivein blocking the frenzied stabfest. Downward slashing,again and again... 10 times.Aftermath. As quickly as it began it's over. DennisBroadway slams open an exit door and is gone. Studentsscatter like cockroaches. An eerie stillness lingers.Trevor Garfield is lying on his back now in a pool ofblood; black plastic framed glasses in pieces on thefloor; lifeless arms spread out at his sides.
