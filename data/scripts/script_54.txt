                      Screenplay by Dan O'Bannon1976SYNOPSISEn route back to Earth from a far part of the galaxy, the crew of the
     starship SNARK intercepts a transmission in analien language,
     originating from a nearby storm-shrouded planet.

     Mankind has waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent
     life in the universe -- they decide to land and investigate.  Their
     search takes them to a wrecked alien spacecraft whose doors gape open
     -- it is dead and abandoned.  Inside they find, among other strange
     things, the skeleton of one of the unearthly space travellers.

     Certain clues in the wrecked ship lead them across the hostile surface
     of the planet to a primitive stone pyramid, the only remnant of a
     vanished civilization.  Beneath this pyramid they find an ancient tomb
     full of fantastic artifacts.  Lying dormant in the tomb are centuries-
     old spores, which are triggered into life by the men's presence.  A
     parasite emerges and fastens itself to one of the men's faces -- and
     cannot be removed.

     An examination by the ship's medical computer reveals that the
     creature has inserted a tube down his throat, which is depositing
     something inside him.  Then it is discovered that the parasite's blood
     is a horribly corrosive acid which eats through metal -- they dare not
     kill it on the ship.

     Ultimately it is dislodged from its victim and ejected from the ship,
     and they blast off from the Hell-planet.  However, before they can seal
     themselves into suspended animation for the long voyage home, a
     horrible little monster emerges from the victim's body -- it has been
     growing in him, deposited there by the parasite... and now it is loose
     on the ship.

     A series of ghastly adventures follow.  They trap it in an air shaft
     and a man has to crawl down the shaft with a flamethrower -- it tears
     a man's head off and runs away with his body -- a man is crushed in
     the air lock door and the ship loses most of its air in a terrific
     windstorm -- another man is burned to death and then eaten by the
     creature -- and another is woven into a cocoon as part of the alien's
     bizarre life cycle.

     Finally there is only one man left alive, alone on the ship with the
     creature, and only six hours till his air runs out; which leads to a
     climax of horrifying, explosive jeopardy, the outcome of which
     determines who will reach Earth alive -- man or alien.CAST OF CHARACTERSCHAZ STANDARD,Captain.................A leader and a politician.  Believes that
                                   any action is better than no action.MARTIN ROBY,Executive Officer.......Cautious but intelligent -- a survivor.DELL BROUSSARD,Navigator...............Adventurer; brash glory-hound.SANDY MELKONIS,Communications..........Tech Intellectual; a romantic.CLEAVE HUNTER,Mining Engineer.........High-strung; came along to make his

     The crew is unisex and all parts are interchangeable for men or women.FADE IN:

     EXTREME CLOSEUPS OF FLICKERING INSTRUMENT PANELS.  Readouts and digital
     displays pulse eerily with the technology of the distant future.

     Wherever we are, it seems to be chill, dark, and sterile.  Electronic
     machinery chuckles softly to itself.

     Abruptly we hear a BEEPING SIGNAL, and the machinery begins to awaken.
     Circuits close, lights blink on.

     CAMERA ANGLES GRADUALLY WIDEN, revealing more and more of the
     machinery, banks of panels, fluttering gauges, until we reveal:INTERIOR - HYPERSLEEP VAULTA stainless steel room with no windows, the walls packed with
     instrumentation.  The lights are dim and the air is frigid.

     Occupying most of the floor space are rows of horizontal FREEZER
     COMPARTMENTS, looking for all the world like meat lockers.

     FOOM!  FOOM!  FOOM!  With explosions of escaping gas, the lids on the
     freezers pop open.

     Slowly, groggily, six nude men sit up.ROBYOh... God... am I cold...BROUSSARDIs that you, Roby?ROBYI feel like shit...BROUSSARDYeah, it's you all right.

     Now they are yawning, stretching, and shivering.FAUST(groans)
               Ohh... I must be alive, I feel dead.BROUSSARDYou look dead.MELKONISThe vampires rise from their graves.

     This draws a few woozy chuckles.BROUSSARD(shakes his fist in the
                     air triumphantly)
               We made it!HUNTER(not fully awake)
               Is it over?STANDARDIt's over, Hunter.HUNTER(yawning)
               Boy, that's terrific.STANDARD(looking around with a grin)
               Well, how does it feel to be rich
               men?FAUSTCold!

     This draws a LAUGH.STANDARDOkay!  Everybody topside!  Let's get
               our pants on and get to our posts!

     The men begin to swing out of the freezers.MELKONISSomebody get the cat.

     Roby picks a limp cat out of a freezer.INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOMThis is a fantastic circular room, jammed with instrumentation.  There
     are no windows, but above head level the room is ringed by
     viewscreens, all blank for the moment.

     There are seats for four men.  Each chair faces a console and is
     surrounded by a dazzling array of technology.

     STANDARD, ROBY, BROUSSARD, and MELKONIS are entering and finding their
     seats.BROUSSARDI'm going to buy a cattle ranch.ROBY(putting down the cat)
               Cattle ranch!BROUSSARDI'm not kidding.  You can get one if
               you have the credit.  Look just like
               real cows, too.STANDARDAll right, tycoons, let's stop
               spending our credit and start
               worrying about the job at hand.ROBYRight.  Fire up all systems.

     They begin to throw switches, lighting up their consoles.  The control
     room starts to come to life.  All around the room, colored lights
     flicker and chase each other across glowing screens.  The room fills
     with the hum and chatter of machinery.STANDARDSandy, you want to give us some
               vision?MELKONISFeast your eyes.

     Melkonis reaches to his console and presses a bank of switches.  The
     strip of viewscreens flickers into life.

     On each screen, we see BLACKNESS SPECKLED WITH STARS.BROUSSARD(after a pause)
               Where's Irth?STANDARDSandy, scan the whole sky.

     Melkonis hits buttons.  On the screens the images all begin to pan.

     CAMERA MOVES IN ON ONE OF THE SCREENS, with its moving image of a
     starfield.EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACECLOSE SHOT OF A PANNING TV CAMERA.  This camera is remote controlled,
     turning silently on its base.

     CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL BACK, revealing that the TV camera is mounted on
     the HULL OF SOME KIND OF CRAFT.

     When the pullback is finished, WE SEE THE FULL LENGTH OF THE STARSHIP
     "SNARK," hanging in the depths of interstellar space, against a
     background of glimmering stars.INTERIOR - BRIDGEROBYWhere are we?STANDARDSandy, contact traffic control.

     Melkonis switches on his radio unit.MELKONISThis is deep space commercial vessel
               SNARK, registration number E180246,
               calling Antarctica air traffic
               control.  Do you read me?  Over.

     There is only the HISS OF STATIC.BROUSSARD(staring at a screen)
               I don't recognize that constellation.STANDARDDell, plot our location.

     Broussard goes into action, punching buttons, lighting up all his
     instruments.BROUSSARDI got it.  Oh boy.STANDARDWhere the hell are we?BROUSSARDJust short of Zeta II Reticuli.  We
               haven't even reached the outer rim
               yet.ROBYWhat the hell?

     Standard picks up a microphone.STANDARDThis is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we
               are not home.  Our present location
               seems to be only halfway to Irth.
               Remain at your posts and stand by.
               That is all.ROBYChaz, I've got something here on my
               security alert.  A high priority from
               the computer...STANDARDLet's hear it.ROBY(punches buttons)
               Computer, you have signalled a
               priority three message.  What is the
               message?COMPUTER(a mechanical voice)
               I have interrupted the course of the
               voyage.ROBYWhat?Why?COMPUTERI am programmed to do so if certain
               conditions arise.STANDARDComputer, this is Captain Standard.
               What conditions are you talking
               about?COMPUTERI have intercepted a transmission of
               unknown origin.STANDARDA transmission?COMPUTERA voice transmission.MELKONISOut here?

     The men exchange glances.COMPUTERI have recorded the transmission.STANDARDPlay it for us, please.

     Over the speakers, we hear a hum, a crackle, static...THEN ASTRANGE, UNEARTHLY VOICE FILLS THE ROOM, SPEAKING AN ALIENLANGUAGE.  The bizarre voice speaks a long sentence, then falls
     silent.

     The men all stare at each other in amazement.STANDARDComputer, what language was that?COMPUTERUnknown.ROBYUnknown!  What do you mean?COMPUTERIt is none of the 678 dialects
               spoken by technological man.

     There is a pause, then EVERYBODY STARTS TALKING AT THE SAME TIME.STANDARD(silencing them)
               Justhold it,hold it!
                    (glares around the room)
               Computer: have you attempted to
               analyze the transmission?COMPUTERYes.  There are two points of salient
               interest.  Number one: it is highly
               systematized, indicating intelligent
               origin.  Number two: certain sounds
               are inconsistent with the human
               palate.ROBYOh my God.STANDARDWell, it's finally happened.MELKONISFirst contact...STANDARDSandy, can you home in on that beam?MELKONISWhat's the frequency?STANDARDComputer, what's the frequency of
               the transmission?COMPUTER65330 dash 99.

     Melkonis punches buttons.MELKONISI've got it.  It's coming from
               ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds,
               declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.STANDARDDell -- show me that on a screen.BROUSSARDI'll give it to you on number four.

     Broussard punches buttons.  One of the viewscreens flickers, and a
     small dot of light becomes visible in the corner of the screen.BROUSSARD (CONT'D)That's it.  Let me straighten it out.

     He twists a knob, moving the image on the screen till the dot is in
     the center.STANDARDCan you get it a little closer?BROUSSARDThat's what I'm going to do.

     He hits a button.  The screen flashes and a PLANET APPEARS.BROUSSARD (CONT'D)Planetoid.  Diameter, 120 kilometers.MELKONISIt's tiny!STANDARDAny rotation?BROUSSARDYeah.  Two hours.STANDARDGravity?BROUSSARDPoint eight six.  We can walk on it.

     Standard rises.STANDARDMartin, get the others up to the
               lounge.INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOMThe entire crew -- STANDARD, ROBY, BROUSSARD, MELKONIS, HUNTER, and
     FAUST -- are all seated around a table, with Standard at the head.MELKONISIf it's an S.O.S., we're morally
               obligated to investigate.BROUSSARDRight.HUNTERI don't know.  Seems to me we came on
               this trip to make some credit, not
               to go off on some kind of side trip.BROUSSARD(excited)
               Forget the credit; what we have here
               is a chance to be thefirst mento
               contact anonhuman intelligence.ROBYIf there is some kind of alien
               intelligence down on that planetoid,
               it'd be a serious mistake for us to
               blunder in unequipped.BROUSSARDHell, we're equipped --ROBYHell, no!  We don't know what's down
               there on that piece of rock!  It
               might be dangerous!  What we should
               do is get on the radio to the
               exploration authorities... and let
               them deal with it.STANDARDExcept it will take 75 years to get
               a reply back.  Don't forget how far
               we are from the Colonies, Martin.BROUSSARDThere are no commercial lanes out
               here.  Face it, we're out of range.MELKONISMen have waited centuries to contact
               another form of intelligent life in
               the universe.  This is an opportunity
               which may never come again.ROBYLook --STANDARDYou're overruled, Martin.  Gentlemen
               -- let's go.INTERIOR - BRIDGEThe men are strapping in, but this time it is with grim determination.STANDARDDell, I want greater magnification.
               More surface detail.  I want to see
               what this place looks like.BROUSSARDI'll see what I can do.

     He jabs his controls.  The image on the screen ZOOMS DOWN TOWARD THE
     PLANET; but all detail quickly vanishes into a featureless grey haze.STANDARDIt's out of focus.ROBYNo -- that's atmosphere.  Cloud
               layer.MELKONISMy God, it's stormy for a piece of
               rock that size!ROBYJust a second.

               directly above the source of the
               transmission.STANDARDWhat's the terrain down there?BROUSSARDWell, line of sight is impossible
               due to dust.  Radar gives me noise.

     Standard, Broussard and Melkonis appear silhouetted against the
     doorway.  They switch on flashlight-like devices called "DATASTICKS",
     and step in.Carefully, peering around, they pick their way past the indistinct
     machinery.MELKONISAir lock?STANDARDWho knows?BROUSSARDLet's try and find the control room.

     As they move their lights around, they can see that the walls,
     ceiling, and machinery are FULL OF HUGE, IRREGULAR HOLES.MELKONISLook at these holes.  This place
               looks like Swiss cheese.

     Broussard shines his light up into a huge hole in the ceiling.BROUSSARDThis hole goes up several decks --

     Standard draws out a stubby spear gun with a graplon attached to it.
     He aims it up into the hole and fires.

     The graplon is launched up into darkness, trailing a thin wire.  There
     is a dull CLUNK, and the wire dangles.BROUSSARDI'll go first.STANDARDNo, you'll follow me.

     Standard attaches the wire to a powered gear box on his chest, and
     presses a button.  With a mechanical whine, he is pulled up into the
     hole, using his feet for leverage where he can.

     Broussard attaches the wire to his own chest unit.INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM OF ALIEN SHIPThis chamber is totally dark as Broussard arrives at the top of the
     hole.

     Standard stands with his flashlight/camera ("datastick") tracing a
     beam through the hanging dust.

     Broussard unclips himself from the climbing wire, then raises his own
     light.  At that moment, Melkonis arrives at the top of the hole.

     THEIR LIGHTS SCAN THE ROOM.  The beams are clearly visible as columns
     of light in the floating dust.  They reveal heavy, odd shapes.

     Broussard stumbles over something.  He shines his light down on it.

     It is a large, glossy urn, brown in color, with peculiar markings.
     Broussard stands it upright.  It has a round opening in the top, and is
     empty.

     Suddenly, Melkonis lets out a grunt of shock.  Their lights have
     illuminated something unspeakably grotesque: A HUGE ALIEN SKELETON,SEATED IN THE CONTROL CHAIR.They approach the skeleton, their lights trained on it.  IT IS AGROTESQUE THING, BEARING NO RESEMBLANCE TO THE HUMAN FORM.MELKONISHoly Christ...

     Traced raggedly onto the surface of the panel, as by the point of a
     sharp instrument, is a small triangle:Hearing something, Broussard flashes his light across the room.  As the
     beam scans the walls, it briefly touches on SOMETHING THAT MOVES.

     Melkonis convulsively yanks out his pistol.MELKONISLOOK OUT, IT MOVED!

     Standard knocks his hand down.STANDARDKeep away from that gun!

     Standard shoulders himself in front of the others.  Then, slowly, he
     begins to move toward the far side of the room.

     They approach a console on the wall, training their lights on it.
     There is a machine.  On the machine, a small bar moves steadily back

     Broussard has rigged a tripod across the mouth of the hole.  He
     unspools a couple feet of wire from the device, and attaches the end
     of it to his chest unit.

     He climbs over the lip and drops into the hole.  He is now hanging by
     the wire, with his head and shoulders out of the hole.BROUSSARD (CONT'D)Okay, I'm in the mouth of the

               air rising from below.

     He starts down, paying out the line and moving down in short hops,
     pushing off each time with his feet.

     He stops to catch his breath.  His breathing rasps loudly in his
     helmet.

     A little sunlight filters down from above.  Looking up, he can see the
     mouth of the hole, a glowing spot of light.

     begins to lower himself on power.  Now he is dangling free in darkness,

     his balance.INTERIOR - TOMB - DAYBroussard is standing on a dusty stone floor, with a feeble column of
     sunlight shining down around him from the tunnel above.  Around is
     solid darkness.

     He flashes his datastick around.  The beam reveals that he is in a
     stone room.  STRANGE HEIROGLYPHICS are carved into the walls.  They have
     a primitive, religious appearance.  Row after row of pictograms stretch
     from floor to ceiling, some epic history in an unknown language.  Huge
     religious symbols dominate one wall.

     shines his light on one of them; then he lays his gloved hand on it.

     He lifts his mask radio to his lips.BROUSSARDI don't know if you can hear me, but
               the place is full of large bottles

               are all sealed.  Also they're soft to
               the touch.

     He pauses to quickly change the film clip in his datastick; then he
     turns back to the "urn" he was examining -- BUT NOW THERE IS A HOLE INTHE TOP OF IT.He shines his light on the floor at the base of the "urn."  There lies
     the "lid" -- the stopper that had filled the hole.  He picks it up and
     studies it.  It appears more organic than artificial; the inside
     surface is spongy and irregular.

     Then he turns the light to the now-open "urn."

     He bends over the mouth of the "urn" shining the light in, AND WITHSHOCKING VIOLENCE, A SMALL, OCTOPUS-LIKE THING LEAPS OUT AND ATTACHESITSELF TO HIS FACE, WRAPPING ITS TENTACLES AROUND HIS HEAD.With a MUFFLED SCREAM, he launches himself backward, tearing at the

               minutes.  It's been much longer.
               Let's get him out of there.

     Standard pulls himself up and crouches precariously on the edge of the
     tunnel.  He begins to fiddle with the winch mechanism from which
     Broussard's line dangles.STANDARD (CONT'D)The line's slack.  Christ, do you
               think the idiot unhooked himself?

     He switches on the winch motor.  With a whine, it begins to reel the
     line in.  After a moment, the line TIGHTENS WITH A JERK -- and the
     motor slows down, laboring under the added weight.STANDARD (CONT'D)There, it caught!MELKONISIs it still coming up, or is it
               hooked on something?STANDARDNo, it's coming.MELKONISCan you see anything?

     Standard shines his light down into the hole.STANDARDNo, I can't see far enough.  The
               line's moving, though.

     For a moment, the two men hang to the narrow top of the pyramid,
     saving their strength, while the line reels in and the wind howls.

     Broussard appears at the top of the pit, dangling limply from the

     Melkonis attempts to come to his aid.MELKONISWhat is it?STANDARDDon't touch him, watch it!

     In their panic and confusion, the men teeter momentarily, finally
     regain their balance.  They shine their lights on Broussard.

     which rests in a cradle and slides in and out of a slot in the wall.STANDARDHelp me, come on, let's get him up

     They slide the man onto the bunk.HUNTERThat thing, God almighty, didn't you

     Standard yanks off his gloves.STANDARD (CONT'D)Medical gloves.

     They pull thin elastic gloves from a dispenser in the wall, and pull
     them on.

     Gingerly, they approach Broussard.

     Standard places his hands on the octopus-thing that is slowly pulsing
     on Broussard's face.  He grasps the tentacles in his hands and tries to
     pull it free.STANDARD (CONT'D)It's really on there tight.FAUSTHere, let me try.

     Faust takes a pair of pliers from a rack, and carefully grasps the tip
     of one of the tentacles.  Squeezing tightly, he leans back with all his
     weight.STANDARD(grabbing Faust's hands)

     couple of switches on the wall.  The machine lights up, and Broussard
     is sucked into the slot in the wall.

     He is visible inside.  The machine immediately sprays a cloud of
     disinfectant on him, then sterilizes him with a blinding pink light.

     A bank of video monitors pops on, revealing X-ray images of different
     parts of his body.  Sensors begin to scan, relays chatter.ROBY APPEARS IN THE DOORWAY.Standard turns and looks at him.  For a long moment, the two men regard

     They study the monitors.MELKONISBlood's thoroughly oxygenated.HUNTERYeah, but how?  His nose and mouth
               are blocked.STANDARDLet's look inside his head.

     Standard punches some buttons, and on the monitors, a kind of X-ray
     image in vivid colors appears, depicting Broussard's HEAD AND UPPERTORSO.The parasite is clearly visible on Broussard's face.  In X-ray, the
     creature is a maze of complicated biology.  But the shocking thing is
     that, in X-ray, we can see that Broussard's jaws are forced wide open,
     and THE PARASITE HAS EXTRUDED SOME KIND OF LONG TUBE, WHICH IS STUFFED
     INTO HIS MOUTH AND DOWN HIS THROAT, ending near his stomach.ROBYLook at that.HUNTERWhat is it -- I can't tell
               anything --ROBYIt's some kind of organ -- it's

     Hunter bends over and RETCHES.ROBYI think that's how it's getting
               oxygen to him.HUNTERIt doesn't make any sense.  It
               paralyzes him... puts him into a
               coma... then keeps him alive.MELKONISWe can't expect to understand a life
               form like this.  We're out of our

               can't leave the damn thing on him.MELKONISWe don't know what might happen if
               we tried to kill it.  At least right
               now it's keeping him alive.HUNTERHow about cutting it off?  We can't
               pull it loose, but we can cut off
               everything but the bottom layer,
               where it's stuck to his face.STANDARDYou're right... we can't stand here
               and do nothing.

     Standard picks up his dusty breathing mask and pulls it over his head.
     Then he pulls back on his bulky gloves.  Finally, he presses a switch
     and Broussard slides back out of the booth.STANDARD (CONT'D)(muffled in his mask)
               Somebody give me a scalpel.

     Melkonis takes a glittering surgical blade from a slot in the wall,
     and carefully passes it to Standard.

     Clumsily because of the gloves, Standard manipulates the knife in his
     hand till he has a decent grip on it.  Then he flicks a little button
     with his thumb.  The scalpel begins to hum.

     Standard advances on the parasite.  The others draw back nervously.
     Roby reaches over and draws yet a longer blade from the rack, and
     holds it inconspicuously at his side.

     Standard bends over the parasite.  Carefully, he touches the scalpel to
     the extreme end of one of the tentacles, where it curves toward the
     back of Broussard's head.

     Effortlessly, the electronic blade slides through the alien tissue.
     Immediately, a urine-like fluid begins to flow from the wound.STANDARD (CONT'D)(muffled)
               I've made an incision... it's not
               reacting... but some kind of
               yellowish fluid is leaking out of
               the wound... 

     The noxious-looking liquid drips down onto the bedding next to
     Broussard's head.  Instantly, it starts to hiss, and a thin stream of
     smoke curls up from the stain.STANDARD (CONT'D)(muffled)
               Hold it, this stuff's smoking!

     The others REACT nervously.

     By now, the yellow fluid has eaten a hole through the bunk bed and has
     dripped down onto the floor below.  The metal floor begins to bubble
     and sizzle, and more smoke rises.

     The men start to COUGH.MELKONISGod, that smoke's poisonous!HUNTER(pointing)
               It's eating a hole in the floor!

     Abruptly, the men jostle their way out of the room and huddle in the
     corridor outside, coughing their lungs out.

     Standard, who is masked, remains.  Frantically, he attempts to put a
     bandage on the wound, but the fluid instantly melts the bandage, and
     in the process, some of the stuff gets on Standard's gloves.  They
     begin to smoke.

     Frantically Standard leaps back, pulling off the smouldering gloves.
     Then he runs out into the corridor and yanks off his mask.INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMARYSTANDARDThat stuff's eating right through
               the metal!  It's going to eat through
               the decks and right out through the
               hull!

     By this time Standard has started to run for the stairs.INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIPFollowed by the others, Standard frantically clangs down the stairs to
     the level below.STANDARDThere!  Look!

     A droplet of the fluid is sizzling on the ceiling.  It oozes down and
     drips to the floor.

     It bubbles on the floor.MELKONISJesus, what can we put under it?

     Standard and Hunter charge down the stairs to the level below.INTERIOR - LEVEL BELOWStandard and Hunter move cautiously down the corridor, looking up at
     the ceiling.STANDARD(pointing)
               There.  Should be coming through
               about there.HUNTERCareful, don't get under it!INTERIOR - LEVEL ABOVERoby and Melkonis crouch by the spot on the floor where the acid
     sizzles.MELKONISChrist, that stinks.

     Roby fishes a pen out of his pocket and probes into the hole in the
     floor.ROBYSeems to have stopped penetrating.

     Hunter comes charging up the steps.HUNTERWhat's happening up here?ROBYI think it's fizzled out.

     Hunter approaches and looks.  Roby straightens up, starts to put the
     pen back in his pocket, then changes his mind and stands holding it by
     the end.MELKONISI never saw anything like that in my
               life... except molecular acid.HUNTERBut this thing uses it forblood.MELKONISHell of a defense mechanism.  You
               don't dare kill it.

     Standard comes up the stairs.STANDARDIt's stopped?MELKONISYes, thank heaven.STANDARDWe're just plain lucky.  That could
               have gone right through the hull --
               takenweeksto patch it.MELKONISReminded me of when I was a kid and
               the roof leaked -- everybody running
               for the pots and pans.ROBYMy God, what about Broussard?

     They turn and run up the stairs.INTERIOR - INFIRMARYThey all come into the room (Roby carrying the partially melted pen).
     Broussard is still motionless on the bunk, with the thing on his face.ROBYDid it get on him?

     Standard approaches and peers at Broussard's head.STANDARDNo, thank God... just missed him.MELKONISIs it still dripping?STANDARD(examining it)
               It appears to have healed itself.HUNTERIt makes me sick to see him like
               that.MELKONISIsn't there some way we can get it
               off him?STANDARDI don't see how.  But let's do what
               we can for him.

     Standard presses a button, and Broussard slides back into the
     diagnostic coffin.  He presses more buttons, and the displays light up
     again, showing different parts of Broussard's body.STANDARD (CONT'D)I think we'd better get some
               intravenous feeding started.  God
               knows what that thing is leaching
               out of him.

     Standard operates some controls, and the machine begins to invade
     Broussard's body, sliding needles into him.ROBY(studying the screens)
               Look there, what's that stain on his
               lungs?

     The X-ray reveals a spreading dark blot in the vicinity of Broussard's
     chest.  In the center, the stain is completely opaque.MELKONISIt appears to be a heavy fluid of
               some sort... it blocks the X-rays...ROBYThat tube must be depositing it in
               him.MELKONISCould be some kind of venom, or
               poison...HUNTERThis is horrible.ROBYHey!  what about the film?STANDARDWhat film?ROBYBroussard had film in his datastick,
               didn't he?  We can see what happened
               to him.INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOMAgain we are watching slides in the darkened room.  This time Standard,
     Roby, Melkonis, and Hunter are watching the sequence of photographs
     taken automatically by Broussard's datastick as he probed the tomb.

     The camera reveals the "urns."  The climax of the sequence of stills
     comes when THE CREATURE LEAPS OUT OF THE "URN" TOWARD THE CAMERA --
     and after that the camera drops to a useless angle and proceeds to
     show a series of meaningless blurs.  Then the reel ends.HUNTERThat must have been when he got it.ROBYThe same thing must've happened to
               the creatures on the other ship... 
               except they took one of those jars
               on board, and opened it there.MELKONIS(clicks back through the
                     slides to a picture of
                     one of the "urns")
               At first I thought they were jars
               too, or artifacts anyway.  But
               they're not.  They're eggs, or spore
               casings.  Let's go back to the
               heiroglyphics.

     CLICKETYCLICKETYCLICK -- Melkonis accelerates through the slides in a
     blur, stopping at the one he wants -- which shows a strip of
     heiroglyphs on the wall of the tomb.STANDARDI personally can't make any sense
               out of it... 

     CLICK.  CLICK.  Melkonis is changing the slides as they talk, showing
     different angles on the glyphs.MELKONISIt's a crude symbolic language --
               looks primitive.HUNTERYou can't tell -- that kind of stuff
               could represent printed circuits...STANDARDThat sounds a little fanciful...MELKONISPrimitive pictorial languages are
               based on common objects in the
               environment, and this can be used as
               a starting point for translation...ROBYWhat common objects?HUNTERListen, hadn't somebody better check
               on Broussard?STANDARD(rising)
               I'll do it.  The rest of you
               continue.HUNTER(rising)
               I'll come with you.INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMARYStandard and Hunter come down the passageway.STANDARDYou know, it's fantastic -- the
               human race has gone this long
               without ever encountering another
               advanced life form, and now we run
               into a veritable zoo.HUNTERWhat do you mean?STANDARDWell, those things out there aren't
               the same, you know -- the spaceship
               and the pyramid.  They're from
               different cultures and different
               races.  That ship just landed here --
               crashed like we did.  The pyramid and
               the thing from it are indigenous.HUNTERHow could anything be indigenous to
               this asteroid?  It's dead.STANDARDMaybe it wasn't always dead.

     They arrive at the infirmary.INTERIOR - INFIRMARYThe door slides open, and they step into the room.  Hunter activates
     the bed, and it slides out of the wall.THERE IS A LONG, HORRIFIED PAUSE.HUNTERIt's gone.

     They rush to Broussard's prone form.  THE PARASITE IS GONE FROM HISFACE.Broussard is still unconscious, but he is breathing.  HIS FACE ISCOVERED WITH SUCKER MARKS.HUNTERNow we're in for it.STANDARDThe door was closed.  It must still
               be in here.

     They immediately grow very tense.  Hunter starts edging toward the
     door.  Standard grabs his arm.STANDARD (CONT'D)No, don't open the door.  We don't
               want it escaping.HUNTER(very nervous)
               Well, what the hell good can we do
               in here?  We can't grab it -- it
               might jump on us --STANDARDMaybe we can catch it.

     Standard picks up a stainless steel tray with a lid.STANDARD (CONT'D)As long as we're careful not to
               damage it... 

     Tray in one hand, lid in the other, Standard begins moving slowly
     around the room.  There are very few places to hide.

     He bends down and peers under the bunk.

     As he is down on his hands and knees, WE SEE ONE TENTACLE OF THETHING, VIBRATING ON A LEDGE JUST ABOVE STANDARD.He rises, and HIS SHOULDER BRUSHES THE TENTACLE.  THE PARASITE DROPS TOTHE FLOOR.STANDARD(leaping back)
               Shit!

     But the thing is not moving.  It lies motionless on the floor, its
     tentacles curled up.  Its color has faded to a dead-looking grey.

     Without taking his eyes off the thing, Standard reaches behind him and
     takes a long probe from the wall.  He prods the thing; it does not
     respond.STANDARD (CONT'D)I think it's dead.

     With great care, he uses the probe to fish the motionless parasite
     into the tray.  Then he quickly closes the lid.INTERIOR - LABORATORYStandard, Roby, and Melkonis have the parasite spread-eagled on a
     stainless steel table, with a bright light on it.  It is belly-side up.

     Wearing gloves, Standard probes at the thing with an instrument.STANDARDLook at these suckers -- no wonder
               we couldn't get it off him.ROBYIs that its mouth?MELKONISMore likely that organ -- the tube-
               like thing -- fits up in there.

     With a pair of needle-nosed pliers, Standard fishes in the fleshy
     aperture.  Carefully, he extracts the end of the tube-organ.ROBYUgh.

     Suddenly, it starts to FALL APART IN THE PLIERS.STANDARDQuick -- it's decomposing -- gimme
               something to grab it with!

     It begins to SMOKE AND BUBBLE.

     Roby grabs a long pair of tongs from the wall and thrusts them at
     Standard -- who throws down the pliers, snatches the tongs and seizes
     the thing in the tongs.

     It is smouldering and dripping acid on the floor.STANDARD (CONT'D)Christ!  Let's get it out of here!

     Carrying the thing, he heads for the door.INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIPThe men run down the passageways, Standard carrying the dripping thing
     in the tongs.  It leaves little smoking droplets on the floor.INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCKThey come running up to the airlock.  Roby stabs the button and the
     inner door slides open.  By the time Standard is in the lock, Roby is
     already on the intercom:ROBY(shouts into intercom)
               For Chrissake, open the main lock!INTERIOR - AIR LOCK - DAYRoby stumbles in as the inner door closes; and with a heavy whine, the

     by the inevitable dust.

               dead!

     Melkonis gets down on his knees and studies the small burn-holes in
     the floor.

     Standard opens the inner door and steps out into the corridor.  There,
     he activates the wall intercom and punches out a combination.INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCKHUNTER(over intercom,

               gravity.  It's dead now, but once it
               must have been fertile.MELKONISNo.  It's just too small to support
               fauna as big as the parasites.  If
               there were a native ecology, it
               would have to be microscopic.ROBYCouldn't the pyramid have been built

               expedition.  I'm going to call it
               "The Snark Log."STANDARD(stiffly)
               The commander normally has first
               publication rights.MELKONISMaybe we could write it together.ROBYFirst thing I'm going to do when we
               get back is eat some biological
               food.MELKONISWhat's the matter, you don't like
               this stuff?ROBYTastes like something you'd feed a
               chicken to make it lay more eggs.STANDARDOh it's okay.  I've had better cag
               than this, but I've had worse too,
               if you know what I mean.FAUSTI kind of like it.ROBYYou like this shit?FAUSTIt grows on you.ROBYYou know what they make this stuff
               out of?FAUST(annoyed)
               Yes, I know what they make it out
               of, so what?  It's food now.You'reeating it.ROBYI didn't say it was bad for you,
               it's just kind of sickening, that's
               all.HUNTERDo we have to talk about this kind
               of crap at the dinner table?

     Suddenly, unexpectedly, BROUSSARD GRIMACES AND GROANS.STANDARDWhat's wrong?BROUSSARD(his voice straining)
               I don't know... I'm getting theseCRAMPS!

     The others stare at him in alarm.  Another GROAN is torn from his lips.
     He clutches the edge of the table with his hands, his knuckles
     whitening.STANDARDBreathe deeply.BROUSSARD(screaming)OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD!ROBYWhatDell --what?

     Broussard's face is screwed up into a mask of agony, and he is
     trembling violently from head to foot.BROUSSARD(incoherent shriek)
               OhmygooaaAAAHHHHH!!!A RED SMEAR OF BLOOD BLOSSOMS ON THE CHEST OF BROUSSARD'S TUNIC.THEIR EYES ARE ALL RIVETTED TO BROUSSARD'S CHEST AS THE FABRIC OF HISTUNIC IS RIPPED OPEN, AND A HORRIBLE NASTY LITTLE HEAD THE SIZE OF AMAN'S FIST PUSHES OUT.Everybody SCREAMS and leaps back from the table.  The cat spits and
     bolts.

     The disgusting little head lunges, comes spurting out of Broussard's
     chest trailing a thick, wormlike tail -- splattering fluids and blood
     -- lands in the middle of the dishes and food on the table -- and
     scurries away while the men are stampeding for safe ground.

     When they finally regain control of themselves, it has escaped.
     Broussard lies slumped in his chair, a huge hole in his chest,
     spouting blood.  The dishes are scattered and the food is covered with
     blood and slime.HUNTEROh, no.  Oh, no.FAUSTWhat was that?  What the Christ was
               that?MELKONISIt was growing in him the whole time
               and he didn't even know it!

     Slowly, they gather around Broussard's gutted corpse.ROBYThat thing used him for an
               incubator!EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACEA hatch slides open on the side of the ship, and Broussard's wrapped
     body tumbles silently out.

     AN ELECTRONIC BASS DRUM BEATS A DIRGE as Broussard drifts into
     eternity.INTERIOR - CORRIDORSThe entire remaining crew is walking toward the bridge.MELKONISWe can't go into hypersleep with
               that thing running around loose.HUNTERWe'd be sitting ducks in the
               freezers.ROBYBut we can't kill it.  If we kill it,
               it will spill all its body acids
               right through our hull and out into
               space.FAUSTShit...STANDARDWe'll have to catch it and eject it
               from the ship.MELKONIS(sighs)
               Well, I kind of hate to point it
               out, but all our supplies are based
               on us spending a strictly limited
               amount of time out of suspended
               animation... and as you know, we used
               up most of that time in harvesting.STANDARDWe've got about a week left, right?HUNTERAnd then we run out of food and
               oxygen.FAUSTThe water will still recycle.ROBYWe won't need it then.STANDARDAll right, so that's what we've got.
               A week.  It's plenty of time.ROBYBut if wehaven'tcaught it in a
               week, then we have to go into the
               freezers anyway.

     They enter the bridge.INTERIOR - BRIDGESTANDARDSo does anybody have any
               suggestions?FAUSTWe could put on our pressure suits
               and blow all the air out of the
               ship.  That would kill it.STANDARDNo, we can't afford to lose that
               much oxygen.  We're going to have to
               flush it out.MELKONISHow?STANDARDRoom by room, corridor by corridor.

     No one likes this thought.MELKONISAnd what do we do when we find it?STANDARDWe'll have to trap it somehow.  If we
               had a really strong piece of net, we
               could bag it.FAUSTWe could cut a section out of that
               metallite netting.  It won't hold up
               to that acid, but aside from that
               it's pretty strong.ROBYWe have to avoid injuring it.  What
               we really need is some electric
               animal prods.HUNTERI think I could cobble something
               together.  A long metal rod with a
               battery in it.  Give it a hell of a
               shock.STANDARDGood.  Get on it.  But first, I'm
               issuing a standing order: from this
               moment forth, every one of us will
               wear protective garments, including
               helmets.  Let's get down to the
               locker and change.

     They start for the exit.EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACEThe SNARK continues on its way through the weird vortex of hyperspace.INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIPStandard is walking purposefully along the corridor, alone.  He is
     garmented in an unusual outfit which makes him look like a riot
     policeman, including clear plastic helmet.

     He reaches a corner and turns.  But this new passageway has a different
     gravity orientation -- Standard seems to be walking down a vertical
     wall.

     He makes yet another disorienting turn, and now he is walking upside-
     down.  He reaches a set of steps and climbs up them -- or rather, down
     them.INTERIOR - VENTRAL OBSERVATION DOME - VIEW OF OUTER SPACEMelkonis is seated in the dome, upside-down, peering down into space.
     He also wears the protective suit.

     Standard, upside-down, climbs into the dome.  It is dark and eerie
     here, under the stars of interstellar space.  A few glowing panels
     provide the only illumination.STANDARDI thought I'd find you here.MELKONISI was thinking of a line from an old
               poem: "Water, water everywhere, but
               not a drop to drink."  All that space
               out there, and we're trapped in this
               ship.STANDARDThat's the one about the albatross,
               right?MELKONISWe can't even radio for help; the
               carrier wave wouldn't reach its
               destination till long after we'd
               died and turned to dust.  We are
               utterly, absolutely alone.  Can
               anybody really visualize such a
               scale of distances?  Halfway across
               Creation...STANDARDWe came out there, we'll go back.  A
               long time by the clock, but a short
               time to us.MELKONISTime and space have no meaning out
               here.  We're living in Einsteinian
               equation.STANDARDI can see you're putting your spare
               time to good use.
                    (leans forward and taps
                     him on the knee)
               Let me tell you something: you keep
               staring at hyperspace for long
               enough, they'll be peeling you off a
               wall.  I've seen it happen.MELKONIS(smiles at him)
               We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We
               even have our own special diseases.STANDARDCome on -- let's go above and see
               how they're coming with the gear.INTERIOR - BRIDGEThe whole crew has assembled.  Faust is unfolding several yards of
     shimmering metallic netting.

     Hunter hands out five thin rods, like metal broom handles.HUNTERThese have portable generators in
               them.  They're insulated down to here
               -- just be careful not to touch the
               end.

     He demonstrates by touching the tip of one of the rods to a metal
     object.  A blue spark leaps.FAUSTMight even incinerate the damn
               thing.STANDARD(sharply)
               I hope not.HUNTERDon't worry, it won't damage it,
               it'll just give it a little
               incentive.STANDARDHow do we locate the creature?FAUSTWith these.

     He picks up a small portable unit.FAUST (CONT'D)Tracking device.  You set it to
               search for a moving object... It
               hasn't got much range, but when you
               get within a certain distance, it
               starts beeping.

     Standard takes the device and studies it.STANDARDThese will be very useful.  At least
               we won't have to go digging around
               in closets with our bare hands.  All
               right, here's the battle plan: we're
               going to break into two teams and
               start systematically covering the
               ship.  Whoever finds it first,
               catches it in the net and ejects it
               from the nearest airlock.  Clear?ROBYEven simple.

     Standard shoots him a vicious look, then continues:STANDARDFor starters, let's make sure the
               bridge is safe.

     Faust takes the device and turns it on.  He scans it around the room.FAUSTIt's clear.STANDARDAll right -- Roby and Melkonis will
               go with Faust.  Hunter and I will
               make up the second team.

     They start doling out the equipment.STANDARD (CONT'D)We'll all carry communicators.  We
               want to keep in constant touch.INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIPMelkonis and Roby carry the net, while Faust walks directly behind it,
     carrying the tracking device.  He continually scans it from side to
     side.FAUSTNothing yet... nothing... we can move
               pretty fast as long as there's
               nothing on the tracker.INTERIOR - OTHER CORRIDORSStandard and Hunter move silently along.  Standard is forced to serve a
     double function, carrying one edge of the net and the tracker as well.INTERIOR - CORRIDORSRoby's team is moving at a fairly brisk pace, when:FAUSTHold it.

     Faust's tracker is BEEPING, and a small light flashes.FAUST (CONT'D)I've got something.

     Immediately, they grow very tense and start looking around.ROBYWhere's it coming from?FAUST(peers closely at tracker
                     and frowns)
               Machine's screwed up, I can't tell.
               Needle's spinning all over the dial.MELKONISIs it malfunctioning?

     Faust turns the tracker on its side, and the needle stabilizes.FAUSTNo, just confused.  It's coming from
               below us.

     They all look down at their feet.INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVELRoby, Melkonis, and Faust come carefully down a set of crude metal
     stairs, into a drab, functional section of the ship.

     The corridors in this level are lit by rows of bare bulbs in the
     ceiling.  The effect is ugly and confining.

     They stop at the foot of the stairs and move into position, spreading
     the net across the corridor.ROBYOkay.FAUST(looking at tracker and
                     nodding down the passageway)
               That way.

     They begin to walk down the passageway, footsteps clanging on the raw
     metal flooring.  It is extremely dark.ROBYWhat happened to the lights?FAUSTBulbs burned out, nobody bothered to
               replace 'em.

     They switch on the helmet lights.CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM AROUND A COUPLE OF TURNINGS, AND THEN:FAUST (CONT'D)Hold it.

     They all stop quickly, almost stumbling.FAUST (CONT'D)(whispering)
               It's within 4 meters.

     Roby and Melkonis heft the net, each keeping his prod in hand.  Faust,
     prod in one hand and tracker in the other, has the unpleasant job of
     approaching the source of the signal.

     He moves with great care, in a half crouch, ready to leap back at any
     second, prod extended, constantly glancing at the tracker.

     The tracking device leads him right up to a small hatch or door in one
     wall.

     Behind his plastic mask, sweat is pouring down Faust's face as he sets
     down the tracker and reaches for the little door.  He raises the prod,
     grasps the door handle, yanks it open, and jams the electric prod
     inside.WITH A NERVE-SHATTERING SQUALL, A SMALL CREATURE COMES FLYING OUT OFTHE CABINET, EYES GLARING, CLAWS FLASHING.Instinctively, they throw the net over it, but:ROBY(very annoyed)
               Oh, hold it!

     They open the net and release the creature.  IT IS THE CAT.  Hissing and
     spitting, it scampers away.MELKONISWe're making fools of ourselves!

     Roby's COMMUNICATOR BEEPS.ROBY(into communicator)
               Yes!STANDARD(over, filtered)
               We've got it up here!  It's trapped!
               Get up here fast!ROBYWhere are you?STANDARD(over, filtered)
               Food-storage room!ROBYWe're coming!

     They dash for the stairs.INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIPRoby, Faust, and Melkonis charge down the hallways until they arrive
     at:INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE FOOD STORAGE ROOMStandard and Hunter are waiting for them, in hysterics.HUNTERWe saw it inside and slammed the
               door on it!  It's in there now!

     On the other side of the door, CRASHING AND BANGING can be heard.ROBYWhat's it doing, having a seizure?STANDARDIt started crashing around right
               after we locked it in.ROBYNow what?STANDARDI guess we open the door and net it.HUNTERI hate to open that door.

     Again the thing can be heard CRASHING AROUND INSIDE.STANDARDIt looks completely different from
               the first one -- it's more like a
               worm with legs... and tentacles.FAUSTWell we better do something.HUNTERMaybe we don't have to.  It's trapped
               in there.  We could just leave it in
               there all the way back to Irth.STANDARD(snaps)
               Don't be an idiot.FAUSTI know what we can do.  We can pump
               poison gas into the room and kill
               it.  Through those ventilator slots
               there.

     He indicates a row of slots in the bottom of the door.ROBYHey, wait a minute!  That's all our
               food supplies in there!  We can't
               pump poison gas all over them!STANDARDOnce we kill the thing we won't need
               the food any more -- we can go
               straight into hypersleep.  Also, it
               sounds like that thing is already
               doing a pretty good job on our
               supplies; it may be fouling them
               all.ROBYYou win.FAUSTSomebody gimme a hand, I'll get the
               stuff.INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE FOOD LOCKER - LATERCAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL THAT they are fastening a large funnel-
     shaped device over the ventilator grill at the bottom of the door.
     This funnel is attached to a thick hose, which runs back to a large
     metal tank with pressure gauges.STANDARDGet those masks on.

     They pull on gas masks.ROBYThis stuff's deadly -- I hope we
               know what we're doing.STANDARDGo ahead, Jay.

     Faust turns on the machine.  It begins to throb as it pumps the gas
     through the hose and into the room.

     Immediately, THE CRASHING NOISES RISE IN CRESCENDO, AND THE THING CANBE HEARD SCREECHING AND SQUEALING.Then the sounds stop altogether.STANDARD (CONT'D)Shut it off.

     Faust shuts off the pump.ROBYNow what?STANDARDWhat do you think?  Now we go in.

     Standard steps to the door and opens it.  A thick cloud of gas billows
     out.INTERIOR - FOOD STORAGE ROOMThe room is thick with the poison gas.  The men look like insects in
     their gasmasks.

     The food packages are ripped to shreds, and foodstuffs are scattered
     all over the floor.FAUSTLooks like he helped himself.

     Carefully, the men poke through the garbage, net and prods raised.

     Then Hunter points.HUNTERGod damn it.

     They all look where he is pointing.  In the wall, A VENTILATOR GRILLHAS BEEN RIPPED OPEN.HUNTER (CONT'D)It escaped.

     They move to the shredded ventilator and shine their lights into it.ROBYWhere does that go?FAUSTAll over the ship; we'll have to
               check the charts to know for sure.STANDARDThen let's go and do it.

     They head for the door.HUNTERHave we got any food at all left in
               the ship?

     They slam the door shut and seal it.INTERIOR - BRIDGEThe screens are showing them a schematic of the ship's system of
     ventilator shafts.FAUSTThat one section of the ventilator
               shaft has only two outlets -- you
               notice?  The food storage room on one
               end --HUNTER-- And the cooling unit on the
               other.STANDARDSo it's trapped in between -- now we
               have to drive it out.FAUSTPoison gas...HUNTERWe can't pump poison gas down into
               the cooling unit!  It'll flood the
               whole ship!STANDARDThe only other thing I can think of
               is for somebody to crawl in there
               and flush it out.ROBYAre youcrazy?STANDARDThe man would need protection,
               obviously -- as well as some way to
               drive the thing before him.FAUSTHow about a flamethrower?  That
               wouldn't poison the air.MELKONISSo one of us goes into the airshaft
               and drives the thing along --STANDARDWhile the rest of us wait down in
               the cooling unit with the net.HUNTERSounds like a rough one.STANDARDGot a better idea?

     Hunter shrugs.ROBYSo the only question left is: who
               gets to crawl down the airshaft?STANDARDLet's be democratic.

     He tears five small sheets of paper from a pad on his console.  On one
     of them, he draws a large X.  Then he wads each piece of paper into a
     tiny little ball.

     He rolls the paperballs between his hands and tosses them on the table
     like dice.STANDARD (CONT'D)Martin, take one.

     Roby picks one up and unfolds it.  It is blank.

     Melkonis picks up another and opens it.  Again blank.

     Faust picks up a ball, and Standard immediately picks his own up.  They
     are both blank.

     They all look at Hunter, who has not yet unfolded his.STANDARD (CONT'D)Open it up, Cleave.INTERIOR - FOOD STORAGE ROOMHunter is strapping on an oxygen mask and a flame thrower.  Faust is
     helping him.

     Finally, Faust hands him a tracking device.FAUSTWell, uh... good luck.  I hope you
               won't need me, but if you do, I'm
               here.HUNTER(grimly)
               Right.

     Hunter turns and climbs into the ventilator opening, which is just
     large enough to crawl through.INTERIOR - AIR SHAFTIt is completely dark in the shaft.  Hunter reaches up and turns on his
     helmet light.  Then he switches on his radio.HUNTERHey, do you guys read me down there?INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOMStandard, Melkonis and Roby are spreading out the net.  We hear the hum
     of huge cooling plants, and their hair ruffles.  Large airshafts run
     off in different directions.STANDARDYeah, we're getting into position.INTERIOR - AIR SHAFTHUNTEROkay, I'm starting now.

     He begins to crawl forward into the narrow metal tunnel.  He turns a
     corner.

     After a couple more tight turns, THE TRACKER SUDDENLY BEEPS.

     Hunter twitches.  He raises his flamethrower and FIRES A BLAST INTO THE
     DARKNESS.  It roars loudly in the confined tube, and the air instantly
     heats up.  Smoke drifts back into his face.  He begins to sweat.INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOMRoby points to a large rectangular opening in one wall.ROBY(pointing)
               There.  That's where it's got to come
               out.

     He throws a switch, and a large metal panel rises and seals off the
     opening.ROBY (CONT'D)That's a flip-flop gate to channel

     Melkonis is setting up a little portable unit with a screen on it.  The
     screen shows a section of the ship's schematic.MELKONISI've got Hunter... and something else
               as well, in front of him.STANDARDAre they close?MELKONISThey're on the next level up.STANDARDLet's get moving with this net.

     They lift the net up, holding it in front of the opening.INTERIOR - AIR SHAFTHunter is still crawling on hands and knees.  Up ahead, he can see that
     the shaft takes an abrupt downward turn.

     He crawls toward the down angle, then fires another blast from his
     flamethrower.

     Then he starts crawling down, head first.

     When he is nearly upside-down, the shaft takes yet another turning
     which puts him into a nearly impossible position, almost immobilized.

     Then the tracker starts BEEPING LIKE CRAZY.

     Frantically, he fumbles the flamethrower around, but the space is
     narrow -- it is difficult maneuvering.  He hears a HISSING CRY up
     ahead, and claws scrambling on metal.

     Then he has the weapon into position, and sprays another lethal
     flaming burst toward the sound.INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOMMelkonis is staring at his screen.MELKONISThey're getting pretty close now.STANDARDAll right, then -- when it gets to
               the other side of the door, you sing

     He readies the flamethrower.INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOMSTANDARDOkay, get ready.

     He and Roby heft their respective ends of the net, crouched to catch
     the small creature when it darts out.  Melkonis picks up his electric
     prod.STANDARD (CONT'D)Open the vent, Sandy.

     Melkonis reaches over and throws the switch.  The metal gate drops
     down, opening up the shaft.A SIX-FOOT MONSTROSITY STANDS IN THE OPENING.  GHASTLY BEYONDIMAGINATION, SQUAMOUS, COVERED WITH TENTACLES, IT HOPS DOWN LIKE ANOVER-SIZED BIRD AND GRABS MELKONIS IN RAZOR-SHARP TENTACLES.Melkonis lets out a horrible shriek, and the thing grabs his head in

     climbs out of the shaft.HUNTERWhat happened?  Where is it?

     They break from their paralysis, and run toward the opening the
     creature just leaped into.  It is another shaft, going down into
     darkness.STANDARD(awed)

	Faust exits.ROBYI think it's time we took a hard
               look at those heiroglyphs.

     Roby begins to punch buttons; the photographs of the heiroglyphics
     appear on some of the screens.ROBY (CONT'D)Can you make out any pattern in all
               that?STANDARD(baffled)
               Well... yes... there's a pattern... but
               it's meaningless to me.ROBYI know it looks like a senseless
               jumble, but if you look closely,
               there are recognizable forms.HUNTERRecognizable!  In that?ROBYIn symbolic form... very stylized... 
               but if you stare at it, you can see
               some of the different creatures
               we've been dealing with.HUNTERWell... I suppose that star-shaped
               thing could be the parasite that got
               on Broussard.  Is that what you mean?ROBYAnd right next to it, that oval
               design with the markings -- it's a
               dead ringer for the spore casings.STANDARDThat next thing there -- six legs,
               tentacles -- that's the thing we saw
               in the food locker.ROBYSo the next step should be --HUNTER-- The big one.  And there it is.

     Out of meaningless geometric symbols on a wall, it has become possible
     to recognize each stage in the alien's life cycle.ROBYThis is all the same creature.  We're
               seeing the different stages in its
               life-cycle.STANDARDThen that tomb... must have been some
               kind of fertility temple... where
               they stored their eggs, and maybe
               held mating rituals...HUNTER... And Broussard got caught in their
               reproductive cycle.ROBYYou will notice, though, that there
               are no more phases.  Only four forms
               are shown.  After that the pattern
               repeats.STANDARDWhich presumably means...ROBY... More spores coming.INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCKFaust quickly turns a couple of corners and then comes to an abrupt
     halt when he notices that a DOOR LEADING TO THE LOWER DECKS HAS BEENWRENCHED OFF ITS HINGES.He hesitates, uncertain what to do, then there is A SOUND FROM THEDIRECTION OF THE AIR LOCK... AND THE INNER LOCK DOOR IS OPEN.Faust hesitates and peers into the lock.INTERIOR - AIR LOCKThe creature is squatting in the middle of the floor, gnawing on a
     bloody thigh bone.  It does not see Faust.INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCKStealthfully, dropping back into the shadows, Faust presses the wall
     intercom and speaks into it.FAUST(whispering)
               It's in the lock -- blow the main
               lock.INTERIOR - BRIDGEStandard, Roby and Hunter are staring at the pictures.  The call from
     Faust catches Standard in mid-sentence.STANDARD(into intercom)

               It's in the main air lock.  Blow the
               lock.INTERIOR - BRIDGEStandard hesitates, starts to frame a reply -- then changes his mind
     and runs to his console -- and THROWS THE SWITCH.INTERIOR - AIR LOCKWith a mechanical whine, the inner door starts to close.  The creature
     hears it and INSTANTANEOUSLY LEAPS OUT OF THE LOCK.INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCKThe creature comes flying out of the lock and DEALS FAUST A BACK-HANDED BLOW, KNOCKING HIM ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF THE AIR LOCK DOOR.FAUST SCREAMS IN MORTAL AGONY AS THE INNER DOOR CLOSES ON HIS WAIST,crushing him to a thickness of about three inches.

     On the wall, a green light goes on:"INNER DOOR CLOSED"INTERIOR - AIR LOCKDespite the fact that the inner door is still held open a few inches
     by Faust's squashed body, THE OUTER DOOR BEGINS TO SLIDE OPEN.IMMEDIATELY, THERE IS A TREMENDOUS SCREAM OF ESCAPING AIR.EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACEIn dead silence, a thick spurt of steam comes out of the open air lock
     door.  This is the ship's atmosphere freezing as it squirts out into
     the vacuum under pressure.INTERIOR - BRIDGEINSTANTLY, A TREMENDOUS WINDSTORM STARTS UP as the ship's air is
     sucked out toward the lock.A SIREN BEGINS TO SOUND, AND A RED LIGHT FLASHES:"CRITICAL DEPRESSURIZATION"After a moment of panic and confusion, Roby bolts out of the control
     room.INTERIOR - CORRIDORSLoose papers and articles of furniture hurtle through the passageways,
     as Roby hurries toward the rock, partly running, partly sucked along
     by the air current.EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACEA huge plume of steam grows from the side of the ship, with all kinds
     of tiny loose particles tumbling out in it.INTERIOR - CORRIDORSWhipped by the hurricane wind, Roby crashes to a momentary halt
     against a wall.  As he hesitates there, trying to regain his balance,HE SEES THE CREATURE SCURRYING AWAY DOWN ANOTHER CORRIDOR.Ignoring the monster, he pushes off from the wall and starts running
     again.INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCKRoby stops himself by grabbing the edge of a doorway at the end of the
     hall down from the airlock.  Here, the wind is really terrific -- his
     clothes flap on his body and all kinds of things fly by -- the sound
     is a DEAFENING WHISTLE.

     Instantly, Roby starts turning a large wheel, which begins to close a
     sliding hatch door, closing off the air lock corridor.  As the hatch
     closes, THE CURRENT DECREASES, THEN IS FINALLY CUT OFF AS HE SEALS IT.

     Done in, he collapses to the floor.

     Then he clutches his throat and begins to gasp for breath.  Because of
     the thinness of the air, THE SOUND LEVEL IN THE SHIP IS VERY ODD --
     THIN, DISTANT, ALMOST INAUDIBLE.  Roby is gasping loudly, but we can
     barely hear him; and his footsteps boom thinly like a man walking
     underwater.INTERIOR - CORRIDORSClutching his throat, he comes across the others -- Standard and
     Hunter -- and they are all choking, clawing at their throats, gasping
     like fishes out of water.  They are sweating heavily and their noses
     bleed.

     They try to speak to each other, but the sound is so muffled we can
     only hear distant croaks.

     Standard mumbles something and stumbles down the hall.  The others
     follow him.INTERIOR - MAIN AIR TANK ROOMThe door bursts open and Standard reels in, his footsteps pinging
     thinly on the metal flooring.  We see several rows of large oxygen
     tanks, all connected by hoses to a few petcocks.

     Standard staggers to these and starts twisting the handles, opening
     them.  THERE IS A PIERCING HISS OF ESCAPING AIR, AND THE SOUND LEVEL
     GRADUALLY RETURNS TO NORMAL as Standard and the others sink to the
     floor, gasping in the oxygen gratefully.

     Finally they have recovered enough to be able to sit up.ROBYHow much oxygen did we lose?

     Standard rises unsteadily and peers at the gauges.STANDARDWe've got six hours left.HUNTER(groans)
               Oh my God.STANDARDDoes anybody know what happened?ROBYI saw it.  Faust got himself jammed
               in the air lock door.  His body held
               it open.STANDARDCan we get to him?ROBYNo, I had to seal off a whole
               section.  We'd lose too much of our
               remaining air if we opened the
               connecting door.INTERIOR - AIR LOCKFaust's body, crushed in the inner door, floats weightlessly in the
     vacuum.  His nose and mouth are crusted with huge gobs of dried blood.INTERIOR - BRIDGEThe three survivors -- Standard, Roby and Hunter -- slump into chairs.

     The cat emerges from a hiding place, yowling with fear.ROBY(picking up the cat)
               Poor kitty; puss puss puss.STANDARDAt least we're rid of the damn
               monster.  It must have been the first
               thing sucked out of the ship.ROBYNo such luck.  I saw it running down

               Oh no!  We can't fight this thing!
               There's only six hours of air left

               to destroy it and get ourselves in
               the freezers.HUNTERHow?STANDARDIt's time for drastic remedies.ROBYIt was time for that a couple days
               ago.STANDARDThat kind of remark is pointless.

               suggestion you can come up with, no
               matter how wild.HUNTERWe can't kill it on board.  It's huge
               now and must have tremendous amounts
               of that acid in its body.ROBYI've got an idea, but you're not
               going to like it.STANDARDLet's hear it.ROBYOkay.  First we shut down all the
               cooling systems on the stardrive
               engines.STANDARDThat'll blow the ship up.ROBYRight... but it'll take a few minutes
               for the engines to overheat and melt
               down the core.  In the meantime, we
               get in the lifeboat and leave the
               ship.HUNTERBlow the ship up?ROBYAnd the creature with it.  We can
               make it back to Irth in the
               lifeboat.STANDARDBut the lifeboat can't accelerate to
               light speed.ROBYDoesn't matter -- we're already at
               light speed.  And when we get back to
               the Colonies, they'll pick us up in
               the network.HUNTERWhat about all the minerals and
               elements in the cargo hold?  That's
               the only reason we came out here.
               We'd have to abandon them all.  We'd
               be broke.ROBYOur lives are more important.
               Anyway, we can take a small amount
               of the most valuable stuff with us
               on the lifeboat.STANDARDNo, it won't work and I just
               realized why.  There's only one
               hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat.
               Only one of us could survive.ROBYYeah... I forgot.STANDARDBut the idea's good, if we could
               just turn it around somehow.

     They think.STANDARD (CONT'D)If we could just get thecreatureinto the lifeboat, we could launch
               it into space and blow it up.HUNTERGood!  That's good!STANDARDWe can load the lifeboat up with
               explosives and trigger them
               remotely, once the lifeboat is in
               space.ROBYI think it's going to be almost
               impossible to drive it up into the
               lifeboat.HUNTERWe can use the flamethrower.ROBYIt's not going to work.STANDARDYou can't say that; I think it's a
               good plan.HUNTERThe flamethrower needs more fuel.STANDARDRight.  We've got a lot to
               accomplish.  Let's get moving.INTERIOR - MINING & CARGO BAYThe three men come down steps into this rather dirty area of the ship.
     A lot of tools and large items of machinery are stored around.LONG RACKS OF SHELVES ARE STOCKED WITH METAL CONTAINERS OF VARIOUSSHAPES.  Each container is well packed and labelled.HUNTERWhich explosive should we use?STANDARDI'd suggest the N-13 sticks.  They're
               portable, and they can be radio
               detonated.

     Hunter begins to unlock a locker and draw out long, red sticks like
     broomhandles, with tiny printing on them.

     Meanwhile, ROBY IS STARING AT THE ROWS OF METAL CANNISTERS.  He touches
     one of them.ROBYYou know, it's funny -- this stuff
               we went to so much trouble to dig up
               -- this treasure, the paydirt --
               it'll make it back to Irth just fine
               -- even if we're not with it.STANDARDHere, carry these.

     Hunter takes an armload of the red broomsticks, and stumbles.ROBY(grabbing at him)Hey watch it!STANDARD(grinning)
               It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop
               it.

     They begin to carry the explosives up the steps.INTERIOR - CORRIDORThe three men are carrying their equipment along the hallway, when
     Hunter's tracker suddenly BEEPS.HUNTERHold it!

     They all stop.  The tracker BEEPS AGAIN.  Hunter puts down his stuff and
     points the tracker around.HUNTER (CONT'D)(nodding up some steps)
               Up there.

     They all look at each other.  Standard puts down his bundle and picks
     up the flamethrower.ROBYSo what do we do?  Do we ignore it
               and finish loading the explosives
               into the boat -- or do we flush it
               out now?STANDARDNow.  If we can get it into the boat,
               we won't have to blow it up -- we
               can just eject it into space.

     Standard hefts the flamethrower and starts up the steps.INTERIOR - DIM STAIRWELLStandard's face is tense as he advances up the circular steps.
     Suddenly, a METALLIC TAPPING SOUND is heard.  He freezes.

     Then he continues up.EXTERIOR - DORSAL OBSERVATION DOME - VIEW OF OUTER SPACEThe view of interstellar space is spectacular.  As Standard comes up
     the steps, the METALLIC TAPPING is heard again.

     Standard looks around.  Then he sees it -- BROUSSARD'S CORPSE FLOATS
     OUTSIDE THE GLASS OF THE DOME.  It is tangled in some rigging, and the
     movement of the machinery causes the cadaver to tap on the glass
     periodically.STANDARD(shouts)
               You can come up!  It's safe!

     The others come up the steps.ROBY(spying the corpse)
               Oh -- Jesus --

     Broussard's corpse is blue and bloated where the wrappings have torn
     loose.  Bumping against the glass, he looks like he wants to come in.STANDARDThe ship's gravitational attraction
               must have drawn him back.HUNTER(horrified)
               Should we go outside and bring him
               in?STANDARDNo... the risk is too great.  Perhaps
               after we've destroyed the thing.

     Glancing back, the men retreat from the observation dome.  Broussard
     remains against the glass, peering in with dead eyes.INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIPThe floor slopes upward slightly here as the corridor funnels in and
     ends in the entrance to a narrow passageway or crawl-way.  This
     passageway connects the nose of the ship with the lifeboat.

     The three men come up to the entrance to the passageway, carrying the
     equipment.  They duck in and walk the short distance to the lifeboat.INTERIOR - LIFEBOATThe passageway connects into the rear of the lifeboat.  It is an
     extremely simple, stripped-down vehicle; even the metal struts and
     beams-are exposed.  A single hypersleep freezer takes up a fair amount
     of floor space.  It is an escape-craft, nothing more.STANDARD(pointing)
               Along the base of the walls there.

     They begin to stack the red broomsticks against the base of the walls
     on both sides of the lifeboat, and to wire them into position tightly.HUNTERThis should do it.ROBYI should hope so!  And we'd better
               make sure it's pretty far from the
               ship when we blow it.STANDARDIt will be.HUNTER(surveys the craft uneasily)
               What we really need is some red meat
               in here for bait.ROBYWell, if we had some, I'd eat it.
               I'm starting to get hungry.

     By this time, they are exiting.INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIPSTANDARDWell... now we have to herd that
               thing up here.HUNTER(nervously)

               have their hands pretty full.  I
               think somebody should stay by the
               lifeboat to slam the door on the
               thing once it's inside, and to serve
               as... as...

               hands free to lock the creature in

               blow it too... if the others are

     INSERT: THREE CRUMPLED PIECES OF PAPER.  Three hands pick them up.

     ANGLE ON ROBY.  He unfolds his paper, turns it so the others can see
     it.  It has a big X on it.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - SHORTLY LATER.  Hunter is showing Roby a small device
     like a transistor radio.HUNTERJust keep your finger off the button
               till she's way away from the ship,

               it will blow the whole nose of the

                     breast pocket)STANDARDAll right, Martin, we'll be in touch
               with you on the communicator.ROBYAnd you'll let me know when you've
               got it coming this way...STANDARDAnd you stand aside while we drive
               it in, then shut the hatch, launch
               the boat, and --ROBYKablooey.

     Hunter's face twitches nervously at this.STANDARDCome on; we haven't much time, air
               is a factor.

     They leave the nose of the ship, Standard carrying the flamethrower,
     Hunter the tracker.

     Roby settles himself at the controls, runs through them briefly to
     familiarize himself.  Using a switch, he opens and closes the lifeboat
     door a couple of times.  It slams open and shut quite rapidly.

     He presses a few buttons and sets the launch button to "READY."

     Then STANDARD'S VOICE comes from the communicator:STANDARD(over, filtered)
               We've got something on the
               tracker... got to be it, it's
               too big for the cat.

     This is a VERY SPOOKY SCENE, ROBY ALONE BY THE LIFEBOAT, LISTENING TOTHE VOICES ON THE COMMUNICATOR.HUNTER(over, filtered)
               It's coming from down there.

     Roby hears various tinny sound effects, rustlings, clunkings,
     breathing, etc.INTERIOR - CORRIDOR IN SHIPStandard has the flamethrower at the ready, and Hunter is staring at
     the tracker.HUNTERIt must have stopped moving.  I'm not
               getting anything.STANDARDLet me go first; you stay behind me.

     Carefully, Standard advances down the corridor.  Then THE CREATURE POPS
     OUT OF HIDINGBEHINDHUNTER, AND PICKS HIM UP.HUNTER SCREAMS.Standard whirls around, sees the thing clutching Hunter.  It holds him
     off to one side, as though to keep Standard from getting at him.

     Standard doesn't know what to do.HUNTERThe flamethrower!STANDARDI can't, the acid will pour out!

     At that moment the creature TAKES A BITE OUT OF HUNTER, WHO SCREAMS INMORTAL AGONY.Standard can take it no longer; he raises the flamethrower and fires-- BUT THE CREATURE SWINGS HUNTER AROUND AS A SHIELD AND HUNTERCATCHES THE FULL BLAST OF THE FLAME.Standard instantly stops firing, but now Hunter is a kicking ball of
     flame, held out at arm's length by the monster.INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIPRoby is listening to all this on the communicator.  He can hear the
     shrieks and crashing noises.

     Then the communicator goes dead, and all he hears is a rush of static.ROBYHello?  Standard?  Hunter?

     He waits quite a while for a response, but we can see from his
     expression that he expects none.

     He drops his face into his hands.  When he lifts his head again, he has
     managed to summon a certain amount of resolve.INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIPRoby walks along watching the tracker, carrying a pistol in the other
     hand.  He comes across Standard's flamethrower, lying on the floor.  He
     picks it up, substituting it for the pistol.

     Then he continues to follow the tracker; it takes him down the steps
     into the maintenance level.INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVELRoby follows the device for a short distance until it indicates that
     the source of the signal is directly under his feet.  Looking down, he
     sees that he is standing on a square metal plate.

     Getting down on his hands and knees, he removes the heavy plate,
     revealing a black opening with a ladder going down.

     Substituting the tracker for a flashlight, but still carrying the
     flamethrower, Roby starts down the ladder.INTERIOR - DARK STORAGE ROOMShining the light around into the darkness, Roby descends the metal
     ladder to the floor.THE PLACE IS A HORRIBLE LAIR, FULL OF BONES, HAIR, SHREDS OF FLESH,PIECES OF CLOTHING, AND SHOES.Something moves in the darkness -- Roby turns his light on it.

     HANGING FROM THE CEILING IS A HUGE COCOON.  It appears to be woven from
     some fine, white, silk-like material, and it is slowly undulating.

     Flamethrower ready, Roby approaches the cocoon.  As he gets close
     enough, he sees that the cocoon is semi-transparent and THE BODY OFSTANDARD IS INSIDE IT.Unexpectedly, Standard's eyes open, and focus on Roby -- who jumps
     violently.STANDARD(a feeble whisper)
               Kill me...ROBY(sickened)
               What did it do to you?STANDARD(moves his head slightly)
               Look... 

     Roby turns his light where Standard indicates.  Another cocoon dangles
     from the ceiling, but this one looks a little different.  It is smaller
     and darker, with a harder shell.  In fact, it looks almost EXACTLY LIKETHE SPORES IN THE TOMB.STANDARD (CONT'D)(whispering)
               That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter...ROBY(looking around for a tool)
               I'll get you out of there.STANDARDNo... don't...ROBYBut I can save you -- get you to the
               Autodoc!STANDARDNo good... it's eaten too much of
               me...ROBY(in horror)
               What can I do?STANDARDKill me... 

     Roby stares at him in horror, then bends down and takes a closer look
     at him.  REACTING, he straightens back up, raises the flamethrower, and
     sprays a molten blast.  When the entire room is in flames, he turns and
     scrambles back up the ladder.INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVELRoby drops to his knees and gasps for breath, trying not to throw up.
     At length, he regains control of himself.EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE - AT LIGHT SPEEDThe SNARK appears to hang motionless, with planets and star clusters
     rolling past in the infinite distance.INTERIOR - BRIDGERoby is putting the cat into a metal, vacuum-sealed catbox, with a
     little oxygen tank on it.ROBYKitty go bye-bye.

     He seals the catbox, then turns on the oxygen.  There is a faint hiss
     of pressurized air.  Wild-eyed, the cat peers out of a little window in
     front.  It YOWLS.

     He picks up the pressurized catbox and leaves the bridge.INTERIOR - MINING & CARGO BAYCarrying the catbox and a shoulder bag (and of course the
     flamethrower), Roby goes quickly to the nearest rank of metal
     cannisters.ROBY(reading from labels)
               What'll it be, Kitty?  Here -- how
               about some Tacitum-35, ten kilos of
               it.  This'll buy us an island on some
               nice planet.

     Putting the invaluable cannister into the shoulder bag, he hurries
     back up the steps.INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOMCatbox in one hand, flamethrower in the other, Roby enters the engine
     room, containing the massive stardrive engines.

     He puts down his parcels and approaches the main control board for the
     engines.  Studying the instructions, he begins to close switches, one
     by one.A SIREN BEGINS TO HONK THROUGHOUT THE SHIP.COMPUTERAttention!  The cooling units for the
               stardrive engines are not
               functioning!  Engines will overload
               in 4 minutes, 50 seconds!  Attention!

     Finally Roby closes the last switch.  Shaking with nervousness, he
     hurriedly picks up catbox, bag and flamethrower and hurries out of the
     engine room.INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIPRoby hurries on, listening to the siren.COMPUTERAttention!  Engines will overheat and
               main core will melt in 4 minutes, 30
               seconds!INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIPRoby comes hustling up to where the lifeboat is berthed.  Hands full,
     he starts to enter the connecting passageway.INTERIOR - CONNECTING PASSAGEWAYTHE CREATURE IS WAITING AT THE OTHER END OF THE PASSAGEWAY, INSIDE THELIFEBOAT.It HISSES and starts toward him.INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIPRoby leaps out of the passageway, bounds to the controls, and throws
     the switch.  The hatch door SLAMS SHUT, locking the thing in the
     lifeboat.COMPUTERAttention!  Engines will overload in
               4 minutes!

     Indecisive, Roby stares at the lifeboat "LAUNCH" button.  The thing can
     be heard fumbling around in the passageway.

     Finally, he turns and bolts back toward the engine room.INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIPLike a maniac, Roby runs through the ship, level after level, pounding
     down stairwells, his footsteps clanging metallically throughout the
     ship as he sprints for the engine room.COMPUTERAttention!  Engines will overload in
               3 minutes, 30 seconds!INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOMThe door crashes open and Roby comes running in.  The room is full of
     smoke and the engines are whining dangerously.  It is extremely hot in
     the room; Roby instantly breaks out in sweat.

     He runs to controls and begins throwing back on the cooling unit
     switches.

     Still THE SIREN CONTINUES.COMPUTERAttention!  Engines will overload in
               3 minutes!

     Roby pushes a button and speaks into it.ROBYComputer!  I've turned all the
               cooling units back on!  What's wrong?COMPUTERThe reaction has proceeded too far.
               The core has begun to melt.  Engines
               will overload in 2 minutes, 35
               seconds.

     A look of terror comes onto Roby's face.  He turns and runs from the
     engine room.INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIPAgain, Roby must run through all the levels of the ship, this timeupthe stairs, exhausted, stumbling, while the computer counts down:COMPUTERAttention!  Engines will overload in
               2 minutes!INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIPReeling, gasping for breath, Roby staggers into the vestibule where
     the lifeboat is berthed.  He grabs the flamethrower and turns it toward
     the passageway.

     It is then he realizes that THE LIFEBOAT DOOR IS OPEN AGAIN.

     Quickly, he glances around to see if the creature might be behind him.
     Then he advances on the passageway.INTERIOR - PASSAGEWAYDripping with sweat, his face a mask of fear, Roby enters the
     passageway, flamethrower gripped tightly in his hands.  He is goaded on
     by the siren and the computer:COMPUTERAttention!  Engines will explode in
               90 seconds!

     He makes it all the way to the end of the passageway, then sticks his
     head into the lifeboat.INTERIOR - LIFEBOATHIS POINT-OF-VIEW as he quickly scans the lifeboat, reveals that it isEMPTY.INTERIOR - PASSAGEWAYImmediately, he turns and dashes back to the head of the passageway.
     There he grabs the catbox and bag, then runs back into the lifeboat.COMPUTERAttention!  Engines will explode in
               60 seconds!INTERIOR - LIFEBOATHe comes in on the run, hurls the catbox and bag toward the front, and
     does a dive over the back of the control chair.  He is no sooner in the
     seat than he hits the "LAUNCH" button.EXTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP - OUTER SPACEThe retainer clips drop away, and with a blast of ramjets, THELIFEBOAT IS LAUNCHED AWAY FROM THE "SNARK."INTERIOR - LIFEBOATRoby is frantically strapping himself in, as the lifeboat accelerates
     away from the mother ship.EXTERIOR - SPACEThe tiny pod of the lifeboat accelerates away from the larger bulk of
     the SNARK.  The scene is strangely serene for such deadly
     circumstances.INTERIOR - LIFEBOATRoby finishes strapping himself in, then he reaches and grabs the
     catbox.  The cat is YOWLING.  Roby hugs the box to his chest and hunches
     his head down over it.EXTERIOR - SPACEThe SNARK drifts ever farther away as the lifeboat leaves it behind,
     until it is barely a point of light.THEN IT BLOWS UP.AN EXPANDING ORANGE FIREBALL WITH PIECES OF METAL FLYING IN ALLDIRECTIONS.INTERIOR - LIFEBOATThe shockwave hits the escape craft, jolting it and rattling
     everything inside.  Then all is quiet.

     Roby unhooks himself from his straps, rises, and goes to the back of
     the lifeboat.  He stares out through the porthole.  His face is bathed
     in orange light.EXTERIOR - SPACEWhat he sees is the boiling fireball, now fading and fizzling away
     into nothingness, and a couple of pieces of debris floating past.INTERIOR - LIFEBOATRoby's expression is mournful as he watches the final obliteration of
     his ship and friends.BEHIND HIM, THE CREATURE EMERGES FROM SOME HIDING PLACE -- IT HAS BEENINSIDE THE LIFEBOAT ALL ALONG.The cat SCREECHES.

     Roby whirls, and finds himself facing the thing across the length of
     the boat.  It squats, then pulls out its trophy -- a man's arm.

     It begins to eat the arm, watching Roby.

     His first thought is for the flamethrower -- unfortunately, it lies on
     the floor right next to the monster.  Next he glances around for any
     place to hide.  His eye falls on a tiny locker containing a space suit,
     with the door standing open.

     He begins to edge toward the locker.  The creature rises.  He freezes.

     It throws down the arm.  With that, Roby dives for the open locker
     door, hurls himself inside, and slams the door shut.INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKERThere is a clear glass panel in the door, and the thing puts its face
     right up to the glass, peering in at Roby.  The locker is so small that
     Roby's face is only inches away from the creature's.  The sight is
     disgusting.  It turns its head, looking at him in curiosity.

     Then the MOANING OF THE CAT distracts it.INTERIOR - LIFEBOATThe creature waddles over to where the pressurized catbox sits.  It
     bends down and peers inside.  The CAT YOWLS LOUDER.

     It picks up the catbox in its tentacles.INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKERTrying to distract the monster away from the cat, Roby TAPS ON THEGLASS.But the monster reacts so fast that its face is instantly back at the
     glass, startling the hell out of Roby.

     Getting no more interference from him, the thing returns to the
     catbox.

     Roby looks around.  He spies the spacesuit.  Quickly, he begins to pull
     it on.INTERIOR - LIFEBOATThe creature picks the catbox up in its tentacles and shakes it to see
     if there is anything inside.  The cat MOANS.INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKERRoby is halfway into the pressure suit.INTERIOR - LIFEBOATThe creature throws the catbox down.  It clangs, and bounces.  The thing
     picks it up again and hammers it against the wall.  Then it jams it
     into a crevice in the wall.

     With one tentacle, it begins to pound the sealed catbox into the
     crevice.  The cat has gone beyond hysterics.INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKERRoby pulls on the helmet, latches it into place, then turns on the
     oxygen.  With a hiss, the suit fills itself.

     In a rack on the wall is a long metal rod with a blunt rubber tip.
     Roby peels the rubber off, revealing a sharp steel point.

     Again he raps on the glass.INTERIOR - LIFEBOATThe creature turns.  It faces the locker, peers at him.INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKERROBYTry a little of this, you fucking
               bastard.HE KICKS THE DOOR OPEN.INTERIOR - LIFEBOATThe creature rises, but just in time to catch THE STEEL SHAFT RIGHTTHROUGH ITS MIDRIFF.IT MAKES A HORRIBLE NOISE AND CLUTCHES AT THE SPUR.  The yellow acid
     begins to flow from the wound.

     Before the acid can touch the floor, Roby reaches back and pulls a
     switch -- BLOWING THE REAR HATCH.

     In a poof, the tiny atmosphere in the lifeboat is sucked out into
     space -- and the bleeding creature along with it.  Roby grabs a steel
     strut to keep from being sucked out, but as the creature passes him ITWRAPS THE END OF A TENTACLE AROUND HIS ANKLE.EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACERoby is now hanging halfway out of the lifeboat, with the thing
     clinging to his leg.  He kicks at it with his free foot, but it won't
     let go.INTERIOR - LIFEBOATLooking for any salvation, Roby grabs the hatch control lever and
     yanks it.

     The hatch slams shut, closing Roby safely inside but TRAPPING THE ENDOF THE CREATURE'S TENTACLE IN THE DOORJAMB.It instantly releases Roby, who staggers back.EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACEThe creature is now outside the lifeboat, in the vacuum, squirming,
     the tip of its tentacle caught in the closed hatch.INTERIOR - LIFEBOATWhere the tentacle is caught in the hatch, it is wounded, and is
     starting to foam with acid, eating away at the metal.

     Roby stumbles forward to the controls and pushes a lever labeled:"RAM JETS"EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACEThe jet exhausts are located at the rear of the craft, right where the

     directions.  The last we see of it is a few smouldering rags, dwindling
     into infinity.DISSOLVE TO:INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - LATERThe boat is re-pressurized and Roby is seated in the control chair.  He
