                                      David O'MalleySHOOTING DRAFTFADE IN ON:EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - NIGHTThe sultry dampness of a blistering summer hangs in the night 
               air. People stroll the boardwalk looking for a cool breeze. 
               The soft rhythms of a jazz concert float from the band shell.CLOSE SHOT - A PAIR OF SEXY HIGH HEELSand a woman's shapely legs, walking along the wooden pier.OPENING TITLES & CREDITS OVER.After several steps, a discarded piece of gum sticks to one 
               of her shoes, stretching out stickily. Two steps later, a 
               piece of paper sticks to the gum, flopping awkwardly with 
               each step.

               The MOVING CAMERA PANS UP her gorgeous legs and sensuous 
               body. She wears a loose summer dress that floats like gossamer 
               around her soft curves. Her hair is long and blond.NED (V.O.)To some guys, women are like a cheap 
                         puzzle... with pieces that just don't 
                         fit. They think the soul of a woman 
                         is darker than a back alley... more 
                         tangled than a telephone cord... and 
                         colder than a Klondike Bar in Canada. 
                         But those guys don't even have a 
                         clue.

               She stops at the railing. We see an incredibly beautiful 
               face and cool, alluring eyes. This is LOLA CAIN. The term 
               "femme fatale" was coined for her. She's on display... and 
               knows it.NED (V.O.)When you know women the way I do, 
                         you understand exactly what what 
                         makes them tick... what makes them 
                         hum... what makes them jiggle up and 
                         down when they walk. And it's not 
                         the kind of thing you can learn from 
                         a correspondence course.

               The CAMERA MOVES with her as she walks on, passing TWO MEN 
               whose eyes are glued to her. We HOLD ON THEM.

               One is NED RAVINE, in his thirties, stalwart, handsome, hair 
               trimmed neatly, but with a feel of loose ends about him... 
               coat slung over his shoulder, sleeves rolled up, the sweat 
               dampening his shirt. He's a cop. A plain clothes detective 
               who's been around the block a few times and still gets lost.

               Next to him is ARCH, his partner. Older, if not in years, at 
               least in mileage. Dependable, solid, with no great aspirations 
               except to reach the end of a shift intact. He's eating Nachos 
               from a cardboard container, licking the cheese off his 
               fingers.

               The CAMERA PUSHES IN to NED. His eyes are fixed on Lola.ANGLE - LOLA - NED'S POVShe walks to the other side of the pier... as more paper 
               sticks to the gum on her shoe. She stands at the railing.NED (V.O.)There are two kinds of women in this 
                         world... and I've known 'em both.ANGLE - ARCHArch heaves an exasperated sigh and looks toward Ned. The 
               CAMERA PULLS BACK to INCLUDE NED. It isn't "voice-over" 
               narration at all. Ned is actually talking out loud.NED (V.O.)One will take you for a fast ride on 
                         a bumpy road with no seat belt. But 
                         the other kind...ARCH(interrupts)
                         Jeez... knock off the chatter, will 
                         ya.NEDJust trying to keep you awake, Arch.ARCHI'm awake! Where do you come up with 
                         all that crap about women?NEDIt's true. Women are very complex, 
                         but if you know how to read 'em... 
                         they're an open book. You can always 
                         tell the rotten apples from the 
                         peaches.ARCHAre you kiddin'?NEDI'd stake my career on it. Anybody 
                         ever proves me wrong, I'll throw 
                         away my badge.ARCHAayyhh... women are trouble...NEDI used to believe that too. Until I 
                         married Lana. Now, she... is a peach.ARCHYeah, well you're a lucky stiff, 
                         pal. Ya hold down two jobs. Got a 
                         beautiful wife waitin' for ya at 
                         home. Everything a guy could ever 
                         want, including NO kids.NEDI'd love to have kids.ARCHWhat?! Rug-rats? Give me a break!
                              (looks around)
                         Jeez, I hate stakeouts. What makes 
                         you think Milo's gonna show up here?NEDLogic. He knocked off all those banks. 
                         He's got cash. He's gonna want to 
                         spend it. This is one of the few 
                         places that still takes cash. Sooner 
                         or later... he's gotta turn up.ARCHAnd how we s'posed to recognize this 
                         scumbag?NEDThe "Support Hose Bandit"? When you 
                         see him... you'll know him.

               In the b.g., MILO CRUMLEY, the "Support Hose Bandit", ambles 
               by casually, unnoticed, sucking on a cherry Snow-Cone through 
               the panty-hose pulled down over his head.ARCHThese are the best damn Nachos in 
                         North America. Maybe the world!

               He pops the last chip in his mouth, licks his fingers and 
               turns the container over.ARCHI'm empty. I'm gonna get a refill. 
                         You want some?

               Ned shakes his head. Arch heads off to the Nacho stand. Ned 
               steps over to the railing... gazes out at the ocean.

               A SAXOPHONE begins to wail a scorching, romantic melody... a 
               recurrent tune that will come to be known as LOLA'S THEME.

               A beat later... Lola moves to Ned's side at the railing. He 
               tries to ignore her presence, peering into the darkness. 
               Lola digs in her purse for a pack of cigarettes.LOLAGot a light?NEDSure.

               Ned pulls out a small flashlight, shines it in her purse. 
               She pulls a cigarette out of the pack, puts it to her lips... 
               her eyes on Ned, sizing him up.LOLAHow about a match?NEDNo thanks. I have plenty.

               He pulls out a handful of matchbooks, shows her, then stuffs 
               them back in his pocket.

               He turns and walks along the pier. She falls into step beside 
               him, lighting her own cigarette. A saxophone player named 
               DIZZY follows behind them, continuing to play. He's the actual 
               source of the romantic THEME MUSIC we've been hearing.LOLAYou really are incredibly stupid, 
                         aren't you? I like that in a man.NEDI'd be insulted, but I know you're 
                         serious.LOLAYou sound so sure of yourself.NEDI'm not as dumb as I look.LOLALet me buy you a drink, Mr. uh...NEDRavine. Ned Ravine. And you are...?LOLAThirsty. What about that drink?NEDI'm on duty.LOLABrain surgeon?NEDCop.LOLAOooo... and I bet you have a big 
                         gun.NEDYou lose.

               Lola looks toward a nearby hot dog vendor.LOLAIf I can't buy you a drink...
                              (nods toward vendor)
                         ...let me buy you one of those.NEDWho can say no to a weiner?LOLANot me.

               Lola turns to the hot dog VENDOR, raising two fingers.LOLATwo dogs. Hot.

               She takes them... hands one to Ned. He picks up the plastic 
               mustard container to put mustard on her hot dog first.NEDYou come here often?LOLAOnly when I'm in heat.

               Ned REACTS to this, squeezing the container. A stream of 
               mustard squirts out, hitting the front of Lola's dress.NEDOh! Sorry.

               Flustered, he stuffs his hot dog into his inside jacket 
               pocket, then tries to wipe the mustard off Lola's dress, 
               smearing it all over her, making it worse. She watches him 
               with a cool, detached gaze as he fumbles ingenuously.

               Suddenly, Ned stops, looking off. He sees... Milo Crumley 
               going into the PUBLIC RESTROOM. Ned starts to leave. Lola 
               grabs his hand, holding it tightly against her breast.LOLAWhere ya going?NEDGet something to wipe it off.LOLAThat's okay. You're doing just fine.NEDI'll get you a wet paper towel.

               He heads for the men's room... signaling to Arch, who's 
               waiting in line at the Nacho stand. Arch motions at the long 
               line... all UNIFORMED COPS... shrugging helplessly.INT. MEN'S ROOM ON PIER - NIGHTSeveral MEN are at the urinals. Milo, still wearing the panty 
               hose over his head, washes his face at the sink. He looks 
               up, sees Ned enter. Ned sees Milo... reacts, pulling the 
               frankfurter out of his pocket and pointing it.NEDHold it right there, Milo!

               The Men turn, seeing Ned pointing the frankfurter.RESTROOM PATRONLook out! He's got a weenie!

               Milo bolts, slamming into Ned, knocking him back through the 
               door of a stall, into the lap of the MAN inside.EXT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHTMilo bursts out, colliding with Arch. They both go down in a 
               flurry of Nacho chips and cheese. Arch helps Milo to his 
               feet, apologizing profusely... picking up the gun that Milo 
               dropped, handing it back to him. Milo sprints off down the 
               pier.

               A beat later, Ned bursts out the door... dashing after Milo.ANGLE - ALONG THE PIERMilo runs frantically, knocking people aside! He ducks into...INT. BUMPER CAR PAVILION - NIGHT...and drags a FLUSTERED MAN out of a bumper car, jumps in, 
               and speeds away!

               A beat later, Ned runs up, followed by Arch. Ned flashes his 
               badge at a FRECKLE-FACED KID in one of the bumper cars.NEDPolice emergency! I need your car!

               He pulls the kid out, jumps in, slaps a portable FLASHING 
               RED LIGHT on the dashboard... then speeds off after Milo, a 
               SIREN WAILING! He zig-zags through the crush of other bumper 
               cars in the pavilion.

               Ned's bumper car catches up with Milo, pulling alongside. 
               Milo turns the wheel, RAMMING Ned! Ned RAMS him back, both 
               bumper cars swerving violently... spraying SPARKS!

               Ned SLAMS Milo's car again! Milo loses control, spins out 
               and SMASHES into the pavillion railing!

               Ned swerves to avoid a collision, but RAMS into two other 
               bumper cars, wrenching to a grinding halt. A BEAT. The AIRBAG 
               inflates in his bumper car.

               Arch runs up as Ned pulls himself from the wreckage. They 
               turn to see Milo leap from his mangled bumper car, leap over 
               the pavillion railing and dash down the pier and into an 
               alley between two buildings. A sign on the building says:DEAD END ALLEY.Ned and Arch eye each other, shake their heads, and follow 
               after Milo.OMITSequence omitted from original script.IN THE ALLEYMilo runs into a tall chain link fence at the end of the 
               alley and scrambles up the wire mesh. Suddenly, Ned's hand 
               shoots out, grabs Milo's ankle, yanking him down hard.

               Milo jumps to his feet, swinging at Ned, who catches Milo's 
               fist with his hand, stopping it cold... neatly snapping a 
               handcuff on his wrist. He shoves Milo's arm against the fence 
               and snaps the other cuff to the chainlink.

               A SWITCHBLADE flashes out of Milo's other hand with a sharp 
               CLICK! Milo slashes the blade at Ned, just missing his face. 
               On the backswing, Ned parries with his own switchblade and 
               flips Milo's knife away.

               Milo pulls a .45 Calibre REVOLVER with his free hand! Ned 
               shoves his finger into the end of the barrel. Milo looks 
               surprised... then sneers, clicking the hammer back.NEDYou take science in high school, 
                         Milo?MILOI skipped high school, cop!NEDThen you're probably not familiar 
                         with the theory of inverse 
                         proportionate explosive dynamics.MILOWhat about it?NEDIf you fire a weapon with the barrel 
                         obstructed, the explosive force 
                         multiplies by twenty-three point 
                         five nine eight and reverses on itself 
                         with diametric polarity?MILOYeah. So?NEDThe gun will blow up in your hand... 
                         and it won't even scorch my pinkie.MILOHa! That's just theoretical 
                         hypothesis. Inverse proportionate 
                         explosive dynamics has never been 
                         demonstrated conclusively in a 
                         laboratory environment.NEDOh yeah. Then pull the trigger, smart 
                         guy. Let's find out.

               Milo hesitates, unsure. Finally, he releases the gun. Ned 
               raises it up on the end of his finger. Arch pulls it off 
               with a loud POP!

               Ned cuffs Milo's hands behind him... spins him around.NEDYou have the right to remain silent...

                         can do... with a bobbie pin.

               Ned looks at the door. The frame and lock have been brutally 
               chewed away, as if someone used a jackhammer on them! She

               The "handshake" between Lola and Laura turns tense, then 
               aggressive, eventually becoming a "standing Indian wrestle"

               Laura lands on the couch... upside down... gasping. Lola 
               strikes a haughty pose, still holding her lit cigarette. She 
               takes a drag. Laura checks her watch, then tumbles off the

               reluctantly toward the door, sees the lock and door frame

               They pass a feeble OLD WOMAN struggling to drag a HUGE STEAMER 
               TRUNK along the platform... inches at a time. A REDCAP passes 
               her also, carrying a small overnight case for an attractive, 
               elegantly attired SOCIALITE. Everyone ignores the Old Woman.

               He adjusts the Silencer Volume Control, which has a scale 
               from 1 thru 11. He turns it all the way down to "0"... DEAD

               Frank and Lana. Their eyes widen. Suddenly, a stream of water

               Frank gets up, moves down the aisle slowly, eyes on Ned. He 
               can't squeeze past the Old Woman, who is still struggling to 
               pull her huge trunk down aisle. So... he climbs right over 
               the top of it... oblivious to her.

               Frank stares at Ned warily as he gets closer. Suddenly, Jeff 
               squirts a stream of water in Ned's eyes. Frank sees his

               A beat. Ned realizes he's right. Acting tough, he pulls the 
               plug and drains the water out of the gun, then tosses it 
               back to Jeff.

               Without missing a beat, Jeff drops the empty water magazine 
               from the grip and jams a full one in... just like loading a 
               cartridge clip. He smirks, ready for action.

               In the aisle next to them, the Old Woman now pulls her trunk 
               back toward the vestibule. Jeff points the squirt gun at
