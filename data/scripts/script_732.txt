 Fourth draft (1991)
 Screenplay by James Baldwin, Arnold Perl and Spike Lee
 Based on The Autobiography of Malcolm X as told to Alex HaleyFADE IN:1  	EXT. ROXBURY STREET - THE WAR YEARS - DAYIt is a bright sunny day on a crowded street on the black side of 
	Boston. PEOPLE and KIDS are busy with their own things. 

	SHORTY bops his way down the street. He is a runty, very dark 
	young man of 21 with a mission and a smile on his face. He wears 
	the flamboyant style of the time: the whole zoot-suit, pegged legs 
	and a wide brim hat with a white feather stuck in the hat band.2 	OMIT3 	OMIT4 	OMIT5 	EXT. STREET - DAYFOLLOW SHOT. Shorty dodges through the crowd with his packages. 
	His smile is one of anticipation. He nods to a PAL without 
	stopping; eyes a COUPLE OF CHICKS dancing on the street, but is 
	not dissuaded.6	INT. BARBER SHOP - DAYShorty has his jacket and hat off, his sleeves rolled up. He is like a 
	surgeon preparing for an operation. His equipment is spread out on 
	a table: can of lye, large mason jar, wooden stirring spoon, knife, 
	the eggs. His actions have the character of a ritual: each thing 
	being done just so, in time-honored fashion.

	He slices the potatoes and drops the thin slices into the mason jar.
	He adds water and makes a paste of the starch.

	Behind Shorty is a spirited barbershop conversation. ONE MAN is
 	getting a haircut; TWO OTHERS are watching (TOOMER, JASON)
	one of them from behind a newspaper. A middle-aged barber, 
	CHOLLY, is doing most of the talking.CHOLLYAfter I hit the number that woman wasn't no good 
		to me at all.The men laugh.ANGLE - Shorty pries open the can of lye, whiffs it. It's good and 
	strong. He pours some in the mason jar, stirring with the wooden 
	spoon. He cracks the eggs into the mixture and stirs. He waits as 
	fumes rise and feels the outside of the jar as it gets hot.ANOTHER ANGLE - The barbershop SEEN from a door, slightly 
	ajar. A woolly head, entirely in shadow, peers out.CHOLLY'S VOICEShe says I'm cheap cuz I won't cop her a diamond 
		ring. Had the indignation to call me a cheap 
		black sunovabitch to boot.TOOMERAnd when a black woman call you a cheap black 
		sunovabitch you've been called a cheap black 
		sunovabitch.Cholly is annoyed. It's _his_ story.CHOLLYWill you let me tell it?

	ON SHORTY - He opens the bulky package he has been carrying, 
	unfolds a large rubber apron and gets into it. Now he dons a pair of
 	rubber gloves.SHORTYWhere's Homeboy?

	He is all ready; one of his hands is filled with a huge glob of 
	Vaseline. His manner is indignant as if he were asking the whereabouts 
	of an exasperating child.CHOLLYRed's in the head, man.TOOMERYou mean hiding in the head.CHOLLYHey, Red. Your man's here and waiting on you. 

	His hands full, Cholly opens the door with his feet and MALCOLM comes 
	out, a big, gawky, bright-faced country boy, wearing downhome clothes 
	and an expression of apprehension.TOOMERGonna get that first conk laid on, hunh, 
		Homeboy?CHOLLYMan, don't scare him more than he's scared 
		already. Ain't too bad...Malcolm allows himself to be led to an empty chair, where Cholly drapes 
	him with a double sheet, tucking it tightly around his neck and adding 
	a protective collar of paper.CHOLLY...Like anything else. First time a chick gets her 
	cherry popped, she might put up a little fight. But 
	pretty soon you can't give her enough. Right, 
	Homeboy?CLOSE - MALCOLMMalcolm gulps, his eyes on the fuming mason jar. 

	Shorty starts massaging a great quantity of Vaseline into Malcolm's 
	scalp, covering his neck and ears as well. All the men have gathered
 	around, involved in the ritual. For Malcolm it is closer to being a 
	kind of execution.CHOLLYGit his forehead and eyebrows.SHORTYI know what I'm doing.Shorty applies the Vaseline to that area.  Now he brings over the
	steaming jar and places it nearby.

				SHORTY (contd)
 		Listen. You pull my coat if it's still stinging 
		when I get through 'cause this shit can burn a 
		hole through cement.CHOLLYHold tight, baby, and keep your eyes shut.Malcolm nods his head, clenches his eyes and grits his teeth. Shorty 
	applies the congolene with a comb, working it into Malcolm's hair.CLOSE - MALCOLMMALCOLMI thought you said it was gonna sting... this 
		ain't nothin'.For a moment nothing happens, then the heat hits him. He yells, tries 
	to catch his breath: his head is on fire.MALCOLM (contd)
		You motherfucker.  You're killing me. I'm 
		burning up. My damn head is on fire.

	He nearly leaps out of the chair, but the barber restrains him.

	Shorty, utterly unmoved by the outburst, continues working the 
	congolene into his hair. 

	Malcolm breaks out of the chair wildly. But the three men drag him to a 
	basin where Shorty has attached the shower spray. His cries filling the 
	room, Malcolm is ducked under the spray. Shorty starts rinsing out his 
	hair.SHORTYDon't fight me, man. Let me git it out.Malcolm is a little relieved, he tentatively opens his eyes, then he 
	feels the congolene again and there is another outburst. Shorty forces 
	his head under the spray, spurts the water all over his head, wetting 
	Malcolm and the shop in the process.7	OMIT8 	OMIT9  	INT. CLOTHING STORE - DAYSHORTYWell, Homeboy, you almost there. Turn around.Shorty is supervising as Malcolm tries on a zoot suit. He slips into 
	the jacket...Shoes-off, Malcolm steps into the tight-fltting peg-legged pants ......
 	dons a wide-brimmed hat with a bright blue feather.... Finally, fully 
	outfitted, he leans forward toward his new image in the full-length 
	mirror, twirling a long, dangling key chain.SHORTYWell, all right, then.MALCOLMWell, all reet, then.The transformation is complete. The two laugh and slap hands.10	EXT. ROXBURY STREET - DAYMalcolm and Shorty come strutting down the street: two conked,
	zoot-suited sharpies. Hometown boy has departed. And the CHICKS on the 
	street notice them, especially Malcolm, the taller of the two, the 
	lighter-skinned, the more dominant. They walk imperiously past, fully 
	aware of their impact.CLOSE SHOT - MALCOLMFREEZE FRAME. He becomes a STILL.VOICE OF MALCOLM XWhen my mother was pregnant with me, she told

	as LIONEL HAMPTON and his band is killing. The music is WILD, the
 	dancing is frantic, the clothes are OUT, and the crowd is predominately 
	BLACK, although there is a peppering of WHITES, especially white chicks.
 	And Malcolm is a little bug-eyed as he nudges Shorty, watching mixed 
	couples on the floor. 

	A BOY in extreme zoot-suit flips him; a WHITE GIRL in long blond
	hair wigs him. Malcolm is a little open-mouthed.A VOICESHOWTIME, SHOWTIME!ANGLE - THE BALLROOM - NIGHTPeople start moving off the floor, making room for the dancers. The 
	music begins to get faster and more furious.CLOSE - HAMPTON'S BAND - NIGHTIt is a fast Lindy. People start clapping to the beat as they form a U 
	around the DANCERS, with the band at the open end.16 	INT. THE DANCE FLOORTWO COUPLES are on the floor, dancing wildly. They are quickly joined 
	by a half dozen OTHERS. These are the best dancers and constitute the 
	main event of a Saturday night black dance. People crowd and push to 
	get better vantage points and the competition is under way.ANGLE ON THE CROWDIt is dominantly black, but there are some whites in the audience, 
	mostly women. One is SOPHIA, a spectacular blonde with a degree of
 	refinement, something of a thrill-seeker. Many of the men try to catch 
	her eye, but for the moment Sophia is just watching, looking for no one 
	in particular, but nonetheless looking.ANGLE: - COUPLE ON THE DANCE FLOORGetting ready to enter the fray, the GIRL takes off her shoes and 
	bounces out on the floor barefoot with her partner. Their advent is 
	greeted with cheers and ad libs. Clearly the crowd has its favorites.WIDER SHOTThe music gets faster and the dancing takes on a more frantic and more 
	remarkable quality.FOLLOW SHOT - MALCOLMHe is looking for his partner, the girl he brought and now he sees her. 
	He makes his way through the watching audience.CLOSE - LAURAShe is a fine chick, cool and beautiful. She smiles as she sees Malcolm 
	approaching.

	TWO-SHOT. Laura and Malcolm stand together, delighted to be with one 
	another, starting to move to the music, as they watch the dancers.MALCOLMCome on, baby, let's show 'em how.Laura smiles shyly; she's willing.MALCOLM (contd) 
		You better get out of them shoes, girl.Laura laughs, goes quickly to a bench and changes into a pair of 
	sneakers.17 	INT. THE DANCE FLOORBecause of the competition, Laura and Malcolm begin at high speed. In a 
	moment they are executing the most intricate steps of the "flapping 
	eagle" and the "kangaroo." Malcolm starts boosting her over and around 
	his hips, then boosting her over his shoulders. Laura is the perfect 
	partner. She loves it.ANGLE WITH THE CROWDSo does the crowd, who loves new stars. There are ad lib remarks: "Go,
 	man, go." "Hey, Red." "Mmmmmm ummm."ANGLE: - SHORTYA big, fat, hefty BLACK WOMAN takes Shorty out to the dance floor, and 
	she takes the lead. As they do the Lindy she is slinging Shorty around 
	like a rag doll. This woman slides him through her legs and Shorty has 
	had enough, he runs off the dance floor, and hides.TWO-SHOT. Laura and Malcolm are, in the phrase, cooking on all burners 
	now; and when they execute an especially intricate step, even Hamp 
	waves over.Malcolm is sweating and flushed and enormously elated. He sees that 
	people are watching him, goading him on. He notices that Sophia, in 
	particular, has not taken her eyes off him; she is clapping in time to 
	his steps.Seeing new stars in the making, the other dancers move to the side of 
	the floor, marking time, yielding the dance floor to them. Laura and 
	Malcolm go into a solo.ANGLESThe crowd loves it. Malcolm and Sophia are very aware of each other. 
	The finale is the classic drag, with Laura hanging limp around 
	Malcolm's neck as he capers off the dance floor to the spontaneous 
	applause of the audience.CLOSE SHOT - SOPHIA (SLO-MO)Clapping enthusiastically -- in open admiration.CLOSE SHOT - SHORTYWaiting to catch them as they come off. Shorty is whistling and shaking 
	his hand appreciatively. He is also looking out for his dance partner.SHORTYHey, man, gimme some skin.MALCOLMShorty, this is Laura.Laura is flushed and out of breath and joyous.LAURA'Lo. I've got to freshen up.MALCOLMNow you come back.Laura laughs as she goes. She surely will be back.SHORTYThat's a fine chick.MALCOLMFine as May wine.SHORTYExcept she live on the hill and got a grandma.MALCOLMMake it too easy and it ain't no fun.Then his vision catches Sophia, who is approaching him. She makes a 
	simple, direct gesture, "Want to dance?" Malcolm eyes Shorty and 
	wordlessly glides into Sophia's arms.ANGLE - THE DANCE FLOORImmediately from the glances of the other men at the dance, he is the 
	cynosure of all eyes. He has new status. It's a heady feeling because 
	she is the first white girl he has ever been with socially who is not 
	an obvious whore. He begins to show off a little, cuts a few fine 
	steps.TWO-SHOT. They are dancing closer than before. Sophia begins to rock 
	his black world.CLOSE - MALCOLMTrying to play it cool -- but he is beginning to pant. Not from the 
	dancing, but from the situation: a gorgeous white chick asking for
 	it.SOPHIAWhy don't you take your little girl home, Red, 
		and come on back?He stops in his tracks. He can't believe it.SOPHIA (contd) 
		Just walk. Don't run. It'll be here when you 
		get back. 

	He can only grin.18	EXT. LAURA'S HOUSE - ROXBURY - NIGHTThe porch of a respectable house. Malcolm with Laura; he anxious to get 
	away.MALCOLMI better not come in.LAURAI ain't stupid.MALCOLMI mean it's late, baby.LAURAI know where you're going.MALCOLMI'm going to bed. I gotta work tomorrow, need 
		my rest.Laura walks to the door.MALCOLM (contd) 
		Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.LAURAWhat for? I ain't white and I don't put out. 

	The front door opens, it's Laura's grandmother, MRS. JOHNSON.MALCOLM'Night, Mrs. Johnson.He runs down the porch steps.19	INT. SOPHIA'S CAR - NIGHTThe lone light emits from the car radio which plays The Inkspots' "IF IDIDN'T CARE."ANGLE - SOPHIASophia pulls her tight sweater over her head to expose two full ripe 
	white breasts. Malcolm's eyes are popping out of his head. NOTE: It's 
	very unusual for women not to wear a bra back in that day but you might 
	say Sophia was way ahead of her time.SOPHIAMalcolm, look at them. Have you ever seen white 
		breasts like these?CLOSE - MALCOLMHe shakes his head.SOPHIA (contd) 
		Put your black hands on them.He is paralyzed.

				SOPHIA (contd) 
		Please do as I say.Malcolm mumbles something. He then kisses Sophia as if his black life 
	depended on it and he commences to kill it.SOPHIA (contd) 
		Hey, baby.She stops him for a moment, but he buries his head in her long neck.SOPHIA (contd) 
		Am I the first white woman you've been with? 

	She already knows the answer. He laughs.MALCOLMSheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty.SOPHIA...That isn't a whore?

	Knowing she's right, Sophia becomes the aggressor. 

	A beat -- both panting -- then Malcolm stops abruptly. He raises his 
	hand to his face, then to Sophia's hand which is still caressing him.SOPHIAThat's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's 
		not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't 
		run.MALCOLMShhhh! I don't like women that talk.CLOSE - SOPHIAShe shrugs, then moves to embrace him.SOPHIAWho wants to talk?

BOSTON COMMONS - DAYA bright, sunny day, long shadows in the park. The Commons is almost 
	empty. Two improbable zoot-suited blacks race past trees, and run over 
	the grass. Malcolm and Shorty are playing Cops and Robbers while 
	PASSERSBY stare.SHORTYBang, bang. You're dead.MALCOLMNaw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for 
		size. 

	Malcolm fires an imaginary tommy machine gun at Shorty.SHORTYI forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof 
		vest.MALCOLMThe hell you are.SHORTYI'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna 
		be Bogart sometimes.MALCOLMYou're too small to be Bogart.SHORTYI'm not too short to be Cagney.Shorty shoots Malcolm from behind.SHORTY (contd) 
		Pow. Take that.Malcolm acts as if he's been hit.MALCOLMAhhh! You got me, you dirty, filthy, rotten, 
		stinking copper, only a low-down yellow rat 
		bastard would shoot a man in the back.Malcolm starts to stagger, this is a long drawn out Hollywood drawn-out

	previous scene. His mouth opens in terror as the moving trolley comes 
	closer and closer to the black man lying on the tracks.27 	INT. A HEARING ROOM - DAYA room, clinically empty; table, chair, and MR. HOLWAY. He is putting 
	papers into his briefcase; the hearing is concluded.LOUISEWhat you mean took his own life?!HOLWAYI'm sorry, ma'am. You heard the verdict. A man 
		bash in the back of his head with a hammer, lay

	She starts to sit down on the bed next to him.

	She spoons some into his mouth. He chews and swallows slowly, then 
	grabs her head and brings it to his. A long, brutal kiss. Then he pulls

	white, one black, slowly walk past the P.M. check. 

	The procedure is routine, done without emotion, as it is done three

	prisoner answers with his number, then steps into his cell. Whereupon 
	the white guard slams the door shut and locks it.GUARD WILKINSJackson.PRISONERA 231549.Door is slammed and gate locked.CLOSE - MALCOLMEach time a gate is locked his tension increases. His face is a mask

	PRISONERS who have been watching Malcolm during the scene. They whisper 
	surreptitiously without moving their bodies, and barely moving their 
	lips. One of the prisoners is PETE, a huge barrel of a man, a lifer --
	beaten by the system and a lifetime of incarceration. The other is 
	BEMBRY, a man of no great physicality, but who possesses immediately 
	the gift of leadership. It is clear that Pete and others look up to him 
	with great respect.PETELooka Satan.BEMBRYI see him.Bembry's language is very unhip. He speaks carefully. He respects words

	for a conk: lye, Vaseline, comb, etc.He turns for a moment as he sees he is being watched by someone. It's 
	Bembry standing nearby. Malcolm turns away, trying to find solace in 
	the water. He wants no part of the world or anyone, just to be left 
	alone.BEMBRYI know how you feel. Like you want to lay down 
		and die.Malcolm shows no flicker of interest or understanding.BEMBRY (contd) 
		I brought you something.He puts down a small matchbox on the bench next to Malcolm's things. 
	Malcolm eyes him like a snake -- but the punishment has reduced him to 
	deep insecurity and his belligerence is more cautious than angry.MALCOLMWho the hell are you?BEMBRYPut it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.MALCOLMMan, what do you want?BEMBRYYou need something. It's not a reefer, but 
		it'll help some.MALCOLMMan, get outa my face. I ain't nobody's punk.But he steps out of the shower, fills a tin cup with water and empties 
	the contents of the matchbox into it. And drinks it down quickly.BEMBRYSit down or it might knock you down.Malcolm sits, toweling himself as the spice hits him. For the first, he

	saying.BEMBRYI think you got more sense than any cat in this 
		prison. How come you are such a fool?Malcolm looks over, piqued.BEMBRY (contd) 
		Nobody can bust out like Bogart does it, in the

	Bembry restrains him, holding his arm.MALCOLMLeggo. I got to wash it out.BEMBRYLet it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.But it is burning now.MALCOLMMan, you better get off me.He wrenches away from Bembry and puts his head in the water.BEMBRYSure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all

	has said disturbs him.MALCOLMWho are you?Malcolm is completely humiliated. Bembry sees this and stops the 
	barrage.BEMBRYThe question is, who are you? You are in the 
		darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah 
		Muhammad can bring you into the light.MALCOLMElijah who?BEMBRYElijah Muhammad can get you out of prison. Out

		supremacy try and hide their own guilt by 
		accusing the Honorable Elijah Muhammad of 
		teaching black supremacy when he tries to 
		uplift the mentality, the social, and economic 
		condition of black people in this country. And 
		the Jews, who have been guilty of exploiting 
		the black people economically, civilly, and 
		otherwise, hide their guilt by accusing the 
		Honorable Elijah Muhammad of being anti-Semitic 
		simply because he teaches our people to go into 
		business for ourselves and trying to take over 
		the economic leadership in our own community. 
		The black people in this country have been the 
		victims of violence at the hands of the white 
		man for 400 years, and following the ignorant 
		Negro preachers, we have thought that it was 
		God-like to turn the other cheek to the brute 
		that was brutalizing us. 100 years ago they 
		use to put on a white sheet and use a 
		bloodhound against Negroes. Today they've taken
		off sheets and put on police uniforms, they've 
		traded in the bloodhounds for police dogs. And 
		just as Uncle Tom back during slavery used to 
		keep the Negroes from resisting the bloodhounds 
		or resisting the Ku Klux Klan by telling them 
		to love their enemy or pray for those who use 
		them as spitefully today. The Honorable Elijah 
		Muhammad is showing black people that just as 
		the white man and every other person on this 
		earth has God given rights, natural rights, 
		civil rights, and any other kind of rights that 
		you can think of when it comes to defending

		And I'm not finished. To understand this man--He points a sharp finger at the Negro Panelist.MALCOLM (contd) 
		--you must know that historically there are two 
		kinds of slaves. House Negroes and Field 
		Negroes. The house Negro lived in the big 
		house; he dressed pretty good; he ate pretty 
		good and he loved the master. Yeah, he loved 
		him more than the master loved himself. If the 
		master's house caught fire, he'd be the first 
		to put the blaze out. If the master got sick, 
		he'd say: "What's a matter, boss; we sick?" 
		WE sick! If someone said to him, "Let's run 
		away and escape. Let's separate." He'd say, 
		"Man, are you crazy? What's better than what I 
		got here?" That was the House Negro. In those

		hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; 
		he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and

	Sidney notices this from his father, but makes no comment.MALCOLM/HIS VOICEThe Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that 
		God is now about to establish a kingdom on this 
		earth based on brotherhood and[...]against peace, his history on this earth has 
		proved that. Nowhere in history has he been 
		brotherly toward anyone. The only time he has 
		been brotherly toward you is when he can use 
		you, when he can exploit you, when he can 
		oppress you, when you will submit to him. And 
		since his own history makes him unqualified to 
		be an inhabitant or a citizen in a kingdom of 
		brotherhood, the Honorable Elijah Muhammad 
		teaches us that God is about to eliminate that 
		particular race from this earth. So since they 
		are due for elimination, we don't want to be 
		with them.ANGLE - CROWDCLOSE - MALCOLMMALCOLM (contd) 
		If the so-called Negro were American citizens

		14th, and 15th amendments to the Constitution 
		was authentic, you wouldn't have a race 
		problem. If the Supreme Court desegregation 
		decision was authentic, you wouldn't have a

		Negro leaders have been telling the white man 
		everything is all right, everything is under 
		control. And they've been telling the white man 
		that Mr. Muhammad is wrong, don't listen to 
		him. But everything Mr. Muhammad has been

		year on the racial front, and because I myself 
		intend to be very active in every phase of the 
		American Negro struggle for HUMAN RIGHTS, I 
		have called this press conference, this 
		morning in order to clarify my own position in 
		the struggle -- especially in regards to 
		politics and nonviolence. In the past I thought 
		the thoughts, spoke the words of the Honorable 
		Elijah Muhammad, that day is over. From now on 
		I speak my own words, and think my own thoughts. 
		Internal differences within the Nation of Islam 
		forced me out of it. I did not leave of my own 
		free will. But now that it has happened, I 
		intend to make the most of it. Now that I have 
		more independence of action, I intend to use a 
		more flexible approach toward working with 
		others to get a solution to this problem. I do 
		not pretend to be a divine man, but I do 
		believe in divine guidance, divine power, and 
		in the fulfillment of divine prophecy. I am not 
		educated, nor am I an expert in any particular 
		field, but I am sincere, and my sincerity is my 
		credentials. I'm not out to fight other Negro 
		leaders or organizations. We must find a common 
		solution, to a common problem. I am going to 
		organize and head a new mosque in New York 
		City, known as the Muslim Mosque, Inc. This 
		gives us a religious base, and the spiritual 
		force necessary to rid our people of the vices 
		that destroy the moral fiber of our community. 
		Our political philosophy will be black 
		nationalism. Our economic and social philosophy 
		will be black nationalism. The Muslim Mosque, 
		Inc. will remain wide open for ideas and 
		financial aid from all quarters. Whites can 
		help us, but they can't join us. There can be 
		no black-white unity until there is first some 
		black unity.

		sentence anyone who has not been proven guilty. 
		I'm not a racist and do not subscribe to any of

		sensed a feeling of great brotherhood.MALCOLMAs I recall, I pointed out that while I was in 
		Mecca making the pilgrimage, I spoke about the 
		brotherhood that existed at all levels among 
		all people, all colors who had accepted the 
		religion of Islam. I pointed out that what it 
		had done, Islam, for those people despite their 
		complexion differences, that it would probably 
		do America well to study the religion of Islam 
		and perhaps it could drive some of the racism 
		from this society. Muslims look upon themselves 
		as human beings, as part of the human family 
		and therefore look upon all other segments of 
		the human family as part of that same family. 
		Today my friends are black, brown, red, yellow 
		and white.REPORTER #8Malcolm, are you prepared to go to the United 
		Nations at this point and ask that charges be

		The audience will have to be quiet. Yes, as I 
		pointed out that during my trip that nations, 
		African nations, Asian, Latin nations look very 
		hypocritical when they stand up in the UN 
		condemning South Africa and saying nothing 
		about the racist practices that are manifested 
		everyday against Negroes in this society. I 
		would be not a man if I didn't do so. I 
		wouldn't be a man.REPORTER #3Are you prepared to work with some of the

		organizations or leaders in any way, as long as 
		it's genuinely designed to get results.REPORTER #1Does the new beard have any religious 
		significance?MALCOLMNo, not particularly. But I do think that you 
		will And black people in America, as they 
		strive to throw off the shackles of mental 
		colonialism, will also probably reflect an 
		effort to throw off the shackles of cultural 
		colonialism. And then they'll begin to reflect 
		desires of their own with standards of their 
		own.REPORTER #2One of your more controversial remarks was a 
		call for black people to get rifles and form 
		rifle clubs sometime back. Do you still favor 
		that for self-defense?MALCOLMI don't see why that should be controversial. I 
		think that if white people found themselves 
		victim of the same kind of brutality that black 
		people in this country face, and they saw that 
		the government was either unwilling or unable 
		to protect them, that the intelligence on the 
		part of the whites would make them get some 
		rifles and protect themselves.REPORTER #2What about the guns, Malcolm?MALCOLMHas the white man changed since I went away?

		us forever.200C 	DOLLY SHOT of the long line of people outside the funeral parlor, 
	waiting to see Malcolm's body, where it lies before burial.OSSIE DAVIS'S VOICE: (contd) 
		For Harlem is where he worked, and where he 
		struggled and fought. His home of homes, where 
		his heart was and where his people are. And it 
		is therefore most fitting that we meet once 
		again in Harlem to share these last moments 
		with him. For Harlem has ever been gracious to 
		those who loved her, have fought for her and 
		defended her honor even to death. It is not in 
		the memory of man that this beleaguered, 
		unfortunate but nonetheless proud community has 
		found a braver, more gallant young champion 
		than this Afro-American who lies before us 
		unconquered still. Many will ask what Harlem 
		finds to honor in this stormy, controversial 
		and bold young captain and we will smile and we 
		will answer and say unto them:2OOD  SHOTS - FACES OF HARLEM - PRESENT DAY - THE 90'SOrdinary PEOPLE in ordinary pursuits of life, BLACK PEOPLE still
