          "...she gave to my family a fidelity without stint or
          calculation or recompense and gave to my childhood an
          immeasurable devotion and love".JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI 1963INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHTAIBILEEN, black, 53, sits at a table in a small, green
          kitchen. She wears a yellow dress with black piping and
          grips a tattered spiral notebook.
          Although cracked, the window behind her is crystal clear.
          Three framed portraits hang on the wall above her: John F.
          Kennedy, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and an UNKNOWN YOUNG
          BLACK MALE wearing thick glasses.
          Aibileen swallows hard.AIBILEENI was...born in 1911...on Piedmont
           Plantation in Cherokee County.
          An UNSEEN WOMAN interviews Aibileen.WOMAN (O.C.)Did you know as a girl, growing up,
           that one day you'd be a maid?AIBILEENYes, ma'am. I did.WOMAN (O.C.)And you knew that because?AIBILEENMomma was a maid. My grandmother
           was a house slave.WOMAN (0.C.)Oh.
          The woman repeats Aibileen's answer slowly as she writes.WOMAN (O.C.) (CONT'D)A...House...Slave. Uh-huh. Okay.
          Aibileen squeezes the notebook in her lap.WOMAN (O.C.) (CONT'D)Now, did you ever dream of being
           something else?
          Aibileen gulps. She doesn't answer. The room is quiet.WOMAN (O.C.) (CONT'D)Well then, what's it feel like, to
           raise a white child when your own
           child's at home...being looked
           after by somebody else?2.Aibileen's hand trembles as she sips from a glass of water.
          She glances sadly up to the picture of the young black male.FADE TO BLACK:AIBILEEN (V.O.)I done raised seventeen kids in my
           life. Lookin' after white babies,
           that's what I do.INT. LEEFOLT HOME - MAE MOBLEY'S ROOM - MORNINGMAE MOBLEY LEEFOLT, 2 1/2 years old, lies in a crib, crying.
          AIBILEEN enters. Her dark black skin contrasts angelically
          with a brilliant white work dress, white panty hose and shoesAIBILEEN (V.O.)I know how to get them babies
           asleep, stop cryin' and go in the
           toilet bowl before they mommas even
           get outta bed in the mornin.'
          Aibileen lifts Mae Mobley out of her crib and pulls her into
          her expansive bosom.AIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)Babies like fat. They like big fat
           legs too. That I know.
          Aibileen sits with Mae Mobley in a rocking chair.AIBILEEN (V.O) (CONT'D)I work from eight to four, six days
           a week. Ninety-five cents an hour
           comes to a hundred seventy-two
           dollars ever month. I do all the
           cooking, cleaning, washing, ironing
           and grocery shopping, but mostly, I
           take care a baby girl...And law, I
           worry she gone be fat. Ain't gonna
           be no beauty queen either.
          Mae Mobley reaches up and touches Aibileen's face. Aibileen
          kisses her and whispers in her ear.AIBILEEN (CONT'D)You is kind. You is smart. You is
           important.
          Mae Mobley's mother, ELIZABETH LEEFOLT, 21 and lanky, enters
          wearing a green dress very much under construction. Pins and
          double-stick tape hold it all together.
          Elizabeth has pointed features and a nest of teased, brittle
          hair.ELIZABETHAibileen, bridge club's in an hour!
           Did you finish the chicken salad?3.ELIZABETH (CONT'D)Oh, and Hilly's deviled eggs. No
           paprika!
          Elizabeth rotates around like the Tin Man.ELIZABETH (CONT'D)Does this dress look homemade?AIBILEENI reckon when you finish, it won't.
          Elizabeth exits with her pinned hemline sloping at a good
          twenty degree angle. Aibileen shakes her head.AIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)Miss Leefolt still don't pick Baby

          Skeeter has very frizzy blond hair cut short above her
          shoulders. She carries a red satchel.AIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)No babies...No man...And not

          She wears flats, careful not to add more than a centimeter to
          her towering height. Dressed well, Skeeter tugs on her
          unfamiliar attire.INT. MR. BLACKLY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUSThe receptionist and Skeeter enter the office of MR. HAROLD

          over, marking it violently with a red pen.MR. BLACKLY (CONT'D)"Murrah High Editor, Ole Miss Rebel

          Mr. Blackly sighs, hands the resum� back to Skeeter.MR. BLACKLYYou got any references?
          Skeeter nods slowly. She takes a deep breath and pulls a
          letter out of her satchel. She hands it to Mr. Blackly.
          Mr. Blackly snatches the letter and reads it quickly,
          mouthing the words as he does. He drops the letter on his
          desk, and looks to Skeeter, flabbergasted.MR. BLACKLY (CONT'D)That...is a rejection letter.
          Skeeter's face flushes hot and quick.SKEETERNot exactly. Missus Stein-MR. BLACKLY-STEIN?! Missus who?

          Mr. Blackly sees cigarette smoke bleeding under his door.MR. BLACKLYClean!
          Mr. Blackly pulls up a box filled with letters and
          newspapers. He slams it down in front of Skeeter.MR. BLACKLY (CONT'D)Miss Myrna's gone shit-house crazy

          seat in a well-appointed bathroom. She's covered in red plaid
          and bows and has a round face topped by a perfect beehive.HILLY(SCREAMING UPWARD)Momma! We're late for bridge!
          Hilly carefully rolls toilet paper out from its holder. She
          raises a pencil and places the tiniest dot imaginable on the
          first and second sheets of paper.AIBILEEN (V.O.)Miss Hilly was the first of the
           babies to have a baby. And it must
           a come out of her like the eleventh

           coming down?

          Missus Walters ambles toward the closet door. Minny quickly
          tries to turn her toward the front door. Missus Walters
          resists.MISSUS WALTERSMinny, I'm getting my coat.
          Missus Walters opens the closet.MINNYIt's ninety degrees out there,
           Missus Walters.
          Missus Walters pulls out a red, wool coat with cheetah print
          collar.
          The early stages of Alzheimer's have appeared, but Missus
          Walters is still quite proud at eighty percent capacity.AIBILEEN (V.O.)Once Missus Walters' arteries went
           hard, Miss Hilly moved her and
           Minny in with her. Fired the maid
           she had just to make room. See,
           Minny about the best cook in
           Mississippi, and Miss Hilly wanted
           her.
          Hilly's approach is marked by the whishing sound of her
          plaid, fat thighs.7.She nonchalantly grabs the coat from her mother and carries
          it out the door.
          Minny and Missus Walters follow. Minny carries a chocolate

           like me lucky to have her.INT. LEEFOLT HOME - BATHROOM- SAME DAYAibileen kneels next to Mae Mobley who sits on a small

          Aibileen and Mae Mobley laugh excitedly as Elizabeth storms

          Elizabeth reaches down and scoops up Mae Mobley like a sack
          of potatoes.
          Mae Mobley looks to Aibileen over her mother's shoulder, her
          eyes have welled up.
          Aibileen mouths "I love you" and blows her a kiss.INT. LEEFOLT HOME - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATERThe Leefolt's small, wood paneled, two bedroom "ranch" is

          FIVE YOUNG WOMEN, early 20s, and Elizabeth hover around two
          collapsible card tables arranged in the living room.
          Aibileen methodically arranges grapes on a platter of chicken
          salad resting on Elizabeth's dining table. The table has a
          small L-SHAPED CRACK in the middle.AIBILEEN (V.O.)I lost my own boy, Treelore, right
           before I started waitin' on the

          Hilly approaches Aibileen with the coat.HILLYAibileen, I want you to have this

          Aibileen slowly turns back to Skeeter.AIBILEENNo, ma'am. I couldn't...SKEETERDo you have an address for her or
           anything?
          Aibileen shrugs her shoulders, reeling it all back in.

          Skeeter looks in her rear view mirror, they're gone.

          truck's interior at a stubborn 115 degrees.
          Skeeter has no choice but to lower her window. The
          Shinolator meets its match.
          A mangy, STRAY CAT suddenly jumps out in the road. When
          towing 10,000 pounds of farm equipment, slowing down quickly
          isn't an option.61.A loud thud sounds out from the truck's grill.INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - PARLOR - LATER THAT NIGHTHilly, her husband, WILLIAM, and Skeeter's date, STUART
          WHITWORTH, drink high balls and eat cheese in the Holbrook
          parlor. Gold swag curtains hang on the windows.
          Balding and pudgy, only William's family money once made him
          a desirable bachelor. Stuart, on the other hand, is very
          handsome, the "Marlboro Man" in a well-tailored suit.
          Yule May (who we met earlier at church with Aibileen) now
          works for Hilly. She clears empty glasses.WILLIAMWith your daddy's endorsement, I
           can win that Senate seat.
          Stuart feigns interest.STUARTI'll talk to him.
          Ice slams against Stuart's teeth as he downs his drink.
          Hilly pats William's leg then turns with concern to a
          grandfather clock announcing half past the hour.
          The front door flies open. Skeeter enters completely out of
          breath and sweaty. Her HAIR HAS TRIPLED IN SIZE. She waves.SKEETERHey.
          As Hilly races toward Skeeter, William and Stuart stand.
          Stuart is as tall as he is handsome.HILLYBoys, we'll be right back. Y'all
           talk about quarterbacks or
           something. Yule May, get Miss

          the last of Skeeter's hair into giant rollers.HILLYSkeeter, you don't even have on

          Skeeter dabs her armpits.62.SKEETERIt was so goddamn awful. I hit a

          Hilly sprays Final Net.HILLYWell...What do you think of him?
          Skeeter applies lipstick. Hilly removes the rollers.SKEETERHe looks handsome.
          Skeeter stands up and does a twirl for Hilly.SKEETER (CONT'D)All right, give it to me. One to
           ten?
          Hilly sprays Skeeter with perfume and stands back.HILLYSeven.SKEETERReally?! Seven?
          Hilly nods, lets out a little squeal.HILLYHoney, you're beautiful. Just go
           on out there...you're gonna do
           great. It's your time, Skeeter. I

          adorned with white linens, silver and fine china.
          The room buzzes with Jackson's elite all trying to be noticed
          as a JAZZ QUARTET plays softly in a corner.
          A WAITER approaches. Stuart leans into Skeeter without
          making eye contact.STUARTYou want a drink?SKEETERJust water, please.STUART(TO WAITER)Double Old Kentucky straight...with
           a water back...Make that two backs.63.SKEETERTHANKS?! So...you went to Alabama?

           Hilly says you're a rigsite leader.STUARTThe money's good. If that's what
           you really want to know.SKEETERThat's not what I-
          Skeeter and Hilly watch as Stuart's and William's eyes fix on
          the front of the restaurant.
          Celia and Johnny have entered. Celia wears a tight green
          dress and the reddest lipstick ever put in a tube.STUARTIsn't that your old boyfriend,
           Hilly? Johnny Foote?
          Hilly scowls.STUART (CONT'D)Who's his girl? Lord, she's hotter
           than Delta asphalt.
          Celia spots Hilly and gives a self-conscious wave.HILLYWilliam! The Lieutenant Governor
           just walked in.
          Hilly jumps up and pulls William away. The waiter returns
          with Stuart's drink and the water backs.STUARTSo, what do you do with your time?SKEETERI write a...a domestic maintenance
           column for the Jackson Journal.
          Stuart smirks, taking a huge sip of his drink.STUARTYou mean housekeeping?
          Skeeter nods and grabs her water.64.STUART (CONT'D)Jesus, I can't think of anything
           worse than reading a cleaning

          William steps forward and shakes Celia's hand.WILLIAMNice to meet you.
          Hilly grabs the crook of William's arm.HILLYSweetie, we need to go order our
           dinners.

           husband...becoming an expert on
           keeping house.SKEETERWell, you must be a genius. You
           figured out my whole scheme.
          Skeeter fumes as Hilly and William return and sit.HILLYWhat'd we miss?STUARTIsn't that what you women from Ole
           Miss major in? Professional
           husband hunting?SKEETERI'm sorry, but were you dropped on
           your head as an infant?
          Stuart blinks and then smiles, somewhat impressed. Desperate
          to change the subject, Hilly claps her hands.HILLYWho? Is? Hungry?
          Skeeter stands.SKEETERNot me! A kiss from God couldn't
           turn this `frog' into a `prince.'
          Tables begin to stare.STUARTOr you a `princess,' Sweetheart!
          As Skeeter walks away, she purposefully slides her purse into
          a glass of water, knocking it over into Stuart's lap.INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - DINING ROOM - MORNINGHilly and William each have a section of newspaper in their
          face as Yule May clears breakfast dishes. Yule May lingers
          nervously.66.HILLYRun on, now, Yule May. Got a big
           crowd coming for Miss Leefolt's
           baby shower.YULE MAYMiss Hilly, I would like to ask you
           and Mister William something.
          Hilly lowers her paper and nods. Yule May begins wrenching
          her hands.YULE MAY (CONT'D)My twin boys finished high school,
           both on the honor roll...My husband
           and I have been saving for years to

          William leaves.HILLYGo on...YULE MAYNow...We're faced with having to
           choose. Which son gets to go...if
           we don't find all the money.
          Hilly draws in a deep breath as does Yule May.YULE MAY (CONT'D)Would you consider givin' us a
           loan? I'll...I'll work for free
           until it's paid off.HILLYThat's not working for free, Yule
           May. That's paying off a debt.YULE MAYYes, ma'am.HILLYAs a Christian, I'm going to do you
           a favor.
          Yule May's eyes widen as a hopeful smile forms.67.HILLY (CONT'D)God doesn't give charity to those
           who are well and able. You need to
           come up with this money on your
           own. You'll thank me one day.
          Hilly raises the paper up to her face as Yule May exits.INT. WHITE GROCERY STORE - LATER THAT MORNINGMinny and Aibileen, in uniform, push carts side by side in
          the grocery store. The white shoppers are dressed casually.
          Other maids in the store (all required to be in uniform while
          shopping) keep quietly to themselves.
          White women smile and chat with one another as they meander
          down the aisles as if the black maids aren't even there.
          Minny suddenly spots Celia in the produce section. She pulls
          Aibileen close as they peer around the corner.MINNYThat's her.
          Aibileen's mouth drops open at the sight of Celia's shorts
          and tight sweater. Celia is having trouble selecting
          produce.MINNY (CONT'D)Lord, she's trying to shop.
          Celia walks up to a maid, grabs her, and pulls her to the
          tomatoes. The maid, clearly uncomfortable, selects a tomato,
          hands it to Celia, and scurries away.CELIA(SHOUTS OUT)Thanks, Doll!MINNYMiss Celia just don't see `em. The
           lines. Not between us, Miss Hilly,
           nobody.

           philosophizing.MINNYI ain't afraid a no philosophy.68.AIBILEENI don't believe in lines anymore.
           Lines is in our heads `cause people
           like Miss Hilly try to make us
           believe they there.
          Celia squeezes a canteloupe with another scared maid.MINNYOh, they there. I know. I get
           punished for crossing them.EXT. BUS STOP - MOMENTS LATERAibileen and Minny continue their conversation while waiting
          with several other maids at a bus stop in front of the store.AIBILEENLotta of folk think if you talk
           back to your husband, you crossed a
           line...need to be punished.MINNYYou know I ain't studying no line
           like that.AIBILEENCause it ain't there. `Cept in
           Leroy's head. Lines between black
           and white ain't there either.
          Minny and Aibileen watch as Celia exits the store with her
          groceries and prances toward her car.MINNYSo, I ain't crossing no line if I
           tell Miss Celia she ain't good
           enough for Miss Hilly? Tell her
           she ain't in Miss Hilly's league?AIBILEENAll I'm saying is kindness don't
           have no boundaries.
          Just then, MYRLIE EVERS, 30, (Medgar Evers wife) approaches
          the bus stop with her three Children. SONS, 10 and 3, and aDAUGHTER, 8.Aibileen and Minny nod as the Evers walk past and sit on a
          bench.AIBILEEN (CONT'D)Law, the Evers children have gotten

           good man...And you better not try
           to say they ain't no line between
           her Medgar and my Leroy.69.AIBILEENNo. You got me.
          A bus pulls up and the doors open. Minny, Aibileen and the
          other maids step aside to let the Evers family board first.EXT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - BACK YARD - LATER THAT DAYAibileen has come along to aid Yule May with Elizabeth's baby
          shower.
          A table is set in the middle of the yard covered in white
          linens and Hilly's best sliver.
          Hilly's son sits on her lap. The other girls' children wear
          bathing suits jumping noisily in and out of two plastic kiddy
          pools.
          Yule May clears cake plates while Aibileen removes crumbs
          with a sterling crumb scraper.
          Mae Mobley wanders up to the table. Her belly almost looks
          distended crammed inside last year's one piece.MAE MOBLEYMae Mo hungry, Momma.
          Elizabeth turns to Mae Mobley but never gets up.ELIZABETHShe's always hungry.
          All the women laugh except for Skeeter.SKEETERYou know she can hear you,
           Elizabeth?
          Elizabeth looks down to her plate. Aibileen sets down the
          scraper and kneels down to Mae Mobley.AIBILEENI'm on cut you some cake, Baby.ELIZABETHAibileen, we gave that scraper to
           Hilly and William for their wedding
           present. Chantilly!AIBILEENIt so pretty.
          Hilly begins bouncing William Jr. on her knee.HILLYAibileen, are you enjoying your new
           bathroom over at Elizabeth's?
          Hilly nods with a tight smile and glances to the ground at
          Skeeter's red satchel.70.HILLY (CONT'D)Nice to have your own, isn't it?AIBILEENYes, ma'am.HILLYSeparate but equal. That's what
           Ross Barnett says, and you can't
           argue with the Governor.SKEETERNot in Mississippi. Birthplace of
           modern day government.
          Hilly narrows her eyes at Skeeter and turns to Aibileen.HILLYAibileen, did you know that me and
           Mister Holbrook arranged for that
           bathroom? Sent the boys over and
           the equipment, too.
          Hilly stays on Aibileen, waiting for her to say something.
          Skeeter fumes, hoping Aibileen doesn't say it.AIBILEENYes, ma'am...And I thank you.
          Hilly smiles and nods.HILLYWell...You. Are. Welcome.
          Hilly shoots Skeeter a last look. William Jr. leans into
          Hilly and hugs her.AIBILEEN (V.O.)One thing I got to say about Miss
           Hilly, she love her children.
           Always tellin' them they smart and
           beautiful. Can't go more than ten
           minutes without givin' one a kiss.
          Hilly kisses her son gently.AIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)And, law, do they love her back.
           When she starts up on me, I just
           try and think a my sweet Treelore
           and how much he loved me. That
           kind a love makes me cry. Even
           when it going to Miss Hilly.
          Hilly again glances to the red satchel, staring quizzically
          at the worn booklet of The Jim Crow laws sticking out.INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER THAT DAYYule May washes dishes as the women are heard saying their
          "good-byes" on the street. Skeeter slips into the kitchen.71.YULE MAYMay I get you something?SKEETERNo, thanks...(HUSHED)Yule May, I wanted to talk to you.
          Yule May turns off the sink faucet making sure Hilly is still
          cackling out on the street.YULE MAYI know what you want to ask, Miss
           Skeeter. Aibileen and Minny
           already did.
          Yule May closes the kitchen door.YULE MAY (CONT'D)I'm trying to get my boys off to
           college. It's worthwhile what
           y'all doing, but my boys are worth

           was in the neighborhood and thought
           I'd drop by.
          The girls giggle more loudly now. Celia peers into the
          living room window.
          The bridge tables are in plain view. Celia's face grows
          pinker than her sweater.CELIA (CONT'D)I...brought you a chocolate

           vacuum man. Why, Minny?
          Minny freezes, keeping her face on the peas.MINNYBecause they know about you getting

          Celia rises and smiles like she just cured cancer.MINNYNow, Miss Celia...please don't be
           going to that benefit.
          Celia gets some ice out of the fridge.MINNY (CONT'D)Did you hear what I said?
          Celia places the ice in a towel and approaches Minny. She

          Skeeter closes her eyes for moment.
          When she opens them she sees A VISION OF CONSTANTINE STANDINGBEFORE HER.Constantine smiles and grabs Skeeter's hand. She presses her
          thumb firmly in her palm. When Skeeter blinks again, the
          vision is gone.
          Standing in place of Constantine is GRETCHEN, 26.GRETCHENAll these colored women have been
           real nice, haven't they?SKEETERYes. Very nice.GRETCHENWell, they hate you. You know

          As Skeeter writes this down, someone walks onto Aibileen's
          front porch. Skeeter becomes worried. Aibileen looks to a
          wall clock and smiles.
          About a dozen letters and cards fall into a basket under the
          mail slot.
          Aibileen jumps up and starts sorting through the cards.AIBILEEN (CONT'D)Today my birthday, Miss Skeeter.SKEETERWell, happy birthday, Aibileen.

          next to Skeeter.AIBILEEN (CONT'D)Some even from overseas. Alton

           Birthday. Love Alton.
          Aibileen laughs and raises her hand to her mouth. Skeeter is
          touched.
          The doorbell rings. Aibileen jumps up and opens the door. A
          delivery man greets her with two more vases of flowers.
          Aibileen looks out to the street where a white woman gets out
          of her car with a huge country ham. Two little girls in
          matching dresses jump out behind her.
          The woman sees Aibileen on the porch and waves. Aibileen
          waves back and smiles.
          Catching it all, the moment soon grows bittersweet for
          Skeeter. She wipes her eye.INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - SKEETER'S BEDROOM - 3 WEEKS LATERMorning light shines into Skeeter's room. Stuart has

          Skeeter's eyes pop open. She's groggy and hasn't fully
          realized the company lying next to her.SKEETERWhat?!
          Stuart throws his arm over Skeeter. Reality sinks in.
          Skeeter rolls over to find Stuart, eyes shut, smiling.SKEETER (CONT'D)Oh my God! Oh my God!
          When Stuart tries to get up, Skeeter flattens him reaches
          down and pulls the covers up over his entire body.SKEETER (CONT'D)Don't move a muscle!
          Skeeter props up on her side and faces the door making sure
          the covers hide that she's clothed.

          so hard she has to lower herself to the floor.MISSUS WALTERSWell, Hilly, that's what you get, I
           guess. And you didn't just eat
           one. You ate two slices!

           add something personal to it.
          Skeeter nods with frustration.INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - BALLROOM - LATER THAT NIGHTThe African Children's Benefit Ball is well underway.
          The energy and look of the two hundred attendees feel like a
          throwback to the women's suffrage movement. Many older women
          wear heavy long black skirts and jackets.
          Hilly wears swathes of maroon-colored taffeta. Ruffles
          clutch her throat. She stands next to Jolene French and aWLBT CAMERAMAN.Dressed to the nines, Jolene raises a microphone and looks
          into the camera.JOLENEThis is Jolene French reporting
           from the African Children's Benefit

          Three dozen servers stand in a line. Minny and Aibileen are
          among them.
          Tables are covered with items donated for the auction.
          On the baked goods table, Minny's famed chocolate pie
          promises to again be a big money maker.
          Celia and Johnny enter the ballroom. Celia wears a hideous,
          pink and silver sequined gown. As usual, Celia's breasts
          command attention.
          The room locks on Celia as specks of light bounce off her
          dress and jiggle across the ceiling.
          A TITILLATED OLD HUSBAND tips his martini onto his wife's
          shoe.OLD HUSBAND(a little too loudly)

          wife responds louder.OLD WIFEBosoms are for bedrooms and breast-
           feeding. Not occasions of dignity.
          Celia downs a glass of champagne and leans into Johnny.CELIADo you think I might have
           overdressed a little? It's
           supposed to be formal, but this
           looks like a funeral.JOHNNYYou look gorgeous.
          Minny pulls Aibileen aside and points to Celia.MINNYLook what she got on.
          Celia grabs more champagne from a passing server.AIBILEENLord have mercy. Ladies better
           hold onto they husbands tonight.
          Celia catches eyes with Minny. She smiles and nods quickly
          and then looks away, careful not to tip off Johnny of their
          relationship.MINNY(REGARDING JOHNNY)And that's the man that don't even
           know he's paying me.
          Skeeter enters with Stuart. She wears a long-sleeved black
          velvet dress and her hair is being somewhat cooperative.AIBILEENThere's Skeeter and that must be
           Stuart. He's handsome... Missus
           Walters?!
          Missus Walters enters wearing a floor-length blue beaded
          gown, circa 1943. A white orchid wilts at her clavicle.MINNYHilly can throw her in a home, but
           she can't keep the taxis away.INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - BALLROOM - LATER THAT NIGHTCelia approaches Elizabeth and Jolene who talk next to a

          with an umbrella sticking out of it.CELIAWell, hello, Elizabeth.103.ELIZABETHHi.
          Elizabeth's homemade maternity ball gown resembles a velvet
          potato sack cinched with red ribbon.CELIAThose are lovely dresses.JOLENEYours too.CELIAReally?! I was worried I was a tad
           overdressed.

          Elizabeth pulls Jolene away. Celia downs her drink.INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - BALLROOM - LATER THAT EVENINGThe guests are now seated at twenty-eight round tables.
          Scores of black servers dressed in tuxedos ferry plates.
          Hilly makes her way to the podium.HILLYEverybody enjoying their dinner?
          The room claps enthusiastically.HILLY (CONT'D)(FLATLY)Let's give a nice round of applause
           for all the men and women that have
           helped make tonight possible.
          Hilly mechanically gestures toward the servers in the room.HILLY (CONT'D)A cause I'm sure is dear to their
           hearts as well.
          Skeeter shakes her head as the less inspired applause dies
          down. Celia waves to Minny and jumps out of her chair.CELIAWoo-hoo!
          Johnny grabs Celia by the arm and pulls her back down. Celia
          reaches for Johnny's glass of wine.JOHNNYHoney, maybe you've had enough to
           drink. Try to eat your dinner.104.CELIAAnd have my stomach poke out?!INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - LATER THAT EVENINGAs Celia looks at the prize table's bids, Johnny and Stuart
          lean against a bar chatting with a few other bored men.
          Hilly suddenly slides next to Johnny completely ignoring
          Stuart.HILLYWhy, Johnny Foote. I'm surprised
           to see you here. Everybody knows
           you can't stand parties like this.
          Hilly squeezes the crook of his arm.JOHNNYCelia wouldn't have missed this for
           anything.HILLYWhere is that wife of yours? Out
           selling hotdogs?
          Johnny looks away.HILLY (CONT'D)Oh, you know I'm teasing you. We
           dated long enough where I can do
           that, can't I?
          Johnny walks away leaving Hilly no choice but to acknowledge
          Stuart. She and Stuart never look each other's way.HILLY (CONT'D)(FLATLY)Stuart.STUART(FLATTER)Hilly.

           baked goods goes to Minny Jackson's
           chocolate pie. Congratulations,
           Hilly Holbrook!
          The room erupts in applause. Hilly now sits at a table with
          her family, Missus Walters, and the Leefolts.
          Skeeter and Stuart sit at a table full of elderly people they
          don't know.
          Minny clears dishes nearby. Hearing her name, she becomes
          very alert.HILLYWhat? I didn't bid on anything.
          Minny turns to find Hilly smiling at her tightly.HILLY (CONT'D)Well, wasn't that sweet. Someone
           signed me up for that pie.SKEETER(TO STUART)Oh, no.
          Celia rushes up behind Hilly, her voice slurred.CELIACongratulations, Hilly! I didn't
           know you're a fan of Minny's pies.
          Hilly remains calm. Celia grabs Hilly's long sleeve.CELIA (CONT'D)I've wanted to talk to you all
           night. Minny told me why you won't
           be my friend. You think me and
           Johnny went behind your back.HILLYLet me go!
          Hilly stands up and pulls away. A ripping sound cuts through
          the air.
          Celia stares at Hilly's torn cuff in her hands.STUARTOh, God.CELIAI'm so sorry.HILLY(GRITTED TEETH)What are you trying to do to me?
           What are you and that nigra up to?106.Jolene announces another round of winners loudly over the
          microphone, forcing Celia to raise her voice.CELIAI don't know what you-HILLY-You liar! Who did you tell?!
          Jolene loses her place on the list. The room grows quiet but
          Celia is still yelling.CELIAHilly, I got pregnant after you and
           Johnny broke up!
          The room echoes with Celia's words. Across the room, women's
          noses wrinkle.MISSUS WALTERSOh, shit.HILLYShut up, Mother.
          Stuart belts out with a laugh. Skeeter pinches his arm.
          Celia is mortified. Sweat beads on her forehead.CELIAJohnny never cheated on you...At
           least, not with me.
          Celia starts to breathe heavily. Her eyes start to water.HILLYJohnny would never-CELIAAnd I'm sorry I thought you'd be
           tickled to win that pie.HILLYYou tell that nigra if she tells
           anybody, I will make her suffer.
          Horrified, Skeeter catches eyes with Minny and Aibileen.
          They all immediately look away.
          Johnny makes his way over. Celia holds her breath, shaking
          her head back and forth.JOHNNYCelia, what's wrong, Honey?CELIAUh-oh.
          Celia leans over and vomits on the fleur-de-lis print carpet.
          The entire room gasps in horror.107.JOHNNYOh, shit!
          Johnny tries to pull Celia back. She pushes Johnny away and
          runs for the bathroom. He follows.
          Hilly marches over to Aibileen who is standing nearby.HILLYGet that cleaned up before it
           starts to smell.AIBILEENYes, ma'am.INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHTMinny's daughter, Sugar, stands over a large commercial sink
          filled with sudsy water, washing dishes.

          other young girls.SUGARThat big-boobed lady Momma works
           for was drunker than an Injun on
           payday. Upchucked in front a

          As the girls all laugh, Minny pops Sugar hard on the back of
          her head.MINNYDon't you never let me hear you
           talking bad about the lady who puts
           food in your mouth. Clothes on

          Hilly spins around and sees the pie.108.HILLYYou throw that pie away right now!MISSUS WALTERSI spent good money on this. Won it
           just for you...HILLYYou?! You signed me up?
          Missus Walters steps up to Hilly.MISSUS WALTERSI may have trouble remembering my
           own name and what country I live
           in. But there's two things I can't

           dinner got on the table if you laid
           up in bed?
          Celia pulls the covers off her head and sits up a little.CELIAThe way Hilly looked at me. Like I
           was trash on the road.
          Celia pulls a letter out from under the covers.CELIA (CONT'D)She billed me for her dress. In
           lieu of payment, she's asked that I
           send two-hundred dollars to the
           African Children's Fund and then
           she banned me from all future

           yourself by the way she see you.CELIAI'm not right for this kind of

           table for twelve people.109.CELIA (CONT'D)I couldn't get two people over here
           if I begged. She called me a liar
           and accused me of getting her that
           pie. I wouldn't have thrown up if
           it wasn't for that! I can't do
           this anymore to Johnny. I'm going
           back to Sugar Ditch.MINNYYou gone leave your husband cause

          Celia sobs.MINNY (CONT'D)Lord, I reckon it's time you knew.INT. FOOTE ESTATE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATERCelia stares at Minny, wide-eyed and disgusted.MINNYMiss Hilly thought you knew `bout
           "The Terrible Awful," that you were

           she pounced on you. But if you
           leave Mister Johnny, then Miss
           Hilly done won the whole ball game.
           Then she done beat me, and she done
           beat you.

          the bedside table with a wet rag draped over the side.
          Charlotte is wig free and terribly thin. Her collarbone
          protrudes long and narrow, but her eyes are as sharp as ever.CHARLOTTEHave you been crying? You know
           that ages your skin, Dear.SKEETERMother, I need to talk to you about
           Constantine.CHARLOTTEOh, Eugenia. That was so long ago.SKEETERWell, I have to speak to her.CHARLOTTENow, you look. I was good to

           that morning so they'd be dry in

          Charlotte finds Constantine mopping the foyer very slowly.
          The effects of arthritis are apparent.CHARLOTTE (V.O.) (CONT'D)Well, the floors were soaking wet
           when the first guest arrived.
          A guest unnecessarily grabs a table for balance, making a

          Constantine pushes the casserole cart around and begins
          serving lunch.
          As the guests sip coffee, each woman grimaces and turns to
          Charlotte.CHARLOTTE (V.O.)Then, she burned the coffee. She
           had gotten so old, Skeeter.
          Charlotte shoots Constantine a look. Constantine nods
          sorrowfully. She picks up a woman's plate and begins filling
          it with food from the cart very slowly.
          Constantine strains to lower the plate in front of the woman.
          Her hands tremble.CHARLOTTE (V.O.) (CONT'D)Her mishaps were becoming a daily
           occurrence, and I had had it.
          The plate tilts causing peas to pour into the woman's lap.WOMANWatch out!
          With that, Charlotte stands up and slaps the table with her
          hand.CHARLOTTEGet a hold of yourself,
           Constantine!
          Constantine slowly looks to Charlotte. Totally exhausted,
          she grips the casserole cart with both hands to steady
          herself.113.CHARLOTTE (V.O.) (CONT'D)And that's when it happened.
          Constantine wets herself.
          Slowly the women begin realizing what's happening. The two
          women closest to Constantine gasp and quickly move away from
          her.
          Another woman rises from the table covering her mouth with a
          napkin and leaves the room.
          Just now realizing what has happened, Constantine looks down
          at her soiled dress. No one says a word. No one comes to
          Constantine's aid.

           else to do.SKEETERSo you just threw her away? That

           and self respect and you just threw
           her away like a broken appliance.
          Charlotte starts to cry. Skeeter isn't affected.114.CHARLOTTEI didn't throw her away, Skeeter.
           Your daddy went to her house the

          Skeeter nods.AIBILEENGo find your life, Miss Skeeter.EXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - NIGHTSkeeter stands next to the barn smoking a cigarette reading
          the Harper and Row offer for the hundredth time.
          Tires crunch gravel down the drive. Skeeter sees a car
          moving toward her with the headlights off.
          Worried, Skeeter looks toward her home. Charlotte can be
          seen in an upstairs window.
          Skeeter soon recognizes the car as Hilly's.
          Hilly parks, lights a cigarette and gets out of her car.
          Skeeter charges toward her.SKEETERWhat are you doing here?
          Hilly screams and throws her lit cigarette at Skeeter.HILLYDon't you get an inch closer!
          Hilly's a mess. Her shirt is half tucked. Her shorts strain
          to contain a newly developed layer of fat.
          A horrible fever blister burns hot on Hilly's upper lip.HILLY (CONT'D)I've contacted my lawyer, Hibbie
           Goodman. He's the best libel
           attorney in Mississippi. You're in

           going to jail.SKEETERYou can't prove anything, Hilly.HILLYI one-hundred-percent know you
           wrote it `cause nobody else in town

           You don't know anything.131.HILLYI don't, do I? You tell Aibileen,
           the next time she wants to write
           about my dear friend Elizabeth...uh-
           huh. Remember her? Had you in her
           wedding? Let's just say, Aibileen
           ought to've been a little bit
           smarter before putting in the L-
           shaped crack in poor Elizabeth's
           dining table. And that nigra,
           Minny? Do I have plans for her.SKEETERCareful, Hilly. Don't give
           yourself away now.HILLYThat was not me WHO ATE THAT PIE!
          Hilly storms up the porch steps. Skeeter follows.SKEETERI did not invite you here!
          Skeeter yanks Hilly's arm hard.HILLYI've come to tell your mother what
           a hippie you've become. She's
           gonna be disgusted by you.
          Skeeter can't help but laugh.SKEETERYou're telling my mother on me?
          Hilly opens the door. Skeeter grabs her. They struggle.SKEETER (CONT'D)You get out of here!
          Charlotte suddenly appears. Skeeter lets go of Hilly.CHARLOTTEWhy, Hilly...It's been such a long
           time, Dear. Everything okay, you
           two?
          Hilly is shocked by Charlotte's frail appearance.HILLYMissus Phelan, I'm...I'm here to-CHARLOTTEHilly, you're a mess. Are you ill?
          Hilly self-consciously licks her fever blister.HILLYWell, I...I didn't have time to get
           fixed up before-132.CHARLOTTEDarling, no husband wants to come
           home and see this.
          Charlotte peers closely at Hilly's cold sore.CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)And that...that is horrendous.HILLYMissus Phelan, I'm here-CHARLOTTEYou know, Hilly. If I didn't know
           any better, I'd say you've been
           eating too many...SWEETS?
          Hilly's face turns purple with embarrassment. Charlotte
          moves in for the kill.CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)In fact. I'm sure of it. Now GET
           OUT OF MY HOUSE...before we all get
           one of those on our lip.
          Hilly looks back and forth between Skeeter and her mother,
          not knowing what to say.
          Hilly runs out of the house as Charlotte sashays quietly into
          the living room.
          Shocked, Skeeter stands alone in the foyer. Hilly sprays
          gravel across the Phelan yard as she speeds away.CHARLOTTE (O.C.) (CONT'D)Eugenia?SKEETERYes, Ma'am.CHARLOTTE (O.C.)Come in here, please.

          Skeeter lets out a big sigh of relief.CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)`Cause no single daughter of mine

          Charlotte reaches down and pulls up her copy of "The Help".CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)Would you do me the honor of
           signing my copy?
          Skeeter nods. Charlotte hands Skeeter a pen. Her hand
          trembles as she signs the book, never having guessed how good
          it would feel.INT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - MORNINGAibileen washes dishes as the phone begins to ring. She

          Elizabeth is two weeks WAY PAST DUE.AIBILEENGood morning.
          Hilly licks her cold sore as she steps forward. She glides
          her hand across the L-shaped crack in the Elizabeth's table,
          drawing Aibileen's attention to it.HILLYAibileen, the silver I lent
           Elizabeth last week.AIBILEENIt not polished good? Humidity

           trying to blame it on a toddler.

          Elizabeth whispers to Hilly.ELIZABETHShe says she doesn't have them.HILLYThen it behooves me to inform you
           that you are fired, Aibileen. And
           I'll be calling the police. They

          Aibileen rises up from Mae Mobley and turns to Elizabeth.AIBILEENGive my sweet girl a chance.

          She comes across a piece from Celia Foote addressed to The
          Starving Children of Africa Fund. A smug smile forms.
          She opens the envelope to find a check for $200.00 made out

          Aibileen takes this last page out of the typewriter and

          glasses hang on a chain from around her neck.
          As she begins a slow walk down the hall, we see the
          surroundings of her new home for the first time. It's much
          bigger, well furnished and beautiful.
          She passes a study lined with shelves of books. A copy of
          "The Help" and "All My Babies" are placed side by side.
          At the end of the hall, Aibileen approaches the opened door
          of a brightly lit, sparkling white, bathroom.
