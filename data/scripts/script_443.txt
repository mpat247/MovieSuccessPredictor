          on a stool in complete silhouette. This is RICK COOGAN.RICKCan you imagine it, Regis, Kathie
           Lee? One day I'm a hot young
           movie star, and the next day I'm a
           hideous mutant freak, covered with
           festering lesions.
                         
          Oddly, REGIS and KATHIE LEE are also in complete silhouette.REGISSounds like my wife when she misses

           (to Rick, she turnsEARNEST)Ricky, once you were the all-
           American boy next door, star of the
           beloved Hey Dude films. Now the
           very mention of your name makes
           children scream in terror. We've
           all read about your disturbing
           story. But the people want to hear
           it from you, Ricky Coogan.
           (SFX: children scream)
           Won't you tell us your story?RICKWell, it's kinda long, but okay.
           It all started when I signed a deal
           to be spokesman for the E.E.S.
           conglomerate...DISSOLVE TO:INT. E.E.S. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAYThe E.E.S. logo--a large metal shoe with a bar across it,
          with the words "Everything Except Shoes" beneath. Widen to
          reveal RICHARD HERTZ, president of E.E.S., smiling rigidly to
          camera. RICK COOGAN is next to him, also holding a stiff
          movie-star smile. FLASH! They shake hands as the EES
          photographer takes publicity shots. Off to one side, behind
          Hertz, are several EES EXECUTIVES. Behind Rick is his
          entourage: LAWYER, BODYGUARD, TRAINER, STYLIST, and SPIRITGUIDE.2.Further off, at the boardroom table, four DODDERING OLD
          CORPORATE FARTS on the brink of death look on with glazed
          expressions.RICK(through a clenched smile)
           So, what kind of crap do you
           scumbags want me to peddle?HERTZEverything. Everything except
           shoes, of course. Hah hah...
                         
          He laughs pathetically. Rick doesn't respond. Hertz nods to
          a nearby EXECUTIVE who hands him some BEEF STICKS.HERTZMeaty Twig Beef Sticks.
                         
          Rick takes them and holds them up to the camera. Smiles.

          He takes the hair spray and holds it up. Smile. Flash.
                         
          The assistant carefully hands Hertz a pulsating metal
          container with lots of warnings and danger symbols on it.
          Hertz gives it to Rick.HERTZNoxon 24 biogenetic neuro-
           fertilizer.
                         
          Rick holds it up, then pushes it away in disgust.RICKFertilizer? Ricky Coogan does not
           do ads for hi-tech cow shit. I'm a
           star, got it, Hertz?
           (to his aide)
           Rico, give these misguided clowns
           Tony Danza's phone number, and
           let's get the hell out of here.
                         
          He gives the finger to the EES photographer, who obligingly
          takes a picture. Hertz waves at him to get lost, and calls
          after Rick who's headed to the door with his entourage.HERTZRick. Wait! Only you can stand up
           to the radicals trying to keep
           Noxon from the struggling farmers
           whose very future depends on it.3.RICK(HESITATES)Noxon? Wasn't that just banned?HERTZOnly in the U.S....and Europe.RICKBut I heard that shit's lethal.
                         
          Hertz lets out a big laugh. He shakes his head at Rick.HERTZRick, Rick, Rick... You want
           proof? Fine. Just take a seat.
           Please.
                         
          Rick nods to his entourage. They sit at the boardroom table,
          across from the EES execs. An easel behind Hertz shows a
          placard with a bar graph. Hertz whispers something to an
          aide, who scurries off.HERTZ(TO RICK)Meet the head of our South American
           research facility, Juan Valdez.
                         
          The aide ushers in a handsome LATIN AMERICAN EXECUTIVE in a
          natty three-piece suit and a sombrero.GEORGEMy name is George Ramirez.HERTZWhatever. He's worked with Noxon
           24 every day for five years, and
           he's in fine shape. Aren't you,
           Juan?
                         
          George glares at Hertz bitterly. Hertz stares him down.GEORGEYes. I am fine. Me and my team in
           Santa Flan have--RICKSanta "Flan?" What kind of shitty
           name for a country is that?GEORGEIt is named for the patron saint of
           creamy desserts... As I was
           saying, we've worked very closely
           with Noxon...4.Rick nods. We cut back to George, but he isn't George
          anymore. He has mutated into a similar looking actor, in the
          same suit, the same sombrero, but shorter and swarthier.GEORGE (CONT'D)I personally supervised its
           development...
                         
          Rick furrows his brow. He's a little suspicious of George's
          transformation, but just a little.
                         
          Now George is even shorter, even swarthier. Yet another
          actor.GEORGE (CONT'D)I performed rigorous scientific
           tests. No potential danger was
           left uninvestigated...
                         
          Rick's suspicion is increasing. He looks over to Hertz, who
          feigns total innocence.
                         
          George is now even shorter. Still another actor. His
          clothes are baggy, and the sombrero is starting to slide down
          over his face.GEORGE (CONT'D)The environmentalists are
           crackpots, all of them.
                         
          Rick looks at his entourage. Their mouths hang open in
          astonishment.
                         
          George has now shrunk to near-midget proportions. The
          sombrero completely covers his head. When he takes it off,
          we see he's now played by LINDA HUNT!GEORGEIt's ridiculous, I tell you.
           Totally ridiculous!
                         
          Rick is ready to ask questions, but Hertz cuts him off.HERTZThank you, Valdez. That will be
           all.
                         
          George nods and heads back to his seat. As he passes behind
          Hertz, he can't resist sticking his thumbs in his ears and
          making a face.RICKWait a second--5.HERTZRicky, this is important. We're
           talking about a major threat to the
           EES image. How does 2 million
           dollars plus expenses sound?
                         
          The aide reveals a new placard on the easel. It reads "$2MILLION."RICKLook, it sounds great, but--HERTZI hear you. Make it five million--
           (a new placard: 5 MILLION)
           that is, if the board agrees ...
                         
          Hertz reaches beside his chair and pulls a lever. The old
          geezers beside him raise their arms stiffly, as if they were
          being pulled by strands of fishing line, which they are.HERTZGood, it's unanimous. Well, what
           do you say, Ricky? Are you EES's
           "Man in Santa Flan?"
                         
          Rick looks at his advisors--they look over at Linda Hunt,
          then emphatically shake their heads "NO." Rick looks at
          Hertz, who shows him five big fingers and grins. Rick breaks
          into a big smile and gives Hertz his trademark thumbs up
          sign.CUT TO:INT. L.A. AIRPORT SECURITY CHECKRick stands in line at the luggage X-ray machine. He
          impatiently checks his watch as the X-RAY CHECKER chats him
          up. A CRAZED ANARCHIST holding a large bomb passes through
          the security check unquestioned.X-RAY CHECKERMy kids just loved you in "Hey Dude
           Three: The Final Countdown." We

          a bunch of STEWARDESSES scattering from a trendy young cad
          with a fake hand sticking out of his fly. This is ERNIE,
          Rick's buddy and resident court jester.ERNIELadies! All I wanted was a

          points to Rick's large carry-on bag as it emerges from the X-
          ray machine.X-RAY CHECKER(TO RICK)Mister Coogan, is this your bag?RICKYeah, why?X-RAY CHECKERIs this your kid?
                         
          He indicates the X-ray monitor, where we see the skeleton
          outline of a BUCKTOOTHED, BESPECTACLED 10 YEAR OLD KID curled
          up in Rick's bag. The kid waves. Rick and Ernie look at
          each other in horror.RICK/ERNIEStuey Gluck!
                         
          The bag bursts open, and out pops STUEY GLUCK, an obsessive
          young autograph hound toting a stack of scrapbooks and
          memorabilia.STUEYRick! Rick! Look! I got a rare
           still from your high school

           Could you sign it for me?
           Please?!RICKNO!(TO ERNIE)Let's get the hell out of here!7.Ernie nods and yanks the bag away from under Stuey. They run
          away down the corridor. Stuey chases them, holding up an 8
          by 10 photo.STUEYRick! Wait up!FURTHER DOWN THE CORRIDORRick and Ernie run around a corner with Stuey in pursuit.STUEYRick! Remember the speech you gave
           at the Actors Forum for Social

          He holds up a cassette player and hits play. It's Rick's old
          speech.RICK'S VOICE (FROM TAPE)If all the world is a stage, then

          Ernie leads Rick down an adjacent hallway.IN THE HALLWAYIt's a dead end. Rick and Ernie are trapped. Ernie gives
          Rick a sheepish look. Stuey stands at the entrance of the
          hallway. He holds up a Time magazine.STUEYRick! Rick! It says here Noxon's
           dangerous. Why are you lending

          Stuey starts to cry. Rick looks guilty.RICKDon't cry, Stuey, I'm still good.8.BAM! A passing electric baggage cart nails Stuey at full
          speed and carries him off down the corridor, screaming bloody
          murder.RICKALRIGHT!Rick and Ernie high five.CUT TO:INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN - DAYA SEXY STEWARDESS pours champagne for Rick and Ernie. The
          anarchist sits nearby with the bomb on his lap. Rick winks
          suggestively at the stewardess. She walks off, obviously not
          interested. Rick raises his glass to Ernie, oozing sleazy
          confidence.RICKIn the bag.
                         
          The plane hits turbulence, and Rick's drink flies up out of
          his glass--he catches it as it comes down. Another
          STEWARDESS helps the Anarchist put his bomb in the overhead
          compartment. Ernie ogles her. She sneers at him. We hear
          the CAPTAIN'S voice on the loudspeaker.CAPTAIN (V.0.)Ladies and gentlemen, this is your
           captain speaking. To the right of
           the aircraft, you can see a great

          They squint into the distance, where they see a group of

          Ernie tries to get in on the conversation.ERNIEHey Julie. You know I'm kind of an
           idea man myself. Like, let's say
           there's a nuclear war, and the only
           two people left are you and the
           Pope... Would you pork him?
                         
          Disgusted, Julie smacks Ernie sharply and continues massaging
          Rick. Scowling with jealousy, Ernie tries a new approach.ERNIEBut one thing's for sure. That
           Coogan guy sure is an asshole, huh?JULIEI'll say! What a total piece of
           shit. Don't you think so, Josh?

          reads "See the Incredabel Humin Werm! Only at Elijah C.

          past a sizzling electric fence. Rick, Julie, and Ernie get
          out and look around. It's eerily quiet.
                         
          There is a large dilapidated mining shed complete with rusted
          ducts and a tall smoke stack, a tattered carnival tent with
          an ornate stage flat facade, a lopsided outhouse, a creepy
          broken-down farm house, and in the center of it all, a giant
          molded carnival head with big staring eyes, which slowly
          rotates on a creaky base.
                         
          Ernie looks hard at the big eyes. He turns away for a
          second, then spins around again. The EYES are looking in a
          different direction. Ernie shakes his head and unwraps a
          chocolate bar.JULIEIsn't it great? It's so "real"...RICKReal stupid.(TO ERNIE)Let's go. This place is dead.ERNIEYeah. Where are all the weirdos?VOICE (O.S.)There are no weirdos here.
                         
          Startled, they turn to see ELIJAH C. SKUGGS, a twisted,
          haggard old man. He takes a bite out of an ice cream cone
          which contains the rear half of a chipmunk with a maraschino
          cherry on top. Elijah has bad teeth, a bad shave, and scary
          eyes. We now realize the giant head is molded in his image.17.ELIJAHMutants, yes. Genetic nightmares,
           definitely. Children of Hell and

          Elijah smiles, unfazed. Julie glares at Rick. She smiles
          apologetically at Elijah.JULIEWe'd like to see your freak show.
           You see, only by appreciating the
           variety and innovation of nature
           can we come to respect the fragile

          bar and finds only the empty wrapper left in his hand.ERNIEHey! What the--

          Rick and Ernie pretend to be disappointed. They turn to
          leave. Julie's sincerely upset.JULIEOh, just our luck...
                         
          Elijah grabs Rick's shoulder and turns him around.ELIJAHHowever! I do have a private

          He raises his cigarette to his lips, but it's gone! He turns
          to see Toad, ten feet behind him, puffing away happily.
          Hmmm. Elijah is already leading Julie towards the shed.JULIEThe sideshow tradition has been
           misrepresented by the media. You
           don't traffic in human misery. You

          "Where'd you find this nutty chick?"
                         
          Rick shrugs and follows, taking Ernie with him.ERNIEWhat the heck. We'll see some
           pickled dog brains, maybe some
           pictures of women with, you know,
           added equipment.RICKAnd to think we could be in the
           limo with those stewardesses.
                         
          Elijah holds the shed door open for them. It's pitch black
          inside. Julie enters. Rick and Ernie follow.ERNIEWhat the hell, Coog, these people
           are weird, but they seem nice
           enough.A CUTE BUNNYsits outside the shed. THWAP! Toad lashes out with his ten
          foot tongue, and sucks the bunny into his mouth. He shuffles
          into the shed, crunching contentedly.
                         
          Elijah closes the shed doors in our face, grinning. we hear
          a lonq peal of EVIL LAUGHTER from inside.ELIJAHAH-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA! HE-HE-HE! HA-HAHA! HE-HO-HE-HE-HA-HA! AH-HA-HA-HEHA! YAH-HA-HA-HA-HEE-HEE-HO-HA-HE-HE!INT. SHEDIt's dark and spooky. Elijah stands in a pool of light,

           (he tosses the funniesASIDE)But perhaps I should tell you a
           little more about what I do. You
           see, I not only exhibit freaks, I
           make them. Just like Michelangelo
           saw the angel in the stone, I look

          answers his question. Elijah shrugs and goes back to his
          spiel.ELIJAHBehold! The Tasty Freekz machine!
                         
          He pulls a tarp off a huge complicated machine. Several
          drums and vats of various chemicals feed through a crude
          network of pipes, gadgets and computers into an old Tasty
          Freeze soft serve ice cream machine (The logo has been
          changed to "Tasty Freekz"). The biggest vat reads "NOXON24."JULIEMy God! He's using Noxon Twenty-
           Four!RICKHey! You're not supposed to have
           that stuff!ELIJAHOh? Well, I guess I'm not supposed
           to have these either!21.He holds up a matching towel and washcloth embroidered with
          the "Ramada Inn" logo. Rick, Julie, and Ernie gasp. He
          tosses the towels.
                         
          As Elijah gets worked up into a frenzy, the ambience in the
          room becomes more and more horrific: the sunlight is replaced
          by an eerie green glow, a thunderstorm rumbles to life, a
          raven perches on the windowsill, a rat scurries across the
          floor, one of those plastic "Bony Banks" reaches out and
          grabs a quarter...ELIJAHI need only punch a few buttons on
           this magnificent device, and it
           gives me an easy-to-apply ointment
           that will mutate a perfect young
           body, bubble its skin, warp its
           bones and twist its guts into ANUNSPEAKABLY REPULSIVE, STOMACH-TURNING FREAK OF MY OWN DESIGN!Elijah's hair is now standing on end. He's foaming at the
          mouth. A bolt of lightning and THUNDERCLAP cap the
          monologue.JULIEWait a minute. Does this mean
           we're not going to see a show?ELIJAH(IGNORES HER)Toad, fire up that machine, and

          past him to a jerry-rigged computer console. He punches some
          keys and some rotating DNA models appear on the monitor.ELIJAH(mumbling to himself)
           It's like Yin and Yang... AC/DC...

          He presses "enter" and the computer beeps. He smiles.ELIJAHLet 'er rip, Toad!
                         
          Toad yanks a pull-start cord and the machine rumbles to life.
          Elijah pulls the Tasty Freekz lever and fills a small dish
          with phosphorescent ointment. Toad cuts open their clothes,
          exposing their sides, and pushes them close together.ERNIEWait a second. You're really gonna
           smear that stuff on us and mutate
           our body parts!?ELIJAHCorrect.ERNIEWell... then could you give me a
           really big rodney?ELIJAHI'm a mad scientist pal, not a
           miracle worker.
                         
          Elijah smears the ointment on their exposed sides. Their
          skin begins to bubble and undulate.JULIE/ERNIEOh God!... No!... Holy shit!(ETC)A grapefruit-sized lump pops up on Ernie's side, then another
          on Julie's side, and then the lumps do a little synchronized
          dance together. Suddenly Ernie's flesh balloons out and
          melds into Julie's side. The mass of connected skin
          continues to bubble and mutate. Odd shapes press up underTHE SKIN:Four humans faces that quickly become Mount Rushmore...

          Gumby and Pokey mutate back into a blob and then into...JULIE/ERNIEjoined side to side, their two heads on a single body which
          is split down the middle--half Julie, half Ernie. Elijah
          wheels a large mirror in front of them.ELIJAHFeast your eyes!JULIENOOOOO!ERNIEWell, at least I'll never have to

          of "Freak Out," by Chic. A man's laughing voice comes on the
          other end of the line. It laughs throughout the
          "conversation".ELIJAHLaughing Man? Red Swan. I've done
           it! I found the perfect subject--
           huge ego, shallow personality,

          Elijah hangs up the phone, and strides over towards Rick.ELIJAHWakey, wakey. Time to meet and
           greet the new you.RICKHuh?
                         
          He flips the slab right-side up, and holds up a mirror.
          Rick's eyes widen in terror as he beholds his hideous new
          form. Rick's left half has been transformed into a hideous,
          bug-eyed monster!RICKAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!CUT TO:EXT. LAB - MORNINGBANG! The doors fly open. Elijah drags Rick out.

          from his tool belt.INT. FREAK HOUSEIt takes a few moments for Rick's eyes to adjust to the dim
          light. There's nobody in sight. The walls are lined with
          dark cubicles, stacked atop each other with walkways like
          prison cells. Rick staggers to his feet, and makes his way
          forward.RICKErnie? Julie?ERNIEOver here, Coog.JULIEAre you alright?

          Rick wheels around to see JUAN THE DOG BOY, snickering behind
          him. Juan is a hairy young Mexican with a snout, dog ears,
          and canine teeth--Scrappy Doo with an attitude.

          He extends a hand to Rick. Rick doesn't take it. He hears a
          slight RUSTLING noise from the direction of the cubicles, and
          turns to look around the apparently empty Freak House.30.RICKNo thanks. I don't plan on staying

           Worm!
                         
          The top right cubicle lights up, revealing the WORM. He is a
          man with no arms and legs, and the wrinkly, slimy body of a
          worm. His face is learned-looking, with spectacles, a small
          goatee, and a pipe which he puffs on pompously.JUANTell us, Worm, who starred in

           it going to be?
                         
          As Juan names the freaks one by one, their square is
          highlighted, and they wave at Rick cheerily.JUAN (CONT'D)Nosey the Nose Man!
                         
          NOSEY is a man whose massive nose dominates his head. He
          blows into a huge hanky, and waves it wearily at Rick.JUAN (CONTD)Cowboy!

          apathetically.JUANRosie the Pinhead!
                         
          ROSIE is a pinhead in dark sunglasses. She has a great bod
          jammed into a sexy dress. She smokes a cigarette demurely,
          and waves a small, arrogant big-star wave.JUANThe hideous Frog Man!
                         
          Frogman is just a guy in a scuba outfit. He strikes a
          threatening "monster" pose, then gives a friendly wave.JUANAnd of course, in the center
           square, Mr. Paul Lynde!
                         
          Suddenly the lighting changes to flashing red horror lights
          with plenty of dark shadows. There's a horrific MUSIC STING
          and we ZOOM IN to a DECOMPOSING SKELETON in the center
          cubicle. Its eyeball drips out of the socket.JUANWell JulieErnie, who will it be?ERNIECall me old-fashioned, but I'll go
           with Paul Lynde.JULIEDon't be an idiot.
                         
          They argue back and forth, hitting and poking each other 3
          Stooges style. Juan turns to Rick.JUANYou see, Rick? Just because we're
           freaks doesn't mean we can't have
           some fun, huh?
                         
          Rick is overwhelmed by it all. He backs away.RICKGet away from me. Get away! I'm

          Rick shoots him a look.JULIEAll the freaks have gone through
           this anguish, Rick. At first, I
           was blinded by my anger. I admit
           it. I wanted to break your neck
           for getting me into this. But I
           got over it. Juan taught me to

          Julie regains her cool. She takes out a pamphlet, scribbles
          something on it, and hands it to Rick.JULIEHere. Take it.
                         
          Rick examines the cover. He reads it aloud.34.RICK"So You're a Hideous Mutant Freak--

          He throws the-pamphlet to the ground, just as the Worm,
          Bearded Lady, and Sockhead approach. They sit down in a
          circle around him. The Worm looks down at the pamphlet and
          puffs thoughtfully on his pipe.WORMYou're mistaken, Rick. You are
           exactly like us. We were all

           I came in search of the
           Epsosophecci dilepsidae--in layman
           terms, the fat pudgy worm. Mr.
           Skuggs said he had just such a worm
           in his shed. How could I have
           surmised that the specimen and I

          We see professor Worm meet Elijah, and follow him into the

           are over. Now, in retrospect, I

          Rick closes the pamphlet, looks at the number "8" Julie

          throws the hammer carelessly aside into the muck, and walks
          towards the cubicles.CUT TO:INT. FREAK HOUSE - DAYRick walks past the cubicles. In one, the Bearded Lady knits

          large blank blocks, like the "letters" on the game show. So
          far, there's a "D", two "S"s, and a "K" revealed. Rosie the
          Pinhead plays Vanna White's role.NOSEYI'd like to buy a vowel.
                         
          The Bearded lady yawns. Rick edges towards them.RICKHey. The Wheel. Mind if I sit in?
                         
          Juan advances towards Rick, sneering.JUANSo. Now you don't mind mixing with
           us--how did you say it--sorry
           mutants?RICKLook! I'm sorry for what happened
           at the show. Can't you just forget
           it?
                         
          He shakes his finger at Juan, and notices there's still a
          human nose stuck on his monster claw. He wipes it off,
          embarrassed. There's an awkward pause. Ernie breaks the
          silence.ERNIEHey, shouldn't you tell Rick about
           your big escape plan?
                         
          Juan gives Ernie a nasty "shut up" look. He growls at him.ERNIEWell, excuse me for living.RICKYou have an escape plan?JUANListen, Beast Boy, the games are a
           simple diversion.(MORE)51.JUAN(CONT'D)Beneath our twisted flesh we freaks
           cry out for freedom!
           Aooooooorrraaaagh!
                         
          Juan howls lustily. He looks to rest of the freaks. They're
          a pathetic lot, and their half-hearted howl proves it.FREAKSAoo...
                         
          Beat.JULIEJuan's plan is really ingenious
           Rick. See, he figured out that--JUANI figured out that our escape does
           not include the Beast Boy. No one
           may discuss the plan with him,
           understand?
                         
          Juan gives the others a threatening look. They mumble
          agreement.RICKWhat's the matter with all of you?
           You trust your lives to a guy just
           'cause he can lick his own
           privates?
                         
          The freaks ponder this a second, then nod "yes".ERNIEYou gotta admit, Coog, it's a
           helluva trick.RICK(RESENTFUL)Fine! I'll just come up with an
           escape plan of my own then.JUANHaha! I have spent a year studying
           this hellhole, devising the perfect
           escape. You think you'll just
           tango right out the door!? Ha!
           Just try it, amigo.RICKI will!
                         
          Rick turns to go. JulieErnie rush over and try to reason
          with him quietly.52.JULIERick, wait.ERNIEYeah. Don't go off half-cocked.

           Coogan. Look, Juan's a good dog, a
           smart dog. I'll talk to him.

           do it without us.RICKForget it! I don't need you, EES,

          DING DING DING! The letters in the Wheel of Fortune board
          light up, and ROSIE turns them over to reveal "Crud Sucking
          Pus Monkeys" as the secret phrase. Everyone claps despite
          themselves. Juan stares them down. They stop.
                         
          Rick storms off in a huff. Juan takes Julie's hand and gazes
          deep into her eyes. He kisses her passionately. Julie is
          watching Rick leave. Juan nibbles her neck, which gets her
          attention. She scratches Juan behind his ear. His leg
          instinctively kicks the air. Ernie looks worried.ERNIEI'm getting a bad feeling here.CUT TO:INT. REAR CORNER OF FREAK HOUSE - DAYOut of sight from the others, Rick approaches the rear door
          and tries it. It doesn't open from the inside.RICKDamn.
                         
          He peers out through a crack in the door and sees a MILKMAN
          getting out of his truck in the driveway.RICK(TO MILKMAN)Psst! Hey, you. Milkman!53.OUTSIDEThe milkman looks over at the outhouse, suspicious.MILKMANYeah... ?RICK (V.0.)Just the man I'm lookinq for. Be a

           someone to open that door. Well

          He's about to walk away.RICKOkay. Guess I'll just have to milk
           the world's biggest breasted woman
           all by myself. Sorry to bother
           you.
                         
          The milkman stops in his tracks. He tiptoes over to the back
          door of the outhouse, listening intently as Rick goes into
          his "act."RICK(in a lusty womanishVOICE)Ooohh... Milk me! Milk me now!
           Milk me hard!
           (Normal Rick voice)

           Geez. I don't care if Elijah did
           give you skim milk on the right
           side, chocolate on the left, and
           eggnog in the middle.
                         
          The milkman is salivating at the door.MILKMAN(TO HIMSELF)Gee, I love eggnog!
                         
          The milkman opens the door eagerly and steps inside. Beat.MILKMANHey, what the--
                         
          BONK. We hear the sound of bottled buttermilk beaning his
          soft noggin. Rick walks out wearing the milkman outfit
          complete with the little six-milk-bottle-carrier thing.54.He looks around and heads for the milk truck, whistling
          casually. He notices something. It's ...THE GIANT ELIJAH HEADIts big eyes are staring at Rick (note: there's a skywriter
          plane in the distance behind the head, which finishes writing
          "YOU GOT THE RIGHT ONE BABY: PEPSI") Rick gets to the truck
          and tries the door. It's locked.RICKShit.
                         
          He looks over at the giant head. The eyes are still staring
          at him--they seem to have shifted. Rick shrugs it off and
          looks around. He walks over to Elijah's car. It's locked
          too. He checks the big eyes. They've moved again.
                         
          Rick's getting a bit desperate. He sees something else and
          runs towards it. It's a dry-docked motorboat. It's locked
          too. The eyes have followed Rick again. He sees something
          else and runs over to it. It's a bag of golf clubs leaning
          against Elijah's porch. They're locked too.RICKDamn! This guy doesn't trust
           anybody!
                         
          He looks at the giant head- the eyes are gone, leaving only
          empty eyesockets! Rick hears A BURST OF MACHINEGUN FIRE
          behind him, spins around and faces ...TWO THREE FOOT HIGH EYEBALLSwith little arms and legs, wearing Jamaican Rasta hats and
          aiming smoking Uzi 9mms in the air. They aim their Uzis at
          Rick. One holds a walkie-talkie, the other holds a big

          Rick looks worried as they lead him towards the scary looking
          house.INT. ELIJAH'S DENIt's a lovely, suburban den with a coffee table full of
          magazines like "Better Homes and Gardens," "National Review"
          and "Freaks Illustrated". Elijah sits in a big Barcalounger,
          smoking a pipe. Rick sits on the sofa. Toad walks up with a
          tray of soft drinks.ELIJAH(TO RICK)Diet soda?RICKNo thanks.
                         
          Elijah points to a bowl of Fiddle Faddle. Toad sits beside

          Elijah grabs a big mail bag and spills some letters out on
          the table. Elijah opens one and reads it.ELIJAH(READING)Dear Mister Skuggs, I was shocked

          On the other end of the line, we hear LAUGHING MAN's insane
          chuckle. Elijah's smooth smile fades. He turns his back to-
          Rick, who strains to identify the familiar laughing voice.
          Elijah scribbles notes on a pad by the phone.ELIJAHYes... Right... Tomorrow...

          poker in hand, and pokes at the coals angrily.ELIJAHOkay, Coogan. I'm finished with

          As he walks towards the Freak House, Rick pulls out the note
          he pocketed. A gust of wind blows it away from him. He
          chases it behind the carnival tent where...

          way around the corner, each carrying their own six-pack of
          milkbottles. Startled, they turn around. Why, it's the
          freaks! And they're all dressed as milkmen! Cowboy carries
          the hammer, who's dressed in a little milkman suit as well.BEARDED LADYHey Rick, I thought you were gonna

          he knows the Eyeballs will spot them.59.Julie glances at him a second, then looks away. His mind
          made up, Rick takes a deep breath.RICKAh, shit.
                         
          He runs over to the Freaks. He stands in Juan's way.RICKLook, you'll all be killed. You

          This is it. Rick and Juan square off. Juan growls and bares
          his teeth. Rick's MONSTER EYE starts to glow and pulse
          dimly. They circle each other. The others are transfixed.ELIJAH'S POVHe peers through a side window, and sees the pack of milkmen
          cheering two of their coworkers, locked in mortal combat.ELIJAHThat's a lot of milkmen on the same

          Stuey heads towards the Pepsi cup. He brushes against the
          back of Hertz's legs. Hertz looks over at Elijah beside him,

          executives who occupy the front seats. The security goons
          are strategically situated throughout the tent, and two of
          them sit on either side of Stuey in the second row. Elijah
          is onstage.ELIJAHAnd now the moment you've all been

          Toad pulls a rope and the curtain opens, revealing Rick
          strapped to an operating table. On stage left there's a
          large cage containing all the other freaks. Including the
          unconscious, half-naked Milk Man who Rick knocked out in the
          freak house. The Milk Man domes to, looks around in a panic,
          grabs the bars of the cage, and screams--MILK MANAAHHHH! WE'RE IN A ZOO!Rick searches the cheering audience for Stuey, who waves the
          Pepsi cup full of glop in the air. Rick hears Stuey's voice
          echo in his head telepathically.STUEY (V.0.)Rick! Over here!
                         
          Stuey's waving cup is blocking the view of a big, annoyed
          BIKER sitting behind him. Elijah quiets the crowd and holds
          up a beaker of ointment.90.ELIJAHWith this remarkable ointment of my
           own design, I will now turn this

           evil!
                         
          Elijah puts on some rubber gloves and prepares to glop Rick,
          who squints under the spotlight, still searching for Stuey.
          He calls out telepathically.RICK (V.0.)Stuey! Where are you?!
                         
          Stuey stands up on his seat and waves the cup, totally
          blocking the biker's view. He telepathically replies.STUEY (V.0.)Here I am, Rick!BIKER(TO STUEY)Goddammit, kid! Would you sit
           down!?
                         
          The biker grabs the cup and dumps it over Stuey's head. The
          "good ointment" runs down all over Stuey's body.STUEYAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!All eyes turn to Stuey, who falls down and disappears onto
          the floor screaming.RICKOh no!BIKERWhat the hell!?
                         
          Suddenly an EIGHT FOOT TALL MONSTER VERSION OF STUEY leaps to
          its feet and snarls down at the biker. The biker pulls a
          switchblade and jams it into Stuey monster's leg--the blade
          crumples on his armor-like hide. Stuey grins and SLAM! He
          drives the biker into the ground like a railroad spike. He
          leaps onto the stage and stalks Elijah.STUEY MONSTERYOUR ASS IS MINE, SKUGGS!Rick and the freaks in the cage cheer stuey Monster on.ELIJAHUh-oh, that kid looks pissed. EYEAND EYE!

          at their mouths.ELIJAHLet's get this over with. Hey

          Elijah turns to an alarm box on the wall which reads "BREAK
          GLASS IN CASE OF DOUBLECROSSING CORPORATE GREASEBALLS." He
          breaks the glass and pulls the lever inside.94.A trapdoor on the stage opens and a large chemical tank rises
          out of it. Elijah jumps into the seat of the gun turret
          nozzle atop the tank. He aims the nozzle at the EES group.ELIJAHLet me proudly introduce the latest

          yellow glop on the EES people. They scream in agony as their
          bodies melt together into one big mutating blob.

          Cooke like a roach.RICK MONSTERflips Stuey onto the ground and starts stomping on him.
          Stuey is knocked out cold. Rick leaves him on the floor and

          He rips some bars off the cage and is about to spear
          JulieErnie with a jagged steel bar when Stuey Monster grabs
          his leg and trips him. Stuey summons all his remaining
          energy to wrestle Rick, delaying him, for the moment, from
          slaughtering the freaks.

          and is about to glop them when Rick stands up above Stuey,
          blocking Elijah's trajectory at the freak cage. Rick raises
          the jagged bar above Stuey, ready to drive it down through

          The voice keeps echoing. A tear wells up in Rick Monster's
          eye. He looks over at Cowboy, who is actually calling out to
          him from the cage.COWBOYYour heart... your heart... your
           heart...
                         
          Rick Monster loses his murderous glare. He breaks into a
          warm smile, throws the pipe away and helps Stuey Monster up.

          flying through the air. He lands on the DUNK TANK SEAT over
          the bubbling Noxon/Acid. Dazed, he looks at the bullseye
          target, and back at Rick. Summoning up his last ounce of

          the horrified reactions of the freaks as they look on.CUT TO:INT. REGIS AND KATHIE LEE SETRick, Regis, and Kathie Lee are still in silhouette.RICKYAnd that's my story.KATHIE LEE(YAWN)It was so exciting!REGISAnd long! My God! It makes War
           and Peace sound like a warm up act!CREW GUY(O.S.)Okay! We got light!REGISIt's fixed? Well, it's about time!
                         
          The lights come on--no more silhouettes. Ricky looks
          perfectly normal, his old self. His weird silhouette was
          caused by a potted plant and some strange hanging mobile
          behind him.RICKYThat's better.REGISI'll say.(TO AUDIENCE)How 'bout it, folks. Let's hear it
           for Ricky Coogan!
                         
          The audience applauds and hoots wildly.KATHIE LEECan we bring out the other freaks
           now?
                         
          The audience cheers as the rest of the Freaks walk out from
          the wings, and stand off to the side waving to the audience.
          They all look clean cut and happy. They wear T-shirts with
          their former identities printed on them. "I was NOSEY," "I
          was COWBOY," "I was the BEARDED LADY" etc. Except the Worm,
          who's still a worm. His T-shirt says, "I'm Still THE WORM".102.WORMRidiculous... Just because a man
           doesn't like macaroons...
           Nonsense.
                         
          Suddenly a squirrel runs across stage, followed by Juan. He
          pounces and catches the furry little bugger.JUANGotcha! Damn, it's about time!ALL THE EX-FREAKS(happy to see him)JUAN!JUANHey guys! Jeez! You look great!
                         
          They all hug.REGISThat's just great. What a story.
           And what an ending! Elijah
           transformed by the goop!KATHIE LEEAnd he really looked like--?RICKExactly like you two, I swear.
           Same faces, same outfits, except
           they had these really big, hideous
           feet...
                         
          He looks down at Regis and KATHIE LEE's feet--they're big,
          hideous monster feet! Suddenly their eyes glow bright red--
          It's Elijus and Elly Lee! They speak with Elijah's voice.ELIJUSShow's over, Ricky!ELLY LEEI'm gonna drink your blood!
                         
          Elly Lee pulls a machete and is about to force it down on
          Rick's throat when...
                         
          BANG! BANG! BANG! Elijus and Elly Lee's eyes go funny.
          They look at each other, spit up some blood, wave to the
          audience one last time, and collapse to the floor. Julie
          stands behind them, smoking gun in hand. She rushes to Rick.
          They embrace.JULIERick! It's finally over!103.RICKYes... Yes it is.STUEY(O.C.)Rick! Rick!
                         
          Rick and Julie turn and see Stuey, still a ten foot tall
          monster, running towards them. He's carrying a garbage bag
          dripping blood.RICKStuey!STUEYLook! I found the real Regis and
           Kathie Lee!
                         
          Rick and Julie look at the bag, mortified. Stuey chuckles.STUEY (CONT'D)No, this is just my lunch!
                         
          Rick and Julie sigh with relief. Stuey pulls out a similar
          leaking bag and holds it up.STUEY(matter of fact)
           This is Regis and Kathie Lee.
                         
          Rick and Julie nod casually--"Oh."AUDIENCEAwwww!
                         
          Suddenly Elijus and Elly Lee pop up from behind the couch,
          bloodied, but still fierce. They're about to stab Rick and
          Julie when...
                         
          BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! Five more shots ring out
          and they fall dead--again.
                         
          Ernie stands off to the side with a smoking gun.ERNIEOh, like that wasn't totally
           predictable.JULIEWell, now it really is over.
                         
          Sappy END OF THE MOVIE MUSIC wells up.RICKThank God. You know, this
           adventure has taught me something.(MORE)104.RICK(CONT'D)When man starts impinging on the
           subtle perfection of the earth's
           natural order, the only thing he'll
           create is havoc.ERNIERight, Coog. I learned somethin'
           too. That men and women truly are
           equals. That the human spirit
           transcends gender and physical
           appearance, and thus it is immune
           to the petty degradations men may
           devise. I believe it was MoliereWHO SAID--Julie's had enough. She socks Ernie square on the jaw.JULIEOh, shut up.
           (She turns to Rick)
           Let's go fuck.
                         
          Rick gives her the thumbs up. They turn to the audience.RICK/JULIE/ERNIE/STUEY MONSTERGood night, everybody!
                         
          The audience cheers. The HIT SINGLE from the soundtrack
          album kicks in as we...ROLL CREDITSAs the credits roll, and everybody continues to smile and
          wave at the cheering audience, Elijus and Elly Lee attack
          again. Ernie hands the gun to Stuey, who shoots them dead.
          Well, dead-ish. Seconds later, after some more waving, they
          attack again. This time Nosey and the Bearded Lady stab them
          to death, sort of. A little more waving, before Elijus and
          Elly Lee make another pathetic attempt. They can barely
          stand. Cowboy clubs one with a mic stand. Worm head-butts
          the other. A few seconds later, Elijus's bloodied hand
          gropes its way over the top of the studio couch. Stuey has
          to prop him up while members of the audience are invited down
          to punch him in the chops. Ernie stands off to the side,
          charging everyone five bucks per blow.
                         
          As we fade, everyone's having a go flipping, throwing,
          kicking and impaling rag doll replicas of America's favorite
          morning show hosts.THE END?!
