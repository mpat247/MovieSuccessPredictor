                                                  February 1, 1998EXT. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SUBURB, MAIN DRAG - DAYPalms sway ... the sun washes everything in yellow ... cars
     motor down either side of the landscaped median ... the calls
     of mockingbirds mingle with the BLIP BLIP of car alarms.

     ON THE SIDEWALK, a SKATEBOARD CA-LUNKS down the sidewalk,
     past the foot traffic of Southern Californians: flip-flops,
     Doc Marten's, Rollerblades, Nikes ... then, in the middle of
     this pedestrian normalcy, a pair of IMPOSSIBLY HIGH SPIKE-
     HEELED PUMPS struts out of a shop.  So high it hurts to look
     at them.  As the shoes leave frame, we TILT UP and see
     they're leaving a 99-cent store.

     As the Pumps turn and head up the street, we see they are
     connected to a pair of IMPOSSIBLY LONG, SHAPELY LEGS.
     Eveready legs -- they just keep going and going.

     They saunter past two BUSINESSMEN on a lunch break.  The men
     pause and glance as men tend to when they see a beautiful
     woman.  In fact, everyone this woman passes lets their eyes
     rest on her a microsecond longer than usual.

     - Two SKATEBOARDERS note the STRETCHY MICRO-MINI skimming the
     tops of her thighs.

     - A MAILMAN spots the BIG, DARK SUNGLASSES tucked into aMOUNTAIN OF BIG, BLOND HAIR.- A PRE-TEEN GIRL glimpses the PLUNGING NECKLINE of theTIGHT, BRIGHT RED MIDRIFF-BARING BUSTIER.It isn't until she rounds the corner at the end of the block
     that we see her entire figure and appreciate why everyone is
     so goggle-eyed.  Eye-catching is an understatement.  All
     those folks who say Barbie's proportions are unrealistic have
     obviously never met ERIN BROCKOVICH.EXT. AROUND THE CORNER - DAYA side street.  No pedestrians, just parked cars.  A PARKING
     TICKET flaps under the wiper of an old Hyundai.ERINFuck.

     Even when she talks dirty, there's a heartland goodness to
     her voice.  Like Kansas corn fields swaying in the breeze.

     As she grabs the ticket from the windshield, her sunglasses
     accidentally CLATTER to the ground.ERINShit.

     When she picks them up, a fingernail snags on the pavement.ERINGoddamnit.

     She tends to the nail as she opens her car door and gets in.WIDER ON THE STREETThe Hyundai starts it up, signals.  Then, just as it pulls
     slowly out into the street, a JAGUAR barrels around the
     corner, accelerating out of the turn, and rams into the side
     of Erin's car, sending it CAREENING into the median.  It
     SMASHES into a foot-thick lightpost.  And stops.EXT. MASRY & VITITOE - DAYA boring building on a boring block in the Valley, surrounded
     by strip malls.  Definitely not where the power lawyers work.ROSALIND (O.S.)Morning, Mr. Masry.  How you doing today?INT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION - DAYGeneric.  Cottage cheese ceilings, motel art.  A sign over
     the reception desk reads: MASRY & VITITOE, ATTORNEYS AT LAW.

     ED MASRY, senior partner, slumps by ROSALIND, his chipper
     receptionist, with a cup of coffee in his hand.  He's in his
     mid-50's, compact and -- even though it's only 9 AM --
     already rumpled.EDDon't ask that on Mondays, Rosalind.

     Whatever passion he once had for the personal injury law that
     is his career has long since dissipated.  He trundles off
     toward his office.INT. MASRY & VITITOE, OUTSIDE ED'S OFFICE - DAYEd's secretary BRENDA -- 50's, jaded, hates her job, but what
     can you do? -- is on the phone when Ed rounds the corner.
     She puts the call on hold, turns to Ed.BRENDATony Marvin.EDOh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain
            and suffering this time?BRENDAHis dry cleaners.  You want him?EDWhat do you think?  What's this?

     He grabs a gift-wrapped bottle off her desk, reads the card.BRENDATequila.  From your drug dealer friend.EDCarlos isn't a friend; he's a client.BRENDAHe's a low-life.  Speaking of which, that's
            your nine o'clock in there.

     Ed peers into his office.  It's a mess -- papers everywhere,
     unopened mail.  Standing in the middle of the room is Erin,
     in a teensy, leopard-print mini-dress.  As she jiggles a
     spike-heeled foot, everything about her shimmies gloriously.
     Except her head, which is held in place by a neck brace.EDWhoa.
                        (to Brenda)
            Remind me.BRENDAErin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her
            fault, she says.
                        (sarcastic)
            And she looks like such an honest girl, don't
            you think?EDYou shouldn't judge, Brenda.BRENDARight.  Lap-dancers are people too.

     As Ed heads into his office, Brenda picks up the phone.BRENDAI can't find him, Tony.  We'll have to call
            you back.INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAYNot an office that exudes authority, and Ed's blustery
     entrance only adds to the sense of chaos.EDErin -- hi.  Sorry you had to wait.  Here,
            sit down, sit down.

     He clears a stack of papers off a chair.ERINThanks a lot.
                        (as she sits)
            I tell you, I never thought just standing
            would take it out of me, but ever since that
            shithead hit me, it feels like my whole
            body's put together wrong.

     Ed gives her a look of pro-forma sympathy.EDJesus, you poor thing.
                        (he sits)
            Well, listen, you came to the right place.
            Whoever did this to you made one hell of a
            mistake, and you and me, we're gonna make
            him pay for it.

     He takes out a pad and paper, gets ready to write.EDWhy don't you tell me what happened?DISSOLVE TO:INT. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COURTROOM - DAYErin is on the stand, wearing the most conservative thing she
     owns: a red, form-fitting mini dress, telling her story to
     Ed, who's questioning her.ERINI was pulling out real slow, and out of
            nowhere, his Jaguar comes racing around the
            corner like a bat outta hell ...

     She glances at the defendant's table, where a DOCTOR sits
     nobly in surgical scrubs.  His WIFE and two beautiful KIDS
     are behind him.  A frigging Norman Rockwell painting.LATER IN HER TESTIMONY:ERINThey took some bone from my hip and put it
            in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm
            about seventeen thousand in debt right now.STILL LATER:ERIN... couldn't take painkillers cause they
            made me too groggy to take care of my kids.STILL LATER:ERIN... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's
            just nine months.STILL LATER:ERIN... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person,
            a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care
            of my kids.  You know?ED(oh so moved)
            Yeah.  I know.INT. COURTROOM - LATERErin is still on the stand.  But now the doctor's lawyer is
     questioning her.DEFENDING LAWYERSeventeen thousand in debt.  Whew.  Is your
            ex-husband helping out?ERINWhich one?DEFENDING LAWYER(feigning shock)
            There's more than one?ERINYeah.  There's two.  Why?

     Erin looks over at the jury.  The personification of
     conservative family values.  Oh, shit.LATER IN HER TESTIMONY:ERIN(getting defensive)
            ... not like a career, cause I had my babies.
            But I woulda worked, for sure, if I didn't
            have this neck thing.

     Erin sees a juror staring judgmentally at her short hem.
     Erin gives it a tug, pulling it down a stitch.DEFENDING LAWYER(sarcastic)
            Right.  No doubt.

     Erin sees a few jurors share dubious glances.  Great.STILL LATER:The defendant's lawyers is on the offensive.  Erin's starting
     to feel the case slipping away.DEFENDING LAWYERSo.  You must've been feeling pretty
            desperate that afternoon.ERIN(pointed)
            What's your point?

     Ed shakes his head slightly to her -- don't get mad.DEFENDING LAWYERBroke, three kids, no job.  A doctor in a
            Jaguar must've looked like a pretty good
            meal ticket.

     Erin sees jurors nodding almost imperceptibly in agreement.
     She's on a sinking ship.ERINWhat?  Hey --hehitme.DEFENDING LAWYERSo you say.ERINHe came tearing around the corner, out of
            control --DEFENDING LAWYERAn ER doctor who spends his days saving
            lives was the one out of control --ERIN(erupting)
            That asshole smashed in my fucking neck!INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - DAYThe door to the courtroom flies open and Erin comes out,
     furious.  Ed follows her as she heads for the elevator.ERINOpen and shut?Open and fucking shut?EDIf you hadn't used profanity --ERINOh, please, it was long over by then.  God
            damn, he made me look like some cheap --EDI told you the questions might get a little
            personal --ERINBullshit.  You told me I'd get half a
            million dollars.  You told me I'd be set.

     Ed notices her ranting is starting to draw attention.EDOkay -- let's try and settle down here.ERINSettle down?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr.
            Masry!  I can'taffordto settle down!

     Beat.EDI'm sorry, Erin.ERINYeah?  Well, fuck you.  Sorry doesn't feed my
            kids.

     Erin turns away from him and heads for the stairway.EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAYA shitty little house in a shitty part of Northbridge.  The
     Hyundai with a bashed-in side pulls up to the curb.

     Erin gets out, takes the mail from her mailbox, then heads
     over to the equally grim house next door and rings the bell.

     A Hispanic woman in her 60's opens the door, holding a white
     baby.  This is MRS. MORALES.MRS. MORALESHi, Erin!  You're back so soon.  How was it?

     She hands Erin the baby.  It's BETH, Erin's 9-month old.
     Erin avoids the question by focusing on her baby.ERINHi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where
            are Matt and Katie?MRS. MORALESOutside with the sprinkler.  So it's good?

     The truth is too depressing to share.ERINIt'll be fine, yeah.MRS. MORALESAi, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell
            you before, with your worries --ERINWhat?MRS. MORALESMy daughter, she's bought a big house with a
            room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.ERINYou're moving away?  When?MRS. MORALESNext week.ERIN(stunned)
            Wow, that's soon --MRS. MORALESI know.  But it's good for me.  Now I can
            help my daughter take care of my grandkids.
            And it's good for you, too.  Now you have
            money, you can find a good babysitter, huh?
            Not the old lady next door.

     Oh, God.  In Erin's arms, Beth starts to COUGH.EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAYErin carries Beth up to her house.  As she nears her door,
     she steps on a GIANT WATER BUG.  It crunches under her sole.ERINUgh.

     Insult added to injury.  She heads up to the house, dragging
     her shoe, wiping off the bug guts.INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MAIN LIVING/DINING SPACE - DAYJust as dull inside.  Salvation Army furniture.  A lot of
     beige.  Erin's two older kids, MATTHEW (7) and KATIE (5) are
     at the table.  Beth is in a baby seat.  Erin spoons some Mac
     & Cheese onto their plates, trying to hide her worry.MATTHEWI don't like this part, it's all crusty.KATIEI like the crust.

     Erin switches the plates.ERINPut your napkins in your laps and eat up.KATIEHow come you're not eating?

     Cause there isn't enough food.ERINMamma's gonna eat later.

     From her baby seat on the table, Beth COUGHS some more.
     Thick, sick-sounding coughs.  Erin looks at her.ERINDon't go getting sick on me, baby.  Okay?INT. ERIN'S BATHROOM - NIGHTThe shower and sink are both on full, filling the room with
     STEAM.  Erin is seated with COUGHING, CRYING Beth on her lap,
     trying to steam the illness out of her.ERINIt's gonna be okay, sweetheart.  I promise.

     But her face doesn't look like she believes it.EXT. DRUGSTORE - DAYMatt and Katie are messing around with a gumball machine.INT. DRUGSTORE, AISLE - DAYErin is holding Beth, wandering the aisles.  She stops at the
     medicines, thinks for a long moment, then, hating herself,
     glances to make sure no one's looking, and picks up a bottle.INT. DRUGSTORE, AT THE REGISTER - DAYAs a CUSTOMER steps away from the register, Erin steps up
     with the bottle in her hand and smiles at the CHECK-OUT LADY.ERINHi, remember me?  I was in yesterday.  Bought
            a whole mess of stuff?  Round about five?CHECK-OUT LADYHoney, it's a zoo here at five.  I'm lucky
            if I even see a face, much less remember it.ERINOh, shoot, yeah, I guess that'd be tough.
            Well, listen, I meant to buy my baby here
            some medicine, and by the time I got home, I
            realized I'd bought the adult stuff by
            mistake.  And now, wouldn't you know, I
            can't find the receipt.  I was wondering --
            could I maybe exchange it anyway ...INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAYErin feeds Beth her medicine, feeling miserable about it.ERINJust remember.  No matter what your Mamma
            does, lying and stealing is real bad.  I
            don't ever wanna hear you doing something
            like that ...

     On the table beside her sit the classifieds.  Row after row
     of want ads circled, then X-'d out in red.  A WATER BUG
     crawls across the edge of the paper.ERIN... Cause there's no excuse for it, you hear
            me?  No excuse at all.INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAYMidday.  Ed enters with a cup of coffee in his hand.  As he
     heads to his desk, he trips on a box of files.  Coffee
     sloshes out of his cup, onto his shirt.EDDamn it!
                        (calling out)
            Brenda!

     She pops her head in.BRENDAYeah?

     He grabs a tissue, swabs his shirt, then kicks at the box.EDWhat the hell is this doing here?BRENDAIt's those files you asked for.EDI didn't mean for you to leave them in the
            middle of the floor.  Jesus.  Look at me.
            What do I have this afternoon?BRENDANothing you can't show up for with a stain.

     As Ed checks his reflection in the glass wall of his office,
     he notices, on the other side:

     ERIN, standing in the middle of the secretaries' area, in a
     miniskirt and leather bustier, talking to MARIO, the firm's
     mentally challenged office boy.  Mario heads away from her.EDWhat's she doing here?BRENDAWho?

     Ed goes to his office door and waves Mario over.EDHey -- Mario -- what's she doing here?MARIOShe works here.

     Ed looks back at her -- what the hell?INT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAYThe support staff -- mostly middle-aged women -- are all
     stealing glances at Erin.  Ed comes up to her, all friendly.EDErin!  How's it going?

     Up close, the wear and tear of worry show on her face.ERINYou never called me back.  I left messages.EDYou did?  Wow, sorry about that.
                        (beat)
            Listen, Mario's a little not so bright.  He
            seems to think that you said --ERINThere's two things I can't stand, Mr. Masry.
            Being ignored, and being lied to.  You did
            both.

     Glances skitter between the secretaries -- get a load of
     this.  Ed lowers his voice.EDI never lied.  I may have miscalculated --
            that happens sometimes, but --ERINYou said things would be fine, and they're
            not.EDI'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --ERINI don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And
            I've looked, but when you've spent the last
            six years raising babies, it's real hard to
            convince someone to give you a job that pays
            worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the
            one who said I was gonna be okay, you should
            be the one to hire me.

     Ed sees everyone watching him, listening.EDI'd love to help, Erin, but I'm sorry, I
            have a full staff right now, so --

     He starts to escort her out, but she stays put.ERINBullshit.  If you had a full staff, you'd
            have time to return your damn phone calls.

     She's backing him into a corner here.  He shifts gears.EDOkay, look.  If you really want to apply for
            a job here, you can do it the way everyone
            else does.  Send in a r�sum�, make an --ERINI'mnoteveryone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm
            someone you made promises to that you didn't
            deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids'
            well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard-
            working, and I'll do anything.  But if you
            think I'm leaving here without a job, you
            got another thing coming.

     Ed glances around the room.  Not a whole lot of options here.
     He looks back at Erin.EDNo benefits.INT. MASRY & VITITOE, FILE ROOM - DAYA tight office lined with file cabinets and shelves.  ANNA,
     the humorless file clerk, is showing Erin around.ANNA... what we do in here is keep track of all
            the case files.  That way, at any time, we
            can find out a case's status -- where it is
            in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em
            all here, alphabetically --ERINOh, hell.
                        (beat)
            I'm dyslexic.ANNAThat's a joke, right?

     Erin shakes her head, no.  Great, thinks Anna.INT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAYAs Anna shows Erin around the office, they pass JANE, the
     bitter office manager, and Brenda, at the coffee area.JANEJust last week, he told my sister we weren't
            hiring.BRENDAWhat's your sister look like?INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - NIGHTEd is packing up his office.  Erin sticks her head in.ERINMr. Masry?

     He turns, sees her.EDYeah?ERINI was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd
            talk to about maybe getting an advance on my
            paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend.EDJane's the office manager.  She handles
            payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early
            on Fridays.ERINOh.  Okay.  That's okay.

     Ed looks at her a moment, sees that it's far from okay.EDOh, for Christ's sake ...

     He takes out his wallet, looks in.EDAll I have is hundreds.ERINI don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.EDBullshit, you don't.

     He slaps a hundred in her hand and leaves.  When he's gone,
     she looks at the bill -- her life raft -- and gives it a
     great big kiss.EXT. BABYSITTER'S HOUSE - NIGHTErin is at the door, taking Beth from the BABYSITTER, a
     shabby, unkempt-looking woman in her 40's.  Katie and Matt
     pull on their backpacks and troop out of the sitter's house.EXT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHTErin is leaving the store, carrying Beth in one arm and a bag
     of groceries in the other.  Katie and Matt are each carrying
     a bag of groceries as well.  They are all singing and moving
     with the jaunty step of the newly carefree.  Katie spots a
     flower display outside the store.KATIEMommy, can I get a flower?ERINSweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MATT AND KATIE'S ROOM - NIGHTA small room with Salvation Army furniture.  A BUNCH OF
     DAISIES is propped in a Ragu jar on Katie's bedside table.
     Matt and Katie are asleep in bed.  Erin looks down at them,
     smiles, then kisses them good-night.INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHTErin comes out of the bedroom and softly closes the door.
     But just as the handle clicks into place, the house is filled
     with the DEAFENING ROAR of a MOTORCYCLE, REVVING and REVVING.
     It sounds as if it's gonna drive through the wall.EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHTErin steps out onto her front stoop and looks over at what
     used to be Mrs. Morales's house.  A few MOTORCYCLES are
     parked on the lawn; A FEW BIKERS are drinking beer on the
     stoop; and one asshole is on his bike, REVVING HIS ENGINE.ERINHey!

     But of course he can't hear her.  She walks over to him,
     stands right in his line of vision.ERINHEY!He sees her and kills the engine.  Everything about GEORGE
     HALABY is tough -- his denim, his leather, his bike, his long
     hair.  Everything but his eyes, which twinkle like Santa's.GEORGEWell, hello to you, darlin'.ERINWhat the hell do you think you're doing,
            making all that Goddamn noise?GEORGEJust introducing myself to the neighbors.ERINWell, I'm the neighbors.  There, now we're
            introduced, so you can shut the fuck up.

     The guys on the porch chuckle.  Erin turns and starts back to
     her house.  George hops off his bike and follows her.GEORGEOoh, now, see, if I'da known there was a
            beautiful woman next door, I'da done this
            different.  Let's start over.  My name's
            George.  What's yours?ERINJust think of me as the person next door who
            likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.GEORGENow, don't be like that.  Tell you what.
            How about if I take you out on a date to
            apologize for my rudeness?

     landscape like occasional tombstones.

     A beat-up old sign on the road reads: "HINKLEY, CA.  POP: "
     but the  corner where the number would be has broken off.

     As a gust of wind lifts dust from the fields, Erin turns onto
     Community Boulevard, the main road that cuts through Hinkley.INT. ERIN'S HYUNDAI - DAYErin looks around.  The house she's passing has been razed.
     A heap of lumber and wires in the middle of the property.

     As she checks the piece of paper with Donna's address, she
     drives by the PG&E COMPRESSOR STATION, a massive gray
     structure of pipes, chimneys and ladders, set way back from
     the road.  Erin passes it without noticing it.

     She stops at an intersection.  The house on the corner has
     been boarded up with plywood.  Erin notices it -- depressing
     -- then turns the corner onto Donna's street.EXT. DONNA IRVING'S HOUSE - DAYA generic ranch home standing all alone in the middle of

     few BOTTLES OF SPRING WATER wait by the door.

     The Hyundai pulls into the driveway and stops.  Erin gets
     out.  As she heads up to the door, her spike heels sink into
     the dirt.  She rings the bell.  It has a melody chime.

     DONNA IRVING opens the door.  She's 35, petite, with a
     scrappy, high-strung manner.  She's wearing tight jeans, and
     her dark curls are piled on top of her head.ERINHi.  Donna Irving?DONNAYes?ERINI'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?DONNA(a little surprised)

            They make the place feel real homey.

     Donna corrects the positioning on a couple of pillows.DONNAThank you.  I think so too.  That's why I'm
            being such a stickler on this house price
            thing.  I don't mean to be a pain in PG&E's
            backside, especially after all they've done
            for Hinkley, but I look around here and I
            think, if they want this place, they're
            gonna have to pay for it.  And I don't just
            mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay
            me for the trouble of starting over.ERINRight.DONNACause first you gotta move, then there's
            decorating, and if the windows aren't the
            same size, you know -- you're making all new
            curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I
            have the energy.  You know, I've been sick.
            Me and Peter both have.ERINYeah, I'm real glad you brought that up.  I
            was going through your file here, and I ran
            into these medical records.  They kinda
            surprised me --

     This would be the perfect opportunity for many to get self-
     pitying.  But not Donna.  Life's handed her a shitload of
     lemons, and darned if she hasn't made a shitload of lemonade.DONNAI know.  They're more than a bit unusual.
            See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's
            disease.  That's a kind of cancer --ERINYeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.DONNAThank you.  It's in remission now, thank the
            Lord, but you never know.  And then while
            that's going on, I end up having to have a
            hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps
            removed from my breasts.  All benign so far,

            were corresponding with PG&E about it in the
            first place.DONNAWell, they paid for the doctor's visit.ERINThey did?DONNAYou bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole
            family.  And not like with insurance where
            you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed,

            And since we shouldn't have to drink it if
            we don't want to, they gave us free spring
            water and offered to buy our house.

     WIDEN to see Donna pulling the box down into the room.ERINWhat's chromium?DONNAIt's a chemical they used over at that
            compressor station up the road there.ERINWell, hell, maybe that's why you all have
            been so sick --DONNAI thought the same thing, right off the bat.
            That's why we went to see the doctor.  But
            hunh-uh.  Turns out one's got nothing to do
            with the other.

     She rifles through the box.DONNAThis is the info they gave us.  You'll see
            if you look through it, chromium's good for

            Yeah.ERINThank God we got you away from her, huh?

     By now they're all smiling.  Funky Town plays on.EXT. PG&E COMPRESSOR STATION - DAYThe Hyundai is parked at the entrance to the station, by a
     row of dead trees.  Erin is standing beside a sign that says
     "Private Property.  No Trespassing", taking pictures of the
     massive structure in the distance.  Matthew, Katie, and Beth
     are drawing in the dirt with sticks.ERINStay out of the road.  I'll be right back.

     She wanders up the drive, onto PG&E property, moving around
     the plant, taking pictures of it from every possible angle.

     As she wanders over a big, flat, dry field to the side of the
     plant, she glances over her shoulder to check on her kids and
     notices the trail she made in the dirt has a greenish hue.
     She looks at the dirt right her feet.  Kicks the ground.

     Below the surface, the dirt turns from brown to green.  Erin
     notes this, then looks back at her kids playing in the dirt.
     Worry comes over her face.  She heads back to them.EXT. HINKLEY MART - DAYThe kids are waiting at the car.  Erin comes out of the store
     with a bottle of water and uses it to rinse off their hands.EXT. WATER BOARD - DAYThe sound of a BABY CRYING.  The Hyundai's parked in front.MATTHEW (O.S.)I'm hungry.INT. WATER BOARD - DAYErin is at the Xerox machine, copying a file while she tries

     Matthew and Katie are flopping around on the floor.ERINWe'll go eat in a minute.  Settle down.

     Whining, fussing.  Ross goes over to her.ROSSYou know what, Erin?  I got nothing but time
            here.  Why don't you let me do that for you,
            and you can get your kids some dinner.ERINRoss -- you are an absolute angel.

     She hands Ross the STACK OF DOCUMENTS.INT. MASRY & VITITOE, BRENDA'S DESK - DAYEd comes in in the morning, and without pausing, hands Brenda

     He continues into his office and closes the door.CLOSE ON THE FAX MACHINE LEDBrenda types in the number.  The recipient's I.D. comes up on
     the LED: PG&E CLAIMS DEPT.INT. IRVING HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAYAnother copy of those DOCUMENTS, now in Donna's hands.  She's
     on her couch with Erin, reading them.  Outside, Donna's two
     daughters are playing in the pool.  She reads the last page
     and looks up at Erin, bewildered.DONNAAn on-site monitoring well?  That means --ERINIt was right up on the PG&E property over
            there.DONNAAnd you say this stuff, this hexavalent
            chromium -- it's poisonous?ERINYeah.DONNAWell -- then it's gotta be a different than
            what's in our water, cause ours is okay.
            The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right
            in the kitchen and said it was fine.ERINI know.  But the toxicologist I been talking
            to?  He gave me a list of problems that can
            come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And
            everything you all have is on that list.

     Donna resists this idea hard.DONNANo.  Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the
            doctor said.  He said one's got absolutely
            nothing to do with the other.ERINRight, but -- didn't you say he was paid byPG&E?Donna sits quietly, trying to make sense of this.  The only
     sound is the LAUGHING and SPLASHING from the pool out back.
     Then, gradually, Donna realizes what it is she's hearing --
     her kids playing in toxic water.  She jumps up ...DONNAASHLEY!  SHANNA!... and runs out to the pool.  Erin follows her.EXT. DONNA'S HOUSE - DAYFrom the door, Erin watches Donna run to the edge of the pool

     Jane tips her head toward Ed's office, as if to say, check it
     out.  Brenda peers in and sees Erin.BRENDAWhat's she doing here?JANEHe hired her back.  With a raise.BRENDAWhat??Why?JANEWell, let's see.  It's not cause she's
            smart, and it's not cause she's

     Brenda leaves without acknowledging Erin.INT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAYEd and Erin come out and see DAVID BAUM waiting at reception.
     Forget law school, this kid looks like he's just out of
     twelfth grade.  Not a hair on his chin.  His suit and shoes
     look brand new.ERINNot to question your judgment or anything,
            Mr. Masry, but -- that doesn't exactly look
            like sitting up and taking notice to me.INT. MASRY & VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAYEd and Erin are seated across the table from Baum. To say
     this kid lacks authority is a gross understatement.  He
     doesn't talk; he squeaks.BAUM... in the interest of putting this whole
            thing to rest, PG&E is willing to offer the
            Irvings 250,000 dollars for their home.

     Ed laughs a little in disbelief.ED250,000?BAUMIn terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr.
            Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.EDWhat about in terms of medical expenses?
            250,000 doesn't come close to what this
            family's gonna have to spend on doctors.BAUMI understand they've had a bad run of luck,
            health-wise, and they have my sympathies.
            But that's not PG&E's fault.EDYou're kidding, right?
                        (Baum doesn't answer)
            Look at these readings for Christ's sake.
            PG&E's own technicians documented toxic
            levels of hexavalent chromium in those test
            wells, on numerous occasions.

     Ed shoves them across the table.  Baum doesn't look at them.EDEverything the Irvings have had is a proven
            reaction to exposure to hexavalent chromium.
            They've had ...

            disease, immune deficiencies, asthma,
            chronic nosebleeds.

     Despite their persuasiveness, Baum parrots what is obviously
     the party line:BAUMA million things could have caused those
            problems.  Poor diet, bad genes,
            irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final
            and more than fair.EDWait a minute -- I thought we were
            negotiating here.BAUM250,000 is all I'm authorized to offer.

            I will present your offer to my clients.  I
            doubt they'll accept it.

     As Ed starts out:BAUMMr. Masry, before you go off on some
            crusade, you might want to remember who it
            is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28-
            billion dollar corporation.ED(containing his anger)
            Thanks.  I'll keep it in mind.

     And Ed leaves the conference room.  Erin follows him out.INT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAYErin follows Ed as he stomps back to his office.ERINAt least they made an offer.EDThat wasn't an offer.  A million would've
            been an offer.  When they send the God damn
            mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my
            time, it's a fuck you.ERINI don't get why they'd do that.EDBecause they can.  You heard that kid --
            they have 28 billion dollars at their
            disposal.  They can afford to waste all the
            time in the world.ERINAnd you can't?EDWhat, you think I'm made of money?

     Behind them, Baum steps out of the conference room.BAUMHey, you know where I can get a cab?  My
            plane leaves Burbank in forty-five minutes.

     Ed turns and looks at him.  He gets a tiny smile.EDTell you what, why don't you go on over to
            reception, tell them I said Mario should
            take you to the airport.BAUMHey, excellent.  Thanks.

     Baum heads out to the reception area.ERINMr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the
            bathroom.  They'll be driving around the
            valley for hours.ED(gleeful)
            Yeah.  Isn't that a shame?

     She watches him go into his office, impressed.  Big smile.ERINWell I'll be God damned.INT. MASRY & VITITOE, OUTSIDE ED'S OFFICE - NIGHTEnd of the day.  Most everyone has left.  Erin is at her new
     work space near Ed's office.  She's poring over a fat file of
     documents.  ROSALIND wanders by with her coat on.ROSALINDYou've been reading for hours.ERINI'm a slow reader, on account of the fact
            that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".ROSALINDHey, just so long as you see Him.

     Rosalind turns on Erin's desk lamp and heads out.

     Outside the big glass office doors, Rosalind stops to talk to
     a lost-looking COUPLE IN THEIR MID-30's.  These are MANDY and
     TOM BROWN.  He's a security guard uniform, with an envelope
     under his arm.  Rosalind points to Erin.  The Browns enter
     the office and approach her.MANDYExcuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?ERINYeah.  Who are you?TOMI'm Tom Brown.  This is my wife Mandy.  We
            used to live across the street from the

            told her about the chromium, we figured that
            might have something to do with this, too.ERINIt sure could, yeah.  Thanks a lot.

     She tucks them into a file, as if that's it.MANDYThere's something else, too.ERINWhat?TOMWell.  Mandy here's had nine miscarriages.ERINAre you kidding?  My God --MANDYI know.  It's an awful lot.ERINI'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.TOMShe doesn't know.  No one does.  It's not

            took birth control pills.  But then Donna

            just shut out the light a few seconds ago.

     Whatever.  Erin glances at the speedometer.  Oy.  So slow.
     His car phone rings.  He picks it up.EDHello? ...

            did, too, you just didn't feel it.

     He starts swerving across the lane markers.  THWACK THWACK
     THWACK.  Ed doesn't notice.  Erin's getting nervous.EDYou think I could leave without kissing my
            babys?  Okay, here you go.

     He kisses into the phone.  Swerves.  A car barely misses
     them.  Erin's eyes widen.  Not fun at all.EDBye-bye ... bye-bye ... no, you.  Okay,
            together.  Bye-bye.

            don't quite understand, Mr. Masry.INT. DONNA IRVING'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHTDonna and Pete Irving, and Mandy and Roy Brown are all
     seated, sipping iced tea.  While they talk, Erin hands them
     all information packets on chromium.  Ed is standing in front
     of them, a little stiff.PETEIf PG&E messed with our water, why would
            they bother saying anything about it to us?
            Why not just keep quiet about it?EDTo establish a statute of limitations.  See,
            in a case like this, you only have a year
            from the time you first learn about the
            problem to file suit.  So PG&E figures,
            we'll let the cat out of the bag -- tell the
            people the water's not perfect; if we can
            ride out the year with no one suing, we'll
            be in the clear forever.DONNABut it was more than a year ago that they
            told us --EDIt's okay.  We're not suing.  All we're
            doing is using this information to get you
            a real nice purchase price on your house,

            your sale price.  This way, and PG&E can
            still look good to their shareholders, cause
            they're not involved in an ugly lawsuit; all
            they're doing is buying a little property.

     Roy looks up from his retainer agreement.ROYIt doesn't say here how much this whole
            thing's gonna cost us.EDMy fee's forty percent of whatever you get
            awarded.

     Erin watches them look around at each other, stunned by the
     figure.ERINBoy, do I know how you feel.  First time I
            heard that number, I said you got to be
            kidding me.  Forty God damn percent?EDErin --ERINI'm the one who's injured, and this joker

     Erin's enjoying Ed's discomfort almost too much to stop.  But
     just almost.  She shifts gears.ERINThen I asked him how much he makes if I
            didn't get anything.

     They look at Ed.  Well?EDThen I don't get anything either.ERINAnd I realized, he's taking a chance too.

     When they hear this, and realize he's in it with them, they
     all reach for their pens and sign.   They hand the agreements
     over to Erin, who takes them across the room to Ed.  He
     stuffs them in his briefcase and closes it up.  That's that.EDAll right, then.  Let's hit the road.

     Boy.  Cold as ice.  Erin stares at him, stunned by his
     brusque manner, then leans in to him, close.ERIN(whispering)
            Mr. Masry, if you don't mind my saying, you

            pleasant conversation.

     She gives him a stern look, then turns toward the women.ERINDonna, let me help you clean all this up.

     She picks up a tray of iced tea and cookies and heads to the

            hysterectomy at age 20, like Rosa Diaz -- a
            client of ours -- or have their spine
            deteriorate like Stan Bloom.  Another client

     Then she spots, behind some bushes across the street, a glint
     of chrome.  She shields her eyes against the sunset and sees:
     the BEAT-UP TRUCK parked behind some shrubbery.

     Erin looks around, realizes she's alone.  As she looks back
     at the truck, the ASH of a cigarette brightens in the cab.
     She realizes she's being watched.  The driver's door opens.

     Erin bolts for her car, scrambling to find her keys.  She
     jumps in, locks her doors, and tries to start her car, but it
     won't turn over.  Panic.  The Man in the Dark Glasses has
     gotten out and is heading toward her car. Erin looks around
     again.  Not a soul.  She tries the engine again.  And again.

     Just as he gets to her car, the engine engages.  Erin peels
     out of the gas station.INT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHTErin drives down the road, hyperventilating, trying to focus
     on the road.  She looks in the rear-view mirror -- nothing.

     She reaches the train tracks.  A train is passing.  She has
     to stop.  As she's waiting, the glint of headlights bounce
     off her rear view mirror.  Truck lights, coming her way.
     Fuck.  She looks at the train -- still passing -- then back
     at the headlights closing in on her.  The train, the
     headlights, the train, the headlights ...

     truck.   A little later, she makes a turn and sees THE LOST

     Mercedes.  She pulls into the drive and jumps out of her car.INT. LOST CAUSE SALOON - NIGHTEd is eating ribs when Erin bursts through the door.  She
     rushes over to him, near tears with fear and exhaustion.ERINSomeone's following me.EDWhat?  Who?ERINSome guy in a truck -- he waited till I was

            if there's anything -- funny sound, whatever

     It's as tender as she gets, and he's moved by it.  They look
     at each other.  Maybe even considering.  But after a long
     beat, she reaches for her door again.  Moment over.EDI'm triple locking my door, so don't even

            Maybe that's why they picked me for the job.
            Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.INT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION AREA - DAYRosalind is at the desk.  Anna, Brenda, and Jane are helping
     themselves to coffee.  Erin enters, with a big box in her
     arms and a whole lot of attitude.ERINHey, Ros, where are they?ROSALINDIn the conference --

     But Erin's spotted them and headed off before Rosalind can
     finish.  Anna, Brenda and Jane notice the purpose in her
     gait.  They watch her with interest.INT. MASRY & VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAYThe table is covered with boxes of documents: the anticipated
     slew of paper that PG&E is sending them.  Ed, Kurt, Theresa,
     Andrew and ABOUT FIVE PARALEGALS are sifting through them.

     Erin breezes in like sunshine.ERINMorning!EDErin?  What are you --ERIN(ignoring Ed)
            You know what, Mr. Potter?  I completely
            forgot your birthday this year.  And seeing
            as how you've been so good to me, I think
            that is a terrible oversight.  So what I
            been doing over the last few days is I've
            been putting together a present for you.

     She plunks the box down on the table.  Potter opens the top
     of the box.  Looks in.ERIN635.  They all signed.  Every single one.

     IN THE DOORWAY, Anna, Brenda and Jane appear, wondering
     what's up.  A huge smile of appreciation slowly spreads
     across Ed's face.EDHo - ly - shit.ERINOh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a
            little something for you, too.

     Erin hands Ed a manila envelope.  He opens it.ERINInternal PG&E documents, all about the
            contamination.  The one I like best says,
            and I'm paraphrasing here, but it says yes,
            the water's poisonous, but it'd be better
            for all involved if this matter wasn't
            discussed with the neighbors.  It's to the
            Hinkley station, from PG&E Headquarters.
            Stamped received, March, 1966.

     Potter and Theresa reel.  Ed shakes his head in disbelief.POTTERWhere did -- how did you do this?ERINWell, what with me not having any brains or
            legal expertise, I just went on up there and
            performed sexual favors.  635 blow jobs in
            five days.  Whew, am I ever tired.

     And she struts out of the room, leaving everyone slack-jawed.
     The CLIP CLIP CLIP of her heels carry her away.EXT. MASRY & VITITOE BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAYErin comes out of the office, flushed with success, and heads
     down the hall.  She presses the elevator button.  The doors
     open.  As she steps on, Ed comes out of the office.EDHey!

            Erin.  The luckiest son of a bitch in
            history.

     He looks down the hall at her, standing so tall and proud in
     the elevator.  He walks toward her, stops right outside the
     elevator.EDBut I know you're not gonna quit on me.ERINHow do you know that?ED(with a smile)
            Cause you got a little voice in your head
            saying, do the right thing.  Give him
            another chance.

     Of course she will.  She releases her hand so he won't see
     her smiling.  Ed watches the doors close.DISSOLVE TO:EXT. PCH - DAYOne of those days when the bay sparkles like a glitter ball.

     She reels.  After a breathless beat:DONNAI don't even know how much money that is.ERINIt's enough -- for whatever you need, for
            whatever your girls need, for whatever your
            girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.
