      out from behind   the sheet   of plywood, holding the ax in
      his hand and as   he moves   toward the front of the car, she
      screams.
      He lifts the ax over his head and swings it down vio-
      lently, cleaving the blade into the hood of the Mercedes.

      The man begins stalking around the front of the car
      toward her. She grabs one of Helen's crutches and raises
      it up as if to hit him. As he steps back to the ax and
      tries to extract it from the hood, she suddenly rushes at
      him and begins belaboring him with the crutch. He lifts
      an arm to fend off the blows while his other hand con-
      tinues to tug at the ax handle.JOANHelen!   Help me!HELENI can't!   I can't move!!

      Raising both arms to protect himself, the man is forced
      to give ground, moving further back into the garage, with
      Joan continuing to batter at him. Then in a sudden burst
      of rage he grabs hold of the crutch, yanks it from her
