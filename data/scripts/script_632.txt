                               Diablo Cody9/20/2007INT. LEECH LAKE WOMEN'S CORRECTIONAL HOSPITAL - DAYANITA "NEEDY" LESNICKI, 17, sits on her hospital bed in
          pajamas. She's a plain-faced girl with a haunted
          expression. As she stares out the window, she winds
          colored yarn around a pair of Popsicle sticks to create a
          "god's eye."Out a single window, we see an imposing nine-footSECURITY FENCE.Next to Needy, we see a pile of unopened mail scattered
          casually on the floor. There are letters, packages, even
          creepy little gifts and totems sent by admiring "fans."NEEDY V.O.Every day, I get letters. I think
                    I get more letters than Santa
                    Claus, Zac Efron and Dr. Phil
                    combined. I'm kind of the shit.RAYMUNDO, a counselor raps on the door and sticks his
          head in cautiously.RAYMUNDORec time in five minutes, Needy.NEEDYGrassy-ass, Raymundo.Needy stands up and begins changing into an institutional
          gym uniform. As she slips off her pajamas, we can see a
          series of puffy, slash-like SCARS on her body.NEEDY V.O.Sometimes the letters are from
                    people who say they're praying for
                    me. They tell me everything will
                    be okay if I just accept Jesus
                    Christ into my heart. I say the
                    words, but nothing ever happens.
                    Nobody comes back. Nobody gets off
                    the cross.She glances sadly at a PHOTO OF A BOY on her dresser. She
          touches the frame wistfully, her eyes full of remorse.NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)Occasionally I get presents from
                    starfuckers who saw my picture in
                    the paper and want to marry me or
                    something. They think they can
                    take me away from all this.(MORE)(CONTINUED)2.CONTINUED:NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)Like I'd really date some

                    but I'm not desperate.We see a morbid "hall of fame" of creepy photos sent in
          from guys. They line the mirror, grinning at us. There's
          even a DICK SHOT tucked in there.Needy pulls on her threadbare uniform T-shirt. It hangs
          down to her knees, covering her shorts.NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)A lot of people ask me if I'm
                    sorry I did it.Needy picks up a paper cup of COLORFUL PILLS on her
          dresser, dumps the meds into her mouth, and dry-swallows
          them.NEEDY(ALOUD)I'm sorry I didn't do it sooner.She saunters out of the room in her GYM UNIFORM and BUNNYSLIPPERS.INT. LEECH LAKE HOSPITAL GYMNASIUM - MORNINGSeveral badminton courts are set up in the gym. As an
          intense OPERATIC ARIA plays over the public address
          system, the FEMALE PATIENTS enthusiastically--almost
          violently--whack at the flying shuttlecocks.The patients appear to be varying levels of crazy. A
          TOOTHLESS WOMAN grins as she dives with her racket,
          clipping her partner in the leg. In the corner, one
          forlorn patient nurses her injured arm while another
          hurls her racket against the wall again and again.
          Counselors look on approvingly, despite how miserable
          their charges appear. In the background, a few sulking
          patients jump rope.Needy enters the gym unnoticed, padding along in her
          bunny slippers.NEEDY V.O.Welcome to the Mental Olympics.
                    They're big on recreation here.
                    Supposedly it helps us vent our
                    aggressions. We've traded in our

          They grab trays and settle into noisy cliques. Needy
          selects a single toaster pastry from the breakfast line
          and sits down, alone.NEEDY V.O.Personally, I think they're trying
                    to wear us out. Keep us sluggish
                    so there won't be an uprising.
                    Well, those J.V. tactics won't
                    work against me. I'm a kicker. K-I-
                    C-K-E-R. It even says so on my
                    chart.We briefly cut to Needy's chart, on some doctor's
          clipboard. We see her name: ANITA "NEEDY" LESNICKI and a
          few brief details about FIRST DEGREE MURDER and GRANDIOSE
          NOTIONS. Beneath that, we see a triple-highlighted
          warning in bright ink: KICKER.
          A NUTRITIONIST with a clipboard approaches Needy casually
          and eyes her breakfast plate.NUTRITIONISTJust one Toastem, huh?NEEDY(QUIETLY)I like Toastems.NUTRITIONISTThat's good. But I'm not sure a
                       Toastem can provide you with
                       sufficient energy for your day.
                       I'd recommend more complex
                       carbohydrates...(CONTINUED)4.CONTINUED:Needy scrambles to her feet and delivers a sudden,
          powerful ROUNDHOUSE KICK to the nutritionist's face.NEEDYI'D RECOMMEND THAT YOU SHUT THEFUCK UP!The nutritionist is KNOCKED OFF HER FEET-- as if she's
          been kicked by a far mightier creature than Needy-- and
          collapses, clutching her bleeding nose. We see that the
          bone has SNAPPED.
          The patients shriek. Chaos. As Needy is restrained by
          staff members, she thrashes like a trapped fish.
          Needy snorts up a killer LOOGIE and hocks it at the prone
          nutritionist. The glob nails her in the eye.It takes four STAFF MEMBERS to haul Needy away as she
          hollers in protest.The nutritionist curls up on the floor, cupping her
          bleeding nose as a ring of curious patients surrounds
          her. She spits out a TOOTH.INT. "THE HOLE" - SAMENeedy is tossed into seclusion. Her hair is wild and her
          face is wet with tears. The heavy door slams behind her,
          leaving only a shaft of light.NEEDY V.O.I wasn't always this cracked. I
                    used to be normal-- well, as
                    normal as any girl under the
                    influence of teenage hormones. But
                    after the killings began, I
                    started to feel, I don't know...
                    loose around the edges or
                    something. I was coming undone
                    like those jeans I made in Home
                    Ec. Falling to pieces like Patsy
                    Cline. Shredded like moo-shu pork.
                    Dead inside.
          Needy cringes as she briefly hallucinates abstract SHAPES
          in the darkness. Grinning skulls. Faces drained of life,
          half eaten. Grimaces of terror.
          Suddenly, soft music   is piped into "the hole," ostensibly
          to calm the patients   in solitary. Needy shudders and
          recoils at the sound   of it. It's a CHEESY ROCK BALLAD
          that we'll soon hear   again...(CONTINUED)5.CONTINUED:CHEESY SONG LYRICS"Through the trees, I will find
                    you. Heal the ruins left inside

                    you, we'll meet again..."NEEDY V.O.God, I hate this fucking song.Needy plugs her ears as if it physically hurts her to
          listen to the song. She curls up in the corner and steels
          herself for solitary confinement.DISSOLVE TO:TITLE: TWO MONTHS EARLIEREXT. DEVIL'S KETTLE, MN - NIGHT (TO ESTABLISH)Devil's Kettle is a quiet farming community, surrounded
          by dense woods and mirrored lakes. It's the kind of town
          that has one high school, one pizza joint, and one
          stoplight.On an overgrown rural route we see a rustic sign that
          reads "WELCOME TO DEVIL'S KETTLE- Pop. 7,036. Come See
          What's Cookin'!"NEEDYThis is where it all went down.
                    "Devil's Kettle" sounds twisted, I
                    know, but the place just is named
                    after a dumb waterfall.EXT. THE FALLS - NIGHT (TO ESTABLISH)We see the titular falls, surprisingly powerful, gushing
          over a rock face.NEEDY V.O.Well technically, it's two
                    waterfalls. One of them is normal--
                    it empties into a river basin. But
                    the other one goes into a hole.
                    And it doesn't come out. The
                    scientist guys can't explain it.
                    They've dropped all kinds of
                    things down there--bouncy balls,
                    red dye, radioactive slime-- but
                    nothing ever surfaces.(MORE)(CONTINUED)6.CONTINUED:NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)Maybe it's another dimension. Or,

          for a single FIRST FLOOR WINDOW-- Jennifer's-- still
          illuminated.
          There's a chicken coop and a wire livestock pen in the
          backyard. We're definitely in deep north country.NEEDY V.O.I've probably spent years of my
                    life in this house. Hundreds of
                    sleepovers, thousands of aimless
                    homework sessions, a million phone
                    calls. I've climbed through
                    Jennifer's window so many times.
                    But tonight, only one of us is
                    going to come out.INT. JENNIFER'S BEDROOM - SAMEJENNIFER CHECK lies on her bed, fidgeting as she watches
          TV. She's a girl of 16 with LONG, MATTED HAIR and a thin,
          frail body. Her features are gorgeous, but she looks sick
          and haggard. She picks at her skin with yellowed,
          Nosferatu-like fingernails and chews idly on a limp lock
          of hair.
          Jennifer wears a tight T-shirt that says KETTLE HIGH
          FLAGS and underwear.An `80s HORROR MOVIE flickers on the TV. Jennifer half-
          watches, distracted.NEEDY V.O.Jennifer didn't always look this
                    rough. Actually, she was the
                    prettiest girl in Devil's Kettle
                    when she wasn't so...hungry.Some recent photos on a corkboard reveal that Jennifer
          was indeed BEAUTIFUL AND CURVY.NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)She hadn't fed in weeks.Jennifer rolls over and glances at the window briefly.
          We see the OUTSIDE of the house again. It's dark and
          silent, but for the nearly inaudible snapping of twigs.(CONTINUED)7.CONTINUED:Jennifer turns her attention back to the TV.
          Suddenly, we see NEEDY'S FACE pop up against the window,
          white and startling. Before Jennifer notices, the face
          disappears.
          Outside the house, the bushes rustle. Needy is crouched
          below the window. We hear the pulsing of her HEART as if
          via ultrasound. It's a wet, rhythmic sound: Sploish,
          sploish, sploish.Inside, Jennifer stretches and shuts off the TV. She
          turns out the light. A beat of silence.
          Then, the sound of cracking near the window.JENNIFERHuh?
          Needy PLUNGES through the window, screaming and
          brandishing a HAMMER. She takes a SWING at Jennifer's
          head, but misses and BURIES IT IN THE WALL, specifically
          in Jennifer's Fall Out Boy poster.
          Needy throws herself on top of Jennifer. She STRADDLES
          Jennifer and grips her throat, throttling her.NEEDYYou'll throw me a bone, huh? Huh?
                    You killed Chip! You goddamned
                    monster! You...ZOMBITCH!Jennifer struggles to fight off Needy in the darkness.
          Her clawlike fingernails rake Needy's back and arms.Needy pulls a BOX CUTTER out of her waistband and flicks
          it open like a switchblade. Kshink!JENNIFER(GAGGING)Do you buy all your murder weapons

                    boxes.
          She takes a swipe at Jennifer's CROTCH. Jennifer
          instinctively CLUTCHES herself and rears up in defense.
          We see Jennifer's mouth come down on Needy's neck. Needy
          shrieks as if BITTEN, but continues to strangle Jennifer,
          straddling her and bearing down.(CONTINUED)8.CONTINUED: (2)Jennifer's T-shirt slides up to her armpits, exposing her
          breasts. For a moment, her eyes meet Needy's and she
          grins. It's as if she has control over Needy for a split
          second, sexual control...
          Needy recoils and SLASHES Jennifer's body left and right
          with the box-cutter, marking a gory, oozing "X" on her
          torso.NEEDY (CONT'D)(HYSTERICAL)CROSS OUT JENNIFER!Jennifer gasps, staring at her wounds in shock and
          disbelief. She looks back up at Needy. A beat of silence.
          Suddenly, THE GIRLS' BODIES LEVITATE RAPIDLY TOWARD THE
          CEILING. They wrestle in a bloody, screaming airborne
          heap, their figures entwined. Their bodies FALL,
          collapsing back onto the bed with a thud.Needy raises the box-cutter and plunges it into
          Jennifer's HEART. Blood GEYSERS from the wound.JENNIFER(CHOKING)My tit!
          Suddenly, the room is flooded with BRIGHT LIGHT,
          revealing a Needy straddling Jennifer's MUTLIATED BODY.
          Jennifer's breathing is a raspy death rattle.
          MRS. CHECK, a middle-aged woman in bad sleepwear and a
          worse perm rushes into the bedroom.MRS. CHECKJennifer! What is it, baby? Oh my
                    God! Oh my God!

          his Fender Jaguar from its gig bag. He notices her
          staring and runs the tip of his tongue over his lips.
          Needy swallows hard.JENNIFERHey, I think they need two

          wanting to continue the conversation with Nikolai alone.

          a challenging stare at the band. A DRUNK COUPLE begins
          two-stepping in front of the stage.

                    respect...Nikolai is already ignoring him.
          Needy, alarmed, emerges from her hiding place and
          discreetly rushes over to the bar where Jennifer is
          arguing with a jealous-looking Roman. He shakes his head
          in disgust and leaves the bar.
          Jennifer walks over holding an ostentatious PATRIOTIC
          THEMED DRINK. She laughs when she sees Needy's concerned
          expression.JENNIFERWhat? Are you scared of rock stars
                    too?NEEDYThose guys are rank, Jen. Just

                    backdoor-virgin anymore, thanks to
                    Roman. By the way, that hurts. I
                    couldn't even go to flags the next
                    day. I had to stay home and sit on
                    a bag of frozen peas.NEEDYOh my God.JENNIFERWell, if Nikolai wants innocent, I
                    can do innocent. I'll be Little

          Nikolai takes the mic and smiles broadly.NIKOLAIGood evening, Devil's Lake.
          Someone in the back shouts "Devil's Kettle!"NIKOLAI (CONT'D)Sorry. Anyway, we're Soft
                    Shoulder. And we just want to make
                    you happy.
          He WINKS at Jennifer.
          The band launch into the same intense, soaring song we
          heard in the COP CAR and the HOLE. Jennifer's eyes never
          leave Nikolai's. She's hypnotized, clinging to Needy's
          arm. Even the locals look charmed.
          Suddenly, a lick of FLAME appears on the wood paneling
          next to the stage. Needy is the first to notice. As she
          watches in horror, the fire is reflected in her glasses.(CONTINUED)26.CONTINUED: (7)The flames quickly climbs up to the ceiling and begin to
          blaze uncontrollably. People SCREAM and scatter. Someone
          ineffectually tries to throw a pitcher of beer on the
          fire.
          Nikolai turns and sees the fire spreading. He and Chas
          exchange glances. The BASS PLAYER pitches his guitar
          aside and jumps off the stage, and the drummer abandons
          his kit. Nikolai seems perfectly cool and composed as he
          watches from the stage...is he smiling?
          CHAOS. Everyone is trying to get out of the bar at once,
          causing a stampede. A woman's clothes and hair CATCH FIRE
          and she falls to her knees. We see a BEAM fall from the
          roof, nearly killing AHMET FROM INDIA.
          Jennifer stands still in a dreamlike state.NEEDY(to Jennifer)
                    I know where to go!
          Needy grabs Jennifer by the elbow and pulls her into the
          tiny BATHROOM. Choking on smoke, they climb onto the
          Sticker Toilet (which now sports a giant SOFT SHOULDER
          sticker on the tank) and boost each other out the
          BATHROOM WINDOW. Hundreds are still trapped inside,
          screaming.EXT. THE CAROUSEL- CONTINUOUSJennifer collapses in Needy's arms, coughing. Needy hugs
          her fiercely, almost romantically. She cups Jennifer's
          flushed face and looks into her eyes.JENNIFER(DAZED)It's so hot, Needy. I think I'm on
                    fire. Oh God, I'm burning!NEEDYYou're okay, I promise. You got

                    tin-foil bikini to the beach.
                    Everything's fine.
          Suddenly, a HAND clamps onto Jennifer's shoulder. Both
          girls jump. It's Nikolai, his forehead creased with false
          concern.NIKOLAIAre you girls all right?(CONTINUED)27.CONTINUED:Needy is less than thrilled to see him.NEEDYWe're great. Maybe you should try

          Jennifer covers her ears and cowers, sweat rolling down
          her face.NIKOLAI (CONT'D)God, it feels like hell out here.

          She slumps against Nikolai's chest.NIKOLAIYou're in shock. Here, drink this.
                    You'll feel better.
          He smoothly retrieves a plastic bottle of PEACH SCHNAPPS
          from his coat and holds it to Jennifer's lips. She swigs
          it cooperatively, dribbling down her chin.Needy blinks in disbelief at the coincidence.NEEDYAren't you a little freaked out

          She defiantly follows Nikolai toward the WHITE VAN, which
          is parked a suspiciously safe distance from the bar.
          Needy staggers after them slowly, watching.
          Behind Needy, the bar EXPLODES. Screams. Flames. Silence.
          Needy doesn't even look back as she watches Jennifer get
          into the van. Ash drifts into her hair like snowflakes.Nikolai takes off his shirt as he enters the van,

          pale and smiling. Her clothes are tattered and stained--
          her entire front is soaked in blood. Her makeup is
          smeared, and her eyes are bruised and sunken like a

          school portrait of Needy. Needy screams and watches in
          horror as it slides down the wall.
          The bile has hundred of tiny SPINES sticking out of it,
          like little porcupine needles, and it appears to move by
          itself, oozing across the linoleum, creeping into the
          corners. It's truly revolting.
          Needy grabs Jennifer blindly and claps a hand over her
          mouth.
          Jennifer falls to her knees, her screams turning to
          jagged, insane laughter.
          Needy tries to run, but Jennifer grabs her and THROWS her
          against the wall with superhuman force, pinning her.

          Needy's hair, her earlobe. Needy doesn't move a muscle.

          In the distance, a tiny figure slowly approaches, It

          popular clandestine meeting spot for the youth of Devil's
          Kettle. The abandoned sand volleyball pits are full of
          couples making out. Needy runs past them skittishly.
          As she ascends a grassy hill, CHIP is revealed,
          silhouetted against a backdrop of twirling police lights.
          Needy squints at the lights, sees CHIP's house in the
          distance.NEEDYWhy are the cops at your house?CHIPThey're not. They're at Jonas
                    Kozelle's house. He got murdered.NEEDYWhat?! Like, he was shot by

                    found teethmarks on him-- on the
                    body.
          His voice cracks. We see a brief, terrifying FLASH of
          Jonas's mutilated body and pain-stricken face.

                   there and talked to the cops.

                   just staring out the front window

          her. She closes her eyes.
          In the chaste space between CHIP and Needy's bodies, the
          volleyball-pit couple fuck like rabbits.DISSOLVE TO:A SERIES OF NEWSPAPER HEADLINESThe familiar Soft Shoulder ballad plays as we see a
          dreamy montage of headlines.
          The headline of the Devil's Kettle Sun-Post simply reads:"WHY?"The headline of the Minneapolis Star Tribune reads:
          "'BUTCHERED': Devil's Kettle youth brutally murdered in
          wake of devastating fire."A smaller headline on the front page of the New York
          Times reads: "Minnesota town rocked by grisly murder,

                    huge tragedy boner for Devil's

                    world of shit.
          We see Devil's Kettle citizens holding a tearful
          candlelight vigil by the former Carousel site. They
          softly sing along with the Soft Shoulder song.MOURNERS(SINGING)Through the trees, I will find

          Another Star Tribune headline. This one reads: "Two weeks
          later, cannibal killer still at large." A smaller subhead
          reads "ARTS: Local band Soft Shoulder sign to major."NEEDY V.O.The days marched on as usual, but

          path runs through the stately old monuments into a small
          valley where a funeral is taking place.(CONTINUED)79.CONTINUED:Faint moaning and sobbing can be heard. Then, a
          procession of 6 or 7 GOTH/EMO KIDS appears on the crest
          of the hill. They move forward into the cemetery,
          flamboyantly dressed in black capes, chains, cloaks, neon
          hairpieces, fishnets, mesh, 18-hole combat boots, etc.

          At the bottom of the hill, Colin Gray's very conservative-
          looking family stands next to the fresh grave, surrounded
          by sympathetic mourners. NEEDY stands near the back,
          looking shell-shocked. There are also a few press
          photographers snapping photos, and of course, a Catholic
          priest.PRIESTWe gather here today to celebrate
                    the life of Colin Gray, who was

          ranting yet.MRS. GRAYBy the time they found Colin in
                    that godforsaken house, he looked

          to Chip, who is barely alive. She stares in horror at his
          torn arm and exposed ribs, then falls to her knees over
          his body.NEEDYOh, Chip!CHIPNeedy. You saved me.NEEDYI'm gonna call for help.She reaches into Chip's pocket and pulls out his beat-up
          cell phone. She wipes off the prickly ooze with her hand.CHIPOh no, I'm out of minutes!NEEDYI think 911 is always a free call.CHIPOh yeah. You're right.Needy dials to no avail. The phone is hopelessly clogged

                    gonna die. I think I already died

          Chip's eyes close. His face relaxes. He's gone.
          Needy wails at the top of her lungs. She rests her head

          is bloody, her hair is full of blood and guts, and her
          BROKEN ARM looks gruesome.
          In the background, yet another oblivious COUPLE are
          making out.Needy stops to stare at them, her gaze calm but obviously
          insane. They break apart and stare back at her.GIRLWhat are you looking at, Clumpy?NEEDY(QUIETLY)Just watching your old man try to

          People ignore her as she slowly walks toward the stage.
          They're too busy slow dancing and laughing in their

          A small creek emptying into a stream   runs parallel to the
          road. Needy seems something glinting   at the mouth of the
          creek and stoops to pick it up. It's   Nikolai's BOWIE
          KNIFE, the one he threw into Devil's   Kettle, never to be
          seen again.
          Needy picks it up and tucks it into her waistband.
          A STATION WAGON comes rattling up the road. Needy sticks
          her thumb out again.
          The wagon pulls over to the side of the road. The driver,
          a grizzled older man, rolls down the window. He eyes

          distance, we see a road sign that reads, ironically, SOFTSHOULDER.We hear the song on the radio end, segueing into the DJ's
          bumper.RADIO DJWhat a song. Thought we'd play
