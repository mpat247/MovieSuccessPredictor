           housing crisis in the middle of the
           biggest boom anybody'd ever seen. Why?ROBERT (O.S.)I'm a child of the 50's. My father

           But this is something we've seen
           over and over again, time and time
           again, that competition for this--
           limited amount of dollars out
           there, can make even the best of us
           manic. So it's not surprising that
           we see these asset bubbles, but
           when reality sets in of course,

          scribbling his own red-ink across a stack of CONTRACT

          flair. It actually works.
                         
          A SERVANT takes Robert's briefcase from him as he enters,
          handing him three small PRESENTS which he puts under his arm.
                         
          We HEAR sounds of a DINNER PARTY complete with CHILDREN
          laughing. Hold on Robert's face- some mixture of excitement
          and anticipation.INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUSA party in progress, dinner already served.

          Robert hands out the presents, and the kids unwrap them in a
          frenzy. He continues making the rounds until he finally gets to
          Brooke and Peter, seated next to each other.
                         
          They embrace, but we notice clear restraint, a marked contrast
          to his behavior towards their kids.BROOKEIt's your birthday, Dad, not theirs.
           You're spoiling them rotten.ROBERT(GRINNING)It's my job! It's my job. You guys

           said-- old age... is clearly a case

           genes, but you've got mine, too!
                         
          More LAUGHTER. Robert laughs, too. He sees Ellen hug Peter
          across the room.ROBERT (CONT'D)Now, I'm aware that may seem
           uncharacteristic, but maybe it's taken me
           sixty years to realize what's truly

          Robert brings the drinks to the banquette where Brooke rests
          with an open FOLDER. He resumes signing papers.BROOKE(LAUGHS)It's all about you, isn't it.(POINTS)Four... and nineteen.ROBERTYeah, yeah yeah...

           we lost the Firestone bid.ROBERT(LAUGHS)Yeah, well... I just... wanted it
           to be about the family tonight.

           I am 60. That's a big difference in
           point of view.BROOKEDad, you're not that old.ROBERT(LAUGHS)It catches up alright. And maybe
           there's some other things I'd like to

          exquisite space. It's the modern mirror of Robert's mansion,

          modern woman: sleek, fit, and flowing, even at home.
                         
          She's intently focused, handwriting personal notes onto a stack
          of INVITATIONS for the "Julie C�te Gallery - Paintings by Victor
          Rodriguez - April 10th" as she downs the last of a WHITE WINE.

          After a second, the door BUZZES open.INT. JULIE'S LOFT - SAMERobert enters. Julie is already back at the table, writing.
          She's arranging 4 POLAROIDS of different paintings on a wall,
          along with a SEATING CHART. He walks down the long hall.

          She crosses to the open kitchen and pours out more wine,
          lights a cigarette. Robert trails.ROBERTAlright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm
           late. I'm always late-- you know
           that-- and I'm sorry. And I'm

          The tension breaks, and they LAUGH. He grabs her and they

          him backwards into the bedroom and they begin to make love.INT. GREENBERG & COMPANY - OFFICE HALL - THE NEXT DAYRobert enters the palatial quarters, decorated with ornate
          18th century furniture. As we'll see soon, it's a stark

          came to see me one day last year.

          opportunity- there's a copper mine,
          it's in Russia, it's under-
          exploited- there's billions under
          the ground, and to get it out, all
          we need is a couple hundred
          million, you put in a hundred,
          we'll put in a hundred- we'll
          triple it all in six months." So, I
          go check it out. And the geological
          survey's right, friendly
          government. And to lock it in, you
          hedge it, right? Sell the copper
          ahead on the commodities exchange
          and it all works, it's fine, and
          you're making a fortune.
