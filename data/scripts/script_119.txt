    lined residential street. Note the small apartment complex
    set back from the curb.CAPTION: HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIAOur narrator is HENRY OBERT (O-BURT)(30).HENRY (V.O.)This is where where F. Scott
               Fitzgerald died on December 21, 1940.

    INSERT ARCHIVAL PHOTOS of Fitzgerald.   His work.   His life.HENRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)Fitzgerald was one of the truly great
               American writers of the 20th century.
               Tender is the Night. The Last Tycoon.
               This Side of Paradise. And, of course,
               my favorite, The Great Gatsby. But
               Fitzgerald ended up out here. Writing
               movies that never got made. Drinking
               too much. Alienating people. Losing
               his way.2   EXT.   FITZGERALD/GRAHAM APARTMENT -- SIDEWALK - DAYHenry stands on the sidewalk. Full of promise and hope.
    Wears a pizza delivery outfit as he stares at the apartment,
    more with reverence than curiosity.CAPTION: HENRY OBERTHENRY (V.O.)I stop by here sometimes--out of
               respect. Fitzgerald had this amazing
               gift.3   EXT. FITZGERALD/GRAHAM APARTMENT -- SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUSHenry crosses the street--heading for his parked Honda.     He
    unlocks the car. Swings open the back door.HENRY (V.O.)But he wasted it. He wasted his
               talent.

    Henry yanks a MAGNETIC SIGN out of the back seat and slaps
    it on the outside of the driver's door: PIZZA STARZ. One
    last glance at the fabled apartment complex.2.HENRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)When I sell my novel, I won't make
              his mistakes.4   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM - DAYThe man (40's) and woman (30's) sit on the couch in their
    tastefully-decorated San Fernando Valley home. Expensive
    taste in clothes. Her cleavage a bit too obvious. Both
    seem a little uncomfortable. Uncertain.CAPTION: DR. ALAN & COLETTE MOONEYThey look off to the side, speaking to someone off-camera.ALANWe thought this was going to be a
              reality series.COLETTEYou know, like the Kardashians.

    They listen.    Here comes the bad news.ALANOh. Really? A documentary? This
              is going to be a documentary about
              our writing group?COLETTEThe whole group. Not just us, right?
              Not that it should be just about
              us...

    Nervous laugh.ALANNo.

    They look at each other: A documentary? They try to mask
    their disappointment.COLETTESo this is going to be like--like
              what I saw the other night on cable?
              About bees mating.ALANOr that, um, that one about the
              Holocaust.

    Colette nods, remembering.ALAN (CONT'D)Pretty...Pretty--3.COLETTE--Powerful.ALANPowerful.   Yes. Powerful.COLETTEWe love documentaries.ALANWe do.

    They look at each other again: What have we gotten into?COLETTE (V.O.)Natasha, the Russian peasant, dressed
              oh-so-slowly...5   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM - EVENINGA POSTER BOARD SIGN--someone went to Kinko's--is posted

              absolutely, by endless thoughts of

    They sit around the dining room table. Colette, convinced
    she's the next Amy Tan, reads aloud from her TYPED PAGES.
    The others all have copies in front of them. We recognize
    Henry, the frog waiting to become a prince, making copious
    notes and Alan, oh-so-proud, hanging on every word. Beaming.

    Three others round out the group:

    Younger MAN (early 30s). Unshaven. Always thinks he's the
    coolest guy in any room. Can't avoid glances at the camera.CAPTION: WILLIAM BRUCEThe OLDEST MEMBER of the group (over 60) sits with his arms
    folded as he listens, shifting in his chair. Captain Grumpy.CAPTION: JOHN K. BUTZINFinally, the young (mid-to-late 20s), angelic, WOMAN listening
    intently, the one who probably stopped to rescue a cat on
    her way here.CAPTION: HANNAH RINALDI4.COLETTE (CONT'D)...Any second that she might explode,
              her chastity spraying across the
              ceiling...Spraying across the ceiling
              like passionate graffiti. Natasha
              never thought such a moment possible.
              "Have I satisfied you, Natasha?"
              Yuri had inquired after their fourth
              round of vodka-soaked lovemaking.
              "Nyet, Not yet," Natasha stated,
              exhausted, but grateful.

    Awkward silence around the table as Colette removes her
    reading glasses and waits. Alan clears his throat, looking
    cheerful.ALANWell?   Comments?6   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                       6Henry's sparse studio apartment. Minimal furniture. His laptop
    is set up on an old door, stretched across some blue plastic
    crates.

    There are BOOKS piled everywhere. All sorts of books. And
    PAPER -- pieces of paper, including letters and cards and
    printed emails, dozens of them, are taped throughout the
    small apartment.

    We are introduced to Henry the writer: pondering over his
    battered laptop, pacing up and down the floor, checking his
    nearly empty refrigerator, stretched out on his Goodwill
    couch, watching TV.

    Finally, inspiration. Henry rushes to his desk and taps out
    a sentence or two on his computer, feeling proud for his
    accomplishment.HENRY (V.O.)I graduated from the University of
              Illinois. English major. Taught
              high school for a couple years, but
              hated it. Moved out here to be a
              writer.7   EXT. HOUSE - DAY/NIGHT                                             7As Henry's voice over continues, we see him in uniform with
    pizza in hand at the front door of a house. Rings doorbell.HENRY (V.O.)I work two jobs. Delivering pizzas
              and cleaning carpets. Good jobs for
              a writer.5.8    INT. HOUSE - DAY/NIGHT                                             8Henry cleaning the carpets as the heavily-tattooed MOTORCYCLE
     DUDE points to a dirty spot: Over here.HENRY (V.O.)You meet lots of interesting people.9    INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                       9Henry points to the letters on the wall. C.U. picks up on
     phrases like "We regret to inform you," or "Sorry, but this
     story isn't right for us," or "The Baxter Agency currently
     isn't accepting new clients."HENRY (V.O.)I have two unpublished novels.
               Working on my third, Pizza to Go.
               These are my rejection letters.
               Rejected by agents. Rejected by
               publishers. When you think about
               it, it's pretty amazing how many
               ways people can reject you.10   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM - NIGHT               10Henry, John, Alan, Colette, Hannah, and William sit around
     the table. Impressive buffet of cold cuts, cheeses, and
     shrimp has been set out.HENRY (V.O.)Our writing group meets every Tuesday
               night. Mostly at Alan and Colette's.
               Sometimes we rotate.

     John helps himself to some shrimp.   Then helps himself to
     some more.HENRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)I love coming to the group. Everyone
               always has such constructive feedback.
               It's like we're all in this together.HANNAHI really like the way Yuri is
               developing, Colette.COLETTEYou do?JOHNWell, if you ask John K. Butzin...

     Can't help looking at the camera. Making sure it's on him.6.JOHN (CONT'D)You're still going to have to explain
          why this Natasha dame goes AWOL on
          her husband. Still kinda iffy to
          me.

Another glance at the camera: Did you get that?ALANI was bothered by that, too. Why
          would Natasha betray a reliable,
          dependable husband for a washed-up
          young punk?

All eyes on Colette.    She shifts in her chair.   Uncomfortable.COLETTEOh.   Well...um...um...

An uneasy silence. Colette is blocked--nowhere to go
creatively. Her face tightens up. Bites her lip.COLETTE (CONT'D)Oh God. I've been rewriting and
          rewriting and rewriting and--ALANPoodles.     It's OK.COLETTENo. It's not OK. I still can't
          explain Natasha's motive. What's
          the use? I'm not a writer.

William to the rescue.WILLIAMWhoa. Whoa. Time out. The dude's
          good in bed. Trust me, that's all
          the motive she needs.JOHNRoger that. Torpedo Chapter Three.
          Blow it up. Get the focus back on
          this broad--Natasha.HENRY--Yes. I was thinking the same thing.HANNAHMake it clear that Natasha wants to
          be closer...

Colette makes notes furiously, nodding in agreement.7.HENRY (V.O.)Writing can be such a solitary
                existence, so it's good to have this
                outlet where you can meet other
                writers and exchange ideas. Here it
                really is all for one and one for
                all.11   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM - NIGHT               11Later that evening.    Meeting is over.

     Alan, Colette, Hannah, Henry, William, and John are all
     standing up now. William stretches. John reaches for more
     shrimp. Friendly banter. Laughter.COLETTEWho wants coffee?

     Everybody does.    William taps Henry on the shoulder.WILLIAMLend me ten bucks? I'm having cash
                flow issues.HENRYSure.WILLIAMThanks, bro'. You're the best.12   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                       12Henry sits at his desk, staring at the blank computer. Lost
     in thought. Emphasis on lost.HENRY (V.O.)This new novel Pizza to Go is about
                Scott, a pizza delivery guy in LA.
                He comes across some interesting
                characters. I like what I have so
                far, but it's only a hundred pages
                and I'm stuck...13   INT.   HENRY'S APARTMENT - LATER - DAY                             13Henry stands in front of the mirror in his apartment, wearing
     the Pizza Starz hat and shirt. Ready for work.HENRY (V.O.)...Haven't written a word in the
                last two weeks. Not one. Hannah
                teases me about having writer's block.8.14   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM - NIGHT               14FLASHBACK to the last group meeting. Focus on Hannah. Her
     smile. Her warmth. She listens and comments. Actively
     engaged in the conversation.HENRY (V.O.)...I keep thinking about her. She's
               all I think about. Really would
               like to ask her out.15   INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT - DAY                                      15Hannah reaches for a pair of READING GLASSES and slips them
     on. Talks to someone O.S.HANNAHWhat do you think? On or off? Do
               they make me look smarter? I need a
               new pair.

     She takes the glasses off. Puts them back on. Off again.
     Debating. Hannah prepares herself with a series of quick
     breaths and waves her hands in the air. Then she stares
     directly into the camera.HANNAH (CONT'D)Hi. I'm originally from Prescott,
               Arizona. Followed my mom out here
               about four years ago. That's her
               back there.

     Camera picks up a wisp of a WOMAN (over 50)in the background,
     waving, with an equally pleasant smile.CAPTION: MAUREEN RINALDIHANNAH (CONT'D)My parents are divorced. Not her
               fault.16   INT. RESTAURANT #1 - DAY                                           16William favors jeans and faded tweed jacket. Sits in the
     corner of a Valley restaurant, nursing a cup of coffee and
     talks to the camera.WILLIAMWhat do you want to know about me?
               I'm 27. Single. A virgin.

     He flashes that wicked, seductive smile.9.WILLIAM (CONT'D)Just kidding. I'm actually 28.

               sprawling junk heap of a town without
               a soul. Why did I come to LA? Um,
               because I knew you were here and
               that you'd loan me a hundred bucks
               if I needed it. Right?

     WAITRESS #1 refills his coffee cup. Her reward is that smile.WILLIAM (CONT'D)Thanks, babe.

     She walks away.   William admires the view.WILLIAM (CONT'D)I already got her number. Maybe I'll
               text her. Maybe I won't.

     Eyes back towards the camera.WILLIAM (CONT'D)So 'bout that hundred bucks? What
               d'ya think?

     A hint of desperation in his voice.WILLIAM (CONT'D)OK. What about fifty? C'mon, bro'.

               about writing comes down to two simple
               words: Tom Clancy. Yes, sir. Tom
               Clancy. The man's a genius. Does
               his research. All those nitty-gritty

               John K. Butzin has one agent very
               interested in Roaring Lion. And a

               about John Grisham? Look at all
               that money he's made! Just teasing,
               John. We know you deserved every
               dime, but, hey, John, could you spread
               it around a bit, pal?COLETTEAlan likes to tease.

     She gives her husband an affectionate squeeze.ALANColette, here, is the real writer.
               I'm more of an idea guy. I come up
               with great ideas, but don't always
               follow through. I'll show you.

     He picks up his mini-digital Olympus RECORDER off the coffee
     table. Thinks for a second.ALAN (CONT'D)(To recorder)
               Idea for romantic novel.

     Alan catches himself.ALAN (CONT'D)No. Make that, idea for romantic
               ebook.

     He winks at the camera--showing he's hip to the jargon.ALAN (CONT'D)Possible movie option, too: Frovers.
               They couldn't be friends. They
               couldn't be lovers. So they became
               Frovers.

     Satisfied, Alan turns off the recorder.22   EXT. COLETTE'S GARDEN - DAY                                       22Colette opens the sliding glass door and steps out into a
     beautiful garden area. Quiet and private. Camera follows
     her over to a solitary BENCH.13.COLETTEThis is where I come for inspiration.
                I believe a writer must have quiet
                and solitude. I'll meditate. Write
                in my journal. Set out my creative
                path for the day. This is my Walden
                Pond.

     Colette sits down on the bench. Takes in the environment.COLETTE (CONT'D)Favorite author? I'd have to say
                Joan Didion. Her writing sends

     that it is a novel by Joyce Carol Oates. Colette appears to
     be getting into the story just a bit too much.24   EXT.   COLETTE'S GARDEN - DAY                                     24POOL GUY and GARDENER hear Colette's sensual cries drifting

     from a corner of the bench. Holds it up for camera.COLETTEOh, this? I keep Oprah out here for
                luck. She's done so much to help
                writers. I know I'm going to be on
                her television show one day. I just
                know it.

     Colette can already see the moment in her mind. Short beat.
     Then she looks off-camera--listening to someone.COLETTE (CONT'D)What? Oprah doesn't have a TV show
                anymore? Really? Since when?

     Short beat as she hears the answer.COLETTE (CONT'D)Oh...

     Short beat as she tries to cover.14.COLETTE (CONT'D)I knew that. I did. I-I knew.26   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                       26Henry stands in front of his mirror. Checks his appearance.

               ask Hannah out.

     Henry becomes lost in thought.   Regroups.HENRY (CONT'D)It's time. I like her. She likes me--
               I think. I've got to take action.
               Still stuck on Page 100. So I'm
               asking Hannah out on a date tonight.
               It'll be great. And I'll put this
               writer's block behind me.

     camera.ALANI'm the group leader. After all,
               getting together was my idea. They're
               all my patients. That's how we met.
               First one published gets a free eye
               exam.

     Alan cackles a bit too hard at that joke.    He listens to a
     question being asked.ALAN (CONT'D)Why did I form the group? To help
               Colette. Oh, I certainly enjoy the
               creative process, but Colette?
               Writing is her dream. I'd do anything
               for her because...because she's my
               dream. So there you have it.

     Alan reaches for his tape recorder.ALAN (CONT'D)Possible names for future characters.(MORE)15.ALAN (CONT'D)Anthony Gilmore. No, wait. Make
               that Anthony T. Gilmore. Much

     Satisfied, Alan turns off the recorder.28   INT. RESTAURANT #1 - NIGHT                                        28Place is empty. Alan, Colette, William, John, and Henry
     gather around the center table.

     The WRITERS AT WORK poster is propped up against a nearby
     empty chair. Hard not to notice the EMPTY CHAIR at the table.
     Hannah is missing.

     Waitress #1 pours coffee all around. Henry fidgets in his
     chair, focused on the empty chair.JOHN(To William)
               How come we never chow down at your
               place?WILLIAMThis is my place. Close to the working

     John rolls his eyes.HENRYWhere's Hannah? Anyone know?

     Nobody responds. Alan checks his watch.ALANTime to get started.HENRYShouldn't we wait for Hannah?WILLIAMLet's go, people. I'm ready to read.ALANWilliam's right. We'll start. She'll
               show up.

     William starts passing out pages. Henry eyes the empty chair.
     Colette looks over William's pages. There are only three.
     She has a puzzled look.16.COLETTEWilliam, aren't these the same pages
               you read last time?WILLIAMNope, they're different.JOHNThey look the same.WILLIAMThey're different. I changed a word.HENRYOne word?COLETTEThat's it?WILLIAMWriting is rewriting, Colette.

               One goddamn word.

     Henry continues staring at the empty chair.29   INT. RESTAURANT #1 - NIGHT                                      29The evening meeting is winding to an end. John stands up to
     stretch. Alan slides papers into his leather satchel.

     HANNAH'S CHAIR remains empty. Henry remains concerned.17.HENRYI wonder what happened to Hannah.ALANIt's not like her to miss.

The mystery is quickly solved. Front door opens. In rushes
Hannah, dashing directly towards the others, looking harried.HANNAHI'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for missing
          the meeting.JOHNWhat happened? Your car break down?ALANYou oversleep?COLETTEMaureen. Is Maureen OK?WILLIAMPeople. C'mon. Look at her. That
          glow. Hannah met a guy. She got
          laid.

Hannah gives William a playful smack on the back.HANNAHAs a matter of fact, I did meet a
          guy.WILLIAMTold ya.HANNAHHis name's Brian.

Check out Henry. He looks absolutely horrified. No!

Hannah takes a deep breath and flashes a smile the size of
the Grand Canyon.HANNAH (CONT'D)He's my new agent!

She remembers the camera.HANNAH (CONT'D)(Directly to camera)
          An agent. I've got an agent!

Surprise and silence. The writers look at each other and
then back at Hannah. Not quite sure how to react.18.Stunned as Hannah turns her attention back to the group.HANNAH (CONT'D)That writing class I took? Well,
                for the final project, I turned in
                the first chapter of Sleeping on the
                Moon. I guess the teacher liked it.
                Then he gave it to his friend who's
                an agent. Brian. He called. Had to
                see me right away. Brian wants to
                sign me.WILLIAMBet Brian wants more than that.

     Playful smack from Colette to William on the shoulder: Behave.COLETTEThat's so great, Hannah.JOHNI salute you, young lady.

     And he does.ALANYes.   Fantastic. Fanntasstic.

     Henry takes it all in quietly, unable to speak.

     Alan bounces up and gives Hannah a big hug as the others
     immediately start peppering her with questions.30   INT.   RESTAURANT #1 - NIGHT                                      30Colette, Alan, John, William and Henry encircle a beaming

     plastic cups, as Colette passes them around to Hannah, Henry,
     John, and William.ALAN(Raising cup)

     Everyone clinks their cups together.HANNAHThank you. But I just want to remind
                everyone that we're all in this
                together. I couldn't have come this
                far without the group.19.ALAN(Smiling)
               All for one . . . .

     But our camera picks up on the individual writers and
     something is amiss. Everything seems a beat off. People
     appear happy, but a little subdued. The joy seems a bit too
     forced.HANNAHI'm merely the first one to get
               signed. But we're all going to have
               an agent soon.JOHNWell, as a matter of fact, there's
               an agent in Santa Monica very
               interested in John K. Butzin. He's
               reading the manuscript as we speak.

     The others let John's remark pass without comment.   William
     taps Henry on the shoulder.WILLIAM(Lower voice)
               Hey, can you lend me ten bucks?

     Henry is still a bit dazed by this unexpected turn of events.HENRYSure.WILLIAMThanks, bro'. You're the best.

     group members tumble out into the evening. Alan carries his
     WRITERS AT WORK sign.

     William makes a move towards Hannah, but the the ever-
     protective Henry grabs her gently by her elbow, cutting
     William off. They start walking in one direction. William
     and John head out in the other. Meanwhile, Alan and Colette
     wave enthusiastically to Hannah.ALANCongratulations again, Hannah!COLETTEYes, yes.   Way to go, Hannah!20.HANNAH(Calling back)

     door of her clunker-of-a-Ford as Henry waits.HENRYI'm so proud of you, Hannah.HANNAHYour turn will come, Henry. You're a
               better writer than I am. So much
               better. You went to college.

     Hannah looks directly into the camera, pointing to Henry.HANNAH (CONT'D)He's a great writer. Henry Obert. I
               knew him when.

     Henry, clearly embarrassed, puts his hand up to block the
     camera. Tries to change the subject.HENRYListen. Maybe some afternoon we
               could go for a drive. There are

               My lucky number. I should have known
               this was going to happen.HENRYThere is no one more deserving.

     Hannah rewards Henry's praise with a peck on the lips.    And
     a warm hug.

     Hannah steps in her car, starts it up and rolls down the
     window.HANNAHI'm going to dedicate my novel to
               you.

     A final wave and Henry watches as she disappears into the
     night. He sighs.34   INT. MONTAGE OF SHOTS - DAY                                        34A series of shots featuring the writers writing--or, at least,
     trying: Alan pauses between eye appointments to record an
     idea.

     William continues scribbling at the restaurant, this time
     eyeing WAITRESS #2.

     Hannah, sitting cross-legged on her bed, types away on her
     laptop computer.

     Colette sits on her private bench, seeking inspiration.

     John sits at his keyboard. Vintage black-and-white war movie
     plays on the TV. John appears more interested in the movie.

     surrenders yet again and flips off the computer.35   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                       35Henry, sitting in his studio apartment, wears his pizza

     Takes a break and talks to the camera.COLETTEMy novel is called Nyet, Not Yet.
               It's about a Russian woman who comes
               to this country in search of love.
               It was inspired by a story I heard
               from one of my massage clients, Yuri.
               Yes, it's true--I used to do massage.
               In fact, that's how I met Alan, though
               I certainly didn't give him the kind
               of massage he really wanted. At least
               not the first time.

     Colette allows herself a slight smile at the memory.COLETTE (CONT'D)I will get an agent. It comes down
               to this: if Hannah can get an agent,

          yet? No. Not yet. There are so
          many, you know?

The deep breaths and waving of hands begin again. Here comes
that smile as she looks directly into the camera.HANNAH (CONT'D)So. I am somewhat superstitious.
          Yes. Guilty. I'm drawn to the number
          4. I was born at exactly 4:04 p.m.
          on April 4th. 4-4-4-4. That wasn't
          an accident. No way.

She's dead serious.HANNAH (CONT'D)Certain things I've learned to avoid.

          And the number 13 especially. I hate
          the number 13. Hate it.

Conversation interrupted by RINGING DOORBELL. Hannah frowns
at the interruption as Maureen scurries to the door and opens
it, revealing Colette hiding behind a HUGE GIFT BASKET. She
breezes in. Takes over. Over the top.COLETTEHi...Hi...Hello everyone. I was
          just in the neighborhood and--

Colette freezes when she notices the camera.COLETTE (CONT'D)Oh, Hannah. I'm so sorry. I didn't
          know they'd be here--

Yeah, right. Hannah springs up. Follows Colette as she sets
the basket down for all to admire.HANNAHColette.    What a lovely surprise!

Hugs all around between Hannah and Maureen and Colette.
Hannah looks blown away by the gift basket.HANNAH (CONT'D)My, what's this?COLETTEOh. It's nothing. I just had to
          say "Congratulations" to my new

     Hannah gives Henry's hand a playful squeeze: Thank you.
     Alan and Hannah sit down opposite from each other. Henry
     pulls up a chair to the side. Alan selects a pair. Puts them
     on Hannah.26.ALANHow about...

Hannah shrugs her blase reaction.HANNAHMmmmmmm.

Alan removes the brown-colored frames.   Studies them for a
second. Then -- inspiration arrives.ALANExcuse me.   One sec.

He reaches inside his coat pocket for his RECORDER. Speaks
into it.ALAN (CONT'D)Ah. Name for character. Alexander
          Brown. Wears brown-colored glasses.HANNAHOf course he would.

Henry nods, agreeing. Satisfied, Alan puts the recorder
away and reaches for another pair of glasses.ALANYou know this great idea for a novel
          hit me this morning. It's called
          Unleashed.

Alan tries the second pair on Hannah. She checks herself in
the mirror. Then she shows Henry. They both shake their head:
No. It is a funny moment between friends. They laugh as Alan
reaches for pair #3.ALAN (CONT'D)It's about a dog who becomes human

herself in the mirror, finally liking what she sees. She
looks over towards Henry.HANNAH (CONT'D)What do you think?

Poor Henry. She does look good. He's falling even harder for
her by the moment.27.HENRYYou look great, Hannah.

     Hannah can't decide. She studies herself in the mirror as
     Henry studies her. Henry reaches for his ANDROID and snaps
     a photo of her. Alan brings them back to real time.ALANQuestion: You think your agent might

A loud KNOCK on the examination room door. David is saved by
the bell.ALAN (CONT'D)My, I wonder who that could be.

He walks over to the door, opens it and feigns surprise to
see Colette. She moves right in.COLETTEHi, honey.   So sorry to intrude.ALANColette? Gee, this is an incredible

     Colette thinks for a second.COLETTEAs a matter of fact, I think I do. I
               think I do.

     Colette searches her large PURSE and produces a manila folder.ALANSay, how about that?

          the American Dream and . . .

Henry stops. Rethinks his explanation.HENRY (CONT'D)Actually, it's quite simple. Boy

Henry nods with his heart.HANNAH (CONT'D)So how does it end? Does boy get the
          girl?

Long beat. Then Henry reaches into the back seat of his car
for his KNAPSACK. Puts it on his lap, unzips it. Pulls out
his personal copy of Gatsby.48.HENRYHere. Take my copy.

     conversation.HANNAHHow much?

     More hushed tones from William. Hannah shakes her head.HANNAH (CONT'D)But if I loaned you money, then I

Alan's voice trails off before he can dig himself any deeper.
More silence as Hannah wrestles with this unexpected reaction.
Finally looks to Henry for help.HANNAHWhat do you think, Henry?

All eyes on Henry. He hesitates.   Then --HENRYYes. Actually, it is really good,

     latest success:

     Alan and Colette sit on their living room couch together,
     wearing matching pajamas, staring straight ahead like zombies.
     His tape recorder sits on the coffee table. Alan reaches
     for it. She grabs it from his hand and throws it.

     William sits at the counter of Restaurant #2, drumming his
     fingers on the legal pad, half-heartedly trying to write.
     WAITRESS #3 pours him some more coffee, trying to make eye
     contact with him. William ignores her.

     John sits in front of his computer screen, but he can't
     concentrate. Gives up. Shuts down computer. Flips on TV.
     Another war movie.

     Henry stares absent-mindedly at his wall of rejection letters.

     Hannah sits at her computer--the only one actually working
     at the moment--but she stops long enough to take a deep,
     deep sigh. A lot weighs on her mind.70   EXT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DRIVEWAY - DAY                    70Alan arrives home. Steps out of his Lexus. Whistling. Happy-

     unbuttoned. Smoking. He freezes mid-puff.ALANWilliam?58.WILLIAMHey.   Alan.

     SOUND OF SHOWER AND COLETTE SINGING OFF-KEY echoes throughout
     the house. Alan turns quiet as he makes the connection.WILLIAM (CONT'D)Just, um. Just stopped by to...read
                some pages for Colette. Yeah.

     There are no pages on the coffee table in front of William.72   EXT. COLETTE'S GARDEN - MOMENTS LATER                            72Alan steps outside. Somber. Focused. Acts like the
     Terminator in his scanning of the area. Man on a mission.
     What is he looking for? He finds it almost immediately,
     zeroing in on Colette's bench. Alan marches over and grabs
     Colette's prized framed photo of Oprah. Clutching it in his
     hand, Alan looks at Oprah's smiling face, then back towards
     the house. Then he takes the frame and smashes it down on
     the ground as hard as he can. Next he jumps up and down on
     the smashed frame multiple times. Not satisfied, Alan bends
     down, picks up the photo and rips it to shreds with his hands.
     There. That felt good.

     Pool Guy and Gardener have witnessed the whole scene.    What
     the hell? They exchange puzzled looks.73   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                     73Henry talks to the camera.HENRYHannah's avoiding me. She doesn't

     letters. Colette sits cross-legged, devoting her full energy
     to chanting and beating her hands on a small DRUM.

     and nodding at people, not being too forceful.

     Sigrid, wearing her little red work vest and glasses, stands
     off to the side, beaming with pride. She hurries over to a

Alan grabs the book and gives it back to Henry, nudging him
again.ALANWe need to move, Henry.

Alan and Colette slide their book over to Richard.COLETTEHi there.

Richard looks up at her for a split second and decides to
ignore her. Another scribbled signature as he remains on
the phone.

Colette takes the book, trying not to look hurt. Alan grabs
Henry and they leave the area. Hannah is next up. She puts
her book down on the table.RICHARD(On phone)
          Damn it! That simply won't--

Richard glances up. Sees Hannah standing there. He stops in
mid-sentence. Smiles.RICHARD (CONT'D)Hi.HANNAHHello.

Richard hangs up the phone.

The two start chatting. Camera goes over to the shell-shocked
Henry, still clutching his book, watching as Hannah and
Richard carry on. Henry is so disconcerted by what he sees
that he fails to notice Eudora, still with purple hair and
matching glasses, the very next person in line behind Hannah,
waving at him.70.89   EXT. BOOKSTORE - DAY                                            89Outside bookstore. After the signing. Alan and Colette walk

               books in a week than I ever have.
               Why would he bother call--

     Just then, Hannah's iPhone goes off. She answers. The other
     three stop in their tracks.HANNAH (CONT'D)(On telephone)
               Hello? Who? Richard? Oh. Richard.
               Hi.71.COLETTEUnbelievable.

Henry inches closer to Hannah, forcing Hannah to move back,
creating an uneasy dance between the two. She turns her
back on Henry.HANNAH(On telephone)
          Coffee? Oh, God. I don't know,
          Richard. I really appreciate the
          invitation, but--

She listens. Her face is anguished. Finally --HANNAH (CONT'D)This isn't a good time. Call me later.
          Yes. I'll think about it. Yes. Bye.

Hannah turns off her phone. Alan, Colette, Henry stand there,
gaping jaws wide open.ALANAmazing.COLETTEThis isn't fair. This just isn't
          fair.HANNAHWhat?COLETTEFirst, you get an agent. Then you

          Benedict wants to have coffee with
          you? All this is happening to you.
          And only you. Isn't there anything --
          I don't know--some kind of cosmic
          creative crumb for the rest of us to
          nibble on?HANNAHI don't like what you're suggesting,
          Colette. You know how hard I work.

          totally supportive of your writing.

               one.HENRYGo.ALANC'mon.    Let's go.

     Colette marches off in a huff; Alan in pursuit. She looks
     over her shoulder, shouting back at Hannah.COLETTE13! 13!    13!     13!90   EXT. CITY BENCH - DAY                                              90Henry and Hannah sit on opposite ends of the bench. Hannah

     pile of Roaring Lion books under another handmade SIGN: 50%
     OFF! Sigrid stares at the pile of unwanted books in quiet
     contemplation. Heavy sigh.

     Sigrid glances up. Her boss watches her from the cash
     register with a certain longing. He smiles. Sigrid returns
     the smile.

     Back to business. Sigrid pulls a wad of DOLLAR BILLS from
     her hip pocket. Counts quickly. Then picks up John's books,
     one by one.94   INT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                     94John looks like the proverbial kid in a candy store.   In

     adventure, leaving Sigrid alone.

     Facing the camera, she nods slightly. Then offers us a small
     wave.SIGRIDBye.   Bye.95   INT. LOIS PIPER AGENCY - DAY                                      95The small reception area for The Lois Piper Agency. Tastefully
     decorated. PHONES constantly chirping.

     The young MALE ASSISTANT behind the counter, obviously paid
     to be patient, points to the framed sign on the counter, in
     large letters: NO UNSOLICITED MANUSCRIPTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.

     Colette and Dr. Xiroman will not be deterred. She holds a
     thick MANILA ENVELOPE.COLETTEI have to see Ms. Piper. We just
               need five minutes. 1-2-3-4-5 minutes
               of her time.

     The assistant points back to the sign.COLETTE (CONT'D)Can you just please stick your head
               in her office, tell her that Colette
               Mooney is here. I know she's busy,
               but she'll certainly want to see my
               manuscript.

     The assistant ignores her.COLETTE (CONT'D)(Flustered)
               I'm a graduate of Mills College.

     Behind them, coming from the inner office, we hear LOIS PIPERYELLING.LOIS (O.S.)If I have to read one more vampire
               story, I swear I'll drive a stake
               through my own goddamn heart.

     MANUSCRIPT comes flying out of her office. Loose pages
     splatter everywhere in the main office. Lois Piper quickly
     follows. Older. Tired. Needs a drink. Now.CAPTION: LOIS PIPER76.LOIS (CONT'D)Vampires! Zombies! Harry Potter
               knock-offs! People writing about

     It is at that moment when Lois first notices the camera.
     Caught off-guard. What the hell??? Colette cranes her neck
     over the assistant.COLETTEMs. Piper?   Ms. Piper?

     Lois turns her attention to Colette. Who are you? Then--
     magically--Lois changes. A big smile replaces the scowl.
     She marches towards Colette, who is clearly not expecting a
     warm reception.

     Lois walks right past Colette and instead warmly shakes hands
     with Dr. Xiroman.LOISDr. Xiroman. I can't believe you're
               here. How lovely to see you again.

     Dr. Xiroman nods his head in greeting.LOIS (CONT'D)Just in the neighborhood? Please
               come in for a minute.

     Another glance at the camera. Then, taking Dr. Xiroman by
     the elbow, Lois guides him back towards her office, completely
     snubbing a bewildered Colette.LOIS (CONT'D)My family talks about you all the
               time. You were so helpful to my
               sister. She's doing much better.

     Colette stands there helplessly, watching her future walk
     away. The assistant points in their direction: Get in there!96   INT. PIPER OFFICE - DAY                                          96Lois plops down behind her desk. Stacks of MANUSCRIPTS cover
     her desk. Dr. Xiroman sits quietly in one chair. Colette
     sits next to him.LOIS(Sighing; Distraught)
               Look at my desk, Dr. Xiroman. Look
               at all this. Do you know what it is?

               Crap. I hate my job. I hate my life.77.Dr. Xiroman nods: I understand.LOIS (CONT'D)Know what I feel like doing?

She looks at the camera.LOIS (CONT'D)Come in closer. I want you to get
          this. Closer. C'mon. More. Closer.

Satisfied, Lois takes her free hand and SHOVES ALL THE
MANUSCRIPTS off her desk, sending them flying on the floor.LOIS (CONT'D)Wheeeeee!

Colette looks aghast.   Lois seems free at last.LOIS (CONT'D)That was so...liberating. I haven't
          felt this good since that night in
          Paris with Salman Rushdie.

Lois growls like a tiger at the memory.LOIS (CONT'D)I envy you, Dr. Xiroman. Know that?
          Look at your life. Your work. You
          helped my sister. You've helped so
          many people. You have such a positive
          message to share.

The camera picks up on Lois as the light goes on, the wheels
start turning in her head.LOIS (CONT'D)Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a
          minute. A positive message to share.
          Helping people. That's it!COLETTE(Confused)

               call in New York.COLETTEBut--But.   What about me?

     Lois shoots her a look: What about you? Colette backs down--
     not wanting to spoil the moment. Lois yells for her assistant.
     Finally a slight smile crosses Dr. Xiroman's face.97   INT. PIPER OFFICE - DAY                                            97Dr. Xiroman beams as he signs the standard agency contract
     so quickly drawn up for him. Lois and her Assistant appear
     equally excited.

     COLETTE fidgets off to the side. Then Lois hands her the pen
     and points her towards the contract.COLETTE (V.O.)Co-Authors. Actually I'll be listed

      LAUGHTER. Door swings open. Richard stands there, wearing
      only his jeans. His hair is a mess.RICHARDYou're late, Pizza Boy.

      Richard finally notices the camera.RICHARD (CONT'D)What the --HENRY(Overlapping)

      hands it to Henry. Then reconsiders, calling inside.RICHARDBabe, I need a single.

      No response.RICHARD (CONT'D)C'mon, babe. Got a dollar for Pizza

      Richard gives a last glance to the camera. He's got better
      things to do. Off he goes.

      Short beat. Hannah comes to the door wearing Richard's shirt
      and little else, carrying a single dollar bill.HANNAHHere you--

      Her words freeze up as she recognizes Henry. Henry and Hannah
      lock eyes for a long beat. Poor kid. This is the moment.80.Reality smacks him in the face. Hard.

Hannah starts to hand Henry the money. He puts his hands up:

      Henry has no comeback. Hannah stares him down. The dollar
      bill drops from her hand on to the ground. She retreats
      back inside the house, firmly closing the front door, leaving
      Henry alone.

      Only then do we notice the number of the house: 4441.101   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                   101We've never seen Henry like this. He rips down all his Richard
      Benedict photos from the wall. Collects all his Benedict
      books. Stuffs everything in a CARDBOARD BOX. Next he turns
      his attention to all the rejection letters on the wall. Lot
      of rejection. Gives them a long look. Then he snaps up the
      photo of Hannah from near his computer. He takes the photo
      and tacks it dead center in the middle of all his rejection
      letters.

      Henry stares at the photo, oblivious to the camera, consumed
      by Hannah's radiant smile. His latest, and most painful,
      rejection. It's over.

      Henry understands what must be done. He goes over to his
      desk. Sits down at his laptop. One last glance over at
      Hannah's photo as he turns the computer on.

      He contemplates for a second. Then begins typing.102   INT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                    102Sigrid's Wall of America has been taken down. A few nail

from Hannah. Looks satisfied. FRONT DOOR opens again. MORE

          me. Today's the 22nd. Two plus two

John snatches up his folder and marches out of the house.
Silence. Colette starts to sit down at the table--motions
for Xiroman to join her. Final straw for Alan. Stares
directly at Colette.ALANGet out.    Now.

Colette can't believe what she's hearing.ALAN (CONT'D)As the leader of this writing group,

          to working with a real doctor. On

Colette and Dr. Xiroman disappear. Frustrated, Alan takes a
deep breath. Reaches inside his coat pocket for his recorder.
Turns it on.ALANIdea for novel.

Alan hesitates. Thinks for a second. Turns off the recorder.
Slides it across the table to Henry.ALAN (CONT'D)Here. Take it. Maybe you can use
          some of my ideas in your novel.

Alan flashes a "thumbs up" sign to Henry and to Hannah.    He
starts to leave, but remembers the camera.ALAN (CONT'D)(To camera)

      PHOTO adorns a POSTER announcing the publication of Sleeping

      Richard hovers around the makeshift bar, drink in hand.
      Maureen, looking radiant, accepts the congratulations of
      well-wishers. TABLE prominently centered has piles of Hannah's
      novel, waiting to be signed.

      Hannah talks to the camera, looking especially radiant. This
      is her day and she is more than ready for her close-up.
      Totally different in wardrobe and appearance.HANNAHExciting, isn't it? I'm so nervous.
                I don't know half these people. Most
                of them are Richard's friends.

      behind her helping to orchestrate the line of people.

      Hannah acts very gracious. Signing a book, smiling and
      chatting up the guests. She seems at ease. Everything is
      going her way. She looks past the line. Her eyes light up
      and she jumps to her feet.88.HANNAHOh my God!

Hannah bolts from the table, cuts through the line and finds
Henry standing alone.HENRYHi, Hannah.HANNAHHenry. Ohhhhh. Thank you. Thank
          you. Thank you so much for coming.

Hannah throws her arms around Henry, giving him a long
heartfelt hug, almost smothering the poor guy--not that he
complains. She lets go and gives Henry a friendly once-over.HANNAH (CONT'D)You're the only one from the group
          who showed up.

                husband, my co-author, and my agent.
                But I still have Nyet, Not Yet. And
                I will find an agent to sell my novel.
                Look. I bought an ad in the trades.

      Colette reaches for her reading glasses and shares the ad
      copy with us, reading aloud:COLETTE (CONT'D)"The magic fingers that just typed

      Looking quite pleased with herself, Colette lets the copy
      fall away.COLETTE (CONT'D)It's how I met my last husband. I

      She is talking to the camera. CREW in the background.HANNAHLet's see. My book ended up on the

             I've gone back to school!

To underscore the point, she holds up a the book--it's The
Great Gatsby.HANNAH (CONT'D)Look what I'm reading for class.
             Isn't that pretty, you know, what do

She hears an answer.HANNAH (CONT'D)Ironic. That's it. Pretty ironic.
             But I'm going to get my degree.
             Then I'll be smart. Really smart.

Short beatHANNAH (CONT'D)You know how you kept asking me that
             question. Who's my favorite writer?

Short beat.HANNAH (CONT'D)Turns out I do have one. Mr. Henry
             Obert. He's become a great writer.
             A published author.

She smiles.HANNAH (CONT'D)I knew him when.

She likes her answer.    But then hesitates.HANNAH (CONT'D)Probably shouldn't tell him I said

She winks.HANNAH (CONT'D)Keep it between us.

                good writing is swimming under water
                and holding your breath. He was right.

      Wait a minute--we recognize those trendy glasses. It's Eudora,
      a rather pregnant Eudora.EUDORA(Laughing)
                Yes, I'm totally busted. I'm buying
                four copies of A Slice of LA. One
                for each member of my writing group.
                Also because I think Henry Wayne
                Obert is the greatest new writer of
                the decade! Sexiest, too!

      happily signing copies of his book for the SHORT LINE OF
      PEOPLE waiting.

      This is his moment, the one that brought him all the way
      from Illinois. He has arrived. As a person. As a writer.

      Henry looks up. Eudora is nestled comfortably in a nearby
      leather chair, reading away. She looks up.

      They make eye contact. Her smile is all the encouragement
      Henry needs. All that he will ever need.

      He reaches for the next book to sign.FADE OUT:
