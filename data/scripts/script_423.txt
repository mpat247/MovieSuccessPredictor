DESERT  NILE RIVER  VALLEY - DAYSomewhere in the Nile at the edge of the desert.CREDITS  ROLLWRITTEN:	EGYPT 1913OMAR and his mule zigzag along the bottom of sun scorched dunes.2	EXT.  TEMPLE  EXCAVATION - DAYThe mule and the boy finally reach a camp.  A few tents dwarfed by a huge
temple door jutting out of the sand.  The camp is deserted except for
some kids by the temple entrance holding large mirrors, reflecting light
into the temple.
	Omar leaves his mule in the shade, seizes two goatskins and slips inside
the temple.3	INT.  TEMPLE - DAYOmar makes his way uneasily down a pillared corridor that opens into a
vast room where an old scientist stands on a small wooden ladder in front of
the wall across the room.  PROFESSOR MASSIMO PACOLI. A young man is beside
him, BILLY MASTERSON, age 25, an American student. He has a large sketchpad in
his hands.  Behind them AZIZ, age 10, whose job is to hold the last
mirror which shines light into the expansive room.PROFESSOR(deciphering)
				"..when the three planets are in eclipse.."

	His fingers trace across the wall which is covered with symbols and
strange hieroglyphs as he deciphers.PROFESSOR"..the black hole like a door is open...
				Evil comes ... sowing terror and chaos..."
				See?  The snake, Billy.  The Ultimate Evil
				... make sure you get the snake!

	The Professor points emphatically to the snake, the symbol of Evil,
coming through the door between the three planets in eclipse.  C.U.
Billy's hand sketches the snake quickly.  He is a natural artist.BILLYAnd when is this door opening snake act
				supposed to occur?

	The Professor's fingers touch the signs.PROFESSOR..if this is the five..and this the thousand..

	He calculates.PROFESSOREvery five thousand years..BILLY(kidding)
				So I have some time..

	He reaches for the pad.

	ANGLE ON:  Omar.  Standing at the entrance to the chamber with the water
bag, entranced by the sight.  A skeletal hand falls on his shoulder.  Omar
turns to an ancient PRIEST in a rough milled black cannock.PRIESTI will take it to them my son.

	Startled but obedient, Omar gives the water bag to the Priest.PRIESTGo with God.. be safe from Evil..

	The Priest makes the sign of the Cross on the boy's forehead, dismissing
him.
	As soon as he is gone, the Priest turns a worried eye to the Professor.

	ANGLE ON:  The Professor is back to translating, Billy to sketching.PROFESSOR"..then arrange the elements of life against
				the Terror just so.."

	His fingers run on.PROFESSOR"..Water..fire..earth..air..four
				elements around the fifth.."

	His fingers fall on the one element that has a human shape, surrounded by
all the others.

	The Priest opens the water skin and begins to pour a vial of powder into
the skin.

	ANGLE ON:  Aziz falling asleep.  The mirror falls, the light fails.PROFESSORAziz!  Light!

	The boy struggles to stay awake.  The mirror comes up.PRIESTLord forgive me.. they already know too,
				much..PROFESSOR"..in which all the history of the Universe resides
				..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from
Evil.."PRIEST (V.O.)Amen..

	The Professor turns to the Priest who is pouring water into a tin cup
from the skin.PROFESSORFather.. it in the most extraordinary thing..
				the greatest find in history..can you imagine
				the implications.PRIESTOnly too well... here you must be
				parched..

	He hands the cup to the Professor.  The Professor takes it, has it almost
to his lips when..PROFESSORI mean look.. it is like a battle plan..

	In his excitement he does not drink, much to the Priest's chagrin.PROFESSORHere the Good.. Here the Evil..

	As the Priest looks up, Aziz the mirror  boy, tips his mouth under the
water skin, drinking the leakage.PROFESSORHere..

	He points to the Five Elements.PROFESSORA weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am
				going to be famous.PRIESTThen let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..

	The Priest hands Billy a cup.PRIESTDrink!PROFESSORTo fame.. salud..

	The Professor raises the cup to drink, and then...PROFESSORWe cannot toast with water.. Billy !
				In my sack.. the Grappa!

	The Priest watches, disconsolate, as the Professor tosses away his water.
Billy finishes his cup before running off into the tunnel.4	EXT.  COLONNADE - DAYA muffled SOUND grows steadily louder. Outside, a monstrous linear shadow
disturbs the kid's game and gradually darkens the temple entrance.5	INT.  TUNNEL - DAYBilly is looking for the grappa in the Professor's bag.  He comes upon a
machine pistol.  When the muffled SOUND suddenly grabs his attention.  He
leans toward the corridor and sees part of a spaceship appear.  Billy is
paralyzed.6	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM - DAYThe Professor keeps reading over the inscription.PROFESSOR"..this perfect person.. this perfect
				being.." I do not understand this.. perfect?PROFESSORWhere is that boy? Billy!7	INT.  TUNNEL - DAYBilly presses himself against the wall, in the shadows, terrified, but
sketching away like mad, as large shadowed figures lumber past him.  He
begins to blink, feeling the effects of the Priest's potion..8	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM - DAYThe Professor reads the wall.PROFESSORAnd this divine Light they talk
				about.. what is Divine light?

	At that moment, the reflection from Aziz's mirror drops again.  The light
fails.PROFESSOR(without turning)
				Aziz light!

	The room is flooded with light all of the sudden.PROFESSORBetter.. this is the most unbelievable thing
				I have ever seen..

	The Professor turns around, and is stunned speechless to find himself
face to face with two MONDOSHAWANS.  A dozen others fill the hall manning
the source of the light, large luminous globes.  Aziz is fast asleep.PROFESSOR(uncomprehending)
				...Uh, yes?

	The Professor is lifted up and carried off to the side by the aliens.
The KOMMANDER stops in front of the Priest who is still on his knees, face
to the ground.PRIESTMaster... He was about to discover everything,
				but I had the situation under control.

	The two MONDOSHAWAN GUARDS hold the professor three feet off the ground.PROFESSOR(in a panic)
				Who are you?  Are you Germans?  Sprechen
				Sie Deutsch?9	INT.  TUNNELBilly staggers forward, a machine pistol in his hand.10	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOMThe KOMMANDER holds out his hand to the Priest.PRIESTWhat did I do wrong?

	The Priest jumps to his feet excitedly.KOMMANDERServant, you and the thousand guards
				before you... You have done your work well,
				but we have to recover the elements. War will
				soon engulf your planet. We must keep them safe.

	The Kommander goes over to the wall and seems to be looking for a lock.
He finds it and slides in his metallic finger which is more intricate
than a key to a safe.  He turns his hand, activating a mechanism that opens
the wall.PROFESSORUnbelievable!!!

	The Kommander turns around and crooks a finger.  One of the MONDOSHAWANS
	waves his hand, puts the professor to sleep and heads down the hallway
revealed by the opening.  He is followed by his men.  The Priest slips in
behind them.11	INT.  ROOM 2  TEMPLE - DAYThe Kommander steps into a vast room.  The ceiling is very high, pyramid-
shaped.  In each corner of the room, four vessels contain four
rectangular twelve-inch stones-, the four elements.  In the middle, an
opaque sarcophagus rests on an altar.  The Kommander stops and
contemplates it a moment.PRIEST(to himself)
				The Fifth Element...KOMMANDERTake them and put them in a safe place.

	His men carry out his order.12	INT.  ROOM 1  TEMPLE - DAYBilly staggers across the floor, struggling to stay awake.13	INT.  ROOM 2  TEMPLE - DAYThe Kommander opens a case.  His men come and put the four, precious
stones in it, one by one.PRIEST(moved)
				Will the elements be gone now forever
				from this place?KOMMANDERWhen mankind comes to its senses.
				We will return.PRIESTKnowing mankind as I do, that could take
			centuries!KOMMANDERTime is of no importance, only life
				is important.

	The Priest nods and lowers his eyes.

	Angle on:  Billy staggering forward, raising his pistol, blinking his
eyes to focus..

	A MONDOSHAWAN puts the fourth element in the case The Kommander shuts the
	case and looks at the Priest.KOMMANDERWhen EVIL returns so shall we.PRIEST(head lowered)
				We will be ready, Lord.

	Billy suddenly staggers into the room, brandishing his gun.BILLYStop.

	Billy trips, the gun goes off.  He empties the clip.  The Mondoshawan
carrying the case crumples to the ground.  The wall immediately begins to
close.  Billy fires wildly, unable to control the powerful kicking gun.PRIESTNo!!!  Don't!!!

	The Priest rushes Billy.  The weapon has such a kick to it that Billy
starts shooting into the air, backs up, then stumbles and knocks himself
out.  The Priest is on the ground, seriously wounded.  So is the Kommander.
The WARRIORS are in a panic.CLERKHurry, Kommander!  The wall's closing!!!

	The wall continues to close.  Sand pours in from everywhere.  The vast
room fills up like an hourglass.KOMMANDERA mission is a mission, Savoia.
				You'll learn that.

	The Kommander picks up the case and reaches the wall but can't get
through it.  His
	armor is too bulky, the opening too small.  He manages to get his arm and
the case through.KOMMANDERMy apologies to General Kroi -- and my wife..

	The wall closes, crushing his arm.  The CLERK scoops up the case and runs
	through the huge piles of sand.14	EXT.  COLONNADE - DAYThe CLERK boards the ship carrying the case.  Omar hides in a corner,
frightened to death, hugging Billy's bag of drawings.15	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM - DAYThe room fills with sand.  The Priest's body is soon buried.16	EXT.  DESERT - DAYThe huge ship's main hatch closes.17	EXT.  TEMPLE - DAYThe ship lifts off and speeds away. Omar emerges from the temple gaping
at the ship as it vanishes in the sky.18	EXT.  PYRAMIDSA gigantic shooting star flashes above the pyramids.19	EXT.  EARTH  ORBITThe ship passes in front of us and heads for the stars disappearing at
unbelievable speed.  The background is a star-spattered cosmos.WRITTEN:	500 YEARS LATERAnother, more modern, spaceship, fills the screen.  A warship belonging
to the Federal Army.20	INT.  SPACESHIP  CONTROL  ROOMCU of a digital control screen.  Three planets projecting three straight
lines that crisscross at one point.  Identical to the one observed by the
professor on the temple wall.  GENERAL STAEDERT looks out through the
ship's window at one of the three huge planets in eclipse.STAEDERTDon't you have anything?  Not even
				a temperature?CAPTAINThe thermo-analyzers have jammed.
				One of them reads over a million degrees,
				the other's at minus 5000...
				Never seen anything like it.TECHNICIANIt's taking shape.21	EXT.  SPACEIn the middle of the shadows, a door to the nightmare has just opened.
Evil is back.  A round, moving mass, continually changing color.CAPTAIN(in awe)
				What the hell can it be?TECHNICIANHook-up with the president in one
				minute, General.

	General Staedert remains calm.STAEDERT...Send out a probe.22	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE  MANHATTANLINDBERG, 50, the president of the United Federations, his features lined
and worn by various delegations, mainly military, enters his office.
There's a crisis in the air.  The President's AIDE leans down to his ear.AIDEOn air in 30 seconds.

	In the middle of the group is a Priest whose appearance reminds us of
Egypt.  A younger man DAVID, 18, shy, a priest-in-training attends the old
man.23	INT.  CONTROL  ROOM / PRESIDENT'S  OFFICECAPTAINPresident on line sir..

	General Staedert leans over his screen and seems surprised to see the
room but not the president.PRESIDENT (O.S.)Staedert, do you read me?STAEDERTI can hear you, Mr. President, but I
				can't see you .

	The President grabs the mini-camera on his desk and yanks it around to
face him.
	His face fills the screen.PRESIDENT(exasperated)
				Is that better?STAEDERTPerfect, Mr. President.PRESIDENTI have to address the Supreme Council
				in 10 minutes.
				Just the facts, General.STAEDERTThere are no results from the chemical
				and molecular analysis as of yet, all the
				calibers are overshot..we're hoping a
				thermo nucleatic imaging..PRESIDENT(exasperated)
				What you are saying is you don't know
				what this..thing..is.

	Consternation reigns in the President's office.STAEDERTNot yet Sir..The only thing we know is
				it just keeps getting bigger!PRESIDENTOptions.STAEDERTWait or act.PRESIDENTRecommendations.STAEDERTMy philosophy Mr. President is shoot first
				ask questions later.
				I don't like uninvited guests.PRESIDENTGentlemen?HEAD CHEMISTSI think it would be foolish to shoot at an
				organism that seems alive, without first
				taking the time to study it more!
				Besides, it has shown no signs of hostility.PRESIDENT(worried)
				No... it's just getting bigger.HEAD CHEMISTSSo do people, but that's no reason to shoot
				them.PRESIDENT(exasperated)
				The security of the Federated Territories is
				and remains number one priority.
					(to the military)
				I suppose General Staedert's "philosophy" is
				acceptable to you?

	All the Generals nod "yes"PRESIDENTAll right, then! Staedert?PRIEST (O.S.)Mr. President?

	The President scans the room. Staedert remote controls the camera toward
the room.PRESIDENT...Yes?

	The camera moves up the Priest and we finally discover his face.  He is
in his sixties, a shrewd look in his eyes.
	Around his neck hangs the Kommander's finger, the key to the temple.PRIESTCornelius, Vito Cornelius. 50th level parish.
				I have a different theory to offer you,
				Mr. President.PRESIDENTI'm listening.CORNELIUSImagine for a moment that this. thing is not
				anything that can be identified because it prefers
				not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are.
				Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.PRESIDENT(a little sarcastically)
				One more reason to shoot first eh?

	All the Generals nod in agreement.CORNELIUSEvil begets evil, Mr. President.
				Shooting would only make it stronger.24	INT.  SPACESHIPTECHNICIANThe probe will attain its objective in
				five seconds.

	Staedert moves closer to the ship's window.25	EXT.  SPACE.Evil swallows the probe and immediately bubbles over with activity like a
furious volcano.26	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICESTAEDERTMr. President, we're at crisis point.

	The President looks puzzled.PRESIDENTYour theory is interesting Father but
				I don't think we have time to go into it
				right now!CORNELIUSTime is of no importance, Mr. President.
				Only life is important.PRESIDENT(exasperated)
				That's exactly what we are going to try and do:
				Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our
				fellow citizens! General?
				You may fire when ready.27	INT.  SPACESHIPSTAEDERT(cold) (to the CAPTAIN)

A black crust immediately covers it.29	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICESCIENTIST(consulting new data)

				Mr. President.

	The President hesitates.CAPTAIN...The ship is in combat formation.
				The missile is loaded, General.PRESIDENT(uneasy)
				Staedert?  Give me a minute...
				I have a doubt.STAEDERT(cold)
				I don't, Mr. President.30	EXT.  OUTSIDE  SPACESHIPThe missile explodes from the ship and penetrates its target.  The
explosion is swallowed like a fizzy pill in a small glass of water.
Nothing happens.  And then the mass grows larger.31	INT.  CONTROL  ROOM / PRESIDENT'S  OFFICEStaedert looks worried.STAEDERTLoad a series of 740 missiles. Maximum
				shield protection.CAPTAINYes, Sir.

	The President is growing ever more worried.PRESIDENTStaedert?  What's going on?  Did you
				destroy it?STAEDERTI'm about to, Mr. President.32	EXT.  SPACESHIPA series of three missiles heads for the planet, which absorbs them all.
And literally doubles in size.SCIENTISTThe planet's diameter has greatly
				increased and it's moving toward the ship.PRESIDENTStaedert?  Get out of there immediately!
				I don't want an incident, do you hear me,
				Staedert?STAEDERT(worried)
				...What do we have that's bigger than 240?CAPTAINNothing, General.PRESIDENTStaedert, get out of there!  That's an order!

	A bead of sweat pearls Staedert's forehead. He is about to give an order
when a gigantic flame emerges from the planet and literally swallows
Staedert's spaceship.STAEDERT(eyes wide)
				... Good God!

	The flame fills the screen with a horrendous NOISE that....33	INT.  APARTMENT... wakes up a man trying to escape from a nightmare. KORBEN DALLAS rubs
his head.  Thirty five years old, short hair, powerfully built,
unquestionable charm, good looking in spite of the scars here and there.
The alarm clock is still ringing, it shows the date as March 18, 2359.  It
in two in the morning. Ha grabs a cigarette, and stops to look for a
light.  He shuts oft the alarm.  He hears a cat mewing in the hall.  But it
	still rings.  Korben takes a moment and then realizes it in the phone
that is ringing.KORBEN(to the cat)
				I'm coming.

	He grabs the phone and crosses his tiny apartment (27 feet long by 6 feet
wide) heading for the door, patting himself for a light.  Behind him, the
bed makes itself automatically.KORBEN(on the phone)
				Yeah?FINGER (V.O.)Hey bud! Finger here.

	He opens the door for the cat and starts to rummage through a drawer for
a match. Out come a handful of war decorations, a hero's collection.KORBEN(to the cat)
				Hi sweetie!

	...A Medal of Honor Certificate to Major DallasFINGER (V.O.)I love you too Major, but you haven't called
				me that since basic training.KORBENI was talking to the cat.FINGER (V.O.)Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer
				your cat to the real thing.

	...A picture of Korben and Finger in uniform next to a space fighter.KORBENI just found a picture of you.FINGER (V.O.)How do I look?KORBENLike shit.

	Korben finds a box of matches with three matches.  He strikes one. It
does not light.  Korben opens the fridge, bare, except for an empty can of
GEMINI croquettes.
	On the packet is an ad:WIN A DREAM TRIP FOR 2 TO FHLOSTON PARADISE.FINGER (V.O.)Must be an old picture.. Listen, you gotta bring
				me your hack for the 6 month overhaul.  A.S.A.P.

	Korben heats up some brackish water.KORBEN(sighs)
				I don't need one.FINGER (V.O.)You forgetting who sat next to you for
				a thousand missions.

				space fighter!!FINGER (V.O.)How many points you got left on your
				license?KORBEN(lying)
				Uh... at least fifty.FINGER (V.O.)In your dreams! See you tonight!

	Finger has hang up.  Korben sighs and does the same.  He gets the heated
brackish water and sits down.  The cat pounces on the table and meows for
its food.  Korben pours half the coffee in the cat's cup.

	The cat meows.  Korben taps his cup to the cat's saucer.KORBENCheers!34	INT.  HALL - DAY - OMIT35	INT.  GARAGE - DAY - OMIT36	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICEThe office is emptied, only a few army officers remain.  An ancient

	point.CORNELIUS(to the President)
				We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs
				to adapt itself to our living conditions.PRESIDENT(worried)
				And then?CORNELIUSAnd then it will be too late. The goal of
				evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life.
				For all eternity...Life upsets it.

				The Mondoshawans don't belong to the

				in their possession are the four elements of life.
				These elements when they are gathered around a fifth:
				The Supreme Being, ultimate warrior, created to protect
				life......

	The SUPREME BEING is standing, as if frozen in armor.  All we see is the
bottom half of his body.  Big metallic gloves hold the case engraved with
the emblem of the three suns containing the four Sacred Stones.CORNELIUS..will produce what the ancients called the
				light of creation, the light of total goodness
				which is the only thing that can defeat EVIL.

				this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL
				who stands here?CORNELIUSWhite turns to black.  Light to Dark.
				Life to Death.  For all eternity.

hand, sending him down for the count.  Korben retrieves the gun.KORBEN..you know these things are VERY illegal..

full of similar guns! The mugger's eyes pop out of his head.  He scampers
to his feet and runs off.

	PROFESSOR MACTILBURGH, age 60, hurries alongside GENERAL MUNRO.MUNROThis is all that survived?MACTILBURGHActually only one cell survived..MUNROHave you identified it?MACTILBURGHIt's not that easy..we've never encountered
				anything like it before..you see normal human
				beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is
				more than enough for any species to perpetuate
				itself..This one has 200,000.MUNROTalk English Doc.MACTILBURGHThis cell is like a huge library. It has infinite
				genetic knowledge stored inside.
				Almost like it was...engineered.MUNROSounds like a freak of nature to me.MACTILBURGHYes... I can't wait to meet him.

	They pass into the lab.53	INT.  LABORATORYThe two enter a cylindrical laboratory.  There is a huge glass turbine in
the middle with the metal glove inside.  A DNA chain scrolls on the computer
screen.MACTILBURGH(rather fascinated)
				The compositional elements of his DNA
				chain are the same as ours, there are simply
				more of them tightly packed.
				His knowledge is probably limitless..MUNRO(worried)
				Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?MACTILBURGHWe put it through the cellular hygiene detector.
				The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.

	Munro hesitates a moment.  Then he sighs and uses his personal key to
open the
	self-destruct box.MUNROOK, go ahead! But Mr. Perfect better be polite...
				otherwise I turn him into cat food.

	Mactilburgh starts the operation rolling as Munro puts his hand on the
sell-destruct button, ready to use it.  Thousands of cells form in the
heart of the generator, an assemblage of DNA elements.  Then the cells move
down a tube, like a fluid, and gather in an imprint of a HUMAN body.  Step
by step bones are reconstructed, then the nervous and muscular systems.
Whole veins wrap around the muscles.  An entire body is reconstructing before
our very eyes.DOCTORThree seconds to ultra-violet protection.

	A shield comes over the reconstructing body and makes it invisible.MACTILBURGH(to Munro)
				...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction
				of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly
				greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells
				to react, to protect themselves.
				That means growing skin. Clever, eh?MUNRO(disgusted)
				Wonderful!

	The meter slows, drops to zero.ASSISTANT... End of reconstruction, beginning of
				reanimation .

	A whoosh of air in the glass chamber.  Captain Munro has his hand on the
self-destruct button, ready to destroy the being that has barely been
reborn.MACTILBURGH(pushing a button)
				Activate life support system.

	An electrical discharge fills the glass chamber causing the body inside
to jerk.
	After a few moments of silence, the SOUND of a heartbeat fills the room
over the loudspeaker.ASSISTANTLife support system activated.

	The Supreme Being is alive once again.MACTILBURGHRemove the shield.

	The ASSISTANT automatically removes the ultra-violet shield which slowly
reveals... a woman... nude... young... and very beautiful.  Munro stands there
gaping.  Not quite his vision of the Supreme Being.  Mactilburgh glances
at Munro and gently pushes his hand away from the self-destruct button.MACTILBURGH(with a smile)
				I told you ... perfect!

	Munro is hypnotized by the GIRL's beauty.MUNRO...I'd, uh , like to get a few pictures for the
archives
				before she wakes up.

	Mactilburgh looks at him with a grin.  A remote-control camera approaches
the girl's face, a flash goes off.  Blinded by the flash, the girl jumps and
screams.  She cowers in a corner, shaking from the cold, darting eyes
everywhere looking for the case she was holding.GIRL(very angry)

				What's she saying?MACTILBURGH(to his ASSISTANT)
				Activate the phonic detector.

	The girl kicks the window repeatedly.MACTILBURGHAnd give her a light sedative...
				and something to wear!

	The ASSISTANT hits a button.  A pile of clothes drops out of a trapdoor
in the ceiling.  She snatches up the clothes angrily and dresses quickly.
Munro draws closer to the glass window.  He watches her dress with
undisguised pleasure.MUNRO(to Mactilburgh)
				This thing solid?MACTILBURGH(smiling)
				An elephant couldn't crack it.

	The Girl finishes dressing.GIRL(angrily)
				Teno akta chataman assin-omekta!

	Munro smiles safely behind his plate glass window.MUNRO(with a smile)
				You're gonna have to learn to communicate
				better than that angel if you want out.

	Munro dangles the key on a chain that will let her out.  The girl rams
her fist right through the window.  She grabs the key and yanks it.  The
chain snaps tight and Munro slams into the window knocking himself out.  The
girl puts her hand through the window again, unlocks the chamber and steps
out.  She is still bit wobbly on her legs.  Two GUARDS try to grab her.
She sends them flying across the room. Mactilburgh is most impressed.  He
sets off a general alarm.54	INT.  CORRIDOR  LABORATORYThe girl runs through a maze of corridors looking for a way out.  A squad
of SECURITY GUARDS appear in front of her and open fire without warning. The
girl takes a leap, grabs an air vent, kicks it out and dives into the air
shaft.  The COPS try and jump up to the vent, but none can reach it.CHIEFGet me a chair or a stepladder The rest of you
				go through the main ventilation!55	INT.  VENTILATION DUCT  LABORATORYThe girl moves along unable to see what's ahead of her. She comes to a
dead-end, a grill that leads outside.  She pushes it out and exits onto
the ledge.56	EXT.  LEDGE  LABORATORY - DAWNShe has exited to a ledge on the 450th floor of a building, right in the
middle of Manhattan, which we discover for the first time.  The city has
become monstrous. Buildings rise 600 stories.  Cars fly.  Subways run
vertically...The girl edges along the narrow ledge, unfazed by the height.
The CHIEF leans out the vent, looking out into the void.CHIEF(to his men)
				Go on follow her!

	The COPS stare into the gaping void.COP...No way.

	The CHIEF angrily pulls out his gun and shoots at the girl who ducks
around the corner of the building.  Unfortunately the other side in full of
cops as well.  A flying police car zooms up in front of her, sirens
blaring.VOICE (O.S.)This in the police.  Your status is illegal.
				Please put up your hands and follow our
				instructions!

	The girl feels trapped.  She looks down into the endless 450 below and
all the cars flying underneath her.  Then she raises her arms... and dives
off.57	INT.  POLICE  CAR - NIGHTCOP(in the car.)
				Christ! She dove off!

	In a panic, the COP makes a wrong turn.  The girl falls for several
seconds.
	She lands on the roof of a flying cab.58	INT.  CAB - NIGHTKorben tries to control his car, reeling from the impact.VOICE (O.S.)You have just had an accident.

	Korben manages to stop his cab, pulls over to the side.VOICE / KORBENYou have one point left on your license.
				Have a good day.

	Korben sighs and looks in the back seat to see what the damages are.  The
girl, a bit dazed (who wouldn't be), emerges from the debris and sits up.
There's some blood on her face.  Korben is stunned. The girl's still alive
and... so beautiful.  His heart heads for a meltdown.GIRLAkina delutan, nou-shan.KORBEN(lost)

				Sorry, Hon, but I only got one point left
				on my license and I gotta get to the garage!

	The police car presses up against the cab.  Doors slide open.  Huge guns
point at her.  Korben feels lousy.  The girl's helpless, there are tears in
her eyes, she looks exhausted.
	Korben glances at her in the rear view mirror. She's looking all around
to find something to help her communicate with him.

	Her POV: an ad on the back of the seat. An 800 number to help an
orphanage. A teary photo of a kid over the words Please Help.  She shoots
to Korben a look of pure distress.GIRL(irresistible)

	Korben shuts oft the meter and floors it, sideswiping the police car as
he roars away.VOICE (O.S.)Your license has been revoked.

	Korben whips out a gun and shatters the loudspeaker.KORBENI hate when people cry...

ensues.59	INT.  NEW YORK  STREETS - DAYKorben and his flying taxi are absolute masters of the air.  The cops

	Korben turns his cab sideways and scrapes through a narrow passageway,

wall.  The other one brakes just in time.COPShit! Attention all-patrol cars!

	The car makes a U-turn, looking for a wider passageway.60	EXT.  NEW YORK  STREETThe police car roars up, sirens screaming then slows down and checks out
a dead-end flanked by a large vertical neon billboard. The dead-end is empty .
Korben's cab is hidden vertically behind the billboard.  Seeing nothing, the

	Zorg falls, writhing, on his desk, inadvertently hitting buttons which
trigger a slew of little mechanisms.  They pop out all over the desk.
True chaos reigns.  Even a cage appears, holding a Souliman Aktapan, a fat
multicolored beastie, PICASSO, who seems surprised to be out in daylight.  He
licks his half-dead master in thanks.  Cornelius gets up and walks around
the desk.  Zorg motions for help.CORNELIUSCan I give you a hand?

His eyes fall on an old blanket.KORBENHere let me wrap you up.

	Korben wraps her in an blanket and vigoroualy rubs her back.  Leeloo
warms gradually and snuggles closer to that warm comfortable shoulder.
Korben's rubbing slows, looking more like caresses.KORBEN..It's funny.  I've met you twice today  and

begins to look around.  She opens a drawer and comes upon..KORBEN(nervously)

	Leeloo innocently sticks his finger in the jar then puts it in her mouth.KORBENIt... melts in your mouth, doesn't it?

	She savors the honey, slowly; sensually.  Her lips shine with honey.  Her
eyes narrow with pleasure.  Korben is hypnotized by her lips, like a moth
attracted to a flame.  He begins to lose control, which makes him nervous.

	An indistinct sound comes from the wall.  But Korben is so entranced with
the sight of Leeloo licking her honied fingers, he doesn't hear it until
it becomes quite a racket.KORBENYou hear that?LEELOO(licking)

	ANGLE ON: Korben comes rushing into the airport. Walking quickly, he

	Back a ways, Korben has spotted Leeloo and... David.  He heads right for

painting that is obviously upside down. A white chiffon veil covers the face
of the Diva, she stops in front of Leeloo.  The Diva reaches out and
strokes Leeloo's face, without touching her. The Diva removes her hand
making a sound of crackling electricity, then passes on.  Leeloo is groggy.

	It's obvious he doesn't know where to put it.KORBENDon't tell me you don't know how all

	Korben can't believe his ears.  He tears the Stone out of Cornelius' hand
and studies the inscriptions.  He goes over to one of the four bases the
stones rest on and tries to figure it out.  The symbol of air is on the Stone,
the same as on the base.KORBENMatch the symbols!

	Korben places the first Stone and picks up another one.  Cornelius has
found the symbol for water.  Loc Rhod sits down.  He is very tired.LOC RHODWhat is this some kinda game? Like

eyes.LOC RHODIt... it moved! Korben! Korben!

	Korben rushes over, looks at the Stone.  Hooks are undone.KORBENWhat did you say? What did you do?LOC RHODNothing! Swear to God, I didn't do

	Loc Rhod sighs, really depressed this time.  The Stone opens even more.
	Korben's got it.KORBENThe wind! The wind blows...

	Korben blows on the Stone which immediately opens revealing a patch of
blue sky with some miniature clouds floating around inside.  A yellow beam
pops up like a ray of sunlight, like Korben's smile.KORBENQuickly, everyone on a Stone!
				Water for water!  Fire for fire!
				Earth for earth!

	The two men move fast.  Korben on the 4th Stone: Earth.  He grabs a
fistful of earth  and throws it on the Stone.  A miniature patch of green
appears and immediately forms a green beam.  Cornelius wipes his forehead
with a scarf and wrings it out over the Stone.  It opens revealing a patch of
miniature raging sea.  A blue beam appears.

	Loc Rhod has a problem.LOC RHOD(shaking)
				I don't have a light.  I stopped smoking

	Korben pats his pockets, he comes up with a box of matches.  There's only
one left.KORBENDon't breathe.

	Loc Rhod and Cornelius hold their breath.  Korben strikes the match.  A
small flame appears on the tip.  A breeze goes through the room.  Korben
feels like he's got TNT in his hands.  He approaches the flame to the Stone.
The flame twists, dims, flickers ...but holds on.  The Stone opens.  A patch
of miniature fire appears. Korben sighs, snuffs out the match.  The fourth
beam, a red one, immediately forms.270	EXT.  SPACEA mass of fire fills the screen.  The Earth is only a thousand miles

	Korben slowly releases Leeloo and steps back from the altar.
	Leeloo can barely stand in the center of the four beams.
	An indistinct white beam begins to form around her, starts to rise.CORNELIUSCome on Leeloo! Come on!

Leeloo up and puts her back in the center of the beams.KORBENLeeloo! If you don't get on with the
