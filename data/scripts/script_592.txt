                   ahead. He did not say unforeseeable. No

    still, in a lift). Malcolm becomes aware of him.TOBYNo, it's fine, it's in the fridge. I put

                     the hardest fucking decision of my

                     together.GENERAL MILLERIt is - it is intolerable. I still agree
                     with myself about that. But I've got to
                     tolerate it. My loyalty is with the kids.

                     then I'm not a soldier? City hall don't

                     my soldier licence.KARENYou know this is an unnecessary war. It's
                     a war you don't believe in. Show me some
                     balls, George.GENERAL MILLERI know I've got balls, I don't need to
