             Nobody did anything?DEWEYThey thought it was a publicity
             stunt.SIDNEYOh my God. How could it happen?DEWEYThey don't know. It was carefully

   her ear.GALEI don't know... no one's talking.
             What's the studio's position? Never
             happen. They'd be stupid to pull
             the movie. With all this free press
             - they're gonna have huge numbers
             this weekend. It'll break box

   starts for her, excusing himself.SNOTTY GUYThe point is - I made my point.
             Sequels suck.INT. CORRIDOR - SAMEDerek and Sidney move out into the hallway. Derek
   throws his arms around her protectively.DEREKHow are you? You weren't in class.

             this.He moves on her, wrapping her in his arms and kissing
   her passionately. She breaks away, laughing.SIDNEYNo PDA.But it's a failed objection. He kisses her again and
   they're soon devouring each other like two people in
   love. Right in the middle of the hallway.CUT TO:EXT. STUDENT UNION - LATE AFTERNOONThe place is a circus. The front steps of the student

   that stands directly in the car's path.The Squad car makes direct contact with the lamp post,
   SLAMMING into it, bringing the car to a CRASHING HALT,
   lodging it agaisnt the building's stone exterior.Smoke rises from a bashed engine as it emits a fatal
   rumbling.INSIDE THE CARAll is still. In the backseat, Sidney rises from the
   floorboards. She looks up to see the Ghost Masked
   figure slumped over the steering wheel. Out.Sid quickly pulls herself together, looking about,
   sizing up her options. She tugs on the door handle. It
   won't budge. She looks to the passenger's side of the
   car. It's flush against the building.Then she notices the metal grate. The edge has been
   pried apart in the crash. Sidney reaches for it,
   pulling on it, bending it backwards...CREAK!Sid tries to stifle the noise it makes, all the while
   eyeing the Ghost who remains unconscious. She creates
   an opening large enough for her to crawl through. She
   lifts herself up and pulls herself through to the...FRONT SEATSid falls down into the seat, her eyes never leaving
   the Ghost. She lay crumpled up against the smashed
   passenger's door, the only sound is her own TERRIFIED
   BREATHING. She watches the Ghost Masked Figure. His
   body doesn't move. She contemplates her next move.The only way out is through the driver's door.After what seems an eternity, she slowly reaches over
   with her foot and nudges the Ghost. No movement.
   Nothing.She slides across the seat towards the Ghost, moving to
   his side. She reaches with her hand and pushes on the
   Ghost's shoulder. His body moves, slumping back against
   the back of the seat. It clears space for her to pass
   through.She sits up on her feet, facing the Ghost. With her
   leg, she reaches over him, straddling him. She leans
   against the steering wheel, her arm quickly reaching
   for the door knob.HONK!Her back brushes against the horn. Sid TENSES, her face
   a little more than a foot from the Ghost Mask. He
   doesn't move. He's completely out cold. Sid pushes the
   car door open and starts to slide completely over the
   Ghost when she stops.She looks to the Ghost.CLOSE ON HER FACEAs she fights with a decision. Then, with a fierce
   determination, Sid reaches for the Ghost Mask. She
   finds the edge and begins to peels the Mask away
   when...THE GHOST COMES TO LIFELunging forward. Sidney SCREAMS, leaping, falling out
   the car door.OUTSIDE THE CARBAM!Sid hits the pavement hard. She lifts herself up when
   her entire body is YANKED VIOLENTLY BACKWARDS.The Ghost has hold of her foot, pulling her back into
   the car. Sidney KICKS and WRITHES breaking free. She
   hops to her feet as the Ghost emerges from the car.
   Sidney SLAMS the car door shut. It catches the Ghost,
   knocking him backwards.Sid tears off, down the street, running, burning up the
   pavement.CUT TO:EXT. FILM SCHOOL - MINUTES LATERThe film school sits in the still darkness.INT. HALLWAY - SAMEDewey and Gale move down a dark and shadowed hallway.

   three levels of seats that shoot straight up to the

   from the ceiling in different places around the room.Dewey and Gale enter. If not for the red EXIT SIGNS
   that hang over the exit doors, the room would be
   completely dark.They move down the first level of chairs to the
   lecturn.GALEMaybe they never got here. He could
             have taken her anywhere.DEWEYC'mon. Let's go.CLICK! STATIC! A noise from above takes their
   attention. They looks up as a video monitor comes to
   life. Images appear.CLOSE ON MONITORHome-made video footage fills the screen. A movie
   theatre, people standing in line. The home camera ZOOMS
   in to a YOUNG COUPLE. Maureen and Phil come into view.ON DEWEY AND GALEGale watches the screen as Dewey looks around the room,
   searching for it's source.CLICK! Another monitor comes to life. More home shot
   video footage. This time of a big house. A closer look
   reveals it to be the Chi Omega Sorority House. A young
   girl stands on the front porch talking on a portable

   cellular phone to his ear.CLICK! Another monitor turns on. It's of a man and
   woman back to the camera. The couple move in frame. It
   becomes apparent quick. It's Gale and Dewey. As they
   stand in the room - live. They're being taped.CLOSE ON DEWEY AND GALEGALEShit!Dewey spins around. He reaches for the gun he no longer
   carries.DEWEYDammit!He looks around the room, up to the two levels above
   them. He spots a small light on the second level. He
   squints his eyes and sees a FIGURE standing behind it.GALELet's go.DEWEYNo, wait here.Dewey hands her his flashlight and takes off for the
   stair rise that leads to the upper level.GALENo, Dewey, let's call for backup.But Dewey is gone, leaving Gale alone. She turns to the
   monitor to see her face in fear-stricken CLOSEUP.ON THE UPPER LEVELDewey moves fast, limping his way to the level's edge.
   He approaches the railing and makes his way around to
   the shining light.He reaches it, finding nothing but a camera and tripod.
   It sits alone against the railing. Dewey surveys the
   second level. Empty seats everywhere. Completely bare.Dewey looks down to the main floor... to Gale who looks
   up to him.GALEDewey?DEWEYThere's nothing. I'm coming down.Dewey turns to leave, his eye catching a monitor that
   hangs level with the railing. On the monitor, Gale is
   in frame, looking up at Dewey, her face fear stained.
   She takes a step forward, moving out of frame,
   revealingTHE GHOSTWho stands right behind her. Dewey looks down to see
   the Ghost standing directly behind Gale.DEWEY (CONT'D)Watch out!DOWN BELOWGale turns just in time to see the gleam of a killer's
   knife as it darts out of the darkness. Gale catapults,
   just dodging it. She moves like lightning up the aisle
   of seats.UP ABOVEDewey races for the stairs, going as fast as his
   handicapped leg will allow.DOWN BELOWGale tears out the exit door, the Killer right behind

   She tears it open, disappearing into...INT. SOUND STAGE - SAMEGale finds herself in the student studios. She stands
   in a huge control booth that overlooks a dubbing stage.
   Lots of glass walls and doors. It has a maze quality.Gale moves out a side door and into a dubbing room.
   Darkness everywhere Gale stops for a second, listening
   as she main door CREAKS open. And then FOOTSTEPS are
   heard, making their way towards her.Gale proceeds deeper into the studio. She moves into a
   sound proof room and closes the door. Not seeing the...GHOST FIGUREThat stands behind her. She turns around and SCREAMS.
   She starts out, but then realizes he's standing in the
   control booth. She's protected by a clear, large,
   plexiglass window that wraps around the room. The ghost
   moves out the side door, heading her way. He disappears
   out of view. Gale freaks. She races to the door, trying
   to secure it. There's no lock.AT THE MAIN DOORDewey slips through quietly, trying his best to be
   quick on his toes. Through the control booth window, he
   immediately spots Gale.INSIDE THE DUBBING ROOMGale looks for objects to block the door with. She
   drags a shelf of sound equipment towards the door.OUTSIDE THE DUBBING ROOMDewey moves to the window.DEWEYGale! Gale!She doesn't hear him. The room is sound proof. He BEATS
   against the glass. Still, she doesn't turn to him.INSIDE THE DUBBING ROOMGale shoves everything she can find against the door,
   not seeing or hearing Dewey as he POUNDS against the
   sound proof barrier behind her.She also doesn't see the Killer that appears behind
   Dewey. He moves on him swift and focused.INSIDE THE DUBBING STAGEGale can't take her eyes off the door. Her face is
   terrified. If she'd only turn around, she would see
   Dewey - his face terror stricken as a knife is hurled
   into him repeatedely. With each thrust, blood is
   splattered against the glass.IN THE CONTROL BOOTHDewey SCREAMS for his life, caught completely off
   guard. He falls forward onto the control panels.
   Suddenly, microphone feedback tears through the studios
   as Dewey's CRIES are heard throughout the stage.IN THE DUBBING STAGEDewey's DEATH SCREAM rips through the room.Gale turns to the window to see Dewey, his face smashed
   against it, blood smeared across the glass. She moves
   to the window, her face only inches from his. A moment
   as their eyes meet. Dewey's life is near gone. His eyes
   reveal it.Gale BEATS against the glass window.GALE(through tears)NOOOOOOO!Dewey's body slides down, out of view. Gale is
   mortified. She looks to the Killer who has already made
   his way through the control booth. He's coming for her.
   She races to the door, throws the things away.She manages to pull the door open just enough to slide
   through. And she's off and running.Gale finds a door and plows through it, stopping only
   long enough to lock it.BAM! The Ghost RAMS it from the other side but it
   holds. Gale surveys her surroundings. She's in a
   storage room. She eyes another door. She moves through
   it and out into...THE HALLWAYGale shoots down it.CUT TO:EXT. CAMPUS STREET - SECONDS LATERSidney races down the deserted street. Not a soul in
   sight. She reaches a corner, moves off the road and
   passes through a series of trees and shrubs, coming out
   onto...EXT. SORORITY ROW - SAMEThe houses have long since gone to sleep. The Delta
   Zeta House stares at Sidney. Lights burn from within.
   Sid goes for it.EXT. DELTA ZETA FRONT PORCH - SAMESid makes her way up the front porch. She POUNDS on the
   front door, SCREAMING her lungs out.SIDNEYSOMEBODYPLEASEOPENUPSOMEBODY!Sid wastes no time, she moves along the wraparound
   porch, beating at the windows. But nothing. Everybody
   is off partying. Suddenly, Sid hears something. A
   WHIMPERING. She turns to find Murphy and Lois, laying,
   strewn across the end of the porch. Passed out.Sid runs to them.SIDNEY (CONT'D)Oh God, help me. We have to call
             the police.Sid kneels over Murphy, shaking her. Murphy's eyes open
   and she GIGGLES. The girl is completely wasted. She has
   no comprehension skills at all.SIDNEY (CONT'D)Do you have keys? I need to get
             inside.Sid looks to Lois. She's in worse shape.SIDNEY (CONT'D)Shit!Sid contemplates, not knowing what to do. She leaves
   them, moving down off the porch and around to the back
   of the house. She gets to the back door, tries it. It's
   locked too.Sidney checks out the yard. Off to the side, she spots
   a big tree with a...BODY, lying next to it in a heap on the ground She
   moves toward it.As Sid approaches she sees clearly that it's Mickey. He
   lay on his side, curled, knees to chest, his arm still
   chained to the tree.SIDNEY (CONT'D)Mickey? Mickey?A look of dread creeps across her face. He lay there
   very much dead.SIDNEY (CONT'D)Oh God, no, Mickey...She kneels over his body just as it stirs, lifting up,
   rising. Mickey's face comes into view, coated in dried
   funk, his eyes wide.MICKEYSid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've
             been here all night.SIDNEYListen to me. We've got to get
             help. The Killer's here.MICKEYWhat are you talking about?SIDNEYHe's after me.Mickey pulls on his chained arm.MICKEYShit! You've got to cut me down,
             Sid.Sid inspects the chain. It's meant to hold.SIDNEYI'll be right back.MICKEYWhere you going?Sidney moves to the shed that's attached to the garage.
   Leaning against the side are a row of garden tools. Sid
   settles on a shovel.Sid returns to Mickey who has risen to his feet. He's
   pulling and twisting the bike chain that binds him.SIDNEYWatch out.Sid lifts the shovel up and brings it down directly on
   the lock. It bends somewhat but stays in tact.MICKEYDo it again.CLANK! A noise behind them. They both spin around
   peering into the night.MICKEY (CONT'D)What was that?SIDNEYDon't panic.Sidney, determined, raises the shovel high and brings
   it down with great force. It CRACKS the lock, loosening
   it.Mickey pulls on it. It won't quite give.SIDNEY (CONT'D)Watch out.Sid raises the shovel again, unfaltering. She doesn't
   see the Ghost Masked Figure that slides down from the
   tree branch behind her. The Figure moves quickly and
   gracefully, coming to a stance directly behind Sid.Mickey looks up, just in time.MICKEYSIDNEYWATCHOUT!Sid turns just as the Killer strikes. But Sid is ready.
   Without thought, she swings the shovel at the Ghost,
   catching his mid-section, sending him flying.Mickey goes ballistic chained to the tree. He pulls,
   twists, squirms... anything to free himself.The Ghost rises, moving on Mickey. Sidney sees this.SIDNEYHey.Sidney distracts the Ghost. She takes off, the Ghost
   following her. She moves around the tree, sprinting
   across the yard, running smack into...THE GHOST MASKED KILLERBut Sidney spins around as two Ghosts appear on each
   side of her. She stands THUNDERSTRUCK as the two
   Killers descend on her. She dives between the two but
   they counter, keeping her surrounded.Sid watches as one of the Ghosts withdraws his knife.
   She turns to the other. His knife is already poised.
   They close in on her, ready to strike.She looks for an escape. There's not one. BAM!Suddenly, Mickey appears, barreling into one of the
   Ghosts. They go sprawling across the grass.MICKEYRun, Sid...Sidney makes her break, she runs passed them, towards
   the front of the yard.Mickey leaps to his feat. The Killer right behind him.
   He now finds himself in Sid's predicament. He doesn't
   know where to run. The two Killer's close in on him.Sidney gets to the corner of the house. She stops...
   she doesn't want to leave Mickey. She turns back around
   just in time to see...Mickey sandwiched in between the two Ghosts. They're
   knives strike at the same time. One through the
   stomach, the other through the back. They withdraw
   their knives. Mickey's body suspends, momentarily
   hanging in the air. Then collapses to a heap on the
   ground.Both Ghosts turn to Sid at the same time. She takes off
   running, along the side of the house, through a row of
   shrub that take her to...EXT. STREET - SAMESid is back on the campus street, running down the
   middle of it.She spots a car stopped at a red light half a block up.
   KIDS are inside, rock music BLARES. Sid SCREAMS and
   SCREAMS but they don't hear her. She runs, feet
   pounding, toward them but the light turns green and the
   car takes off. It's taillights fading in the night.She turns finding herself alone in a parking lot. The
   theatre sits in the distance. She spots someone
   entering the theatre. It looks like Hallie.SIDNEYHallie?But Hallie doesn't hear her. Sid races forward.CUT TO:EXT. CAMPUS MINUTES LATERGale races down the empty campus street. She eyes an
   emergency phone that's attached to a street lamp. She
   goes for it.Gale rips the phone from its cradle, presses the CALL

   theatre door.GALESIDNEY!But Sidney has already disappeared inside. Gale yells
   into the phone.GALE (CONT'D)Fuckin' hurry.Gale throws the phone down and tears off for Sidney.INT. THEATRE SAMEThe theatre is big and old. Plush chairs, balcony, huge
   proscenium stage.Sidney enters through a side house door. She pulls on
   it, releasing the emeregency lock. She makes her way
   down the aisle toward the orchestra section.SIDNEYHello?The stage is dark and bare with the exceptions of the
   furniture from the DEATHTRAP set. BUMP! A noise from
   the stage wings.SIDNEY (CONT'D)Hallie?Sidney moves down front to the little bridge that
   extends out over the orchestra pit. She crosses it and
   moves to stage center, peering into the wings on either
   side of her.Complete darkness.DRIP! DRIP!Something drips down from above and onto Sidney. She
   wipes it from her face when...CLICK! A spot light turns on from the back of the
   house, illuminating Sid center stage. She jumps at
   this, unnerved. She looks to her hand, covered in
   crimson. Then out to the house... the light is
   blinding.CLANK! A NOISE from above..ropes, pulleys moving. Sid
   looks up as a set wall comes PLOWING down at her. She
   leaps out of the way, falling to the floor.The wall falls into place on the stage. It is the back
   wall of the set that's dressed with framed pictures and
   antique weapons and...DEWEYWho hangs from it, pinned up against the wall, very
   much deadk, arms outstretched, crucified. His body a
   bloody mess. Sidney stops, stunned. She stands frozen
   in unspeakable horror. Her entire being ripped apart.
   She breaks into tears. And then...Sid backs up, moving, racing toward the wings when
   another wall flies in, sealing the backstage area off,
   trapping her. She looks in shock at...HALLIEStrung up, her body hanging lifeless. Sid SCREAMS,
   turning, running to the other side of the stage when a
   third wall comes flying in, creating the three walled
   set of DEATHTRAP.Attached to it, is the body of Joel. Dead. Blood
   everywhere. And then, Sid hears...CLAPPING!A single pair of hands from somewhere in the house...
   applauding. She turns around and spots a FIGURE moving
   down the aisle. She can't make out who it is.Sid bolts. She spots the set door up center, near
   Dewey's body. She goes for it, ripping it open to
   find...COTTON WEARY STANDING IN THE DOORFRAMESid SCREAMS. But then sees his face, he looks scared.
   And then, Cotton's body falls forward to the floor, his
   arms and legs bound by electric tape.Sid turns back to the front of the stage. The Figure is
   now walking across the bridge, holding something... a
   light attached to a video camera. She's being filmed.
   Sid looks back to Cotton who looks up to her with
   pleading eyes.COTTONQuick, untie me.Sid is paniced. She doesn't know what to do. She leans
   down to untie him but stops.VOICE(from behind video

             serious trust issues right about

   where Hallie hangs.DEREK (CONT'D)Sidney, you can't keep your back to
             the audience like that. Could you
             cheat a little forward for me?COTTONPlease, Sidney.DEREKYou're really stumped, aren't you?
             You know there's two killers but

             yet the same because if you venture

             you.Gale's face is a mass of confusion.INT. STAGE SAMEDerek releases Sidney, shoving her, she falls to her
   knees, next to Cotton.CLOSE ON COTTON'S HANDSIDNEYOkay, look, you guys - I applaud
             your methodical expertise but I
             have a question. What's going to
             happen after I die? I thought the
             heroine is supposed to live.HALLIENot this time.Hallie moves in on her.DEREKYeah, we're trying to send a
             message to Hollywood. I'm really
             getting tired of all the happy
             endings. It's just not reality. In
             the real world the good guys die,
             the innocent are punished, and the
             murderers inherit the earth.SIDNEYBut nobody wants to see that. It'll
             never go. They'll rewrite you. You
             don't want that.HALLIEOh, Sid, you're sounding desparate.
             I guess fearing death makes one
             anxious.SIDNEYYou fucking freaked out movie nut
             psychos...VOICE(off camera)
             Don't blame the movies, Sid. Movies
             don't create pyschos.Sid stops dead in her tracks as these words still her
   very soul. The Voice comes from the wings. They all
   turn as Gale Weathers appears. Behind her, with gun in
   hand, is Debbie Salt. Derek grabs the camera. He
   doesn't want to miss a second.DEBBIE SALTDon't you know that by now? It's
             about family. It all starts at
             home. It starts with the father...
             and the mother.Sidney mouth drops, her face aghast, as she looks to
   Debbie Salt. She recognizes her immediately.SIDNEYMrs. Loomis?Gale stops cold.GALEWhat?SIDNEYOh my God.Gale turns to Debbie Salt.GALEJesus. It can't be.HALLIETold you we had a guest star.
             Didn't see that coming, did you?DEREKEverything's taken on a hyper-
             reality, hasn't it?GALEYou're Billy's mother?DEBBIE SALTI couldn't believe you didn't
             recognize me. You even interviewed
             me for your book.GALEYou're all in this together?DEREKWe had to have financing.HALLIETuition's expensive.SIDNEYWhy Mrs. Loomis?DEBBIE SALTWhere should we start? Your mother
             ruined my marriage by sleeping with
             my husband. You ruined my family by
             killing my son. Gale aired it to
             the world. Should I go on... isn't
             that enough?GALEJesus, you're just as whacked as
             your son.DEBBIE SALTWhere do you think he got it?
             Mental illness is heriditary. Who
             do you think incouraged him to kill
             your mother? He was a smart kid but
             children need parental guidance.Sidney is completely horror stricken. She stands in
   total disbelief.DEREKYeah, she's been great, Sid. We
             never would have been able to it
             without her.Debbie Salt/Mrs. Loomis looks to both Derek and Hallie,
   smiling.DEBBIE SALTAnd I couldn't have done it without
             you two. Now who won the coin toss?Hallie raises her hand.HALLIEI did.Debbie points the gun at her, quickly, simply... and
   FIRES. Sid and Gale SCREAM as a bullet through the
   forehead sends Hallie flying back against the flat
   wall. Her body drops to the floor. Dead.Derek drops the camera, completely taken back. He looks
   to Debbie.DEREKWhat are you...Debbie turns the gun on him. FIRES AGAIN. Derek moves,
   the bullet catches him in the stomach. He drops to his
   knees. Debbie FIRES again. Derek takes another bullet.
   This time dropping. Very dead. His body falls near
   Cotton who has remained suspiciously quiet through this
   ordeal. He eyes Derek's knife that now lay near his
   wrists.SIDNEY AND GALETurn to Debbie in complete horror.DEBBIE SALTNice kids but a little out there.GALEWhat are you going to do?DEBBIE SALTFinish what my son started.GALEBut you'll never get away with it.DEBBIE SALTEnter Cotton Weary.Cotton looks up.DEBBIE SALT (CONT'D)Think about it. An innocent man
             wrongly accused. Spends time in
             prison where he justs sits with his
             righteous anger, waiting, planning
             his revenge. His life so
             incomprehensively ruined he's
             forced to take revenge on the
             people responsible. It's perfect.COTTONNo... not again.DEBBIE SALTSorry, Cotton. I guess you were
             just meant to be a killer.SIDNEYYou'll never get away with this.Debbie moves to Cotton, shrugging.DEBBIE SALTWho would you like to shoot first,
             Cotton?Just then, Cotton leans up, freed from his bindings.
   With the knife in hand, he lunges for Debbie Salt. It
   strikes her, lodging into her chest. She goes back.
   Cotton doesn't stop, he stabs her again and again. She
   goes down. Dead.GALEThank God.Gale rushes to Cotton as he jumps to his feet. She
   helps him with the last of his bindings. Sid looks
   about at the body count on stage. It's mounting. She
   takes a deep breath. Relieved.GALE (CONT'D)God, Cotton, what a nightmare. I'm
             so sorry.COTTONYeah...Gale gives him a hug.CLOSE ON COTTON'S FACEGALEThank you.He hugs her back. She doesn't see as he rises the knife
   behind her, bringing it down in one swift, maniacal
   move. Gale's body jerks, a moment of shock and then she
   goes limp as the knife lodges in her back.Sidney turns just in time to see Cotton toss Gale's
   body down into the orchestra pit. He turns, facing
   Sidney. The bloody knife in hand.SIDNEYNOOO!Cotton moves to Derek's body where the video camera
   lay, he pulls the tape from it.COTTONIt's perfect, Sidney. No one will
             ever suspect me. I have proof. I'm
             the victim.SIDNEYPlease, Cotton, don't do this.He holds up the video cassette. Murder in his eye.COTTONI get my revenge and make some fast
             cash.SIDNEYIt's over, Cotton.COTTONNot until you're dead.Cotton lunges for her. Sid tears off, slipping through
   the set door to...BACKSTAGESid runs to the rear of the stage. She moves in the
   narrow space that exists between the scrim and the back
   wail. She races down it.She almost reaches the end when COTTON RIPS THROUGH THESCRIM!Sidney ducks, bypassing him. She comes to the stage
   door. It's locked. She turns, seeing the metal ladder
   that's attached to the wall. It leads to the catwalk
   above.Sid goes for it. She climbs up the ladder with
   lightning speed.Cotton, up and running, is close behind.INT. CATWALK SAMEThe catwalk sits above the open fly space where flats
   and a large chandelier are stored in the air.Sid reaches the top and takes off running down to the
   ending.AND THAT'S AS FAR AS I'VE GOTTEN.WHAT HAPPENS IS SID AND COTTON FIGHT TO THE FINISH, HECHASES HER THROUGH HANGING FLATS, THEN DOWN THE FLYRAIL, BACK TO THE STAGE. SID GETS FINDS A KNIFE ANDSTABS COTTON.HE STABS HER BACK. THEY FIGHT, CONTINUING TO STAB EACHOTHER UNTIL THEY BOTH DROP CENTER STAGE. THEY LAY NEXTTO EACH OTHER, NEITHER ABLE TO MOVE. THEIR EYES SLOWLYCLOSE.THE END (FOR NOW)
