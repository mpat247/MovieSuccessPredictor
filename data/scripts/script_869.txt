    typewriter. Someone reaching out to us. The bell dings,
    announcing the end of a line, and we see our title...THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWERMusic begins, picture fades up, and we are in the city.
    Downtown Pittsburgh. Looking out of the back window like a
    child in the back of a station wagon.

    We see lights on buildings and everything that makes us
    wonder. We see the bridge. And the river below. And then
    we enter...

    The Tunnel.

    We keep moving backwards, watching the lights. Golden,
    alive, and hypnotic. The music carries us as we float out of
    the tunnel. Onto another bridge. And over the highway.

    We move into the night sky, back through the trees, through a
    window, and into...2   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                  2It is a neat and tidy little room. Few posters or books.
    CHARLIE is 15. He is innocent, hopeful, awkward, and likable
    to everyone but his classmates. He sits at his desk, writing
    a letter in pencil as he tapes the title song through the
    radio on his cassette boom box.CHARLIE (V.O.)Dear Friend, I am writing to you because
               she said you listen and understand and
               didn't try to sleep with that person at
               that party even though you could have.
               Please don't try to figure out who she is
               because then you might figure out who I
               am, and I don't want you to do that. I
               just need to know that people like you
               exist. Like if you met me, you wouldn't
               think I was the weird kid who spent time
               in the hospital. And I wouldn't make you
               nervous.3   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER                            3Charlie anxiously walks through the hallway of his suburban
    split level house.2.CHARLIE (V.O.)I hope it's okay for me to think that.
              You see, I haven't really talked to
              anyone outside of my family all summer.

    Charlie moves to the living room where dad watches a football
    game. Mom reads a page turner and sips her white wine.
    Charlie waits for them to notice him. And waits. And waits.4   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                      4Charlie sits at his desk, continuing his letter in pencil.CHARLIE (V.O.)But tomorrow is my first day of high
              school ever, and I really need to turn
              things around this year.

              So, I have a plan.5   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - LAST DAY                      5We see it in Charlie's mind. Slow motion and wondrous. The
    kids clear out their lockers by throwing their old papers in
    the air like a New York confetti parade.CHARLIE (V.O.)As I enter the school for the first time,
              I will visualize what it will be like on
              the last day of my senior year.

    Charlie walks down the hall.   Triumphant.   Confident.   Happy.CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)Unfortunately, I counted, and that's...SMASH CUT TO:6   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - FIRST DAY                     6Reality. The bell rings, and we see the chaotic maze from
    Charlie's POV. A SENIOR BULLY leads the ritual, making
    dozens of freshmen hop down the hall.SENIOR BULLYHop, freshman toads. Hop!    Move it, boys!

    As seniors grab more victims, Charlie moves to the wall.CHARLIE (V.O.)... 1,385 days from now.

    At the front of the pack is BRAD HAYS (17), the quarterback.
    He's good looking, charismatic, and friendly. The big man on
    campus. Nice guy, too.BRAD HAYSWould you guys get a room?

    They laugh. Charlie turns to the trophy case to avoid them.

              Just 1,385 days.7   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - LUNCH                  7Charlie moves down the lunch line with his sister. CANDACE
    KELMECKIS is 17 and a beautiful type A, straight A priss.CHARLIE (V.O.)In the meantime, I'd hoped that my sister
              Candace and her boyfriend Derek would
              have let me eat lunch with their earth
              club.CANDACESeniors only.
                  (barks to Derek)
              What are you doing with a plastic spork?

    Candace turns to her boyfriend, DEREK, 17. Derek is such a
    pussy, the most masculine thing about him is his pony-tail.DEREKI don't want to bring back silverware--CANDACEDerek, you're Earth Club Treasurer.

    Derek takes the silverware like a beaten dog. Charlie
    watches them move into the intimidating cafeteria.8   INT. CAFETERIA - LATER                                           8Charlie sits in the corner alone, observing everyone having a
    great time with their friends. He sees a pretty girl with
    blonde hair having the best first day. This is SUSAN, 14.4.CHARLIE (V.O.)When my sister said no, I thought maybe
              my old friend Susan would want to have
              lunch with me.

    Charlie catches her eye and waves, but she looks away.CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)In middle school, Susan was very fun to
              be around, but now she doesn't like to
              say hi to me anymore.

    Charlie turns his attention to the quarterback, Brad Hays.CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)And then there's Brad Hays, who's the
              quarterback of our team. Before my
              brother went to play football for Penn
              State, he and Brad played together. So,
              I thought maybe he'd say hi to me. But
              Brad's a senior, and I'm me, so... who am
              I kidding?

    Brad catches Charlie staring at him.   Awkward.9   INT. SHOP CLASS - DAY                                           9Charlie sits by himself, watching the freshmen boys laugh as
    a senior paints a goatee on his face with a grease pencil.CHARLIE (V.O.)On the bright side, one senior decided to
              make fun of the teacher instead of the
              freshmen. He even drew on Mr. Callahan's
              legendary goatee with a grease pencil.

    Meet PATRICK (18), full of confidence, mischief, and so over
    high school. He is the class clown, performing a perfect
    imitation of the teacher, Mr. Callahan.PATRICKBoys, the prick punch is not a toy. I
              learned that in 'Nam back in '68.
              "Callahan," the sergeant said, "put down
              that prick punch and go kill some gooks."

    The laughter suddenly dies as the real MR. CALLAHAN (57)
    walks up behind the oblivious Patrick.PATRICK (CONT'D)But you know what happened? That prick
              punch killed my best friend in a Saigon
              whorehouse.5.Patrick suddenly feels Mr. Callahan behind him.   Oops.MR. CALLAHANI heard you were going to be in my class.
               Are you proud being a senior taking
               freshman shop, Patty-Cakes?PATRICKMy name is Patrick. You call me Patrick
               or you call me nothing.MR. CALLAHANOkay... Nothing.

     The class laughs. Except Charlie.   He watches Patrick take
     the long walk back to his seat.CHARLIE (V.O.)I felt really bad for Patrick. He wasn't
               saying the impersonation to be mean or
               anything. He was just trying to make us
               freshmen feel better.MR. CALLAHANEveryone open your safety guides.
               Nothing... why don't you read first?

               Oh, wow. This is useful guys. We should
               read on.

     Charlie smiles.   He loves him already.10   INT. ENGLISH CLASS - MORNING                                    10The kids pass back paperback copies of To Kill A Mockingbird.
     Charlie opens his Trapper Keeper, takes a pencil out of the
     plastic pouch, and writes... "ENGLISH CLASS... DAY ONE."CHARLIE (V.O.)My last class of the day is advanced
               English, and I'm excited to finally start
               learning with the smartest kids in the
               school...

     A SMART ASS FRESHMAN girl with braces smiles at him.6.SMART ASS FRESHMAN(whispers)
          Nice Trapper Keeper, faggot.

The kids around him laugh. Charlie's ears turn red. At the
blackboard, the teacher writes his name... Mr. Anderson. But
you can call him BILL (27). Bill is an idealist.BILLShhh. I'm Mr. Anderson. And thanks to
          Teach for America, I'm going to be your
          teacher for freshman English. This
          semester, we're going to be learning
          Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird.
          Genius book. Now, who wants to get out
          of the first pop quiz?

All hands go up.   Except Charlie's.   Bill paces the rows.BILL (CONT'D)I'm shocked. Alright. You can skip the
          quiz if you tell me which author invented
          the paperback book. Anyone?

As kids think, Bill confiscates contraband, removes hats.BILL (CONT'D)He's British. He also invented the
          serial. In fact, at the end of chapter 3
          of his first novel, he had a man hanging
          off a cliff by his fingernails. Hence,
          the term cliffhanger. Anybody?FRESHMAN GIRLShakespeare.BILLThat's a great guess, but no, Shakespeare
          didn't write novels. Anybody else?
              (off their silence)
          The author was...

Bill is about to give the answer when he notices Charlie has
already written... Charles Dickens.BILL (CONT'D)... Charles Dickens. However, if you and
          I had gone to a play in Shakespeare's
          time, it would have cost 4 pennies. Can
          you imagine that? We would have put
          those pennies in a metal box, which the
          ushers would lock in the office. And
          that's where we get the term... anyone?7.KIDS (O.S.)"Office Depot!" "Office Supplies!"

     Charlie writes down Box Office, then looks up to find that
     Bill is staring at him. Waiting for him to raise his hand.BILLI'll give you a free "A" on anything but
               the final term paper if you get it right.

     Charlie looks down.   He's not going to answer.BILL (CONT'D)Box office.

     The kids groan. They should have known.     Charlie smiles to
     himself. He's going to like this class.11   INT. ENGLISH CLASS - LATER                                      11The bell rings. The students chatter their way out of class.
     The last to leave is Charlie.BILLYou should learn to participate.

     Charlie stops and turns to find Bill erasing the board.BILL (CONT'D)Why didn't you raise your hand?
                   (off Charlie's shrug)
               They call you teacher's pet? Freak?
                   (off Charlie's nod)
               I used to get spaz. I mean, come on,
               spaz?

     Charlie smiles.   Bill takes a moment.   Then...BILL (CONT'D)So, I heard you had a tough time last
               year. But they say if you make one friend
               on your first day, you're doing okay.CHARLIEThank you, sir, but if my English teacher
               is the only friend I make today, that
               would be sort of depressing.BILLYeah.   I could see that.CHARLIEDon't worry, Mr. Anderson.     I'm okay.8.Bill nods and watches Charlie exit.   He gets swallowed up by
     the hallway as the bell rings.12   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                     12Charlie looks through the thick office glass. He sees
     Patrick use his charms on MRS. SMALL, (58) the Principal.PATRICK(to Mrs. Small)
               I would happily not take shop...

     Out of nowhere, the SENIOR BULLY grabs Charlie's book.SENIOR BULLYHey, Freshman Toad.

     The bully rips the cover. He throws it on the ground as his
     friends laugh and disappear down the hall. Charlie walks up
     and picks up his book.CHARLIE (V.O.)Well, I have 1,384 days to go. And just
               so I say it to someone, high school is
               even worse than middle school.13   EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DAY                                      13Charlie walks up the path to his house.CHARLIE (V.O.)If my parents ask me about it, I probably
               won't tell them the truth because I don't
               want them to worry that I might get bad
               again.14   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON                                14Charlie tapes his book cover back together. He looks up as
     his dad comes home from a long day. Charlie's mom hugs him.CHARLIE (V.O.)If my Aunt Helen were still here, I could
               talk to her. And I know she would
               understand how I am both happy and sad,
               and I'm still trying to figure out how
               that could be. I just hope I make a
               friend soon. Love always, Charlie.15   INT. CHARLIE'S DINING ROOM - EARLY EVENING                      15Charlie stands in the kitchen, pouring his milk.9.MOTHER (O.S.)Charlie, come on.

     His family is seated around the table.    Candace's boyfriend,
     Derek, is their special guest.DEREKMmmm. This chicken paprikash is
               delicious, Mrs. Kelmeckis.

     Charlie's father rolls his eyes, then reads his sports page.MOTHERThank you, Derek. It's Charlie's
               favorite. He was a little nervous about
               starting high school, so I made it.FATHERYou feel a little silly being nervous
               now, huh, champ?CHARLIEYes, sir.    I sure do.

     Charlie carries his milk back to the table.   He quickly sits,
     hoping someone will change the subject.FATHERI told you. Just give 'em a smile and be
               yourself. That's how you--CANDACE"--make friends in the real world."FATHERYou're cruisin' for a bruisin'.DEREKFreshman year is tough, but you really
               find yourself.FATHER(deep eye roll)

     Charlie passes by them with ice cream on his way downstairs.MOTHERI think you could be a little nicer to
               Derek.10.FATHERI'm sorry.     The kid's a pussy.   I can't
               stand him.

     Charlie moves to the entry hall. He looks through the screen
     door to the porch where Candace kisses Derek's cheek goodbye.
     As Derek walks to his mom's Mercedes, Candace joins Charlie.DEREK(waving from car)
               I hope you love the mix I made.     The
               cover is hand-painted.

     When he gets into his car, she hands Charlie the mix tape.CANDACECharlie, do you want this?CHARLIEAre you sure?CANDACEHe gives me one every week.17   INT. CHARLIE'S BED ROOM - DUSK                                      17Charlie sits on his bed, reading To Kill a Mockingbird, the
     cover taped back together. We see Derek's mix... Autumn
     Leaves... rotate in his old tape recorder.DEREK (V.O.)Hey, Babe. This next one might be a
               little sad, but it reminded me of your
               eyes.

     The first notes of The Smiths' "Asleep" begins.     As Morrissey
     sings, Charlie keeps reading. And reading.CUT TO:18   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - DAY                                        18The reading is done. Charlie proudly puts To Kill a
     Mockingbird on his newly dubbed "Shelf of Fame."19   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - AFTERNOON                   19The songs continues as we see glimpses of Charlie's day to
     day life over the next few weeks. Charlie exits his English
     class. FRESHMEN BULLIES wait for him, led by...SMART ASS FRESHMANDid you already do the term paper on To11.Silence. They grab and drag him into the boy's room.     We
     hear the toilet flush for the swirly.20   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - DUSK                                       20Charlie looks at the new bottle of prescription Wellbutrin.
     He puts a pill in his mouth and washes it down with RC cola.21   INT. CHARLIE'S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON                              21Charlie watches his brother and the Penn State Nittany Lions
     on TV. He looks over at his father, but his dad is too busy
     building Charlie's clock for shop class to notice him.22   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - LUNCH                     22Charlie carries his tray through the intimidating cafeteria.
     Not giving up. Looking for somewhere to sit.CUT TO:23   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - LUNCH                     23Charlie sits by himself in the corner. He looks around the
     cafeteria, wanting to break in. Not knowing how. After a
     moment, he returns to his book. The song ends.24   EXT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - FOOTBALL STADIUM - NIGHT              24Friday Night Football in Western, PA. Charlie buys his Coke
     and nachos and wanders to the bleachers. He sits alone,
     trying to blend in by cheering with the rest of students.
     When the Mill Grove Devils recover a fumble, he hears...PATRICKCome on Devils! Woooooo!

     Charlie looks up at Patrick, cheering his head off.    TWIN
     SENIOR GIRLS pass him, taunting.TWIN SENIOR GIRLSHey, Nothing. Hey, Nothing.PATRICKSuck it, virginity pledges!

     Charlie wants to go up to Patrick so badly. After driving
     himself crazy, sitting up and down twice, he approaches.CHARLIEHey... Patrick.12.PATRICKHey! You're in my shop class, right?
          How's your clock coming?CHARLIEMy dad's building it.PATRICKYeah. Mine looks like a boat.
              (off Charlie's awkward silence)
          You want to sit over here, or are you
          waiting for your friends?CHARLIENo.   I'll sit if that's okay.

Patrick motions for Charlie to sit.   Charlie sits.   Elated.PATRICKThanks for not calling me "Nothing" by
          the way. It's an endless nightmare. And
          these assholes actually think they're
          being original.

Brad Hays puts on his helmet and rushes onto the field.
Charlie dries his hands on his pants. So nervous. A 5
second silence that feels like a year. Think of something to
say. Anything.CHARLIESo, uh... you like football?PATRICKLove it.CHARLIEThen, maybe you know my broth--PATRICKHey, Sam.

Charlie looks up. Standing there is the prettiest girl he's
ever seen. SAM (17) would make every mother proud and every
father nervous. She is alive, adventurous, and a world class
flirt. Great attitude. Great taste. Great banter.SAMQuestion. Could the bathrooms here be
          more disgusting?PATRICKYes, they call it the men's room.13.Sam sits down, sandwiching Charlie between her and Patrick.
Charlie tries to remain casual. Hang in there, buddy.SAMWell, I finally got hold of Bob.PATRICKParty tonight?SAMNo. He's still trying to shag that
          waitress from the Olive Garden.PATRICKHe's never tossing that salad.

Brad Hays marches the Devils offense down the field. The
kids clap. Sam looks at Charlie, then turns back to Patrick.SAM(about Charlie)
          Patrick... who's this?PATRICKThis is...CHARLIEUh... Charlie... Kelmeckis.PATRICKKelmeckis! No shit! Your sister dates

          put the "ass" in "class," Patrick.PATRICKI try, Sam. I try.SAMIt's nice to meet you, Charlie.    I'm Sam.

Sam extends her hand to Charlie. Every nail a different
color. They shake. Then, Sam grabs a nacho. Zoinks!PATRICKSo, what's the plan, Sam? You want to go
          to Mary Elizabeth's house?14.SAMCan't. She got caught watering down her
               parent's brandy with iced tea. Let's
               just go to Kings.PATRICK(turns to Charlie)
               Hey... we're going to Kings after the

     Charlie nods just as Brad Hays tosses a touchdown pass.   The
     fans go crazy. Especially Patrick. Charlie smiles.25   INT. KINGS FAMILY RESTAURANT - NIGHT                             25The Devils' faithful cheer as Brad Hays and his guys enter!
     The place is packed. Patrick and Sam drink coffee while
     Charlie eats his brownie. They're all excited.SAMDo you have a favorite band?CHARLIEI think The Smiths are my favorite.SAMAre you kidding!? I love The Smiths!
               The best breakup band ever. What's your
               favorite song?CHARLIEAsleep. It's from Louder Than Bombs. I
               heard it on Pony Tail Derek's mix tape.PATRICKThat works on so many levels.CHARLIEI could make a copy for you.SAMThanks. What about Eide's?     You love
               Eide's, right?CHARLIE(never heard of it)
               Yeah. They're great.PATRICKNot a band, Charlie.SAMIt's an old record store downtown.15.PATRICKI used to be popular before Sam got me
          some good music. So, watch out, Charlie.
          She'll ruin your life forever.CHARLIEThat's okay.

Brad Hays, the quarterback, passes with his posse.       Taunting.NOSE TACKLE & LINEBACKERHey, Nothing. Hey, Nothing.PATRICKLet it go!     Jesus!   It's an old joke!
          It's over!

Sam laughs.   She loves watching Patrick get riled up.SAMSo, Charlie... what are you going to do
          when you get out of here?CHARLIEMy Aunt Helen said I should be a writer,
          but I don't know what I'd write about.SAMYou could write about us.PATRICKYeah. Call it Slut and The Falcon.      Make
          us solve crimes.

Sam laughs.   Charlie smiles.CHARLIEYou guys look happy together. How long
          have you been boyfriend and girlfriend?
              (off their laughs)
          What?SAMHe's my step-brother. My mom finally
          left my worthless dad and married his
          nice dad 3 years ago.PATRICKBut Sam's not bitter.     Make no mistake.SAMAbsolutely. I'm not a bulimic.      I'm a
          bulim-ist.16.They laugh at their inside joke.    Charlie has no idea what's
     so funny.CHARLIEI'm sorry.     I don't know what that means.PATRICKShe just really believes in bulimia.SAM(cracking up)
               I love bulimia.26   EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                      26Charlie hops out of Sam's old truck.    The music blares.PATRICKThanks for paying, Charlie.CHARLIE(so eager)
               No problem. Thanks for the ride. Hey...
               maybe I'll see you around in school?SAM(distracted - to Patrick)
               God, would you turn that down? You're
               going to make us deaf. Bye, Charlie.PATRICKBye, Charlie.CHARLIEOkay.   Bye.

     Charlie waves as the truck leaves. The look on his face.
     The happiness from one night of company.27   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                      27Charlie enters the house, excited to tell someone his news.
     He runs up the stairs to find the living room empty. He
     hears the TV playing downstairs in the basement.28   INT. DOORWAY TO BASEMENT - NIGHT                                  28As Charlie approaches, he hears muffled sounds of fighting.DEREK (O.S.)I'm sorry. I can't do anything about it.
               Please talk to me.17.CANDACE (O.S.)Maybe your mom and I should have a "drive
               us to our hair appointment" contest.
               Then, I could spend a Saturday with you.

     Charlie looks through a slit in the open door to find...DEREKThere's nothing I can do--CANDACEDo you always want to be a mama's boy?DEREKI am not a mama's boy--CANDACEYes! You are! Every time I go to your
               house--DEREKShhh.   Shut u--CANDACE-- your mom says, "Don't go to Columbia
               with Candace. Go to Pitt, Derek. Mommy
               needs you to stay at home because she
               can't drive herself." She's only 51.DEREKSHUT UP, CANDACE!29   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS                   29Charlie enters, wanting to stop the fight. Derek's neck is
     red. Dangerous angry. Candace keeps digging.CANDACEAnd you just stand there like a little
               bitch dog.

     SNAP! Out of nowhere, Derek slaps her across the face. It's
     not a movie slap. It's a real slap. Dead sound. And after
     it, silence. Candace turns and sees Charlie. It sobers her
     up. Charlie moves at Derek. Candace stops him.CANDACE (CONT'D)Charlie, just go. I can handle it.   Just
               don't wake up mom and dad.

     She pushes him out of the room and closes the door.18.30   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                       30Charlie sits at his desk. So disturbed. He hears a car
     start outside. He moves to his window and looks down at
     Derek and Candace near Derek's mother's Mercedes. Derek is
     crying. Candace comforts. After a beat... they kiss.

     Charlie stands frozen, a look creeping across his face.MOTHER (V.O.)Hey, look who's here...FLASHBACK TO:31   INT. ENTRY HALL - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                                  31The door opens to reveal Charlie's mom and AUNT HELEN
     entering the house. Aunt Helen carries a suitcase. The
     children don't know where she's been or why she looks sad.
     They just know they love her. Little Charlie stands at the
     top of the stairs with his brother and sister in their Sunday
     clothes. There are balloons. And streamers.LITTLE CANDACEWelcome home, Aunt Helen!AUNT HELENOh.   Look at you all, dressed so nice.

     Aunt Helen smiles at Little Charlie on top of the stairs.MATCH CUT TO:32   INT. ENTRY HALL - NIGHT (PRESENT)                                    32Charlie stands at the top of the stairs as Candace enters the
     house. She is startled when she sees Charlie. They whisper.CHARLIEWhat are you doing?CANDACELook, I egged him on. You saw it. He's
               never hit me before. I promise he'll
               never hit me again.

     She's about to go back downstairs when...CHARLIELike Aunt Helen's boyfriends?

     A silence passes between them.   Then...19.CANDACECharlie... this is Pony Tail Derek.   I
               can handle him. Will you trust me?
               Please, don't tell mom and dad.

     With a desperately confident nod, Candace goes downstairs.
     Charlie stands in the entry hall, troubled.33   INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT                                          33The Homecoming Dance is in full swing. God bless everyone.
     Especially Charlie. He's alone at the wall, dressed in his
     Sunday suit. To us, adorable. To himself, in living hell.

     Charlie watches his sister, slow dancing with Derek. As
     happy as she looks, Charlie still isn't sure if he did the
     right thing by keeping quiet. The song ends to applause.

     After a beat, Charlie turns away. That's when he sees Sam
     and Patrick at the punch bowl. We hear the first notes of
     "Come On, Eileen" by Dexy's Midnight Runners.SAMOh, my God. They're playing good music.PATRICKHoly shit. They are!   They're playing
               good music!SAM(total mischief)
               Living room routine?PATRICKLiving room routine!

     Charlie watches Sam and Patrick run to the center of the
     floor and show this stiff crowd what dancing is. It starts
     slow. "So over it" hand moves. A little shoulder. And
     then, the best of swing. 30 seconds of genius.

     Charlie takes a breath. Then, he tries desperately not to
     look like he's dancing toward them as he dances toward them.
     He bobs his head like a dork. And once he gets close,
     Patrick and Sam turn and find him.SAM & PATRICKHey!

     Without a pause, they grab his hands, and move together in a
     circle. Their own island. After a moment, Sam moves around
     Charlie like a maypole as the whole gym explodes into dance.20.34   EXT. BOB'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                         34The party rages inside this mansion in the rich part of town.
     Patrick and Sam walk up the steps with Charlie tailing.SAMGod, it's freezing.PATRICKBut you wore that toasty costume. It's
               not like you're trying too hard to be
               original.SAMPiss off, Tennessee Tuxedo.CHARLIEAre you sure it's okay that I come?SAMOf course. Just remember, Charlie...
               Bob's not paranoid.PATRICK"He's sensitive."

     Sam knocks. The door opens, revealing BOB (20). Bob was the
     cool high school kid, who never quite left. He's stoned so
     often that people can't tell the difference anymore.BOBSam... that waitress from the Olive
               Garden is a tease. Will you marry me?SAMOnly if I have Patrick's blessing.BOBPatrick?PATRICKYou're a hopeless stoner who attends the
               culinary institute. So, I'm going to
               have to say "no" on that one, but nice
               try. Charlie?

     Patrick leads Charlie inside, leaving Bob staring at Sam.BOBTouch�.35   INT. BOB'S BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER                              3521.PATRICKCharlie... this is a party.

The music blasts. Charlie's eyes are our guide. As they
walk through the crowd, you can smell it. Stale beer and
cigarette smoke. High school parties. The room is packed*with kids playing quarters. Others pouring vodka into a
watermelon.PATRICK (CONT'D)This is what fun looks like.

Patrick smiles when he spots two friends.PATRICK (CONT'D)You ready to meet some desperate women?

MARY ELIZABETH and ALICE (both 17) sit on the sofa together.
Mary Elizabeth is smart, a little overweight, and extremely
bossy. Alice will figure out that she's a lesbian in
college. Right now, she just likes movies and is Mary
Elizabeth's "beta female."PATRICK (CONT'D)Here, have a seat. Hey, ladies, meet
          Charlie. Charlie, meet ladies.

They shake hands and say their hellos.PATRICK (CONT'D)This is Charlie's first party ever. So,
          I expect nice, meaningful, heartfelt blow
          jobs from both of you.MARY ELIZABETHPatrick, you're such a dick.PATRICKWhere the hell did you go?MARY ELIZABETHThe dance was a little boring, don't you
          think?PATRICKYou're so selfish. We looked everywhere
          for you. You could have told someone.MARY ELIZABETHCry me a river.PATRICKHow is it that you got meaner since22.MARY ELIZABETHJust lucky I guess.PATRICKI think you're doing something wrong.MARY ELIZABETHOr something very right.

     Patrick and Mary Elizabeth laugh at their banter, just as Sam
     calls out from the other side of the room.SAM (O.S.)Hey!    Look who's here!

     The party turns, and Charlie sees Brad Hays, the quarterback,
     enter with Sam and Bob. Patrick approaches them. Charlie
     sits on the beat up couch next to the girls. He's shocked.CHARLIEIs that Brad Hays?ALICEYeah.    He comes here sometimes.CHARLIEBut he's a popular kid.MARY ELIZABETH(offended)
               Then, what are we?

     Charlie tries to think of something, but he can't.    The girls
     turn, ignoring him. Bob approaches with a tray.BOBCharlie, you look like you could use a
               brownie.CHARLIEThank you. I was so hungry at the dance.
               I was going to go to King's, but I didn't
               really have any time. Thanks.

     Bob smiles. Mary Elizabeth gives Alice a knowing glance.
     Charlie bites into the brownie. The icing gushing between
     his teeth. The image goes up into the smoke like an inhale
     as he chews and chews and chews.36   INT. BOB'S BASEMENT - LATER                                        36After a beat, the music changes, and the image exhales back
     down to Charlie, who is now... baked out of his mind. The23.whole party surrounds him now, pissing themselves with
laughter as this shy kid talks and talks and talks.CHARLIEHave you guys felt this carpet?     This
          carpet feels so darn good.MARY ELIZABETH(laughing)
          Charlie, what do you think about high
          school?CHARLIEHigh school? Bullshit. The cafeteria is
          called the Nutrition Center. And people
          wear their letter jackets even when it's
          98 degrees out. And why do they give out
          letters for marching band? That's not a
          sport, and we all know it.MARY ELIZABETHThis kid is crazy.

Charlie looks at Mary Elizabeth with her new wave haircut.CHARLIEAnd Mary Elizabeth, I think you're really
          going to regret that haircut when you
          look back at old photographs.
              (off their laughter)
          I'm really sorry. That sounded like a
          compliment in my head.MARY ELIZABETHOh, my God!ALICEWell, it's kind of true.MARY ELIZABETHShut up!

Sam enters the room.    Takes quick stock.   Then...SAMBob, did you get him stoned?BOBCome on, Sam. He likes it.     Just look at
          him.SAMHow do you feel, Charlie?24.CHARLIEI just really want a milkshake.

     The entire room explodes with laughter.    Charlie loves that
     people find him so funny.37   INT. BOB'S KITCHEN - NIGHT                                       37Sam takes the ice cream from the freezer to the blender.
     Charlie watches her make the perfect vanilla milkshake.CHARLIESam, you have such pretty brown eyes, the
               kind of pretty that deserves to make a
               big deal about itself. You know what I
               mean?SAMOkay, Charlie.     Let me make the milkshake.CHARLIEWhat a great word. Milkshake. It's like
               when you say your name over and over
               again in the mirror, and after awhile, it
               sounds crazy.SAMI'm guessing you've never been high
               before?CHARLIEMe? No. My best friend Michael. His
               dad was a big drinker. So, he hated all
               that stuff. Parties, too.SAMWell, where is Michael tonight?CHARLIEOh, he shot himself last May.

     Sam looks up.   Shocked silent.   Charlie is just stoned.CHARLIE (CONT'D)I kind of wish he'd left a note.    You
               know what I mean?
                   (off her sad nod)
               Where's the bathroom?SAMIt's up the stairs.CHARLIE25.Charlie wanders off.    Sam watches him go.38   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                             38Charlie leaves the bathroom and stops when he sees himself in
     a large ornate mirror in the hallway.CHARLIECharlie.     Charlie.   Weird.

     Charlie wanders down the hallway, a little lost. He finds
     the door to the master bedroom and opens it. He sees Patrick
     and Brad Hays... kissing.CHARLIE (CONT'D)Woah.PATRICKCharlie?BRAD HAYS(nervous)
               Who is that kid?PATRICKRelax. Relax. He's a friend of mine.
               Stay here.

     Patrick closes the bedroom door and follows Charlie.CHARLIEI didn't see anything.PATRICKI know you saw something, but it's okay.

     Patrick takes a quick peek to make sure no one is watching.PATRICK (CONT'D)Listen, Brad doesn't want anyone to
               know... wait, are you baked?CHARLIE"Like a cake." That's what Bob said.
               And how you can't have 3 on a match
               because they would find us. And everyone
               laughed, but I don't know what's funny.PATRICKOkay, Charlie, listen. I need you to
               promise that you're not going to say
               anything to anyone about me and Brad.
               This has to be our little secret.26.CHARLIEOur little secret.     Agreed.PATRICKThank you.     We'll talk later.CHARLIEI look forward to that big talk.

     Patrick laughs, goes back to the room, and closes the door.39   INT. BOB'S BASEMENT - NIGHT                                         39The party has thinned. Sam watches Charlie drink his
     milkshake obsessively with Alice and Mary Elizabeth.CHARLIEIsn't this the best milkshake, Alice?
               It's even better than the first one.

     Patrick walks downstairs.    Sam motions him over.SAM(barely audible whisper)
               I need to talk to you. Charlie just told
               me that his best friend shot himself. I
               don't think he has any friends.

     Patrick turns to look at Charlie. He feels so bad for the
     kid. Patrick raises his plastic cup to the remaining crowd.PATRICKEveryone.     Raise your glasses to Charlie.

     Charlie looks up.   A little paranoid.     Everyone is staring.CHARLIEWhat did I do?PATRICKYou didn't do anything. We just want to
               toast our new friend.
                   (off his look)
               You see things. And you understand.
               You're a wallflower.

     Charlie dries his sweaty hands on his pants.     He looks around
     the room at the nods and friendly faces.PATRICK (CONT'D)What is it? What's wrong?CHARLIE27.PATRICKWell, we didn't think there were any cool
               people left to meet. So, everyone...SAM & EVERYONETo Charlie.

     They all drink.    Sam approaches him.    A knowing smile.SAMWelcome to the island of misfit toys.

     Charlie smiles, and the soundtrack comes rushing up loud.SMASH CUT TO:40   EXT./INT. SAM'S TRUCK - NIGHT                                        40The truck speeds on Highway 376 toward the Fort Pitt Tunnel.
     Patrick drives. Sam cranks the radio, blaring "The Tunnel
     Song." The Star's anthem, "Your Ex-Lover is Dead" is our
     prototype for tone.SAMMy God.    What is this song!?PATRICKRight?    I have no idea.SAM(to Charlie)
               Have you heard it before?CHARLIENever.SAM(light bulb)
               Wait! Let's go through the tunnel!PATRICKSam, it's freezing.SAMPatrick, it's the perfect song!PATRICKNo.     Mama Patrick says no.SAMPatrick, it's Sam. It's Sam talking to
               you, I'm begging you to drive me--28.PATRICK(laughing)
                  Alright! I concede!

     Sam climbs through the window to the flat bed.   She grips the
     flood lights to steady herself as she stands.CHARLIEWhat is she doing?PATRICKDon't worry. She does it all the time.SAMTurn it up!PATRICKYou got it, your highness.

     Patrick turns up the volume and drums on the steering wheel,
     just as the truck flies into...THE TUNNELWe go behind the truck. Rising as Sam puts her arms in the
     air. The image moves to Charlie's point of view, rising from
     Sam's feet up her shivering legs. Past the band-aid on her
     right knee. To Sam's face as she looks down. Into the
     camera. Right at us. For we are now...

     Charlie, looking up at Sam, so in love with this free-spirit.
     So happy to have friends. Happy to be alive. Charlie gets
     this look on his face. Patrick notices and smiles.PATRICK (CONT'D)What?CHARLIEI feel infinite.

     The truck flies out of the Fort Pitt Tunnel onto the bridge.
     Patrick and Charlie laugh as Sam raises her arms. Free and
     young and alive on the greatest night of Charlie's life.CUT TO:41   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON                                41We see Charlie proudly put a Smiths poster on his wall next
     to photos of his new friends. He dances to his desk,
     listening to Air Supply's "All Out of Love" on his Walkman.29.CHARLIE (V.O.)Dear Friend, I'm sorry I haven't written
               for awhile, but I've been trying hard not
               to be a loser.

     As the lyrics begin, Charlie unabashedly lip-synchs...AIR SUPPLYI'm lying alone with my head on the
               phone, thinking of you 'til it hurts.

     Charlie sits at his desk, writing and lip-synching.CHARLIE (V.O.)For example, I am trying to participate
               by listening to Sam's collection of big
               rock ballads and thinking about love.
               Sam says they are kitschy and brilliant.
               I completely agree.42   INT. BILL'S CLASSROOM - MORNING                                  42As the students file out, Charlie hands his paper to Bill in
     exchange for a beat up copy of The Great Gatsby.CHARLIE (V.O.)I am also studying extra books outside of
               class. As it turns out, Mr. Anderson is
               a writer. He even had a play put up in
               New York once, which I think is very
               impressive. He and his wife might go
               back there after this year. I know this
               is selfish, but I really hope he doesn't.

     Charlie pauses in the doorway and turns back to look at Bill.43   INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH                                           43Charlie turns from the lunch line with The Great Gatsby on
     his tray. He looks at the gang at their table. He sits with
     them as they debate the design of this month's fanzine.CHARLIE (V.O.)My favorite time, though, is lunch because
               I get to see Sam and Patrick. We spend
               the time working on Mary Elizabeth's
               fanzine about music and The Rocky Horror
               Picture Show. It's called Punk Rocky.
               Mary Elizabeth is really interesting
               because she is a Buddhist and a punk, but
               somehow she always acts like my father at
               the end of a "long day."30.44   INT. LIBRARY - AFTERNOON                                         44The xerox spits out copies of PUNK ROCKY! Halloween Issue!
     Alice staples while Mary Elizabeth works her like a sled dog.CHARLIE (V.O.)Her best friend Alice loves vampires and
               wants to go to film school. She also
               steals jeans from the mall. I don't know
               why because her family is rich, but I'm
               trying not to be judgemental. Especially
               since I know how they were all there for
               Patrick last year. Patrick never likes
               to be serious, so it took me awhile to
               get what happened.

     Sam and Alice laugh when Patrick begins stapling Mary
     Elizabeth's fanzines to within an inch of their life.

     [Note: The following sequence will come from Charlie's POV of
     Patrick and Brad's activities over a weekend.]45   EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - NIGHT                                    45Brad Hays leads the football team through the banner onto the
     field as Charlie, Patrick, and Sam cheer. Moments later,
     Brad pulls his helmet on and rushes onto the field.CHARLIEWhen he was a junior, Patrick started
               seeing Brad on the weekends in secret. I
               guess it was hard, too, because Brad had
               to get drunk every time they fooled
               around.46   INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH                                           46Patrick whispers while the gang studies their SAT books.CHARLIE (V.O.)Then, Monday in school, Brad would say,
               "Man, I was so wasted. I don't remember
               a thing." This went on for 7 months.47   INT. ST. THOMAS MORE CATHOLIC CHURCH - MORNING                   47Charlie sits with his family in itchy church clothes. He
     turns to see Brad with his father and mother. Proper family.
     Brad's dad gives him a pat on the back.CHARLIE (V.O.)When they finally did it, Brad said he
               loved Patrick. Then, he started to cry.31.CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)saying his dad would kill him. And
               saying he was going to hell.48   INT. LIBRARY - DAY                                              48We see Patrick and Brad walking in the library. They reach
     the stacks, and just when it looks like they'll speak, they
     simply... PASS EACH OTHER WITHOUT A WORD.CHARLIE (V.O.)Patrick was eventually able to help Brad
               get sober. I asked Patrick if he felt
               sad that he had to keep it a secret, and
               he said no because at least now, Brad
               doesn't have to get drunk to love him.

     Brad sits down with his football pals. Patrick joins Charlie
     and Sam at their table. Charlie looks over at Sam, studying
     hard for her SAT's.CHARLIE (CONT'D)I think that I understand because I
               really like Sam. I asked my sister about
               her, and she said that when Sam was a
               freshman, the upper classmen used to get
               her drunk at parties. I guess she had a
               reputation. But I don't care. I'd hate
               for her to judge me based on what I used
               to be like.49   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - DUSK                                   49We see Charlie making a mix tape on his boom box.CHARLIE (V.O.)So, I've been making her a mix tape so
               she will know how I feel.

     The two cassettes run. The song is just about to finish
     when... the side runs out of tape and snaps off.CHARLIE (CONT'D)Ah, shit!50   EXT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - MIDNIGHT                 50The marquee announces it's time for the...51   INT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - MIDNIGHT                 51... Rocky Horror Picture Show! The ROCKY EMCEE, dressed as
     Riff Raff, whips the crowd into a frenzy.32.ROCKY EMCEE                           CROWDGimme an R! Gimme an O!           R-O-C-K-Y!   Rocky!   Rocky!
     Gimme a C! Gimme a K! Gimme       Rocky!
     a Y! What's that spell!?

     The crowd cheers!   Charlie claps from the front row.52   INT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - LATER                      52The movie is in full swing. Charlie watches Sam as Janet in
     the Floor Show. Sam mimics Susan Sarandon perfectly.
     Especially the body. She winks at Charlie as "Fanfare/Don't
     Dream It" begins and arriving regally as Frank 'n Furter in
     full drag is... Patrick.PATRICKWhatever happened to Fae Wray? That
               delicate, satin draped frame? As it clung
               to her thigh, how I started to cry 'cause
               I wanted to be dressed just the same.

     Patrick is a rock star. He approaches Charlie. Putting his
     ass in his face. Charlie is freaked out and laughing!
     Especially when he sees Brad, alone in the back, smiling.PATRICK (CONT'D)Give yourself over to absolute pleasure.
               Swim the warm waters of sins of the
               flesh. Erotic nightmares beyond any
               measure. And sensual daydreams to
               treasure forever. Can't you just see it?
               Woah oh oh!

     Charlie stops laughing when the orgy begins between Patrick,
     Mary Elizabeth (as Columbia), CRAIG (21), an art student with
     a model's body (as Rocky)... and of course... Sam. Charlie
     watches Sam until he can't take his lust (or guilt).53   INT. CRAIG'S LOFT APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT                     53We hear the chorus of "Don't Dream It, Be It" as Charlie
     watches all of the exciting cast members at the after-show
     party. Charlie sees a photo of Sam's naked back on the wall
     of Craig's loft. Very arty. Very black & white. Charlie's
     lust (and guilt) are now at 11. Alice looks at the photo.ALICEIt's gorgeous, Craig.    What did you use?

     Craig is impressive to high school kids. He's a little
     pretentious. But his art school life. His red wine. His
     loft. Wow. Right now, he holds court in the wine line.33.CRAIGColor film, but black and white paper for
               the printing. My professor gave me an
               "A," but for the wrong reasons. Most of
               them are idiots. You'll see what I mean
               when you get to college. How were your
               SAT's by the way?ALICE(worried)
               1150. I think I'll get into NYU.CRAIGYeah, I hope so.MARY ELIZABETH(cruel to Alice)
               1490. Harvard. Face!54   INT. CRAIG'S LOFT APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER                     54Charlie sees Sam alone on the loft steps. She looks a little
     down. He hands Sam a plastic cup and sits next to her.CHARLIEHey.    Are you okay?SAMYeah.   Yeah. But I got my SAT results
               back.   Oops.CHARLIEYou can take them again.SAMYeah, it's just if I'm going to Penn
               State main campus, I have to do much
               better. I wish I would have studied
               freshman year. I was a bit of a mess.CHARLIEI'll help you study for the next one.SAMWill you?CHARLIEYeah, of course.SAMThanks, Charlie.

     Charlie summons his courage.      He hands her the mix tape.34.SAM (CONT'D)What's this?CHARLIEJust a mix tape. No big deal. My
               parents have a pretty good stereo. It's
               all about that night in the tunnel. I
               couldn't find that song we were listening
               to, but I'm still searching for it, so--SAMIt's okay. These are great.   You have
               really good taste, Charlie.CHARLIEReally?SAMYeah. Way better than me as a freshman.
               I used to listen to the worst top 40.CHARLIENo.SAMYeah, I did. But then I heard this old
               song. Pearly Dew Drops Drop. And I
               thought someday I would be at a party in
               college or something. And I'd look up
               and see this person across the room. And
               from that moment, I'd know everything was
               going to be okay. You know what I mean?CHARLIE(devastated in love)
               Yeah.55   INT. CRAIG'S LOFT APARTMENT - LATER                              55The tape revolves in the stereo, playing a beautiful ballad.
     Charlie watches Sam sway to his music like a serenade. Like
     she is dancing with him. But she isn't. A wider angle
     reveals that she is slow dancing with... Craig.

     Charlie is 15 year old CRUSHED. No filter. Just feeling.
     Patrick, Alice, and Mary Elizabeth watch Sam across the room.ALICESo, what do you think?PATRICKI don't know.35.ALICEI hope it works out. Craig would be a
               big step up from her last boyfriend.MARY ELIZABETHNo, shit.     Who could forget Mr. Car Wash
               Loser?PATRICKI just hope she stops playing dumb with
               these guys. I keep telling her... don't
               make yourself small. You can't save
               anybody.

     Craig dips a smiling Sam as the song ends. Sam goes into the
     kitchen. Craig approaches Charlie. Turns off his mix tape.CRAIGMan, your mix is morbidly sad, kid. How
               about something a little more upbeat?

     Craig grabs a record from the pile and slaps it down.CRAIG (CONT'D)Sam tells me you want to be a writer.CHARLIEYeah.ALICEDon't you write poetry, Craig?CRAIGNo.     Poetry writes me.   You know?

     Charlie sighs. Craig's upbeat song begins to play. He
     dances over to Sam. Charlie's heart breaks as he watches Sam
     hug on Craig.56   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                     56In a mirror image, Candace hugs on Derek near the lockers.
     Charlie closes his own locker and moves down the hall.57   INT. ENGLISH CLASS - MORNING                                    57The bell rings.    Charlie sets down his On the Road paper.BILLWow.    That was fast.   You want another
               one?36.Charlie nods. Bill smiles and reaches into his desk. He
     hands Charlie a copy of A Separate Piece. Charlie takes the
     book and starts to walk out, but he turns back.CHARLIEMr. Anderson... can I ask you something?BILLYeah.CHARLIEWhy do nice people choose the wrong
               people to date?BILLAre we talking about anyone specific?

     Charlie nods. Bill looks straight at him. Not preaching.
     Coming from a history of personal experience and pain.BILL (CONT'D)We accept the love we think we deserve.CHARLIECan we make them know they deserve more?BILLWe can try.

     Charlie smiles.58   INT. KINGS FAMILY RESTAURANT - MORNING                         58Charlie waits nervously at a booth. He sees Sam enter. He
     fixes his hair, then pretends to read his SAT PREP BOOK.SAMHey, Charlie.CHARLIEHey, Sam. I didn't see you come in.     You
               want to work on probabilities and
               statistics?

     Sam nods. They open their books, and a Christmas song
     begins. In a quick passage of time, we see them study next
     to Halloween decorations. Then, Thanksgiving. And finally,
     Christmas decorations.59   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                   59The song continues. Charlie's mom and sister hang the

     loves getting their presents except Charlie - who got socks.61   INT. BILL'S CLASSROOM - MORNING                                 61Bill hands Charlie a well worn copy of The Catcher in the
     Rye. He smiles.BILLCharlie... this was my favorite book
               growing up. This is my copy, but I want

     an A on a piece of paper.MR. CALLAHAN (CONT'D)That's pretty good, Charlie.

     Mr. Callahan moves to Patrick's SHITTY WOODEN CLOCK. No

     seen in your life.MR. CALLAHAN (CONT'D)You've got to be kidding me.PATRICKIf you fail me, you get me next semester.

               Thank you, Charlie!

     They pass Mary Elizabeth as she opens her final present.39.MARY ELIZABETHMultiple pairs of blue jeans. Wow. This
          is a really tough one, but I'm going to
          have to guess... Alice.

Alice smiles. Bob nudges her. Guilty as charged.       Mary
Elizabeth pulls one last item out of the gift bag.MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D)Wait, guys... a receipt! She actually
          paid!PATRICKImpossible!MARY ELIZABETHI'm so touched.

Alice laughs. Patrick pours everyone brandy.    The kids look
ridiculous, but they don't feel ridiculous.CHARLIEWhere's Craig?SAMHe went home to Connecticut.    He'll be
          back for New Year's Eve.CHARLIEI'm sorry we won't be seeing him tonight.

Sam nods, then turns. Charlie is delighted. No Craig.         The
kids settle in the living room in front of the fire.SAMAlright, big brother by 3 weeks.    Who's
          your secret santa?PATRICKI'll tell you, Sam. This one's tough. I
          have received a harmonica, a magnetic
          poetry set, a book about Harvey Milk, and
          a mix with the song "Asleep" on it...
          twice.

Charlie starts snickering.    He can't help himself.PATRICK (CONT'D)I mean, I have no idea. This collection
          of presents is so gay that I think I must
          have given them to myself. But despite
          that distinct possibility, I'm going to
          have to go with... drum roll... Charlie.40.Charlie holds up his hands.     Yay!   They all cheer.SAMAlright, Charlie... it's your turn.

Charlie and Patrick switch places.       Charlie stands.CHARLIEOkay. Uh, I have received socks, pants,
          a shirt, and a belt. I was ordered to
          wear them all tonight. So, I'm guessing
          my secret santa is Mary Elizabeth.PATRICKHuh.   Now, why do you say that?CHARLIEI don't know. She bosses people around
          sometimes.

The gang cracks up.   Mary Elizabeth is pissed.MARY ELIZABETHWhat the hell is wrong with you?CHARLIESorry.PATRICKWell, you'll be surprised to know that
          your secret santa is actually... me.CHARLIEYou got me clothes?     Why?PATRICKBecause all the great writers used to
          wear great suits. Your last present is
          on a towel rack in the bathroom. Delve
          into our facilities. Emerge a star.

Charlie gives Sam a sack of presents.CHARLIECan you hand these out while I'm gone?MARY ELIZABETHWait a second. There's only secret santa
          presents. There are rules, Charlie.PATRICKMary Elizabeth, why are you trying to eat
          Christmas? Hand them out, Sam.41.Sam gives out the presents. The group rips them open. Alice
     looks at a book about Martin Scorsese with the inscription...ALICE"Alice, I know you'll get into NYU."

     Alice turns to Mary Elizabeth who holds up a card with...MARY ELIZABETH40 dollars.
                   (reads card)
               "To print Punk Rocky in color next time."

     Bob blows soap bubbles into the air.   Stoned.   Mesmerized.BOBHe knows me. He really knows me.

     Sam looks at her present. An old 45 record of The Beatles
     classic "Something" with a card. She reads the card. Holds
     it to her chest. Very moved.SAMCome on out, Charlie.

     They all chime in. "Let's go, young man!" "Charlie!
     Charlie!" Charlie opens the door off camera, and we see his
     entrance play off their faces. The reverse angle reveals...

     Charlie dressed in his suit. Like the best of English mods
     in the 60's. For those of you who know the book, this is the
     cover. They all clap. It's magic.PATRICKYeah!   What a display of man I have ever
               seen!

     Sam and Charlie look at each and smile.66   INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - LATER                                       66The door opens.   Sam and Charlie walk into the dark room.CHARLIEWhere are we going?SAMIt's a surprise.

     Sam flips the switch, bathing the room in light. Sam's room
     is so cool. A shrine to music. A xerox that says "The
     Beatings Will Continue Until Morale Improves." Virgin Mary
     icons. Snow globes. Kitsch.42.CHARLIEIs this your room?    It's so cool.SAMThanks.

Sam points to a green box with a red ribbon on her desk.CHARLIEYou got me a present?SAMWith all that help on my Penn State
          application? Of course I did. Open it.

Charlie lifts up the box to reveal an OLD MANUAL TYPEWRITER.CHARLIEI don't know what to say.SAMYou don't have to say anything.

Sam goes over and types. "Write about us sometime." He
smiles and types back. "I will." They look at each other.
We can hear a lovely ballad playing downstairs.SAM (CONT'D)I'm sorry we can't be here for your
          birthday.CHARLIEThat's okay. I'm just sorry you have to
          go back and visit your dad.SAMI'm in such a great mood, I don't think
          even he could ruin it. I feel like I'm
          finally doing good.CHARLIEYou are.SAMMe? What about you? When I met you, you
          were this scared freshman. And look at
          you in that suit. You're like a sexy
          English school boy. I saw Mary Elizabeth
          checking you out.CHARLIE(innocent laugh)
          No.43.SAMInnocent. Worst kind of guys. Never see
          you coming. And parents love you. That's
          like... extra danger.CHARLIEWell, it hasn't worked so far.SAMCome on. You've never had a girlfriend?
          Not even a 2nd grade valentine?

He shakes his head.SAM (CONT'D)Have you ever kissed a girl?CHARLIENo.   What about you?SAMHave I ever kissed a girl?CHARLIE(laughs)
          No! Your first kiss...

Sam gets this strange look in her eyes.    A little haunted.SAMMy first kiss? I was 11. His name was
          Robert. He would come over to the house
          all the time.CHARLIEWas he your first boyfriend?SAMHe was my dad's boss.

Charlie goes silent.SAM (CONT'D)You know Charlie, I used to sleep with
          guys who treated me like shit. And get
          wasted all the time. But now... I feel
          like I have a chance. I could even get

               that the first person who kisses you
               loves you. Okay?

     Charlie nods. And with that, Sam leans over and kisses him.
     It starts softly, then Sam wraps her thin arms around him.
     Holding on for lonely life. When the song crescendos, and
     they part, Charlie and Sam look at each other. Finally...SAM (CONT'D)I love you, Charlie.CHARLIEI love you, too.67   EXT. SAM AND PATRICK'S HOUSE - NIGHT                           67The porch lights are as golden as Charlie feels right now.

     Charlie. He fills a brown paper bag with    sand and a candle.
     He lights the candle, making the bag glow   like a beautiful
     lantern. He looks down his street, where    families are out
     with their kids, doing the same luminaria   ritual.MATCH CUT TO:72   EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                          72The same street. Christmas Eve. Many years ago. Aunt Helen

               and sister. I'll be right back.

     couple of candles and the blinking lights of the Christmas
     Tree. He's surrounded by leftovers. Charlie sits.CHARLIEHey.

     Chris chews and swallows.      Famished.   They both whisper.CHRISHey. God, I missed mom's cooking.        You
               have no idea how good you have it.       I'm

               Candace.    But I'm doing okay.CHARLIEOkay?    You're playing in a Bowl Game.

     changes his tone. Cautious.CHRISHow are you feeling, Charlie?CHARLIEGood.CHRISYou know what I mean.      Is it bad tonight?CHARLIENo.CHRISNo?CHARLIEI'm not picturing things anymore. And

     Christmas Mass. Charlie's father, then mother, then sister,
     take the sacrament. Charlie is next. The PRIEST makes the
     motion of the cross with the communion wafer. He places it
     in Charlie's hand. Charlie brings the sacrament to his mouth
     with his fingers...MATCH CUT TO:76   INT. BOB'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                    76We move in closer to Charlie's fingers in his mouth. When he
     takes his hand out, we see... a tab of LSD. The church organ
     is now a rock organ. And it's now... New Year's Eve.

     Charlie closes his mouth. He looks down the hall of the
     smoky room where Craig has his arm around Sam. Charlie turns
     to Mary Elizabeth, who's also dosed.CHARLIEHow long does this take to work?77   EXT. BOB'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                          77About 45 minutes. The sound is muted thick. Slight echoes.
     Charlie shovels the snow. Crunch. Fascinated by his breath
     making fog. Sam comes outside. She's worried about him.SAMShoveling snow, huh?CHARLIEI have to get this driveway clean. Then,
               I have to congratulate you for being
               happy because you deserve it.SAMYou said that an hour ago.CHARLIEWas that tonight? God. I was looking at

               ever talk to you?SAMAll the time. So, you want to put on
               these glasses? They'll protect you.

     Sam puts her arm around his shoulder. Protecting him.
     Charlie looks through the glasses. The sky bends like a
     globe. When he breathes, the sky ripples.78   INT. BOB'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                        78Charlie wanders through the party, tripping out of his mind.
     He sits down on the sofa. The world unbends as Charlie takes
     off the glasses. Kids walk around the party, leaving ghosts
     of themselves behind.

     Charlie looks upstairs to find... Sam and Craig kissing.
     Craig leads her to the bedroom.

                just blow it off because school dances

                tonight, but it was really nice, huh?CHARLIEYeah.MARY ELIZABETHI can't believe it. You of all people.
                I just can't believe you're my boyfriend.

      We land on Charlie's face.       "What?"   And then, we hear theGARAGE DOOR OPEN.MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D)Oh, shit!     My parents!

      The mad scramble for clothes begins.CUT TO:103   EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                          103Mary Elizabeth's car pulls in front of Charlie's house.
      Charlie gets out. Wanting to say he's not her boyfriend.
      Not knowing how. Mary Elizabeth smiles. Smitten.MARY ELIZABETHSee you Monday.

      With that, she backs out of the driveway. We see him from
      the back of her car, getting smaller and smaller. His
      stomach already filling with acid.CHARLIE (V.O.)Dear Friend... I'm sorry I haven't
                written for awhile, but things are a
                total disaster.59.104   INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH                                         104Sam, Patrick, and Alice are seated around the table. Mary
      Elizabeth has her arms around Charlie. Smothering him.MARY ELIZABETHWe're literally making out, and I'm in my
                bra. Hello! And the front door opens.
                It's my parents! I'm scrambling to get
                my dress on. It was crazy. Right, babe?

      Charlie nods, tortured.CHARLIE (V.O.)I probably should have been honest about
                how I didn't want to go out with Mary
                Elizabeth after Sadie's, but I really
                didn't want to hurt her feelings.105   EXT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING              105Ash Wednesday. Charlie gets out of the school bus to
      immediately find Mary Elizabeth waiting for him. She sees
      the cross of ashes on his forehead. She thinks his ashes are
      a smudge. She cleans it.CHARLIE (V.O.)You see, Mary Elizabeth is a really nice
                person underneath the part of her that
                hates everyone. And since I heard that
                having a girlfriend makes you happy, I
                tried hard to love her like I love Sam.MARY ELIZABETHCan you believe it's almost our two week
                anniversary?CHARLIEI know.106   EXT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT                   106A double date. Craig and Sam buy the tickets to see the

      Charlie tries not to feel Mary Elizabeth's sweaty hand.CHARLIE (V.O.)And I tried not to mind that she loves to
                hold hands even when her hands are
                sweaty.107   INT. MARY ELIZABETH'S DEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                   107Just like Sadie's except... the fire in the fireplace is out.
      We move from the fireplace to Charlie, touching Mary
      Elizabeth's breasts over her sweater.CHARLIE (V.O.)And I had to admit something really
                upsetting. But I am tired of touching
                her boobs. I thought maybe if she would
                just let me pick the make-out music once
                in awhile, we might have a chance.

      Charlie looks at the Ani DiFranco Mix on the stereo.   Sighs.108   INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH                                          108The gang is there.   Walden rests on Charlie's lunch tray.CHARLIE (V.O.)And maybe if she didn't put down the
                books that Mr. Anderson gives me.MARY ELIZABETHWalden? I read it in 7th grade.    I would

      clock. 3:13pm. His voice can no longer hide his quiet rage.CHARLIE (V.O.)Or if she would stop calling me the
                minute I get home from school when I have
                absolutely nothing to talk about other
                than the bus ride home...MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.)That dairy just sits with you. It walks
                with you.

                I became a vegan--CHARLIE (V.O.)I know I should have been honest, but I
                was getting so mad, it was starting to
                scare me.

      He looks back at the clock.   3:23pm.CHARLIE (CONT'D)Um... Mary Elizabeth. Can I talk to you--MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.)Charlie. Please, don't interrupt.        You
                know I hate that.

      Charlie goes to his quiet place.   Tick.   Tick.    Tick.CHARLIE (V.O.)I just wish I could have found another
                way to break up. In hindsight, I
                probably could not have picked a worse
                way to be honest with Mary Elizabeth.112   INT. CRAIG'S LOFT APARTMENT - NIGHT                              112Truth or dare. The gang is seated in a circle, drinking from

She kisses him. Charlie bites his cheeks.    Sam looks a
little depressed.CRAIG(to Sam)

           just wait-listed.PATRICKExcuse me, everyone, but you're missing
           some hot "fag on goth" action.

Anticipation. Patrick is getting ready to plant the biggest
kiss on Alice when she jumps him. Everyone groans. Ew!
Laughter. Patrick looks for the next person. Charlie's
heart pounds. Don't pick me! Please!PATRICK (CONT'D)Okay. My turn. Um... let's think...

                because let's face it... I'd smoke all
                you bitches.

      Alice hits him. Laughter. Charlie thinks. He looks at Mary
      Elizabeth, then turns to Sam. Before Sam can even react...
      Charlie plants a kiss right on her lips. When he opens his
      eyes, he looks around, and realizes the magnitude of his
      mistake. Everyone stares. After a horrible silence...PATRICK (CONT'D)Now that's fucked up.

      Without a word, Mary Elizabeth just stands, dignified, and
      goes into the kitchen.CHARLIEMary Elizabeth, I'm sorry.     I'm--

      Silence. Charlie looks over at Patrick, who wears a grave
      expression. It's going to be a long time. We hear the sound
      of the typewriter.114   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - MORNING                                    114Charlie sits at his desk. It looks like he's barely slept.

on her tail bone. Thud. Patrick gets hit a couple of times
in the face. The kids cheer the fight. It's getting louder
and louder with more and more noise. And then...SMASH CUT TO:Silence.

Charlie comes out from a blink. He calmly looks around. For
a moment, he doesn't understand where he is. He looks up.

his hand, clenched in a fist. It is already covered with...70.Charlie's confused until he sees the Linebacker holding his

                Miller?CHARLIEI don't know.73.PATRICKReally? I thought your brother would
          have told you. It's a classic.CHARLIEMaybe.PATRICKSo, Lily comes here with this guy Parker.
          And this was going to be the night they
          were going to lose their virginity. So,
          she did it really proper. She packed a
          picnic. Stole a bottle of wine.
          Everything was perfect, and they're just
          about to 'do it' when they realize they
          forgot the condoms. So, what do you
          think happened?CHARLIEI don't know.PATRICKThey did it with one of the sandwich
          bags.

They start laughing and screaming.CHARLIEEw!   That's disgusting!PATRICKYes! It is! Let's keep the train
          rolling. Suburban legends. Charlie!

Patrick points to Charlie, who thinks...CHARLIEUh. Well... there was this girl named
          Second Base Stace. She had boobs in the
          4th grade--PATRICKMosquito bites. Promising.     Go.CHARLIEAnd she let some of the boys feel them.PATRICKThat's your suburban legend?     Did you at
          least cop a feel?CHARLIENo.74.PATRICKOf course not. You went home, listened
          to "Asleep," wrote a poem about her self-
          esteem--CHARLIEFine!    Okay. Your turn.

Patrick walks over and sits down next to Charlie.PATRICKYeah, I've got one. Well, there was this
          one guy. Queer as a 3 dollar bill.
          Guy's father didn't know about his son.
          So, he comes down into the basement one
          night when he's supposed to be out of
          town. Catches his son with another boy.
          So, he starts beating him. But not like
          the slap kind. Like the real kind. And
          the boyfriend says, "Stop. You're
          killing him." And the son just yells
          "Get out." And eventually the boyfriend
          just did.

Patrick stops.    Gripped by sad.   He can't shake.PATRICK (CONT'D)Why can't you save anybody?CHARLIEI don't know.PATRICKForget it. I'm free now, right? I could
          meet the love of my life any second now.
          Things will be different now, and that's
          good. I just need to meet a good guy.CHARLIEYeah.

Patrick looks at him. Charlie has never seen him so
vulnerable. After a beat... Patrick kisses Charlie on the
mouth. Unsure of what to do, Charlie lets it happen. His
eyes open the whole time. A moment, then Patrick looks at
Charlie. He collapses into his chest.PATRICKI'm sorry.CHARLIEIt's alright.75.Charlie holds his friend as Patrick begins to cry. And we
      leave them, the city lights small in the distance.132   EXT. CITY HIGHWAY - NIGHT                                       132We see the truck glide down the highway.CHARLIE (V.O.)I've been spending a lot of time with

      Park. Patrick speaks, very animated, until...CHARLIE (V.O.)He always says he feels free, and tonight
                is his destiny. But after awhile, he
                runs out of things to keep himself numb.

      ... the words leave him, and we can see how sad he really is.134   INT. SAM AND PATRICK'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER                    134Patrick hands Sam an envelope.   Sam holds it.   Pins and
      needles.CHARLIE (V.O.)Then, Sam got her letter from Penn State.

      Sam opens the letter. She reads. Tears instantly well up in
      her eyes. She leaves the room and walks down the hall.
      Patrick picks up the letter.PATRICK(reading)
                "We will require you to take our summer
                session at the main campus immediately

                    (off Charlie's look)

                organizing the best senior prank ever.

      The shop teacher, Mr. Callahan stares at the wall, furious.
      As the students gawk, Charlie smiles to himself.137   INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH                                        137Sam and the girls chat excitedly.   Summer is almost here.CHARLIE (V.O.)Sam is going to leave right after
                graduation. It all feels very exciting;

                out in the cafeteria, it's been getting
                worse. And I can't turn it off this
                time.

      The class is buzzing loud.BILLGuys, you want to pass your copies of
                Gatsby up to the front please? And I
                know it's the last day, but if we could
                just keep it to a dull roar, I'd
                appreciate it.

      The class quiets down.77.BILL (CONT'D)Thank you for such a great year. I had a
                blast. I hope you did, too. And I hope
                you have a great time this summer on your
                vacations. Now, who here is going to be
                reading for pleasure this summer?

      Charlie looks to see if anyone is watching... then, decides
      to raise his hand anyway. Bill is proud.BILL (CONT'D)Very good, Charlie. Who else?

      Charlie looks at the Smart Ass Freshman who tormented him all
      year. She sighs. Nothing left to say to him.140   INT. BILL'S CLASSROOM - LATER                                   140The last kids exit the classroom. Charlie walks down the
      aisle and stands in front of Bill.BILLLast day.CHARLIEYeah. So, uh, I know it's none of my
                business, but have you decided... are you
                going to New York?BILLWell, my wife and I like it here, and I
                think I might be better at teaching than
                writing.

      Charlie is relieved.    Bill is staying.BILL (CONT'D)So, uh Charlie... I was thinking maybe I
                could still give you books next year.CHARLIEYeah.   Yeah.BILLI think you could write one of them one
                day.CHARLIE(fragile belief)
                Really?BILLI do.78.Charlie is quiet.   Then...CHARLIEYou're the best teacher I ever had.BILLThank you.

      He gives Bill a shy sideways hug. The two men say nothing
      else. Charlie waves and leaves. Bill smiles to himself.141   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - AFTERNOON                 141Times Square has nothing on these seniors. Charlie watches
      the gang on their last day of high school. When the clock
      hits 10 seconds to 3pm, all the students chant...SAM & COMPANY10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2...STUDENT (O.S.)Oh, my God, get me the hell out of here!ALL1!They all cheer and hug each other. Patrick loses his mind

      Running up the bleachers after the sun.CHARLIE (V.O.)Dear Friend... I wanted to tell you about
                us running. There was this beautiful
                sunset. And just a few hours before,
                everyone I love had their last day of
                high school ever. And I was happy
                because they were happy, even though I
                counted, and I have 1,095 days to go.143   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - FIREPLACE - LATE AFTERNOON                 143Prom night. Charlie sees Candace posing for Dad's camera.

      great. Charlie snaps pictures with Sam's mom and Patrick's
      dad. Mary Elizabeth is with her boyfriend, Peter. Alice
      stands with Patrick, dashing in his Mod Suit Tux.CHARLIE (V.O.)And then there was Sam...

      The image moves to the front of the house, where Sam emerges.
      She wears a vintage flapper dress from the 20's. Radiant.CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)I've looked at her pictures since that
                night. I like to see how happy she was
                before she knew.

      Sam joins Craig. They kiss for the cameras, then run with
      the rest of the gang to the limosine.CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)They were in a hotel suite after prom
                when the truth came out...

      The gang poses for more pictures in front of the limo.CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)Basically, Craig has been cheating on Sam
                the whole time. When I heard that, I
                kept thinking about the happy girl in
                these pictures. Because she doesn't have
                1,095 days to go.145   EXT. PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON                                    145Graduation Day. The place is packed with graduating seniors
      and families. Charlie's mom and dad fawn over Candace with
      the video camera. Charlie finally finds... Sam.CHARLIE (V.O.)She made it. This is her time. And no
                one should be able to take that away.

      They approach each other and hug.80.CHARLIE (CONT'D)Congratulations.PATRICKOh, Charlie's here! Guys, group photo!

      The kids line up for the picture they will always remember.PATRICK (CONT'D)Yeah, this is the one. That's going to
                 be a great angle.

      Hates You." The parents line up cameras. "Cheese!" Snap.SMASH CUT TO:146   INT. SAM AND PATRICK'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT               146The grandfather clock reads 9:30pm. The room is festive
      under streamers wishing Sam luck at Penn State. The kids
      sign each other's yearbooks. Charlie sees Sam smile at old
      photos. He misses her already.CHARLIE (V.O.)At her going away party, I wanted her to
                 know about that night we went through the
                 tunnel. And how for the first time, I
                 felt like I belonged somewhere.CUT TO:147   INT. SAM AND PATRICK'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - LATER               14710:28pm. Charlie doesn't know where the time keeps going.
      Sam opens goodbye presents from her friends.CHARLIE (V.O.)And tomorrow, she's leaving. So, I
                 wanted to give her a part of me.

      Charlie watches Sam pick up his present. She carefully peels
      the tape to reveal that Charlie gave her all of his books.SAMAre these all your books, Charlie?

      He nods.   They lock eyes and do not speak.81.148   INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                      148The pictures are down. The dressers empty. The suitcase is
      open on the bed. Charlie watches Sam fold clothes and put
      them in her suitcase. He has promised himself he will not
      cry. Even when she packs away his Beatles 45 of "Something."

      Instead, he looks at her and tries to remember every detail.
      Her hair and brown eyes and sound of her voice.SAMThanks for staying up with me.CHARLIESure. My brother said Penn State has a
                restaurant called Ye Olde College Diner.
                You have to get a grilled stickie on your
                first night. It's a tradition.SAMThat sounds like fun.CHARLIEYeah. Pretty soon, you'll have a whole
                new group of friends, and you won't even
                think about this place anymore.SAMYes, I will.

      Sam moves some suitcases over to the pile in the room.   They
      stand next to each other. Close.SAM (CONT'D)I had lunch with Craig today.CHARLIEYeah?SAMHe said he was sorry, and that I was
                right to break up with him. But I'm
                driving away, and I just felt so small.
                Just asking myself why do I and everyone
                I love pick people who treat us like
                we're nothing?CHARLIEWe accept the love we think we deserve.

      He says it sober. Without judgement. Sam lets it sink in.
      Charlie walks over to the bed to do more packing. Then, she
      turns to him.82.SAMThen, why didn't you ever ask me out?

Charlie didn't expect that.       He is silent.   Heart pounding.CHARLIEI, uh, I just didn't think you wanted
             that.SAMWell, what did you want?CHARLIEI just want you to be happy.SAMDon't you get it, Charlie? I can't feel
             that. It's really sweet and everything,
             but you can't just sit there and put
             everybody's lives ahead of yours and
             think that counts as love. I don't want
             to be somebody's crush. I want people to
             like the real me.CHARLIEI know who you are, Sam.

Sam waits.    And Charlie finally speaks from the heart.CHARLIE (CONT'D)I know I'm quiet, and I know I should
             speak more, but if you knew the things
             that were in my head most of the time,
             you'd know what it really meant. How
             much we are alike. And how we've been
             through the same things. And you're not
             small. You're beautiful.

He can't contain himself anymore. He moves to her and kisses
her. They stand. Move to the bed. Kissing. Charlie's
heart pounds. They sit on the bed. Still kissing.

We see her fingertips. Her hand on Charlie's knee. When she
touches him, Charlie pulls away from her. Shocked. Like
he's seen a ghost. It hits Charlie like freezing water.SAMWhat's wrong, Charlie?CHARLIEOh, ah... nothing.

Charlie shakes off whatever was bothering him and continues83.149   EXT. SAM AND PATRICK'S HOUSE - MORNING                          149It's like a dream for Charlie. He watches Sam hug Alice and

      They take a moment. And then they come together to hug. She
      kisses him goodbye, trying not to cry.

      After a moment, Sam climbs into the driver's seat of her
      truck with Patrick riding shotgun. Charlie looks dazed.SMASH CUT TO:152   INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                      152QUICK FLASH... Charlie remembers pulling away from Sam.

      The truck gets smaller in the distance until it turns at the
      stop sign. And disappears. Charlie stands there, alone.SMASH CUT TO:154   INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                          154QUICK FLASH... Charlie remembers the night with Sam. We see

      him in different planes of the image. He's beginning to

      He passes the photo wall on the stairs. We see the images of
      the family. Church. Communion. Baby pictures. Years of
      history staring at us. Ghosts on the wall.166   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - DAY (PRESENT)                           166BACK TO PRESENT. Charlie sits at his desk. We see him from
      behind. Perfectly still. Trying to keep himself calm.CHARLIEStop crying.86.167   INT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY (FLASHBACK)                           167QUICK FLASH. Charlie thinks everyone is staring at him. His
      sister and her friends. His brother and mother. Mary
      Elizabeth and Alice. And worst of all... Sam and Patrick the
      night they toasted him. A paranoid nightmare.168   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - DAY (PRESENT)                             168BACK TO PRESENT.   Charlie's falling to pieces.   The tears run
      down his face.CHARLIEStop crying.169   INT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - VARIOUS TIMES (FANTASY)                   169QUICK FLASH. Derek hits Candace.   Patrick hits Brad.    The
      cafeteria erupts into violence.

      And Charlie remembers what he's blacked out.

      We see him in the cafeteria. Terrifying. He thinks he sees
      Aunt Helen as he breaks the Linebacker's nose. Hits another
      in the throat. And pushes another. Charlie looks at his
      hand, covered in blood. The whole school staring at him.170   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - DAY (PRESENT)                             170BACK TO PRESENT. Charlie holds his head. Trying to stuff
      the pictures back in his brain. But he can't. They keep
      coming and coming, faster and faster. Sam's hand, Little
      Charlie on top of the stairs, the police telling him Aunt
      Helen is dead.CHARLIE (V.O.)It'll be our little secret.

      We go behind his head. The image moves closer and closer.
      Until it feels like we are inside Charlie's mind.SMASH CUT TO:171   EXT. HOUSE SWIMMING POOL - DAY                                     171We see Candace hanging out with her girlfriends at a friend's
      backyard pool. Her FRIEND (18, pretty) holds the cordless.CANDACE'S FRIENDCandace... your brother's on the phone.

      Candace casually picks up the phone.87.CANDACEHello.CHARLIE (V.O.)Hey, Candace.CANDACECharlie?CHARLIESam and Patrick left, and um, I just
                   can't stop thinking something.CANDACEWhat?CHARLIECandace, I killed Aunt Helen, didn't I?
                   She died getting my birthday present, so
                   I guess I killed her, right? I've tried
                   to stop thinking that, but I can't. She
                   keeps driving away and dying over and
                   over.

      Candace looks like she got hit with ice water. She knows her
      brother. She knows this voice. Candace covers the phone.CANDACECall the police and send them to my
                   house.CHARLIEAnd I can't stop her.   I'm crazy again.CANDACENo, Charlie, listen to me. Mom and dad
                   are going to be home with Chris any
                   second.CHARLIEI was just thinking... what if I wanted
                   her to die, Candace?CANDACEWhat?    Charlie... Charlie!

      Dial tone.172   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DAY                                     172We begin in the house. It's silent. The hallway. The entry
      hall. The empty bedroom. Charlie's typewriter on his desk.88.It's all so quiet. And then, we see Charlie walking down the
      hallway. He turns the corner and enters the...MATCH CUT TO:173   INT. CHARLIE'S KITCHEN - DAY (PAST AND PRESENT)                     173Kitchen.   One room. Charlie doesn't know where he is
      anymore.   The past and present have bled together.

      QUICK FLASH. We see Little Charlie turn the corner into the
      kitchen. BACK TO PRESENT as 16 year old Charlie stands in
      the same kitchen, breathing shallow.

      QUICK FLASH. 7 year old Charlie walks up to Aunt Helen
      sitting at the kitchen table. BACK TO PRESENT as 16 year old
      Charlie begins to have a full blown anxiety attack.

      QUICK FLASH. 7 year old Charlie takes Aunt Helen's hand and
      turns it over... to reveal her wrist scars.

      BACK TO PRESENT as Charlie looks from the table to the
      counter with the bread and the KNIVES. He stares at the
      knives for a moment. Just as...

      The Policemen break down the door.SMASH CUT TO:174   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT                                          174We see Charlie's reflection in the window. The door opens
      slowly, and his psychiatrist, Dr. Burton, enters. She finds
      him sitting in the corner. He has been crying.DR. BURTONCharlie?   I'm Dr. Burton.CHARLIEWhere am I?DR. BURTONMayview hospital.

      This news hits Charlie hard.   He begins to panic.CHARLIEYou have to let me go.    My dad can't
                 afford it.DR. BURTONDon't worry about that.89.CHARLIENo. I saw them when I was little. And I
          don't want to be a Mayview kid. Just
          tell me how to stop it.DR. BURTONStop what?CHARLIESeeing it. All their lives. All the
          time. Just... how do you stop seeing it?DR. BURTONSeeing what, Charlie?

Charlie breaks.CHARLIEThere is so much pain.    And I don't know
          how to not notice it.DR. BURTONWhat's hurting you?CHARLIENo! Not me. It's them. It's everyone.
          It never stops. Do you understand?

Dr. Burton smiles, sympathetic. Charlie nods, relieved that
someone finally understands. Until...DR. BURTONWhat about your Aunt Helen?

Like cold water. What was tears is now confusion and soon to
be shame. Dr. Burton is gentle to him.CHARLIEWhat about her?DR. BURTONCan you see her?CHARLIEYes, she had a terrible life.   But... I
          mean, what am I...DR. BURTONYou said some things about her in your
          sleep.CHARLIEI don't care.90.DR. BURTONIf you want to get better, you have to--

      Charlie looks at her, nodding her encouragement.CHARLIEShe was... insane.

      The minute he says one word of truth, he feels ashamed. He
      stops talking. Dr. Burton does not press him. Not today.DR. BURTONCharlie, are you going to let me help you
                here?

      Charlie cries and nods.CHARLIEOkay.DR. BURTONDo you remember anything before you
                blacked out?CHARLIEI, uh... I remember leaving Sam's house,
                and walking home...

      We move away from them as Charlie's voice trails off.175   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING                                      175The sun creeps through the windows. We can hear birds
      outside. The intercom is quiet. Charlie is alone. He looks
      at Sam's typewriter. "Dear Friend" is already typed.CHARLIE (V.O.)I was in the hospital for awhile. I won't
                go into detail about all of it. But I
                will say there were some very bad days.
                And some unexpected beautiful days.

      Charlie picks up a get well card from Sam.176   INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY                                       176Dr. Burton walks Charlie's parents down the hallway.CHARLIE (V.O.)The worst day was the time my doctor told
                my mom and dad what Aunt Helen did to me.

      In the distance, we see Charlie's mom and dad stop.    Shocked.91.177   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY                                       177Charlie looks up and sees his mom and dad in the doorway.MOTHERHoney?

      His mother comes to hold him.MOTHER (CONT'D)I'm so sorry.

      For a second, we see the emotion his father hides behind the
      sports page, before he chokes it down. He walks over to his
      son and kisses his forehead.178   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING                                   178Charlie, Chris, and Candace sit on the bed, playing cards.CHARLIE (V.O.)The best days were those when I could
                have visitors. My brother and sister
                always came for those until Chris had to
                go to training camp. He's going to be
                first string this year. And my sister
                told me she met a nice guy at her summer
                job.179   INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - AFTERNOON                              179Charlie leaves his room with his suitcase in hand.    His
      mother waits in the hallway with Dr. Burton.DR. BURTONThere he is. So, I'll see you Thursday
                at 6, right?

      Charlie nods and leaves the hospital with his mother.CHARLIE (V.O.)My doctor said we can't choose where we
                can come from, but we can choose where we
                go from there. I know it's not all the
                answers, but it was enough to start
                putting these pieces together.

      Dr. Burton smiles, then turns back into the hospital.180   INT. CHARLIE'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT                             180The family sits at the dinner table.92.FATHERGod bless this food that we are about to
                   receive. We thank You for this bounty in
                   the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

      After they say "Amen," the room falls silent. The family is
      on pins and needles. No one touches their food. Until...CHARLIEHow do you think the Penguins are going
                   to do this year, dad?FATHERGod damn Penguins. I think they're
                   allergic to God damn defense.CHARLIEWhat do the players call a puck again?FATHERA biscuit.CANDACEAre you sure it's not a "God damn
                   biscuit?"FATHERYou're cruisin' for a bruisin'.

      As things return to normal, dad picks up his paper. Candace
      talks about the books she'll need for college. Everyone
      starts eating. And Charlie smiles, happy to just be home.181   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DUSK                                   181Ding dong.    The door opens to reveal Patrick, smiling.PATRICKCan Charlie come out and play?

      Charlie's mother smiles. Charlie smiles, too. Especially
      when he sees... Sam. Standing next to Patrick. Her hair a
      little different. Her eyes alive and happy.182   INT. KINGS FAMILY RESTAURANT - NIGHT                          182The gang of three sit at their booth. Sam and Patrick have
      their coffee. Charlie has his brownie. Like always.SAMThat first night, I had grilled stickies.
                   It was so good. You have to visit in the
                   Fall. We'll have some. Okay?93.CHARLIEDefinitely.PATRICKSorry, Sam. Charlie has a breakdown
                scheduled for October.

      Charlie laughs.   Sam smiles.   After a beat...SAMWell, can I tell you something? I've
                been away for two months. It's another
                world. And it gets better.
                    (off Charlie's smile)
                And my roommate Katie has the best taste
                in music.

      Sam puts a cassette tape down on the table.SAM (CONT'D)I found the tunnel song.

      Charlie looks at Sam and Patrick, who smile.SAM (CONT'D)Let's drive.183   EXT. KINGS FAMILY RESTAURANT - NIGHT                            183The three leave the restaurant and jump into Sam's truck.
      Patrick drives. Charlie in the middle. Sam the passenger.CHARLIE (V.O.)I don't know if I will have the time to
                write any more letters because I might be
                too busy trying to participate. So, if
                this does end up being the last letter, I
                just want you to know that I was in a bad
                place before I started high school. And
                you helped me.184   INT. SAM'S TRUCK - NIGHT                                        184The three friends are flying down the highway in Sam's truck.
      The music blaring. The wind making their hair dance.CHARLIE (V.O.)Even if you didn't know what I was
                talking about. Or know someone who's
                gone through it. It made me not feel
                alone.

      With Sam's help, Charlie climbs through the little window94.185   EXT. HIGHWAY 376 NORTH - NIGHT                                   185Charlie gets into the back of the truck. He sits down,
      looking back at the highway. Watching everywhere he's been.CHARLIE (V.O.)Because I know there are people who say
                all of these things don't happen. And
                there are people who forget what it's
                like to be 16 when they turn 17.

      We see Charlie in profile.   The night sky behind him until...186   INT. FORT PITT TUNNEL - NIGHT                                    186... they enter the tunnel, and we realize just how fast
      they're driving. The white tiles of the tunnel whiz by at
      blinding speed. A perfect night. A perfect drive. Flying.CHARLIE (V.O.)I know these will all be stories someday.
                And our pictures will become old
                photographs. And we'll all become
                somebody's mom or dad. But right now,
                these moments are not stories.

      Charlie turns to face forward. To the moment.   To Sam,
      smiling at him from the front seat.CHARLIE (V.O) (CONT'D)This is happening. I am here. And I am
                looking at her. And she is so beautiful.

      Sam kisses Charlie. Then, she turns, and all three kids look
      ahead to everything in front of them. Charlie begins to
      stand in the back of the truck. Ready to leave the tunnel.CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)I can see it. This one moment when you
                know you're not a sad story. You are
                alive. And as you stand up and see the
                lights on buildings and everything that
                makes you wonder. And you are listening
                to that song on that drive with the
                people you love most in this world.

      Charlie stands in the back of the truck.   The wind on his
      face. He is free.CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)And in this moment, I swear...95.We see the moment as Charlie sees it. The tunnel's exit
getting bigger and brighter with the lights of the city
behind it.CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)... we are infinite.

The tunnel song blasts over the speakers as the truck flies
out of the tunnel. Sam and Patrick scream with excitement.
Charlie holds his arms in the air. The weight of the world
gone. If only for a moment. This one moment. We see the
city. A million lights like white stars in a glass dome. We
crane to the sky. We are in Heaven.FADE OUT.
