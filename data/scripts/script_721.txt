                         naive about all of this that I suspect 
                         there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence 
                         somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did 
                         it all start?CHANGThat, my dear Conway, is the story of 
                         a remarkable man.CONWAYWho?CHANGA Belgian priest by the name of Father 
                         Perrault, the first European to find 
                         this place, and a very great man indeed. 
                         He is responsible for everything you 
                         see here. He built Shangri-La, taught 
                         our natives, and began our collection 
                         of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father 
                         Perrault.CONWAYWhen was all this?CHANGOh, let me see - way back in 1713, I 
                         think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled 
                         into the Valley, half frozen to death. 
                         It was typical of the man that, one 
                         leg being frozen, and of course there 
                         being no doctors here, he amputated 
                         the leg himself.CONWAY(shocked)He amputated his own leg?? 519 ?CHANGYes. Oddly enough, later, when he had 
                         learned to understand their language, 
                         the natives told him he could have saved 
                         his leg. It would have healed without 
                         amputation.CONWAYWell, they didn't actually mean that.CHANGYes, yes. They were very sincere about 
                         it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect 
                         health is the rule here. They've never 
                         known anything different. So what was 
                         true for them they thought would naturally 
                         be true for anyone else living here.CONWAYWell, is it?CHANGRather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly 
                         so in the case of Father Perrault himself. 
                         Do you know when he and the natives 
                         were finished building Shangri-La, he 
                         was 108 years old and still very active, 
                         in spite of only having one leg?CONWAY108 and still active?CHANGYou're startled?CONWAYOh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's 
                         all.CHANGForgive me. I should have told you it 
                         is quite common here to live to a very 
                         ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain 
                         water, you might say. But we like to 
                         believe it is the absence of struggle 
                         in the way we live. In your countries, 
                         on the other hand, how often do you 
                         hear the expression, "He worried himself 
                         to death?" or, "This thing or that killed 
                         him?"CONWAYVery often.CHANGAnd very true. Your lives are therefore, 
                         as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural 
                         death as by indirect suicide.CONWAY(after a pause)That's all very fine if it works out. 
                         A little amazing, of course.? 520 ?CHANGWhy, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!CONWAYI surprise you? Now that's news.CHANGI mean, your amazement. I could have 
                         understood it in any of your companions,

                         me in a vision, long, long, ago. I saw 
                         all the nations strengthening, not in 
                         wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and 
                         the will to destroy. I saw their machine 
                         power multiply until a single weaponed 
                         man might match a whole army. I foresaw 
                         a time when man, exulting in the technique 
                         of murder, would rage so hotly over 
                         the world that every book, every treasure, 
                         would be doomed to destruction. This 
                         vision was so vivid and so moving that 
                         I determined to gather together all 
                         the things of beauty and culture that 
                         I could and preserve them here against

                         more pitiful? What madness there is, 
                         what blindness, what unintelligent leadership!

                         this orgy will spend itself, when brutality 
                         and the lust for power must perish by 
                         its own sword. Against that time is 
                         why I avoided death and am here, and 
                         why you were brought here. For when 
                         that day comes, the world must begin 
                         to look for a new life. And it is our
