               When you turn ten, your head's going
               to swell up real big like a watermelon
               and we're going to have to put you

     through the house. A TENSE STRAIN OF MUSIC FADES UP.TODDWhat's that?KIMBERLYWait! Hold still!TODDWhat?!KIMBERLYYou heads starting to swell up!!

     Todd screams. We hear the sound of Tom's footsteps running
     through the kitchen, down the hall, up the stairs, up the
     hallway. A door open.TOM(breathless)
               What's the matter?JOYCE(worried)
               It's Ferris!TOMWhat's wrong?JOYCE(snaps)
               What's wrong? For Christ's sake!
               Look at him!2  CLOSE-UP. FERRIS                                              2An eighteen year-old boy. He's staring lifelessly at CAMERA.
     His mouth's open. His eyes are bugged-out. His tongue is fat
     and dry in his mouth. He's laying in bed, on his side.3  INT. BOY'S BEDROOM                                            3Ferris' parents, TOM and JOYCE BUELLER are standing at
     bedside. They're in their late forties, early fifties.
     Handsome, upper-middle class parents. They're both dressed
     for work.TOMFerris?JOYCEHe doesn't have a fever. But he says
               his stomach hurts and he's seeing spots.4  CLOSE-UP. FERRIS                                              4His lifeless eyes blink.5  INT. BEDROOM. PARENTS                                         5Tom bends down and touches Ferris' forehead.TOMWhat's the matter, Ferris?JOYCEFeel his hands. They're cold and clammy.

     Tom takes one of Ferris' hands.TOM(discreetly)
               Should you call the doctor?JOYCE(whispers)
               He doesn't want me to.TOMWhy don't you want Mom to call
               the doctor?

     Ferris exhales loudly. He tries to speak but all he can
     manage is a choked gasp.TOMWhat?

     Ferris tries again.FERRIS(raspy)
               Don't make a fuss. I'm fine. I'll get up.

     He starts to get up. Joyce gently pushes him back down.FERRISI have a test today. I have to take it.
               I want to get into a good college
               so I can have a fruitful life...JOYCEYou're not going to school like
               this.
                          (to Tom)
               Maybe I should call the office and
               tell them I won't be in.FERRISI'm okay, Mom. I feel perfectly...Oh, God!

     He's gripped by a seizure. His body stiffens and he chokes.
     His older sister, JEANIE, walks into the room. She's dressed
     for school. She's cute and stuck-up. A major pill.JEANOh, fine. What's this? What's his problem?JOYCEHe doesn't feel well.JEANYeah, right. Dry that one out
               and you can fertilize the lawn.TOMThat's enough, Jeanie.JEANIEYou're not falling for this, are you?
               Tell me you're not falling for this.FERRISIs that Jeanie? I can't see that
               far. Jeanie?JEANIEPucker up and squat, Ferris.JOYCE(annoyed)
               Thank you, Jeanie. Get to school.JEANIE(angry, defeated)
               You're really letting him stay home?
               I can't believe this. If I was bleeding
               out my eyes, you guys'd make me go to
               school. It's so unfair.FERRISPlease don't be upset with me, Jeanie.
               Be thankful that you're fit and have
               your health. Cherish it.JEANIE(to herself)
               Oh, I wanna puke.

     She glares at Ferris. Her eyes are mascara and vengence. She
     slips out of the room. Ferris' brother, TODD and sister,
     KIMBERLY peek into the room.KIMBERLYMyocardial infarction?JOYCEGet your stuff. Daddy'll be right
               down.KIMBERLYSyphilitic meningitus? That would be
               a huge family embarrassment.TOMGet downstairs!KIMBERLYIf he dies, I got dibs on his stereo.

     She turns sharply and exits.TODD(worried)
               Dad? Does my head look alright?JOYCEGet downstairs! Now!TODDJust answer me one question! Is it
               swelling up? Kim said it was going
               to get as big as...KIMBERLY (OC)A WATERMELON!TODD(yells out the room)
               Shut-up!JOYCEGet downstairs! NOW!

     Todd backs out of the room.FERRISI'll be okay. I'll just sleep.
               Maybe I'll have an aspirin around
               noon.JOYCE(to Ferris)
               I'm showing houses to the family
               from California today but I'll be in
               the area. My office'll know where
               I am, if you need me.TOMI'll check it with you, too.FERRISIt's nice to know I have such
               loving, caring parents. You're
               both very special people.6  CU. FERRIS                                                    6He acknowledges Tom with a pathetic flutter of his eyelids.7  INT. BEDROOM. JOYCE                                           7She strokes Ferris' hair.JOYCEI hope you feel better, pumpkin.

     She leans down and kisses his forehead. Tom pats his
     shoulder.TOMGet some rest.8  CU. FERRIS                                                    8Ferris lets out a wheeze. His glassy eyes follow his parents
     to the door.JOYCE (OC)We love you, sweetie.TOM (OC)Call if you need us.

     They close the door. The lock clicks. Ferris' eyes shift
     from the door to CAMERA. A sly, little smile crawls across
     his lips.FERRISThey bought it.

     The MTV theme music ROARS IN.9  CU. TV SCREEN                                                 9The TV at the foot of Ferris' bed. The MTV logo is playing.10  INT. BEDROOM                                                 10Ferris yanks open the drapes. The pall of the sickroom
     disappears in the brilliant glow of morning sunlight.FERRISIncredible! One of the worst performances
               of my career and they never doubted it
               for a second.
                          (looks out the window)
               What a beautiful day!

     He turns from the window.FERRISParents always fall for the clammy hands.
               It's physical evidence of illness. It's
               a good, non-specific symptom. Parents are
               generally pretty hip to the fever scams.
               And to make them work you have to go a hundred
               and one, hundred and two. You get a nervous
               mother and you end up in a doctor's office
               and that's worse than school.

     He flips on his stereo and fills the room with the MTV
     broadcast. A NEW SONG begins.FERRISFake a stomach cramp and when you're
               doubled over, moaning and wailing, just
               lick your palms. It's a little stupid
               and childish but then so if high school.
               Right?

     He equalizes the sound a little.FERRISThis is my ninth sick day with semester.
               If I go for ten, I'm probably going to
               have to barf up a lung. So, I absolutely
               must make this one count.

     He exits into the hallway.11  INT. BATHROOM                                                11Ferris walks into the bathroom. It's littered with Jean's
     debris. He turns on the shower water.FERRISI don't care if you're fifty five
               or seven, everybody needs a day off
               now and then. It's a beautiful day.
               How can I be expected to handle
               high school?

     He bends down OUT OF FRAME as he loses his briefs. He pops
     up.FERRISI do actually have a test. That wasn't
               bullshit.

     He steps into the shower. Through the pebbled glass of the
     shower door we see Ferris' outline.FERRISThat I care about it was.12  INT. BATHROOM. SHOWER STALL.                                 12Inside the shower. Ferris' hair is standing straight up.
     It's moulded into a fin with shampoo.FERRISIt's on European socialism. I mean,
               really. What's the point? I'm not
               European. I don't plan to be European.
               So, who gives a shit if they're socialists?
               They could be fascist anarchists and it
               still wouldn't change the fact that I
               don't own a car.

     He turns the shower head around and uses it like a
     microphone.FERRIS(sings)WELL SHAKE IT UP, BABY,TWIST AND SHOUT...13  INT. HALLWAY. LATER                                          13Ferris comes out of the bathroom with a towel wrapped around
     his waist. He's drying his hair with another of a different
     color.FERRISNot that I condone fascism. Or
               and "isms". "Isms", in my opinion
               are not good. A person should not
               believe in an "ism". He should
               believe in himself. John Lennon
               said it on his first solo album.
               "I don't believe in Beatles, I
               just believe in me." A good point
               there. Afterall, he was the Walrus.

     He opens a linen closet and tosses the towel in it.FERRISI could be the Walrus and I'd still
               have to bum rides off people.

     He passes CAMERA and goes into his room.FERRIS (OC)I'm not very political? Let me
               put that into perspective...14  INT. BEDROOM                                                 14Ferris tosses the towel he's dried hair with on the bed.FERRISMy uncle went to Canada to protest
               the war, right? On the Fourth of
               July he was down with my aunt and he
               got drunk and told my Dad he felt
               guilty he didn't fight in Viet Nam.
               So I said, "What's the deal, Uncle
               Jeff? In wartime you want to be a
               pacifist and in peacetime you want
               to be a soldier. It took you twenty
               years to find out you don't believe
               in anything?"
                          (snaps his fingers)
               Grounded. Just like that. Two weeks.
                          (pause)
               Be careful when you deal with old
               hippies. They can be real touchy.

     He opens his door.15  INT. CLOSET                                                  15The door opens and Ferris rifles through his shirts.FERRISMy mother was a hippie. But she
               lost it. She got old. If she listens
               to the White Album now? She doesn't hear
               music, she hears memories. Nostalgia is
               her favorite drug. It'll probably be
               mine, too. I hope not.

     He finds a shirt he likes. He steps back from the closet and
     puts it on. He drops the towel.16  INT. BEDROOM                                                 16He walks across the room to his dresser. He opens his
     underwear drawer. There's an old model of a submarine on the
     top of the dresser. He picks it up.FERRISIn eighth grade a friend of mine
               made a bong out of one of these.
               The smoke tasted like glue.

     He pulls out a pair of underwear. He gets dressed as he
     speaks.FERRISHis name is Garth Volbeck. He's a
               serious outsider. Not a bad guy, I
               like him. I'm probably his only friend.
               I do what I can for him. I mean, if
               I was him, I'd appreciate it. Do unto others,
               right? Anyway, his mother owns a gas station.
               His father's dead and his sister's rumored
               to be a prostitute, which is complete bullshit.
               She only puts out so people will hang out
               with her. It's sad but I don't hold it
               against her. Better to hold it against the
               guys who use her and don't care about her.
                          (pause)
               My parents never allowed Garth over here.
               It was because of his family. Mainly his
               older brother. He's in jail. I could see them
               not wanting his brother here because he is
               a registered psycho. I wouldn't want him here.
               I once watched the guy eat a whole bowl of
               artificial fruit just so he could see what
               it was like to have his stomach pumped.
               But Garth isn't his brother. It isn't his fault
               that his brother's screwed-up. Alot of fights
               with the parents on that point. I always felt
               for Garth. I was sleeping at his house once
               and I was laying on the dark worrying that
               his brother was going to come in and hack me
               to death with an ax and I heard Garth crying.
               I asked him what was wrong and he said, "Nothing".
               ... Nothing was wrong. There was no
               specific thing he was crying about.
               In fact, he wasn't really even aware that
               he was crying. He just cried himself to
               sleep every night. It was a habit. The
               guy's so conditioned to grief that if
               he doesn't feel it, he can't sleep. How
               could you possibly dump on guy who has to
               deal with that kinda shit? My parents
               acknowledge the trudge of the situation
               and I'm sure that deep down, they do feel
               for him but still the guy's banned from
               our house.

     He looks at himself in the mirror on the back of his closet
     door. He doesn't like what he's wearing. He continues his
     speech as he disrobes.FERRISUnfortunately, now my parents have a
               legit argument. Garth doesn't need his
               brother to give him a rep anymore. He's
               getting one on his own. He's lost. It's
               over for him. He's eighteen. Gone from
               school. Gone from life. His legacy is
               a gas station.17  INT. HOUSE. STAIRCASE                                        17Ferris comes down the stairs. He's wearing a completely
     different outfit.FERRISOne very serious danger is playing
               sick is that it's possible to believe
               your own act.18  INT. KITCHEN                                                 18Ferris comes into the kitchen and crosses to the
     refrigerator.FERRISThat and boredom. Alot of people
               ditch and feel great for about an
               hour. Then they realize there's
               nothing to do. TV and food. I myself
               have ditched and gotten so bored I
               did homework. Figure that shit out.

     He takes a sip out of a bottle of orange juice.FERRISYou have to plan things out before
               you take the day off. Otherwise
               you get all nervous worrying about
               what to do and all you get is grief
               and the whole point is to take it
               easy, cut loose and enjoy.

     He crosses to the pantry.FERRISYou blow your day and at about three
               o'clock, when everybody's out of school,
               you're going to wish you'd gone to
               school so you could be out having
               fun.

     He emerges from the pantry with a handful of Oreos.FERRISAvoid the misery. Plan your day.
               Do it right.19  INT. FAMILY ROOM                                             19Ferris walks in and flops down in an armchair.FERRISThere's alot of pressure at work
               in my age group. And it's not always
               recognized.

     He reaches over and picks up the telephone. He sets it in
     his lap.FERRISSome guy whose hair is falling out
               and his stomach's hanging over his
               belt and everything he eats makes
               him fart, he looks at someone like

               met Cameron and I saw how his

               each other? I refuse to sleep over at
               his house. His parents fight all the
               time. Even when I'm there. Is there
               anything worse than being at somebody's
               house when their parents are fighting?
               It's the absolute height of social

               tightens up. It's scary. He gets so
               wadded-up, you couldn't pry his buns
               apart with a crowbar. The thing with
               taking his old man's car? It's good
               for him. It teaches him to deal with
               his fear. Plus, and I must
               be honest here, I love driving it.

     wipes his suit off. The TV camera zooms in on the boy
     triumphantly holding the foul ball aloft. It's Ferris.
