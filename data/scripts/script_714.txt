"Lord of Illusions" -- by Clive BarkerTITLE SEQUENCEAs the credits run, we INTERCUT the following two sequences:EXT. NEVADA DESERT - IDOLS - DAYA SLOW DRIFT through a collection of crudely constructed,
	surreal, six-foot tall "IDOLS."  Like modern demons. 
	Grotesque.  Disturbing. WE LAP DISSOLVE between details of
	their twisted anatomies:  headlamp eyes, bright metal claws,
	broken glass teeth.EXT. NEVADA ROADS - DESERT - DAYTwo vehicles, one a Volkswagen "bus" decorated with stylized
	flames, the other a '66 Thunderbird, speeding along a series
	of eerily empty desert roads, somewhere in a wilderness of
	sand and heat.END CREDITS.CUT WIDE TO;EXT. NEVADA DESERT - DAYA violent WIND HOWLS around, but through the sand we-can just
	make out a large, ominous building:  the HOUSE of William
	Nix.  Its walls are white-washed and scrawled with GRAFFITI. 
	The "family" of IDOLS surrounds the doorway, guarding it. ON
	SCREEN, the words:  '"Nevada - Thirteen Years Ago"EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DAYWe're at the front door now, which stands open.  Leaning
	against the door-frame is a scrawny, wild-eyed YOUTH, about
	sixteen.  His name is BUTTERFIELD.  He's got a brooding,
	almost sultry look on his face.  One of his eyes is black,
	the other milky blue.  He's whittling something with a
	scalpel. Distantly, the sound of CAR ENGINES.  Butterfield
	narrows his eyes.BUTTERFIELD'S P.O.V.The Volkswagen "bus" and Thunderbird are approaching the
	house.BUTTERFIELD(softly)
		Swann...?

	He turns from the door.  In his haste he drops the WOOD he's
	whittling.  He's been carving a DEATH'S HEAD.INT. NIX'S HOUSE - ROOMS AND CORRIDORS - DAYThe house no longer serves any domestic function.  It has
	become the temple and dormitory of Nix's small apocalyptic
	cult.  As we go through the house with Butterfield we glimpse
	a little of what life here is like. 

	The rooms are murky, and chaotic.  The walls, PAINTED with
	scenes of cities and landscapes BURNING, and creatures from
	some unspeakable nightmare ATTACKING, RAPING, and DEVOURING
	helpless humanity.  The atmosphere is joyless, and
	oppressive. 

	The passages become progressively darker as the boy makes his
	way to the heart of the house.  Only OIL LAMPS, set on the
	floor, light these claustrophobic corridors.BUTTERFIELDMaster?INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - DAYA dozen CULTISTS sit cross-legged on the floor in front of
	their leader, WILLIAM NIX.  His black hair grows to his
	shoulders.  His eyes are deep and glittering, his voice
	seductive.  A terrifying yet charismatic presence. 

	All the Cultists - who are a cross-section of obsessives -
	wear the same simple T-shirts, painted with the cult's SIGIL. 
	They watch Nix in adoration. 

	As Nix speaks, he juggles a FLAME, passing it from hand to
	hand with casual ease...NIXAnd the fire said to me:  Nix, Nix,
		you're my instrument. From now on,
		you'll be called the Puritan...CULTISTS(murmuring)
		Puritan...

	NIX You will find a few good men and women, and together,
	together you will cleanse the world.CULTISTSYes...

	Butterfield enters.BUTTERFIELDMaster?

	Nix looks up.BUTTERFIELDSwann's here. 

	Nix rises, smiling.NIX(to Cultists)
		We'll come back to this. Get about
		your business. 

	As the Cultists disperse, Nix and Butterfield exit intoINT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAYA place of nightmares. Hanging from the middle of the ceiling
	is another grotesque SCULPTURE, three times the bulk of a
	large man, and made of metal, fly-blown animal parts and
	knotted rope.  It is vaguely cruciform, but its swaying,
	creaking bulk is not even faintly Christian.  It is a
	perverse, sickening image, evoking insanity and agony.

	From the shadows in the corner, we hear a young girl's softSOBBING.NIXHush...

	Nix goes to the GIRL.  She is twelve; beautiful, blonde, and
	presently in a state of mortal fear.  She sits, bound, in a
	fetal position, her face soaked with SWEAT and TEARS, her
	mouth BLOODIED, her cheek BRUISED.NIXI said hush.GIRLPlease.  Let me go.

	From the opposite corner the SCREECH of Nix's pet BABOON. 
	Nix goes to it.  The animal is large and lethal.NIX(to Baboon)
		What is it?

	The Baboon pulls on its chain, staring at the Girl and baring
	its teeth as it screeches.NIX(to Girl)
		I think he's in love.

	He unshackles the Baboon.  The animal pads toward the Girl,
	trailing its chain.GIRLKeep it away from me.

	Nix catches hold of its chain.  Holds it back.  The Baboon
	starts screeching again, scrabbling at the Girl, its NAILS
	catching her arms and legs, drawing BLOOD.GIRLPlease... please...

	Nix watches her terror dispassionately.BUTTERFIELD(also watching, wide-
		eyed)
		Want me to shoot Swann?NIXYou don't like him, do you?BUTTERFIELDHe wants your magic.NIXMaybe.  Go fetch him.

	Butterfield exits.  Nix advances on the Girl.GIRLWhat are you going to do?CUT TO:EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DESERT - DAYThe two vehicles come to a halt outside Nix's house.

	From the Thunderbird steps PHILIP SWANN, a nineteen- year-old
	with shoulder-length hair and brilliant blue eyes.  He's not
	conventionally handsome, but he's certainly striking. 

	From the passenger seat steps CASPAR QUAID, a black man,
	studious and intense.  From the bus emerges MURRAY PIMM,
	skinny and jittery, and JENNIFER DESIDERIO, a woman with a
	steely gaze.SWANN(to all three)
		Are we ready?JENNIFER(cool)
		Say the word.PIMM(very nervous)
		Look, maybe we should think this over.

	On Swann, as he brings from his car three very bizarre pieces
	of METALWORK.  We get only a tantalizing glimpse of them, as
	he slips them into his pocket.SWANNNo.  He's gone too far.PIMMSo he took a child.JENNIFERHe'll kill her.PIMMNo he won't.SWANN(determined)
		He's not going to get the chance.

	Quaid checks a gun, then slips it into his belt.QUAIDIf he gets in our fucking heads he'll drive us crazy.SWANNSo stay out here.

	Swann starts towards the House.  Jennifer is the first to
	follow, with the other two on her heels.INT. NIX'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAYButterfield comes to the door, as Swann steps inside.BUTTERFIELDHe's expecting you.

	Behind Swann, Quaid and Pimm exchange nervous looks.SWANN(to others)
		Look around.  If you find 'the
		child, yell.  She's got blonde
		hair, that's all I know.

	Butterfield turns away, smiling to himself.  Swann follows
	him.INT. NIX'S HOUSE - "MEDITATION" ROOM - DAYQuaid looks into a large circular room where FIVE CULTISTS
	(three men and two women) still sit.  One of the women is
	breast-feeding a baby.1ST MANHey, Quaid.  I thought you said you
		weren't coming back.QUAIDI changed my mind.1ST WOMANCome and join us.

	She smiles a crazy smile.  Reaches out for Quaid.  A SNAKE
	appears from around the back of her neck.  Quaid recoils. 

	And now we see that there are snakes everywhere.  In the
	Cultists' clothes and hair.  Even on the baby.  Quaid turns
	away.  And - shock! - there's a SNAKE on the door frame,
	winding around his hand.  He strikes it to the ground, and
	drives his heel down on its head.SNAKE-HANDLER CULTIST(angry)
		Don't do that!

	The Snake-Handler gets up.  Quaid retreats from the door. 
	Snake-Handler picks up the dead snake and, lifting it above
	his head, dribbles its BLOOD onto his face.INT.   NIX'S  HOUSE  -   "BEDROOM"   -  DAYJennifer enters a gloomy room.  She goes to a mattress where
	a BLONDE GIRL lies with her bare back to us.JENNIFERDon't be afraid.

	The Blonde Girl, BARBARA, turns over.  She has a dirty cloth
	pressed to a wound between her breasts.  It is not the Girl,
	of course.  She stares up at Jennifer, clearly drugged.BARBARAI'm not... want to see?

	She pulls the cloth away.  She has carved the cult SIGIL into
	her FLESH.  The BLOODY KNIFE lies beside her. Jennifer
	retreats to the door, and exits back out into --INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAYPimm is standing against the wall, clutching a CRUCIFIX. He
	is ashen with terror.  Jennifer snatches the crucifix from
	his white-knuckled fingers.PIMMHe's going to kill us all...JENNIFERWhere did Swann go?

	Pimm points down the passageway towards Nix's room.INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE NIX'S SANCTUM - DAYSwann wipes sweat from his upper lip, then reaches down to
	his belt, to check the GUN tucked out of sight at his side. 
	He turns the door handle.INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAYSwann steps inside.  Nix's chair has its back to him. The
	folds of Nix's robe are visible, however.  Swann hears a
	muffled SOBBING from the far side of the room. 

	On the Girl, now gagged and lying amongst bones and filth.

	Swann starts towards her, his footsteps barely audible.  As
	he approaches the chair - the Baboon leaps at him screeching!

	He reaches for his gun.  The chair topples.  The Baboon, half
	dressed in Nix's robes, bounds towards Swann. 

	Swann FIRES at it.  The bullet blasts off half its head.INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAYOn Quaid, who draws his GUN as three CULTISTS appear in the
	passageway that leads to Nix's Sanctum.QUAIDStay the fuck away!

	struggles with the Girl's gag.  He has laid his gun on the
	ground beside her.SWANNYou're going to be okay.

	Out of focus, behind him, the cruciform sculpture swings
	round.  Nix is hanging on it, like an idol on a grotesque
	altarpiece. 

	The Girl sees Nix over Swann's shoulder.  Terror crosses her
	face.  Swann turns.NIXI knew you'd come. 

	He reaches down to Swann.NIXI've got so much power to give
		you, Swann.  All you have to do

	against the wall.NIXI could eat your fucking soul,

	She retreats, staunching her bleeding hand.INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAYNix has Swann trapped against the wall and is working his
	fingers against Swann's temples.  Working, working, like a
	psychic surgeon plying against the belly of a patient.NIXYou want to know what the world

	Swann struggles, but he can't get free of Nix's hold. 

	And now -- horribly -- Nix's fingers slide beneath the skin
	of Swann's temples, without a drop of blood being spilt.NIXWant to see flesh with a god's

	Swann SCREAMS as Nix's mind-hold seizes him.INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAYQuaid levels his gun at Butterfield, who is guarding the
	Sanctum door.  Jennifer is at Quaid's side.SWANN (V.O.)Aah!QUAIDGet away from the door!

	Butterfield shakes his head.  Quaid FIRES.  The bullet.
	strikes the wall beside Butterfield's head.  He retreats,

	open, and enters.INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAYQUAIDSwann?NIX(to Quaid)

	Swann stumbles into the middle of the room, the whites of his

	On Swann, reeling like a drunkard as he looks up at Quaid and
	Jennifer.JENNIFER (V.O.)What have you done to him?SWANN'S P.O.V.of Quaid and Jennifer.  To Swann's eyes, their faces seem to
	be MORPHING.  Their humanity is MELTING AWAY. What's left is
	like a jellyfish with black, soulless eyes:  PRIMEVAL MUCK.QUAID (V.O.)Swann.  It's okay.

	Quaid reaches for Swann, who retreats in horror, shaking his
	head violently.SWANNDon't touch me.  He's got... got

	Swann turns away from Quaid and Jennifer in disgust.SWANN'S P.O.V.of Nix, his arms outstretched in welcome.  His face has an
	aura of pulsing light.NIXCome here.  Share the power.

	ON a GUN, leveled. .We don't see by whom.  The trigger is
	pulled. 

	The bullet strikes Nix's back and explodes out of his chest.

	ON SWANN, staring at Nix. 

	SWANN'S P.O.V. of Nix, as the aura of light dies. 

	Just for a moment - a terrible moment - Swann glimpses
	something else. MORPHING out of Nix's features.  A NIGHTMARE
	FACE with waves of DARKNESS emanating from the middle of its
	forehead. 

	Swann covers his eyes.NIX(raging, terrifying)
		Swann!  Swann!

	Nix staggers, letting out an ungodly HOWL, and drops to his
	knees, clutching the WOUND.  As he falls, he reveals the
	ashen Girl, who is still holding Swann's smoking GUN.NIX(a roar)
		Help me!

	Swann shakes his head, ridding himself of Nix's mind-
	control.SWANNJesus-INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE SANCTUM - DAYPinon stands guard, his gun pointed on several cultists.1ST CULTIST(with distressing

	Quaid FIRES at him again. Strikes his shoulder.  And again. 
	Strikes his leg.  Nix collapses to the ground,JENNIFERQuickly!

	They have come prepared for this.  Swann now takes from his
	jacket the three strange pieces of METALWORK.  There are
	SCREWS in then all.NIX(seeing)
		Swann?  What are you doing?SWANNBinding you.

	He clamps one of the pieces over Nix's EYES.  It fits like an
	eyeless mask.  Nix thrashes and SCREAMS.  Swann lays his
	hands on the side of the mask, and � LIKE MAGIC -- his touch
	makes the screws tighten of their own accord, grinding into
	Nix's flesh and bone with a gut- wrenching SOUND.  BLOOD runs
	from the screw-holes.NIXFuck you, Swann!  Fuck you!

	Now the second piece, over his MOUTH.NIXSw�

	He's silenced.  The piece screws itself into-his head, like
	the first.  And now comes the third and final piece:  over
	the nose and into the ears.  Again, it screws itself into
	place. 

	Swann has done all he can.  He retreats from Nix's body, as
	it continues to convulse.  We go from face to ashen face, as
	each man and woman watches and waits.  Why won't he die? 

	And now, at last  the violence of Nix's death-throes
	diminishes.  Nix's body bends like a bow, arching off the
	ground, and with one last, terrible spasm, he dies.GIRL(quietly)
		Is it finished?SWANNIt's finished.INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAYThe Cultists' faces slacken, as though some mental hold Nix
	had upon them has disappeared.  Then they start to retreat,

	into the back of Murray Pimm's bus. 

	ON Butterfield.  He watches, with a feral look on his face.FADE OUTFADE INEXT. LOS ANGELES - MONTAGE - DAYThe city looks magical in the spring light, its palms and
	gleaming towers, its rivers of sun-baked traffic, evoking
	some fantastical metropolis.  This, for all its smog and
	congestion, is a city of exoticism and enchantments.

	Tapert emerges, his face white with terror.  He stumbles to

	past faded PHOTOGRAPHS of Caspar Quaid with famous faces.

	At the landing, the passageway turns ninety degrees. Harry
	halts, and takes out his GUN. 

	There's a strange RUMBLING SOUND approaching from round the
	corner.  Harry chances a look.  There's a short length of
	passageway, leading to an open door.  From the threshold a
	CRYSTAL BALL rolls towards Harry, BLOOD- SMEARED.  This is
	the source of the rumbling.  Harry stops the ball before it
	falls down the stairs. 

	Dead silence.  After a beat, Harry creeps towards the open
	door.  He pushes it open.  Inside, chaos.  The fake antique
	FURNITURE is splintered, the ASTRAL CHARTS slashed.INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - WAITING ROOM - NIGHTThere are two offices.  In the front, a Waiting Room, into
	which Harry now steps.  Beyond it, through a door that stands
	narrowly ajar, the Fortune Telling Room. 

	From out of the Fortune Telling Room, a MOAN.QUAID (V.O.)Ahh. . .

	Harry crosses the Waiting Room, reaching into his jacket for
	his gun.  Suddenly, a nightmarish FIGURE leaps from the
	shadows. 

	His name is RAY MILLER.  He's as crazy as a rabid dog, teeth
	sharpened, eyes wild.  Nix's SIGIL is tattooed on the middle
	of his forehead.  He STRIKES the GUN from Harry's hand and
	goes for his throat. 

	Harry reaches out behind him, picks up a phrenologist's BUST
	and SMASHES it on Miller's skull. 

	Miller reels back.  Harry makes a dash for the door to the
	Fortune Telling Room.MILLERFuckhead.INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - FORTUNE-TELLING ROOM - NIGHTA mysterious, candle-lit space.  In the middle of the room, a
	table.  At it sits Quaid. thirteen years older. He has been
	tortured close to death.  Several small SCALPELS protrude
	from his chest and neck.  His life is ebbing away.  On the
	table in front of him, a fan of TAROT CARDS, BLOOD-SPATTERED.

	Harry races in through the open door from the Waiting Room.HARRYWhat the fuck!?

	Harry picks up the PHONE.  It's dead.  Miller charges at the
	door.HARRYShit!

	Harry SLAMS the door in Miller's face, and locks it. 

	As he does so, the candles FLICKER.  Harry looks up.  A
	FIGURE looms from the darkness behind Quaid.  He's in his
	late twenties:  an androgynous, disturbing sight. His long
	hair is drawn back into a pony-tail.  His mismatched eyes -
	one black, one milky blue, tell us that he is Butterfield. 
	His hands are BLOODY, and he carries one last SCALPEL.HARRY(to Butterfield)
		Don't touch him."

	Butterfield strokes the wounds on Quaid's cheek.  Quaid sobs
	in pain.BUTTERFIELDWhat are you going to do about it? 

	Miller's hand tears at the wood around the lock from the
	other side.  His fingers appear, scrabbling to tear the lock
	out.  Harry doesn't move, or Miller will be through.BUTTERFIELD(to Harry)
		Ever watched a man die?  If you
		watch very closely, you can
		sometimes see the soul escaping. 
		And if you're very quick, you can
		catch it.QUAIDPlease... Butterfield... I wasn't
		there.  Ask Pimm.BUTTERFIELDPimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's
		disappeared.  They knew the Puritan
		was coming home. 

	As this exchange goes on, Miller pulls the lock out of the
	door and starts to THROW HIMSELF against it from the other
	side.  It's all Harry can do to keep himself from being
	pitched across the room.  He looks around for some means of
	defense.  There's a crack in the drapes to the left of the
	table.  Behind it a WINDOW.BUTTERFIELDSo do you.  You've seen the future. 
		Haven't you?QUAIDYes.BUTTERFIELDAnd are you afraid?QUAIDYes.

	Suddenly, Harry steps aside.  The door's flung open. Miller
	CHARGES in.  Harry catches hold of his arm, and THROWS him
	against the drape.  The window CRACKS; the drape comes down
	around Miller.  Amber STREETLIGHT floods in. 

	Butterfield is momentarily distracted.  Harry STRIKES the
	scalpel from his hands. 

	Miller, meanwhile, is struggling to free himself from the
	folds of the drapes.  Harry lands a solid KICK to the man's
	belly.  Miller is THROWN back against the cracked window,
	which SHATTERS.  Still wrapped in the drape, he FALLS OUT. 

	Harry turns back to arrest Butterfield, but he's already
	making his escape.  Harry starts after him.QUAID(to Harry)
		Don't leave me.

	He turns back.  TEARS are pouring down the man's face. Harry
	goes back to comfort Quaid, as Butterfield escapes down the

	A SLIT OPENS in the middle of Nix's forehead, above the
	bridge of his nose (this is an image we saw in the prints in
	the library), and from it comes a WAVE OF DARKNESS.  As Nix
	REVOLVES, the darkness STRIKES the GROUND around the
	Cultists.

	At first they don't realize what's going on.  They think this
	is some kind of bizarre blessing. 

	Then the ground starts to LIQUIFY beneath them.NORMANWhat's happening?NIXI have to give something back. So
		I'm giving you.

	They're starting to SCREAM now as they sink into the ground.

	Harry appears in the doorway.  Nix, still swinging round, has
	his back to Harry.NIXWell I'm not your shepherd.

	Harry surveys the horrific scene in front of him.  The ground
	is now re-solidifying around the Cultists, some of whom have
	disappeared from view completely, some of whom still reach up
	out of the dirt.  The scene has a surreal beauty to it

	watch him die, but races out into the passageway, BLOOD

	Nix reaches down to torment Harry.  But before he can make
	contactSWANN (V.O.)Nix!

	Nix looks up.NIXThere you are. 

	Suddenly, Nix isn't interested in Harry and Dorothea. He
	steps onto solid ground, and walks towards Swann, his tone
	suddenly conversational.NIXI've had a lot of time to think
		about you.  Where I went wrong...

	Butterfield is there!  His face is horribly burned, but he's
	still very much alive.BUTTERFIELDBastard!

	He launches himself at Harry, driving them both back into the
	BROKEN GLASS.  A FIGHT ensues, carrying them out into the
	Passageway. 

	Nix has Swann in a bear-hug.NIXWill you help me? 

	A beat.  Then Swann nods.SWANNYes.

	Nix lets him go.NIXYou know I'll kill you when we're
		done.  I have to.SWANNYes.NIXBut until then... it's you and

	Dorothea, at the doorway, watches this bizarre exchange.
	Swann's eyes flicker towards her.  Nix turns.NIXWait... you still feel something
		for that bitch?SWANNNo!NIXLiar!

	Nix makes a gesture, and Swann is flung against the wall,
	pinned there like a fly, legs off the ground.NIXWill!  You!  Never!  Learn!?

	With each word, Nix almost casually throws a gesture in
	Swann's direction, and though there is six feet between them,
	they have the force of terrible blows.  One to the ribs. 
	They CRACK.  One to the face.  It BLEEDS.  One to the legs,

	Dorothea.NIXShe's just flesh, Swannnie-boy.

	Harry looks up.  Sees Dorothea retreating from the door, and
	running off into the darkness. 

	Butterfield comes at Harry again.  Harry's got no more time
	for this creep.  He delivers Butterfield a backhand swipe,
	and Butterfield lands face down in the glass.  We don't see
	the impact.  HEARING it's enough. 

	Harry looks down at the body.  Then --NIX (V.O.)Where is she?

	Nix GRABS hold of Harry's head with one hand and PRESSES the
	fingers of -the other hand against Harry's TEMPLES. He
	struggles to get free, but Nix is simply too powerful.

	Nix's fingers slowly SLIDE BENEATH the skin of Harry's
	temples.  As before, there's no blood.NIXYou've got Swann's disease. You

	One last, terrifying transformation is overtaking Nix as he
