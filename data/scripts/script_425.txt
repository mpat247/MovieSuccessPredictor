          style building splits the roads 100 yards ahead. Still hear
          metal scraping against asphalt.. .then it stops.
          BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER OF FRAME, a wheelbarrow filled with 250
          pounds of black asphalt edges into frame, followed by the guy
          sweating, struggling as he pushes it, GEORGE "MICKY" WARD
          JR., 31, short, compact, close-cropped reddish-blonde hair,
          little boy face, glancing over his shoulder, dumps the
          wheelbarrow on old cracked cement.. .picks up a scraping-
          spreading tool on a metal broom stick, and commences to
          spread out the new asphalt. Trying to complete a newly paved
          road to the right which ends in this intersection. The
          scraping tool spreading the new asphalt. Micky sweating,
          dirty from asphalt.
          Now skinny bare arms start shadowboxing around Micky working.
          Only the arms enter frame in combinations, shadow punches.MICKY(ignoring punches, keepsSPREADING ASPHALT)Will you help me finish this?
          He turns and kinda smiles as leans away with the rake, then
          slips and moves with the punches being thrown by RICHARD

          arms, backwards baseball cap, shorts, work boots, enters
          frame, shadowboxing around Micky, smiles missing teeth. The
          two brothers play spar, joking, having fun. Micky throws a
          and Dicky play snaps his head back. Then Dicky does it to
          Micky. Then Micky throws an upper cut and Dicky pops his head
          up, broken toy robot.DICKYYou knocked my block off!
