          been through a long vigil and it shows in their tired eyes
          and disarranged clothing. One is a young gentlewoman with
          a sweet girlish face, KATE KELLER; the second is an elderly
          DOCTOR, stethoscope at neck, thermometer in fingers; the
          third is a gruff gentleman in his forties with chin whis-
          kers, CAPTAIN ARTHUR KELLER.DOCTORShet11 live.
          KATE closes her eyes.

          wouldn't,KELLER(INDULGENT)I've brought up two of them, but

          how to do it better than we do.
          These things come and go in infants,
          never know why. Call it acute
          congestion of the stomach and brain.

          we see only KATE'S face hovering over us, her hand adjust-

          I've never seen a baby, more
          vitality, that's the truth --
          Their voices and footsteps fade. KATE is bent lovingly
          over the crib, which emits a bleat; her finger is play-
          ful with the baby's face.KATEHush. Don't you cry now, you've
          been trouble enough. Call it
          acute congestion, indeed, I don't
          see what's so cute about a con-
          gestion, just because it's yours?
          We'll have your father run an
          editorial in his paper, the wonders
          of modern medicine, they don't know
          what they're curing even when they
          cure it. Men, men and their battle

          At a window we see the faces of Percy 8 years, and Martha,
          7 years, looking in. HELENrS hand gets a Christmas ball
          and rips it down, shattering at her feet. CRAB IN AND
          AROUND coming to the side of the tree, seeing HELENtS

          The dog is a setter named BELLE, and she is sleeping. Two

          person with a fine head, attractive, but noticeably blind,

          0 paper-doll cutouts, and while they speak, HELEN'S hands
          thrust at their faces in turn, feeling baffledly at the
          movements of their lips. The CAMERA is on this; the
          dialogue is only background.MARTHA(SNIPPING)First Itm gonna cut off this doe-

          But HELEN is poking her fingers inside his mouth, to feel
          his tongue; he bites at them, annoyed, and she jerks them
          away. HELEN now fingers her own lips, moving them in
          imitation, but soundlessly. Again the CAMERA on this.MARTHAWhat you do, bite hand?PERCYThat's how I do, she keep pokint.

          moving in silence, growing more and more frantic,
          until in a bizarre rage she bites at her own fingers.
