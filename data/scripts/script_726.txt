          based on the life of Sam ChildersFINAL SHOOTING DRAFT9/30/2010This is true...EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT - (2003)The night is stillborn.
                         
          Without sound or movement and nothing is in definition. All we see
          are degrees of blackness in this unlit world. The vague impressions
          of an African village in the void... a ragged line of tukuls (straw
          huts)... a bicycle propped against a mud wall... a soccer ball in
          the dirt...INT. TUKUL - NIGHTAnd we find a Sudanese family asleep on reed mats. A mother, father
          and their two boys. The younger boy we'll come to know as "WILLIAM"
          (9). His older brother "CHRISTOPHER" (12) curled next to him.EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHTAnd slowly the blackness begins to shift... an otherworldly light
          seeping in from someplace far off... shadows contorting in a ghostly
          orange flicker... images emerging... the silhouettes of men coming
          into this village carrying flaming torches.INT. TUKUL - NIGHTThe family still sound asleep, oblivious to the torch glow coming
          from outside, and suddenly --SCREAMING! -- GUNSHOTS!The family bolts awake, moving to their feet as the door to their
          tukul SLAMS open -- THREE soldiers from the Lord's Resistance Army
          (LRA) coming in carrying AK47's -- shouting in Arabic -- "Get up!
          Get up!" -- the FATHER stepping forward -- holding up his hands --
          "Don't shoot!" --KAK! KAK! KAK!And he's gunned down in cold blood. The soldiers grab the mother and
          boys and begin to drag them out of the tukul -- but WILLIAM breaks
          free -- scrambles deeper into the room --
                         
          THE SOLDIER going after him -- WILLIAM darting behind a stack of
          storage boxes knocking them to the ground -- frantically burrowing
          into the corner -- trying to get away but it's useless -- THE
          SOLDIER grabs his feet and begins to pull him out -- WILLIAM KICKING
          WILDLY -- digging his nails into the dirt -- and as he's dragged out
          of the corner he reaches out... inadvertently grabs a FADED
          PHOTOGRAPH which has fallen on the ground...EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHTCHAOS! -- PANDEMONIUM! -- the black sky ablaze in apocalyptic fire --2families yanked out of their burning tukuls by LRA rebels -- the
          adult males of this village shot dead or bludgeoned to death -- the
          women and children forced into the center of the village -- huddled
          together and weeping --
                         
          -- and now we see WILLIAM hauled out -- his captor shouting to
          another soldier -- pointing to WILLIAM'S mother and she's pulled
          from the group and forced onto her knees...
                         
          ... and WILLIAM is brought in front of her -- his captor saying
          something in Arabic as he hands him a club -- "Kill her!" -- WILLIAM
          shaking his head `no' -- tossing the club in the dirt and --
                         
          CRACKKK! -- WILLIAM is hit with the butt of a rifle -- goes down --
          blood streaming down his face as he's pulled back up to his feet --
          crying -- shaking with fear...
                         
          ... and then he sees his mother staring up at him... and despite the
          hell unfolding around them we see a moment here between mother and
          son... something calm and reassuring in the way she's looking at him
          now... her eyes full of love... and pity... for her child in this
          terrible moment... and before we see how this ends we --CUT TO:BLACKNESSFOR A LONG BEAT -- AND THEN WE BLEED UP WHITE LETTERS ON THE BLACKSCREEN THAT READ --MACHINEGUN PREACHER...

PRISON CORRIDOR - RURAL PENNSYLVANIA - DAY - (AUGUST/1998)And we see SAM CHILDERS coming down a corridor toward us, dressed in
          jailhouse orange and flanked by a guard. He's stocky, 32 years old,
          with a biker's handlebar moustache. On the surface he appears good-
          looking... even handsome if the light is right... but his face is
          tricky... always changing... behind the quick smile, around his dark
          eyes, in the taut muscles of his neck we see violence.INT. PRISON RECEIVING AND RELEASING - DAYWe see a CLERK handing Sam a prison issue tub full of his personal
          affects. He takes out his clothes, digs out a leather wallet, a
          watch, some silver rings and a lighter.

          "Welcome Home Daddy!"
                         
          And now Sam's daughter PAIGE (6) bursts out of the trailer and down

          Thinner than the last time we saw him, skin sallow and drawn tight
          over his face. He stirs awake, sees Paige playing by herself on the

          quietly goes outside without saying a word.INT. BATHROOM - CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - MORNINGSam coming in, taking a piss, staring at himself in the mirror and

          Sam offers him a can and he takes it.DENGThank you.SAMGot a question for ya.DENGYes?SAMI wanna go into Sudan this weekend. Need

           some country.
                         
          Deng looks at him, surprised by the request...DENGYou want to see?EXT. DIRT ROAD - RURAL UGANDA - DAYA dirt road cutting through grassy plain stretching in every
          direction... and we see a BRIGHT YELLOW BUS speeding toward us in
          the distance, kicking a rooster tail of dust high into the air...
          and as it gets closer we see 15 or 20 men piled onto the roof,
          hanging on for dear life as this bus bounces over the road...INT. BUS - DRIVING - RURAL UGANDA - SAME... Sam and Deng crammed into this crowded bus...SAMThey always drive this fast?DENGTraveling is the most dangerous time in
           Sudan. If the rebels find you on the open
           road it would be very bad.
                         
          An awkward silence as Deng stares out the window. Sam wanting to
          connect here, but Deng is reticent.SAMYou got kids, Deng?DENGNo. I have no children.SAMWhere you from?DENGA little village called Aweil. Many hours
           from here.SAMThat's where your family is?
                         
          And Deng simply says...DENGMy family was killed by LRA.(BEAT)Unyama is about two hours from here. We
           will stop there for lunch.30Deng turns and looks out the window again, silent, quietly watching
          the land blur past. And Sam says nothing more, intuitively feeling
          this man's need to be alone in the moment. A great, lost giant.EXT. UNYAMA REFUGEE CAMP, UGANDA - DAYA dense sea of people. 20,000 displaced refugees living on top of
          each other.
                         
          Life is lived out in the open here... women bent over brightly
          colored washtubs sloshing clothes in soapy water... smoke from giant
          cooking pots drifting into the air... semi-clothed children, some
          with even younger children on their hips, running everywhere. The
          poverty and hopelessness is overwhelming.
                         
          And we see Sam and Deng walking through the camp...DENGThe Muslim North has tried to kill the
           Christian South for 30 years. Two million
           have lost their lives...
                         
          Deng sweeping his hand, indicating the mass of refugees.DENG (CONT'D)... these people have been driven from
           their villages, however these camps are
           not much better...EXT. MEDICAL AREA - UNYAMA REFUGEE CAMP, UGANDA - DAYA row of wood sheds and worn nylon tents marks the hospital area.
          Each enclosure jammed with the desperately sick. Battle-weary AID
          WORKERS move among them, doing what they can, caring for the ones
          who are most desperately ill.DENGCholera and Malaria are everywhere, there
           is little food and not enough UN soldiers
           to protect everyone. Even here they worry
           the LRA will attack at night.
                         
          And another SPLA soldier comes up to Deng --SPLA SOLDIER 1(ARABIC)Are you from Kitgum?DENG(ARABIC)Yes.SPLA SOLDIER 1(ARABIC)Someone wants to speak with you.31Deng turns to Sam...DENGI'm sorry, Sam... I'll be five minutes.SAMCourse, do what you gotta do.
                         
          Deng leaves and now Sam is completely alone, taking in this mire of
          humanity all around him. And suddenly there's COMMOTION! -- two aid
          workers coming into this tent carrying a WOMAN on a stretcher. One
          of the aid workers looking around -- a white woman -- mid 30's --
          her name is AGNETE CLOSSON, Regional Director of Doctors Without
          Borders. She sees Sam across the tent.AGNETEExcuse me. You. Can you help please?
                         
          Sam moving to her --AGNETE (CONT'D)We need to transfer her to the bed. Get
           her shoulders...
                         
          Sam grabbing the woman underneath the shoulders as another aid
          worker gets her feet...AGNETE (CONT'D)One, two, three...
                         
          And they swing the woman over to a cot... but as they do the sheer
          piece of blood-stained muslin that was covering her face falls
          away... and we see that she has been mutilated... her lips cut off
          of her face...
                         
          ... and now a DOCTOR sweeps into the tent and begins to work on her.
          Sam and Agnete pushed back, away from the action. Sam still shocked
          by what he's seen.SAMWhat happened to her face?AGNETEThe rebels cut off her lips because she
           argued. These are Kony's orders.SAMWho's Kony?
                         
          Agnete, suddenly suspicious, takes an appraising look of Sam.AGNETEWho are you with?SAMI'm with Deng over there.32AGNETEWhat organization are you with?SAMWorking with a Christian group down
           South. Just up here takin a look around,

          And she walks off.EXT. NIMULE, SUDAN - DUSKEstablishing a bustling trading center on the border of Uganda and
          Sudan. Noisy and overpopulated, a maze of concrete and tin
          buildings, hundreds of people on the streets, riding bicycles,
          finishing their business before nightfall.INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIMULE, SUDAN - NIGHTA stale room with two cots, bare, institutional. Deng on the edge of
          his cot, pulling off his boots, taking off his jacket, getting
          comfortable. And we see Sam sitting on a small balcony overlooking
          the empty street below.DENGSome say Joseph Kony is a wizard. A

           Christian...
                         
          He pulls a baggy of tobacco from his pocket and begins to roll a
          cigarette...DENG (CONT'D)... but I say he is Satan, who devours
           his own people.SAMKony is the leader of the LRA?DENGHe is the one we have been fighting for
           years. But there is very little we can
           do. Our weapons are old, and our boots
           are full of holes. We have been forgotten
           by the rest of the world.
                         
          And now Deng turns to Sam...33DENG (CONT'D)Why are you here?SAMS'cuse me?DENGWhat are you looking for in this place?SAMAin't lookin for nuthin.

          Sam peering into the darkness but seeing nothing... only empty
          streets... and then one-by-one... out of the darkness like
          apparitions... we see children coming up the street carrying
          bedrolls... some of them singing spiritual hymns as they walk...
          laughing as children do... at first just a dozen or so... and then
          more... fifty... a hundred...EXT. HOTEL ROOM BALCONY - NUMILE, SUDAN - NIGHTDeng steps onto the balcony next to Sam.DENGThey are night commuters. They come from

           villages and refugee camps.
                         
          And we continue to watch this great migration of children... now
          streaming into this town... a few of them finding a dark corner just
          below us... unrolling their reed mats... huddling up against each
          other for the long night...DENG (CONT'D)These are the lucky one so far. The ones

          And he looks up the street and we see more children here than we

          ground which has been left behind.INT. PICKUP TRUCK - DRIVING - RURAL SUDAN - DAYSam, Deng, and a few other SPLA SOLDIERS jammed into the flatbed of

          smoking tukuls. Some children already here, on their knees, weeping
          next to the corpses of their parents. If you could smell the air it
          would smell of burnt flesh and death.

          sister falls onto her mother's corpse and begins to wail as GREEN

          back.79And now we see Nineteen, A.J. and two other SPLA soldiers standing
          around a BUNNY BOUNCER... staring at it quizzically... talking in
          Arabic, trying to decide what this thing is... and then A.J., the
          bravest, slings his AK onto his back and carefully straddles the

          pegs...

          bobs faster... and then we see A.J's smile... a million watt smile

          with pregnant bellies... and incongruously the sound of American rap
          music coming from a jambox somewhere.
                         
          The overriding sense we get from this place is one of `insanity.'115And William is dragged to a clearing next to a grouping of tents and
          he's kicked to the dirt... two other soldiers pinning him to the
          ground as a third grabs his feet and pulls off his shoes... William
          YELLING and now a handful of other LRA soldiers start to gather
