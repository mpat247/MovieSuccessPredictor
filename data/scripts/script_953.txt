    The bad weather that has hovered over the Eifel mountains, (in
    Germany), the past three days is on it's way out..2   AN EYE FLICKERS - WIDE OPEN - STARING INTENTLY                    2A pupil dilates and contracts in the light. The eye stares.
    Blinks. Thinks. Making evaluations..3   EXT. CLOUDY SKY - GERMANY - DAY                                   3The first rays of sunshine break through. The voices of
    international TV commentators in different languages.COMMENTATORS...in places the track is still
               dangerously wet, but following a
               drivers meeting the decision has been
               taken. The race is going ahead...4   INT. FERRARI - DAY                                                4The eye belongs to a 27 year old Formula 1 RACING DRIVER
    wearing a fireproof balaclava...

    Highly intelligent, he also happens to be World Champion. His
    name is painted on the side of his Ferrari. NIKI LAUDA.NIKI (V/O)My grandfather always said history is
               cruel and reductive and no matter how
               long we live, or how much we achieve -
               we are remembered for very little. So
               make sure it's the right things.

    NIKI stares up at the clouds. His eyelids flicker. Thinking.
    Agonizing. Wrestling with an all important decision...

    Is it going to carry on raining? Or become dry? Should he be
    using slicks or wets?5   EXT. STARTING GRID - DAY                                          5We widen to find ourselves on the starting grid of a major
    Grand Prix. All around us...(CONTINUED)25   CONTINUED:                                                       5Engines scream into life as DRIVERS start their cars. An
    OFFICIAL walks through the cars holding aloft a sign, "One
    Minute"...

    Deafening, angry thunder as engines rev impatiently.NIKIThis is bullshit. We have no control
                 over our legacy. We cannot choose what
                 we are remembered for...

    A Ferrari MECHANIC rushes towards NIKI, and shouts in Italian
    above the noise, (we see sub-titles)...MECHANICMass usa slicks. Le vuoi cambiare
                 anche tu?
                     (Mass is going on slicks. You
                      want to change?)

    NIKI looks in his wing-mirror back to see a red McLaren, white
    helmet, number 12, several rows behind him. A team of
    MECHANICS hastily changing the tyres to dry tyres.NIKIOtherwise I wouldn't be remembered for
                 my rivalry with this asshole. And the
                 1976 season.

    NIKI then looks over at the car in pole position beside him.
    Another McLaren, but with number 11, and a Union Jack...NIKIWhat about Hunt? Has he changed?MECHANICNo, he's going on wets.

    The car in pole position: JAMES HUNT, surrounded by TV crews,
    mechanics, girlfriends, hangers-on..

    The Maclaren team is less than half the size of Ferrari's, but
    HUNT makes up for this with magnetism. The rock star of F1.

    NIKI's face: a stab of envy seeing a flash of his rival's
    glamorous long blonde hair disappearing into his balaclava,
    flirting with several hot-looking GIRLS..NIKII don't know why it became such a big
                 thing. We were just drivers. Busting
                 each other's balls. To me this is
                 perfectly normal. But other people saw
                 it differently.(MORE)(CONTINUED)35   CONTINUED: (2)                                                   5NIKI (cont�d)
               That whatever it was between us went
               deeper. And changed us both somehow.
               Forever.

    NIKI stares, then...NIKIBe, allora usiamo anche noi quells da
               bagnato.
                   (Then we go on wets, too.)

    The ten-second board is held up.

    NIKI pulls down his visor...as he and HUNT's eyes meet for a
    split-second, eyes staring...

    NIKI selects second gear for the wet track and revs the
    engine. The dashboard needle climbs through 8000, 9000, 10000RPM.NIKIMaybe that explains the state of mind
               I was in. And why it happened. The
               other thing I'm remembered for.

               On August 1st, that same year...

    CAPTION: "AUGUST 1st, 1976".

    The STARTER waves the flag. NIKI's foot hits the floor - his
    engine screams that deafening, stomach rearranging high-pitch
    scream, drowning out the roar of the 180,000 crowd.

    NIKI's car is catapaulted forward violently, the wheel-spin
    leaving livid black scars on the asphalt..

    NIKI gets away first. A good start! But within seconds there's
    a McLaren car right behind him, breathing down his neck.

    His arch-rival. HUNT.

    But as the McLaren roars past, NIKI sees a white helmet.
    Number 12. It's not Hunt. It's MASS. On his bald, slick tyres.

    NIKI curses under his breath. He screwed up. Made the wrong
    decision. Should have gone on slicks. He urgently needs to
    change tyres...

    NIKI swerves angrily into the pits. Ferrari's pit is right at
    one end...46   INT. PITS - DAY                                                   6Commentary from all the world's TV stations explaining the
    crazy, panicked situation as all the DRIVERS come into the
    pits to change to dry tyres.

    It's chaos. A traffic jam of Formula 1 cars...

    The Ferrari team frantically work. Changing NIKI's tyres. Four
    men with air guns, two men with rapid-duty jacks. The same
    Italian MECHANIC appears, `plugs in' his headset to the car..MECHANICHair visto? Ti aveto detto di usare le
               slicks!
                   (See? I told you to go on
                    slicks!!)NIKIBullshit. Where's Hunt?MECHANICThere!

    NIKI looks up to see the name JAMES HUNT written on the black
    helmet roar out of the pits ahead, with new tyres on...NIKIC'mon...!!

    NIKI screams at the MECHANICS, who are struggling. The airguns
    make a high-pitched noise...something's not right.NIKIWhat's GOING ON???

    "Thump", new (slick) tyres hit the tarmac, engines scream, and
    NIKI exit the pits in pursuit of HUNT. But the delay has cost
    him dear...7   EXT. NUBURGRING - DAY                                             7Archive TV commentary from the world's race COMMENTATORS

    trying to catch JAMES HUNT, breaking as late as he can, engine
    screaming.(CONTINUED)58   CONTINUED:                                                       8He flies over the take-off hump between Pflanzgarten and
    Swallowtail - passes one car after another. Into 13th place
    now. Pulling off outrageous manoeuvres.

    NIKI's P.O.V: the world flies past in a blur. The steering
    wheel shakes. The car is right on the edge. Cannot be driven
    any harder.

    NIKI approaches the Streckenteil Adenauer-Brucke section of
    the course...turns left at the Bergwerk corner. Crazy speed.
    And tight. Too tight. A mistake...

    "Thump", his wheels come into contact with the kerb on the
    inside. NIKI tries to counter-steer, but is travelling at 155
    mph. The car jerks horribly to the right..

    "Crunch", hits the embankment, then "Bang", hits the barrier,
    and is thrown across the track..

    Fire breaks out in the engine. NIKI's eyes widen in horror,
    with another car bearing down upon him...NIKINo...!

    The oncoming car crashes head-on into our car, "Crash", a
    sickening, terrifying impact.

    The car explodes. Seventy litres of burning high-octane
    gasoline, with NIKI strapped inside, unable to undo his
    seatbelt. Locked in a blast furnace.

    NIKI screams as the flames engulf him. 800 degrees
    temperature. Trapped inside his car.

    Burning smoke fills his helmet, scarring his lungs...

    Pandemonium: commentary in different languages as panicked TV
    commentators helplessly describe what's happening..

    NIKI's POV: he can just make out the barely recognizable
    figures of the other DRIVERS rushing towards NIKI..

    Their hands get burnt in the flames as they try unsuccessfully
    to undo NIKI's seatbelt..

    Fire extinguishers blast at the car. Dry powder extinguishers.
    Covering NIKI's helmet. Blurring his vision, as he cries out
    in agony, inhaling the powder..

    Screaming voices. Panicked reactions. On the side of the car,
    the painted name `Niki Lauda' blisters and melts.(CONTINUED)68   CONTINUED: (2)                                                   8Then sound fades. As NIKI blacks out - losing consciousness.FADE TO BLACK:Over this: the sound of a ringing phone...9   INT. HOSPITAL A&E UNIT - (ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY) - DAY           9We're in a busy hospital A&E unit. Noise. Crowds. A regular
    Saturday late afternoon. The phone continues to ring..

    Finally, an attractive station NURSE in her 20's, run-off-her-
    feet, breathlessly picks up the phone.NURSEEmergency...

    She covers her ears, straining to hear, listening to what is
    being said. Then her expression changes...NURSEOkay...standing by!

    The NURSE hangs up...then calls out to her NURSE and DOCTOR
    colleagues...NURSEThat was the race-track..! There's
               been an accident..! A driver's been
               injured and is on his way in..!

    Instantly the atmosphere changes. A hive of activity as
    DOCTORS and NURSES prepare themselves for a major trauma...

    All PATIENTS with minor injuries are cleared out of the way.

    The NURSE rings upstairs to the operating theatres and
    consultant surgeons, telling them to stand by...CAPTION: "EIGHTY-EIGHT RACES EARLIER"Swing doors open, and a pair of shoeless, BARE FEET walks
    through and into the accident and emergency unit.

    Camera tilts up a pair of long legs in white racing
    overalls...to reveal a tall, good-looking driver, JAMES HUNT,
    (mid 20's), tanned, athletic, surfer long blonde hair...

    A man about whom a word comes to mind one would rarely use to
    describe an Englishman. SEXY.

    Blood trickles from his nose, there is bruising to his lip and
    the formation (already) of a nasty black eye, but make no
    mistake. He rocks. Drop-dead gorgeous..(CONTINUED)79    CONTINUED:                                                       9JAMESI think the racetrack telephoned ahead

     through, mid-embrace, tearing at one another's clothes...

     The apartment is basic. Cramped. Messy. Like that of a poor
     student. Ashtrays filled with half-smoked joints. Empty beer
     cans. A toaster. A kettle. A stereo. A cage containing two
     budgerigars.

     A mattress on the floor.

     Newspapers with headlines about the Dockers Strike, England's
     crumbling economy, Rolls Royce being bailed out by the
     government - subtle reminders of Britain in transition,
     leaving behind its strong, imperial past.

     JAMES and the NURSE stand against the wall, still half-
     dressed, but already passionately making love...JAMES (V/O)I have a theory why women like racing
                  drivers. It's not because they respect
                  what we do...driving round and round
                  in circles. Mostly they think that's
                  pathetic. And they're probably right..

     in the shower...JAMES (V/O)The closer you are to death, the more
                  alive you FEEL...the more alive you
                  ARE. And they can see that in you.

     JAMES and the NURSE arrive at Crystal Palace race track in his
     battered old mini. They get out. She looks up, seeing the
     mechanics, the racing teams, the cars..NURSEI've never been to a Grand Prix
                  before.JAMESYou still haven't. This is Formula 3.NURSEWhat's that?JAMESA lower division. Where people like me

                  Lotus twin-cam sixteen hundred engine.
                  She's no beauty. But goes like the
                  clappers.

     An odd-looking car. A bit like a giant Go-kart, blue with
     yellow strips along the side and James's name in small
     letters. It looks small, dangerously fragile.JAMESUuuurrrrrkkkkkkggghghhhh.

     JAMES goes to the NURSE...and kisses her full on the lips,

     NIKI gets there first. Up ahead though, approaching the second
     bend...JAMES sees the tiniest, slimmest crack to overtake. No
     right-minded driver would risk it. Only a suicidal maniac.

     car has 50 bhp more.

     And overtakes JAMES. NIKI begins to pull away. And has the
     Englishman beaten..

     JAMES sees red mist...and in an act of do-or-die vengeful
     madness, JAMES goes into a corner far too fast...

     car. An unforgivable act of unsportsmanlike vindictiveness.

     change gears, and continue driving...

     featured. Intelligent eyes. Dark hair. Protruding teeth.

                 two weeks before that race in Spain,
                 we put 20-inch rims on the rear
                 wheels. We get an extra half second

                 tells me we can't use those rims, they
                 make the car too wide. Against the
                 rules. So we go back to 19-inch rims
                 making the car slower again. Rules are
                 rules. For all of us. You're just a

                 perfect, so I called this meeting to
                 take a vote to cancel the race.

   A ripple of astonished reactions among the drivers..NIKIThere would be no change to the
                 situation as far as points is
                 concerned. The race would simply be
                 cancelled.

   TEDDY MAYER looks over at FERRARI representatives....MAYERThis is bullshit...

   Another DRIVER (GUY EDWARDS) gets to his feet...EDWARDSIf the race is cancelled, none of us
                 get our race fees...NIKIIt's true. You leave without your fee,
                 but you might leave with your LIFE.

   Another voice pierces the controversy...VOICEIt also means you would effectively
                 win the championship.

   It's JAMES HUNT, who is standing up...JAMESSo I can see why this suits you just
                 fine.NIKIWhy? There would be no points for me
                 either...(CONTINUED)73142 CONTINUED: (2)                                               142JAMESBut there would be one race less where
               I, or anyone else, could catch you.

   Uproar in the room...BRETT LUNGERJames is right! This is just tactics!ARTURO MERZARIOFerrari's dirty tricks! We've seen it
               before!HARALD ERTLMaybe it's just that he's frightened?

   Laughter among the DRIVERS...NIKIWhich asshole said this?

   Silence. No hand goes up. No one has the courage to own up.NIKIYes, I am frightened. Always a little
               bit when I race. I accept every time I
               get in my car there is 20% chance that
               I could die. But not one per cent
               more. And today, with the rain the
               risk IS more. How dare you accuse me
               of lack of courage? Let me remind you.
               I have the track record here. I am the
               only person in history to do the Ring
               in under 7 minutes. So actually it's
               to my ADVANTAGE to race here today.
               Because I'm quicker than all of you.

   A stunned silence. One voice pierces the room...JAMESFine. Then let's race!

   It's JAMES who stares at NIKI: a ripple of excitement and
   enthusiasm among the other drivers...JAMESThere's a hundred thousand fans out
               there who would never forgive us if we
               didn't.MERZARIOAnd some of us need our race fees!!(CONTINUED)74142 CONTINUED: (3)                                                142FIA OFFICIALAll those in favour of cancelling the
               race?

   JAMES puts his hand up. Clearly the more popular, charismatic
   figure among the DRIVERS, everyone else follows.FIA OFFICIALGentlemen, start your engines!!

   A clear victory for JAMES. He has swung the room.

   Everyone leaves the room. JAMES and TEDDY MAYER give one
   another a discreet hi-five...

   But we rack focus through the crowd to see NIKI staring at
   JAMES accusingly...holding his gaze.143 EXT. STARTING GRID - DAY                                       143"RRRROAAAR", an explosion of noise, as we widen and find

   His eyelids flicker. Thinking. Agonizing. Wrestling with an
   all important decision...

   Is it going to carry on raining? Or become dry?

   noise - no time to plug his headset in...(CONTINUED)75144 CONTINUED:                                                    144CALDWELLJochen's going on slicks. You want to

   JAMES looks in his wing-mirror back to his colleague, JOCHEN
   MASS's car, number 12, several rows behind him.

   White helmet. A team of Mclaren MECHANICS hastily changing the
   tyres to bald, dry tyres - ('slicks'). Then JAMES looks over
   at the car beside him...JAMESHas Niki changed?CALDWELLNo. He's going on wets.

   JAMES pulls down his visor...as he and NIKI's eyes meet for a
   split-second, then...

   The STARTER waves the flag. They're off!

   JAMES's foot hits the floor - his engine screams at almost
   9,000 rpms, drowning out the roar of the 180,000 crowd. The
   car is catapaulted forward, the wheel-spin leaving livid black
   scars on the asphalt..

   JAMES and NIKI both make good starts, and are neck and neck,
   but within seconds there's a McLaren right behind them,
   gaining fast.

   JAMES realizes it's his team-mate, JOCHEN MASS in a white
   helmet. Number 12. On his slick tyres.

   MASS was right to gamble on the track drying out. JAMES curses
   under his breath...JAMESShit...!

   JAMES screwed up. Made the wrong decision. He urgently needs
   to change tyres. With barely one lap completed...

   He swerves angrily into the pits..76145 INT. PITS - DAY                                                145Commentary from all the world's TV stations explaining the

   Everyone talking about NIKI's comeback.

   NIKI is in his car. The MECHANICS are talking to him in
   Italian...

   But NIKI hears nothing. He looks at the steering wheel, the
   shell of the car, the gear stick. And then we see..

   His hands are shaking violently. He's utterly terrified.

   NIKI attacks fearlessly. Despite terrible pain. NIKI moves to
   overtake JAMES.

   Utterly intimidated by NIKI's bravery, JAMES panics, and loses
   control of the car. He spins out..

   COMMENTATORS cannot believe their eyes. HUNT's blown it!
   LAUDA's overtaken him!

                 Means you're a fighter. That you never
                 give up. Behind my back I know some of
                 you guys call me `The Rat.' Because I
                 look like one. It's meant as an

   The plane load of JAMES's friends call out..."C'mon, James!"NIKIYou're right. I could learn from you.
               In hospital the toughest part of my
               treatment was the vacuum. Pumping the
               shit out of my lungs. It was agony.
               While doing it, I was watching
               television...you winning all those
               races...and I was cursing you.. "That
               bastard, Hunt", I would shout, "I hate
               that guy." one day the doctor said,
               "Mr. Lauda, may I offer one piece of
               advice? Stop thinking of it as a curse
               to have been given an enemy in life.
               It can be a blessing, too." I said,
               "Who are you, Confucius?" He said, "A
               wise man gets more from his enemies
               than a fool from his friends." And you
               know, he's right. Look at us. We were
               a pair of kids when we first met.
               Hotheaded jerks in Formula 3. Headed
