    sees very well dressed well-to-do Osage greeting their
    families and getting into beautiful cars. We see four or five
    poor sketchy characters who are loitering around the station
    looking hungrily at the well-to-do Osage. Ernest reacts. Then
    a fight breaks out. Ernest skirts around it and through the

              all over the place and screaming
              like animals.

              This is a cattle ranch. There's no
              oil here. So I'm settled with no
              fear.

              out, this wealth will run dry drier

      COUPLE moving through the dancers with JOHN WREN (part-Ute)
      bringing him to meet a few Osage Council Members who are
      chatting with Mollie's Catholic Priest. At first cautious,
      Wren then receives a warm welcome.OSAGE COUPLEThis here's John Wren. Friend of

      and skittish to report news of Tom White. Hale has just
      finished dancing, out of breath, taking a seat. Ernest grabs
      Bill Hale tries to take him to the side.

      Hale agitated sees his manner and tells him to stop and
      settle himself.

      Things get heated. Hale loses his cool and grabs him by the
      back of the neck like a child and squeezes, pushes him down,
      pushes his face into his own knees.   This is noticed by some
      people. The couple with John Wren and the Council member(s)
      witness it. It's over as soon as it started, Hale hoping to
      make it all go away.

      Ernest settles down, says a few words more but is cut off by
