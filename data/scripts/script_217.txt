     are unhung pictures and a few other items that indicate he
     has just moved into this job.4Two other senior CIA officials sit in on the meeting.
Kramer looks at a file on Bourne and Abbott.BOURNE (V.O.)So we got in the way?   Is that
          why Neski died? Is that why you
          killed Marie?

Kramer glances at a photo of Marie in the file.ABBOTT (V.O.)You killed Marie the minute you
          climbed into her car.   The
          minute you entered her life she
          was dead!

Kramer looks at Abbott's official photo.BOURNE (V.O.)I told you people to leave me
          alone! I fell off the grid. I
          was half way around the world.ABBOTT (V.O.)There's no place it won't catch
          up to you. It's how every story
          ends. It's what you are, Jason.
          A killer! You always will be.THUMP!CRONINWe think that's Bourne hitting
          him on the head and then--

to Abbott's head.ABBOTT (V.O.)Go ahead!     Go on! Do it!BOURNE (V.O.)She wouldn't want me to. That's
          the only reason your alive.

Landy nods.   Kramer shakes his head in disgust at the whole
situation.KRAMERBourne's last confirmed location

          gotten his memory back yet.  Not
          all of it.

A look from Kramer...KRAMERPam, what I need to know is, what
          kind of a threat is he to us?LANDYIf he just wanted to hurt us he
          could have sent this tape to CNN.KRAMERMaybe he still will. Maybe he
          gave it to you because he wants
          to throw you in the opposite
          direction of his real plan. I
          don't know. I just know my
          number one rule is "the only way
          to stay safe is to assume the
          worst."   As far as I'm concerned
          Bourne is a serious threat until

      third, setting off their alarms.

      The fourth window Bourne smashes in doesn't set off an
      alarm. Bourne pulls the door open and climbs in.

      Inside the car Bourne reaches under the dash and yanks
      handful of wires off the steering column and starts to
      expertly hotwire the car.263   INT. VOSEN'S SUV -- DAY                                       263TACTICAL TEAM LEADER(into radio)

      A CRI car gets to the roof.   Two agents come from the
      elevator lobby.   The three car alarms distract them. They
      search for Bourne, but can't find him at first...

      Bourne gets the car engine on - but, given the wonders of
      modern anti-theft technology his steering wheel is still
      locked.84A second CRI car arrives.

      Bourne slams the car into low gear and backs up at high
      speed.

      He smashes into the car across the aisle from him. With a
      sharp metallic snap the wheel in Bourne's car is suddenly
      free, he jams the car into drive pulls out into lane and
      stops.

      Three CRI cars here now. Two head straight for him.   A
      third blocks the exit ramp.

      Bourne checks the rearview and sees two more agents pour
      from the elevator lobby, one carrying the serious firepower
      of an M-4 (an M-16 variant whose bullets can penetrate
      metal and concrete). They move into position to get a bead
      on him.

      Bourne assesses. But he doesn't move. The agents swarm
      toward him. What the hell is he doing? Why is he waiting?267   INT. VOSEN'S SUV -- DAY                                        267TACTICAL TEAM LEADERWe've got him! He's got nowhere

      The agents open fire.

      Bourne ducks the lead slugs ripping through the windshield.
      But there's no dodging the shower of broken glass.

      As Bourne disappears below the dashboard, the CRI agent
      adjusts his fire into the car's grill.

      Virtually blind, Bourne races the hard-pressed vehicle
      backwards as the agent's fire decimates the car's
      driveline.

      Bourne slips the car into neutral and takes a quick peek
      behind him.85Steers still speeding but quickly dying car towards a small
      gap between two parked cars at the edge of the parking
      structure.

      Bourne's car splits the gap between the parked cars, hits
      the base of a low angled wall that slams the back of his
      car up and over the wall.

      Bourne is pounded as his car jounces onto the wall, a
      second later the front end seesaws over the top, the sudden
      angle change exposes for an instant the bottom of Bourne's
      car, to the shooters.

      Several rounds rip through the floorboard and tear past
      Bourne's head just before his car drops upside down for 25
      feet and slams onto a row of parked cars.

      The impact rips Bourne from the seat and slams him hard
      against the roof.

        pulls him from his car and races away as the agent from the

        Bourne's race to the exit is cut off as a 3rd CRI sedan
        slides into view and it's occupants open fire on Bourne in
        a head on charge.

        The just stolen vehicle takes heavy fire as Bourne reacts
        instantaneously; thumbing on the cruise control,
        shouldering his door open, and slamming the gas pedal to
        the floor as he dives out of the car.

        The agents react as Bourne's sedan torpedoes them head on.
        Hit hard they're taken out of the fight as metal collapses,
        glass shatters, and airbags explode.

        Bourne tumbles to a stop at the rear of a parked car as his
        car implodes against the oncoming agents.87Instantly Bourne is on his feet, moving between the parked
cars to engage another CRI sedan traveling parallel to the
course of the wrecked one.

The agents in this sedan are distracted by the still
echoing crash and are caught off-guard as Bourne steps out
and points his gun at the driver.

The driver ducks and floors his gas pedal in a desperate
effort to save his own life. As the sedan suddenly
accelerates, Bourne deliberately shifts his aim to the
sedan's front tire and fires.

The tire explodes and the car suddenly veers left and slams
into a parked car, pitching the driver violently against
the unyielding interior of the sedan.

An instant later Bourne rips the radio off the dazed
drivers belt just before he cold cocks him with it.

With the wreck still echoing through the garage Bourne has
to deal with the arrival of the first NYPD sedan.

Bourne takes on the persona of an alarmed witness as the on
edge cop climbs out of his car but Bourne's performance is
cut short as the agent running from his drop from the roof,
arrives and opens fire.

The police officer goes down in the hail of gunfire as
Bourne turns and expertly drops the gunman with a single
shot.

The increasing volume of squealing tires alerts Bourne to a
new threat, he pulls the officer into some cover and grabs
the officer's radio.BOURNE10-13. Shots fired. Officer
          down. Port Authority parking

radio back.BOURNE (CONT'D)Stay out of sight until one of

Bourne disappears.

We pick him up as he jumps into the cops car and guns the

CRI agents are confused for a second -- until they pick up
the NYPD car exiting Port Authority on one of the ramps.
But that's all the time Bourne needs--88276    OMITTED                                                      276277    EXT. CROSSTOWN STREET -- DAY                                 277Bourne turns on his lights and siren and speeds east,

       As cars yield to Bourne's siren a taxi tries to jump into
       Bourne's wake but a CRI sedan punches the taxi back to the
       right. It ricochets off several parked cars before
       regaining control.277A   OMITTED                                                  277A280    OMITTED                                                      280281    EXT. CROSSTOWN STREET -- DAY                                 281Bourne struggles to keep his over-matched vehicle ahead of
       the more powerful CRI Sedan which tries to spin Bourne out
       by hitting his bumper.

       Bourne tacks right quickly and barely avoids a stopped car.
       The CRI sedan flanking Bourne's slams into the rear of that
       car, spinning it 180 degrees into the path of the trailing
       CRI sedan which destroys itself in the resulting collision
       and blocks the path of the other CRI sedan.282    INT. BOURNE'S CAR -- DAY                                     282Bourne is home free. He looks around and spots a sign that
       indicates a right turn and says "To Holland Tunnel / US
       95." Bourne turns right--

       Suddenly the window next to his head explodes as two more
       shots rip through his door to tear a jagged wound into the
       top of Bourne's leg.

       Bourne's car crosses in front of a small car stopped at the
       intersection Paz swerves his car into that car and punches
       it into the side of Bourne's car.

       Bourne's car is knocked spinning, Paz keeps charging
       forward and slams into the back of Bourne's car. With his
       front tires spinning wildly Bourne fights to straighten his
       car as another CRI sedan appears and tries to box Bourne's
       car by sliding into his path.283    OMITTED                                                      28389284    EXT. MANHATTAN STREET -- DAY                                  284Bourne just manages to punch his car into the right rear of
       the CRI Sedan and race down the Avenue with Paz and the
       slightly damaged sedan in pursuit.

       Paz gains on him and Bourne is forced to swerve violently
       to deny Paz the kill shot he is all too capable of.

       Just ahead of Bourne, two government SUVs slide into the
       intersection completely blocking his path.

       Bourne instantly spins his car 180 degrees and continues
       on, barreling into the roadblock backwards.

       As Bourne's car plows through the SUV's he whips the wheel
       and his car spins through a reverse 180 as Paz and the
       other sedan race through the wreckage in Bourne's wake.

       Paz and the CRI sedan are all over Bourne as he slides a
       right hand turn onto South St. as Paz and the CRI sedan
       overwhelm Bourne's battered vehicle.284A   OMITTED                                                    284A287    INT. BOURNE'S CAR -- DAY                                      287On his police radio, Bourne singles out an NYPD officer
       (call sign Alpha-2503) racing toward the intersection just
       ahead.

       Bourne slows, then speeds up quickly to time it right:

       The CRI car almost hits his bumper, then has to accelerate
       through the upcoming intersection. As he does, the cop car
       Bourne was listening to on the radio slams broadside into
       the CRI sedan drafting the bumper of the mangled cop car.

       Swerving wildly Paz avoids the pileup and slams his heavy
       SUV into the back of Bourne's car, pushing him into the
       oncoming traffic.

       Several cars swerve left and right as Paz pushes Bourne
       sideways onto the ramped end of a K-Rail dividing the
       street ahead.

       The nearly upended car grinds down the K-Rail until the
       rear of Bourne's car strikes an obstruction which punches
       it back into the lane as it slams against the front of
       Paz's SUV, knocking the SUV sideways, into a row of parked
       cars.
