                               Spike JonzeINT. UNKNOWN SPACEClose on THEODORE'S face (30s). We hold on him for a long
time. He's looking at something off camera, deep in thought.
He starts quietly dictating a love letter into a small
microphone.THEODORETo my Chris, I have been thinking
          about how I could possibly tell you
          how much you mean to me. I remember
          when I first started to fall in
          love with you like it was last
          night. Lying naked beside you in
          that tiny apartment, it suddenly
          hit me that I was part of this
          whole larger thing, just like our
          parents, and our parents' parents.
          Before that I was just living my
          life like I knew everything, and
          suddenly this bright light hit me
          and woke me up. That light was you.

Theodore, searching for the right words, quietly enjoys
writing the letter. As he continues, he is moved by the
memories he's describing.THEODORE (CONT'D)I can't believe it's already been
          50 years since you married me. And
          still to this day, every day, you
          make me feel like the girl I was
          when you first turned on the lights
          and woke me up and we started this
          adventure together. Happy
          Anniversary, my love and my friend
          til the end. Loretta. Print.

Cut out to reveal a computer monitor he's sitting at. On the
screen we see the letter he's been dictating, transcribed
into a handwritten letter on blue stationery.

As he says "Loretta," we see "Loretta" being handwritten at
the bottom of the letter. He proofreads his letter. Also on
the screen are photos of a couple in their 80s. The couple is
tagged "Chris" and "Me - Loretta." Underneath is a bullet
point email from Loretta: anniversary letter to husband
Chris, married fifty years, love of my life, met right after
college, have had the greatest life together.

Theodore pushes print and the letter comes out on a beautiful
robin's egg blue piece of stationery, with ball point pen
handwritten older-female cursive. He looks at it, not happy.(CONTINUED)Her                                                          pg. 2CONTINUED:He puts the printed letter on a stack of other printed

              I that I met you fifty years ago?

We track off of Theodore, down a line of cubicles, hearing
bits of letters being written and seeing photos of who
they're being written to on the screens.MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN LETTER WRITERDear Nana, Thank you so much for my
              truck. I love the color and I play

              truck I've ever seen. Love, Tommy.

We see photos of Tommy and Nana on the screen, and five-year
old hand writing. Moving off of her, we find another letter

               minute and relax. And so we argued
               for ten minutes about that and
               about how he's just trying to make
               our house a home. I say he's

            her behind, but she's totally
            amazing, you know. She's so smart.
            She doesn't see things only in
            black and white. She sees this
            whole gray area and she's really
            helping me explore it. You know, we
            bonded really quickly and at first
            I thought it was because she was
            programmed to be that way, but I
            don't think that's how they work.

            Well, so to speak, yes. She really
            turns me on. And I think I turn her
            on. I don't know, unless she's

            anybody that falls in love is a
            freak. It's a crazy thing to do in

                here thinking about all the things
                I wanted to apologize to you for.
                All the pain we caused each other,
                everything I put on you -
                everything I needed you to be or

                that. I will always love you

  He looks out the window. The sky is starting to change. He
  stares at the purple glow on the horizon.

  cold metal hand rail. His bare feet and the sound they make
  on the unfinished cement. Amy's hair as she's hit with wind
  when she opens the door to the outside.EXT. APARTMENT ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUSTheodore leads Amy onto the roof. The city is absolutely
  quiet. The sun isn't up yet. The city is just beginning to be
  lit with the earliest morning blue/purple hue.

  They wander around the roof separately, lost in thought,
  taking in the city. He breathes in the cold morning air. He
  stares at small details: a tattered inspection tag tied to a
  water meter, flapping in the wind; a lone car driving down a
  boulevard ten blocks away; a dirty abandoned sock.

  Eventually he sits down next to Amy and she puts her hand on
  his hand. He puts his other hand on top of her hand. He looks
  at their hands together and rubs her skin with his thumb. He
  looks out at the city and exhales. The sun is just starting
  to break. She puts her head on his shoulder. They watch as
  hundreds of birds fly around the nearby rooftops and disperse
  off into the city.FADE OUT.
