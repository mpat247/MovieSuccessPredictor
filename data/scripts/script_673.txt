You wanna be a detective? Here's what you
do: Take a trusted friend, and imagine the
worst thing, the most despicable thing, the
thing it would never even cross their minds
to do. Then assume they've already done it
twice.

When you consider that a career in pro foot-
ball means maybe ten years, after which you
got no legs left, and during which you're a
painkiller drug addict, a million a year
sounds about right. So when people bitch
at me about the money I made, I have a pat
response: Go fuck yourself.

A big MAN lies, shirtless, on the bed.
Watching a sports program. We hear:SPORTS FIGURE (V.O.)(on TV)
           Eliminating the draft? Worst
           thing ever happened to pro
           football. Already you got Eric
           Dickerson, no team's good enough
           for him... You got Dion Sanders,
           this guy, Bosworth, bunch of
           peacocks. Nagurski, I saw him
           play for 25 bucks a game. And he
           woulda played for free, you get
           me? He loved the game. Nowadays?
           Forget about it.
The TELEPHONE SHRILLS in the stillness.
The Man On the Bed answers it. Speaks haltingly.MAN ON BEDHello...?MALE (V.O.)Hello, Billy.    Do you know who
           this is?
Silence.MALE (V.O.)Kid from Ohio is looking real
           good, Billie...
The Man's hand unclenches. A container of pills spills
over the blanket. He stammers:MAN ON BEDI'm... I'm gonna... try real
           hard...MALE (V.O.)No, Billy. What you're gonna do
           ... is rush for 150 yards against
           Chicago.MAN ON BEDThat's... too much. I can't...(CONTINUED)2.CONTINUED:MALE (V.O.)You can. And you  will. This is a
         business, Billy.  You don't make

         steps in. No more  job... and no
         more pills, Billy.MAN ON BEDPlease... Just give me time...MALE (V.O.)One hundred and fifty yards.
         Goodbye.
The PHONE CLICKS off. NFL running back Billy Cole stares
straight ahead, mouth working spastically.CUT TO:AERIAL SHOT - SNOWSTORMOVER Chicago, Illinois, as the CAMERA SPIRALS DOWN TOWARD
a teeming football stadium. We hear crowd noise and
marching band music, deafeningly loud, as we SUPERIMPOSE
the legend:SOLDIER FIELD, CHICAGO   NOVEMBER 14INT. ANNOUNCER'S BOOTHThe BROADCAST TEAM huddles inside the quilted jackets,
squinting through the snow. Speaking into headset mikes.ANNOUNCERGood afternoon and welcome to
         Soldier Field, Chicago, site of
         today's confrontation between the
         L.A. Stallions and the Chicago
         Bears. This is Vern Lindquist
         with Terry Bradshaw, and, yes, my
         friends, it is that cold.INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAME TIMEBilly Cole sits, alone, in front of his locker.
Eyes glazed. Face bathed in sweat.
He takes a bottle of pills from the locker. Pops three.
Hisses a stream of air through his teeth as we --CUT TO:3.EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY (FOURTH QUARTER)A deafening CRUNCH as a defensive back hammers a wide
receiver, nearly decapitates him. The ball rolls free.
The back recovers it.ANNOUNCER (V.O.)... Big Ray Walton puts a
         devastating hit on Bricmont, so
         Chicago turns over the ball with a
         minute and forty seconds left.EXT. SIDELINES - SAME TIMEThe injured player goes by on a stretcher, moaning.
Cheerleaders jump and frolic.BILLY COLEgets up off the bench. The rest of the offensive unit
sprints onto the field. Cole walks. Straight ahead,
eyes front. Like a robot. His HEARTBEAT THUDS on the
soundtrack.COLOR MAN (V.O.)And so L.A. has a chance to ice
         the game, no pun intended... And
         you gotta be thinking, give the
         ball to Billy Cole. He has had an
         outstanding day, racking up 138
         yards against a tough defense.DOWN ON FIELDThe huddle breaks.
The L.A. team trudges through the snow to the line of
scrimmage.
Cole adopts a three-point stance.
Everything happens in hyper-real SLOW MOTION:
The snow falls. The receivers breeze past, in motion to
begin their patterns. Moving like gazelles.
Cole's fingers paw the cold earth. Gouging it.
He is like a spring. Coiled and ready.
The ball is snapped.
Turf and snow. Erupting.
A firecracker series of POPS as linemen collide.
Legs churning.(CONTINUED)4.CONTINUED:The ball floats through the snowy air. Pitch-out to
Cole.
He takes it on the run. Tucks it under his arm.
Behind him, the quarterback bites the dust, leveled.
Cole turns the corner. Picks up a blocker.
Feet pounding. Arms pumping.
Up ahead, the free safety barrels toward him.    Low and
hard.
Cole does not blink. He reaches beneath his jersey.
Pulls out a GUN.
Pumps THREE SHOTS into the free safety's head.

The bullets go straight through. On the back of his
helmet.
A mixture of blood and fiberglass.
Cole keeps going, jogging for the end zone.
Around him, sound. Fury. Impact. Confusion.
Another defensive back. Straight ahead.
Reacts with almost comical terror. Dives to one side.
Cole FIRES. Blows out the guy's knee. Ends a career.
Keeps going.
We are now in full-scale panic.
The players are fleeing the field. Shouts. Pandemonium.
A few brave men gather around the fallen players.POLICEare on the field now. Running full out. They've got
riot guns, cocked and locked. Sprinting through the
snow.
Cole crosses the goal line.   Touchdown.
Drops the ball.
Turns, facing the cops.   His eyes are insane.
The crowd is screaming. People are running back and
forth like extras in the Keystone Cops.
The first TWO BLASTS from the cops' RIOT GUNS go high and
wide. One SHOT BLOWS APART the base of the goalpost.
The forty-foot-high monument pitches over, collapsing
like a wounded giant. Lands in a shower of snow and ice.
Cole is oblivious to the bars crashing around him.    He
smiles and says:(CONTINUED)5.CONTINUED:COLEI'm going to Disneyland...
Puts the GUN to his helmet.   FIRES.CUT TO:EXT. L.A. STREET - IN SHADOW OF FREEWAY - MORNINGWe SUPERIMPOSE the legend:WEST LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA    DECEMBER 20Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. America, and all the ships at
sea. Welcome to another lackluster morning in Southern
California. Palm trees limp. Windless silence. 80
degrees at 8:00 AM.
CAMERA CRANES DOWN PAST a huge, rotting billboard. On
the billboard, a girl in tight jeans. Grabbing her own
butt. A surprised look on her face. Yes, honey, that's
your butt.
MOVE IN ON a tiny, weather-beaten bungalow. In the
shadow of the 405 Freeway. A shingle hangs from a
wrought iron post: JOSEPH R. HALLENBECK, CONFIDENTIALINVESTIGATIONS.On the lawn, a late-model Plymouth.
The sprinkers come to life. Fling water across the car.ANOTHER ANGLEInside the car, a lone man is asleep, arms akimbo.
Sprawled across the seat. Half-empty bottle of Seagrams
V.O. RADIO on, playing tinny JAZZ music.
Picture the  tiredest, meanest, grouchiest son of a bitch
self-hating  loser you can.
Now give him  a two-year-old suit from C & R Clothing.
Such is the  aforementioned HALLENBECK.ANOTHER ANGLETHREE neighborhood KIDS have gathered around the car.
Enjoying the spectacle of a sleeping drunk.
One tosses a baseball from hand to hand. One picks his
nose.(CONTINUED)6.CONTINUED:KID #1Dude's trashed.KID #2Shit, we should do something to
         him.
Kid #3 continues mining for nose eggs.   It looks like his
entire fist is up there. Pause, then:KID #3I know where there's a dead
         squirrel.ANOTHER ANGLE - BUNDLE OF PAPER TOWELS - SOME MINUTESLATERwith a tail sticking out.
The youngest Kid holds it aloft reverently.
Looks in the open car window at Hallenbeck.
Still snoozing.   Dead to the world.KID #1Do it.
They heave the squirrel into the car and run away.
A pause. Another pause.    The sprinkler goes round.
Nothing happens.ANOTHER ANGLEHallenbeck snores. The mashed squirrel perches on his
chest. A shadow falls across him as --KIDSreturn, scratching their heads.   Staring in at him.KID #2Goddamn.   Dude's trashed.KID #3Take his bottle.
Kid #1 smiles nervously.   Reaches in with infinite
patience.
Trembling hand inches closer and closer --
And closes on the bottle as, without warning --7.HALLENBECKsits bolt upright and grabs the Kid and stuffs a .38
revolver in the Kid's face and cocks it.HALLENBECKHey, motherfucker.
The Kid, of course, shrieks.
And the light of sanity dawns in Hallenbeck's eyes.
He sucks in a deep breath. Releases the struggling Kid.
Swears under his breath. Watches    the boys flee in
terror. Notices a dead squirrel    in his lap. Scowls.
Heaves it out the window. Pumps    a Camel into his mouth.
Lights it. Rescues the bottle of    Seagrams.

Thus begins his morning.
He opens the car door. The sprinkler douses him.
He gets out. Stands on the lawn.
One of the Kids, the toughest one, is standing on the
sidewalk.KID #3I'm not scared.
Hallenbeck scowls.HALLENBECKYou're on my property, kid.KID #3Sidewalk belongs to the
         government.
Hallenbeck stares at him.   Smiles weakly.HALLENBECKExcuse me.
He leans over and vomits on the lawn.
One hand gripping the car fender.
The sprinkler goes round and round.EXT. MALIBU BEACH FRONT - MORNINGA redwood beach house, mellow in the morning sun.
There was a party here last night.
Banners. Balloons and streamers. Tawdry in the light of
day.8.INT. BEACH HOUSE - SAME TIMEA plush bedroom.   Sun streams in the window.
A YOUNG MAN sits, straddling a backwards chair.     Bare-
foot, bare-chested. Blond hair, perfect tan.
He is nursing a beer.   Smoking and staring at --BEDwhere a tawny golden girl lies, serene and innocent.
Like a sleeping kitten. Rumpled sheets, one breast
exposed. No tan line.
The man takes a drag off the cigarette, studies the
sleeping girl. Meet Jimmy Dix. Twenty-seven years old,
former National League heartthrob.
He shakes his head and mutters:JIMMY (YOUNG MAN)Jesus, kid, if only you weren't so
         damn ugly.
He gets up and goes into the head. Pulls out a glass
vial. Dips a coke spoon with practiced ease. Sucks it
up a nostril.
For one moment, he catches his own eye in the mirror.FLASH CUT TO:FLASHBACK - FOOTBALL FIELDSeventy thousand people screaming.
Jimmy in the middle. Younger Jimmy.    Fresher Jimmy.
It's a night game at the Coliseum.   He's the quarterback.
The snap. Jimmy fakes the draw. Rolls right.      Around
him, all is impact. Sound and fury.
He targets a receiver and unleashes a rocket.   Sixty-
yard toss, hits the guy between the numbers.JIMMY'S FACECovered with dirt and mud. Blood, too.
Young and proud. Seventy thousand voices tell him he's
alive. He makes a difference.9.BACK TO PRESENTAlone in the bathroom... leaning on the counter.    Head
down. A voice calls softly from the bedroom:SLEEPY VOICE (O.S.)Jimmy, are you still here...?
Pause, then:JIMMYI don't know.
He looks up at his reflection. Glazed eyes, beard
stubble. Crows' feet around the eyes.JIMMYYeah.    I guess I am.
He sniffs, clearing his nose.INT. WEST L.A. BUNGALOW - MORNINGHallenbeck opens the door and shambles in.
Dark. Depressing. Sprawl of furniture. Stack after
stack of sports magazines. Drop all your belongings out
of a plane. They will land like this.
He flicks on the light. Crosses to the couch and flops
down. Plucks a bottle of aspirin from an end table.
Next to the bottle, we see --TWO FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHSside by side. In one, younger Hallenbeck is kissing
younger bride. Smiling.
In the other, the President of the United States presents
Hallenbeck with a medal. They are both smiling beneath
the Presidential Seal.BACK TO SCENEHallenbeck scowls and chews three aspirin.    Swallows.
The PHONE RINGS. He groans. Chain-lights another smoke,
stubs out his old one. Chins the receiver and says:HALLENBECKHallenbeck Investigations.(CONTINUED)10.CONTINUED:MALE (V.O.)Hey, Joe, Mike Miller over at

Hallenbeck catches his reflection in the mirror over
the TV. His face is ashen grey. Hollow eye sockets.
Blotchy skin.HALLENBECKGimmee the address.EXT. BUNGALOW - MORNINGHallenbeck emerges into the blinding glare. His tie is
crooked. His cuffs are too short. He looks like a
grouchy bear.
He looks up at the girl on the billboard.HALLENBECK'Morning, gorgeous.
Gorgeous does not respond:   Coy.   Very coy.
Hallenbeck slides behind the wheel of his Plymouth.     KEYS

looks at himself in the mirror.(CONTINUED)12.CONTINUED:HALLENBECK(softly)

Pulls out into the street. Off he goes.CUT TO:INT. MALIBU BEACH HOUSE - MORNINGJimmy Dix leaves the bedroom. Pads barefoot down a hall
littered with beer cans, food wrappers. A sleeping guy.
Stops at a door, peeks in: all-night poker game in
progress. Four bleary-eyed men. Unshaven. Stack of
wrinkled money on a card table.JIMMY'Morning, boys.
They all grunt. One of them, name of HENRY, looks up at
him. Holds out a half-smoked doobie:HENRYHey, Jimmy.   You want some of
         this?JIMMYNo, man. Why do you think they
         call it dope?
                (beat)
         Henry, did I do anything last night
         that I should know about?HENRYYou puked a couple times. Pointed
         at some lady's tits. Chased a dog

Everyone plays cards.    No one looks at him.   He frowns.
Leaves.INT. LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATERJimmy is seated in the devastated living room. Putting
on shoes. He hears a COMMOTION outside: A woman scream-
ing. Water splashing. He frowns, puzzled. Gets up.
Pads out onto a redwood deck.EXT. REDWOOD DECK - SAMEA six-foot behemoth is seated in a jacuzzi at the far end
of the deck. He is dunking a terrified female head under
the water and laughing.
Jimmy clears his throat.(CONTINUED)14.CONTINUED:JIMMYHo.    Ray.
The MAN looks up, annoyed.RAY (MAN)What the fuck you want, Jimmy?JIMMYWhat's with the girl?
She surfaces, sputtering and screaming.   Ray thrusts her
beneath the surface again.RAYBitch won't blow me.JIMMY(pause, then)
         Too early in the morning, Ray.
         Let her go.RAYFuck you. She's not coming up

Jimmy swallows hard.   Says:JIMMYRay.   Let her go.RAYFuck   you, loser. What are you doing
         at a   league party, asshole? You and

Jimmy controls himself with an effort.JIMMYRay, she's gonna drown.RAYNot if she blows me.
Jimmy's eyes are smoldering. He steps to the right.
Casually scoops up a football lying on the deck.JIMMYLast chance, Ray.RAYGo spit.(CONTINUED)15.CONTINUED:JIMMYFine.
Jimmy turns, as if to walk away.
Instead, he spins back and launches the football.
It sings, that's how hard he throws it. And when it
smacks Ray in the face, something breaks. It ain't the
ball.
The big man howls. Clutching his flattened nose.
The girl comes up for air. Gagging and choking.
Jimmy is at her side instantly. Pulls her out of the
water.JIMMYGet out of here. Go.
She goes. He leans over and grabs Ray by the hair.
The guy is bleeding. Delirious.
Jimmy yanks until their faces are inches apart.JIMMYBest arm in the National League,
         you son of a bitch. Remember that.
He lets go. Ray sags, semi-conscious.
The poker players come running as Jimmy walks back inside.EXT. COAST HIGHWAY - DAYJimmy gets into the car. Takes out his vial.
Spoons some powder, sucks it up.
A voice in the background: "Hey, someone shit on my car!"EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAYJoe Hallenbeck slides his Plymouth to the curb in front
of a cozy stucco dwelling. Gets out, crosses the lawn.
A fat NEIGHBOR is watering shrubs next door. He waves.NEIGHBOR'Morning, Joe, how's it going?HALLENBECKMy ears are burning, Andy. Even
         as we speak, someone, somewhere is

doorway. Wearing a terry cloth robe. This is Joe's wifeSARAH.SARAHI thought you were in Las Vegas.HALLENBECKI was.SARAHWhere did you sleep?HALLENBECKOffice.
He brushes past her and crosses to the bed.   On the pillow,
a big stuffed cat toy smiles benignly.HALLENBECKHey, Furry Tom.
He sits on the bed. Lights a cigarette. Opens the night
stand and removes a speedloader for his .38. Starts to
load the gun.SARAHHow much did you lose?HALLENBECKI wasn't there to gamble.    I was
         doing a skip trace.SARAHHow much did you lose?HALLENBECKFifty bucks.
He suddenly notices a sheet of paper on the night stand.
A crayon sketch. He picks it up, frowns:HALLENBECKWhat's this?SARAHDarian's class drew holiday
         pictures. That was hers. Her
         teacher wants to see us, Joe.17.CLOSE ON DRAWINGIt's a picture   of Santa Claus,  except this Santa has long,

Her voice is ice cold.    Joe turns and regards her levelly.HALLENBECKYou okay, Sarah...?SARAHI'm tense. I couldn't get to
         sleep last night.HALLENBECKHmmmm. Well, I think the kid
         will be fine. Boys still tease

         time she's fourteen.SARAHWatch your Goddamn mouth, Joe.HALLENBECKWell, Christ, you let her wear
         enough makeup. The kid looks like
         a goddamn raccoon. She comes in
         late at night, I think, 'Christ,

         twice.SARAHYou're not funny. All the girls
         at that school wear makeup.(CONTINUED)18.CONTINUED:HALLENBECKYeah, but they don't apply it with

He tosses the holstered .38 on the bed.   Stalks into
the bathroom.INT. BATHROOMHALLENBECKDamn raccoon.
He sighs, tosses his cigarette butt in the toilet.
Walks back out into the bedroom.INT. BEDROOMHe kneels, looks under the bed.
Frowns.
Straightens and says, very conversationally:HALLENBECKWho's the guy in the closet?
Sarah stops dead.   Spins and stares at him.SARAHExcuse me?HALLENBECK(frowns)

         forget that I'm a detective.
                (lights a cigarette)
         See, first I noticed how tense you
         were, but I let that pass. Then
         I noticed there was steam in the
         shower like someone was just in
         there, but meanwhile your hair is
         completely dry, you follow? So.
         Why the steamy shower?(MORE)(CONTINUED)19.CONTINUED:HALLENBECK (CONT'D)Because someone else was in there,
         right, and since he's not under
         the bed you must have stuck him in
         the closet when you heard my key in
         the door a day early. Tah-dah.
         Please, no applause.
A silence hangs between them.    Sarah just stares.   Shakes
her head.SARAHWell, nothing changes.    You're
         still a lunatic.HALLENBECKMmmmm. I'm sorry, honey, I don't
         enjoy being observant, but someone's

         his name?SARAHYou want me to open the closet, Joe?
         Huh? You want me to indulge your
         fucking paranoia, I'll throw the

         we'll both know you're a psycho,
         is that what you want? Huh??
An awkward pause.   Finally Hallenbeck scowls and says:HALLENBECKNo.   We won't open the door.SARAHThank you.(CONTINUED)20.CONTINUED:HALLENBECK(sighs)
         Nope. Door stays shut. Instead,
         what I'm gonna do is...

         then I'm gonna put a bullet in

He cocks the hammer.   Arm extended, hand rock steady.SARAHCall your shrink, Joe. I still
         have the number. Call him and tell
         him you're losing it, I cannot
         fucking deal with you like this -- !HALLENBECKThree.   Last chance.SARAHJoe, dammit -- !
He sighs. Starts to pull the trigger.    And Sarah
screams --SARAHJesus, no -- !
And grabs the gun.
Everything freezes. She looks at him.    He looks at her.
Understanding occurs.CLOSET DOORswings slowly open, then...
And out steps a man in a bathrobe.
Compact. Wiry. Hair still soaking wet.
None other than MIKE MILLER, Joe's early morning phone call.
We know this because Joe says:(CONTINUED)21.CONTINUED:HALLENBECKHello, Mike.   Keeping her warm
         for me?
The gun barrel does not waver.    Not an inch.MILLEREasy, Joe.   Don't do nothing dumb.HALLENBECKHow as she, Mike? On your finger
         scale, how was my wife...?MILLERIt just happened, Joe.     It just

         You knew?HALLENBECKI suspected. So how about it, Mike?
         On a scale of one to ten. How was
         she?MILLERJoe, come on, how long we been
         friends, huh?HALLENBECKHow long? Mmm. I'd say roughly
         until you put your dick in my
         wife.(CONTINUED)22.CONTINUED:MILLERYou gotta understand --HALLENBECKI know, I know, it just happened.
           It was an accident. Sure. You
           tripped. You said, 'Whoops,' and
           accidentally fucked my wife. Gee,

Sarah speaks then.   Head down.   Eyes averted.SARAHPut the gun down.HALLENBECKHmmm?  Oh, right, the gun.
                  (sighs)
           You're right, Sarah, I'm acting nuts.
He pulls the trigger.
The SHOT is DEAFENING in the closed room.
Mike Miller screams and clutches at himself.
The bullet goes high and wide. Over his head.
On the wall is a framed wedding photo. The twin of the
one in Hallenbeck's office. The bullet strikes it dead
center.
Blows it to pieces.
Silence. The tinkle of glass hitting the floor.
Hallenbeck turns. Regards his wife with hooded, lifeless
eyes.HALLENBECKWhere was Darian?SARAHShe stayed at Cindy's last night.
He nods.   Turns and waves the gun at Miller.HALLENBECKLet's take a walk, Buddy.EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAYThe two men come out the back door and cut through the
hedge.(CONTINUED)23.CONTINUED:Miller's car, a Pontiac Sunbird, is parked at the curb.
Hallenbeck stops in the middle of someone's yard.
Holsters his gun.
A neighbor's dog approaches, happily wagging its tail.
Hallenbeck bends and ruffles its fur.HALLENBECKWhere you want it, Mike?     Head
         or gut?MILLERListen, Joe, I --
                (stops, sighs)
         Gut.
Hallenbeck pats the dog. Straightens. Plants his back
foot and spins. Punches like a sledgehammer, into Miller's
gut.
Miller drops to his knees. Begins to retch.
Hallenbeck takes out a cigarette. Lights it.HALLENBECKIf I see you again, I'll kill
         you.
Miller nods weakly.    Gasping for breath.HALLENBECKSo.   West Hollywood at seven, right?MILLERHuh...?HALLENBECKThe job.     Seven o'clock, right?MILLERYou still... want the job...?HALLENBECKIt's two hundred bucks.MILLERYeah.   I guess it is.
He climbs to his feet, still doubled over.MILLERI'm sorry, Joe.(CONTINUED)24.CONTINUED:Hallenbeck says nothing. Miller turns and stumbles to
his car. Hallenbeck's face betrays nothing. A dead mask.
He walks back toward the hedge.
The neighbor's dog runs up, a tennis ball in its mouth.
Behind him, Mike Miller gets into the Sunbird.
Hallenbeck takes the tennis ball. Throws it.
The DOG BARKS and bounds after it.
Mike Miller turns the key in the ignition.
The CAR BLOWS to pieces.
An ERUPTION OF FLAME.
Flying glass and metal. The car becomes airborne.
Engulfed in fire. Does a lazy spin. Comes down.
The shockwave catches Hallenbeck.   Slams him ass over
teacups.
Windows blow in up and down the street.
Smoke and fire roll to the sky.
The DOG cowers, HOWLING in fear.
Beside it on the grass, the tennis ball is on fire.
Hallenbeck rolls to his feet. Covered with twigs and
leaves. Clothing scorched. Stares. Eyes glazed.CUT TO:EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - AN HOUR LATERA mobile crane hoists what's left of Mike Miller and his

three drinks, every   girl on stage looks like your     high
school sweetheart.    Was your sweetheart fat? Did      she
have excessive body   hair?
FUNK MUSIC, played LOUD. The Monday crowd stomps and
claps. Onstage a stripper grinds away with an enthusiasm
usually reserved for standing in line at the DMV.
Jimmy Dix sits at the bar, hooting and whistling. Behind
the bar, a black man in a wheelchair serves drinks. His
name is HARP.
Off to one side, a twenty-five-year-old BEANPOLE speaks
into a microphone:EMCEE (BEANPOLE)Flash of green buys a flash of
         pink, gentlemen. So reach into
         your pockets if you aren't there

The black man shakes his head.(CONTINUED)26.CONTINUED:HARPMy son. He writes his own

         leukemia. Old guy stops beating
         off long enough to laugh, my son
         thinks he's Eddie Murphy.
Jimmy uncaps a beer and raises it in a toast.JIMMYAlex the astronaut.
Harp raises his own glass.HARPAlex the astronaut.
It seems to be a common ritual between them. Jimmy
drinks, thumps the bottle down. Says, resolutely:JIMMYI've had it, Harp.HARPHad what?JIMMYIt, man. I've had it.
                (takes a swig)
         I don't remember what I did  last
         night. I'm an idiot, Harp,   I act
         like a complete dickhead.   I don't

His gaze wanders across the crowded room, fixating on --27.SCANTILY-CLAD WAITRESSWho makes her way between the tables. She is beautiful.
Stands out like a teamster at a gay rights rally. Supple
body. Deep green eyes. Flaxen hair. Her name is CORY.
She stops at a table against the wall. Puts down a
Seagrams V.O. in a rocks glass.
Seated at the table is a broad-shouldered man in a bad
suit. The essence of boredom. Looks like he's been
there three days. A cloud of smoke hangs around his
head. Mr. Joe Hallenbeck, no less.HALLENBECKThe police won't help you, huh?CORYSure. After I'm dead they'll

frowns.ANOTHER ANGLENear the stage, the would-be Eddie Murphy steps up to

            you were nobody.
Only Hallenbeck's eyes move. He looks up, regards Jimmy
coolly. They size each other up. Hallenbeck sighs.HALLENBECKEasy, Junior,   I'm not raining on

Shakes his head again. Walks to the end of the corridor.
Goes through the fire door. Out into:EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS ACTIONStarry, moonlit night.   A chill breeze.   Joe draws a
breath.
In front of him, on the wall of the club, is a poster:
BAYNARD FOR SENATE, it reads. Above the logo, a picture
of a benevolent-looking gray-haired man.
Hallenbeck regards it balefully.HALLENBECKI didn't vote for you, you bastard.
He looks away, and suddenly notices something on the
ground:
A half-smoked cigarette butt.
Just sitting there.
Joe stares at it. Thinks it over.
Starts to walk away. Stops.HALLENBECKYou're a fuckin' lowlife, Joe.(CONTINUED)36.CONTINUED:He bends to pick up the butt.
A steel sap whistles over his head, missing by inches.
Hallenbeck spins, startled. Reflexively lashes out with
a flattened palm. Misses, chops the air.
Two more men, behind him. Nowhere to go.
A sap pops him behind the left ear. A sickening thud.
The world spins out of focus. He goes down.
Hits the pavement like a ton of bricks.
Rolls over, staring up.
Vision muddy, indistinct.HALLENBECK'S POVThree silhouettes hover over him, backlit by streetlamps.

From a kneeling position, Hallenbeck flings a handful of
gravel at the man's eyes.

cuts the guy's throat like a knife through butter.

Bullets go through him. SHATTER the sedan's WINDSHIELD.

Too late. Joe rolls behind a mailbox.
BULLETS chase him, blowing apart the metal box.

He knows when a getaway is in order.
Just one problem.     He forgot about Jimmy Dix.
A SCREECH of TIRES.

Hitman. Kneels  down, fishes through the guy's coat
pockets. Comes  up with a bloody pack of cigarettes.
Extracts one.  Lights it.

stout. They both have the seasoned look of professional
mob hitters.

Hallenbeck is standing there with a handful of fresh
towels. He stops. Staring at Jimmy. They freeze in

Then Hallenbeck crosses the floor with two quick strides
and slugs Jimmy with all his might. Decks him.

that matter... and then it hits us: Joe is doing ven-
triloquism.

And the funny thing is, he's really good.
Pablo overcomes his shock.PABLOShit, is he doing that?
Hallenbeck's face remains cold.    Expressionless.HALLENBECKFurry Tom, tell Pablo what I'm

By now, all three hoods are in hysterics.HALLENBECKAre you mad, Furry Tom?HALLENBECK(as Furry Tom)
         I don't get mad. I get even.
And, with that, Furry Tom's mouth opens --
And EXPLODES, showering stuffing.
One of the goons is still laughing when he realizes half
his throat is gone...
And Furry Thomas BELCHES FIRE again, and the second goon
goes down in a spray of blood, and if you haven't guessed
already --
Joe has a gun hidden inside Furry Thomas.
Pablo is a little sharper. A little quicker.
He dives forward, knocks the puppet from Joe's hand.
Joe drives upward, into Pablo's gut.
They reel across the room. Locked in combat.
Lamps topple. GLASS BREAKS.
Pablo slams Joe's head into the wall.   Leaves a dent.
Does it again, a sickening impact...
Starts to strangle Joe --
And the truth is, Joe's not thirty anymore.
He's not going to make it. The world swims away.
Then, as if through a tunnel, Joe notices something
beside him... something hanging on the wall.
Fights to focus. Breath gone.    Strength gone.
Identifies the object:(CONTINUED)141.CONTINUED:His Presidential Medal of Valor.
Shiny medal. Shiny ribbon. His name...
It hits him quite suddenly:
The medal has sharp edges.
With the last of his strength, he plucks it from the
wall. Drives it into Pablo's throat.
The big man stumbles backward. Eyes wide. Gurgling.
He thrashes, the red-white-blue ribbon flapping obscenely
from his gushing neck.
Drops to the dusty carpet.    Dies.

Hallenbeck takes a deep breath. Eyes wide. Insane.
He is surrounded by corpses. He takes another deep
breath.
Picks up the sniper rifle.
Slings it over his shoulder.

Milo pitches forward.     Falls to his death.160.HALLENBECKstares, dumbfounded at Sarah.   She look up at him.
A moment passes between them.
Around Hallenbeck, a sea of crumpled cars. HORNS
BLARING. Amidst it all, he stands. Beaten. Bloody.
Bullet-scarred.
Jimmy winds his way through the cars. Walks up to Joe.
They stand in silence for a moment, then Jimmy says:JIMMYThe car's over on the other side.

         something.EXT. 405 FREEWAY - SOUTHBOUND LANE - NIGHTJimmy and Joe stand in the breakdown lane next to the
rented Subaru. Jimmy points to the shattered window.JIMMYSomebody broke in and swiped the
         suitcase from the back seat. Had
         to be Marcon, right?
There is a pause. They both stare at the car.
Two million. Down the drain.
Except, after a beat... they begin to laugh.
First chuckling, then chortling..
Now it's go-for-broke. Jimmy hoots. Joe howls.

Opens it.

meteor.CUT TO:EAST L.A. SIDESTREET - NIGHTTwo ten-year-old black boys are walking down the street.
Out strolling in the poverty that exists in the shadow of
the skyscrapers.
Quite suddenly, without warning --
A football drops out of the sky.
Hits and bounces, very high --
Comes down. Settles. Rocks, back and forth.
The kids look up, puzzled.      Searching the sky.

The ball sits there.    Only slightly scorched.
Tentatively, almost like he's afraid of being caught,
one of the boys bends down... looks both ways...
Picks up the ball.    Smiles.
Then, as if by some unspoken agreement --
The other boy starts to run.
Slowly at first, then faster... faster still...
A slant pattern, heading for the mailbox...
And at 12 midnight on December 22nd, the San Pedro Street
quarterback throws an absolutely perfect pass.

He shuts the case.    Shoves it toward Jimmy.
