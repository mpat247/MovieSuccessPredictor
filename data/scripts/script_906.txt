          This is a line of hard men branded by prison: shorn hair,
          broken nose, eyes with a cold ferocity. And their aggression
          has a nihilistic edge; their spirits never surrender. There's
          nothing beaten down about these men. Like Alcatraz,
          Leavenworth, and Sing Sing, this is the end of the line.PRISON GUARDSin visored black caps, black shirts, black patent leather Sam

          Hamilton flashes the badge. He shoves Dillinger inside. In an
          adjacent room FIVE GUARDS play poker. Next to them is a
          barred entrance to the prison yard. As the cage door locks
          behind him, this is the last place Dillinger wants to have
