                                        Bob IsraelSHOOTING DRAFT (1984)FADE IN:EXT. ST. ANN'S SCHOOL - DAYCAMERA PANS a group of freshly-scrubbed, innocent children, 
               obediently standing in line, like recruits for the Holy 
               Crusade. PULL BACK to REVEAL they are wearing the gray 
               blazers, striped ties and navy slacks of St. Luke's School. 
               They are waiting patiently at the curbside in front of the 
               statue of the school's sainted namesake. One of the fifth 
               grade BOYS pokes the KID next to him with his elbow. The 
               other Kid is about to retaliate when SISTER MARY FRANCIS, a 
               stern-faced nun, appears behind them, grabbing them both 
               firmly by the shoulders.SISTER MARY FRANCISMake one more move and you'll both 
                         be staying late for the rest of the 
                         week.THE BOYS(softly; in unison)
                         Sorry, Sister Mary Francis.SISTER MARY FRANCISI didn't hear you.THE BOYS(louder)
                         Sorry, Sister Mary Francis.

               Sister Mary Francis checks her watch. She scowls and looks 
               out past the parking lot gate.

               Suddenly we HEAR the SOUND of an ENGINE roaring at full 
               throttle. There is a SCREECHING of BRAKES, followed by the 
               loud GRINDING of GEARS. It sounds like the Indy 500 is taking 
               place around the corner.SISTER MARY FRANCIS(used to this)
                         Step away from the curb, children.ANOTHER ANGLEZooming through the parking lot gates is a large yellow school 
               bus. It practically takes the last turn on just two wheels. 
               The bus driver quickly slams on the brakes, leaving ten feet 
               of rubber behind him as the bus comes to an ear-splitting 
               halt right in front of them. The front door immediately swings 
               open and RICK STAHL, the driver, hops out. Rick is the life 
               of the party, even when there isn't any party going on.

               While chronologically older than the St. Luke students, the 
               only thing that sets him apart from them is that he has a 
               driver's license. Rick figures he'll live up to his 
               capabilities and get serious in his next life... This 
               incarnation's strictly for laughs. Sister Mary Francis steps 
               up to him.SISTER MARY FRANCISYou're late again, Rick.RICKI know, Sister, but I have a very 
                         good excuse.SISTER MARY FRANCISThere can be no excuse for tardiness.RICKYou're absolutely right. I should 
                         never have stopped to save that 
                         drowning infant. I'm just weak, 
                         Sister; I'm so weak.

               He starts sobbing softly into his hands.SISTER MARY FRANCISAll right, stop that... Children, on 
                         the bus.

               The kids obediently file past Rick, who makes like he is 
               drying his tears with his handkerchief.RICKSister, do you ever get lonely after 
                         vespers? If you do, why don't you 
                         give me a call. I'm in the book.SISTER MARY FRANCIS(smiling despite 
                              herself)
                         Get going, Rick... you're late enough 
                         as it is.RICKRight... Think it over.

               He hops on the bus, closes the door and gently backs the bus 
               out of the parking lot.INT. BUS - DAYAs soon as the bus is out of sight of the school, all hell 
               breaks loose. The formally well-mannered children are acting 
               like normal kids... hitting each other over the heads with 
               books, running up and down the aisles, screaming at the top 
               of their lungs.ANGLE - RICKHe removes the St. Christopher statue from the dashboard, 
               revealing a hulaing Hawaiian girl in a grass skirt. He watches 
               the madness behind him in his rearview mirror, picks up the 
               P.A. microphone and rationally attempts to restore order.RICK(over mike)
                         If you don't all calm down I'm gonna 
                         drive this thing over a cliff.

               The kids pay no attention to him.RICK(continuing; 
                              philosophically)
                         Ah... youth.EXT. THE BUSRick's bus pulls up to a light and another school bus filled 
               with kids (from a public school) pulls up alongside of it. 
               The other DRIVER gives Rick a competitive smirk and guns his 
               engine. Rick counters by gunning his.INT. THE BUSAll the kids start screaming "Race... race." "Wipe 'em out." 
               "Go for it." Etc. Some of the kids even start taking out 
               money and start betting one another on the race's outcome.ANGLE - RICKas he readies for action.EXT. THE BUSESThe light turns green and they're off. Or as off as two lunky 
               school buses filled with kids can be.WIDE SHOT - ANOTHER STREETThe two buses come zooming down the street.INT. RICK'S BUSThe kids are screaming at Rick to go faster. One of the little 
               boys looks nauseous as he clutches the seat in front of him.EXT. THE STREET - LOW ANGLEThe buses squeeze down a narrow street, neck and neck with 
               one another.INT. THE BUSThe kids are all yelling words of encouragement to Rick, who 
               is hunched over in his seat, driving with the determination 
               of Andy Granitelli. The nauseous kid is now turning a pale 
               shade of green. He moves to an open window, straining to 
               control the inevitable.EXT. THE BUSESThey race down a steep hill.INT. THE BUSThe nauseous kid can't hold it any longer.EXT. THE OTHER BUSSomething hits with a splat against the windshield that 
               resembles Campbell's Chunky Vegetable Soup.INT. THE OTHER BUSThe other Driver turns on the windshield. It only makes it 
               worse.EXT. THE STREETRick's bus pulls out in front, accompanied by the cheering 
               of his passengers. Suddenly a stop light looms ahead. Rick 
               puts on his brakes. Both buses stop just in time.INT. RICK'S BUSRick's kids are all piled in a clump right behind him in the 
               front of the bus. Although disheveled, the kids still manage 
               a victorious cheer.PHOTOGRAPHER'S POVWe're LOOKING THROUGH the camera lens. We SEE a cute one-
               year-old baby boy. He's sitting on a cuddly blanket. We HEAR 
               the VOICE of Jay O'Neill. He is a baby photographer at Sears.O'NEILL (O.S.)Okay, Timmy... hold that smile... 
                         and watch the birdie.

               He takes the picture and we SEE the camera flash.O'NEILL (O.S.)There.O'NEILLWe see he has his camera and backdrop set up in the camera 
               department behind a velour curtain which blacks out the rest 
               of the store. He's conservatively dressed in a suit, vest 
               and tie. He looks like he could be a Young Republican. But 
               under those Sears clothes is a man a little off center. Rick's 
               best friend. Need we say more? He takes the film out of the 
               camera. The matronly mother is in the process of gathering 
               up her baby.O'NEILLThese should be in the mail to you 
                         by next Friday.

               She smiles and exits.O'NEILL(continuing)
                         Next.

               A beautiful -- and we're talking gorgeous -- WOMAN enters. 
               Her clothes hug every curve of her body. She has her baby in 
               her arms. O'Neill immediately wants her, and now. His eyes 
               settle onto her full breasts. These he likes.O'NEILL(continuing)
                         Whoa. Look at those babies.

               She gets this innuendo and loves it.O'NEILL(continuing)
                         How are we doing? My name is O'Neill.

                         take that baby picture.

               He takes the baby. He has a hard time taking his eyes off 
               her breasts. He places the baby on the blanket.O'NEILL(continuing)
                         If I were you, I'd breast feed until 
                         I was 17 or 18.

                         with your child?

               She coyly leans INTO FRAME.O'NEILL (O.S.)(continuing)
                         A-huh. A little more... good!

               She is totally blocking her baby out of the picture.O'NEILLHe gets out from behind the camera.O'NEILLI'm getting one heck of a glare off 
                         your dress there. Could you undo a 
                         few buttons?WOMAN(seductively)
                         Of course.

               She starts to unbutton her blouse. O'Neill looks into his 
               camera.O'NEILL'S POV THROUGH LENSWe SEE the Woman finish her last button.O'NEILL (O.S.)Now lean in a little more... more...

               near her breasts. He has them on his head. He's cheek to 
               breast. Etc.RICKenters and witnesses the photo session. He immediately jumps 
               into the shots.THROUGH CAMERA LENSRick joins the craziness. After several beats, the Woman 
               gets bored and EXITS the FRAME.THE WOMANAs Rick and O'Neill continue mugging like two 12-year-olds 
               in a photo booth, the Woman takes her child and exits. A few 
               beats pass and the guys notice they're alone.O'NEILLWhere'd she go?RICKShe probably had sex scheduled for 
                         12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the 
                         guys for a drink... I have major 
                         news to announce.

               O'Neill crosses to his camera and takes out the film.O'NEILLOkay... be right with ya.RICKHe picks up some photographs of today's work.INSERT - PHOTOSEach one has a different mother in several seductive poses.

               Several Chicanos are working on various cars. Rick and O'Neill 
               hop out.RICKHey, Chulo, where are you, man?ANGLE - LATE-MODEL CARWe SEE a very large pair of shoes sticking out from under 
               the chassis. Slowly, a large, bear-like body rolls out and 
               we catch our first glimpse of CHULO. A happy-go-lucky mechanic 
               of Mexican ancestry.CHULOHey, you guys, what's going on?RICKWe're going for a little liquid 
                         refreshment.CHULOGreat. I'll go with you. Wait a 
                         second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, 
                         will you?

               A SMALL MECHANIC with an eye patch gets into a car behind 
               them as we DOLLY WITH the guys THROUGH the lot.CHULO(continuing)
                         Roberto, you finished fixing that 
                         lighter yet?

               Another MECHANIC sticks his face out of another car and shakes 
               his head. Just then Raul, the eye-patched worker, whizzes by 
               behind the guys, driving the car in a zig-zag pattern right 
               into traffic.CHULO(continuing; to Rick)
                         I'm glad you guys came by... What's 
                         the occasion?O'NEILLRick's got an important announcement 
                         to make.CHULOYeah. What is it?RICKI've decided not to run for President.CHULOToo bad, man, that blows my chance 
                         to be Ambassador to France.

               Behind them we can SEE Roberto fiddling with the lighter. 
               Suddenly flames leap out of the car, blowing Roberto ten 
               feet into the air.ANGLEThe guys all start to pile into the bus. Nearby another 
               employee is washing down the garage with a hose.

               Chulo turns to another mechanic, who has his head under the 
               hood of a car.CHULOManuel, be sure and finish up the 
                         electrical system on that Chevy.

               Manuel waves at Chulo, who turns, hops on the bus. Rick starts 
               it up and starts to drive away. Just as the bus CLEARS FRAME, 
               we SEE Manuel connect two wires together at the same moment 
               the guy with the hose washes down the area around his feet. 
               Manuel lights up like a Christmas tree, screaming in pain. 
               There is a beat, and then Robert falls INTO FRAME, still 
               holding the cigarette lighter, and the car Raul is driving 
               enters the lot and smashes into the side of the garage.INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAYA sign on an office door says "CONCERT TICKET AGENCY." From 
               inside we HEAR someone TALKING loudly on the phone. Chulo, 
               Rick and O'Neill open the door and go inside. On the walls 
               in the cramped office there are rock 'n' roll concert posters 
               advertising rock bands like Men At Work, The Clash and Barry 
               Manilow. Behind a cluttered desk we FIND a little man with a 
               thin mustache and horn-rimmed glasses. This is GARY MELNITZ, 
               wheeler-dealer, entrepreneur and coward. Gary yells a lot, 
               which is a definite overcompensation for his size and 
               inability to deal with the opposite sex.GARY(yelling; into phone)

               cashier, PHOEBE, has devoted her life to following the current

               One of the young MALE CUSTOMERS approaches an attractive 
               salesgirl. This is DEBBIE THOMERSON, Rick's intended. She 
               seems to be the only sane employee in the place because she's 
               actually working, putting clothes on the racks. This 
               impression of sanity fits her, as she is level-headed, and 
               has a clear sense of herself. She can also take a joke, thus

               enters one. We SEE that the saloon-style doors of the booths 
               have been hung too high, so as he takes off his pants, his 
               underwear is exposed to the world. We PULL BACK, REVEALING 
               other people in other booths, their bare asses clearly in 
               sight. No one in the store seems to care, however, as they 
               are much too busy dancing.

               The front door opens and BOBBIE, a very sultry and earthy-
               looking girl with long, dark hair, pushes inside. She is

               The girls screech and jump around, hugging each other in 
               sheer joy. A MALE CUSTOMER, moved by this outpouring of 
               affection, moves over and gets in the middle of the girls, 
               enjoying every moment of being hugged by three women at once.DEBBIE(to Customer; realizing)

               O'Neill unscrews the mouthpiece off the phone. He pours the

               Mr. Thomerson, in the bedroom, picks up the receiver. As he 
               does so, a cloud of cocaine falls out of the mouthpiece. He 
               screams at Rick, gesturing with the phone in his hand as he 
               dials. Each move produces a large cloud of powder, which 
               causes him to sniffle slightly.MR. THOMERSONI never liked you. I've never liked

               He starts to react from inhaling the powder. He puts the 
               receiver to his ear. He takes a deep breath and tries to 
               dial another number. A large cloud of coke flies up his nose. 
               He's stunned. He takes another deep drag. He's hooked. He 
               forgets all about dialing. He jams the receiver against his 
               nose and takes deep drag after deep drag.

               on the screen a man has come to the rescue of the woman.

               A fight starts in the movie, also. The patrons sit calmly 
               watching the action. Miraculously, Rick's fight with Cole is 
               in perfect sync with the actors in the movie. Rick hits Cole 
               with a punch that sends him backwards into several movie 
               patrons. The patrons are impressed by the realism of the 
               film's special effects. Cole throws a punch. Rick ducks. The 
               punch hits a MAN in the front row in the mouth.MAN(to LADY next to him)
                         Gee, what a realistic effect.WOMANYeah, like you're in the movie with 
                         them.

               Rick climbs over several rows and continues to pummel Cole. 
               Cole grabs a woman's purse and begins to hit Rick with it. 
               Cole runs out of the aisle as Rick climbs over people and 
               dives onto Cole, knocking him to the aisle.PATRON(to his date)
                         Best 3D I've ever seen.

               As the movie ends, Rick has Cole by the collar and is dragging 
               him out of the theater.INT. MALL OUTSIDE THEATERRick exits the theater with Cole. He tosses Cole to Chulo. 
               Debbie comes running behind Rick.RICK(to Debbie)

                         a thought. Why don't we go home and

               The Patrons are exiting. All of them are very up and excited 
               by their 3D experience.WOMANAbsolutely amazing.

               shreds doesn't seem pleased.MANI've seen better.EXT. BLUFF - DAYIt's another gorgeous day on the bluff overlooking the ocean. 
               Just right for Rick and Debbie's wedding. We SEE the wedding 
               in progress. The area is adorned with flowers.

               The many guests are seated and taken in the moment. Among 
               these are Tracey, Desiree and Gary's she-man, who waves to 
               Gary as he stands with the other ushers, Chulo, Ryko and 
               Larry. Chulo is choked up and trying to hide his tears. He 
               looks over at Laverne, who smiles to him.CHULO(to Ryko)
                         Hey, man, don't forget my bachelor 
                         party's next Friday night.GARYI'll get the hookers.RYKONo way.

               Nearby stand the maids of honor, Bobbie, Phoebie and Ilene, 
               who blows a kiss to her date, Ray (one of the Japanese 
               businessmen).

               The Thomersons sit in the front row. Neither of them is 
               cherishing this moment.MR. THOMERSON(sotto; to Mrs.

                         But... at least we'll have grandkids.

               They sort of smile at each other at the thought.

               Father Falwell is almost through with the ceremony. A car 
               pulls up in the b.g. Exiting the car is Stan and a WOMAN. 
               O'Neill, the best man, sees the car. He pokes Rick. He 
               indicates to Rick someone has arrived.STANWe SEE the man in the car is Stan. He ushers the lady in the 
               car to Larry. He's surprised at who she is: his wife.LARRYSue!SUEHi, honey.LARRYHow'd you get here?SUERick called me.

               Larry looks to Rick and gives him a warm smile and a wave. 
               Rick acknowledges Larry.LARRYWhy don't we go someplace and talk.

                         Off in the distance a storm is coming 
                         in fast over the ocean. The wind 
                         begins to pick up. Undaunted, Rick 
                         continues his soliloquy.RICKIn fact, more than dairy products in 
                         general. I love dairy. My love is

               his attention.FATHER FALWELLRick. Rick. Hey...

               People begin to scurry for cover. In the b.g., under a tree, 
               we SEE Larry and his wife huddled in each other's arms. From 
               the way they look, they have worked things out.RICKRICKI think this song pretty much sums 
                         up the way I feel at this moment.

               He begins to sing the theme from "The Flintstones" with all 
               the gusto of Jack Jones.
