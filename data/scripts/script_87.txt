deserted bar, talking quietly, oblivious to  the   exotic dancer
grinding her pelvis on a pole in the middle  of   the small
stage. Body language and charisma tell us   that   Caesar is the
boss, "Ducks" his lieutenant.DUCKSIt's Peezee. Gotta be.    He hates your
           fuckin' guts.CAESAR(brooding)
           I don't know.DUCKSWho else knew about the money? And
           how did Peezee know they popped Tony

           I don't know.DUCKS(pressing)
           What is so hard to understand here?
           You said yourself Peezee was a
           mamaluke and you couldn't trust him.
           Now suddenly you're soft on the guy?CAESARI just don't think it was him.DUCKSOkay, I'll bite. If not Peezee, then
           who?CAESAR(slowly rising to
                    his full height)
           I think it was you, Ducks.
Caesar starts to walk away as the bartender, now holding a
sawed-off shotgun, moves closer to Ducks. The exotic dancer
splits in a hurry through a curtain at the back of the stage.DUCKS(scared)
           You gotta be kiddin'!
Caesar stops at the door where two of his soldiers have2.appeared, holding AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.DUCKSCaesar, you know me! What kind of
            fuckin' idiot would I have to be to
            try that shit with you?CAESARA dead fuckin' idiot.
As he walks out the door, the soldiers OPEN FIRE on Marty

The WISEGUY gets up and starts switching channels on the TV.
A couple of CONVICTS in the back start to protest.CONVICTHey!   What're you doin', asshole!
Vitti turns and stares at them.      They fall silent
immediately.CONVICTSorry, Mr. Vitti. Didn't mean any
            disrespect.WISEGUYPunks.
Vitti turns the page and sees a huge headline in the Post:

Vitti stands up and heads back to his cell.CUT TO:INT. CELL BLOCK - MOMENTS LATERAs Vitti approaches his cell, he sees a prison guard standing
by. His cellmate, EARL, a giant of a man, comes out of their
cell carrying his bedroll and a box containing his other
meager possessions.VITTI(suspicious)
          What's goin' on, Earl?EARLThey're transferring me.VITTIWhy?EARL(shrugs)
          Don't know. Thanks for looking out
          for me, Mr. Vitti.VITTIYeah.     Take it easy.
He notices something in the box.VITTIHey, Earl.     Is that my after-shave?EARL(blanches)

          didn't know --VITTIThat's okay.     Keep it.   Go ahead.EARLThanks.     See you around.
Earl exits with the guard. Vitti hesitates a moment, then
warily steps into his cell.CUT TO:INT. VITTI'S CELL - MIDDLE OF NIGHTThe cellblock is quiet. A guard stops outside the darkened
cell, looks around to make sure no one is watching, then4.pulls out a GUN with a SILENCER, reaches through the bars and

Then he slips away as quietly as he appeared.

ON his exit we PAN DOWN TO Vitti, unhurt, curled up under his
bunk.CUT TO:INT. MEMORIAL CHAPEL - DAYA deluxe casket flanked by elaborate floral displays and an
easel displaying a portrait of the deceased, Dr. Isaac Sobel.
Mourners fill the pews, standees at the back, an overflow
crowd. BEN SOBEL sits in the front row, staring at the
casket with his wife, LAURA, his son, MICHAEL, now a
teenager, BEN'S MOTHER, and her friend, DR. JOYCE BROTHERS.
At the podium, the RABBI is speaking.RABBIAnd now I'd like to call on Isaac's
          son, Dr. Ben Sobel, who would like to
          say a few words.
Ben rises and crosses solemnly to the podium.BEN(addressing audience)
          It's very difficult for me to talk
          about my father, because in a sense
          I'm talking about two men.BEN (CONT'D)One, of    course, is the public Isaac
          Sobel,    the eminent psychotherapist and
          popular    author known to millions of
          readers    around the world.
Laura, Michael and Ben's Mother listen proudly to the eulogy.BENThe second Isaac Sobel is the private
          man -- my father -- Dad. And for
          those of you who knew him well and
          knew our family -- well, let's face it

          tapioca.

          You all right, Paul?
Vitti just stares, wild-eyed, actually drooling a little.WISEGUY #2Can I have your tapioca?

A guard, the one who tried to kill him, watches Vitti from
his post. Then he nods to someone across the room.
COYOTE, a heavily-muscled and tattooed gang member, nods in
response.
Vitti walks past the table where Coyote is sitting with other
tough Hispanic gang members.COYOTE(to Vitti)
          Hey, Fredo! Or is it Guido?
His friends laugh.
Vitti stops and stares dumbly at them.COYOTEJust keep walkin', Don Corleone.
There is a tense moment, then Vitti bursts out laughing.COYOTEShut up!
Vitti laughs harder, strangely manic.COYOTEI said, shut up, bitch!7.But Vitti can't stop. He drops his tray of slop, splattering
food on the men. Coyote leaps to his feet and pulls a shiv.COYOTEYou're a dead man, jefe!
Coyote lunges at Vitti with the knife, but Vitti suddenly
whirls around, bashes Coyote in the face with his food tray
and bursts into song.VITTI(singing, with
                   appropriate dance

Prisoners and guards stare at him like he's nuts.
Coyote stabs at him again, but Vitti dodges and smashes him
over the head with the tray.VITTI'When you're a Jet,
          If the shit hits the fan,

Coyote rushes him, but Vitti sidesteps and hits him in the
face.
Guards move in from all sides.   Vitti jumps up on the
tabletop to escape them.VITTI(kicking at them,

carry him out stiff as a board.VITTI'Tonight, tonight, won't be just

Ben opens the front door and they go in.CUT TO:INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS ACTIONThe family enters the foyer.BENOkay, I might have strayed from my
          notes a little. I'm dealing with a
          lot of stuff here. Grief is a
          process.
Laura notices FBI AGENTS CERRONE and MILLER waiting for them
in the living room. Cerrone is an attractive woman in her
late twenties, wearing a dangerously-short skirt. Miller is
a clean-cut man in his thirties.MILLERDr. Sobel, I'm Agent Miller, this is
          Special Agent Cerrone, Federal Bureau
          of Investigation. We'd just like to

Ben gestures for them to sit.

Laura and Michael both look at him doubtfully.BENI mean -- there were issues -- as, I

In certain people, continuous exposure
to an extremely stressful situation --
soldiers in combat, for instance,
disaster victims, a hostage situation,
or being locked up in a maximum
security prison with someone trying to
kill you -- it can produce a temporary
psychotic state.CHAPINHow temporary?BENA day, a week, up to a month -- if the
precipitating stressors are removed.CHAPIN(musing)
Which means he's not going to get any
better while he's still in the can.BENHe could get worse. He could
deteriorate to the point where he'd be
permanently schizophrenic.CHAPINThen I'd say he's got a real problem,
because he goes before the parole
board in four weeks.BENYou think they'll let him out?CHAPINOh, yeah, I'm sure they'll want to
release a major Mafia figure who's now
totally deranged on top of it.BEN(thinks)
Well, couldn't you release him to    a
halfway house or some place where    he
could get some decent treatment?
Based on my earlier work with him,    I
don't think he's dangerous, and I
think he was making a real effort    to
reform himself.18.CHAPINYou do, huh?
        (thinks for a
         long moment)
Okay. Then I'll tell you what. I'm
gonna release him into your custody.BENMine? Me? No, this is a bad time for
me. My father just died -- and I've
got this bulging disc in my neck --
and we're redecorating, which is a
total nightmare. I can't --CHAPINYou want to see him killed in prison?BENNo, of course not.CHAPINOr sent to a facility for the
criminally insane.BENNo --CHAPINThen he's all yours. I'm going to
talk to the Bureau of Prisons and get
you certified as a temporary federal
institution.BEN(stricken)
What?    I can't be an institution.CHAPIN(firm)
You've got thirty days to get him in
shape for his parole hearing. That
means sane, sober and gainfully
employed. But let me warn you,
Doctor. If he fucks up in any way --
if he flees, or if I find out that
this whole thing was just a setup so
he could get back on the street and
return to a life of crime -- I will
hold you totally responsible, and I'll
see that you are stripped of your
license and prosecuted to the full
extent of the law. Are we clear?BEN(gulp)

Ben nervously pops a pill and swallows it.VITTI(re:   pill)

          big compliment.BENI'm sure they'd be flattered.    So --VITTIThe feds are really putting the
          pressure on. The families are
          fighting each other again -- what's
          left of 'em. It's the fall of the
          fuckin' Roman Empire. It's
          World War Three out there.BENSo what does that have to do with you?VITTIThey knew I was gettin' out soon and
          the last thing anybody wants to see is
          me getting into it on either side.BENMaybe if you just explain to
          them -- that you're out of it now,
          that you're starting a new life --VITTIYeah,   they'll probably want to throw
          me a   party and give me a gold watch.

          you're    well enough, which is now. So
          are you    coming in with me or do I have

          absolutely no use to me. But back on
          the street, Vitti's still powerful
          enough to pose a threat to both
          families. It's like throwing gasoline
          on a fire.DAVISIf we can use Vitti to escalate this
          war, we might just end up putting them

          life.CHAPINIf? People like Paul Vitti     don't

          Being a criminal is all he    knows.
          Trust me.DAVISHe's gonna head straight for trouble.
          Then all we have to do is sit back and

that I can really listen and

Jelly tucks a few bills into her G-string.     She looks at Ben

          a couple of bucks.
Ben reluctantly digs in his pocket and holds out a bill to
the stripper.BENCan you break a twenty?
The stripper sensuously fingers the top of her G-string, and
Ben gingerly sticks the twenty in it.BENDo I just make my own change?
He tentatively reaches for some smaller bills in her G-string
but she dances away.BEN(calls to her)

Suddenly he is grabbed from behind and slammed up against the
door by Enormous Bobby. Bobby slams him against the door a

door is opened by someone inside and Enormous Bobby shoves
Ben into the room.CUT TO:INT. BASEMENT ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTIONBen hits the floor to a chorus of surprised reactions from

conduit backs across the street and stops, blocking the path
of the convoy.
The lead SUV HONKS. The truck doesn't move. The CAPTAIN of
the marshals gets out and walks up to the truck. The driver
has slipped out the other side and disappeared.
Suddenly, a huge steel claw drops down from above and closes
around the top of the armored truck, its sharp points
crunching into the metal sides. Then the truck starts rising
off the pavement. A couple of determined marshals jump out
of their vehicles, race over and grab onto the bumpers as the
armored truck is lifted off the ground.CUT TO:EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - CONTINUOUS ACTIONA hundred-foot tower crane lifts the truck straight up. The
marshals hang on as long as they can, then prudently let go
and drop heavily to the street. Two marshals are still
clinging to the truck as it rises to a height of thirty feet,
then swings silently over the perimeter fencing.108.INT. CONSTRUCTION SITEA bank of arc lights is switched on illuminating the site as
the truck is lowered to the ground. Heavily-armed gangsters
in ski masks surround the truck and herd the driver, the
shotgun guard and the frightened marshals

attack the back doors.
Vitti pulls down his ski mask and taps Ben.BENPaul, it's not too late.   Don't do
