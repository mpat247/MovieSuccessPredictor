Forty Acres and a Mule Filmworks, Inc.YA-DIG SHO-NUFFBY ANY MEANS NECESSARYWGA #45816"The greatest miracle Christianity has achieved in America
is that the black man in white Christian hands has not grown
violent.  It is a miracle that 22 million black people have
not risen up against their oppressors--in which they would
have been justified by all moral criteria, and even by the
democratic tradition!  It is a miracle that a nation of
black people has so fervently continued to believe in a
turn-the-other-cheek and heaven-for-you-after-you-die
philosophy!  It is a miracle that the American Black people
have remained a peaceful people, while catching all the
centuries of hell that they have caught, here in white man's
heaven!  The miracle is that the white man's puppet Negro
'leaders,' his preachers and the educated Negroes laden with
degrees, and others who have been allowed to wax fat off
their black poor brothers, have been able to hold the black
masses quiet until now."--THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MALCOLM XTITLES--WHITE ON BLACKPLACEBrooklyn, New YorkCUT TO:TIMEPresentCUT TO:WEATHERHot as shit!CUT TO:INT: WE LOVE RADIO STATION STOREFRONT--DAYEXTREME CLOSE UPWE SEE only big white teeth and very Negroidal (big) lips.MISTER SE�OR LOVE DADDYWaaaake up!

pizzeria--Sal's Famous Pizzeria.

From out of the car comes the owner, SAL, a slightly
overweight man in his early fifties, and his two sons, PINO,
22, and VITO, 20.  It's time for them to go to work at Sal's
Famous Pizzeria in the heart of Black Brooklyn.  Sal's sits
on the corner of The Block.  The Block being where this film
on the hottest day of the summer takes place.

day long.EXT: MOTHER SISTER'S STOOP--DAYMookie stops to say hello to MOTHER SISTER.  She leans out
her window on the parlor floor.  In the summertime, the only
time when she's not perched in her window is when she's
asleep.MOTHER SISTERGood morning, Mookie.MOOKIEGood morning to you.MOTHER SISTERNow, Mookie, don't work too hard

Pino looks at his father.  He wants to be backed up on this;
all he gets is an amused look, and a smirk from Vito.PINOWho's working for who?

There's a knock on the door and Da Mayor enters.SALCome on in, Mayor.DA MAYORGood morning, gentlemens.  It's
		  gonna be a scorcher today, that's
		  for sure.  Need any work done
		  around here?

Sal looks at Pino, who reluctantly gives Da Mayor the broom.DA MAYORIt will be the cleanest sidewalk in
		  Brooklyn.  Clean as the Board of
		  Health.

Da Mayor almost runs out of the pizzeria in his hurry; soon
as he finishes he'll be able to get a bottle.PINOPop, I don't believe this shit.  We
		  runnin' welfare or somethin'?
		  Every day you give dat bum--MOOKIEDa Mayor ain't no bum.PINOGive dat bum a dollar for sweeping

are CEE, PUNCHY, and the lone female, ELLA.ELLAWhat's keeping him?PUNCHYYou call him, then.

She looks up into his window, then sits down.ELLAPunchy, if ya want to do some more

appears.AHMADWho's yelling my name?ELLAPunchy told me to.AHMADDon't listen to him, it will get ya
		  in trouble.ELLAHeard that, Punchy.

Ahmad sits down with them.AHMADElla, you have a brain, use it.

In the BG, we hear the dum-dum-dum of a giant box.  The
sound gets louder as the box gets closer.  The youths look
down the block and see a tall young man coming towards them.
He has a very distinct walk, it's more like a bop.  This is
RADIO RAHEEM.  The size of his box is tremendous and one has
to think, how does he carry something that big around with
him?  It must weigh a ton, and it seems like the sidewalk
shakes as the rap music blares out.  The song we hear is the
only one Radio Raheem plays.MEDIUM SHOT--RADIO RAHEEMRadio Raheem stops in front of the group, looks at them, and
turns down the volume.  It's quiet again.RADIO RAHEEMPeace, y'all.ELLAPeace, Radio Raheem.CEEPeace.10.PUNCHYYou the man, Radio Raheem.AHMADIt's your world.CEEIn a big way.

paper bag is twisted into a knot at the bottom.  He stops
and takes a long swig.MOTHER SISTERYou ole drunk.  What did I tell ya
		  about drinking in front of my stoop?
		  Move on, you're blocking my view.

Da Mayor lowers the can from his mouth and looks up at his
heckler.  It's obvious from the look on his face he's heard
this before.  Da Mayor contorts his face and stares at her.MOTHER SISTERYou ugly enough.  Don't stare at me.

Da Mayor changes his face into a more grotesque look.MOTHER SISTERThe evil eye doesn't work on me.DA MAYORMother Sister, you've been talkin'

final swig of beer just for her.INT: TINA'S APARTMENT--DAYAn elderly Puerto Rican woman, CARMEN, is telling off her
daughter TINA in Spanish.  Tina, having heard enough, closes
the door on her mother's ranting and raving.ANGLE--TINATina bends down and scoops her baby son HECTOR up from the
bed and holds him for dear life to her breasts.  She talks
to her son while walking around the room.TINAHector, I shouldn't be telling you
		  this but you would find out sooner
		  or later.  Ya father ain't no real

		  mistake, but you are not.

Tina kisses her son.  Tina is seventeen years old, another
teenage parent.EXT: STREET CORNER--DAYEvery day on this corner, summer or winter, spring or fall,
a small group of men meet.  They have no steady employment,
nothing they can speak of; they do, however, have the gift
of gab.  These man can talk, talk, and mo' talk, and when a
bottle is going round and they're feeling "nice," they get
philosophical.  These men become the great thinkers of the
world, with solutions to all its ills; like drugs, the
homeless, and AIDS.  They're called the Corner Men: SWEET

Sal grabs his Mickey Mantle bat from underneath the counter
and brings it down on Radio Raheem's box, again and again
and again.  The music stops.CLOSE--RADIO RAHEEM'S BOXRadio Raheem's pride and joy is smashed to smithereens.
It's going to the junkyard quick.ANGLE--PIZZERIAThere is an eerie quiet as everyone is frozen, surprised by
the suddenness of Sal's action, the swings of his Mickey
Mantle bat.  All look at Radio Raheem and realize what is
about to happen.ANGLE--RADIO RAHEEMRadio Raheem screams, he goes crazy.RADIO RAHEEMMy music!

Radio Raheem picks Sal up from behind the counter and starts
to choke his ass.  Radio Raheem's prized possession--his
box, the only thing he owned of value--his box, the one
thing that gave him any sense of worth--has been smashed to
bits. (Radio Raheem, like many Black youth, is the victim of
materialism and a misplaced sense of values.) Now he doesn't
give a fuck anymore.  He's gonna make Sal pay with his life.

Vito and Pino jump on Radio Raheem, who only tightens his
grip around Sal's neck.  Buggin' Out tries to help his
friend.  Mookie just stands and watches as Ahmad, Cee,
Punchy, and Ella cheerlead.79.EXT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--NIGHTThe tangled mass of choking, biting, kicking, screaming

The fight continues.  Da Mayor is smart enough not to get in
the middle of this war.  We hear sirens, somebody has calledDA COPS.ANGLE--STREET80.The cop cars come right through the crowd, almost running
over some people.  The cops get out with nightsticks and
guns drawn.  WE RECOGNIZE two of the faces, Officers Long
and Ponte.  Any time there is a skirmish between a Black man
and a white man, you can bet the house on who the copes are
gonna go for.  You know the deal!  Buggin' Out is pulled off
first, then Vito and Pino, but Radio Raheem is a crazed man.
It takes all six cops to pull him off Sal, who is red as a
beet from being choked.ANGLE--COPSHandcuffs are put on Buggin' Out as he watches the other
cops put a choke hold on Radio Raheem to restrain him.ANGLE--RADIO RAHEEMRadio Raheem is still struggling, then he just stops, his

into the back seat.  Buggin' Out is pushed into another car.
The cop cars speed off; in their haste to beat it, they have
left the crowd.  It's at this point the crowd becomes an
angry mob.81.ANGLE--MOBThe mob looks at...ANGLE--MOB POVSal still on the sidewalk, being helped to his feet by Vito
