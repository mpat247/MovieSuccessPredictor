                 kid on the team. The doctor said he could
                 be six-four. I can't wait for you to see
                 him play. Maybe you could even coach?

       Chris looks past his kids, looking a thousand yards out.TAYAMcKenna's about to lose that tooth and
                 I'm worried she's going to swallow it.
                 She said she'd let you pull it. But only
                 you.

      THE SHEEPDOG jumps on the back of COLTON'S FRIEND. The
      boy goes down hard, gets up crying, running from the dog.

      is cuts into scene. THE BOY'S MOM runs over. His back
      clawed up.BOY'S MOMGet him off! Get away--

      Chris rips the dog off by its collar. The dog snaps at
      him and in an instant he whips out his .45 to shoot it.TAYA (OC)No! He's a puppy. He doesn't know!

      Chris looks up, bent with animus, and he's looking at the
      face of his children, their friends, and their parents--

      They look at him, terrified. He releases the dog.
