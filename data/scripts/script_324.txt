           everything Gotham has been crying

          the same age and build as Dr. Pavel.

                         
          Bane rips Dr. Pavel's sleeve - pulls out a length of
          surgical tubing - pushes a needle into Dr. Pavel's arm -
          runs the tube to the body's arm... Dr. Pavel watches,

          Hooded Man 2 hands Bane his line. Bane clips it around Dr.
          Pavel, takes out a knife and cuts Dr. Pavel's seat belt. Dr.
          Pavel panics, flails. Bane takes his arms. Gentle.BANECalm, Doctor. Now is not time for

          Bane slides Dr. Pavel out of his seat. They hang in the
          vertical, windblown cabin. Bane takes out a detonator.BANEThat comes later.
          Bane presses the detonator - the cabin drops from around
          them, revealing the terrifying drop to the peaks below. Dr.

           turnaround. No city is without
           crime. But this city is without
           organized crime because the Dent
           Act gave law enforcement teeth in
           its fight against the mob. Now
           people are talking about repealing
           the Dent Act. And to them I

           days, when the criminals and
           corrupt ran this town with such a
           tight grasp that people put their
           faith in a murderous thug in a mask
           and a cape. A thug who showed his
           true nature when he betrayed the
           trust of this great man - (Turns to
           picture of Dent.) And murdered him
           in cold blood.

          sticks into the target - the Maid spins around, flustered.
          Wayne, at the other end of the long room, lowers a composite

           Goodnight, Mr. Wayne.
          She flips backwards through the window. Wayne smiles, then

          Batman sits into the cockpit, then looks again at Gordon.
           Anyone. A man doing something as
           simple and reassuring as putting a
           coat around a little boy's
           shoulders to let him know that the
           world hadn't ended...
          The canopy closes - and as the Bat fires up Gordon remembers-INSERT CUT: Gordon, in his uniform, wraps the overcoat
          around the Young Bruce's shoulders, his eyes reassuring,
          loving.
          Gordon looks up to the cockpit -GORDONBruce Wayne?
          - but is dusted by downdraft as the Bat RISES. Gordon LEAPS
          out of the way as the core is dragged along and out of the

          The Bat struggles with the weight of the smoking core... A

          The smallest of the boys stares through the window past
          Blake.LITTLE BOYNo. That's Batman!
          Blake turns to see the Bat thundering out of the heart of
          Gotham, trailing smoke, the core hanging from it. It curves
          dangerously close to the bridge before heading for the mouth
          of the river...the bay...the ocean...
          Until a point of light fires into an enormous nuclear BLAST
          - wind and light and dust blowing VIOLENTLY but harmlessly
          over the bridge, the tunnel mouth, all of Gotham...

                         
          As the nuclear dawn fades over Gotham, and we see its

          Gordon closes the book, looking down at Bruce Wayne's grave.
           'It is a far, far better rest that
           I go to than I have ever known.'

                         
          Gordon looks up at the figure standing across from him...
          Alfred. Tears streaming.
          Fox places a gentle hand on Alfred's shoulder, then leaves.
          Gordon and Blake follow. Alfred, alone with the Wayne
          family, turns to the grave beside Bruce's - the grave of
          Thomas and Martha Wayne.ALFREDI'm so sorry. I failed you. You
