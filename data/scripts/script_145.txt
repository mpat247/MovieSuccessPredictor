Jamie VanderbiltFIRST DRAFTMARCH 27, 2000OVER BLACK:The sound of HELICOPTER ROTORS slicing through the air.STYLES (O.S.)Jesus, God. . .FADE IN ON:An ARMY HELICOPTER as it soars over the thick LOUISIANA BAYOU.
Lush and green only a day ago, the foliage below has been
ripped to shreds. The kind of damage that can only be done
by nature.SUPERIMPOSE:, FEBRUARY 2 - 0630 HOURS - 32 KILOMETERS NORTHOF FORT MCKINLEY, LOUISIANAINT. ARMY HELICOPTER (FLYING) -- SUNRISESitting next to the PILOT is COLONEL WILLIAM STYLES. Mid-
40's, normally gruff, but completely cowed by the damage
below. The PILOT, unfazed.PILOTHurricane Beth, huh? Had    an ex-wife
          named Beth, this is pretty   much par
          for the course. This area    got the
          worst of it, I hope these   guys are
          all intact-STYLESThat's enough, Lieutenant.
SOMEONE'S P.O.V. - RUNNING through the underbrush - ducking
branches, pushing through bushes, splashing through streams.
LABORED BREATHING wheezes over the sound track. We're headed
for a CLEARING...INT. ARMY HELICOPTER (FLYING) -- SUNRISEThe Pilot pushes his stick forward, descending to tree level.PILOTComing up on the pick-up.EXT. CLEARING -- DAWNTWO MEN emerge from the underbrush at a run. The BIGGER MAN
carrying the wounded SMALLER MAN over his shoulder. Both in
ragged army cadet fatigues - ripped, muddy, and bloody.
The Bigger Man lowers the Smaller Man to the ground and
unshoulders his M-16. Face panicked.
The sound of the HELICOPTER approaching...2.INT. ARMY HELICOPTER (FLYING) -- SUNRISEThe unmistakable SOUND OF GUNFIRE from below.PILOTHoly shit, that's live fire!

As the Helicopter comes over the clearing, Styles and the
Pilot squint down through the windscreen to see the Two Men,
huddled together as BULLET HITS kick up DUST around them!STYLESWho's shooting at them-

The Bigger Man raising his own his weapon and RETURNING FIRE.
The Smaller Man frantically waving the Helicopter down...PILOTI can't see-

Below, the Bigger Man still shooting and then he lowers his
rifle and there's only SILENCE. No return fire.

And then Styles sees why. A THIRD MAN. Lying by the
treeline. Chest torn open by gunfire. Obviously dead. His
clothes - the same fatigues the first two men are wearing.STYLESThat was one of their own, he just
          Shot one of their own men-PILOTWho was trying to shoot them-STYLESGet us on the ground!EXT. CLEARING -- SUNRISEAs the Helicopter comes in for a landing, the Bigger Man
kneels next to the Smaller Man, who bleeds from a bullet
wound to the arm.  His face, pale, sweating. The Bigger Man
wipes the Smaller Man's brow and speaks softly and seriously.BIGGER MANAre you ready for this?

The Smaller Man nods.INT. ROADHOUSE -- MORNINGA full on shit-kicking dive.     Nearly empty, given the hour.
A TELEVISION plays the morning    news over the bar.  Only two
inhabitants - one a BARTENDER,    the other the lone CUSTOMER,
smoking and picking at a plate    of criminally runny eggs.3.HARDYTell the truth, Vic. You made these
          with a blender, right?
He grins and we get our first good look at
TOM HARDY - Three day stubble, dark rings around his eyes,
but a with strong jaw and steady voice. Not your average
barfly. Somebody who maybe used to be somebody.BARTENDERDon't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't
          make no damn difference to me.HARDYYou know that was like a quadruple
          negative?
The Bartender takes the plate away from him.HARDYCan I at least have a drink?BARTENDERIt's ten thirty in the morning.HARDYYeah, if you've slept.BARTENDERYou know the law - no liquor before
          noon. Could lose my license.HARDYDon't you mean "don't need no liquor
          license not taken away from me"?
The Bartender smiles.BARTENDERHurricane kept you up, too?HARDYYeah, and I could've used the sleep.
          I'm supposed to meet people here
          tonight, try and get some work going.
He stops, his attention suddenly on the TV.    A NEWSCASTER:NEWSCASTER...is expected to announce the grand
          jury indictments in the Guissepe
          Torres police corruption case as
          early as tomorrow afternoon.
          Speculations abound that up to ten
          former homicide detectives could be
          named in the proceedings-4.The Bartender turns the TV off hastily.   Embarrassed:BARTENDERSorry.
Hardy just looks away. The Bartender puts an empty glass
down and fills it to the lip with bourbon.
Hardy nods a "thank you" and reaches for the glass when the
PAGER on his hip goes off. He checks the number.HARDYBill Styles...BARTENDERWho?HARDYOld friend. Haven't talked to him
          in- 911. Can I use your phone?
The Bartender hands him a cordless and Hardy dials.HARDYHey, Bill, it's Tom. Long time no.
          . . whoa, whoa, slow down. Yeah...
          yeah, of course I'll come. An hour.
He hangs up and hands the phone back to the Bartender.BARTENDERWhat was that?
Hardy, obviously shaken by the call.HARDYI gotta go out to McKinley.EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- MORNINGEstablishing. A sprawling five square mile compound nestled
in the Louisiana backwoods. Also damaged by the Hurricane.
HELICOPTERS loaded with emergency supplies land and take
off, REPAIR CREWS work feverishly on damaged buildings, all
while CADET PLATOONS complete morning drills around them.
This is still a boot camp after all.SUPERIMPOSE: 1130 HOURS - FORT MCKINLEY BASIC TRAINING CENTEREXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- MAIN GATE -- MORNINGStyles stands waiting nervously just beyond the CHECKPOINT
with WARRANT OFFICER JULIA OSBORNE - early 30's, attractive,
close cropped hair and icy eyes. In the middle of protesting.5.OSBORNEThis is totally unnecessary-STYLESHe asked to see a policeman, we're
          getting him a policeman .OSBORNEBut this guy you called, he's not
          even Army-STYLESHe's former Army and the best I've
          ever seen in a room. Besides, he
          knows the territory, we did Basic
          together here.
              (off her look)
          You've had three hours with Dunbar
          and haven't gotten a peep, we need
          to take a different tack.OSBORNEHe's not Army, it's not official-STYLESThen it's unofficial.
He takes a hit from an ASTHMA INHALER, as a '71 PONTIAC GTO
drives through the gate and pulls up. Hardy emerges.OSBORNE(re: his appearance)
          Doesn't get any unofficialer than
          that...
The two old friends embrace.HARDYHow are you?STYLESBeen better.
              (pause)
          I read about what's been happening
          With you... I should have called-HARDYWhat kind of trouble are you in?
Styles looks at the ground.      Momentarily flustered.HARDYThat bad?STYLESWould I have called you if it wasn't?
          If there was any other way-6.HARDYTell me what I can do.OSBORNEYou can get us some answers.
Hardy takes off his sunglasses, noticing her.STYLESThis is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne,
          The closest thing we have to an in-
          House investigator.HARDYAnd here you are going out of house.
          How's that make you feel, Jules?OSBORNEHostile and uncooperative.HARDYFantastic.   You want to tell me what's
          going on?INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDORS MORNINGHardy follows Styles and Osborne. They pass SOLDIERS
replacing broken windows and sweeping up glass.STYLESThe official term for it is
          "Clusterfuck" . By the time Beth hit
          us, I'd canceled all off base
          exercises save one - a six man cadet
          team and their Drill out in the bush.
          We're missing three and the Sergeant.
          The cadets are in their eighth week
          of the cycle, nobody here knows much
          about them, up to and including their
          names. But the Sergeant...HARDYIt's not West, is it?    Tell me it's
          not West.
Styles' look tells him it is.HARDYAh, ChristOSBORNEYou knew Sergeant West?HARDYHe was our Drill here.    Man's older
          than sand.7.STYLESA few years ago, the Army picked our
          good buddy as their go to non-com to
          trot out to the press to talk about
          the kinder, gentler military. He
          even did the standard video greeting
          played to all incoming Basic cadets
          across the country.HARDYWell, he's a good soldier.
Osborne nods, agreeing.HARDYI didn't mean that as a compliment.OSBORNESergeant West's served for twenty-
          Three years. He's the public face
          of the modern Army.HARDYAnd you notice I'm not in the Army
          anymore.
They round a corner.STYLESThe exercise was one of his Section
          Eight "private sessions". Left around
          2100 yesterday and were scheduled
          for pick up at 0630 this morning.HARDYAnd the problem is you only got three.STYLESNo, the problem is one's dead, one's
          got a bullet in his arm, and one
          won't talk. The one who won't talk
          was trading live fire with the dead
          one as we reached the pick-up.HARDYI'm assuming that's what made him
          the dead one?STYLESCadet Roberto R. Nunez.   Killed right
          in front of me.OSBORNESearch parties for the others are
          fanning out in a ten click radius
          from the pickup. If they're hurt
          and we can get to them in time...8.STYLESI called the JAG Corps, the two cadets
          we retrieved are to be flown to D.C.
          On a transport leaving here at 1700-HARDYWhich gives us about five hours.
          Why'd you call me?STYLESThe guy in interrogation said he'd
          only talk to a cop.HARDYAnd I'm the closest thing to it,
          right?
Styles stops, turning to his friend.STYLESTom, bottom line: I let those kids
          go out there. If JAG shows up and I
          don't have any answers for them, my
          career is finished-HARDYI'm not gonna let that happen.
Styles exhales, relieved.STYLESThank you. Osborne will brief you
          on the cadets. And Tom?
              (half-smile)
          It really is good to see you.INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- OSBORNE'S OFFICE -- MORNINGOsborne and Hardy enter, stepping over broken glass and
hurricane debris. Hardy looks around.HARDYGotta be honest, I love what you've
          Done with the place-OSBORNEYou and the Colonel go back.HARDYHe got me through Basic and a lot of
          other stuff. I owe him.OSBORNEYou're the Tom Hardy I've been reading
          about in the papers, right? New
          Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes
          from Guissepe Torres.9.HARDYIt was for suspicion of bribery,
          it's really all in the wording-OSBORNEWording and your friendship with the
          Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable
          having you involved in this.HARDYSubtlety really isn't one of you
          finer points, is it, Osborne?
Osborne opens her mouth to reply but Hardy cuts her off.HARDYThree things. First - You don't
          have a choice. Second- I've never
          taken a bribe in my life. And Third -
          I'm still a little drunk from last
          night, so if I skip over the witty
          banter and move forward to straight
          hitting on you, try not to take
          offense. Tell me about the two guys.OSBORNEHurricane knocked out our Mainframe,
          so all we have are their dogtags.
          Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall-HARDYLevi?   Who names their kid Levi-OSB0RNESenator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.HARDYChrist... Remind me to thank Bill
          for mentioning that on the phone-OSBORNEKendall Junior is still  in surgery,
          so he won't be available  to answer
          for his name or anything  else for
          another hour - the cadet  we're talking
          to first is Dunbar.HARDYHe's in interrogation?OSBORNEYes.HARDYMove him.10.OSBORNEWhy?HARDYBecause interrogation rooms look
          suspiciously like interrogation rooms,
          which doesn't exactly put people at
          ease. Is he cute?OSBORNEExcuse me?HARDYIs Dunbar cute?OSBORNE(pissed)
          That is the most unprofessional-HARDYIs he handsome, self assured, carry
          himself well, does he look you in
          the eyes or down at the floor, does
          he have good bones, suggesting good
          breeding, does he slouch or sit up
          straight - these are important
          questions, as they reveal a great
          deal about this man's character so
          please get over yourself for two and
          a half seconds and tell me is he
          cute?
Osborne stares at him.    She finally nods.HARDYThank you. At some point in there
          I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do,
          go at him with everything you got.OSBORNEGood cop/bad cop?HARDYSomething like that.
She starts to go make preparations.HARDYOh, and Osborne? You have any donuts
          around here?INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDOR -- MORNINGAs two M.P.'s escort RAYMOND DUNBAR (the "Bigger Man") into11.INT. COFFEE ROOM -- MORNINGA small cluttered room with the shades drawn. A folding
table has been set up in the middle of it with a chair on
each side. Dunbar takes a seat in the far chair. Takes in
his surroundings as the MP's leave, locking the door.INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDOR - MORNINGHardy and Osborne head towards the Coffee Room.OSBORNEI questioned him for three hours and
          he didn't make a sound. You don't
          have a badge, he won't talk to you.HARDY,Ten bucks says I have him talking in
          under three minutes.
Osborne starts the timer on her digital watch.OSBORNEGo.INT. COFFEE ROOM -- MORNINGDunbar looks up as they enter.    Hardy smiles, cheerily.HARDYCadet Dunbar, good morning! I'm Tom
          Hardy and I believe you've already
          met Officer Osborne. I understand
          you had a rough time of it last night?
No response.    Hardy takes a seat across from the cadet.HARDYNot talking, huh? You probably just
          want to get some food and some sleep.
          They feed you yet?
No response.    Hardy reaches into his pocket.   Pulls out aDONUT.Dunbar eyes it, wary but definitely wanting it.HARDYGo on. You can eat in front of
          someone and still not talk to them -
          my parents did it for years.
Dunbar grabs the donut, wolfing it down.HARDYWant another one?
No response.    Osborne looks to her watch - it's been a minute.12.HARDYMaybe later. Ray, let me say this
          up front - I'm not a cop.
Dunbar turns away, no longer interested.   Hardy continues:HARDYI used to be, but that's beside the
          point. Who I am doesn't really
          matter; what matters is that right
          now, you're in a shitload of trouble.
          You understand that, right?
No response.HARDYNow, I don't know if you did what
          you did in self defense and frankly
          I don't really care. I'm just doing
          a favor for Colonel Styles because
          he wants to know if anyone else who's
          still out there is in need of
          assistance. To be honest with you,
          though, I don't care about that
          either.
Dunbar looks up at this, surprised.HARDYI don't know those guys, you do.
          They die, to me, it's like seeing a
          couple people died in a fire on the
          news - tragic, but it doesn't affect
          me. The only thing I care about is
          I agreed to do a favor for a friend
          and try and talk to you till your
          transpo shows up. You like baseball?
No response.   Osborne looks at her watch - two minutes.HARDYI could talk baseball for   days.
          Batting averages, ERA's, I   got
          statistics in my brain, I   don't know
          how I remember them. It's    freaky.
          You wanna talk baseball?
Dunbar, completely confused.HARDYCome on Ray, we're gonna be here
          five hours, we gotta talk about
          something. So who do you like?
A long silence and then:13.DUNBARI don't like baseball.
Hardy grins as Osborne stops her watch at 2:41.HARDYWhy not?DUNBARI asked for a policeman.HARDYYou're under military arrest, it's
          not gonna happen. What's wrong with
          baseball?DUNBARIt's... too slow.HARDYWell, it's a game of anticipation,
          that's the beauty.DUNBARI just don't like it.HARDYWhat do you like then?
As they continue, we TRACK under the table to reveal a HIDDENMICROPHONE...INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- MORNINGStyles and an M.P. listening to the Coffee Room conversation.
DUNBAR'S VOICE, over the speaker:DUNBAR (O.S.)I don't know... I like the Army.HARDY (O.S.)C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army
          during Basic. I'll tell you straight,
          I hated it here.INT. COFFEE ROOM -- MORNINGDUNBARYou did Basic here?HARDYFifteen years ago under Sergeant
          West. Piece of work, that guy. I
          remember, he used to have these two
          silver .45's with ivory handles and
          if you weren't quick enough, he'd(MORE)14.HARDY (CONT'D)knock you on the head with one of
             them. He still carry those guns?
He Dunbar nods.HARDYI was also his " knife dummy" .
                 (to Osborne)
             See, West used to say he could slit
             a man from stem to sternum in three
             seconds. He'd use this length of
             pipe to demonstrate and if you were
             the knife dummy, you'd spend all day
             getting a pipe rammed into your balls
             if you weren't fast enough to defend
             yourself. That was a loooong day.
Hardy laughs at the memory and turns back to Dunbar.HARDYIncidentally, Ray, I promised them
             I'd ask where West and the others
             are. Can we get to them?
He looks to the floor.DUNBARThere's no need...HARDYThey're dead, aren't they?
Dunbar looks back up at Hardy.DUNBARYeah.INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- MORNINGStyles lowers his head at this.INT. COFFEE ROOM -- MORNINGHARDYYou kill them?
No answer.    Hardy rubs his nose.   Osborne steps forward.OSBORNEThe Colonel saw you shoot Nunez,
             You're a murderer-HARDYSee, Ray, this is what we call "good
             cop, bad cop".(MORE)15.HARDYShe shouts, I stand up for you, you're
          grateful, a bond of trust is
          established.
Osborne, stunned by this.HARDYBut I don't want to play games.
          That's why you're not in an
          interrogation room, with one of those
          two way mirrors - everyone knows
          those things are two way, right?
Dunbar looks at him good nods slowly.HARDYRight. Now, I'm gonna go get you
          another donut and you think about
          whether you want to talk more, okay?DUNBAROkay.
Hardy smiles at him, gets up, and leaves.INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDOR -- MORNINGOsborne follows him out into the hall where Styles waits.OSBORNEBaseball?HARDYBelieve somebody owes me ten dollars-OSBORNEYou made me look like an idiot-HARDYOh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the
          object of the interrogation is to
          make you look good- Everyone knows
          good cop, bad cop - by admitting it
          I appeared trustworthy.STYLESYou think he did it?OSBORNENo-HARDYYes-
They stop, looking at each other.16.STYLESYou've got four hours and forty-five
          minutes to find out.INT. COFFEE ROOM -- MORNINGHardy returns, another donut in hand, Osborne behind him.HARDYWhy'd you ask for a cop, Ray?DUNBARI'm not telling you what happened.HARDYOkay... but I would like to know
          about the other cadets. What they
          were like - nice guys? Dunbar takes
          a deep breath.DUNBARSome.HARDYTell me about them.

As Dunbar begins to talk, we FLASHBACK...EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- PARADE GROUNDS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGORow upon row of freshly shaven headed CADETS stand at
attention. Their first day of boot camp.DUNBAR (V.O.)First day was when I met Pike.    Sarge
          hated him from the beginning.

A man with a face of granite strides up and down the lines.

Two ivory handled pistols on his hips. His lifeless cobalt
blue eyes take in the Cadets. This is SERGEANT WEST.WESTYou motherfuckers have just made the
          worst mistake of your lives! You
          have chosen to join my Army! This
          Army is my mother, my father, and my
          little virgin sister and I will not
          allow anyone or anything that is not
          up to my standards near her pretty
          little virgin cooze, do you understand
          me - give me a sir, yes, sir!THE CADETSSir, yes, sir!17.WESTThose who I deem unworthy to pass
          through this camp will quit, and
          those who refuse to quit I will kill.
          You ever hear of a training accident -
          Give me a sir, yes, sir!THE CADETSSir, yes, sir!WESTIn my time I have killed sixteen men
          for the good of my country, sixteen
          men whose entrance into this Army I
          could not condone, as it would weaken
          the fabric of this nation's defense!
          This base suffers an average of three
          training accidents a year, unfortunate
          incidents that I will not hesitate
          to repeat if you cross me, understand -
          Give me a sir, yes, sir!THE CADETSSir, yes, sir!WESTSo forget what you've seen on Sixty
          fucking Minutes about the kinder,
          gentler military - you will either
          succeed, quit, or die by my hand!
He walks over to a tall black cadet in the front row.   PIKE.WESTMy power here is absolute, isn't
          that right, nigger?PIKESir, yes, sir!
West hauls off and SLAPS Pike across the face!WESTI hail from Biloxi, Mississippi where

          tree branches when the mood strikes
          us you have a problem with that?PIKESir, no, sir!
West grabs Pike by the neck, CHOKING HIM. The others Cadets
GASP. Pike goes down on his knees, the loss of air is so
great. He reaches up automatically to try and save himself...18.WESTWhat the fuck is this? You lay a
          hand on me while I'm trying to do my
          duty and rid the world of you?
He KICKS PIKE IN THE BALLS and releases him. Pike goes fetal
on the ground, VOMITING, as West stands over him, screaming.WESTGet the fuck up, you're still in
          formation, get the fuck up!
Pike somehow gets to his feet, vomit streaking his clothes.WESTWhat the fuck have you done to that
          uniform, take it off, take it off,
          take it off!
Pike, still gasping, can't move fast enough.    West slaps him
again and tears the man's shirt off.WESTGet those fucking pants off, I want
          you buck ass naked, you don't deserve
          to wear these beautiful United States
          Army issue clothes!
Pike struggles off the rest of his clothes until he is NAKED.
West turns and spies Dunbar in the line.WESTCadet, what's your name!DUNBARSir, Dunbar, sir!WESTYou know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?DUNBARSir, yes, sir!
West draws one of his PISTOLS and gives it to him.WESTDunbar you are to stand here and
          guard this nigger for the next twenty-
          four hours! He is not to be given
          food, water, or clothes! If he so
          much as moves, you are to blow his
          nigger brains out, is that clear?DUNBARSir, yes, sir!19.WESTThe rest of you, fallout for
          physicals!
The rest of the Cadets fallout, following West away to one
of the buildings, leaving Dunbar and Pike.

the log. Screaming, West dives into the pit and pulls
Anderson out, knocking him on the head with a pistol.EXT. TARMAC -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- AFTERNOONAnderson stands naked, his arms straining to hold up,TWO

          guys got to turn in.EXT. PARADE GROUNDS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- MORNINGThe Cadet Corps, mustered. West zeroes in on NUNEZ (the
"dead one"), whose t-shirt has a spot on it.DUNBAR (V.O.)Fellas lived in daily fear of being
          Sectioned and with good reason, too.
West pulls Nunez out of line by his ear and kicks him over
towards a separate muster of our Four Section Eighters.DUNBARThey figured we were the boys who'd
          meet with a "training accident" .
Nunez takes a place among them.   Looking absolutely terrified.INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAYOsborne leans forward.OSBORNEAre you saying Sergeant West tried
          to kill you?DUNBARNo, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit.
          Making it through was kind of an
          honor. Some of the other guys on
          the base told us that if you could
          hack Section Eight, Command would
          consider you at the top of the class.HARDYThat's not exactly true...
              (off their looks)
          I'm living proof. How did you get
          Sectioned, Ray?21.Dunbar gives a look that almost resembles a smile.DUNBARThat first night with Pike. I made

          ones West weeded out.DUNBARThere were six of us...EXT. OBSTACLE COURSE.-- ONE WEEK AGO -- EVENINGThe six members of Section Eight on a forced run through the
rain. We focus in each face as Dunbar describes them. First
up is MUELLER a tall Aryan looking blonde with a square jaw.DUNBAR (V.O.)Mueller was from Tulsa, a real good
          ol' boy type. One of those "his
          Daddy's Daddy's Daddy died at Bull
          Run and no bleeding heart Yankee was
          gonna take away his scatter gun" .
          He idolized West.
Muller, grinning, as West kicks his ass to pick up the pace.
Next to him is NUNEZ, a strapping hulk of a manchild.DUNBAR (V.O.)And Nunez idolized Mueller. Big
          fella from New Mexico. After he got
          Sectioned he just followed Mueller
          around like a lap dog. He wasn't
          mean like Mueller, though, didn't
          have it in him.
Next to Nunez is CHILDS, small and weasely with feral eyes.DUNBAR (V.O.)But Childs did. Didn't talk to
          anyone, but you got this feeling
          something was wrong with him, like
          real wrong. Type of guy you felt
          uncomfortable going to sleep near.
Behind Childs runs Pike.DUNBAR (V.O.)Pike I told you about. He took the
          brunt of it from Mueller and West.
          Once they found it out he was a
          convict they were merciless.(MORE)22.DUNBAR (V.O.) (CONT'D)He'd been busted for Auto Theft,
          judge gave him the option of jailor
          the Army. He made the wrong choice.
Next to Pike, Dunbar and KENDALL run side by side.   Kendall
is short like Childs, but also weak. Wheezing.DUNBARFinally Kendall and me. Kendall was
          a smart guy, we got along okay.
          Pike and I tried to help him, but...
Kendall falters and Pike stops to try and help him up. West
smacks the him away, practically kicking Kendall to his feet.DUNBAR (V.O.)He was sickly. Had that shaking
          thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?OSBORNE (V.O.)Epilepsy.DUNBAR (V.O.)Yeah. Spent half his time in the
          infirmary. Only reason he enlisted
          was his father. West didn't section
          him till last week.INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAYHARDYAnd those were the guys who went on

Hardy leans back in his chair.HARDYYou smoke, Ray?DUNBARThis is one of those interrogation
          tricks, isn't it? You don't give me
          a cigarette till I tell you more.HARDYNo, actually, I just left mine in
          the car and was hoping you had some.
Dunbar studies him for a moment and then pulls a pack of
Dorals from his pocket and puts them on the table.HARDYMy brand.   Must be my lucky day.23.He takes one and lights it.      Dunbar does the same.HARDYLet me ask you one thing. You seem
          like a good guy, Ray. You carried
          Kendall wounded to the pickup. So
          what I don't get is what you did to
          make Nunez want to kill you?

rumbles across the grounds, headed towards the Base Hospital.
They sit in silence until:HARDYWhy'd you join the army?
Osborne looks at him, annoyed.OSBORNEYou really want to make banal chit-
          Chat like that now?HARDYYou're right. We should sit in
          silence.OSBORNEWe're in the middle of a murder case-HARDYBest time for banal chit-chat.
He slips something into his pocket.OSBORNEWhat is that?24.HARDYMicrorecorder for Kendall - didn't
          have- time to wire his room. Now
          tell me why you joined the army or
          I'll jab this pen through your neck.
Osborne smiles in spite of, herself.OSBORNETypical army brat story. Dad was
          noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was
          never any real doubt of joining up.HARDYYou had a mobile of bayonets above
          your crib.OSBORNESomething like that.     You?HARDYI lost a bet.
Osborne laughs.OSBORNEYou're kidding.HARDYYeah. That's just the story I tell
          the girls to get them into bed.
          Truth is... I don't know. The whole
          honor and duty thing. Make a
          difference in the world, crap like
          that. Didn't really work out.
Osborne studies him.OSBORNEI bet    that's the second story you
          tell    the girls to get them into bed,
          after    you make them laugh with the
          first    one.
Hardy just smiles.OSBORNEThis is the straight hitting on me
          you were talking about, isn't it?HARDYThe very same.OSBORNEYou do understand that there's
          absolutely no way I could ever be
          attracted to you, right?25.HARDYI plan to grow on you.OSBORNEYou're off to a late start.HARDYSo noted.

          out of you here.OSBORNEImagine what it must have been like
          for them out there. What do you

          We feel this incident may have put
          the beaches of Florida at risk.
Kendall's laugh turns into a cough.   Placing Hardy.KENDALLThat's it. You're that policeman
          with friends in low places. Tell
          me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these
          days? Those racketeering indictments
          must have really been a downer-HARDYLevi, you got about four hours before
          armed men show up here, put you on a
          plane to Washington, and lock you in
          a very small dark room.  I suggest
          you talk to us.
Kendall smiles again, not losing any of his cool.KENDALLI've done nothing wrong.
              (gestures to his wound)
          I'm the victim here.HARDYBut not the only victim, right?KENDALLMy, my, my, how did things turn so

          are degrees of truth, officer, always

Hardy stares at him for a moment and then gets up to leave.HARDYIt's too early in the day for me to
          give a shit about some pissant cadet's
          bad version of "intrigue". You want
          to talk to us, send word over to the
          brig. Let's go.
Nonplussed, Osborne follows.    Hardy turns back at the door.HARDYYou're working too hard, Levi. I
          can tell cause you're sweating. And
          you're sweating cause you have no

          Thought you didn't have cigarettes-HARDYI lied.   Wait for it...

Kendall nods.HARDYAnd the other three Cadets?
Kendall hesitates, then nods again.HARDYFeel free to elaborate .
Kendall takes a breath and begins, all trace of bravado gone.KENDALLMy father is a powerful man. Over
          the years he's used that power to
          protect me, in one form or another,
          from certain... unpleasantries.

          I am a homosexual.HARDYSenator Daddy must be thrilled.KENDALLHe is not, shall we say, wild about
          the idea. He has asked me on numerous
          occasions to be more discreet about
          my proclivities, and I have done my
          best to oblige him. However, in the
          last four weeks, I began a
          relationship with another cadet.
          What do you think of that?HARDYI think you just blew "Don't Ask,
          Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.KENDALLThe Sergeant discovered this
          relationship and wanted me expelled.
          My father interceded, so instead,
          West Sectioned me and made sure every
          other cadet knew that I was gay.OSBORNEHe couldn't kick you out so he wanted

          the PX together.
The wind is picking up and it's started to RAIN.   Their
ponchos flap loudly against the elements.KENDALL (V.O.)I started getting it in my head that
          maybe West had paid him, maybe he
          was the one who was supposed to give
          me a training accident-
The ROAR of GUNFIRE!  Kendall turns  towards it,  SCREAMING
for a moment... Until he sees Childs  lower his  smoking rifle,
a SHREDDED TARGET on a tree in front  of them.   He looks down,

VARIOUS SHOTS -- Kendall and Childs, moving through the bayou,
Childs taking out targets. It's raining harder now.KENDALL (V.O.)All I could think of was West, out

Childs speaks, and Kendall almost jumps out of his skin.CHILDSChrist, am I alone in this world?
          Shoot something-

Into DARKNESS. No target, no West, no nothing. Kendall,

          me, okay? I'll take care of this.

Kendall nods and lets Childs walk ahead. Staring at Childs'
back as they move on. On Kendall's face, thinking...KENDALL (V.O.)Maybe it was a trick. Maybe this
          was when they'd get me, when I felt

            scared at all. But I was...
                (long pause)
            Enough to almost kill him.HARDYBut you didn't.KENDALLNo.    Poetic justice, though.OSBORNEWhy?
No reply.   Hardy smiles, understanding.HARDYBecause Childs is the one who shot
            you.
Osborne looks up, surprised.           Kendall nods.KENDALLBut that came later.EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- LAST NIGHTAs Kendall safeties his rifle and lowers it... The SOUND of
a tremendous EXPLOSION comes from their right! Kendall and
Childs knocked off their feet as the sky momentarily LIGHTS
UP with the blast as a MAN SCREAMS!CHILDSOver there!
Childs points to the right, where the dim shine of PHOSPHOROUS
can be seen through the trees. He drags Kendall to his feet
and the two take off running towards it.
Kendall panting and scared, ducking branches and leaping
ditches as the two sprint towards the dying glow.CHILDSHello!    HEL-35.The sound of GUNFIRE!   Childs TACKLES Kendall...CHILDSGET DOWN!They hit the deck, face down in mud. It takes them a second
to realize the shots are not directed at them.CHILDSFuck, what the fuck is going on-KENDALLWhat do we do?CHILDSWhoever it is isn't shooting at us...
He trails off. The gunfire and screaming have stopped.
Silence now, save for the wind and rain.KENDALLDon't want to go-CHILDSFine.
Childs rises and heads towards where the sounds were.
Kendall, lying in the rain and mud, shivering.    Alone.   After
a moment he gets up and follows.EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED,-- LAST NIGHTThe SCORCHED GROUND and TREES smolder under the rainfall.
Kendall finds Childs, standing down by the creek.
Something lies by his feet.KENDALLWhat's-
He stops, seeing.KENDALLOh, Jesus.. .
WEST. Literally spread out on the ground, dead. Eyes open,
face half blackened, he has been ripped in two at the torso.
A horrifying sight. Kendall stumbles back from it.KENDALLDid- Did you-CHILDSIt was the grenade you fucking idiot.
          Look at him!36.Kendall can't.   He sits, sobbing.   Part horror, part relief.CHILDSThis isn't our area.   Whose area is
          This-MUELLERCan anybody hear me!
Childs pivots at the sound of Mueller coming over the ridge.MUELLERHey, I-
              (seeing it)
          Holy fuck. .,. holy fuck, what the
          fuck did you guys do?CHILDSWe found him like this-
Mueller raises his rifle at the weeping Kendall.MUELLERYou killed him you fucking faggot-CHILDSWe found him like this! Kendall was
          with me the whole- Listen to me!
Mueller, finally seeming to understand.    Lowering the gun.MUELLERJesus, Jesus fucking Christ...
Muttering to himself, walking in circles.CHILDSWhere's Pike?
No response.CHILDSMueller, where's Pike?
Mueller looks up.MUELLERWe got- I don't know, we got separatedCHILDSBefore or after the explosion?
              (no response)
          Mueller-MUELLERI don't know!37.KENDALLHow can you not know-
Mueller comes at him, screaming:MUELLERShut the fuck up, you fucking faggot,
          You just shut the FUCK UP-CHILDSHEY!Mueller stops, eyes crazed. Childs looks to the sky, which
is becoming worse by the second.CHILDSWe have to get out of this.    To find
          the cabin.
He helps Kendall to his feet.KENDALLWhat about Pike?CHILDSMaybe he'll be there.    Either way,
          we have to go.
Kendall nods, slowly.   The two start up the hill.MUELLERShouldn't we- I mean, we shouldn't
          just leave him here.
He points down to West's body.    Childs looks at it.CHILDSYou can carry him if you want.
He and Kendall continue on. Mueller lingers a moment longer
and then turns, following them up the hill.EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- LAST NIGHTKendall, Childs, and Mueller make their way through the bush.
The WIND and RAIN have conspired into a FULL BLOWN HURRICANE.
The three men are practically stumbling now, leaning in
against it to stay on their feet. Kendall spies something
through the maelstrom. It looks like WET WOOD. He points:KENDALLThere!
THE CABIN -- Wooden, one story, and large, it resembles a
solidly built shack. It is being thrashed by the storm.38.The trio stumble towards the front door...INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHTObviously abandoned. Bare of any furniture save for two
wooden chairs next to an empty fireplace.
DUNBAR and NUNEZ shout in surprise as the three men
practically collapse into the cabin. Dunbar runs to bolt
the door against the elements as Nunez helps them up.NUNEZWhat happened to you-MUELLERWhat happened to you?DUNBARWe finished the course and came here,
          Then heard an explosion-
              (to Mueller)
          Where's Pike?CHILDSWe don't know. West is dead.
Silence. Dunbar and Nunez stare at him.    Mueller jerks a
hand towards Kendall and Childs.MUELLERThey found him. Poor fucker was
          Practically blown in half-KENDALLPoor fucker my ass...MUELLERYou better watch it, faggot, I'm not
          Sure you and Childs didn't do him-CHILDSWhat about you, wandering around
          Alone? At least we have an alibi-DUNBARWhat do you mean, alone?MUELLERPike and I got separated-KENDALLYeah and he doesn't know when-MUELLERI remember now, it was before the
          Explosion-39.KENDALLOh, you remember now-MUELLERI'm about two seconds away from seeing
          If fairies really can fly-NUNEZWhat about Pike?
Mueller stops, as the others turn towards the big man.
Silence. They realize what the question means.DUNBARHe wouldn't kill anybody. . .MUELLEROh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict.
          You know how much he hated West-DUNBARI hated West, Childs hated West,
          everyone with a goddamn brain hated
          West but that doesn't mean we killed
          him!NUNEZWhat if it wasn't one of us?    What
          if it was a local-KENDALLHe was blown up by a phosphorous
          grenade, they don't exactly sell
          those at 7-11.MUELLERLook, here are the facts - Roberto
          was with Dunbar, Queen Kendall was
          with Childs, and Pike's the only one
          not here. He did it!
The others nod, becoming convinced.CHILDSHe is the only one unaccounted for.KENDALLMaybe he's dead too.    Maybe you killed
          Them both, Mueller-DUNBARShut up.
              (to Mueller)
          Let me see your grenades.MUELLERWhy?40.DUNBARWe were each given three so whoever
          killed West will be missing one.
Mueller angrily digs into his sack and pulls out his grenades.MUELLERSee?   Three.     Now can we please-
He stops. Hearing a SOUND outside.        Through the wind and
rain, FOOTSTEPS on the porch.
They all turn to the door.       Waiting...
The DOOR SWINGS OPEN.. Pike.       Covered in BLOOD.PIKEHey, guys.
They stare at him as he calmly closes the door and walks
over to the empty FIREPLACE. Finally:DUNBARWhose blood is that, Jay?       West's.PIKEAny kindling for afire?
He looks around for kindling.       A beat.DUNBARWhat do you mean, West's?PIKEI mean I killed him.
              (pause)
          Isn't that what we all wanted?INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAYHARDYHe admitted it.KENDALLRight in front of us. Mueller went
          after him but we held him back.
          Pike surrendered and volunteered to
          be tied up. So we roped him to a
          chair and tried to ride out the storm.OSBORNEWhy would he just surrender?
Kendall turns to her and smiles.KENDALLBecause he had a plan.41.INT. CABIN -- LIVING ROOM -- LAST NIGHTPike, tied to a chair by the fireplace while the others look
for, food in the KITCHEN. Alone, Kendall walks past Pike:PIKEHey, Kendall, talk to you for a sec?
Kendall looks around - there seems no harm in it.PIKEYou hated West as much as I did.
          I'm not saying what I did was right,
          but you can't tell me you're not
          glad the motherfucker's dead.
Kendall says nothing. Pike looks around, makes sure no one
is listening and then whispers:PIKEThe thing is, we've got a real
          opportunity here. You turn me in
          Tomorrow and we're both fucked-KENOALLWhat are you talking about?PIKEA gay Senator's son who let his Sarge
          get fragged on a training exercise?
          The press'll crucify you and your

          it'll be your fault. But we do this
          different and you come out a hero.
On Kendall, thinking about it.    A beat.KENOALLHow?PIKEMueller.    He's as bad as West and we
          both know   it. Now I can't do it,

          others to   go along-KENDALLDon't think I want to hear this-PIKESomeone else can do the deed, it
          doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez
          too, he's got a tendency to follow
          Mueller, but the rest of us can come
          out ahead - the guys who took out

Kendall stares at him.   Disgusted.KENDALLYou're sick, Pike.
He turns and walks away.   Pike watches him go.KENDALL (V.O.)Later on I.saw him talking to Dunbar.

SOUND OF THE DOOR and FIRING...
Kendall's arm, HIT with a SLUG, and he starts to go down...
FREEZE-FRAME -- On Kendall's form, falling.KENDALL (V.O.)I don't think he meant to do it. It

next to them. Someone   is chasing them. Trying to kill them.
Nunez.43.Dunbar bobs and weaves as another volley of bullets comes
from behind and we can now hear ROTOR BLADES APPROACHING...EXT. CLEARING -- DAWNAs Dunbar bursts into the sunlight, carrying Kendall.

           When I came out, Mueller and Pike
           were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit
           and Dunbar was gone.HARDYWhy did he come back for you?KENDALLI honestly don't know. Maybe to
           have someone to cover for him. And
           I wish I could, but there's no doubt
           in my mind he killed those men.
Silence.   Kendall's got nothing more to say.HARDYOkay. I think that's it.     He rises
           and walks to the door.KENDALLMr. Hardy?

          an investigator?OSBORNEI don't think that has anything to
          do with-HARDYThat means under a year. Let me
          explain what ten years of police
          work has taught me - murder is basic.
          There are no conspiracies, no grand
          mysteries, and no evil puppet masters
          behind it all, pulling the strings;
          murder is shitty people doing a shitty
          thing to other shitty people - it
          doesn't always make sense but it's
          always neat. Dunbar's our guy.

Osborne struggles to put it into words.OSBORNEI just... He came back for Kendall.
          I don't think he's capable of murder.HARDYEveryone's capable of murder, Osborne.

Osborne turns, making her case to Styles.45.OSBORNELook, all we've got is what Kendall
          says, and he didn't actually witness
          any deaths except Nunez. He found
          West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but
          just their bodies - he didn't see

Dunbar stares at him.DUNBARYou think you know everything, don't
          you? You haven't even scratched the
          surface.
Hardy leans across the table, looks Dunbar dead in the eye.HARDYI know enough to know you got two
          choices - you can sign a confession,
          in which case you'll probably spend
          the rest of your life in a military

Dunbar stares at him for a moment and then LAUNCHES HIMSELF
at Hardy, SCREAMING. Tackles him to the floor, CHOKING HIM...

A beat.PIKEWhat?
Silence.   All of them staring at Pike.DUNBARWhere have you been, Jay?
Pike, suddenly understanding.      Fear creeping into his face.PIKEOh, no. . . no, fuck that-
He moves to the door, but. . .NUNEZHey!
Nunez, with his PISTOL out.      Trained on Pike.PIKERoberto, what the fuck?DUNBARWe just want to check your pack-PIKEWhy?MUELLERWhoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade
           first-PIKEBlame the nigger, then, huh? Someone
           turns up dead, you just look for the
           Darkest face in the crowd-DUNBARYou know it's not like that-54.PIKEDo I?
The CLICK as Nunez pulls back the pistol's hammer.NUNEZLet him check your pack.
Pike stares at them and then throws his pack down, angrily.
Dunbar goes to it, opens it, and reaches in. Pulls his hand
out. Only TWO GRENADES. Looks at Pike. Sadly.DUNBARTie him up.INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHTLater. The fury of the storm has increased. Kendall, Childs,
Nunez, and Mueller, in the KITCHEN looking for food.IN THE LIVING ROOMPike, tied to the chair. Dunbar sitting in a corner,
listening to the hurricane rage outside. Pike watches him.PIKEJust like the first day, huh?    You
            standing guard on me.
A CREAKING as the cabin SHIFTS on it's foundation.   Dunbar
looks up at the roof, scared. It holds.PIKEThis place ain't gonna hold much
            longer.
Dunbar doesn't reply. Still staring nervously at the roof.
Pike looks to make sure the others out of earshot, then:PIKEYou and me are friends, right?
No reply.PIKERight?DUNBARYeah...
Pike takes a deep breath.PIKEYou gotta untie me.
                (off Dunbar's look)
            I didn't do this thing, Ray.55.DUNBARYou hated West more than any of us.PIKEMaybe, but that don't make me a killer-DUNBARYou're the only one missing a grenade.PIKEWhich anyone coulda taken out of my
          gear on the chopper. Were you
          watching your pack on the ride in?
Dunbar starts to get up.PIKERay, this is my life    here. I ain't
          gonna pretend I'm not    happy West is
          gone, but you know I    couldn't have
          done this. It's not     in me.DUNBARIf not you, then who?PIKEMueller.DUNBAROh, come on-PIKEWe're sweeping our area and suddenly
          he's gone. Couple minutes later,
          phosphorous grenade pops off about a
          third of a click away-DUNBARThat's exactly what he says about
          you.PIKEWho you gonna trust, Ray?    Him or
          your friend?
Dunbar stares at him.DUNBARYou hated West, Mueller loved him-PIKEEnough to go to prison? Childs' PX
          Scam, Mueller was in on it-DUNBARBullshit.56.PIKELook in my pack.DUNBARWhy?PIKEJust look.   Little pocket.
Dunbar walks over to Pike's pack and unzips it.    Checks the
little pocket. Pulls out a VIAL and a SYRINGE.PIKECombat grade morphine.    Mueller sold
          it to me. .DUNBARYou're lying-PIKEPull up my sleeve.    Right arm.
Dunbar does to reveal a cluster of TRACK MARKS.PIKEThat look like a lie to you? I been
          using solid for the last eight weeks.
Dunbar sits down.   Not knowing what to say.PIKEAfter that first night on the parade
          Grounds with you, I was bad -
          Exposure, malnutrition, the works.
          I needed something to keep me from
          crashing. Mueller found me.INT. CADET SHOWERS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGOEmpty except for Pike. He sits, nude, curled up on the tile,
as the nozzles blast STEAMING WATER down onto his shivering
form. FOOTSTEPS approaching. Mueller. He leans down next
to Pike, speaking to him. Kindly.PIKE (V.O.)He said he knew guy who had an in at
          the PX, could hook me up. This is
          before I knew what a dick he was.
As Mueller produces a SYRINGE from his pocket...INT. BASE PX -- BACKROOM -- SIX WEEKS AGOA covert meeting among stacks of supplies. Childs stands
with Mueller, talking to a gaunt Pike. Behind Pike are a
group of other SICKLY LOOKING CADETS, all jonesing.57.PIKELater on Childs got assigned there,
           started running the shit out to every
           cadet who needed it. But I was our
           class's first customer.. .
Pike hands the smiling Mueller a WAD OF CASH...INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHTDunbar staring open mouthed at Pike.    Shocked.DUNBARWhy... why didn't you tell me?PIKEBecoming a morphine addict during
           Basic ain't exactly something you
           want to broadcast. Only Mueller and
           Childs know.
A beat.   Dunbar gets to his feet.DUNBARThat still doesn't mean you didn't
           kill him.PIKEYou saw West, right?   How was he
           killed?DUNBARFull clip to the body-PIKEFrom up close or far away?DUNBARHis chest was hamburger-PIKEThat's close range. You go full
           auto on a guy from close range, you're
           gonna be swimming in blood. Look at
           my uniform. Nothing.
Dunbar looks.   Not a speck of blood on it.PIKEAnd where's Mueller's? When I came
           in, he was only wearing a t-shirt.
Dunbar looks over to fireplace, where ashes are smoldering...
FLASHCUT TO - When Dunbar first entered the Cabin: Mueller,
standing there in a T-SHIRT, a FIRE burning in the hearth.58.PIKEWay I figure it, West must have found
          out about their little business and
          was gonna bust them, so they decided
          to get rid of him first...DUNBAR(softly)

extracts a phosphorous grenade.EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- EARLIER LAST NIGHTMueller and Pike, twenty feet apart, scouring the brush for
targets. Mueller looks to Pike and then slips away...PIKE (V.O.)Then Mueller ditches me during the
          exercise and heads for the creek.EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED,-- EARLIER LAST NIGHTMueller stands on the hill and pulls the grenades pin, tossing
it down the embankment. ..PIKE (V.O.)He blows the grenade to frame me and

Mueller runs down the embankment toward him.59.MUELLERDon't know, sir, I-
Six feet away from West, Mueller suddenly raises his rifle
and PULLS THE TRIGGER.EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- EARLIER LAST NIGHTKendall and Childs, running in the direction of the grenade...PIKEChilds' job is easy, he only has to

stands over WEST'S DEAD BODY. He turns and runs off INTO
THE BRUSH. A moment later, Childs and Kendall come into

          of the evidence...INT. CABIN -- EARLIER LAST NIGHTMueller, still covered in blood, enters the dark cabin. He
strips of his shirt and throws it in the fireplace. Striking
a match, igniting the bloody rag... .PIKE (V.O.)And wait for everyone else to arrive.
Mueller, watching the evidence burn...INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHTPike sighs, finished with his story.DUNBARI... I don't know...PIKEWhat don't you know?DUNBARThis is a lot of information to be
          Getting... I have to think-60.The hurricane outside GROWING LOUDER as the Cabin ROCKS again.
The sound of WOOD SNAPPING. Pike stares up at the roof.PIKEThere's no time to think, Ray, we
          gotta get out of here! You untie
          me, we grab the guns, get Kendall
          and Nunez, and make a run for it-DUNBARNo... no, we can just wait till we
          get back and then tell the M.P.'s-PIKEWe wait and I'm a dead man. I got a
          black face, a criminal record, and
          over a hundred other cadets who'll
          testify how much I hated West - my
          court martial will take six minutes.
          It's either me or them, Ray, and you
          gotta decide right now.
The cabin SHIFTS again.     Dunbar stares at him.PIKEUntie me.
Dunbar doesn't move.PIKEUntie me, Ray.
A long beat.   The two men stare at each other.
And then Dunbar pulls his knife from his boot and leans down
to cut Pike's bonds.PIKEThank God. . .MUELLER (O.S.)What the fuck are you doing?
Dunbar freezes.   Caught.
He looks to the open kitchen door where Mueller stands.MUELLERGuys, get out here!
The others enter the room. Dunbar, kneeling there, knife
inches away from severing Pike's ropes.PIKEThis place is going, Mueller.     We
          gotta move-61.MUELLERShut the fuck up.
              (to the others)
          He was gonna cut him loose.
The others stare at Dunbar.NUNEZWhy?PIKECause I didn't do it.
Childs motions to Dunbar.CHILDSGet away from there.
He's serious.    Dunbar moves away from Pike.MUELLERWe all know what you did, Pike. I
          don't know what kind of nigger voodoo
          You been working in here, but-PIKEWhere's your shirt, Mueller?MUELLERUsed it to start the fire-PIKEStill got mine on, not a speck of
          blood on it. Not a bad trick for a
          murderer- you said you burned yours?
The others begin to look at Mueller with new eyes.MUELLERWas freezing from the hurricane-KENDALLSo you took off your shirt?MUELLERTo start a fire, goddammit!
              (pointing to Pike)
          What about him, huh? Maybe he offed
          the Sarge and changed shirts, brought
          an extra one in his pack. Y'ever
          think of that? Go ahead, cut him
          loose! First chance he gets, he'll
          waste the rest of us, that's how
          they work-
The hurricane, reaching FEVER PITCH outside as WATER begins
leaking in through the roof.62.PIKEGoddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of
          Here-MUELLERWe're not going anywhere.PIKE TURNS TO MUELLER:PIKECadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place
          you under military arrest for the

          I saw you do it-
And Mueller FIRES.
Pike's head SNAPS BACK.
The gunshot, DEAFENING.    Then, for an eternity, SILENCE.
Nobody moves.   Nobody breathes.   As if time has stopped.KENDALLOh.. . my God...
Mueller lowers his arm, the pistol clattering to the floor.
His face, as shocked as the others.MUELLERHe wouldn't... stop talking...
He takes a step forward towards Pike.    A hole in the middle
of the black man's forehead.DUNBAR(softly)
          So you killed him?MUELLERI. . .Almost mechanically, Dunbar begins to reach for his own gun...
The unmistakable sound of a two rifles' magazines being RACKED
simultaneously. Dunbar turns to see Childs and Nunez, their
M-16's in hand. Levelled at him.CHILDSGet that hand away.
Dunbar does.    Looks to Nunez.DUNBARYou too?64.CHILDSWe can still come out of this okay.
          Pike got free, he got a gun, he came
          after us. That's the story.
Mueller collapses on the ground.   Head in hands.MUELLERWest was one thing, but this-CHILDSShut up, Mueller.KENDALLYou framed-him...CHILDSNone of that matters now. We got
          two dead bodies and a story that
          explains them. You're either with
          us, or against us - which is it?
Dunbar and Kendall, looking at each other. It's clear what
the wrong answer will mean. A long beat, untilKENDALLOkay-
He is cut off as the WIND outside ROARS - the HURRICANE
mounting to it's FULL FORCE - and the WINDOWS BLOW INWARDS,
showering Childs, Mueller, and Nunez with glass!
Dunbar's hand flies to his pistol, PULLING IT...
Mueller, SCREAMING, trying to claw the glass from his EYES...
Childs, seeing Dunbar move, PULLS THE TRIGGER. .. .
And the cabin is filled with the THUNDER OF GUNFIRE as Kendall
goes down, clutching his ARM...
DUNBAR FIRES, hitting Childs directly in the chest...
Childs, still shooting, falls back, his random spray of
bullets PUNCHING INTO MUELLER who jerks like a marionette...
Nunez, drawing a bead on Dunbar, about to shoot, when...
A great CRESCENDO of WOOD SPLINTERING and SUPPORTS BUCKLING
overtakes them and the CABIN'S ROOF COMES DOWN ON THEIR HEADS.EXT. DEMOLISHED CABIN -- FIRST LIGHTHours later. The rain has lessened and the Hurricane has
begun to lift as Dunbar pulls himself from the debris.
Hearing a FAINT CRY from his left.65.Kendall.   Half conscious, his arm, bloody.
Dunbar slings the man across his shoulders as the rising sun
begins to peak through the clouds overhead.EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- SUNRISEDunbar, carrying Kendall towards the clearing when GUNFIRE
comes from behind. He turns to look...
Nunez. The only other survivor from the Cabin. A hundred
yards back, rifle in hand, coming after them with a vengeance.
Dunbar, sprinting towards the clearing, bullets at his heels
and as he bursts from the tree line he looks up to see aHELICOPTER OVERHEADDUNBAR (V.O.)And then I killed the last of them.
FLASHCUT TO - Nunez, chest blown open, going down...INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAYAnd we're back to the interrogation. Dunbar, stubbing out a
cigarette and looking up at Hardy and Osborne.DUNBARCan I have some coffee?
Osborne blinks, like a trance has been broken.OSBORNEYeah... yeah, sure.
She goes over to the machine and pours a cup.HARDYYou shot Childs and Nunez.DUNBARThey would have killed us both. You
           want me to write a confession, I'll
           write a confession.HARDYYou saved Kendall's life-DUNBARBut not Pike's.
Osborne hands him the coffee.OSBORNEWhy didn't you tell us all this in
           the first place?66.DUNBARWould you have believed me?
Their faces say "no".   Osborne spreads a MAP out on the table.OSBORNEWhere's the cabin?DUNBARDon't know on a map. West told us
          it was there, we just found it.
          Maybe the hurricane took it away.HARDYRaymond, for you to have any chance
          of coming out of this, we need to
          locate the other bodies and examine
          them to corroborate your testimony.
          Otherwise this is just another story-DUNBARMr. Hardy, I joined the army for
          college money. I didn't ask for any
          of this - I tried to do the right
          thing out there and people got killed.
          You say finding those bodies'll help
          me, then go find them. I don't want
          to die.EXT. FOR MCKINLEY -- CORRIDORS -- DAYHardy and Osborne, walking and talking.OSBORNETalk it through: Childs, Mueller,
          and Nunez know they're going out on
          the regular Tuesday Night drill,
          hurricane or ho hurricane, so they
          plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.HARDYAnd they're smart about it. They
          know when you commit a crime you
          know is going to be investigated,
          you need a fall guy and for that to
          work, you have to have a witness.OSBORNEDunbar.HARDYExactly, someone who's not involved,
          who's word can't be questioned. You
          only let them see what you want them
          to see, you make them believe, so
          when the time comes, they've totally
          bought into your version of events.67.OSBORNEThey believe the innocent are guilty
          and the guilty are innocent.HARDYAnd if they're asked, that's what
          they'll tell the, world.OSBORNESo it's a good plan but it goes wrong;
          Mueller flips out and shoots their
          fall guy, which means they have to
          bring Dunbar and Kendall into the
          Cover story-HARDYKendall maybe would have agreed, but
          The hurricane buttfucks the cabin-OSBORNEButtfucks the cabin?HARDYAnd all hell breaks loose. A lot of
          Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys
          and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.OSBORNESo why, after Dunbar drags Kendall
          out from under a house, does the
          Senator's son try and get us to put
          his savior in the gas chamber?HARDYThat bugs you too?OSBORNELittle bit.HARDYLet's go talk to Bill...INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- DAYHardy and Osborne stand in front of an agitated Styles. He
tries to take a hit off his asthma inhaler and gets nothing.
Frustrated, he tosses it away.STYLESFucking asthma... This whole thing's
          driving it nuts.
A beat.HARDYWhat I said before-68.STYLESWas dead right. You think Dunbar's
          on the level?HARDYYeah.STYLESDoes Osborne agree?OSBORNEYes, sir, I do.
Hardy lays a piece of paper on Styles' desk.HARDYDunbar's confession. It should be
          enough to get you out of trouble.
Styles looks at it and then slowly up to Hardy.STYLESYou want Kendall, don't you?OSBORNEHe tried to burn Dunbar to us. You
          don't do that if you're not involved.
Hardy nods, agreeing.   Styles stares at them.STYLESYou both know if you do this, if you
          go after a Senator's son and you're
          wrong... it's not just me in the hot
          seat anymore.OSBORNEWe know.STYLES(to Hardy)
          I'm giving you a chance to walk away.HARDYWe know.
Styles nods and looks to his desk.      Almost to himself:STYLESYou don't get to be a Colonel without
          compromising. Without getting out
          of the way of the bigger dogs. You
          politic, play it safe, think of the
          career first. And when things get
          dirty, you just look the other way...
He looks back up at Hardy.      His eyes, steeled.69.STYLESFour of my men are dead. You think
          Kendall had something to do with it,
          then you go get the son of a bitch.INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAYKendall lies in his bed, looking worse than before.   Hardy
and Osborne enter.OSBORNEPike never confessed.KENDALLWe've been making progress, I see.

Osborne looks to her watch.   Kendall notices.KENDALLRunning out of time, are we? Tick-
          Tock, tick-tock, how long till your
          witnesses fly the coop?OSBORNEFifty minutes.KENDALLNot much time to solve the crime.
          Tell me, detective, how did it feel
          taking blood money from Guissepe
          Torres? Did it weigh on your
          conscience or did you just not think
          about it?HARDYYou tried to pin three stone murders
          on Dunbar-KENDALLHow many murders did you cover up?
          One? Five? Maybe an even ten.HARDY(to Osborne)
          Can I go to jail for punching a guy
          who's been shot?

Kendall begins coughing.KENDALLI think they're giving me the wrong
          medicine. This isn't a very good
          Hospital, you know-

Hardy sighs and goes to the sink to get him some water.70.KENDALLEpileptic attacks are murder on your
          system. Rattle your internal organs
          like a paint mixer.HARDYMy heart weeps.
He returns with a GLASS OF WATER and hands it to Kendall.OSBORNEPike never confessed.KENDALLNo, but it got you interested, didn't
          it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray
          to tell you terribly sordid tales
          about drugs and creek beds and dead
          little sergeants who stuck their
          noses where they didn't belong.HARDYIs it the truth?KENDALLThere's that word again.
              (smiling)
          As I told you, I wasn't in the room
          when everyone started shooting.OSBORNEDunbar says you were.KENDALLThen he's mistaken. You know, I
          really don't think my father would
          approve of this line of questioning-HARDYWhy did you tell us he shot everybody,
          Levi? You put him in for three
          murders, the man saved your life-KENDALLSo I should stay silent about his
          misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran
          in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller
          were dead, and Dunbar was running
          out the door with the smoking gun-HARDYDunbar was running out the door?
          Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was
          confused, because I thought you said
          Nunez was running out the door.71.KENDALLNo.   I said Dunbar.HARDYHuh. You know, I really thought you
          said Nunez. I thought you said
          "Dunbar was gone," My fault, I gotta
          check the tape on that.
              (off Kendall's look)
          Oh, yeah we taped the last interview.
          This one too. Cause it'd be a real
          break for us to catch you in a lie.
Silence. They wait for Kendall's reaction. He looks
momentarily flustered by this... and then he smiles.KENDALLI believe your next line is "What
          are you trying to hide?"HARDYWell?KENDALLSorry to disappoint. I'm on
          painkillers for the injury - they
          cloud the mind. You're right, it
          was Nunez. Any more questions?
Hardy doesn't know what to say.   That was his ace card.KENDALLDon't get me wrong, Mueller and Childs
          were quite the pair, the type of
          guys you didn't feel comfortable
          going to sleep around. Completely
          capable of murder. But as I said, I
          didn't hear the exchange before the

Osborne furrows her brow at this as Hardy continues.HARDYDunbar will testify that you were.KENDALLThen we'll leave it up to the courts -

          Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice
          will be served. In any case, my

             guys you don't feel comfortable going
             to sleep around." That's what Dunbar
             said about Childs to the letter.HARDYAre you sure?OSBORNEPositive.    Hardy, they planned this.
She grins.    He grins back.OSBORNENot bad for hostile and uncooperative,
             eh?INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAYHardy and Osborne reenter, smiling.      Kendall chuckles.HARDYSomething funny, Levi?KENDALLI was just thinking of what's going
             to happen to your careers when my
             father gets through with you.
Hardy pulls the out MICRORECORDER and hands it to Osborne.HARDYWhy don't you talk to Levi off the
             record for a second?OSBORNEGood idea.73.Smiling, she stops the tape.    Then turns to Kendall.OSBORNEYou and Dunbar got your stories
          straight. Little details, little
          inconsistencies, designed to bounce
          us back from one of you to the other,
          asking questions, killing time, until
          the transport arrives and whisks you
          away to where Senator Daddy can
          protect you. You think you're just
          going to slide out of this? You're
          an accessory to murder, Levi, you're
          Going to jail-KENDALLYou can't threaten me-HARDYJail if he's lucky, the gas chamber
          if he's not-KENDALLDidn't do anything-

Osborne laughs.OSBORNEIt doesn't matter, Levi. We're going
          to find those bodies and when we do,
          I'm going to make sure one of them
          has a bullet in them that matches
          your weapon-KENDALLWhat?HARDYThat's a fantastic idea-OSBORNESee, I just take your gun to the
          morgue and fire it into one of their
          skulls; then I call every newspaper
          in the country with the story about
          how Senator Kendall's gay son went
          nuts on a training mission-KENDALL(beginning to panic)
          It won't work-OSBORNEIt will and you know why?(MORE)74.OSBORNEBecause you're not a person anymore,
           you're a cadet in the United States
           Army; you have no identity, no Miranda

           throw you to the wolves, and unlike
           you I'm gonna get away with it,
           because you're pissing me off!

trying to suppress a smile. Osborne rises for the door.OSBORNEEnjoy your flight to Washington-KENDALLWait-OSBORNEWhat.
Silence.   Kendall takes a deep breath.KENDALLDunbar's telling the truth.OSBORNEWrong answer-KENDALLWe did get our stories straight, but
           not because we killed anyone.

Kendall stares at the recorder.   A long pause.OSBORNEWho, Levi-KENDALLChilds.75.HARDYHow do you know?KENDALLBecause I was standing next to him.
He pauses, taking a shaky sip of water.KENDALLI was in on the PX thing. He and
          Mueller and me, we were making
          thousands. West found out. Childs
          said we were just gonna scare him -
          Use my Dad's clout. I had this whole
          speech prepared about how if he ratted

          I'd end up the same as West.
Pan over to Dunbar, who binds his friend, sadly.KENDALL (V.O.)Dunbar didn't know anything about
          any of it. Everything he told you
          was true, except after...76.EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- LAST NIGHTDunbar pulls Kendall from the cabin's wreckage. As Kendall
begins to talk to him, Dunbar's eyes widen in shock. ..KENDALL (V.O.)I told him what had really happened
          to West. Told him to keep quiet
          about it or I'd destroy him. Because
          if it came out that I was involved
          with the whole PX scam, my father
          would be finished.INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAYKENDALLI scared Dunbar into silence.  He's

          me... I didn't know if I could trust
          him with that kind of secret-OSBORNESo you framed him. The same way
          Childs was going to frame Pike.
Kendall nods.   Crying a little.HARDYLittle advice, Levi, next time you
          frame a guy, pick someone who can't
          defend themselves.
Kendall says nothing.OSBORNEWhat happened with Nunez?KENDALLHe came after us. And I told Dunbar

Hardy smiles and gets up.   Walking slowly to Kendall's bed.HARDYChilds did it, huh?
Kendall nods, still a little teary.HARDYFirst Pike, then Mueller, now Childs?
          When are we getting to the others?
          When are we gonna hear about Nunez?
FLASHCUT TO - NUNEZ, in the creek bed, SHOOTING WEST.HARDYOr Dunbar?

          prove anything until we find the

Kendall, crying harder now, beginning to shake.HARDYYou lied to us, Levi, you're going

          us where to find them!KENDALLI don't know-HARDYWhere are they!KENDALLMaybe-HARDYMAYBE WHAT-78.KENDALLMAYBE HE-And then. His mouth SLAMS SHUT. Teeth cracking together
over and over again like a metronome on speed, and his body
JERKS HORRIBLY, going horizontal, SHAKING VIOLENTLY!

Osborne, leaping to her feet.OSBORNEGet something between his teeth!

Hardy grabs a fork from the bedside table and tries to shove
it into Kendall's chattering mouth. His teeth, CLAMPING
DOWN on the metal and Hardy's hand, drawing blood.HARDYShit!

The Nurse bursts into the room.NURSEWhat is-OSBORNEHe's an epileptic!

The Nurse runs to the bed, pushing Hardy aside. As more

and Osborne from the room.INT. BASE HOSPITAL -- WAITING ROOM -- DAYLater.   Hardy and Osborne sit in silence, eyes downcast.
Waiting. Hardy pulls his last cigarette from the pack, lights
it, crumples the pack and tosses it into a garbage can.HARDYI pushed him too hard.OSBORNEYou couldn't have known-HARDYYeah, I could've.      Should've.OSBORNEYou wanted to get the truth.HARDYNo, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate
           him. For what he did to Dunbar.
           For fucking over the little guy.OSBORNEYou mean the falsely accused?
Hardy looks up at her and nods.OSBORNEYou wanted to break him.HARDYYeah.OSBORNESo did I.
She looks back to the floor. Hardy takes a drag from the
cigarette, and then tosses that away too.
The door opens and Styles walks into the room.    Somber.STYLESIt's over.   Time of death was 4:42.(MORE)80.STYLES (CONT'D)JAG's been notified and I called the

          no culpability in the matter.HARDYThat's horseshit and you know it.STYLESMaybe. But it's my fault and I'll
          carry it.

          to me?HARDYI wouldn't know where to start.
              (pause)
          I guess it was about one man framing
          another. He thought if the other

Styles nods, understanding.OSBORNEWhat happens to Dunbar now?STYLESGets on his plane in ten minutes,
          which means you two are done.

They pass a GROUP OF CADETS doing drills.    Hardy, watching
them. Almost looking wistful.OSBORNEYou know, you never told me why you
          left the army.HARDYIt dawned on me one day that we were
          supposed to be a nation founded on

dead at his feet.HARDY (V.O.)But that wasn't enough. You needed

          convicted felon, had acted so nobly
          in the face of danger - you needed a
          name people could trust, one that
          hadn't been to jail, one that hadn't
          publicly been West's bitch boy.

He stares down at the bodies in the cabin, his eyes focusing
on the black man's uniform. The name on it reads - "DUNBAR".

As he reaches for it...86.INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT EVENINGOSBORNEYou kept Kendall alive to corroborate
          your story and he did it all they
          way up to the end. You even gave
          him his own motive in case we decided
          to burn him, too.DUNBARCan't do that now, though, can you?HARDYYou walked into the army a convicted
          felon with a sentence of five years

          eight weeks later with a different
          name, a clean record, and an honorable
          discharge - a guy who did "everything
          he could" to save his friends.
Dunbar looks at them.   One to the other.   Slowly.DUNBARIs that what I did, now? And of
          course, you can prove all of it.OSBORNEWe can prove that you're not Ray
          Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet
          is a court-martial in and of itself-DUNBARDid I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar?
          Was I ever told to state my name
          rank and serial number for the record?
          No. You assumed who I was, because
          I was wearing this uniform. Don't
          believe me?
He reaches under the table and rips out the HIDDEN MICROPHONE.DUNBARCheck your tapes.
Hardy and Osborne exchange an uneasy glance.HARDYWe don't need the tapes-DUNBAROh, you don't? What else do you
          have on me? You haven't found any
          bodies yet, have you?HARDYWe've found all of them.87.Dunbar chuckles at the bluff.DUNBAROhhhh, I don't think so...OSBORNEHow do you know that?DUNBARJust a guess. Maybe they're not
          where they're supposed to be. Maybe
          somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus -
          no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still
          plays as self defense. Face it
          detectives ... you have nothing.

Hardy, knowing he's right. In a flash he reaches down PULLS
OSBORNE'S GUN and grabs Dunbar, SLAMMING him up against the

          to his cabin. And then he told us.INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHTThe six men stand in rigid formation, eyes on West.WESTGentlemen! It has come to my
          attention that there is a traitor in
          our midst. Someone who was going to
          break the code of fraternal
          brotherhood that I have endeavored
          to create in all of you. Perhaps
          that failure is mine. But we take
          care of our own. And this traitor
          must be made to pay.
He walks down the line of the six men, eyeing each of them.
Finally stopping at one. Putting a hand on his shoulder.91.Nunez.WESTRun.NUNEZSir, I wasn't-WESTI know you were. Cadet  Mueller found
             the letter you'd written to the
             Colonel in your locker.  You were
             going to betray us all.  Now, run.
He points to the door. The hurricane, RAGING outside.   Nunez
looks to the others, then the door, and understands.
He takes off running out the door.       Gone.
West walks over to a table covered with a tarp. Pulls the
cloth aside to reveal M-16's, PISTOLS, and GRENADES.WESTNow we'll see whose training's paid
             off the most. You are to hunt Cadet
             Nunez down and bring his body back
             to me. If you fail and he escapes,
             we all go down together.
The remaining five cadets, understanding there is no place
for friendship or kindness here. This is life and death.
They walk to the table and gear up.EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- LAST NIGHTLightning, thunder, and rain as Nunez runs unarmed through
the thick brush.
SOMEWHERE BEHIND HIM - The other five fan out, rifles up,

             man down to kill him.ON MUELLERMaking his way down embankment, M-l6 out, ready for anything.
From behind him, MOVEMENT...DUNBAR (V.O.)He got Mueller first.
Nunez TACKLES HIM at full speed, feet SLIPPING on the wet
hill, and the two TUMBLE head first into a GULLY. Punching,
kicking, biting, anything to stop the other man.92.Nunez, CHOKING Mueller as he strains to reach his gun...MUELLERRoberto...
With a HEAVE, Nunez SNAPS HIS NECK.        Mueller lies still.DUNBAR (V.O.)He took his gun. Used it on Childs.
Nunez spins, seeing CHILDS BEHIND HIM. He DIVES as Childs
fires! Hits the ground in a roll, comes up with Mueller's
rifle, and SHOOTS - BLOWING CHILDS BACK against the wet rocks.DUNBAR (V.O.)I can't imagine what it was like.
            Having your friends try to kill you...
Nunez slumps against the gully's wall, breathing hard.          In
agony over what he's just had to do.DUNBAR (V.O.)But you do what you have to survive.
Closing his eyes, Nunez steels himself. Wipes the blood
from his hands and climbs out of the gully.ELSEWHEREPIKE, creeping through the foliage. Trying to listen for
sounds of movement through the storm. His eyes narrow as he
hears a HIGH PITCHED WHINE...
The bullet hits his forehead dead center.        He crumples.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL - Nunez in a tree, thirty meters away.
Lowering his rifle.      He climbs down.DUNBAR (V.O.)Kendall and I found Dunbar a couple
            minutes later.TIME CUT TO:Dunbar and Kendall come upon Pike's fallen form. They gaze
down at the uniform emblazoned with the name "DUNBAR".DUNBAR (V.O.)It came to me in a split second.

            If James Pike gets discharged he
            goes right back to jail. But if I
            was Dunbar, I could walk away from
            all this with a new life. But then...
As he reaches down for the uniform, a SHOT RINGS OUT.93.KENDALL FALLS, wounded in the arm. Dunbar raises his rifle
to find Nunez, standing ten yards away, gun trained on him.YELLING OVER THE HURRICANE:NUNEZPut it down!
A Mexican stand-off.   The rain continues to fall.DUNBARI just want to go!
Nunez shakes his head.NUNEZYou were gonna kill me, Pike!    Thought
           you were my friend!
Dunbar, torn. He can't bring himself to shoot, but he can't
surrender either.DUNBARI have to get Kendall to a hospital!NUNEZHe was gonna kill me too!
Silence.   The two men still facing each other.NUNEZ {CONT'D)I snapped Mueller's neck! He was my
           best friend and I had to snap his
           neck because he was gonna shoot me
           for drugs! For West!DUNBARWe don't have to do this! You go
           that way, I'll go this way!
Nunez laughs.NUNEZYou'll shoot me in the back!DUNBARYou killed three people!    Isn't that
           enough for one night?
More silence.   Neither moves.    The sky above, a maelstrom.DUNBARI don't want to die out here, Roberto!
           Do you?
Nunez, staring at him.     Deciding.94.NUNEZIf you even twitch...
Dunbar nods.
Nunez begins backing away, rifle still trained on him.
And then Dunbar spies something behind and to the left of
Nunez...
West.
Staring down at him from behind some brush.       Watching.
Nunez, slowly backing away. He pauses as his foot catches
on a fallen branch. Looks away from Dunbar for a split second
to step over it...
West nods to Dunbar as if to say "Go on. . . "DUNBARForgive me. ..
And Dunbar FIRES.
Nunez, caught by the burst, GOES DOWN. The echo of the
gunshots, swallowed by the storm. Dunbar lowers his head in
agony. West walks down.WESTCongratulations, Cadet Pike.      You
          get the gold star.
Dunbar stares at his Sergeant through the rain.DUN BARFuck you.
West smiles.   Tilts his head to Kendall.WESTYou'd best get him out of here.
          Don't worry about the bodies, they'll
          be taken care of.
Dunbar doesn't move.WESTThis is where we part ways, Cadet.
          You tell them I died out here, or
          I'll come back for you. Tell them
          one of the others did me. Mueller,
          Childs, I don't care who. You and
          Kendall, you tell them a story.

          You can tell a story, can't you?
Dunbar doesn't reply.   West laughs and flips him a salute.95.WESTDismissed.

And West turns and walks away, stepping over Nunez.   Giving
Dunbar a clear shot at his back.

Dunbar raises his rifle, wanting, needing, dying to shoot
the old man...

But he can't.   West disappears into the bayou.

A GROAN from the ground. Kendall. Dunbar's reverie broken,
he leans down, beginning to unbutton the Dunbar Uniform...INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT EVENINGDunbar stubs out a cigarette, finished. Hardy, Osborne,
Styles, and the JAG Lawyer gaping at what he has just said.DUNBARI guess Nunez wasn't dead after all.
          He came after us with a vengeance.
              (to Styles)
          You know the rest.HARDYAnd the bodies?DUNBARYou won't find them. Won't find
          West, either. He's too good.OSBORNENo bodies, no West...HARDYNo death certificates.    No crime.DUNBARJust four people MIA.    Silence.

The JAG Lawyer steps forward.JAG LAWYERYou'll testify to this, the
          corruption, the drug scam?

Dunbar says nothing.JAG LAWYERWe can cut a deal for you on the
          Nunez killing.DUNBARI don't want any deals.96.JAG LAWYERIf you're telling the truth, the PX
           requisition records will prove it-DUNBARAll the proof you need will be when
           West comes back and puts a bullet in
           my brain. But I'll do it. I'm a
           dead man, anyway. Like Kendall.
               (looking at Hardy)
           We both should have died out there
           with our brothers. I know that now.
Silence.   The JAG Lawyer looks to Hardy, all anger gone.JAG LAWYERI'll take him now if you don't mind.
Hardy nods. Dunbar rises and slowly walks to the door.
Turning back to Hardy.DUNBARTell me, detective.   Did you get
           what you wanted?
Hardy shakes his head, sadly.HARDYNot even close.
They leave.   Styles walks over to Hardy.STYLESTom-
Hardy holds up a hand, cutting him off. Styles nods,
understanding, and leaves, closing the door behind him.
Hardy and Osborne stand there.   Not speaking.    It's done.INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- OFFICER'S CLUB -- NIGHTSeveral hours and bourbons later, Hardy sits at the bar,
drunk and alone. Out of place, the only one not in uniform.
Osborne walks in, locates Hardy, and strides over to the
bar, a sheaf of papers under her arm. Her face, stoic.OSBORNEWe need to talk-HARDYSeven.
He takes a slug of his drink.OSBORNEWhat?97.HARDYSeven guys. What was it you said?
          You were "just starting to believe I
          wasn't the guy people said".
He chuckles.HARDY {CONT'D)Seven. That's the answer to Kendall's
          question. How many? Seven.
Osborne looks at him.    Realizing what he's saying.OSBORNEThis isn't the time-HARDYThis is the perfect time. You know
          what makes a good detective? The
          number of confessions they get.
          You're a good detective, Osborne.
          So now you get mine.OSBORNEWhat if I don't want it?HARDYTough.
He pours himself another drink.HARDYThing about    taking money is, you
          don't have    to do anything.  You just
          sit there.     Maybe you don't return a
          phone call.     Maybe you don't follow
          up a lead.     But that's it.  Keep the
          money, your    work's done.
Osborne stares at him.HARDYSeven unsolved murders. And you
          know what? It didn't weigh on my
          conscience. Not one goddamn bit.
He takes a slug from his glass and grimaces.OSBORNEThat's not true.HARDYThere are degrees of truth, officer.
          Always degrees.98.OSBORNEYou're a good man, Hardy.HARDYReally.OSBORNEFar as I'm concerned, whatever you
          did in the past can stay in the past.
Hardy stares at her.HARDYI may not be growing on you, but
          you're sure as hell growing on me.
He motions to the bartender for another glass, but Osborne
takes his hand, stopping him.OSBORNEAnd because you're a good man, I
          know you'll do the right thing.
Hardy looks at her, questioning.   Osborne takes a deep breath.OSBORNEPike never made it to D.C.. Somebody
          took him off the plane before it
          left. My guess is he's already dead.
Hardy stares at her.HARDYWest?OSBORNENobody saw.    But I don't think so.
She puts the papers on the bar.OSBORNEThese are the requisitions from the
          PX, the ones used to release the
          drugs to Mueller. West signed half
          of them - Pike was telling the truth.
          Look who signed the other half.
She taps the bottom of the paper. Hardy, not wanting to
believe it. He looks up at her, pained.HARDYDo I have a choice in this?OSBORNEYeah. I can wait till you're off
          the base and do it myself.99.Hardy stares at his glass.   Deciding.HARDYFuck it.   Let's go finish this.INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- NIGHTStyles, finishing his paperwork. He rises and turns off his
desk light, bathing the office in DARKNESS. He's about to
leave when he notices a SILHOUETTE in the doorway.HARDY"You have to get out of the way of
          the bigger dogs". That was good.
Styles squints at the figure.STYLESTom, is that you?
Hardy steps forward, into the office.HARDYIt was so good, I actually forgot
          you're one of the bigger dogs now.
          The Base Commander. The one in
          control.
You couldn't let him testify, could you?STYLESWhat are you talking about?HARDYIf you let him testify then it would
          have all come out. West was supposed
          to take care of it out there, shut
          Nunez up and then disappear. But it
          got messy and people got killed. So
          you called your old pal Tom Hardy,
          figuring if worse came to worse,
          he'd cover for you.STYLESYou're drunk-HARDYI'm not going to cover for you, Bill.
          Not for this.
Styles, realizing what Hardy's talking about.STYLESLook-
He begins to move from behind his desk.100.HARDYStay where you are.STYLESOr what?   You've gone round the bend-HARDYWest had a partner. Someone who
          knew how to get things done.

Hardy throws the papers onto Styles' desk.HARDYWhat I can't understand is why you
          signed these. If you'd just let
          West take care of the paperwork, no
          one would have known, but you got
          careless. So when Pike finally told
          the truth you had to get rid of him,
          too.STYLESThat's preposterous-HARDYToxicology report came back.
          Kendall's attack was caused by a
          drug known as anephadrine, maybe
          you've heard of it. It's for
          asthmatics. If an epileptic takes
          enough, it kills them. I checked
          with the nurses at the hospital -
          you're the only other person who
          visited Kendall.STYLESWanted to see if he was okay-HARDYYou poisoned him, Bill. You heard
          our interrogation, you knew he was
          ready to crack, so you killed him,
          just like Pike.STYLESI'm not even going to dignify that-HARDYNo!  You will stand there and you
          will listen! What happened to you,
          Bill?  You were the one who joined
          up to do good in the world. You
          were the one who believed in it-101.STYLESYou want to get into a finger pointing
          contest about character? The army
          kicked you out for drugs, the cops
          fired you for taking bribes from a
          mobster, and you think you can stand
          there and lecture me on codes of
          conduct? There's only one criminal
          standing in this room and it's you.HARDYNot for long.
He walks towards the desk.HARDYNo more witnesses. West's a ghost.
          But it doesn't matter because we
          have your signature, the hospital
          log, and Kendall's toxicology report.
          And that'll be enough.STYLESYou're crazy-HARDYYou can't duck this, Bill. I may
          have done every goddamn thing in my
          life wrong but I won't let this
          happen.STYLESFor the last time, I have no idea
          what you're talking about-HARDY(squinting)
          Get your hands away from the desk!
In the darkness we see Styles MOVE SUDDENLY...HARDYOsborne, gun!
Hardy DIVES to the floor - Osborne in the doorway, PISTOL
raised, FIRES TWO SHOTS! Muzzle flare lighting the room for
a split second as Styles is BLOWN BACK against the wall!
Hardy gets to his feet and flicks on the LIGHT. Styles lies
slumped in the corner, two holes in his chest. Dead.
Osborne lowers her weapon, shaking.
Hardy points to the top desk drawer, which is open. Inside
it sits an IVORY HANDLED PISTOL. Fully loaded, safety off.
It's presence tells them everything they need to know.102.OSBORNEIt's West's, isn't it?
Hardy nods and then turns to look down at Styles' body.HARDYNow it's over.EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- PARADE GROUNDS -- NIGHTThe aftermath. Flashing blue and red lights from parked
Military Police vehicles illuminate the grounds as M.P. 'S
string crime scene tape around the front entrance of the
building, securing the site for investigation.
Hardy takes in the entire scene from afar. Standing by his
GTO, watching as several M.P.'s finish questioning Osborne.
When she's done she spies Hardy and walks over to him.OSBORNEWhat are you doing out here?HARDYLeaving without saying goodbye.
          What are you gonna do?OSBORNEGo home, get drunk, and try and forget
          this ever happened.HARDYThink it'll work?OSBORNENah.HARDYWant company?
Osborne smiles.OSBORNEA word of advice about women - that
          first hour or so after they kill
          their boss? Probably not the best
          time to hit on them.HARDYI should probably write that down.OSBORNEYeah. .
Hardy pulls a card from his pocket and hands it to her.OSBORNEYour phone number?103.HARDYIn case you need me to testify about
            the shooting. They'll clear you.
A beat.OSBORNEHe was your friend.HARDYYeah. But he was a lot of other
            things, too. Thanks.
She nods.   An awkward moment.      Finally:HARDYI'll see you.
He turns away.   Walking towards his car.OSBORNEHey, Hardy!
He turns back. She walks up and holds something out to him.
A ten dollar bill.OSBORNEI owe you this.
He looks down at the money.HARDYYou saved my life tonight. Keep it.
                (pause)
            Actually, don't keep it, I need the
            money.
He takes the bill and Osborne laughs. He climbs into his
car and starts it. Grinning at her through the open window.HARDYYou're one of the good ones, Osborne.
            Don't sweat the details.
He puts the GTO in gear and drives off. She watches him go,
then looks down at his card. Smiling. Maybe she will call.INT. OSBORNE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHTA bottle of Scotch at her side, Osborne slips a tape marked

at what he sees. Nunez stands unarmed in the creek bed,
SURROUNDED by the other Section Eight Cadets. A prisoner.WESTWhat the fuck is going on?DUNBARYour weapons, Sergeant.
