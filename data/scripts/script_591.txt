                            Rob Festinger & Todd FieldFADE IN:THE SOUND OF WIND AND NOTHING ELSEEXT. GI'S POINTWe are in the midst of a field of tall grass wild flowers.
          A long rutted road stretches into the distance. Faintly at
          first and then closer - we hear a woman squealing with
          laughter. We see her legs cut through the grass and fly up a
          hill. Close on her heels is a young man, a good ten years
          younger, in hot pursuit.
          Over the field - across the tops of blades, sits an ancient
          apple tree. We rise out of the grass and see the two young
          people under the tree. They are entwined - in a deep embrace.CLOSER NOWWe see them in glimpses:
          Their eyes - Lips - Hands
          Finally they part - the woman rests her head on his chest.
          She reaches out and strokes his hand.
          He stares at their fingers mingling together.
          The woman sighs.WOMANI Love it here.
          I know you do...WOMANI can feel my life - ya know.
          He stares up into the boughs above him and sHd.les.

          THE SOUND OF BALLGAmE OVER:T. RURAL ROUTE 90 - PREDAWNA BLUE 1973 CHEW PICK-UP winds around a corner and
          disappears down a long stretch of road. "And that's it from
          Fenway the final score Oakland 3 t1 Redsox 7. You have been
          listening to the re-broadcast of last night's game. This
          broadcast is the sole property of -- -)r League Baseball and

          old clapboard two-story affairs.2EXT. NATALIE'S HOUSE - SStanding. on the lawn in front of one of them is the woman from
          the opening scene, NATALIE STRUT, prett - eautifl actually
          with a little more sleep. She stands wit two small boys who
          are doing their best to stay warm in the morning air. Her son
          JASON 8 , and his brother DUNCAN 4, who has his face buried in
          his mother's coat--refusing to see or be seen.
          The truck comes to a stop and two men get out. One is young,
          early 20's, and even at this hour his step is lively, his
          face full of warmth. He walks over to Natalie and gives her a
          kiss. The young man from the opening scene, rRANK FOWLER.
          The other man leans back against the passenger door. He is
          in his early 50's. Kind face, good looking, athletic in his
          day - Frank's father, MATT. He smiles at Natalie.
          Natalie smiles back.NATALIEMorn'in Dr. Fowler.MATTMorn'in Natalie. How you doing boys?JASONGreat!
          Jason starts for the truck. Matt opens the door and the boy
          climbs inside the cab.
          Frank kneels down to Duncan.FHey buddy ... you upset that you're not
          coming?
          Frank reaches out and puts his hand on the boys shoulder.
          Duncan pulls away.
          Frank looks up to Natalie for help.FHe can come if he wants ...we can manage,
          really.
          She smiles and shakes her head.NATALIEahead. He wants to stay here.FDon't worry Dunk. You can come next time.

          Natalie kisses him and they're off.INTO TRUCK - SAME - MOVINGJason in the middle. He glances over to Frank - a trace of
          hero :worship in his face.I NT. STROUT & SONS CANNERY - DAWNSardines are processed at lightening speed. We follow them on their
          journey, which ends with the sealed cans being packed into
          cardboard shipping boxes. They are taped shut by a young man we
          will meet later (TIM, 3 ) . The tops read STROUT & SONS.I NT. ATKINS LOBSTER CO-OP - DAWNA double-55-gallon-drum wood stove is humping. Several men turn their
          bodies rotisserie-fashion around the thing, while making morning
          small talk - The starting price of lobsters, the prospect of repairs
          to their equipment, and so on.
          A SCARRED HAND scribbles some figures on a wall that has been
          used as a scratch pad for years.
          Two scales are emptied of RED FISH into a PLASTIC PICKLE BUCKET.EXT. HARBOR - SAMEA pair of CANVAS TENNIS SHOES shuffle down a gangway. The
          bucket sways directly over them. A small hand struggles with
          the weight of the thing. A pair of BEACON FALLS waders appear
          - the shoes stop. A strong hand grabs hold of the handle -
          the shoes pick up the pace.EXT. HARBOR - SMatt & Frank prepare the rig.
          Jason stands on the dock, taking it all in. A field of
          LOBSTER POTS stacked like cordwood and surrounded by a
          collection of SCARRED BUOYS, GRAPNEL and coiled FISHING GEAR
          stiff with sea salt - all so wildly unreasonable as to seem
          exotic.
          Jason's eyes find the hull of "GIGI" an old Boudreau built
          lobsterboat. Starboard side covered in barnacles.FC'mon up Jace.MATTHold on a second. Need to know if he's
          ready first - Jason, can you tell me
          what's important?
          Jason hesitates.Fon tell hï¿½JASON(NERVOUS)"A shaft of sunlight at the end of a dark
          afternoon, a note in music--LHe takes a breath.JASONand the way the back of a baby's neck
          smells if its mother keeps it tidy."MATT(TO FRANK)You taught h' well.
          Jason beams.MATT- come aboard sailor.
          Matt reaches down to give a hand up.
          Frank turns the engine over. It roars to life.EXT. HARBOR LATERThe sun is fast climbing into the morning sky as "GIGI"
          glides out of the channel and past a LIGHTHOUSE that sits
          Just off the point of a good sized ISLAND.
          Jason shields his eyes with his hand. He gazes out at the
          island. Matt comes up beside him and sticks a baseball cap
          onto his head. The crown reads U.S.S. CONSTELLATION.JASONThank you.MATTEver been over there?JASONNo sir.MATTIt's beautiful. Isn't an island anymore
          though. It's a city. They have electric
          lights. Artesian wells, even a jail
          lighthouse isn't manned anymore - it's
          run by a computer When I lived there,
          had no ferry then` so we didn't even have
          cars, can you believe that?JASONHow'd you get back?MATTOff the island?
          Jason nods.
          We rowed.
          Matt smiles at the memory.5MATTThen we got a little outboard. That was
          great. A seven and a half horsepower it
          was - we lived there until I was about
          your age - then we left and became
          "harbor people".
          Jason seems to be digesting this.JASONI a "harbor person"?
          Matt hides a smile about to form.MATTYep, Jason - we all are.
          Jason is full of questions. Matt knows the answers and
          doesn't talk down to him. Something the boy is grateful for.FAt the helm. His eye s inted from glare and cold. He cuts
          back on the throttle s and heads for the winch.
          GLOVED HANDS pull up a BLUE-GREEN BUOY and slide the MANILA
          LINE into the WINCH.
          A POT surfaces and Frank sets it "Doors up" on the edge. He
          opens the doors. His hands work quickly and efficiently. He
          tosses a SMALL CRAB back into the water, pulls out a LOBSTER
          and measures the back. Too small. Then a nice sized LOBSTER
          is pulled out - it's missing the SCISSOR CLAW. He hands it to
          Matt. Baits the trap. Throws the winch and the next pot
          surfaces.
          Matt sits inside, Jason on his lap. He reaches into a WOODEN
          BOX of RUBBER BANDS with a BANDING WRENCH and bands the
          crustacean's remaining CRUNCHER CLAW.
          Jason stares at the disfigured creature.MATTOh boy you see what happened to
          this poor fel ow?JASON.what?MATTWell, the trap has nylon nets called
          heads--2 side heads at b ends, so the
          lobster can crawl in. The "Bedroom" head
          inside, holds the bait and keeps it from
          escaping--you know the old saying "two's
          company three-s a crowd"?
          Jason nods.MATTWell{ it's like that. You get more than
          two in a bedroom and chances are
          something like this is going to happen.
          That's why Frank can't leave these traps
          for more than a day.
          Matt holds up another Lobster and turns it belly-up. There
          are black balls on both sides of the tail.MATTNow the older females like this of gal,
          are the most dan erous - especially when
          they're growin' eyries.JASONBerries?MATTEggs... .one of these can take out two
          males easy - Then you wind up with
          lobster you can't sell - and as for this
          fine lady, she gets off easy, the state
          says you have to let her go.
          Matt throws her back in the water. Holds up the other one to Jason.TTCan you handle this?
          Jason nods.MATT(GENTLY)You sure?
          He really isn't. Matt hands it to him.MATTGo ahead now, put it in the tank.
          Jason can't get the thing in the tank fast enough.EXT. FOWLER HOUSE - DAYLooking around, you see a big yard, double lot. The grass is
          manicured to per ection, someone takes a lot of pride in
          their garden. In the middle of this sits a two story cape,
          post Hopper/Wyeth, early 20th Century - simple, beautiful,
          d you on't freeze in the winter.
          The truck backs up into the driveway, Frank j s out, drops
          the gate. Resting on the bed is a LARGE BOX wit a line drawing
          of a SWING-SET.QFRANK O.S.Hey, dad can you give me a hand?
          The transistorized sounds of a baseball qame.EXT. FOWLER BACKYARD LATERFrank pushes Duncan, who sits proudly on his new swing-set.D CHigher! HIGHER!
          SMALL CHILDREN are everywhere. A serious Super Soaker Squirt
          Gun fight in progress.ACROSS THE YARDa steaming hot grill, with a huge assortment of hot-dogs &
          burgers. A spatula flips a patty.
          The sounds of Fenwav park emanate from a chea Dort able
          radio.
          WILLIS GRINNEL, early 50's, a stout, silver-haired man, works
          the grill. Standing next to him is Matt, his best friend for
          forty plus years.
          Matt takes a pull off a can of Moxie. Sets it down and searches
          through a plastic bread bag.
          Willis looks past him, distracted.MATTh, Ruth hates this kind.
          What?MATTI bought the wrong buns.WILLISMaybe we can borrow hers.
          Matt follows Willis's gaze, to the object of his distraction:
          A PRETTY WOMAN IN TIGHT DENIM SHORTS. She-s bent over to wipe
          the ketchup-stained face of Jason (he's wearing Matt's cap).WILLISAh, what I would give to have back my
          youth.MATTWillis, you never had that in your youth.
          The woman turns around and catches Willis staring. It's
          Natalia.
          Willis looks down, nonchalantly rifling through the bun bag.
          Matt waves to a passing man in khaki shorts, FATHER OBERTI,50-S-MATTFather! You made it!FATHER OBERTIHey, if I don't see you fellas here, I
          don't get to see you at all.ON FHe backwards-hugs Natalie.FYou want a beer?NATALIEI think I'll see if your Mom needs any
          help.FRANKGood luck.
          She laughs-He grabs and tickles her but she breaks away and
          escapes inside the house.
          Matt watches on, and falls into a wistful daydream.WILLISJealous?
          Matt turns to him and, to Willis's surprise, ever so slightly,
          nods.I NT. FOWLER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SNatalie walks in through the living room, pausing to examine
          a half finished ARCHITECTURAL MODEL that sits on a card-table
          next to a jigsaw puzzle.
          She looks toward the kitchen where a woman works at the sink.
          She takes a breath and starts there.I NT. FOWLER GARAGE - DAYOF THE GEFrank reaches into an old Westinghouse refrigerator. He pulls
          out a case of Schaeffer's and a six-pack of Moxie. He loads it
          all into a metal tub filled with ice.VOICE O.S.YO0Frank, hunched over as he works, loo. ip atFRONT OF THE GARAGETIM BRYSON, 22, still in his work clothes: He wears a White

          packer he ever had.
          Be nods.FHe always was a nice guy.TIM(EXHAUSTED)Are we there yet?
          Tim and Frank emerge from the side of the house. Willis cuts
          them off, grabs two beers.WILLISExcuse me boys - an offering. Catch
          Father.
          He throws one to Father Oberti who sits talking with Willis's wife

          vegetables on a plate. Natalie chops carrots on a cutting
          board.

          She does.RUTHThank you.NATALIEI'm looking forward to the concert on

          Jason playfully chases Duncan across the yard.
          Frank and Natalie stay behind, talking quietly.
          Matt takes a breath, and exhales. He turns to Ruth with a

          Drone"` a low monotone one hears underneath the other voices.

          water. There is my dear village and in
          that village, the prettiest girl.
          Without embarrassment, they shriek they drone, and at their
          ease they whistle. The music transports these girls - who are
          normally pre-occupied with images of MTV and Brad Pitt, to a
          place of pure self. The song ends.RUTHThat was really good! OK it's 7:30

          The bet's to Matt. He stares at his cards for a very long
          time. Willis looks to say something, when Henry hits his arm.
          This stops him.
          Matt looks up. He sees the patience they are all exercising
          for his typical indecisiveness. This bothers him.
          He stares back down at his cards. Stalling, waiting for
          someone to bust him.
          He looks u at Willis - Henry - Carl. They all sort of smile

          the center piece.

          The birds all seem to wake at once.
          Matt gazes up into the trees overhead, the first light just
          kissing their branches, the sky now a husky blue. The
          surrounding houses with the windows still dark, asleep.

          He doesn-t answer. He walks in and comes to bed, climbing in as
          Ruth moves over.RUTHAre you all right?
          He lies down. FACES THE WINDOW, AWAY FROM HER.
          She is on her side, she props herself up on her elbow -
          watching him.

          The bandage wet from washing up.

          His eyes full of an unspeakable sadness.
          The lids heavy. If only he could sleep.
          But he won't. Not today.
          There is a small crack in the ceiling.
