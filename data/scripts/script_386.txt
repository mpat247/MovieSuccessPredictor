              hatred.

              The new Protestant faith is
              spreading.

    Bodies burned on a pyre - men writhing under torture - a
    momentary half-recognisable face, gaunt and staring -FATHER ROBERT RESTON.CAPTIONThe most powerful ruler in
              Christendom, Philip of Spain, has
              sworn to return all Europe to the
              Catholic faith.

    Images of rival monarchs Philip and Elizabeth in court
    paintings: stiff, formal, imperious.CAPTIONOnly England stands in his way: a
              weak impoverished nation ruled by
              a woman.

    plain chapel, in virtual darkness. PHILIP II, King of Spain
    bows his head low, abasing himself before his God.TS/I CAPTION:scorial Palace, Spain, 1585.

    Now, slowly, he raises his head. His eyes open, and we see
    there the glow of a new certainty. God has spoken to him.PHILIP(I hear. I obey. My Lord and my1God.)May 1 Blue Draft--p.2INT. HALLWAY/SALON, ESCORIAL PALACE - DAY3                                                                 3Philip walks rapidly down a long corridor that opens out
    into a broader hallway, moving from the darkness of the
    chapel into ever brighter light and more visible glory. On
    his face the far shining gaze of a man who now knows his
    mission. Silent servants press themselves to the walls as
    he goes by. Through the hallway to a grand salon. COURTIERS
    fall silent and bow as he passes. So into the grandest
    salon of all, where his magnificent court is gathered;
    among them his 12-year-old daughter, the INFANTA. As he
    enters, all kneel.

    His eyes scan his ministers and courtiers, all kneeling,
    heads bowed before him. His gaze falls on one who wears the
    plain black robes of a Jesuit priest: Robert Reston, the
    face we glimpsed in the opening montage. He speaks to all.PHILIP(God has made his will known to
              me. The time for our great
              enterprise has come.)

    The Jesuit looks up and his eyes too show a powerful but
    disciplined satisfaction. He murmurs softly to himself.RESTONAt last.

    Cathedral bells ring out. The cheers of a crowd are heard
    through the open windows.

    The king passes out onto the salon's first-floor balcony.EXT. BALCONY, ESCORIAL PALACE - DAY4                                                                 4Hot sunlight. Philip stands gazing across the plaza at the
    great cathedral on the far side, as the bells ring out and
    the CROWD in the plaza below wave their hats and cheer. The
    Infanta is by his side. His MINISTERS cluster behind him.
    Lining the crowd on either side of the plaza stand columns
    of ARMED SOLDIERS: a formidable reminder of the king's
    power.

    Philip does nothing, but his presence intoxicates the
    crowd. As their cries swell, wave upon wave, the king's
    eyes glow and he breathes in deeply, feeding on his
    people's adoration.EXT. THAMES - DAY5                                                                 5A ripple of light on the water. A blur of approaching
    colour.May 1 Blue Draft--p.3
The ROYAL BARGE is gliding towards us, slowly taking shape:
its hull gaily painted, its canopy adorned with colourful
fabrics, its banks of oars rising and falling, casting
bright shards of shining water in the sunlight.People passing on the river bank point and wave, smiling,
cheering. They see the Queen now. They call out.

Two young men walking arm-in-arm stare more intently than
any; but they do not cheer or wave. There's something
chilling in the way they track the distant figure of the
Queen.

They are BABINGTON and SAVAGE.

Over this an insistent voice:HOWARD (V.O.)Why do you go among the people,
          majesty? I tell you plainly, you

    business of state is transacted. We catch glimpses of the
    Queen in their midst, preparing to leave, as her ministers
    try to persuade her of the seriousness of the situation:
    SIR CHRISTOPHER HATTON, 30s, an ambitious courtier; LORD
    HOWARD, 50s, a weathered old campaigner; and standing back
    from the rest, watching from the side lines, SIR FRANCIS

      WIDE NOW - We see the carriage and the royal party crest a
      hill, and there is revealed an awesome sight: the forest
      has been felled as far as the eye can see. Great piles of
      cut timber dot the ravaged landscape. Everywhere men are at
      work lopping branches from felled trees. Wagon teams haul
      immense trunks away. Fires burn stacks of lopped branches,
      and the smoke rises up into the empty sky.IN THE CARRIAGE - On Reston's face as he stares at the
      fires. He speaks half to himself, out of the depths of his
      own fanatical certainty.RESTONThe light of purifying fire.

Every Sunday the Queen processes here, and crowds gather to
see her. Two of Walsingham's men, AGENTS 1 and 2, mingle in

crowd. He carries a bag which may or may not contain a gun.Abustle of activity, a ripple of anticipation - `She's
coming!' - and the palace doors open.

BABINGTON'S POV: the crowd, the wall of BODYGUARDS, the
cluster of COURTIERS and LADIES, and in their midst,
Elizabeth, almost completely masked as she passes by.
Alongside the Queen, among her maids-of-honour, is Bess
Throckmorton; behind her, Walsingham.

her, fall to their knees.CROWDGod bless your majesty - God love

crowd. Nearby there stands another young man who is
watching, not cheering: RAMSAY.

baby, smiling, putting out her hand to touch the baby's         
head. The mother bobs a curtsey. The Queen moves on, with

      Raleigh a quick smile as she follows the royal party. His
      answering shrug says: I tried. He picks up the cloak, and
      stands gazing after the Queen.

     They see Raleigh now, and the chatter ceases. The ladies
     come to a stop and curtsey. Raleigh gives a bow, his eyes
     singling out Bess.RALEIGHI'm glad to have the opportunity
               to thank you. Without your help,

     The ladies go on their way and the laughing chatter
     resumes, with many a backward glance at the handsome
     Raleigh. No one pays attention to a figure in the shadows,

     faced, half-mumbling, half-singing an endless prayer. He
     holds a pistol with which he means to kill himself. But he
     can't do it.         SAVAGE(singing)

     In a clearing nearby three men sit round a fire. They are
     young Catholic fanatics - Babington, Ramsay, and FRANCIS
     THROCKMORTON. A fourth man stands before them, his back to
     us, watching Savage. At first we don't see who he is.May 1 Blue Draft - p.25RESTON (O.O.V.)His weakness endangers us all. He
          can't go on with us. And we can't
          leave him behind.

Now the man turns and looks intently at Babington, and we      
see he is Robert Reston; no longer in the clothes of a
priest.RESTONWho will help him?

Babington rises. Reston nods his approval. Babington goes      
off through the trees. Reston and the others follow a
little behind.SAVAGE(singing)

He sings on as Babington approaches him, seeming no longer
to know what's happening. Babington takes the pistol from
his hand.BABINGTONMake your peace with God.

Savage stares, and suddenly realises what Babington means
to do. Terror overwhelms him.SAVAGENo, Tom! Don't kill me! I don't
          want to die!

Now he's blubbering with fear. Babington is shaken by this,
and can't shoot.

Reston begins to pray aloud.RESTONSi ambulam in medio umbrae
          mortis, non timebo mala -

The others join in with the words of the well-known psalm.     
Babington too joins in, now weeping.RESTON AND OTHERSQuoniam tu mecum es, Domine.

     disappears. He opens his arms wide.WALSINGHAMWilliam!WILLIAMHello, Francis.

     Walsingham shares a rueful smile with William that says,
     `Women, eh?'. They take their seats for dinner.2INT. GREAT HALL, WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY7                                                                27Elizabeth sits sumptuously gowned and jewelled at an               
     ornately-dressed dining table, surrounded by her ladies,           
     Bess among them; Walsingham discreetly in the background.
     They're listening to a young Austrian make a formal speech
     of love. The AUSTRIAN AMBASSADOR stands to one side,
     mouthing the words to prompt him.

     The ARCHDUKE CHARLES is still a boy: sixteen years old,
     slight, pale, trembling with shyness. He struggles through
     his rehearsed speech.ARCHDUKE CHARLESYour majesty's beauty is dazzling

     Raleigh enters the Great Hall, trailed by Calley, as the
     dinner gets under way. They join the much larger group who         
     simply stand and watch. Royal meals are in part a spectacle
     for the court. A JESTER moves from group to group, playing
     pranks on the guests.Green Revision May 25 - p.29A

Raleigh is now dressed in court fashion, and looks very
well; as the glances of several court ladies show. He
catches Bess's eye and they share a smile.COURT LADYSo tell me, Mr Raleigh, in your
          sea battles - how do you sink an
          enemy ship? You shoot holes in
          its sides, I suppose.(May 1 Blue Draft - p.30RALEIGHNo, ma'am. A sunk ship is of no
          value. The object is to capture
          and command.COURT LADYAnd how do you do that?RALEIGHSurprise. Speed. Irresistible
          violence.

Calley, listening, rolls his eyes.

Elizabeth, at the table with the Archduke by her side,
glances towards Raleigh, and sees him flirting with the
court ladies. Then back to the young Archduke, who has
hardly touched his food.ELIZABETHI think you're not as accustomed
          as I am to eating in public. I
          have a secret.

pane of glass. As she looks, she sees Bess staring at
someone - follows her gaze - and is amused to find that the
object of her attention is also Raleigh.ELIZABETHThey can see me, but they can't
          hear me, or touch me. You should
          try it.

Elizabeth turns back to her guest.ELIZABETHHis highness is tired after his
          journey.

The young Archduke, frozen with shyness, sits staring
before him, trembling as he frames a proper reply.ARCHDUKE CHARLESNo man can be tired in the
          presence of so lovely a Queen.Elizabeth speaks so only he can hear, in German.ELIZABETH(You play the game very well, my
          young friend. But don't yousometimes feel an overwhelming

The Archduke's eyes open very wide. He glances at
Elizabeth, and sees on her face a conspiratorial smile.ARCHDUKE CHARLES(I daren't even think what I'm

He's grateful to her, and his shy face shows it.

Raleigh is still being entertained by the court ladies.COURT LADYI adore the natives you brought
          back with you. I don't suppose

nothing of the planets, but she feels it deep within
herself: her moment of destiny is near.ELIZABETHWhich empire is to rise, and
