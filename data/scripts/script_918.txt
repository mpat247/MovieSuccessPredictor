THE READERWritten byDavid HareBased on the novel by Bernhard SchlinkINT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. BERLIN. DAY. CREDITS1995. A modern apartment, all cool and glass. MICHAEL BERG is
          preparing breakfast, laying the table for two. He is 51, dark-
          haired, saturnine. He is doing everything with deliberate
          quietness, taking the occasional glance towards the bedroom
          to check he's not making too much noise. He is boiling an
          egg, which he takes out of boiling water and puts on a
          sparkling clean plate.MICHAEL puts the yolk-stained egg-cup and plate into the
          sink, his breakfast eaten, then, as noiseless as he can,
          turns on the tap to run water. The bedroom door opens, and
          BRIGITTE comes out, naked. She's attractive, younger. The
          credits end.BRIGITTEYou didn't wake me.MICHAELYou were sleeping.BRIGITTEYou let me sleep because you can't
                    bear to have breakfast with me.It's half-serious. MICHAEL doesn't react.MICHAELNothing could be further from the
                    truth. I boiled you an egg. See?MICHAEL produces a second boiled egg in a cup, seemingly from
          nowhere, like a magician, and puts it on the table.MICHAELI'd hardly have boiled you an egg
                    if I didn't want to see you. Tea or
                    coffee?BRIGITTE has re-appeared from the bedroom, now in a dressing
          gown. She's still half-serious.BRIGITTEDoes any woman ever stay long
                    enough to find out what the hell
                    goes on in your head?MICHAEL smiles to himself.BRIGITTEWhat are you doing tonight?2.MICHAELI'm seeing my daughter.BRIGITTEYour daughter? You've kept very
                    quiet about her.MICHAELHave I? She's been abroad for a
                    year. Did you say tea?INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. BERLIN. DAYMICHAEL kisses BRIGITTE on the cheek as she departs.BRIGITTEI'm going. Give my love to your
                    daughter.He closes the door, then turns to the open door of the
          bedroom. He looks at the mess of last night's love-making.
          Then he goes to the window and looks out. A yellow U-Bahn
          goes by.INT. TRAM. DAY.December 1958. MICHAEL, now 15, is sitting on a tram. He is
          in a well-cut suit he's inherited, ill-fitting, with two-tone
          shoes and tangled mop of hair. Sweat breaks out all over his
          face. A WOMAN is staring at him. He's plainly feeling ill.INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. DAY1995. MICHAEL stands at the window, looking out.INT. TRAM. DAY1958. Impulsively MICHAEL gets up, rings the bell and gets
          off at the next stop.INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. DAY1995. MICHAEL closes the window.EXT. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY1958. It has come on to rain. MICHAEL is walking along the
          street, looking more and more sickly. There is an archway
          leading to a courtyard, and impulsively he darts inside to
          get out of the rain. He begins to vomit. Opposite him is a
          wood workshop open to the yard. A uniformed TRAM CONDUCTRESS
          walks past.3.MICHAEL'S body is turned away, his face invisible, his hand
          over his mouth. She puts down her ticket machine on the
          pavement and seizes him by the arm.HANNAHey. Hey!HANNA SCHMITZ has ash-blonde hair and is in her mid-thirties.
          She disappears. He's sick again. She reappears with a bucket
          of water to sluice down the pavement. She wipes his face down
          with a wet cloth. Then she fills another bucket.HANNAHey, kid. Hey.MICHAELI'm sorry. I'm sorry.Effortlessly, HANNA takes MICHAEL in her arms. She holds his
          head against her breasts. MICHAEL buries himself and slowly
          he stops sobbing. Then he lifts his head.HANNAWhere do you live?EXT. STREET. DAYHANNA and MICHAEL walk at a fair pace along a street, dotted
          with the scaffolding of new building. HANNA is carrying his
          satchel, she is pulling him by the arm.EXT. BLUMENSTRASSE. DAYThey come up the road. It is now snowing. MICHAEL stops
          outside his block, as if nervous she might come in.MICHAELIt's here. I'll be fine now. Thank
                    you.HANNALook after yourself.MICHAEL smiles `Thank you' and goes in. HANNA is left alone.
          She looks round, frowning, then sets off, stopping
          uncertainly at the crossroads to check for the way she came.
          MICHAEL turns and watches, curious at her indecision.INT. BERG APARTMENT. BLUMENSTRASSE. NIGHTCARLA BERG is at the stove in the kitchen. She takes dinner
          through for the BERG family, at a round table in a
          traditional apartment, under a five-candled brass chandelier.4.MICHAEL'S father, PETER, is a balding, abstracted man, eating
          in oppressive silence. Next to him, his older brother THOMAS,
          18, his older sister, ANGELA, and his younger sister, EMILY.
          MICHAEL has his book in front of him, not touching his food.CARLAI'm worried about him. He looks
                    terrible.PETERThe boy's saying he doesn't need a
                    doctor.EMILYHe does.MICHAELI don't need a doctor.PETERGood then.CARLA looks reproachful.CARLAPeter.PETERWe're not going to argue about
                    this. People have to take
                    responsibility for their own lives.INT. BEDROOM. BERG APARTMENT. DAYMICHAEL is lying in a single bed, his face violently
          inflamed. CARLA is with the DOCTOR, a much older man.DOCTORRemind me, how old are you now?CARLAMichael's fifteen.DOCTORIt's scarlet fever. He'll be in bed
                    for several months. At least.MICHAEL turns into the pillow, a wet patch beneath his head.
          Delusional with fever, he senses a presence at the door. He
          turns. It's EMILY. But at once CARLA's arm pulls her away.CARLAKeep away. He's contagious.5.They vanish. The door closes. In the corridor the DOCTOR is
          heard.DOCTORBurn the sheets. Complete
                    isolation. And three months is the
                    minimum.INT & EXT. BERG APARTMENT. DAY1959. A sunny day in March. MICHAEL's bed has been moved
          beside open windows so he can profit from the weak sun. He is
          sitting up, working on his stamp collection. CARLA is moving
          round behind him, tidying the room.CARLAHow are you feeling?MICHAELBetter. By the way, I meant to tell
                    you, the day I got ill... a woman
                    helped me. A woman in the street.CARLAShe helped you?MICHAELYes. She brought me home.CARLADo you have her address?EXT. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAYMICHAEL is standing holding a small bunch of flowers. He is
          looking puzzled at a row of bells with numbers only. The
          woodyard is busy. WORKMEN come out of the building.INT. STAIRS & LANDING. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAYMICHAEL comes up the stairwell, once grand, now in decay -
          green linoleum and faded red paint. The sound of a
          sentimental song at the open door of a small apartment.
          Inside, HANNA is ironing in a sleeveless smock, blue with red
          flowers. Her hair is fastened in a clip. She looks at him a
          moment.HANNACome in.6.INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAYThe flat is without decoration, an enfilade of small rooms. A
          stove, a sink, a tub, a boiler, a table, a few wooden chairs.
          There is no window, just a balcony door to let light into the
          room. HANNA carries on ironing.MICHAELI brought you these flowers. To say
                    thank you.HANNAPut them down there.MICHAEL puts them beside the sink. HANNA has a blanket and a
          cloth over the table : nothing disturbs her rhythm, as she
          irons one piece of laundry after another, then folds it and
          puts it over one of the chairs.MICHAELI would have come earlier, but I've
                    been in bed for three months.HANNAYou're better now?MICHAELThank you.HANNAHave you always been weak?MICHAELOh no. I'd never been ill before.
                    It's incredibly boring. There's
                    nothing to do. I couldn't even be
                    bothered to read.HANNA carries on ironing. He is becoming as comfortable with
          the silence as she is. She starts ironing a pair of knickers.
          He watches her bare arms moving back and forth. She looks
          broad-planed, strong. She is at peace with being watched. She
          puts one pair of knickers down, then does another. Then she
          upends the iron.HANNAI have to go to work. I'll walk
                    with you. Wait in the hall while I
                    change.MICHAEL goes out into the hall. The kitchen door is slightly
          open. HANNA takes off her smock and stands in a green slip.
          Her stockings are hanging over the back of a chair.7.She picks one up, rolls it, smooths it up over her calf and
          knee, then attaches it to her suspender. She reaches for the
          other. The flesh is bare between her legs. MICHAEL watches,
          riveted. HANNA seems oblivious. But as she is about to put
          the second stocking on, she looks at him. She drops her
          dress, and straightens, holding her stare. In response, he
          blushes, then panics and runs out of the flat. The door
          slams.INT. STAIRS. DAYMICHAEL runs down the stairs in terror and shame, and out the
          front door.EXT. COURTYARD. DAYThe WORKMEN look up, curious, as MICHAEL flies by, slamming
          the outer door.INT. BEDROOM. DAWNMICHAEL is lying in bed. He looks up at the sound of a tram
          going by outside.EXT. STREET. DAWNThe tram making its way along the quiet street.INT. BEDROOM. DAWNMICHAEL gets out of bed and quickly gets dressed.INT. TRAM. DAYMICHAEL, reading a book, watches unobserved, fascinated as
          HANNA collects tickets. She calls out the name of the next
          stop. She doesn't see him as she works.EXT. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAYMICHAEL is standing on the other side   of the street from
          HANNA'S courtyard. He is in two minds   about whether to go in.
          The WOODWORKERS are loading a van. He   waits for them to
          finish before he slips in through the   archway, making his way
          to the stairs.INT. LANDING. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAYMICHAEL is sitting on the steps of the first landing. Then,
          as if from nowhere, HANNA is suddenly standing behind him, in
          uniform, carrying a box of coal in one hand, a scuttle in the
          other. She looks tired but not surprised to see him.8.HANNAThere are two more buckets
                    downstairs. You can fill them and
                    bring them up.HANNA walks straight past him. For a moment he tenses as if
          there might be some contact. But she goes by.INT. CELLAR. DAYMICHAEL opens the door. He turns on a dim light. There is a
          flight of wooden stairs into the murk of a huge pile of coke,
          poured in from the street. He goes down to the bottom, and
          picks up a bucket. He digs in to the coke, and at once it
          comes tumbling down on him in a cloud of dust.INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAYHANNA is at the kitchen table, drinking a glass of milk. She
          has taken off her jacket and loosened her tie. MICHAEL comes
          in with the two buckets of coal, his face and clothes filthy.
          She roars with laughter, full-throated.HANNAYou look ridiculous, look at you,
                    kid.MICHAEL sees himself in the mirror, but she has already got
          up, going towards the tub in the corner of the kitchen.HANNAYou can't go home like that. Give
                    me your clothes, I'll run you a
                    bath.HANNA opens the tap. There's a boiler, and steaming hot water
          comes out. MICHAEL takes off his sweater, then stops.HANNAWhat, do you always take a bath in
                    your trousers?HANNA takes his sweater and goes to open the balcony door. He
          undresses. She puts his sweater on the balcony rail.HANNAIt's all right, I won't look.On the contrary, she turns and walks straight towards him.
          MICHAEL is naked. HANNA takes his clothes from the chair. He
          gets into the bath. She goes to the balcony. In the bath, he
          submerges himself. HANNA goes out and shakes his clothes out
          in the open air.9.When he comes up from under the water, she is laying his
          clothes back on the chair. She picks up the shampoo and hands
          it to him.HANNAWash your hair, I'll get you a
                    towel.MICHAEL washes his hair, then submerges again. When he comes
          back up, HANNA is holding out a large towel. He gets out,
          turning away to hide his erection. From behind, she wraps his
          body and rubs him dry. Then she lets the towel fall. She puts
          her body against his back, and he realises she's naked. He
          turns and faces her.HANNASo. That's why you came back.MICHAEL looks at her, awed.MICHAELYou're so incredibly beautiful.HANNANow, kid, you know that's not true.At once she puts her arms round him and they kiss. MICHAEL
          goes down onto the floor, HANNA on top of him. All the time,
          she's staring into his eyes. He can't take it. He closes his
          eyes and, about to come, begins to scream. She puts her hand
          over his mouth to smother the noise.INT. DINING ROOM. BERG APARTMENT. NIGHTThe family is half-way through their meal. MICHAEL is sitting
          watching them eat, thinking about his lovemaking with HANNA.PETERYou've inconvenienced your mother.MICHAELHow many more times? I've said I'm
                    sorry.PETERYou scared her.MICHAELIt's hardly my fault, I got lost,
                    that's all. That's why I was late.
                    Can I have some more?He reaches for more stew. THOMAS goes on eating, a look of
          contempt on his face, too superior to engage in this.10.EMILYHow can anyone get lost in their
                    own home town?MICHAELThe doctor told me I had to take
                    walks.EMILYSo?MICHAELI meant to head for the castle, I
                    ended up at the sports-field.EMILYThey're in opposite directions.MICHAELIt's none of your business.EMILYHe's lying.CARLAHe's not lying. Michael never lies.CARLA smiles benignly. EMILY knows she's right. They all eat
          on for a few moments.MICHAELDad, I've decided, I want to go
                    back to school tomorrow.CARLAThe doctor says you need another
                    three weeks.MICHAELWell I'm going.CARLAPeter?PETERIf he wants to go back, then he
                    must.MICHAEL can't breathe, as if some decisive moment in his life
          has been reached. PETER is looking at him, seeming to know
          what's going on.11.EXT. SCHOOL. DAYA massive brownstone building. The whole SCHOOL is coming
          out, but MICHAEL is first, in a desperate hurry, waving
          goodbye to his friends and running quickly away.INT. STAIRS & LANDING. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAYMICHAEL comes quickly up the stairs. The door of HANNA'S
          apartment is ajar. He pushes it open.INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAYHANNA is at the sink. MICHAEL comes in, precipitate, tearing
          off his clothes and embracing her at the same time. He drops
          his trousers and lifts her onto the sink. He comes in about
          twenty seconds. He stands sweating.HANNAAll right, kid, it's not just about
                    you.INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAYThey are on the bed. He is lying underneath her. HANNA leads
          his hands to her face, then down her body. She begins to
          move, and in response, he moves too. He watches awed as she
          comes.INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAYHANNA has fallen asleep on MICHAEL'S chest. He is awake,
          looking at the birthmark on her left shoulder. The sound of
          the wood yard below. He kisses the birthmark. She stirs.MICHAELWhat's your name?She opens her eyes. A look of suspicion.HANNAWhat?MICHAELYour name.HANNAWhy do you want to know?MICHAELI've been here three times. You
                    haven't told me your name.12.MICHAEL waits a moment.HANNAIt's Hanna. What's yours, kid?MICHAELMichael.HANNAMichael. Hmm. So I'm with a
                    Michael.HANNA smiles, as if there were something funny about it.MICHAEL`Hanna'.INT. CLASSROOM. SCHOOL. DAYA TEACHER, in his sixties, has scrawled the words `Odysseus',
          `Hamlet' and `Faust' on the blackboard. The class of BOYS is
          attentive. Next to him, his friend HOLGER SCHLUTER. Across
          the way, RUDOLF.TEACHERThe notion of secrecy is central to
                    Western literature. You may say the
                    whole idea of character in fiction
                    is defined by people holding
                    specific information which for
                    various reasons - sometimes
                    perverse, sometimes noble - they
                    are determined not to disclose.MICHAEL looks content. The bell goes.INT. CORRIDOR. SCHOOL. DAYThe BOYS come pouring out cheerfully into the corridor and
          head to the next classroom. MICHAEL'S demeanour has changed.
          There's a knowingness, a swagger, a confidence which is new.
          MICHAEL lingers for a moment, then slopes off in the opposite
          direction, alone.EXT. SCHOOL. DAYMICHAEL comes out the back door of the school, unobserved,
          climbs over the railings and starts to run down the street.INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. EVELater. Dark. MICHAEL is almost asleep, HANNA awake.13.HANNAYou never tell me what you've been

                    dexteris aptantur enses conditi?MICHAEL smiles slightly.MICHAELIt's Horace.HANNAIt's wonderful.MICHAELDo you want some Greek?MICHAEL grins, pleased to be able to do something. He goes
          and gets his satchel. HANNA turns on a light.MICHAELOi men ippeon stroton oi de pesedon

                    about a play. By a writer called

You can read it.HANNAI'd rather listen to you.There is a silence as MICHAEL absorbs the idea.MICHAELAll right. I'm not very good.MICHAEL grins, embarrassed, then opens the book.MICHAELAct One. Scene One. The setting :

                    complaints, petitions, nothing but
                    petitions. For goodness' sake, just
                    imagine that people actually envy
                    us."15.INT. KITCHEN. NIGHTLater. They are in the bath together. HANNA takes a piece of
          soap and runs it lovingly down his cheek. Then she passes the

          MICHAEL appears walking alongside it and gets on.INT. TRAM. DAWNMICHAEL is sitting in the second carriage. He looks up. The
          CONDUCTRESS is HANNA. At first, she does not notice him.
          MICHAEL watches, waiting to be noticed. She turns round and
          looks at him. He smiles in greeting but she makes no
          acknowledgement at all. She turns away. He frowns,
          bewildered.EXT. TRAM. DAYThe tram is heading out of town.INT. TRAM. DAYHANNA is now talking animatedly to the DRIVER. They are
          getting on very well, laughing together and chatting. MICHAEL

          MICHAEL looks up expectantly. But as he holds up his ticket,
          HANNA makes no reaction except to clip it. She turns away
          without speaking. The tram comes to a halt again, and
          MICHAEL, humiliated, bolts for the door.EXT. ROAD. DAYMICHAEL watches the tram disappears up the hill. He looks

                    about justice. Forgive me, nor is
                    it about getting into an emotional
                    state. It has no purpose if it's

                    something called morality. But they
                    don't. They operate by something
                    called law. You're not guilty of
                    anything merely by working at

                    Auschwitz. Precisely 19 have been
                    convicted, and only 6 for murder.
                    To prove murder you have to prove
                    intent. That's the law. Remember,
                    the question is never `Was it
                    wrong?' but `Was it legal?' And not

                    certain number of women. Hanna
                    Schmitz chose differently.JUDGEIn what way differently?ILANAShe had favourites. Girls, mostly
                    young. We all remarked on it, she
                    gave them food and places to sleep.
                    In the evening, she asked them to

                    these women read aloud to her. They

                    more sensitive, she's more human,
                    she's kinder. Often she chose the

                    months.ROSEYes. It was the winter of 1944. Our
                    camp was closed down, we were told
                    we had to move on. But the plan
                    kept changing every day. Women were
                    dying all around us in the snow.
                    Half of us died on the march. My
                    daughter says in the book, less a
                    death march, more a death gallop.MICHAEL looks along the row to where ILANA is now sitting.JUDGEPlease tell us about the night in

                    were lucky because we had a roof
                    over our heads. We'd arrived in a
                    village, as always, the guards took
                    the best quarters, they took the
                    priest's house. But they let us
                    sleep in a church. There was a
                    bombing raid. In the middle of the
                    night. At first we could only hear
                    the fire, it was in the steeple.
                    Then we could see burning beams,
                    and they began to crash to the
                    floor. Everyone rushed, rushed to
                    the doors. But the doors had been
                    locked on the outside.49.JUDGEThe church burned down? Nobody came
                       to open the doors? Is that right?ROSENobody.JUDGEEven though you were all burning to
                       death?ROSE nods.JUDGEHow many people were killed?ROSEEveryone was killed.JUDGEHow did you survive?ROSEI needed to get away from the other
                       women. Because they were panicking,
                       they were screaming. I couldn't
                       stand it. I couldn't stand their
                       screaming. I was more frightened of
                       the other women than I was of the
                       fire. So I too my daughter and led
                       her to the upper floor. I can't
                       defend what I did. It's impossible
                       to defend. I took Ilana in my arms
                       and I led her towards the fire.
                       There was a small gallery at the
                       side of the church on the upper
                       level. It saved our lives. The

                    send it, alongside the 7,000 marks
                    in the bank, to the daughter who
                    wrote the book. It's for her. She
                    should decide what to do with it.
                    And tell Michael I said hello. Tell
                    him to get on with his life."MS BRENNER looks at him.MS BRENNERDo you want to see her?76.MICHAEL shakes his head.EXT. BRIDGE. MANHATTAN. DAYMICHAEL rides in a taxi into Manhattan. A view of the
          familiar skyline.EXT. FIFTH AVENUE. DAYMICHAEL'S taxi comes up Fifth Avenue. It draws up outside an
          expensive apartment block. MICHAEL gets out and goes in, the
          Manhattan skyline opening up behind him.INT. LIVING ROOM. ILANA'S APARTMENT. DAYA superbly appointed space full of great and expensive art.
          MICHAEL has taken his coat off. ILANA MATHER appears,
          elegant, well-dressed - on the surface, the spirit of
          prosperous New York. She is now in her early fifties.MICHAELMs Mather?ILANAYes. You're Michael Berg. I was
                    expecting you.ILANASo you must tell me: what exactly
                    brings you to the United States?MICHAELI was already here. I was at a
                    conference in Boston.ILANAYou're a lawyer?MICHAELYes.ILANAI was intrigued by your letter but
                    I can't say I wholly understood it.
                    You attended the trial?MICHAELYes. Almost twenty years ago. I was
                    a law student. I remember you, I
                    remember your mother very clearly.77.ILANAMy mother died in Israel - a good
                    many years ago.MICHAELI'm sorry.MICHAEL hesitates for a moment.ILANAGo on, please.MICHAELPerhaps you heard. Hanna Schmitz
                    recently died. She killed herself.ILANA shakes her head.ILANAShe was a friend of yours?MICHAELA kind of friend. It's as simple as
                    this. Hanna was illiterate for the
                    greater part of her life.ILANAIs that an explanation of her
                    behaviour?MICHAELNo.ILANAOr an excuse?MICHAEL shakes his head.MICHAELNo. No. She taught herself to read
                    when she was in prison. I sent her
                    tapes. She'd always liked being
                    read to.ILANA shifts slightly.ILANAWhy don't you start by being honest
                    with me? At least start that way.
                    What was the nature of your
                    friendship?78.MICHAELWhen I was young I had an affair
                    with Hanna.ILANA looks at him for a moment.ILANAI'm not sure I can help you, Mr.
                    Berg. Or rather, even if I could
                    I'm not willing to.MICHAELI was almost sixteen when I took up
                    with her. The affair only lasted a
                    summer. But.ILANABut what?MICHAEL just looks at her.ILANAI see. And did Hanna Schmitz
                    acknowledge the effect she'd had on
                    your life?MICHAEL stares back, understood for the first time.MICHAELShe'd done much worse to other
                    people. I've never told anyone.ILANAPeople ask all the time what I
                    learned in the camps. But the camps
                    weren't therapy. What do you think
                    these places were? Universities? We
                    didn't go there to learn. One
                    becomes very clear about these
                    things.ILANA looks at him, unrelenting.ILANAWhat are you asking for?
                    Forgiveness for her? Or do you just
                    want to feel better yourself? My
                    advice, go to the theatre, if you
                    want catharsis. Please. Go to
                    literature. Don't go to the camps.
                    Nothing comes out of the camps.
                    Nothing.79.ILANA looks at him, unrelenting.MICHAELWhat she wanted...what she wanted
                    was to leave you her money. I have
                    with me.ILANATo do what?MICHAELAs you think fit.MICHAEL reaches for his briefcase. He takes out the lavender
          tea-tin, which he sets down on the table in front of ILANA.MICHAELHere.ILANA lifts the tin.ILANAWhen I was a little girl, I had a
                    tea-tin for my treasures. Not quite
                    like this. It had Cyrillic
                    lettering. I took it with me to the
                    camp, but it got stolen.MICHAELWhat was in it?ILANAOh. Sentimental things. A piece of
                    hair from our dog. Some tickets to
                    operas my father had taken me to.
                    It wasn't stolen for its contents.
                    It was the tin itself which was
                    valuable, what you could do with
                    it.She sits a moment, overcome, her hand on the tin.ILANAThere's nothing I can do with this
                    money. If I give it to anything
                    associated with the extermination
                    of the Jews, then to me it will
                    seem like absolution and that is
                    something I'm neither willing nor
                    in a position to grant.MICHAEL nods slightly.80.MICHAELI was thinking maybe an
                    organization to encourage literacy.ILANAGood.There's a silence.ILANAGood.MICHAELDo you know if there's a Jewish
                    organization?ILANAI'll be surprised if there isn't.
                    There's a Jewish organisation for
                    everything. Not that illiteracy is
                    a very Jewish problem.There is the shadow of a smile.ILANAWhy don't you find out? Send them
                    the money.MICHAELShall I do it in Hanna's name?ILANAAs you think fit.ILANA smiles slightly. She puts her hand on top of the tin.ILANAI'll keep the tin.INT. ILANA'S HOUSE. DAYILANA is standing at the window watching down to the street
          where MICHAEL is walking away. She has the tin in her hand.
          When he's vanished, she turns and goes into her bedroom.
          There on the dressing table, there is a framed photo of ILANA
          with her mother in Germany before the war. She sets the tin
          down beside the photo.INT & EXT. CAR. DAY1995. MICHAEL is driving JULIA in the big Mercedes through
          the German countryside. He is tense, silent. JULIA takes a
          sideways look at him, but he does not respond.81.JULIAWhere are we going?MICHAELI thought you liked surprises.JULIAI do. I do like surprises.EXT. COUNTRY. DAYThey draw up at a church. It is the same one he and HANNA
          passed on their bicycles years before. MICHAEL and JULIA get
          out and walk towards the graveyard at the side.EXT. CEMETERY. DAYMICHAEL & JULIA stand at a deserted grave-side. The whole
          cemetery is seen. MICHAEL stoops down and uncovers a simple
          stone : HANNA SCHMITZ 1923-1988. JULIA watching, says her
          name.JULIAHanna Schmitz.JULIA waits a moment.JULIAWho was she?MICHAELThat's what I wanted to tell you.
                    That's why we're here.JULIA looks, waiting. MICHAEL looks for a moment as if he
          will not go on.JULIASo tell me.There is a moment, then they turn to stroll, MICHAEL talking,
          starting to tell the story.MICHAELI was 15, I was coming home from
                    school, I was ill...They walk away among the trees.FADE TO BLACK
