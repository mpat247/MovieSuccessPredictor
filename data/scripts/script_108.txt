Shooting Script  2/26/91------------------------------------------------------------------------------1	  GRAINY BLACK AND WHITE - CLOSE-UP - A MAN'S DESPERATE FACE	 1This is Ash, mid twenties, square jaw firmly set and a pair of
	   haunted eyes which dart about quickly in fear. Ash speaks to
	   the CAMERA with urgency:ASHWhy would you say that I am
			   insane?  I wouldn't say that I've
			   lost my mind simply because I've
			   heard the voices and seen the
			   godless things moving in the
			   woods. If anything, I think more
			   clearly now than ever before. I
			   know now that there is such a
			   thing as a living Evil. A dark
			   and shapeless thing that lives
			   not in the spaces we know, but
			   between them. In the Dark. In the
			   night. And it wants the exact same
			   thing as you and I: a chance at
			   warm life on this Earth. It
			   doesn't care that is already had
			   that chance ...once. Now listen
			   closely because there isn't much
			   time. Listen and believe, because
			   it's all true.DISSOLVE TO:2	  EXT. A LOG CABIN - NIGHT								2nestled in a dark forest. Through the window, we see the tiny
	   figure of Ash picking up a book from a desk.ASH (V.O.)I first saw the damn thing at that
			   blasted cabin. The Necronomicon.
			   An ancient Sumarrian text, bound
			   in human flesh and inked in human
			   blood. It contained bizarre burial
			   rites, prophesies...and
			   instruction for demon
			   resurrection. It was never meant
			   for the world of the living.DISSOLVE TO:3	  INT. CABIN - NIGHT									 3Ash flips through the pages from the BOOK OF THE DEAD.ASH (V.O.)The book awoke something dark in

	   white eyes.5	  EXT. WOODS - NIGHT									 5We take the point of view of a wind-like demon, swooping low
	   through the woods toward the cabin.  CAMERA rips through the
	   cabin door and comes upon a SCREAMING Ash.ASH (V.O.)It got into my hand and it went
			   bad.6	  CLOSE ON ASH'S POSSESSED HAND							6twisting into a claw, before the flashing thunder clouds.ASH (V.O.)So I lopped it off at the wrist.7	  INT. CABIN - NIGHT									 7ASH severs his hand from his wrist with the chainsaw.8	  BLOOD RED CLOUDS									   8sweep past the moon.ASH (V.O.)In order to rid myself of the foul
			   thing, I read from a passage in
			   the book that was supposed to open
			   a hole.  A hole in Time that would
			   send the Evil back. And it worked.9	  A BANDAGED, ONE HANDED ASH							   9recites the incantation from the Necronomicon.10	 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT									 10The Time vortex is created.  Trees and a 1973 Delta 88
	   Oldsmobile are sucked up into the funnel cloud.ASH (V.O.)...I just didn't plan on coming
			   along.11	 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT									 11Ash, now armed with shotgun and chainsaw, is swallowed by the
	   funnel-cloud of the Time vortex.12	 INT. TIME VORTEX									   12Ash is rocketing through a funnel of swirling clouds.  He is
	   swept away from us, hand over foot, through the dark void of
	   Time.13	 ANIMATION - A TENDRIL OF SMOKE						    13swirls through blackness as a chorus of women's voices build
	   to eerie crescendo, from a musical note to a SCREAM.  The smoke
	   swirls, pulls in upon itself, like a thing alive, and forms the
	   words:"BRUCE CAMPBELL""Vs"
	   The smoke is wisked away, then reforms as..."THE ARMY OF DARKNESS"The title billows past CAMERA REVEALING...14	 INT. TIME VORTEX									   14A GRANDFATHER CLOCKits hands winding backwards at an insane rate, spins angrily

	   stone wall. Her eyes harden as she sees the first of the
	   shackled prisoners: a semi-conscious Ash.
	   She flushes with anger and races up to him. She spits and kicks
