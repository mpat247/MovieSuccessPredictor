          Parrott looks to Sukeforth who keeps his eyes on Rickey.SUKEFORTHDo what, Mr. Rickey?RICKEYI'm going to bring a Negro
          ballplayer to the Brooklyn Dodgers.PARROTTWith all due respect, sir, have you

          Kansas City Monarchs JOHN SCOTT stands at bat. The catcher's
          attention on the RUNNER DANCING off first. Stomping a foot,
          feinting, hard to see clearly in the glare of the lights.CATCHERWhere'd you learn to move like

          INSERT: Birmingham, Alabama. April 8, 1945. 
          On the first pitch the runner takes off. The catcher fires to
          second. See it from his POV as the runner slides in “SAFE!”
          A foot on the bag, the runner dusts off, heckles the catcher:RUNNERIs that the best you got?! Huh?!
          I'm going to steal nine, ten bases
          today! You better start counting!
          The catcher frowns. Standing, we see he is a big, big man.CATCHER(ALABAMAN)Where's your shortstop from?JOHN SCOTT(LOUISIANAN)California.CATCHERHe's got a mouth on him.
          Shaking his head, the catcher gets back in his crouch,
          signals the PITCHER. On the wind-up, the Runner is off
          again. The catcher fires to THIRD: “Safe!”RUNNERYou got a rag arm, catcher!CATCHERSteal home! You'll find out what
          kind of arm I got!DBL. BLUE REV 7-9-12 3.RUNNEROkay, I'm coming!
          The Catcher looks over at Scott who chuckles.CATCHERCalifornia, huh?(SCOTT NODS)Well California here he goes, if he
          comes down here.
          The Catcher gets back down in his squat. Signals the
          pitcher: fastball. Scott digs in, ready. The runner dancing
          off third. Here comes the wind-up...
          The Runner takes off even as the pitcher fires it in. The
          Birmingham Catcher receives it. As the Runner slides --
          The Catcher intentionally drives his glove, the ball and both
          hands into the runner's face -- WHALLOP! Sound drops as
          we're knocked flat senseless along with the runner.

          The umpire passes one hand over the other: Safe. Jack looks
          over at the catcher, gives him a pointed look as he goes --
          The catcher shoves him in the back. Jack turns, shoves back.

          As Parrott sets them on the desk, they start to slide off,

          As the attendant shoves down a pump, starts filling, Jack

          Sukeforth who raises a hand as if to say: Give it a chance.RICKEY (CONT'D)Baseball's a hard life; a man needs
          a good woman by his side. You
          don't want the only person waiting
