                                                        Dec. 12, 2011CHYRON -- ATLANTA 6:12 AMEXT. SOMEWHAT SEEDY TWO-STORY HOTEL IN ATLANTA -- PRE-DAWNIt's still more night than day as we look down on the HOTEL
          ATLANTA. The lit sign for the HOTEL ATLANTA may be the only
          source of light as we hear a metallic rattle.EXT. HOTEL ATLANTA -- SECOND FLOOR -- PRE-DAWNWe follow the metallic rattle to a door. The rattling stops
          and we watch the knob slowly turn.
                         
          Tight on a feminine arm with a tattoo that announces "hope."
          We pull back to find that both arms are employed in the
          pulling of what looks like a large suitcase.
                         
          NICOLE MAGGEN, a beautiful but tired woman, finishes pulling
          the suitcase that we now surmise to be a folded-up massage
          table out of the motel room. With her bra in one hand and
          the rickety table resting against the wall of the exterior
          2nd floor hallway of the motel, she assesses her situation.
                         
          She digs in her purse, lights a cigarette and continues
          digging in her purse. She finds a beat-up candy tin. She
          opens it and quickly sorts through a collection of burnt
          foils, heroin foils, looking for residue. Nothing.
                         
          She now finds and holds up the 100 bucks she just made. She
          flips open her cheap phone and makes a call...she thinks
          better of it and hangs up.EXT. HOTEL ATLANTA -- PARKING LOT -- MOMENTS LATERNICOLE forces the clumsy table into the hatchback of a 1988
          Toyota Tercel and slams it shut.INT. 1988 TOYOTA TERCEL -- PARKING LOT -- SAME TIMEWe hear the electronic ring of her cheap cell phone on
          "speaker phone" mode. The phone rests on the passenger seat.
          We pull up to find NICOLE slumped with her head resting on
          the steering wheel. She is exhausted and irritated...NICOLE(as the phone rings)
           Don't pick up...don't pick up...
           don't pick up...2.A MAN answers with music in the background..."Yo.." NICOLE
          quickly picks up the phone.NICOLE (CONT'D)It's Nic, do you have any? Good
           morning to you too. You're what?
           Well, where are you guys shooting
           today? Where? Text me the
           address. You have some...Okay.
                         
          She hangs up the phone and catching herself in the rearview
          she tries to smile.CHYRON -- ORLANDO 7:14 AMEXT. AMERICAN VALUE SUITES - HOTEL -- ORLANDO -- MORNINGThe sun would be rising if the sky wasn't swirling with grey
          clouds. We see the American Suites Hotel and recognize it as
          a decent commuters' hotel near the airport in Orlando. The
          sound of a clock radio breaks the calm of our picture.INT. AMERICAN VALUE SUITES - HOTEL -- ORLANDO -- MORNINGThrough the clock radio we loudly hear two morning drive-time
          radio personalities spewing nonsensical patter...
                         
          An attractive YOUNG WOMAN wrestles free of the covers and
          gets out of bed. She crosses naked through the room as a
          cell phone starts ringing.
                         
          Back to the bed as WHIP WHITAKER rises into frame and
          inhabits the room like a lazy ape at the zoo. WHIP wears his
          40 some years of life experience like a medal. Smoke hangs
          in the air and empty beers, a pint of vodka and two empty
          carafes of cheap hotel wine clutter the table as WHIP
          snatches up his phone and answers...VOICEFor the love of Christ! Look...just
           hold...HOLD ON.
                         
          He aggressively drains the last four inches of beer from a
          clear bottle and cracks the last fresh one that bobs in the
          hotel ice bucket.
                         
          The naked, YOUNG WOMAN bends over to pick up her clothes.
                         
          We witness her ass as a tanned glass vase with a perfect
          crack down the middle. Whip smiles, taking it all in...3.WHIP(into the phone)
           I've been up since the crack 'a
           dawn. What check? Tuition? How
           much does it cost to go there?
                         
          The YOUNG WOMAN has re-lit the last half of a joint and is
          puffing it to life as WHIP is beckoning with his large hands.
                         
          The YOUNG WOMAN, looking more like a stripper by the second,
          hands the joint to WHIP who takes a masterful drag. WHIP
          shakes his head in violent disapproval to what he hears on
          the phone. He exhales in anger as he shouts into the phone.WHIP (CONT'D)NO! NO! NO! You decided he needed
           private school...lemme talk to
           Knuckles. He's not? Tell'em the
           phone works both ways. Oh he's my
           son because you need a tuition
           check...that's great Deana. I'm
           glad you tracked me down in Orlando
           at 7 in the fucking morning to
           shake me down for money. Does he
           even like the fucking school? No
           I've never seen it. Yeah I wonder
           why not too. I gotta 9 o'clock
           flight, sit tight 'till I get back
           to Atlanta. How am I a liar?
           What? No, I'll call you.
                         
          WHIP hangs up and continues to make quick work of the last
          beer as he stares through his thoughts and out the window.YOUNG WOMANWas that your wife?WHIPThat was my ex-wife. But you
           Trina, you could be my second or
           third wife if you'd just C'mere.
                         
          The YOUNG WOMAN we now know as TRINA smiles seductively...TRINAWhip, don't even joke about that.
           Our flight's at 9, let's hit it.
                         
          TRINA is still naked but she holds a navy blue skirt and a
          white blouse as she hands WHIP his pants. WHIP can't help
          but pat that perfect ass as TRINA tries to skip away.
                         
          ON THE RADIO We hear the opening bars of a familiar rock
          anthem...JOE COCKER's "I'm Feeling Alright"4.WHIPYeah, I'm feelin' a little light-
           headed. I shoulda ate somethin'.
                         
          WHIP leans over the motel table, picks up a soda straw that's
          been cut in half. He efficiently sniffs up a line of coke.INT. AMERICAN VALUE SUITES HOTEL-ORLANDO-HALLWAY-MORNINGWHIP wears his pilot Blues and carries his hat as he strides
          confidently down the hallway. JOE COCKER continues to wail,
          perfectly narrating the hero's swagger that WHIP maintains
          while passing bad light fixtures and ornate wall paper.EXT. AIRPORT SOUTHJET TARMAC - AIRPLANE - MORNING RAININGWHIP leans against the landing gear of the JACKSON-RIDGEFIELD
          88 PASSENGER JET -- He takes a swig from a small bottle of
          mouthwash -- gargles, then spits the green foam on the
          tarmac. WHIP wipes fatigue from his face as he stashes the
          mouthwash in his pocket, then quickly completes his visual
          walk around. He looks at the sky again as he steps on to the
          jet way ladder. His foot slips, sending his shoe SPLASHING in
          to a puddle.WHIPSon of a bitch!
                         
          Whip shakes the rain out of his shoe as he continues up the
          stairs.INT. ORLANDO AIRPORT TERMINAL - JETWAY -- DAYWHIP enters the jetway from the exterior door at the entrance
          of the plane. TRINA is greeting a MAN and his SON.WHIPMorning Miss Marquez.TRINAMorning Captain Whitaker.
                         
          WHIP waits as TRINA politely parts the stream of folks to
          allow WHIP to enter the plane.INT. AIRPLANE GALLEY -- MOMENTS LATERWHIP exchanges a look with a MATURE FLIGHT ATTENDANT,
          MARGARET THOMASON. She can't help but smile...5.MARGARETCaptain Whitaker, that sky gonna
           hold? You're not gonna make me
           spend another night in Orlando?WHIPDon't worry, Margaret I'm gonna get
           you home for your prayer meeting
           at...what is it? Jesus Christ
           Superstar 27th Baptist King Church?
                         
          TRINA and CAMELIA SATOU, the other flight attendant, laugh.MARGARETThat's right, Christ the King First
           Baptist Church on Hazel and 9th
           Street. And I'm still saving you a
           seat next to me. Offer
           stands...come on down.WHIPOne of these nights, Margaret, I'm
           comin'. You hold my seat.
                         
          The girls laugh at the familiar exchange.INT. AIRPLANE COCKPIT - MORNINGWHIP enters the cockpit, removes his hat and nods to KEN
          EVANS, our clean-cut, young first officer.WHIPG'morning. Walk around is complete.
                         
          Whip pulls his emergency oxygen mask off the bulkhead and
          takes a huge hit.WHIP (CONT'D)Emergency oxygen, checks.
           (offering the mask toEVANS)You want a hit?EVANSNo thank you sir.WHIP(tries to break the chill)
           My pleasure to share the chair with
           ya'. Didn't we fly together...
                         
          EVANS lets him hang...6.EVANSNo sir, not that I remember. Ken
           Evans, sir.WHIPCall me Whip.EVANSYes sir.
                         
          WHIP studies this little Bible Thumper for a second before...WHIP(calls to the galley)
           Margaret.(SHE APPEARS)Sweetie, will you get me a coffee,
           black, lots of sugar. And some
           aspirin. You want something?EVANS(looks to Margaret)
           No ma'am. Thank you.(SHE LEAVES)Sir, it's 8:50.WHIPThen let's push. I got a great `on

           feeling today, sir?
                         
          WHIP focuses on EVANS, trying to read into that statement.WHIPTired, sir. But, this is a quick
           turn for me. Ten turns in three
           days. Off tomorrow.
                         
          MARGARET returns with the coffee, placing it down near WHIP's
          chair on an airline cocktail napkin.MARGARETHere's your coffee and the final
           manifest. 102 souls on board.WHIPThank you, thank you, thank you,
           you're a life saver. And Margaret

           push.7.WHIP goes to the head. MARGARET and EVANS exchange a look.CUT TO:EXT. ATLANTA SUBURB - STONE MANSION - DRIVEWAY - DAYNICOLE gets out of her Tercel and slams the door twice before
          it closes. She checks the address on her phone and looks up
          at the enormous mansion.INT. ATLANTA -- STONE - MANSION - DAYNICOLE pushes through the overly tall front door of the
          house. At first glance, it's completely empty, unfurnished.
          A GUY in cargo pants and a baseball hat sleeps sitting up
          against the huge dual staircase that leads to the second
          floor. Random boxes of video equipment are now evident as
          are thick cables that lead to a staircase going down.
                         
          On the staircase she immediately encounters another YOUNG
          CREW GUY holding a tiny lap dog while standing next to a
          NAKED GIRL wearing a Shakespearean Military Helmet. The
          YOUNG CREW GUY holds up the "be quiet" finger to his lips.
                         
          NICOLE quietly makes her way down a few steps, stopping at
          the odd duo. We now hear activity downstairs, music.
          SUDDENLY the YOUNG CREW GUY frantically points at the NAKEDGIRL.NAKED GIRL IN HELMETOthello you bastard!
                         
          And she grabs the TINY DOG and hustles downstairs. NICOLE
          waits with the YOUNG CREW GUY until we hear....KIP (O.S.)CUT! CUT THAT!NICOLE is free to walk all the way downstairs now.INT. MANSION - OTHELLO PORN SET - BEDROOM SUITE - DAYNICOLE enters to reveal a large porn set with a Shakespearean
          theme, specifically "Othello." We see an Elizabethan Four-
          poster bed with a canopy surrounded by stone arches and
          cardboard Venetian Columns. In the bed we find an AFRICAN
          AMERICAN PORN ACTOR laying with TWO FEMALE ADULT ACTORS.
                         
          A GIRL WITH DYED-BLONDE HAIR stands naked next to the throne
          smoking a joint as she shaves her crotch with a man's
          electric razor.8.NICOLE approaches a YOUNG TATTOOED MAN who only wears board
          shorts. He's talking with an OLDER ASIAN MAN as they groom a
          pile of coke for snorting.NICOLEKIP-He sniffs a quick line and gets up to kiss her, she turns her
          cheek avoiding the coke-frozen kiss.KIPNicole, this is Tiki Pot. He's my

           knows a lot about porn.NICOLEKip I need 2 grams of "h."KIPTiki and I are trying to put the

          smile breaks across her face. She exhales slowly. She
          reaches for the now burning cigarette when the second wave of
          heavy drugs hits. NICOLE looks up with fear.

          Next she grabs her phone, flipping it open. As she tries to
          dial it, she crumbles to her knees. NICOLE somewhat controls
          her fall to the ground, but her eyes are fading. The little
          bag of coke falls from her fingers.

          NICOLE's arms stretch out in a frozen reach as her body sinks
          to the floor. On her back like a girl making angels in the
          snow as her eyelids flutter, she slips away.

          CHARLIE ducks out of the room. WHIP is alone and still
          getting his bearings. He goes to scratch his head and
          catches sight of his left hand. It's swollen and sore --his
          wrist is bandaged with a splint-brace. He now looks at both
          of his hands in wonder.
                         
          WHIP hears a muffled conversation that gets clearer as do the

           with you after a major incident
           like the one you had today.
                         
          WHIP nods as his senses are getting sharper.NTSB OFFICER #1 (CONT'D)You are in a hospital in South

           explain your medical situation.
                         
          WHIP offers a "thumbs up" gesture. The DOCTOR steps in.DOCTORI'm Doctor Kenan and the good news
           is that you are in good condition.
           You did suffer a concussion which
           is the reason you have a bit of
           blurred vision and a headache. You
           have numerous lacerations around
           your left eye. We're going to leave
           the patch on for a few days as a
           precaution. But it seems your eye
           is OK. MRI's show strained tendons
           in your left knee and ankle but you
           didn't break any bones.43.You have some deep bruising in your
           left thigh and you have a few torn
           ligaments in your left wrist.
           Nothing serious. So as soon as we
           clear you from the concussion, and
           you feel well enough -- you can go
           home. That could be a day, could
           be 3 days. Okay?
                         
          WHIP quietly nods. The DOCTOR leaves and WHIP begins to
          study his body. His left leg is wrapped, his left wrist has
          a splint-brace --NTSB OFFICER #1I won't ask too much of you
           tonight, but as I said, the NTSB is
           required to make initial contact.

          expertly swallows them without water. He grabs WHIP's
          medical chart and scours it as he prattles on...HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)We want the premium stuff. Blue
           label...not the fucking well shit.

          HARLING hands WHIP a pack of smokes from his pocket. He also
          pulls out a carton of smokes from his backpack.HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)Here is a fresh carton, enjoy. You
           fucking earned it -- you smoke your
           nuts off, champion. If I were you

          HARLING hears him this time and raises his hand and nods,
          putting the VODKA back in his own duffel. HARLING tosses a

          HARLING puts his hand on WHIP's forehead in an attempt to
          reassure him. A quiet moment before HARLING slips out.INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- 11 PM -- SAME EVENINGWHIP wakes up in a cold sweat. He is breathing heavy as he
          scans the room. LIGHTENING FLASHES from outside the window.
          Thunder RUMBLES.
                         
          WHIP looks to the night stand where we see a pack of nicotine
          gum has been chewed through. WHIP uses his hands to get to
          the edge of the bed. He roots through the duffle bag that
          HARLING left and finds a pack of smokes and a Bic lighter
          still in its package.
                         
          Determined to smoke, WHIP eyes a WHEEL CHAIR that has been
          placed next to his bed. Leaning against the wheelchair is a
          medical cane.INT. HOSPITAL -- QUIET HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATERWearing his Happi Coat (or robe), WHIP limps in to the empty
          hallway with the use of his cane. He checks the quiet
          corridor as he begins his quest...53.INT. HOSPITAL -- FIRE DOOR -- 11:38 PMThe door swings open, and no one appears to be on the other
          side. Now WHIP fights to push the heavy door open again to
          slip through. A hand grabs the door and holds it. WHIP
          walks into the sanctity of the stairwell.INT. HOSPITAL STAIRWELL -- SAME TIMEWe find the owner of the helping hand was NICOLE who returns
          to a quiet spot along the wall of the stairwell as she
          demurely smokes a cigarette.WHIPThank you.
                         
          WHIP leans his cane against the wall and carefully pulls a
          pack of smokes from his pocket.WHIP (CONT'D)I didn't think anyone would have
           the same devious thought about
           using the fire stairs to have a
           smoke...
                         
          NICOLE smiles and looks down, awkward around men when she is
          not loaded. She drops her cigarette which we see was barely
          smoked as she maneuvers to leave.WHIP (CONT'D)Don't go. I'll be quiet.
                         
          He offers her a cigarette, she takes it.WHIP (CONT'D)We don't have to talk. Be nice to
           just smoke with someone.
                         
          And they do. They sit in silence as the stairwell fills up
          with smoke. After a long beat...NICOLEWere you on the plane?
                         
          WHIP studies her, she's beautiful in an exhausted way...WHIPYeah, I was. Were you?

          Again it falls silent as we let them smoke and think in the
          sanctity of the fire stairs.
                         
          A VOICE breaks their silence.VOICE (O.S.)Tobacco's but an Indian weed,

          dressed in a hospital gown and carrying an I.V. pole on which
          hangs a small bag of clear liquid. The man's hair has
          completely left him. His skin is gray. Eyes hollowed from

          The GOD topic has silenced the stairwell...GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D)As soon as you realize that the
           random events in your life are
           God...you will live a much better
           life. You spend your life
           believing that you have all the
           control over what happens.
           Bullshit. The plane you're flying
           goes down? Out of your control.
           God gives you cancer. I have no
           control over that. Did God give me
           cancer? You bet your ass God gave
           me cancer. You think if I begged
           for cancer God would have given it
           to me?56.No...because I assure you I have
           begged for God to take it away -

           wrong with you honey? You're
           beautiful, do you know that? Do I
           scare you? People either have to
           pretend they don't see me or
           they're drawn to me. It's funny
           because people see me as being
           close to the other side -- they
           feel like I have power or wisdom.
           They think I have the answers. Who
           knows? Maybe I do. Death gives
           you perspective. I lived my life
           so indecisive, in a haze. But now
           that I'm dying everything is so
           clear. It all makes sense somehow.

           had to hold on to our seat belts to
           keep from falling out of our chairs

           to local hospitals for treatment.
           Some of the injured appear serious
           and it's safe to assume at this
           point that there are at least a few
           fatalities. Let's roll the tape of

          Everyone looks to HUGH as it gets oddly silent... We get our
          first look at LEN CALDWELL, the president of the pilots'

          confidence.LEN CALDWELLEveryone in Georgia likes baseball.MR. CARRYeah...so what's the deal Lenny?
           Is your union gonna survive this
           one? More importantly? How big a
           check you think I'm gonna have to
           write?LEN CALDWELLThere were 6 fatalities on thePLANE-HUGH LANGThe 2 crew members don't get
           settlements like the passengers.
           That's a workman's comp claim, part
           of the union contract -- they do a
           dangerous job and they know it.MR. CARRYou're the lawyer for the pilots'
           union?LEN CALDWELLNo, this is Hugh Lang, the attorney
           we brought in to handle the
           criminal side of Captain Whitaker's
           situation.MR. CARRYes, and what is Mr. Whitaker's
           situation? NTSB is up my ass with
           a flashlight. We had to give them
           access to everything.87.(shakes his head)
           And everyone is curious about
           Captain Whitaker.

          Everyone steals glances at WHIP as CARR continues to
          dominate.MR. CARRIn a minute. Alright, so let's get
           down to it, Lenny. What does the
           union plan to do about this blood
           test that says Whitaker was high on
           booze and coke? This guy's a real
           peach.HUGHI'm gonna kill the toxicology
           report.
           (feels eyes of disbelief)
           It was done incompetently. The
           last time the toxicology equipment
           they used was calibrated was in
           June of 2009, which is 18 months
           past code. Their log that should
           clearly state who labeled the blood
           vials and when, is very incomplete.
           And they aren't sure who stored
           them. They used a preservative in
           the vials that has in some cases
           caused blood to ferment and
           register higher in an alcohol test.
           That's what I've done so far. I
           can handle this.MR. CARRI like this guy Lenny. He makes me
           wanna go out and sniff a few lines

           come sniffing in my other pockets.LEN CALDWELLSpeaking for the pilots' union? We
           don't want your airline to go away.
           We enjoy your contract with us and
           we will protect Captain Whitaker
           and in turn protect your airline.MR. CARRThat's sweet Mr. Caldwell, but if
           the NTSB leaks that toxicology
           report showing my pilot was flying

           We watch an 8 year-old WILL WHITAKER run long as the ball
           flies to him. He catches it and on-screen WHIP hollers.WHIP'S VOICE (CONT'D)Touchdown Whitaker! Atta boy!

           We pull away from the screen to find WHIP who sits on the
           couch. A large bottle of vodka appears empty amidst many
           dead beers and an ashtray that overflows.
                         
           WHIP moves in drunken slow motion as he attempts to free a
           cigarette from the pack and light it. He freezes at one
           point and places his hands straight out in front of himself,

           NICOLE watches as WHIP stands up. In his oblivion he tries

           itself out in slow, tragic fashion. WHIP motions to his lips
           as if he is smoking. He freezes and then steps forward and
           trips in to the coffee table. Whip falls to the ground.

           a blanket that she covers WHIP with. She also places a
           pillow under his head making sure that his head is titled to

          104 WHIP listens as CHARLIE talks... 104EXT. NTSB HANGAR -- RAINING -- DAYWHIP sits in his car. Rain pounds the windshield as we watch
           him expertly add vodka to a half-full bottle of orange juice.
           WHIP gives the bottle a shake before taking a long drink.
                         
           WHIP takes another drink before re-capping the bottle and
           stowing it in the glove box. WHIP gets out and we watch him
           walk in the rain towards the door of the hangar. A SECURITY
           GUARD meets him and takes him inside.INT. NTSB HANGAR -- THE REMAINS OF FLIGHT 227 - DAYWHIP is now alone in the huge, brightly lit hangar. He sees
           the plane.
                         
           The JR-88 has all of its pieces laying as close together as
           possible. Like the skeleton of a T-Rex in a museum. The
           sight is awesome, breathtaking. WHIP walks closer to the
           twisted wreck and stops. WHIP is overwhelmed by the sight
           and as he is about to leave...
                         
           CHARLIE steps out of the passenger door and calls down toWHIP.CHARLIEHere's our guy. C'mon.
                         
           WHIP walks towards a ramp that leads up to the hole in the
           plane where the door used to be. CHARLIE stands at the top
           of the ramp. Suddenly HUGH steps out of the plane...HUGHCaptain Whitaker, we've won.
                         
           WHIP doesn't move as HUGH starts down the ramp.HUGH (CONT'D)This is what we call in my
           profession a "walk over."CHARLIEThey've scheduled the hearing. It's
           in 10 days.
                         
           CHARLIE and HUGH reach the bottom of the ramp.112.HUGHBut these hearings can be tough.
           You just need to stay sharp and on
           course and answer the questions
           correctly. It's no longer a
           question of your condition but the
           condition of the plane.
                         
          This picks directly at the scab of WHIP's guilt.HUGH (CONT'D)I've had an "Act of God"
           successfully added to the list of
           probable causes.WHIPLook, it's simple. I flew a broken
           plane.CHARLIEYou got it. That's right.WHIPAnd what about my toxicology
           report?HUGH(trying to stay calm)
           I killed it. They have no physical
           proof that you were intoxicated on
           that plane. And no eye witness
           claims. But there's a problem.
                         
          This stops WHIP cold.HUGH (CONT'D)Because of the turbulence at the
           beginning of the flight and then
           the crash, there was never any
           drink service on the flight. But,
           they found two little vodka bottles
           in the galley trash bin. There was
           no physical evidence found on the
           bottles, no DNA, no finger prints.
           But both the bottles were uncapped
           and empty. The only people who had
           access to those bottles and could
           have drank them were the flight
           crew. Margaret, Evans and Camelia
           Satou all had clean tox reports.
           That leaves you and Trina Marquez.
                         
          They let that land. WHIP nods.113.WHIPOkay. I see...where this is going.
           That's funny that they found two
           bottles.HUGHWhy?WHIPBecause I drank three. One's
           missing.
                         
          HUGH explodes in frustration.HUGH LANGWhen I met you I couldn't believe
           what a flip, drunk, arrogant
           scumbag you were.WHIPFuck you too, Hugh.HUGH LANGBut I did the research and heard
           the analysis from the experts. I'm
           in awe of what you did.WHIPCan I go now?
                         
          HUGH gets big as he has to add the final piece of credence to
          the coronation.HUGH LANGTHE NTSB AND THE FAA TOOK 10EXPERIENCED PILOTS AND PLACED THEMIN SIMULATORS. THEY RECREATED ALLOF THE EVENTS THAT LED TO THISPLANE FALLING OUT OF THE SKY!HUGH is so loud and emotional even WHIP lends focus.HUGH LANG (CONT'D)Do you know how many were able to
           safely land these broken planes?
                         
          Everyone waits for the response as HUGH acknowledges the
          debris around them...HUGH LANG (CONT'D)Not one. Every pilot crashed and
           killed everyone on board.114.WHIPYeah. So?HUGHYou have no capacity to accept the
           responsibility for the miracle you
           performed and the lives you saved.WHIPGreat. I'm going home.
                         
          WHIP pulls out his cigarettes and frees a smoke from the
          pack.HUGH LANGDo you want to go to prison? I'm
           trying to save your life!
                         
          CHARLIE steps between them as this exchange spirals.WHIPWhat fucking life?! Don't kill
           yourself on my account, Hugh.
                         
          WHIP starts to walk away.HUGHOkay, I'm done here. I'm running
           out a faith that this guy's gonna
           make it, Charlie.WHIP(turns on Hugh)
           You wanna talk about me like I'm
           not here? Like I'm fucking dead?HUGH(to Whip now)
           This NTSB hearing is a Federal
           Agency Hearing. Do you understand
           that? It's in 10 days and if I
           show up with you like this?!
                         
          WHIP turns and walks. HUGH wheels on CHARLIE and lights him
          up.HUGH (CONT'D)Everything we've done? Everything
           I've done? Goes out the window.
           That's not on me. I did my job.
           It's your job, Charlie, to get him
           straight and get him to the church
           on time.115.WHIPYeah Charlie just get him home.
           Sober him up long enough to save
           the union's contract and that fat
           fuck's airline. Fuck you. I
           shoulda died on that plane.

           shiny floor of the hangar and into the growing rain storm.EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE THE WHITAKER FARM -- DAYThe rain has subsided as WHIP pulls up to his driveway.

           his house. He makes a U-turn and speeds away.EXT. NICE MODEST SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD -- DAYThe rain has completely stopped but everything remains wet as

          The two respectfully nod. HUGH leaves and the door shuts
          behind him. WHIP puts the folder on the table and steps to
          the mini-bar. He bends down and opens the fridge...
                         
          WHIP sees the fridge is overly stocked with soda and juices.
          Every soft drink you can imagine. No booze, anywhere. WHIP
          chuckles about the alcohol removal as he grabs a coke.

          WHIP lies on the bed. He sighs, sleep is alluding him and
          the anxiety of tomorrow's events on no sleep has his head
          spinning. He hears a metallic click. He stays quiet to
          listen for it...there it is again. An annoying click.
                         
          The clock reads "3:43"--
                         
          He sits up and switches on the LIGHT. He rubs his eyes and
          goes to the table and sees the file folder laying there. As
          he is about to pick it up he hears the metallic click again.
          He goes to investigate.HOTEL ROOM CONNECTING DOOR -- SAME TIMEThe connecting door is unlocked. WHIP arrives and waits. He
          now watches as the connecting lock-bolt CLICKS against the
          frame -- the door swinging in a draft. He looks up to see
          the culprit -- a heating vent. WHIP flips the vent closed.

          WHIP walks quietly on the carpet towards the window. The
          night is clear. Quiet. Whip takes in the city lights.WHIP'S POV --Among the glass and steel office buildings, Whip spots a
          church spire. A simple cross is perched on top.
                         
          Whip looks at the church, deep in thought.
                         
          Then suddenly...

          WHIP turns from the window and scans the room...
                         
          It's the MINI-BAR refrigerator -- HUMMING to life.126.Whip stares at the gleaming black box. The WHIR of the motor
          seems to get LOUDER. Calling Whip. Beckoning him...
                         
          Whip looks at the fridge. His face is blank, His eyes tell us
          nothing. Then...
                         
          Whip steps toward the box.

          WHIP stares at the "glimmering gems" for a long, long time --
          vodka, gin, wine, bourbon. The bottles SHIMMER -- AMBER,CRYSTAL, EMERALD, RUBY.WHIP reaches for a frosted vodka mini bottle -- he gently
          pinches the neck of the bottle and lifts it out of the
          fridge. He holds up the mini vodka and considers it.
                         
          Now Whip slowly removes the stopper and smells the White
          Whiskey. He looks at the bottle once more, then slowly twists
          the tiny cap back on.
                         
          With a look of solemn resignation, Whip places the frosted
          mini bottle on top of the fridge and walks away.
                         
          WE STAY CLOSE ON THE BOTTLE. The CAMERA FOCUSES on the small
          bottle as a small droplet of condensation runs down its side

          piles and lines. He has a system.

          Using the mirror as a tray, HARLING holds the rolled up 20
          dollar bill just above the line of coke. WHIP slowly manages
          to place his face in position to ingest the coke. It's tense
          as his head wobbles. He finally zeroes in and snorts the
          first line. HARLING quickly switches nostrils. WHIP sniffs
          the other side.HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)Atta boy, head back now. Swallow.

          mouth and hoovers up a small pile, sucking the coke through
          the cigarette.133.HARLING sits up, careful to keep the cocaine in the end of

           the train comin' to you.

          cigarette to WHIP. WHIP is more nimble now as he cocks his
          head in acceptance of the cigarette. WHIP takes a drag and

           just before we see WHIP step out of the hotel room and begin
           a relatively steady strut down the hallway. Deja Vu.
           Sunglasses on, WHIP is backed by HUGH and CHARLIE who flank
           him from a few steps behind. Further back we can see that
           OFFICER EDWARDS also exits the room wearing latex gloves,

           recall."
                         
          WHIP wheels on CHARLIE and unloads with focused anger...WHIPDo not tell me how to lie about my
           drinking. I've been lying about my
           drinking my whole life.
                         
          As we disappear in to WHIP's weary eyes we hear the
          distinctive sound of a jetliner screaming through the air.INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL - BALL ROOM - NTSB HEARING-DAYOn TWO LARGE SCREENS we watch the grainy cell phone footage
          shot by a witness of SOUTHJET FLIGHT 227's final moments in
          the sky. ACCOMPANYING the Video is the REAL AUDIO of the
          cockpit voice recording...
                         
          The room has a dais where the NTSB board members sit. A
          large blue curtain is the backing for the round NTSB shield
          that hangs above the proceedings. A large drop down screen
          will show images, graph and text as needed by the NTSB.
                         
          A confident woman, ELLEN BLOCK, approaches carrying a file
          which she lays on the podium.ELLEN BLOCKThose are difficult images to
           watch. For the record, I'm Ellen
           Block, Hearing Officer for this
           hearing. Captain Whitaker, good
           morning.136.We see WHIP who looks rough but stable in his witness chair.WHIPMorning.ELLEN BLOCKWhat was captured on that video is
           that the aircraft was in a
           relatively stable glide just prior
           to the moment of impact.
           However, according to the data we
           retrieved from the cockpit data
           recorders, at exactly 9:34, after
           flying 27 minutes without incident,
           the transponder recorded a loss in
           altitude in excess of 4800 feet per
           minute in what is considered a
           "full pitch nose down" attitude.
           Then at 9:42, according to the data
           recorders, a decision was made to
           invert the aircraft. The NTSB has
           created animated simulation that I
           would like to play at this point.
                         
          ELLEN points to the screen...
                         
          An NTSB animation shows the plane pitching down and we follow
          it through the inversion of the plane while listening to the
          real audio of the flight crew.
                         
          The animation has a split screen that also shows the
          instruments and printed text of what's being said.
                         
          We hear..."What's your son's name?" "Why?" "The black box"
          "I love you, Trevor. Be a good boy, Mommy loves you." "What
          are we doing?! Why would I trim down?!" "We're gonna roll
          it. Ready? Here we go. I've got control."
                         
          That last statement seems to echo as the presentation stops
          and the lights come back up. We return to the hearing in
          progress.ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)That audio is tragic and
           compelling. I chose to play that
           part of the cockpit recording to
           highlight a key moment aboard
           flight 227, wherein you say "We're
           gonna roll it, here we go, I've got
           control." You made a very
           conscious decision to invert the
           airplane, to roll the plane upside
           down. Is that correct?137.WHIPI'm not sure it was conscious. It
           was more of an instinct.ELLEN BLOCKWhat led to that decision?
                         
          WHIP is clearly struggling in his chair. The coke got him
          there but it may start to fail him soon.WHIPI don't recall.ELLEN BLOCKLet me quote from an investigative
           summary..."From 9:34 until 9:42 the
           events on the aircraft are"...again
           I quote, "bold and remarkable"...
           "By inverting the plane, Captain
           Whitaker arrested the descent and
           allowed the aircraft to level off
           enabling him to glide the aircraft
           away from any populated areas and
           allowing him to execute a forced
           landing in an open field.
                         
          We hear a smattering of applause as the facts of his actions
          are remarkable.WHIPI heard a metallic bang. We
           pitched nose down. No control.
                         
          WHIP looks ashen as the booze and chemicals are still
          coursing through his exhausted frame.ELLEN BLOCKYou had no idea what was wrong with
           the aircraft?WHIPThere was a lot of things wrong
           with that aircraft.
                         
          WHIP glances towards HUGH and CHARLIE who are poker-faced.ELLEN BLOCKAs I said before you can add any
           details you like to any comments I
           make. Do you remember any thing
           else that was out of the ordinary?
           Did you feel the flight crew was in
           their best shape?138.WHIP takes a minute to digest this question.WHIPYes.ELLEN BLOCKIt was raining very hard the
           morning you took off, wasn't it?WHIPThere was some convective activity
           in the area. However, my first
           officer and I discussed the
           conditions on the field and
           determined that we were safely
           within our visibility and crosswind
           minimums.ELLEN BLOCKYes, first officer Evans' testimony
           confirms the same.
                         
          WHIP goes quiet as ELLEN BLOCK looks at him over her glasses,
          seeing if he has any reaction. WHIP smiles.ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)I want to show you something.
                         
          HUGH is frozen in a steely gaze; CHARLIE seems to hold his
          breath.ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)Nothing's happening.
                         
          ELLEN points her remote at the projector but it doesn't work.ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)This remote is not working.
           Apologies. I can do it manually.
                         
          She shrugs and heads down onto the stage closer to WHIP where
          she can advance the slides by touching the projector.
                         
          We now see a screen where a slide is showing a long metal
          screw the size of a trombone.ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)This is the jackscrew on the tail
           assembly which articulates the
           horizontal stabilizer--also known
           as the elevator. As you can see,
           the threads on this screw are
           almost entirely gone. "139.Substandard thread life" is how we
           reported it. This part was
           suggested as a maintenance
           replacement in January of 2010. It
           was never replaced.
                         
           This had 1200 additional hours of
           flight on it. It finally failed.AN ANIMATION SHOWS THE TAIL ASSEMBLY.We watch the elevator acting as a wing on the tail that goes
          up or down and makes a plane get lift or descend.ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)Our investigators have concluded
           that the jackscrew snapped and the
           elevator was frozen in a fixed
           position, locking the elevator in a
           down position which forced the
           plane into a dive. The loss of the
           elevator was, and I quote our
           report, a "catastrophic event, from
           which recovery was improbable and
           stable flight impossible."
                         
          Everyone goes quiet as those words resonate. ELLEN's tone
          changes as she understands how hard this is for some people
          to hear as they think of their loved ones spending their last
          living minutes on this earth in sheer terror.
                         
          It is deathly quiet in the ballroom. Even the PRESS are
          silent.ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)Again I quote..."From 9:34 until
           9:42 the piloting decisions made by
           Captain Whitaker were bold and
           remarkable. The fact that Captain
           Whitaker commanded that the
           aircraft stay inverted while
           descending to an extremely low
           altitude shows a miraculous
           intuition that in this instance
           saved 96 lives."
                         
          A genuine applause spreads from the hearing room. ELLEN
          BLOCK allows this moment to happen.
                         
          WHIP is fading, dazed and uncomfortable with the unexpected
          adulation. He stands up.WHIPI appreciate that.140.The room gets quiet as WHIP's demeanor seems terse.
                         
          WHIP stares at ELLEN, white with sweat and chemicals. We see
          HUGH grind his jaw as this line of questioning has him on
          tilt.ELLEN BLOCKMr. Whitaker, I want to talk about
           the days leading and hours leading
           up to the accident. But before I
           do, I want to remind you that you
           are under oath and any testimony
           that you give here today will be
           considered admissable in any
           subsequent hearings or criminal
           proceedings, do you understand what
           that means?
                         
          WHIP nods.ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)Captain Whitaker, for the record I
           need you to verbalize your answer.WHIPYes, I understand.ELLEN BLOCKOn the three days leading up to the
           day of the accident -- Tuesday,
           October 11th, Wednesday, October
           12th or Thursday, October 13th of
           2011 -- did you consume any alcohol
           or other intoxicating elements?
                         
          WHIP takes his time.WHIPNo. I did not.HUGH AND CHARLIESit stone faced in the second row feeling the relief of
          months of hard work.
                         
          ELLEN BLOCK continues with a rote posture...ELLEN BLOCKOn the morning of the accident,
           Friday, October 14th, did you
           consume any alcohol or ingest any
           chemicals or drugs that may have
           impaired your ability to perform
           your job?141.WHIPNo. I did not.
                         
          ELLEN wraps up this line of questions...ELLEN BLOCKMr. Whitaker, do you now or have
           you ever had a problem with alcohol
           dependency, alcoholism or drug
           addiction?
                         
          WHIP waits for her to look at him...this takes a while...WHIPNo.
                         
          HUGH maintains a poker face; CHARLIE appears relieved.
                         
          ELLEN sorts through her notes one last time.ELLEN BLOCKOkay, Mr. Whitaker, we're about
           done.
           (She refers to her notes)
           Due to the severe turbulence during
           the early part of the flight, you
           asked the flight crew to suspend
           the beverage service on the plane.
           Is that correct?WHIPYes. I suspended the drink
           service.ELLEN BLOCKAre you aware that our
           investigators found two single-
           service Vodka bottles in the galley
           trash bin?
                         
          Slides now show the TWO SMALL VODKA BOTTLES in evidence.WHIPYes.ELLEN BLOCKThere were 5 crew members on board
           the flight who would have had
           access to the beverage trolley.
           Less than an hour after the
           accident, blood was taken from each
           of the crew members. Yourself...142.A SOUTHJET CORPORATE PHOTO OF WHIP pops on to the large
          monitors. After ELLEN references a member of the flight
          crew, their photo pops on to the monitors...ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)First Officer Evans, flight

           and three of these tests came back

          Hugh smiles -- satisfied.ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)And one tested positive for
           alcohol. It registered a .17 blood
           alcohol level. Are you aware of
           that?WHIPI am now.ELLEN BLOCKMiss Marquez was not only a
           colleague, but you knew her outside
           of work? Correct?WHIPOutside of work? Not really.ELLEN BLOCKDid you know Miss Marquez had a
           drinking problem?WHIPNo. I did not.ELLEN BLOCKDid you ever see her drink to
           excess?WHIPNo. I did not.143.ELLEN BLOCKDid you know that she was twice
           treated for alcohol addiction? The
           last time was 16 months ago and
           paid for by SouthJet Airlines?WHIPNo. I did not.
                         
          A picture of Trina's beautiful smiling face FLASHES UP ON THEBIG SCREEN.ELLEN BLOCKIs it your opinion that Katerina
           Marquez drank the vodka on the

          WHIP smiles at the photo of TRINA as if she can see him. He
          then shakes his head to snap from the memory of her great
          spirit. He gets serious as he bears his look down on ELLEN.WHIPCan you repeat the question?ELLEN BLOCKYour opinion Captain. Is it your
           opinion that Katerina Marquez drank
           on that flight?
                         
          Whip shakes. He runs his trembling hand through his hair.WHIPI'm sorry. My what...ELLEN BLOCKSince her toxicology report is the
           only toxicology report that is
           admissable in this hearing, and she
           in fact tested positive for
           alcohol, is it your opinion that
           Katerina Marquez drank those 2
           bottles of vodka on the flight?

           hear you. What did you say?WHIPI SAID...God help me...144.A confused MUMBLE rises in the room. Whip's response
          flusters ELLEN for a moment, but she recovers quickly.ELLEN BLOCKYes, well. However, is it your
           opinion...

           plane.ELLEN BLOCKMr. Whitaker, in light of that
           remark, would you like to
           readdress...WHIPYou don't have to readdress
           anything. I DRANK THE VODKA!ELLEN BLOCKOn the three nights before the
           accident, October 11th-WHIPOn October 11th, 12th and 13th and
           14th I was intoxicated. I drank
           alcohol on all of those days. I
           drank to excess.
                         
          Chaos erupts further as REPORTERS outnumber SECURITY. Flash
          bulbs pop repeatedly and large lights are aimed at the fracas
          on stage as video is taken of the bizarre melee.ELLEN BLOCKMr. Whitaker, on the morning ofOCTOBER-WHIPI was drunk. I'm drunk right now,
           Miss Block...I'm drunk right...
           (Whip finally breaks down)
           I'm drunk now, because...
           Because I'm an alcoholic.
                         
          We have pushed into a tight shot on WHIP's face as the sound
          in the room fades away. We stay tight on WHIP's face as he
          lets the moments unfold.
                         
          Suddenly the noise cuts to silence. WHIP is looking at the
          assembly. WHIP wipes tears from his eyes. We hear WHIP's
          voice as the dialogue pre-laps the image of his face.WHIP (V.O.)That was it...I was done. It's as
           if I'd hit my life long limit for
           lies.
                         
          A new angle shows WHIP speaking these words...146.WHIPI could not tell one more lie. And
           maybe I'm a sucker. Because if I
           had just told one more lie? I could
           have walked away from that whole
           mess and kept my wings and my false
           sense of pride and most importantly
           I would have avoided being locked
           up here with all of you nice folks
           for the last 13 months.
                         
          We hear laughter as we pull out from WHIP to realize that he
          is in fact wearing a white penal jumpsuit and leading an AA
          meeting in a Federal Prison.WHIP (CONT'D)It looks like I will serve every
           day of the remaining 4 plus years
           of my sentence. And that's fair.
           I betrayed the public trust. I
           did. That's what the judge
           explained to me. I had betrayed
           the public trust. The FAA took my
           license. And that's fair. The
           chances of me flying again are slim
           to none. And I accept that.INT. MCRAE FEDERAL PENITENTIARY -- GEORGIA -- DAYA large room houses an AA meeting for about 50 inmates
          wearing white jumpsuits. WHIP continues his story.WHIPI've had time to think about all of
           it. Doing a lot of writing. I've
           written letters to each of the
           families that lost loved ones on my
           flight. Some were able to hear my
           apology, some never will.
           I've also apologized to all the
           people who tried to help me along
           the way, but I couldn't or wouldn't
           listen, like my wife, I mean my ex
           wife...
           (he gets emotional)
           ...and my son. Again, some were
           able to forgive me...some never
           will.(COLLECTS HIMSELF)But at least I'm sober, and I'm
           grateful for that.
                         
          Whip gives it to us straight...147.WHIP (CONT'D)And this is gonna sound really
           stupid coming from a man who's in

           my life...I'm free.
                         
          We hold close on WHIP's face as we hear the metallic clang of
          prison doors shutting. On the sound we cut to...INT. FEDERAL PENITENTIARY -- CELL -- DAYWe pan across the concrete cell wall, looking at a small,
          personal photo collage. We see a photo of NICOLE and SHEILA
          and a few other AA FOLKS surrounding WHIP who sits in front
          of a birthday cake in the common room of the prison. We see
          a photo of WHIP's DAD as an airman. We ultimately land on a
          photo of NICOLE. We recognize it as the photo WHIP took on
          the porch of the Whitaker Farm.
                         
          We pan down to find WHIP writing in a journal. A GUARD comes
          to the front of his cell.GUARDWhitaker, you got a visitor.
                         
          WHIP looks at the GUARD and nods before taking a last glance
          at the photo of NICOLE.EXT. FEDERAL PENITENTIARY -- GUEST YARD -- DAYWHIP sits at a lone picnic table in a fence-enclosed
          courtyard. He checks his watch and looks up.
                         
          WHIP stands and walks towards us, towards his visitor. As he
          gets closer we see a smile break across his face. A smile we
          haven't seen since he first saw NICOLE. We reverse to see...

           surprise. I haven't seen you-
                         
          WHIP chokes up. WILL nods. It's intense. WHIP motions to
          the table and they both sit. WILL pulls out a notebook.WILLCollege counselor thought I should
           come and interview you.WHIPGreat. An interview. Okay.WILLI'm writing essays for college
           applications.
                         
          WHIP studies him and laughs...WILL nods and tries to smile.WHIPListen Will, it means everything to
           me that you came here. You are an
           amazing kid and you deserve great

          WILL pulls out a small voice recorder and clicks it on...WILLThis essay. I have to do an essay
           called, "the most fascinating
           person I've never met."

          WHIP smiles...a great, familiar question. He begins to
          alternately laugh and sob as there is great relief in the
          promise of a connection with his son.
