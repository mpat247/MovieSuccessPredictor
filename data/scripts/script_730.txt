                           "... the magic is all around you.
                                  All the time.  Everywhere.
                                             In every thing.
                                 The trick... is to see it."IN BLACK...... the insistent, persistent, eight-to-the-bar beat of
BOOGIE-WOOGIE.  Hot, exciting, pulsating rhythm, ramping up.THEN...... in the blackness, falling s-l-o-w-l-y, tumbling
g-e-n-t-l-y, a picture-postcard:"GREETINGS FROM HOLLYWOOD!"Then another... and another, each one dropping through frame,
a gentle rain.

In these old postcards, Hollywood is a dream town where movie
stars glide out of big cars to press their hands-and-
footprints in the wet cement.

Another postcard:"I'M MEETING THE STARS AT HOLLYWOOD & VINE!"In this postcard myth, you'd toddle down to Hollywood and
Vine, bump into Bogie and Bacall, and join them for dinner at
the Brown Derby.  Or Ciro's.  Or the Coconut Grove...

More postcards.  Pictures of movie theaters, but not the ones
that you and I know today.  These are palaces.  Temples. 
Grauman's Chinese and Egyptian.  The Carthay Circle.  The
Paramount, the Million Dollar.  From a time when moviegoing
was a complete experience, not a trip to the local mall.  The
ushers were friendly and helpful and wore gold brocaded
jackets and guided you to your seat.  The popcorn was hot and
fresh and buttered with real butter, not 30-weight motor oil.CUT TO:THE PILE OF POSTCARDSa wild jumble.  Then, one LAST POSTCARD drops lazily on top
of the pile.  It's a view of Hollywood at night, a carpet of
lights under the yawning, protective smile of Mt. Lee's most
famous resident, the fully-lit HOLLYWOOD SIGN.  We PUSH INTOTHE PICTURE OF THE SIGN, DISSOLVING UNTIL WE'RE...... PUSHING INTO THE REAL HOLLYWOOD SIGN, closer and closer,
until we fly right through it -- then crazily loop up and
behind it until we're looking down at...EXT.  HOLLYWOOD (AERIAL VIEW) - NIGHTSUPER TITLE: 1951A gigantic aerial shot.  Postwar autos fill the muggy
midsummer evening air with the sounds of thousands of HONKING
HORNS, a mere precursor to the traffic yet to come.  Darkened
outlying neighborhoods are evidence of the postwar home
construction boom, as scores of stucco bungalows are being
built in the areas surrounding the beating heart of the town,
a swath of garishly bright concrete calledHOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD.PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)Of course, it's not like the
          postcards say it is.  This is what
          it's like.  I'm Pete Appleton, and
          this is my town.

Still in the same shot, we rocket down into the center of the
intersection of Hollywood and Vine, then head west along the
boulevard, skimming just above the traffic -- past Musso and
Frank's Grill and the Hollywood Canteen, past the Egyptian
Theater and a rumbling Pacific Electric Red Car, across
Highland Avenue, past the Paramount Theater, and across the
street toGRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER.PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)Born and raised here, thank you
          very much.  Sometimes, it seems
          like everyone here is from
          somewhere else.  But everyone loves
          the movies, so Hollywood is
          everyone's town, and they come here
          by the busload.  To them, Grauman's
          Chinese Theater is just about the
          most exciting place on the planet. 
          To me, it's the theater that's
          playing "The African Queen."

And like the man said, the film on the marquee is "THE
AFRICAN QUEEN."  Still the same shot, buses disgorge
TOURISTS, who move into the forecourt of the theater.  The
MEN doff their hats and mop their brows.  The WOMEN pull
their blouses away from their chests, fanning themselves with
movie-star maps as they marvel at the signed cement blocks. 
We MOVE AMONG THEM, until we pick up A COUPLE, and we stay
behind them as they work their way through the crowd, on
their way toTHE THEATER ENTRANCE,where an ornately attired DOORMAN smiles and tears their
tickets.DOORMANNewsreel's just starting, folks.PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)That's me and my girlfriend.  Her
          name is Sandra Sinclair, and this
          is her town, too -- she's from
          Cleveland.  She came out here to be
          an actress, and that's just what
          she's doing.  The first picture I
          ever wrote, a little potboiler
          called "Sand Pirates of the
          Sahara."  Okay, it ain't "Citizen
          Kane," but you gotta start
          somewhere.MOVING INTO THE LOBBYan explosion of glitz mixed with Chinese myth and legend. 
Everywhere you look, it's red and orange and plush carpeting
and golden light.  We MOVE THROUGH the lobby, still in the
same shot, still tracking the couple, heading for the
auditorium doors, which are swept open by two ramrod-erect
USHERS and we move intoTHE DARKENED THEATER.As the couple, Pete and Sandra, find seats, we HEAR the
soundtrack of the film before we see the screen, the
unmistakable strains of a march, and then -- still in the
same shot -- we see the screen...A NEWSREEL.As the march SWELLS to a crescendo, we HEAR THE NEWSREELANNOUNCER'S SONOROUS VOICE:NEWSREEL ANNOUNCERBringing the news of the world to
          you!

Over a newsreel shot of a packed Congressional Committee
Hearing Room, a title blares "HOLLYWOOD REDS GO TO JAIL!"NEWSREEL ANNOUNCERFour years ago, in one of
          filmland's darkest hours, ten men,
          the so-called "Hollywood Ten," were
          called to testify before the House
          Committee of Un-American
          Activities, investigating the
          proliferation of the dreaded Red
          Menace in Hollywood.

We see several shots of WITNESSES engaged in heated verbal
battles with congressmen, especially Committee Chairman T. 
JOHNSTON DOYLE and the Majority Counsel, ELVIN CLYDE.NEWSREEL ANNOUNCERRefusing to answer the lawmaker's
          questions, cowering behind the
          Fifth Amendment's protection
          against self-incrimination, the ten
          motion picture writers dared
          Congress to come after them.  Well,
          come after them they did!  And
          after years of court wrangling,
          it's now time to pay the piper!

Over shots of several of the "Hollywood Ten" being led to
jail in handcuffs, the newsreel narration continues.NEWSREEL ANNOUNCERAnd so, it's off to jail, the
          charge: Contempt of Congress!  This
          should give you fellas something to
          write about now!  A new round of
          investigations begins this fall,
          the mandate: Get the reds out of
          Hollywood!

In the audience, one man YELLS "Lock up the commie
bastards!," and a few others cheer and laugh.  As the
newsreel moves on to a somewhat more innocuous subject, weWHEEL AROUND AND...ENDFRAME ON PETE APPLETON AND SANDRA SINCLAIR.Pete's a handsome fellow in his 30s, and Sandra's a starlet
pretty girl in her mid-20s.  As she rummages in her purse,
Pete watches the newsreel.SANDRAPete, there's time before the
          picture starts, you want to get
          some popcorn?PETEYou bet, honey.

Pete kisses Sandra on the cheek, then stands and sprints up
the aisle to the concession stand, a big unworried grin on
his face.PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)We were young, we were in love, and
          we were working in pictures. 
          Life... was good.DISSOLVE TO:EXT.  UNITED PICTURES STUDIOS - MAIN GATE - MORNINGPete pulls up to the guard kiosk in his spiffy yellow
convertible Plymouth.  The Guard, RAY, steps out to meet him. 
Pete lights up a cigarette.  We get a better sense of him
now.  Though earnest, he's jocular, and a bit of a fast
talker.PETE(very chipper)
          Mornin', Ray.  Whaddya know whaddya
          say?  Me and Sandra caught "The
          African Queen" at the Chinese last
          night.  Great picture, great
          picture.

Ray is nonplussed.  Tips his hat.  Regards Pete suspiciously.RAYMr. Appleton.PETEWhat's with this "Mr. Appleton"
          crap?  Your boss hiding in there?RAYYou're clear to go in.PETEWhat's that mean?

Ray heads back to his kiosk, shaking his head.RAYHave a pleasant day.

Pete, covering his worry well, drives onto the lot.EXT.  UNITED PICTURES STUDIOS - WRITER'S BUILDING - MORNINGPete pulls up, hops out, grinds out his cigarette, looks
around and goes inside.INT.  WRITER'S BUILDING HALLWAY - MORNINGPete comes down the hall a few steps, stops.  Something's
wrong.  It's awfully quiet.  He pokes his head into the door
marked "TYPING POOL."INT.  TYPING POOL - MORNINGA sea of black Underwoods -- all silent.  The lights in the
room are off, and hard shafts of morning sun stream in
through the windows.  One typists, LOUISE, is going from
machine to machine, pulling covers over them.PETELouise... what gives?

She looks up, startled.LOUISEOh Pete... they, uh, they gave
          everybody the day off... while they
          sort things out.PETESort what out?  Are my pages done?LOUISEThey took 'em.PETEThey took 'em?  Who took 'em? 
          Louise, what's going on...LOUISEPete, I'm not even supposed to be
          talking to you...

She rushes past him.  Pete doesn't quite know what to think.MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)Good morning, Peter.

Pete turns.  The voice belongs to Pete's agent, LEO KUBELSKY,
a rotund man in his fifties.  He wears a perfectly tailored
silk suit.PETELeo... what's going on?CUT TO:EXT.  STUDIO STREET - DAYFROM FAR AWAY, we watch as Leo and Pete come out of the
Writer's Building and join a flood of DRESS EXTRAS, all done
up in Puritan pilgrim garb and heading for the commissary.

As they move through the mob and emerge on the other side,
it's clear that Pete is reeling from something he's just been
told.PETE AND LEOLEOPeter, their hands are tied.  You
          see that, don't you?PETEI... I don't believe this.LEOAre you saying it's a mistake, that
          you didn't go to any meetings? 
          They say you did.PETEWho the hell is this "they?"LEOCongress, the FBI, Red Channels, it
          don't matter who the hell "they"
          is.  "They" know who "they" are,
          that's all that matters.
              (deliberately)
          Now, did you go to any meetings?PETE(on the spot)
          No.  Yeah... I... I don't know. 
          Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before
          Pearl Harbor.  I was in college. 
          It was a bunch of kids, and I was
          just one of 'em.  I didn't believe
          in what they were saying.  Hell, I
          didn't even know what they were
          saying!LEOSo, you're saying that it's true. 
          You went to a meeting of a known
          communist organization.PETELeo, I was trying to impress a
          skirt.  You know me, I'm non-
          political.  Republican, Democrat,
          Communist, there's not a dime's
          worth of difference between 'em
          anyway.LEOYou should watch what you say.PETEI don't know who fingered me, but
          I'm not a communist!LEOKid, that cuts no ice with them.PETE(frustrated)
          What?  That I'm accused of being a
          communist when I don't happen to be
          one?LEOThey know you were at that meeting,
          Peter.  They've been told, and they
          know.PETELeo, you're my agent.  Tell "them"
          to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do
          anything wrong.  I fought in the
          war, for crissakes!LEOFought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the
          PX at Fort Dix.PETEI was decorated.LEOI know.  A Purple Heart.PETEExactly.LEOYou broke your arm.  You were
          coming out of a bar.  You were
          drunk.PETEAt least I was on our side!  Look,
          they want me to testify?  I'll
          testify.  I'll tell 'em anything
          they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo,
          this is my career!LEOYou can't testify.PETEWhy not?

Leo takes a gold cigarette care from his breast pocket,
offers a cigarette to Pete and takes one for himself.LEODon't take this personally, kid. 
          If it were up to me, I'd have you
          testify wearing your uniform and
          your medal, wrapped in a flag with
          one hand on your heart and the
          other hand on a bible.  What can I
          say?  I like you.

Leo lights Pete's cigarette and his own.  Puts a fatherly
hand on his shoulder.LEOThey don't want you to testify
          because you're not a big enough
          fish for them.  They just don't
          want you writing pictures for now. 
          That's all.PETE(under his breath)
          Yeah, well, that's enough.LEOPeter, I believe in you.  More to
          the point, I read your new
          script... um...PETE"Ashes To Ashes?"LEOThat's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." 
          I think it's great.  But it'll
          never get made with this communist
          business hanging over your head. 
          You can't work until you're cleared
          -- and believe me, starting right
          now, I'm gonna do everything I can
          to make that happen.PETESo, it is a blacklist.LEO(defensive)
          Don't say that.  There is no such
          thing as a blacklist.
              (calm)
          Now, are you gonna play ball?PETE(sullenly)
          Yes.
              (then, pissed)
          Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!

Leo blows out a thin stream of smoke.LEO(hand on Pete's shoulder)
          Kid, this is the United States
          Government we're talkin' about. 
          Fair ain't the point.CUT TO:INT.  WRITER'S BUILDING/PETE'S OFFICE - DAYProminent on the wall is a framed "SAND PIRATES OF THE
SAHARA" poster.  Pete reaches up and takes it down.  He leans
it up against the desk, then sits heavily in the wooden
swivel chair.  He swivels around to seeA STUDIO SECURITY GUARDstanding by the door.  He's watching Pete's every move.

Two boxes sit on the desk, partially packed with Pete's
belongings.  Pete lights a cigarette and opens the lower desk
drawer.  He pulls out a stack of scripts and sets them on the
desk.  He looks at the cover of the first one:"SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA"By Peter Appleton
                A United Pictures Production
                     February 19, 1951

Pete shuffles the scripts and looks at the cover of the
second one:"ASHES TO ASHES"By Peter Appleton

He jams the scripts into one box and turns to the other box,
which contains somewhat more personal items.  A ragged gold
pillow with tassels.  Legal pads of notes.  An old tin-toy
fire truck, its bright red paint chipped and worn.  He turns
it around in his hands.PETE(musing)
          Huh.  Red...

Footsteps approach, and Pete swivels toward the door.SANDRA (O.S.)Pete?  Pete...?

Sandra appears in the doorway.  She's in costume -- a Louis
XIV courtier.  She bustles past the Guard, rushes to Pete and
embraces him.SANDRAOh, Pete...

They kiss.  The Guard watches their every move.SANDRAWhat happened?PETEWhat exactly did you hear?SANDRAThat you got let go.PETEI wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie
          Ruskin directing the picture you're
          in?SANDRAHe was, but he got sick.  We got a
          new director today.  Why?PETEWell, whatever Frankie's got, it's
          catching.SANDRAYou mean, he was... let go, too?PETE(sotto, an appeal)
          They're saying I'm a communist,
          Sandy.  But I'm not, you know that. 
          I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna
          win, but I'll need your help.

During this last, Sandra has been ever-so-slightly pulling
away from Pete.PETEA lot of good people are being
          accused of things they didn't do. 
          Hell, even if I was a communist,
          this is America, goddammit, a
          person should be able to be
          whatever they want to be!  Right?

Sandra glances at the Guard, who is watching everything.SANDRA(nervously)
          Of course, but I... I don't know
          how I... how much help I can be to
          you.  This is the sort of thing...
          someone saying you're a
          communist... it can ruin your
          career.

Pete sees where this is going.  She's edging toward the door.PETEWill you help me, Sandy?SANDRAI'll have to think about this.  I
          have to get back... I should go...

And she's out the door and gone in the blink of an eye.  Pete
looks at the Guard.PETESo nice to be a pariah.

The Guard turns away.  Pete moves back toward the boxes. 
Rummaging again, he comes up with a bottle of Jack Daniels
with barely one swig left.  He regards the bottle for a
moment, looks to see if the Guard is watching (he isn't),
pops the cork, puts it to his lips and drains it.  He looks
at it thoughtfully as weCUT TO:A HALF-FULL BOTTLE OF JACK DANIELS setting down on a bartop.WIDERINT.  THE FROLIC ROOM - NIGHTThe bottle is in front of Pete, who sits at the bar, quietly
getting stewed.  The Frolic Room is a classic Hollywood dive,
dimly lit and full of character and characters.  It's a quiet
night and getting quieter, as several PATRONS are just
leaving, waving goodbye to the bartender, JERRY, early 40s. 
Jerry turns to Pete, eyes him suspiciously from the end of
the bar.  Pete picks up the bottle and pours another shot. 
Good boy, he got most of it in the glass.JERRYPete.  You think maybe you've had
          enough?PETEBought the bottle, didn't I?
              (raises the shot)
          To the United States of America. 
          Long my she wave.

He knocks it back and Jerry pours him another.PETE(trying to light a smoke)
          Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.JERRYWhat.PETEYou tight with J. Edgar Hoover?JERRY(helps Pete light his
               cigarette)
          The G-man?PETE(thickly)
          Zackly.JERRYPete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in
          here wearing a dress, I wouldn't
          know him.PETEToo bad.  He says I'm a communist.JERRY(glancing around)
          You should watch what you say.  You
          don't know who's listening.PETEYou know I'm not a communist, don't
          you, Jer?JERRYSure, I suppose.  That why you're
          on a bender?PETEThis is not a bender yet.  This is
          the start of a bender.  But I can
          see how you were confused, they
          look a lot alike.

Pete drains his shotglass, puts it back on the bar.  He
watches Jerry, who is not about to refill it.  Pete reaches
for the bottle, but Jerry is faster.JERRYPete... go home.  Come on, I'll
          call that girlfriend of yours,
          what's her name... Sandy?PETE(laughs)
          Sandra Sinclair.JERRYGimmee her number, I'll have her
          pick you up.PETESandra Sinclair.  Wanna know her
          real name?  Bella Iskowitz.  No
          one's who they really are, Jer. 
          Everyone's someone else.  Even you. 
          Even me.  Especially me.  I'm Peter
          Appleton, the communist who's not
          really a communist.JERRYI wanna close up soon.  C'mon,
          let's call her.

Peter stands, stubs out his smoke, drops a few crumpled bills
on the bar and grabs his hat.PETENope.  Can't.  We're through.JERRYThen I'll call you a cab.PETEI'll save you the trouble.
              (beat)
          I'm a cab.  There.  Did it myself.

Pete's preoccupied with putting on his hat and getting his
car keys out of his coat pocket, a daunting task in his
condition.PETE'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll
          be seein' ya, Jer.JERRYPete...

And he's out the door.EXT.  FROLIC ROOM - NIGHTPete takes a few steps, stumbles, stops, takes a deep breath,
then totters briskly towards his car.  He hauls the door open
and sits inside heavily.INT./ EXT.  PETE'S CAR - NIGHTSitting slumped against the steering wheel, Pete looks as
though he could fall asleep right there, which would probably
be a good idea.PETE(mumbling)
          Drive.  Drive.  Bad idea.  Too
          drunk to drive.

He looks at his watch.PETEOne-thirty.  Huh!  Early.  Can't go
          home yet.

He turns the key and hits the starter.  The engine hums to
life.  Pete sits up, opens his eyes wide, shakes off the haze
and puts the car in gear.

The Plymouth lurches forward a few yards, screeches to a halt
and stalls.PETEOops.

He re-starts the car, puts it in gear, and pulls away and
down the deserted boulevard.DISSOLVE TO:EXT.  SANTA MONICA BEACH, AMUSEMENT PIER - NIGHTThe full moon is low over the ocean.  Pete's car is parked at
the edge of the sand, the water fifty yards away.  The ferris
wheel and the roller coaster of the amusement pier are dark
and eerie silhouettes, lit only by moonlight.  Pete is asleep
in the driver's seat, head tilted back, his hat covering his
face, snoring.

The waves CRASH against the pilings and startle Pete awake.PETEHuh?  Whatsa...

Instantly, he grabs his head.PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)I had no idea how I got to Santa
          Monica, but it certainly was a good
          idea.  I don't think I could've
          faced the headache I had alone in
          my apartment.  At least I had the
          ocean air.

Pete takes a deep breath... and starts coughing.  He gets out
his cigarettes and lights up.  He takes a puff and glances at
his watch.PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)Three forty-five.  I had only been

          Can't wait.CUT TO:INT.  BIJOU LOBBY - DAYThe interior of the theater fulfills every promise made by
the exterior.  Moth-eaten velvet-flocked wallpaper hangs in
shards and pieces from the walls.  It's sort of a cross
between a gaudy cathouse and a mausoleum, served up with
generous helpings of dust and grime, an almost unbeatable
combination of questionable taste and neglect.

Above the center of the lobby hangs what was -- and is --
probably the only truly beautiful item in the whole
theater --A DELICATE CRYSTAL CHANDELIER.Even under a veneer of dust, the fragile droplets of cut
crystal seem to pick up every available point of light and
scatter it in a hundred directions.TILT DOWN TO REVEALLuke and Harry standing below.  Luke is lost in a gulf
somewhere between surprise and disgust.HARRYWe've been closed for a while.LUKE(smiling wanly)

Luke walks toward the auditorium doors and slowly, cracks one
open.INT.  AUDITORIUM - DAYThe ocean of two hundred or so seats on the main floor seem
to be, for the most part, intact -- although the occasional
row seems to have loosed itself from its moorings and heaved
itself up against the row behind or in front.THE SCREENis really not much more than a tatty bit of yellowing muslin,
framed by ragged red velveteen drapery.

In the tiny orchestra pit, as we will see later, is an old
upright piano.

Luke walks a few steps down the aisle.  He picks a seat on
the aisle near the middle of the theater and sits.  As he
does, a CAT, an orange tabby, leaps out from under another
seat, jets past Luke and disappears down the aisle and
backstage.  Harry comes over and sits behind him.LUKE(turning to Harry)
          Exactly how long has the Bijou been
          closed?HARRYHmmmm... after you left, it was
          difficult, and then Lily -- that's
          your mother -- she took ill and
          died... we haven't shown a picture
          since forty-eight.LUKEWhy?HARRY(deep breath)
          Well, after the war, with so many
          of the town's boys killed, people
          around here didn't much feel like
          going to the movies, I guess.  Some
          of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles,
          Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't
          much to keep 'em here, I expect.

          C'mon, I'll show you where we live.CUT TO:INT.  BIJOU APARTMENT - DAYThe small apartment above the projection booth is quite a
contrast to the rest of the theater.  It's neat as a pin, and
fairly lit, as Harry has just pulled back the curtains,
allowing the sun to flood the room.

A beam of golden light falls across a table, atop which areSEVERAL FRAMED PHOTOS.One of the photos is of the real, much-younger Luke.  It's a
Norman Rockwell scene, at a train depot, with an army-issue
olive drab duffel bag slung over his shoulder.  He has one
arm around Harry and the other around his mother.

(And by the way, Pete's resemblance to the real Luke -- even
in a nearly 10 year old photo -- is pretty damn startling...)HARRYThe day you shipped out.  That was
          a proud day for your mother and me. 
          Last time you saw her.  Last time I
          saw you.

He smiles.HARRYTill today.

Luke sets it down and picks up another photo, that of a fine
looking woman.  It's a formal portrait, dating perhaps from
the 30's.HARRYThat's Lily.  Your mother, rest her
          soul.LUKE(repeating)

          certainly made this place a home.

He takes the picture from Luke, kisses it, and gently
replaces it on the table.  Luke goes over to the sofa and
sits.HARRY(brightly)

          some coffee on or some...

Harry looks at Luke, who has almost instantly fallen asleep

Luke rolls over on his back, still asleep, snoring lightly. 
Slowly, he starts to wake up, eyes still closed.

Something's strange, though.  He frowns.  The train is
GETTING CLOSER.  Luke's eyes POP OPEN.LUKE'S POVAs the train RUMBLES BY, shaking everything in the room, Luke
looks up to see three ancient cherubs staring down at him.

Luke sits up on the sofa and tries to get a little more
awake.  He rubs the side of his head that is still bandaged. 
The elderly woman nudges Harry gently.HARRYOh, I'm sorry, they know you, but
          you don't... you need to be re-
          introduced.  Luke, this is Mrs.

OLT TIM is -- well, old.  His clothes are a tad shabby, but
well maintained, though they hang loosely on his gangly

removes as he shakes Luke's hand.  He's a man of few words,

          No, you are.  I know exactly what
          you mean.  It's not that you're

          They're not bad.ADELENo, they're not.  I'd say your
          investment was paying dividends.LUKEMy what?ADELEBack in '37, you heard Benny
          Goodman play for the first time, so
          you went out and got a used
          clarinet.  You wanted nothing more
          than to be able to play like him. 
          You tried hard, but it wasn't long
          before it was clear that Benny
          Goodman would never be looking over
          his shoulder.  So you gave the
          clarinet to Spencer.LUKEHuh.  That was nice of me.ADELEYou had a hidden agenda, though. 
          See, when he was five or six,
          little Spence used to follow you
          around like a puppy.  Bothered the

Luke dances Adele away, a slightly nonplussed expression on
her face.  The band finishes the song, and everyone
enthusiastically APPLAUDS.  Spencer bows shyly, blushing
slightly.  He nods to the band, and they bow before he
motions for the crowd's attention.SPENCER(nervously)

He holds up the clarinet and scans the crowd until he sees
Luke.SPENCER(to Luke)

APPLAUSE again, and Ernie waits for it to settle.  As soon as
he starts speaking, the crowd becomes totally silent.ERNIEYou know folks, here in Lawson, we
          gave a lot for our country.  A lot. 
          And we never complained and we
          never faltered.  And we never
          forgot.

Ernie's voice cracks slightly with emotion.  He clears his
throat and continues.ERNIEWe never forgot.  And so when one
          of our own came back to us, I gotta
          tell you folks, it was like a

Ernie wipes his eyes and changes the subject.ERNIEAll right, enough a'that.  This is
          a celebration, so let's have us a

and Cat shoots into the lobby, disappearing into the
auditorium.  Luke closes the door... and stops.  He HEARS
something, and so do we.  Soft and faraway, it's a PIANO. 
The melody is soft, lilting -- almost a lullaby.

Luke turns toward the music, which is coming from the
auditorium.  The piano continues, building slightly in
volume.  He moves to the auditorium doors and tentatively
pushes one open.INT.  AUDITORIUM - NIGHTLuke enters, his face bathed in the soft, flickering,

booth.  We come out of the beam and can just barely make out
the figure of Harry, framed in a small window next to the
projector.

WE CONTINUE PUSHING IN -- closer and closer -- until Harry's
face fills the screen.  He is watching the film; his eyes are
wide and moist, as though he's experiencing the magic that's
unfolding on the screen for the very first time.

The warning bell on the projector CHIMES THREE TIMES,
signaling the end of the reel.  Harry moves away from the
window.INT.  PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHTNever taking his eyes off the screen, Harry watches as the
film comes to an end and flap!  falp!  falps!  out of the
projector.  He kills the motor and cranks the carbon arcs
apart, and the bright beam dies.  It's not the end of the
movie, but it is the end of the only fragment they have.

Harry moves to the house lights rheostat, and slowly fades
them up.  This done, he pulls a handkerchief from his back
pocket and blows his nose loudly.

He crosses back to the projector, unlatches the full take-up
reel and takes it down.  He's about to move away, when he
senses that he's not alone.  He looks over the projector to
seeLUKE,standing there.  Their eyes meet.  Someone should say
something -- both men search for words.  Suddenly, Luke feels
very out-of-place, almost embarrassed -- as though he's
interrupted a very private ritual.

Harry senses this.  Clutching the precious reel of film
tightly to his chest, he searches Luke's face and smiles
warmly.HARRYBeautiful, wasn't it?LUKE(softly)
          Yes.HARRYWell, son, I wish I could've shown
          you more, but this is all that's

Father and son look at each other for a long moment --
searching each other's eyes.  Harry smiles a sort-of half-
smile at Luke, and, still clutching the reel, crosses to the
rewind bench.  Methodically, he mounts it and threads the end
of the film onto an empty reel.  Slowly, he begins to turn
the crank, rewinding the film.

But it's clear Luke has no idea what he's doing.  He's just
plunking bass notes.  But after a moment, the bass figures
he's improvising start to change -- and before long, it's
transformed into the eight-to-the-bar figure of a boogie
woogie beat.  Mrs. Terwilliger stops playing, annoyed.MRS. TERWILLIGERReally, Luke!  That's no way to
          treat Mr. Chopin!

          committee what was the nature and
          purpose of the "Bread Instead of
          Bullets Club?"PETEMr. Clyde, do you want to know what
          I knew then, or do you want to know
          what I know now?  They're two
          different things?CLYDEStart with what you knew then.PETEWell, I'd direct the attention of
          counsel and committee to line
          thirty-six of the document, and the
          name printed and signed there.CLYDEWe see it.  For the record, it
          reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's
          the point of this?PETEWell, that's what I knew then.  Or
          who I knew, I should say.  You see,
          I was trying to court Miss
          Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to
          impress her.CLYDE(grinning)
          Are you asking this committee to
          believe that you attended a meeting
          of a communist party front

The audience LAUGHS.  Doyle BANGS his gavel.PETEYou asked for the truth.  That's
          the truth.  I had no idea what the
          meeting was about.  I just sat
          through it so I could be near her. 
          I'm sure even a Majority Counsel
          like yourself is familiar with the
          concept of impressing a girl.

his gavel.DOYLEChamber will come to order.

Clyde shuffles some papers and looks back at Pete.CLYDEAll right, Mr. Appleton.  That was
          what you knew then.  What do you
          know now?PETE(takes a deep breath)
          Well, I know that I lost my job
          because of one meeting I went to
          when I was a kid in college.  I
          know that I've been branded a
          communist, which I'm not, but even
          if I was, it shouldn't matter, or
          what do we have a Bill Of Rights
          for?CLYDEMr. Chairman, the witness is being

          You earlier testified that you
          attended a meeting of a communist
          party-run organization, yet you
          just said, under oath, that you
          were not now -- nor ever -- a
          member of the communist party.PETEThat's not a contradiction at all,
          sir.  I went to the meeting, but I

          the Fifth Amendment pertains to
          self-incrimination, and I can't
          incriminate myself because I've
          done nothing wrong.  Besides,
          incrimination is why you have Mr.

          is your intention?

Pete's sweating under the lights.  He's bluffed his last
bluff, and he's on the ropes.  He reaches into his pocket...
and takes out the prepared statement.INT.  LARDNER LIVING ROOM - DAYPETE (ON TV)I... Mr. Chairman, I have a

He stops suddenly.  Pause.DOYLEMr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?PETEI... I need a drink of water.DOYLEGo ahead, son.

Pete fills a glass from the pitcher.  Nervously, he spills a
bit, and is splashes onto his coat.  As some of the
spectators chuckle, Pete brushes the water off.  He reaches
into his pocket, and pulls out Adele's copy of the
constitution.  The cover is wet.  He wipes it off and sets it
down on the table.

He takes a sip of water.  Looks at the book.  Picks it up.

Pete's terrified, but in control.  He speaks slowly -- he's
making this up and thinking it out as he goes.PETEMr. Chairman... there's... another
          Amendment... that I'd like to
          invoke at this time, but it's not
          the Fifth Amendment.  I wonder if
          you're familiar with it.DOYLEMr. Appleton, you will...

He opens the book and reads, tentatively at first.PETE"Congress shall make no law
          respecting an establishment of
          religion, or prohibiting the free
          exercise thereof; or abridging the

          and good and just -- if only we'd
          live up to that potential.  It's
          what gives me the right to sit in
          this chair and say my piece before
          this committee without fear.  It's
          the most important part of the
          contract that every citizen has
          with this country.  And even though
          this contract...

And with that, Pete closes the book, picks up the prepared
statement, rips it up, pushes back his chair, stands and
walks toward the door.  The cameras swing with him, and
FLASHBULBS fire like machine guns.  Doyle BANGS his gavel

his pocket and withdraws a gold cigarette case, which he
opens and offers to Pete.LEOCigarette?PETENo thanks.
