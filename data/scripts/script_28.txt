     missionary position sex, little passion.  They slow to a

     the edge of the bed.  Amy covers herself.AMYI love you.WELLESI love you.

                 my daughter, but what can you do?

     waves.  Welles waves, resumes mowing.INT.  BOWLING ALLEY -- NIGHTMUSIC'S LOUD.  League Night.  Every lane full.  Welles is

     Down the lane, PINS SCATTER.  One pin remains standing.

     rowdy, mocking teammates.  He shouts back at them, laughing,
     grabbing his beer and drinking, waiting at the ball return.INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHTDinner.  Welles and Amy eat at the kitchen table with Cindy

     Welles nods, eating.  He watches Amy feed Cindy.  The PHONE
     starts RINGING.  Welles goes to answer it.WELLES(into PHONE) 
                 Hello.  Yes... could you hold on a
                 minute...?

     downstairs, through the LIVING ROOM...INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, OFFICE -- NIGHTWelles enters his well kept OFFICE, turns on a light at the
     desk.  The room is filled with FILE CABINETS and shelves of

                 Hello... sorry, I was switching
                 phones.  It's a pleasure to make
                 your acquaintance, Mrs. Christian.

                 Yes.  Yes, I understand... tomorrow
                 evening should be fine...

     Welles listens, clears space on his desk, taking notes.EXT.  CHRISTIAN COMPOUND -- DUSKA huge OLD WORLD MANSION is situated at the center of acres
     of Pennsylvania forest and vast gardens.  Welles' car heads
     down a long tree lined drive, to the dark mansion.INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, HALLWAY -- NIGHTWelles follows a BUTLER down a long hall.INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, LIBRARY -- NIGHTThe butler shows Welles in, shuts the door.
     Towering SHELVES of BOOKS are serviced by ladders.  Far
     across the room, an old, sad woman, MRS. CHRISTIAN, sits
     waiting with a tall, thin, sinister ghoul of a LAWYER.MRS CHRISTIANMister Welles. You're very prompt.WELLESI try to be.

     Welles crosses towards them. It takes a while.MRS CHRISTIANI appreciate your coming on such
                 short notice. 

     Mrs. Christian holds out her hand and Welles takes it.MRS CHRISTIANThis is Mister Longdale, my late
                 husband's attorney. 

     Welles shakes Longdale's limp hand, looking him over.WELLESUh huh, pleasure.MRS CHRISTIANApparently Mr. Longdale has
                 something he feels he simply must
                 say before you and I speak.LONGDALEYes, I do have something to say.  I
                 insisted on being here as soon as I
                 heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.WELLESI'm listening.LONGDALEAs Mr. Christian's attorney and one
                 of the executors of his estate, it
                 concerns me that a meeting of this
                 sort should take place without my
                 being asked to attend.WELLESOf what sort?LONGDALEYou are a private investigator?WELLESThat's right.LONGDALEWell, whatever reasons Mrs.
                 Christian has for engaging the
                 services of a private investigator,
                 I should certainly be a party to.
                 But, since she feels differently, I
                 can only go on the record as having
                 expressed my adamant disapproval.MRS CHRISTIANYes, how theatrical.  So you've gone
                 on the record, and now perhaps you
                 should just be gone. 

     Longdale's irritated, but has no choice.  He walks away.MRS CHRISTIANHave a pleasant evening. 
                       (to Welles) 
                 Will you have tea, Mister Welles?WELLESThank you. 

     Mrs. Christian begins pouring tea from the service on a
     table.  Welles watches Longdale exit.WELLESHe's odd.MRS CHRISTIANHe's a lawyer.
                       (offers tea)
                 Please, sit, here...

     Welles accepts a dainty tea cup and saucer, taking a seat.MRS CHRISTIANI've spoken to friends of mine and
                 my husband's, in Harrisburg, in
                 Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about
                 you.  I must say you have friends in
                 influential places.WELLESI've been privileged to provide
                 services for people I admire.MRS CHRISTIANYou are highly recommended.  Praised
                 for your discretion... your strict
                 adherence to confidentiality. 

     Welles nods, sipping tea.MRS CHRISTIANAs you know, my husband passed away
                 recently.  Two weeks ago now.WELLESMy condolences.MRS CHRISTIANHis passing has left me with...
                 something of a dilemma.  A terrible,
                 terrible dilemma.WELLESI'll do whatever I can to help. 

     Mrs. Christian studies Welles.INT. CHRISTIAN HOUSE, MR CHRISTIAN'S OFFICE -- NIGHTMrs. Christian and Welles enter.  This office has been lived
     in for a lifetime.  Giant DESK.  AMERICAN FLAG.  Walls
     covered in old b+w PHOTOGRAPHS and ACHIEVEMENTS. A large,
     baked enamel sign nailed up, "CHRISTIAN STEEL."MRS CHRISTIANHis inner sanctum. 

     Welles looks up at the OIL PAINTING over the fireplace: MR.
     CHRISTIAN, a powerful, old man, posed with a dark, teeming,
     industrial landscape behind him.MRS CHRISTIANNot many people have been inside
                 this room. 

     Welles examines PHOTOS of Mr. Christian visiting various
     STEEL PLANTS, COAL MINES and ground-breaking ceremonies,
     shaking hands with WORKMEN, with POLITICIANS.WELLESPittsburgh?MRS CHRISTIANMostly.  That's where he started his
                 empire building.
                       (looks up at portrait)
                 He was a good man.  Notorious as an
                 eccentric, but that was something he
                 cultivated.  Hewantedto be
                 legendary.WELLESHe succeeded.MRS CHRISTIANWe were married forty-five years.
                 Hard even for me to imagine.  We had
                 our troubles.  There were plenty of
                 places for him to be other than
                 here, but he was always loyal to me,
                 and I to him.  I loved him deeply.

     Welles waits.MRS CHRISTIANDo you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?WELLESI wear a gun when I can tell a
                 client expects me to.  Other than
                 that, there's never any reason.MRS CHRISTIANJust curious. 

     Mrs. Christian crosses to take down a PICTURE, revealing a
     WALL SAFE.  The safe is ajar, burnt and scarred, broken into.MRS CHRISTIANMy husband was the only one with the
                 combination to this safe.  I knew
                 about it, but as far as I was
                 concerned it was none of my
                 business.  Not till now, that is.WELLESYou hired someone to open it.  I'll
                 bet the lawyer loved that.MRS CHRISTIANThere was nothing he could do.  My
                 husband left everything to me.
                       (looks at safe)
                 I prevented anyone from seeing the
                 contents.  I felt these were my
                 husband's private things.  I
                 didn't... I didn't realize...WELLESDo you want to tell me what you
                 found?MRS CHRISTIANCash, stock certificates, and this...

     She takes something from her pocket, puts it on the desk: a
     plastic bag containing a short 8MM FILM on a plastic reel.MRS CHRISTIANIt's a film... of a girl being
                 murdered.WELLESI'm afraid I don't...MRS CHRISTIANThis is a movie showing a girl being
                 murdered.  She's sitting on a bed,
                 and a man rapes her... and he begins
                 to cut her with a knife...
                       (pause)
                 I only watched what I could.

     Welles picks up the film, looks at it.MRS CHRISTIANI didn't know what to think.  I
                 can't tell you how horrible it's
                 been, to know this belonged to my
                 husband.  To know that he watched
                 this... this atrocity.  But, I can't
                 go to the police...WELLESMrs. Christian... please, will you
                 sit down a moment? 
                       (leads her to a chair) 
                 I want you to listen carefully.
                 What you're talking about is a
                 "snuff film."  But, from what I
                 know, snuff films are a kind of...
                 urban myth.  Like, red light
                 district folklore.  There's no such
                 thing, I can assure you. 

     Mrs. Christian shakes her head.WELLESPlease, believe me.  This is
                 probably a stag film.  Simulated
                 rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might
                 seem real, but there are ways of
                 making it look realistic... fake
                 blood and special effects...MRS CHRISTIANNo.WELLESIf you were to study it you'd see
                 the camera cutting away... you'd see
                 the tricks they can play...MRS CHRISTIANI'm telling you it's not that.WELLESI'm sure it is. 
                       (smiles) 
                 It's probably something your husband
                 was given as a bad joke.  More than
                 likely he never even watched it.MRS CHRISTIANWill you watch it and see for
                 yourself?WELLESOf course.  But, I'm certain it's
                 nothing to worry about.INT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, DINING ROOM -- NIGHTAn 8MM PROJECTOR faces a wall.  Welles looks back to Mrs.
     Christian in the doorway.  Mrs. Christian leaves, shuts the
     door.  Darkness.  Welles turns on the projector and sits.
     The PROJECTOR CLATTERS, shooting bright images...

     ON THE WALL: FLASH FRAMES, over exposure, then... the grainy
     FILM is HAND HELD, constantly in motion, showing a skinny
     GIRL, 16 or 17, in a negligee, sitting on a bed in a
     nondescript room with little furniture.  Looks like a hotel
     room.  We only ever see three walls.  The once beautiful
     girl looks worn, drugged, dark circles under her eyes,
     staring blankly.  The CAMERA'S tungsten SPOTLIGHT casts
     long, shifting shadows as the camera moves, but the girl
     still stares oblivious.  The bed is wrapped in PLASTIC and
     DUCT TAPE.  The floor is covered by PLASTIC SHEETING...

     Welles watches, crossing his arms, already uncomfortable.

     ON THE WALL: a door opens behind the girl, looks like a
     bathroom, and a MASKED MAN enters.

     The Masked Man wears a garish, Mexican WRESTLING MASK with
     eye holes and a mouth.  The mask covers his entire head.
     He's naked except for red shorts, his body scrawny, oiled,
     pale.  The man goes to stand in front of the girl.  He seems
     to be saying something to her, but the film is silent and
     the ONLY SOUND is the PROJECTOR'S LOUD sprocket hole
     CLATTER.  It's all one long take.  The CAMERA MOVES to favor
     the girl...

     Welles sits straight in his chair, wary.

     ON THE WALL: Masked Man raises his open hand and SLAPS the
     girl, knocking her back on the bed...

     Welles grimaces.

     ON THE WALL: Masked Man pulls the girl back to a seated
     position.  The girl's like a rag doll, face reddened, eyes
     closed, but she remains upright.  Masked Man uses his thumbs
     to open her unseeing eyes.  He touches her mouth with his
     fingers, presses his lips to hers.  Then, Masked Man backs
     away, leaving frame, till the CAMERA MOVES to find Masked
     Man standing at a table with THREE large BOWIE KNIFES laid
     out.  Masked Man runs his fingers over the blades...

     Welles rises slowly, still watching.

     ON THE WALL: Masked Man selects a huge Bowie knife and moves
     back towards the girl...

     Welles crosses his arms tight, disbelieving, fearful.WE WILL NEVER SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IN THE FILM, but Welles
     does.  In the flickering, reflected light, Welles backs
     involuntarily away from the horrible images, holding his
     fist to his mouth, breathing hard.

     Welles keeps backing away, till he's backed against a wall.
     The PROJECTOR'S CLATTERING.  Welles is sickened, sweating,

                 hitchhiking off 81, which heads into
                 Philadelphia, started up a
                 conversation with this girl, she
                 looked homeless, seemed about
                 eighteen maybe.  They convinced her
                 to let them buy her a meal in the
                 city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have
                 much to say, but they got a sense

                 people, but they don't want to get
                 too involved.  They're not trying to

     highlights a section in the book he's reading.

     Welles notes this.  He goes to the substantial MAGAZINE
     RACK, picks up a porn tabloid, pages through it.  He selects
     sex MAGAZINES and NEWSPAPERS, choosing about twenty-five.

     labyrinth hallway lit by bare bulbs.  Welles follows.

     They come to another STAIRWAY leading down.  At the bottom,
     a thick-necked GOON stands guarding double doors.GOONAre you a law enforcement agent or

     of small, underground porn flea market.  It's incredibly
     quiet.  About fifteen CARD TABLES are set up in rows.  The
     MEN behind the tables and the thirty or so "CUSTOMERS"
     looking through the merchandise make those in the previous
     porn shops look like high society.

     These are MIDDLE-AGED MEN, most balding, some with pot
     bellies, in shorts and tube socks, in sweatpants and Members
     Only jackets: plain men, but with a look of desperation in
     their eyes, glancing around nervously, greasy and afraid.ONE DEALERWe're shutting down in fifteen
                 minutes.  Fifteen minutes.

     Welles makes his way to the tables, wary.  One table is
     covered in dirty cardboard boxes, filled with HUNDREDS of
     PHOTOS of young children, mostly boys, naked.  Each photo is
     wrapped in plastic, censored by masking tape.

     Welles swallows back disgust.

     The next table is piled high with used pornographic
     MAGAZINES.  There are baggies with COLORFUL PILLS laid out.
     X-rated Polaroids wrapped in rubberbands.

     Max follows behind, unaffected, smokes a cigarette.

     Another table offers VIDEO TAPES with no identifying marks
     other than hand written labels with numbers written out,
     "two," "sixteen," "five."  And many bootleg VIDEOS with
     grainy, homemade labels showing WOMEN in extreme BONDAGE.

     Welles watches out the corner of his eye as the PLUMP MAN
     beside him pays for a thick stack of kiddie porn pictures.
     Welles waits till the man moves on, addresses the angry
     looking DEALER who's counting money.WELLES(points to numbered videos)
                 What are these?ANGRY DEALERMixed hard bondage.  Rape films.

     The dealer sits and keeps counting cash.
     Welles moves on Beyond the tables there's a CURTAINED
     DOORWAY.  Welles walks to it, enters...INSIDE THE CURTAINFolding chairs face a SCREEN.  A PROJECTOR shows a silent
     movie; a BUXOM WOMAN in nurses uniform prepares an enema bag
     and tube.  A hairy, overweight MAN lays face down on an
     examination table, naked, arms tied behind his back.

     In the darkness, a MAN shifts in his chair, grunting,
     obviously masturbating.  A few chairs away, a man is bent
     over, moving his head in the lap of SOMEONE in a BLONDE WIG.

     A LARGE MAN approaches Welles from the dark.LARGE MANYou have to pay to come in here. 

     Welles backs away, shuts the curtain.INT.  ALL-NIGHT COFFEE SHOP -- NIGHTNot many people in the place.  Welles drinks coffee.  Max
     eats a huge breakfast.MAXYou've got Penthouse, Playboy,

                 X.  The difference is penetration.
                 That's hardcore.  That whole

                 They're celebrities, or they think

                 they're lying.  Somebody's buying

                 another guy looks at it and falls in
                 love.  Now, with some of the S+M and
                 bondage films, they straddle the
                 line.  How are you supposed to tell

                 gag in their mouth is a consenting
                 or not?  Step over that line, you're

                 thing.WELLESWhat other ways are there to get
                 illegal films?  Who do you see?MAXFirst of all, basement sales like
                 tonight aren't gonna last much
                 longer.  It's too risky, one, and
                 two, everything's going on the
                 internet.  Anyone with a computer
                 and enough patience can find
                 anything he wants.  It's heaven for
                 those degenerate chicken-hawks.
                 They're swapping pictures back and
                 forth as fast as their modems can
                 zap 'em.  But, there's still some
                 weird shit under the counter where
                 I work sometimes.  No one knows where
                 it comes from.  That's local
                 underground, where information
                 spreads by word of mouth.  Those are
                 zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their
                 hands are permanently pruned.  They
                 go out in the sun they don't burn,
                 they blister.  Other than that, all
                 I know about is the mail.
                 Classified ads in the paper with
                 hidden codes.  Secret couriers.
                 Credit card orders to dummy
                 corporations.  Interstate wire
                 transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes.
                 But, if you're asking me who do you
                 go to to get illegal shit... who
                 knows?  That's the whole point --
                 the seller stays as far away from
                 the buyer as possible, and vice
                 versa, and cops can't trace the
                 deal.  There's ways to do it so
                 nobody knows who anybody is.

     listening device inside the phone, puts it back together.

     stands, looking down at the phone, frozen.  Finally, he runs
     his hands through his hair, looks around the room, sits back

     through her fishnet stockings, poorly covered by make-up.

     Elevator doors open on the SECOND FLOOR.  The two women get
     out and walk down a grey hallway, towards DOUBLE DOORS
     painted black.  Welles stops the elevator door from closing.

     The women push the INTERCOM at the black doors.  Another

     Max is asleep in the bed, PIZZA BOX near his feet.

     Welles drinks beer, gets up and ejects the CASSETTE from a
     VCR, tosses it aside, tired.  He picks another Dino Velvet
     TAPE, puts it in, sits.

     ON TV: GOTHIC ROCK is HEARD over old, scratchy IMAGES: of
     Klansmen around a burning cross... Dracula menacing a
     sleeping woman... a man in a Devil costume dancing...

     Welles opens another beer.

     ON TV: a WOMAN is tied up, arms in the air, hanging from the
     ceiling, gagged and blindfolded, in a dungeon lit by
     candelabras.  Then, glimpsed IMAGES: worms writhing in
     slime... gargoyles... a guillotine falling.  Then, the bound
     woman, struggling.  A MASKED MAN in a leather jacket enters.
     He wears a LEATHER MASK with zipper eyes and mouth...

     Welles watches.  On the TV, Masked Man takes off his jacket
     shirtless, reveals an impossibly muscled body.  Huge arms,
     thick chest, oiled, dotted in pimples.MAXWhy?  He have something to do with
                 whatever you're into?

     Still watching the behemoth on TV, Welles is less sure.

     ON TV: the bulging Masked Man flexes, ripped.WELLESNo... it's nothing... that's not him.

     Welles rubs his eyes, sits back.  Max sits up, watching.

     ON TV: Masked Man pulls the bound woman's head back by her
     hair, licks her face with his thick tongue...

     CLOSE ON: Masked Man grips the woman's head, still licking.
     He pulls down the woman's blindfold...

     Welles sits forward, realizing, horrified...

     Welles goes to the VCR, hits PAUSE.  The IMAGE on TV
     FREEZES.  Welles goes back, FRAME by FRAME...

     ... to the CLOSE UP where Masked Man grips the woman's face.
     FREEZE FRAME.  On Masked Man's hand: a TATTOO, on the arch

                 call him.  Machine. 

     Welles hits PLAY.  On TV, Masked Man runs his hands up and
     down the woman's body.  The woman's eyes are filled with
     fear.  Welles sits, unnerved, watching.MAXThey say he's half brain-dead from
                 all the steroids he's using.

     In the middle of the warehouse, Dino Velvet stands, in a
     powder blue suit, holding an archery BOW and ARROW.DINO VELVETThere you are.  Come join us.

     There's a wrought IRON BED not far from Dino.  MACHINE is
     seated on the mattress, a huge man, wearing a leather S+M
     harness and the same WRESTLING MASK as in the snuff film.

     Welles gathers his courage, walks towards them.

     Dino pulls back on the bow, aiming away across the
     warehouse.  He stands by a TABLE with a QUIVER of ARROWS
     propped up.  He shoots an arrow toward a large TARGET...

     Strikes the target dead center, BULL'S-EYE.  As Welles gets
     closer, he notices several things ... 

     ... a 16MM CAMERA mounted on a TRIPOD, facing the bed, along
     with several movie LIGHTS

     ... several BOWIE KNIFES are laid out on the table, beside
     a pair of HANDCUFFS...

     ... Machine is watching him as he approaches...

     Welles stops, not far from Dino and Machine, but keeping his
     distance.  Dino's still firing arrows at the target.
     Machine's still staring at Welles.WELLES(to Machine)
                 Hello.

     Machine just stares at him with bloodshot eyes.DINO VELVETYou brought the money?WELLES(takes out envelope)

     Dino lets fly another arrow... another bull's-eye, then
     turns to look at Welles with a smile.DINO VELVETExcellent.WELLESWhere are the women?DINO VELVETThey should be here any minute.

     Welles comes forward slowly, places the envelope on the
     table, beside Bowie knifes.  He's sweating.WELLES(of the knifes)

                 props.  Nice, aren't they?WELLESSure.

     Dino walks across towards the target.DINO VELVETMachine and I were just talking
                 about knifes.  The beauty of
                 knifes...

     Dino pulls arrows from the target.DINO VELVETHe was saying how fascinated he is
                 by their simple ability to be sharp.
                 The ability of a piece of metal to
                 be so thin that it is almost
                 nothing...

     Dino walks back to the table, replaces the arrows in the
     quiver, cueing another arrow in is bow.DINO VELVETSo close to nothingness that it cuts
                 with minimum effort, because it's so
                 non-intrusive.  Flesh is fooled.  It
                 blooms open as the blade widens, but
                 by then it's too late, because the
                 knife's already doing its pure,
                 simple damage.

     Dino shoots another arrow to the target.
     A CLATTER attracts Welles attention.  Far across the
     warehouse, a DELIVERY DOOR rolls upwards.  A CAR with tinted
     windows drives in...

     The MAN who opened the door, silhouetted in sunlight, stays
     behind to close the door as the car pulls forward...DINO VELVETAh, ours guests have arrived.

     Machine stands.  He is a giant.
     Welles takes a few steps back, wary, sweating hard now.

     The car parks across the warehouse, not far from the target.

     Dino puts another arrow in his bow, pulls it taunt, aims at
     the target... turns, aims the arrow at Welles.DINO VELVETMister Welles... would you be so
                 kind as to remove any firearms from
                 your person?WELLESWhat are you... ?DINO VELVETTake out your gun!

     Welles brings his hand towards his holster...DINO VELVETSlowly.  Let me see it.

     Welles takes out his gun, looks across the warehouse...

     The SILHOUETTED MAN is walking this way.  Can't tell who he
     is yet.  Machine heads the direction of the parked car.DINO VELVETEmpty the gun onto the table, very
                 carefully.WELLESLook, I don't know what this...DINO VELVETShut up, cunt!  Do exactly as I say,
                 or I'll put this arrow through your
                 throat.

     Welles obeys, helpless, dumps the bullets out on the table.

     The SILHOUETTED MAN'S getting closer.  It's Eddie Poole.EDDIEIs that him?DINO VELVET(to Welles)

     Welles obeys, walks to the bed.
     Welles attaches one cuff to the bed's iron rail, fastens the
     other cuff around his wrist. Dino puts down the bow and arrow.DINO VELVET(still to Welles)
                 Didn't know what to make of you at
                 first, and you certainly had Eddie
                 on pins and needles.  But, lo and
                 behold, from out of the blue came an
                 old business acquaintance to explain

     Welles looks across to the car...

     wheel and hands the keys to Machine, walks this way...EDDIEThis is the fucker?  Motherfucker,
                 doesn't look like anything...

     Eddie walks around the bed, studies Welles.  Welles watches
     him.  Eddie goes to stand behind Welles, rushes forward...

     PUNCHES Welles in the side of the head.
     Welles goes down, clutching his face.EDDIEDoesn't look like shit.

     Eddie pulls Welles to his feet, throws him against the bed,
     frisking him from head to toe.

     Longdale comes to stand beside Dino, nervous, taking out a
     tiny HANDGUN and pointing it at Welles.  Welles looks up,
     holding his head, afraid, sits on the bed.DINO VELVET(to Welles)

     Dino comes to sit on the bed beside Welles.DINO VELVETYou're going to go get the film you
                 received from Mrs. Christian, bring
                 it here and put it in my hand.  And
                 to save time, so we make this as
                 efficient as possible, there's an
                 incentive...

     Dino puts his fingers in his mouth, lets out a sharp WHISTLE.

     Across the warehouse, Machine uses the car keys to open the
     trunk of the car, pulls SOMEONE out...

     It's Max, beaten bloody, bound, face swollen, gagged, hardly
     conscious.  Machine throws him to the floor.WELLESNo...

     Welles tries to go towards Max, yanked back by the
     handcuffs, pulls the bed a few inches, but it's heavy.DINO VELVETFriend of yours?WELLESLook, he's got nothing to do with
                 this... let him go...DINO VELVETCan you guess what I'm going to say

                 box, in the city...DINO VELVETHow cooperative.  Longdale will keep
                 you company.

     Dino takes out HANDCUFF KEYS, throws them to Longdale.
     Longdale approaches Welles carefully, unlocking him.DINO VELVETDon't let Longdale's questionable
                 choice of weapon give you any ideas.
                 If his fey little gun puts enough

     face, blood pouring out between his fingers.

     out in surprise.  He looks down at the knife in his chest.

     his gushing face, falls, tries to get back up...

     Eddie runs towards Welles.

     Dino stumbles forwards, writhing, then suddenly lays still.

     Machine rises, looking at Dino.  Tears come out from
     Machine's eyes and roll down his mask.

     One last gasp and shudder from Dino's body; death rattle.

     Welles pulls the bed, practically pulling his arm from the
     socket, desperately clawing towards the table...
     The table is mere feet away...

     Eddie arrives, KICK Welles in the ribs...

     Welles recoils.  Eddies KICKS again.  Welles curls into a

     Eddie runs for the gun.

     knocks the table over.  He's got the gun, but...

                 all it took for you to murder her?EDDIEIt was a lot of fucking money.

     Welles stands and paces, despairing.  He picks up a LAMP and
     throws it, SHATTERS a MIRROR, keeps pacing...WELLESSo... you brought Dino in, and he
                 brought Machine.  And, one day, a
                 girl walked into your office because

                 beautiful she was, told her she was
                 gonna be a star.  I told her I was
                 gonna get her a screen test, and
                 while I'm doing that, I got her a
                 soda and dropped a mickey.  When it
                 was dark enough, I rang Dino and
                 told him it was go time, I put her
                 in the trunk of my car and we went
                 and we fucking did it.  That's what
                 happened.  She's dead.  She's been

     skeleton.  What remains of the OFFICE and RIGHT WING is
     boarded over, falling apart.  No window has gone unbroken.IN THE LOTWelles turns out headlights and parks.
     He gets out, walks to look up the driveway.  A CAR is HEARD.
     HEADLIGHTS can be seen a good distance away through the

                 think... we weren't burying
                 treasure.  We didn't pace it out so
                 we could come back and get it.  We
                 dug a hole and we put her in it.
                 Your guess is as good as mine.

     Welles walks ahead of Eddie, distraught, shining his
     flashlight ahead across the indecipherable forest floor.EDDIEYou'll never find her.  Nobody ever
                 will, and even if they did, it
                 doesn't mean nothing.  Bring in the
                 cops, bring in the F.B.I., fuck 'em

                 happened.  Don't you get it?  It's
                 over.  You can't do anything.

     Welles turns, aims his gun at Eddie, furious.WELLESI can kill you.  I can leave you out
                 here, just like you left her.

     Eddie's not backing down.EDDIEDo it.WELLESDon't think I won't.EDDIEDo it!  Put me out of my misery so

     Eddie walks towards Welles.  Welles backs away...EDDIEWhere you going?  You're the one
                 with the gun.  Aren't I defenseless
                 enough?  Come on...

     Eddie comes ahead, defiant, the gun inches from his face.EDDIEGo ahead and kill me.  Kill me with

     Welles step forward, presses the gun against Eddie's
     forehead, pulls back the hammer... 

     Eddie just stares back at Welles with hatred in his eyes.

     Welles is terrified, unsure... trying to muster the courage
     to do it... gun hand trembling... finger on the trigger...INT.  MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- NIGHTEddie's thrown face down to the floor.  Welles comes to sit
     on Eddie's back, facing Eddie's feet, holsters his gun,
     takes out duct tape and grabs Eddie's feet, wrapping them...EDDIEYou pussy.

     Welles keeps going around Eddie's ankles with the duct tape,
     till Eddie's securely bound.

     He rips the tape roll free and gets up, walking out...EDDIEFucking pussy!EXT.  MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHTWelles pulls the door closed behind him, walks to his car.IN THE CARWelles opens the passenger door and sits, shaken, at his

     He looks back to the motel room.

     He looks down to the glove compartment, at his CELLULAR
     PHONE.  After a moment, Welles picks up the phone, looks at
     it in his hand.IN THE LOTWelles gets out of the car, gets up on the hood, lays back,
     staring at the sky.  He closes his eyes, smokes.

     Welles opens the phone, looks at the illuminated numbers.
     He digs in his suit jacket pocket, takes out his notepad,
     pages through, studies one page.

     Welles sits up.  He gathers himself, throws his cigarette,
     dials a number, puts the cellular to his ear, afraid...MRS MATHEWS (V.O.)(from phone)

     MRS MATHEWS is HEARD SCREAMING, letting out a CHOCKING SOB.
     Welles falls back against the car, holds his head, weeping...WELLESI'm sorry, I'm so sorry... there
                 wasn't anything anyone could do...

     Welles pushes disconnect, lowers the phone, drops it to the
     ground, utterly drained.  He puts his forearm over his eyes,
     gasping, sucking air...

     He looks to the motel room, tamping down his sorrow, willing
     it to fuel his rage...

     He takes out his gun, hands unsteady, determined, opens the
     gun and pours the bullets out.  He closes the gun and walks
     towards the motel room...INT.  MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- CONTINUOUSWelles SHOVES the door aside.  The door's hinge breaks and
     the door falls...

     Eddie sits propped up against one wall, turns to look...

     Welles moves forward, enraged, closing on Eddie, raising his
     arm with the gun grasped by the butt...

     through the open door of the room.  A CAR is HEARD, getting
     LOUDER as it passes, FAINTER as it gets further away.

     Finally, Welles comes to the doorway, in shock, steadying
     himself against the door frame, shirt and suit spattered
     red.  His gun hand and gun are soaked with dripping blood.

     Welles looks back into the room, backing away.  He turns and
     goes to his car...IN THE CARWelles climbs in the driver's side, shoves his bloody gun

                 Where?  Astoria, Queens.

     Welles is scribbling all this down in his notepad.EXT.  QUEENS STREET -- DAYA relatively quiet residential street.  HOMES are small, two
     story affairs, close together, each very much like its
     neighbor, some with tiny yards fenced in by brick walls.

     Welles' Ford comes slowly down the street.  CHILDREN in
     school uniforms are heading off for the day in groups.

     Welles parallel parks.IN THE CARWelles turns off the engine.
     He's watching a HOUSE on the other side of the street.  The
     house is brick on the bottom, aluminum siding on top,
     quaint, with brick staircase from the front door down to a
     GARAGE underneath, plastic PINK FLAMINGOS on the small lawn.

     Cars pass in the street.  Welles watches school children
     pass on the near sidewalk.  He slumps down a little in his
     seat, adjusting the rearview mirror, adjusting his side
     mirror, rolling up the window.

     Welles takes a cautionary look around, takes out his gun,
     pours bullets out and pockets them.  He picks up a PAPER BAG
     off the passenger seat and opens it.

     He takes out a long, thin metal FILE, pulling off the shrink
     wrap packaging, feels the file with his thumb.

     Keeping his open gun low under the steering wheel, Welles
     slides the file into the barrel, scraping gently all along
     the gun's inner barrel.DISSOLVE TO:INT.  WELLES' CAR -- LATER DAYWelles sits smoking a cigarette, watching the quaint house.
     He looks in his side mirror...

     There's a large CAR coming down the block with its turn
     signal on.  Welles slumps a little lower.

     The car passes, slowing.  The GARAGE DOOR of the quaint
     house begins to open. 

     Welles watches...
     Can't really see the driver of the car except for the back
     of his head, but he's huge.  It's a good bet it's Machine.
     Beside him in the passenger seat is a GREY HAIRED OLD WOMAN.

     The car pulls into the darkness of the quaint house's
     garage.  After a moment, the OLD WOMAN comes from the
     garage, walks with a cane, wears glasses.  She goes to the
     sidewalk, checks her MAILBOX, finds it empty.

     Welles watches.

     The old woman goes back to the garage.  She goes inside.
     The garage door closes behind her.DISSOLVE TO:INT.  WELLES' CAR -- NIGHTWelles still watches the house.  There's a light on in one
     of the second floor windows, curtains closed.

     Welles yawns, shaking his head, trying to stay awake.

     At the quaint house, a light comes on in the front picture
     window.  Looks like a living room or dining room.  The old
     woman comes to sit at a table.

     Welles takes binoculars off the front seat...THROUGH BINOCULARSThe old woman says something to someone we cannot see.
     She's at the dinner table, with a place setting in front of
     her.  After a moment, someone joins her...

     It's Machine, you can tell by his bulk, by his huge
     forearms.  The lacy curtains of the window block part of our
     view, so we never see his face.IN THE CARWelles lowers the binoculars, still watching.

     Through the window across the street, Machine can be seen
     putting a plate of food in front of the old woman.  The old
     woman smiles up at him, says something.

     Machine goes to light two candles on the table with matches,
     then goes back to stand beside the old woman.

     Machine is seen from behind, bends to give the old woman a
     kiss on the cheek, then leaves the room.  The old woman
     starts to eat.DISSOLVE TO:INT.  WELLES' CAR -- DAYDawn light is just breaking.  Welles has fallen asleep,
     slumped low behind the wheel, snoring lightly.

     Welles awakens with a start, looking around, confused.  He
     calms, rubbing his eyes, wiping sweat from his features.ACROSS THE STREETThe quaint house's garage door begins to rise.IN THE CARWelles sees this, keeps low, watching...
     The big car backs out into the street.  The old woman's
     behind the wheel, wearing a hat, driving away, alone.

     Welles watches the car head away in the rear view mirror.ON THE STREETWelles gets out of his car, shuts the door quietly behind
     him.  He starts walking towards the quaint house, looks all
     directions, making sure no one's around.

     Ahead, the garage door begins to close.

     Welles picks up the pace, trying not to look too
     conspicuous.  The garage door's halfway down...

     Welles runs towards the garage, has to dive and roll to get
     there, but he makes it under the door just as it closes.ABOVEIn ONE WINDOW of the quaint house, an eyeball is peering out
     from lacy curtains, then moves away and curtains fall shut.INT.  QUAINT HOUSE, GARAGE -- DAYWelles gets up, takes out his gun, brushing off.
     The garage is dark, full of BOXES and JUNK.  Welles moves
     towards the door to the house.INT.  QUAINT HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAYMachine, in T-shirt and jeans,seen only from behind, comes
     to a DRESSER and opens a bottom drawer.  His huge hands push
     clothing aside, digging deep to the bottom of the drawer,
     taking out the WRESTLING MASK.

     Machine stands straight, pulling the mask down over his head.INT.  BASEMENT -- DAYWelles enters from the garage, gun up.  The dank basement is
     small.  A PILE of LAUNDRY lies on the floor near a WASHINGMACHINE.SHEETS hang off several CLOTHES LINES strung across two
     metal poles.  Welles leads with his gun...

     He moves around the sheets, looking behind them.  There's a
     WOODEN STAIRCASE leading upstairs.  Welles starts up,
     treading lightly, trying not to make a sound...INT.  KITCHEN -- DAYWelles slowly opens the door to the kitchen, pointing his
     gun.  No one here.  The decor is feminine, neat and tidy.
     It's grandma's house, and it shows, with gaudy PRINT
     WALLPAPER everywhere, every shelf displaying HUMMEL
     FIGURINES or COLLECTORS PLATES.  Very Home Shopping Network.INT.  DINING ROOM/LIVING ROOM -- DAYWelles slowly opens the swinging door, entering from the
     kitchen, sweeping the room with his gun.  No sign of
     Machine.  The whole house is dead quiet.

     He passes the dining room TABLE where he watched the old
     woman eat last night... passes fake PAINTINGS on the walls,
     of waterfalls and sunset mountain landscapes... moves into
     the living room area...

     Yellow shag CARPET.  A pink SOFA is covered in clear
     plastic, facing an old TELEVISION in faux-wooden cabinet.
     Welles heads for a staircase leading to the second floor.

     Welles creeps up the stairs...INT.  SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAYWelles comes up from the stairs, arrives at a closed DOOR.
     He opens the door.  It's a linen closet, with TOWELS and
     SHEETS on shelves, and a shelf of MEDICINE.

     Welles shuts the door and moves on.  There are TWO DOORS
     ahead, both closed.  Welles takes the one to the right...INT.  MACHINE'S BEDROOM -- DAYWelles pushes the door in, enters warily.  There's a
     constant SCRATCHING HEARD.  The room is like a child's,
     except the BED is huge.  Shelves are full of BOARDGAMES and
     COMIC BOOKS.  A DANZIG POSTER on the wall.  There's a RECORD
     PLAYER with LP RECORDS beside it.  A record turns on the
     turntable, the needle caught at the center, SCRATCHING...

     Welles eases his way over to the closet... reaching...
     Pulls it open, steps back, gun up.  Nothing.  Just clothing.INT.  SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAYWelles crosses, opens the door across the hall, enters...

     DOWN THE HALL, very slowly, Machine's head rises on the
     stairs, in the garish wrestling mask, peering.INT.  GRANDMA'S ROOM -- DAYWelles stays near the door, looks around.  There's a fuzzy
     sky-blue COMFORTER on the bed, fuzzy blue SLIPPERS nearby.
     Lots of bottles of MEDICINE on the bedside table.

     Welles lowers his gun, takes a step back, into the hall...INT.  SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAYWelles turns...
     Machine charges down the hall, screaming with rage, BOWIE
     KNIFE raised to kill...

     Welles brings his gun up, but Machine's upon him, stabbing...

     Welles catches Machine's hand, stops the knife.  Machine
     grips Welles' gun hand, shoving him back...

     Welles is SLAMMED against the wall, grappling, gun hand
     pinned.  Welles GUN GOES OFF, once... twice...

     BLOWING HOLES in the ceiling.  Machine's grunts, pushing the
     knife forward... closer to Welles, face... closer...

     Welles struggles, overpowered.  The tip of the horrible
     knife is inches away...

     Welles bends his knees, crouching, trying to gain distance
     from the blade...

     Machine pulls Welles gun hand lower, brings it against the
     swinging LAUNDRY CHUTE DOOR built into the wall, begins
     twisting Welles' hand back, trying to pry the gun loose...

     Welles looks out the corner of his eyes to his gun...

     Welles turns his gun hand, slowing struggling to aim the gun
     towards the knife, but it's awful close to his face...

     The knife's shaking, less than an inch from Welles' cheek...

     Welles shuts his eyes and turns his head, letting out a CRY,
     FIRES his gun...

     The bullet BLASTS Machine's knife, knocks it away!

     Machine recoils for a millisecond, but brings his now free
     hand to Welles' throat, choking him.  Welles' face reddens,
     bleeding from bullet fragments...

     Welles tries to pry Machine's fingers from his throat.

     Machine works on Welles' gun hand with violent, renewed
     effort -- SLAMS Welles' hand against the laundry chute...
     SLAMS it... SLAMS it... till Welles DROPS the GUN...
     The gun can be HEARD CLATTERING down the chute. 

     Machine brings his hand to join the other around Welles'
     throat.  Welles can't break the grip...

     Welles PUNCHES Machine's face, till blood runs out from the
     mask's nose hole, but it's having no effect...

     Welles brings his KNEE UP HARD -- into Machine's stomach!

     Machine falls to his knees with a ROAR, holds his already
     wounded stomach, bleeding through his shirt...

     Welles falls, clutching his throat, gasping.  He struggles
     to his feet, leaps past, headlong towards the stairs...

     Machine rises, charging after...ON THE STAIRCASEWelles is TACKLED from behind...
     Welles and Machine TUMBLE down the stairs, SMASHING the
     wooden railing, toppling a BOOKSHELF... LANDING HARD...

     Welles PUNCHES and KICKS, breaking free, running across the
     living room.  Machine rises to give chase...

     Welles grabs a dining room CHAIR and THROWS it...
     Machine knocks the chair aside, keeps coming.  Welles grips
     another chair, uses it to hold Machine off...

     Machine grips the chair by the legs.  Welles SHOVES forward,
     pushes Machine back, letting go...

     Welles dives under the dining table, crawling on his hands
     and knees, scrambling...

     Machine throws the chair, runs, leaps...
     Machine lands on the table, crawls to the far edge, GRABBING
     down with his meaty fists as Welles moves forward...

     Under the table, Welles jerks back, avoiding, then rises,
     extending his knees, PUSHING upwards from underneath...

     Welles FLIPS the table, throwing Machine to the floor...

     Welles charges towards the kitchen door, falls, gets up...
     Machine gets to his feet...IN THE KITCHENWelles SHOVES through the swinging door...
     Machine BURSTS through, catching Welles, TACKLING him...

     Welles hits the floor with Machine on top.  Machine begins
     to rein PUNCHES down on Welles, head and back...

     Welles tries to cover up, taking a real beating...

     Machine rises, gripping Welles, LIFTING him, THROWS him...

     Welles SMASHES into shelves of knick-knacks over the kitchen
     sink, SHATTERING a WINDOW, landing on the sink and counter.

     Machine comes to grip Welles again, drags him across the
     counter, KNOCKING EVERYTHING to the floor...
     Machine SWINGS Welles, releases him...

     Welles SLAMS the refrigerator and slumps to the ground,
     tries to stay conscious, trying weakly to get back up...
     Machine comes to Welles, gets on his knees...

     Machine wraps his arm around Welles' neck from behind, gets
     him in a CHOKE HOLD, tightens his grip, cutting off Welles
     airway with his forearm...

     Welles tries to break Machine's impossible grip with one
     hand, begins searching the floor with his other hand...
     frantically feeling for anything he can use...

     Welles' face is blood red...

     Welles' hand grasps desperately... finds a FORK, grips it...

     Welles SWINGS the fork back, STABS it into Machine's thigh!

     Machine SCREAMS, releases Welles and falls back, reaching
     around to the fork...

     Welles gets to his knees, sucking air, turns to look...

     Machine crawls away, pulls the fork out with trembling
     fingers.  Beyond him, there's the BASEMENT DOOR.

     Welles gets to his feet, looking...
     He grabs a FRYING PAN off the counter, gripping it in both
     hands and moving towards Machine...

     Machine's getting up...
     Welles BASHES Machine in the face with an upward swing of
     the frying pan...

     Machine is sent backpedaling, CRASHING into the oven!

     Welles drops the pan, leaps over Machine, to the door...IN THE BASEMENTWelles comes down the stairs, falls when he gets to the
     bottom, barely has any strength left.  He looks all
     directions, sees the LAUNDRY CHUTE in the ceiling...

     Welles gets up, stumbling, falls to his knees at the PILE of
     dirty LAUNDRY, starts digging through it, searching
     desperately, throwing clothing aside...

     Behind, Machine comes down the stairs, a bloody mess...

     Welles searches the laundry pile... 

     Machine reaches the bottom of the stairs, heading for
     Welles.  Welles turns, has the GUN in hand, FIRES TWICE...
     HITTING Machine in the shoulder and stomach, knocking
     Machine a few steps backwards...

     Welles FIRES...

     Machine's HIT in the CHEST, falling back, into hanging
     laundry, pulling down the clothes line and sheets...

     Machine hits the ground, wrapped in sheets.

     Welles stands, still aiming the gun, pulls the trigger on an
     empty chamber.  Out of bullets.

     Machine's trying to pull free from the sheets, trying to get
     back up to his feet.  Welles lets out a sob, drops the gun,
     walking to Machine...

     Welles climbs onto Machine from behind, takes clothing line
     in hand, starts wrapping the cord around Machine's throat...

     Welles pulls back on the clothes line, pulling it tight...

     Machine tries to get his fingers around the cord.  Welles
     stands, pulling tighter, putting a foot on Machine's back,
     pulling the clothes line with all his might...

     The cord's cutting into Welles' hand, drawing blood.

     Machine, face down, lets out a gurgling sound, struggling,
     struggling... till he finally stops moving.

     Welles releases the cord, takes a step back, breathing hard,
     trembling.  He looks around the basement.

     Welles walks to pick up his gun, replaces the gun in his
     holster.  He stands looking at Machine.

     Welles walks to Machine, bends, grasps Machine wrestling
     mask, pulling it off.  He rolls Machine over...

     the dark room, breathing hard.INT.  WELLES' HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHTCindy's in her high-chair by the table.  Amy's at the
     KITCHEN SINK, washing vegetables, peeling potatoes.

     Welles comes to stand in the doorway behind her.  Amy turns
     to look at him.  It breaks her heart to see him so wounded,
     but she forces herself to continue working in the sink.AMYHow much forgiveness do you think I
                 have in me?

     Welles comes into the kitchen, stands beside Cindy, puts his
     hand out and clasp's Cindy's tiny hand.WELLESI can't talk about it yet... not
                 yet.

     He takes out his wallet, opens it.

     In the fold of the wallet, there's a PHOTO folded into
     quarters.  Welles unfolds it and looks at it dolefully.
     It's the PHOTO of Mary Anne Mathews, the image Welles
     printed from early in the snuff film.  Sad girl.

     looks forward in the line to see if it's moving.EXT.  SUPERMARKET -- DAYWelles transfers BAGS of GROCERIES from the shopping cart
     into the back seat of his Ford.INT.  WELLES' FORD -- DAYWelles drives on the HIGHWAY, groceries in back.  He watches
     the roadway ahead.  There's little traffic.

     Welles glances down, turns on the RADIO.  Some CLASSICAL
     MUSIC PLAYS.  Welles stares forward through the windshield.

     After a moment, Welles turns the RADIO OFF.  He drives.  The
     ONLY SOUND is the DRONE of the ENGINE and TIRES.

     Welles is suddenly overwhelmed by emotion, eyes filling with
     tears.  He tries to fight it, but can't help himself.  His
     face contorts with sorrow and he cannot stop crying, letting
     out a loud WAIL of misery...EXT.  HIGHWAY -- DAY -- CONTINUOUSWelles' car moves to the shoulder, brakes to a sudden HALT.INT.  WELLES' FORD -- DAY -- CONTINUOUSWelles takes great deep breathes and lets them out, over and

     momentarily, then returns to reading.

     FOOTSTEPS can be HEARD coming through the house, getting
     CLOSER.  Amy looks up from her book.  The bedroom door's
     open a crack.  The door slowly pushes open.  Welles stands
     there, eyes red from crying.AMYTom... ?

     Welles comes into the room, stands before Amy.  He gets to
     his knees, puts his head in Amy's lap, wraps his arms around
     her waist.  Amy holds him, worried, eyes filling with tears.WELLESI have to tell you... I have to tell
                 you what happened.  I have to tell

                 anyone else.  No one else can ever
                 know.

     Amy runs her fingers through his hair, bends down to rest
     her head on his back, holding him with her eyes closed.
     Welles holds tighter.WELLESYou're all I've got.  You're all
                 I've ever had.
