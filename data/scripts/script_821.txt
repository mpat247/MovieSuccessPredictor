               A sign at one of the departure/arrival gates in the main 
               concourse-says the "San Diegan", number 2 64, is due at 12:00.

               Set above the gates, a big clock - six feet in diameter.THE TIME -12:06.We see the big hand slam into "7".

               a stuffed animal almost as large as she is, climbs down the 
               steps. She reaches the platform, looks around. From within 
               the train:GENELynn!  Lynn!!GENE WATSON, thirtyish, a regular Joe in appearance and 
               inclination, appears above, carrying a couple small suitcases. 
               He takes a relieved breath when he sees  her.GENELynn, don't walk ahead of me, OK?

               As he comes down the steps:GENEI'm serious, honey. Don't get out of 
                         my sight, all right? I want you to 
                         stay right by me. Will you do that 
                         for me?LYNNNods solemnly. GENE reaches the 
                         platform and gives out an exaggerated 
                         sigh.GENEWe made it.

               TEENS. They circle him, toss off a few taunts and roll away, 
               laughing.

               MR. SMITH and MS. JONES continue trolling the PASSENGERS as 
               they come through the gate.MS. JONESSkate-boarders I don't mind, even

               MR. SMITH has spotted someone.MR. SMITHI'm looking for them.MS. JONESWhere?MR. SMITHRight there.

               He starts walking towards the exit gate.INT. UNION STATION -ARRIVAL CONCOURSE - DAY - 12:09PMGENE has emerged with LYNN. They pause there, getting their 
               bearings. Next to them, a YOUNG COUPLE is kissing. They can't 
               keep their hands off each other.GENEI gotta make a phone call, Lynn. Do 
                         you see a phone?

               LYNN has seen the YOUNG COUPLE. She secretly points to them, 
               covers her mouth, and does a "tee, hee, hee" number. GENE 
               laughs.GENECome on, you.

               They start walking across the concourse, towards MR. SMITH 
               and MS. JONES.GENE(to LYNN)
                         Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss

                         like that?

               LYNN suddenly gets very sad. She looks at the ground, slows 
               down. GENE notices. He stops, crouches down to her level. 
               MR. SMITH and MS. JONES, nearing them, split apart, move 
               around them, and keep going.GENE(to LYNN)
                         Hey, it's OK to talk about her. You 
                         can talk about her all you want. You 
                         know that, don't you?

               LYNN nods.GENESo, come on. You never saw us kiss 
                         like that?LYNNNo way.GENEHow did you see us kiss?

               LYNN gives her own hand a little peck of a kiss.GENEThat's it? That little peck of a 
                         kiss? Oh, brother, you missed some 
                         kisses.LYNN laughs and throws herself on her dad. He holds her to 
               him, looks to the sky for help.. He finds himself staring at 
               the big clock.12:10.GENEOoh, I'm gonna be late. I gotta call.INT. UNION STATION - DAY - 12:10PMMR. SMITH and MS. JONES are making a beeline for their target: 
               the YOUNG KISSING COUPLE.

               WHOOSH! The-ROLLERBLADING TEENS almost collide with them. 
               MS. JONES wants to do something about it, but MR. SMITH pulls 
               her along. They have a mission to complete. They close in on 
               the couple.MR. SMITHLook at 'em. He'd do anything for 
                         her.-MS. JONESYoung love.

               The couple are murmuring sweet talk between kisses. The words 
               themselves are unclear until MR. SMITH and MS. JONES are 
               only a few feet away. French. They are speaking French. MR. 
               SMITH makes an instant one-eighty turn. MS. JONES follows.MR. SMITH(sotto voce)
                         Foreigners! Fuck!MS. JONESFrogs. They copy our blue jeans and 
                         when we need their help in Kuwait, 
                         where the fuck are they?

               MR. SMITH looks at the partner he's been saddled with.INT. UNION STATION - PAY PHONE AREA - DAY - 12:10PMGENE has found a pay phone. He keeps an eye on LYNN who has 
               wandered a few yards away.GENEHello, is Mr. Conners there? I have 
                         an interview with him at twelve-
                         thirty. Hi, Mr. Conners, this is 
                         Gene Watson. Sorry to call you at 
                         the last minute like this but... 
                         Hey, hey!

               He reacts to the ROLLERBLADING TEENS who swoop past LYNN, 
               one on each side, too close for a father's comfort.GENEWatch that! Lynn, come here!

               She does. He keeps an eye on the TEENS, who, having found a 
               victim, are circling around, passing MR. SMITH and .MS. JONES. 
               MR. SMITH has noticed GENE.

               GENE at the phone.GENESorry. There's some crazy kids on 
                         skates. Listen, the train just got 
                         in, I'm afraid I'm going to be a few 
                         minutes late.

               The TEENS make their pass, flip him the bird, engage in other 
               objectionable behavior, begin to circle again. MR. SMITH 
               watches GENE watch the TEENS, then notice a sturdy, sand-
               filled ashtray next to him.GENEGreat. OK, I'll get there as soon as 
                         I can. Bye, now.

               He hangs up. Keeping one eye on the circling TEENS.GENE(to LYNN)
                         Ready?LYNNNods.GENELet' s do it.

               He picks up a suit-case and accidently-on-purpose uses it to 
               knock over the ashtray, just as the TEENS approach. The 
               ashtray spills its Load of sand into their path. When they 
               hit it, their skates stop, they don't. They sprawl, doing 
               nasty things to knees and wrists.GENEWhoops.

               He stands over them with LYNN.GENENow, see, this is why you should 
                         always wear a helmet and knee pads. 
                         You never know when you're going to 
                         fall down and go boom. Right?LYNNRight.ANGLE ON MR. SMITH AND MS. JONES. - 12:11PMMR. SMITHPerfect.

               He starts forward.MS. JONES(not so sure)
                         Perfect.

               She follows. They intercept GENE. MR. SMITH flashes a badge.MR. SMITHCould I see some identification, 
                         sir?GENEWhat?MS. JONES(ditto with the badge)
                         I.D. Could we see some?GENEUh, sure. What's, what's the problem? 
                         Will a driver's license do?MR. SMITHThat'll do just fine.

               GENE pulls out his wallet, surprised and confused. MR. SMITH 
               looks at it.GENEIs this about those kids? Look, I'm 
                         sorry about that. But they darn 
                         near...MR. SMITHYou're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?GENEYes.MS. JONESWhere's that?GENENear Lompoc, north. What's...MR. SMITHCome with us, sir.GENEI'd like to know what...MR."SMITHDon't cause a ruckus, sir.

               He pulls open his coat, putting his hands on his hips, not-
               so coincidentally revealing the butt of a holstered gun.MR. SMITHYou don't want to cause a ruckus, 
                         with the little girl and all.MS. JONESCome with me, honey.

               MS. JONES swoops LYNN up and heads for the station entrance.GENEHey! I'll take the girl. I'll take 
                         the girl!MR. SMITHDon't worry. She's good with kids.

               GENE hurries after MS. JONES. MR. SMITH grabs up the 
               suitcases.INT. UNION STATION - SOUVENIR SHOP - DAY - 12:11PMMS. JONES nears a souvenir stand. The OWNER is looking the 
               other way. Without breaking stride, MS. JONES reaches out, 
               snatches a child's coloring book and crayons.LYNNYou stole that.MS. JONESNo, I didn't. I confiscated it. 
                         There's a difference.

               And they're out the door, GENE hurrying after. The big hand 
               on the big clock moves.12:12.EXT. UNION STATION PARKING LOT - DAY - 12:12PMMS. JONES heads for-a van with smoked windows. She gets inside 
               with LYNN. GENE stops a few feet away.GENEWhat is going on?

               MR. SMITH prods him in the ribs.MR. SMITHInto the van, Mr. Watson. Front seat.

               GENE looks desperately around for help. There is none. He 
               lets MR. SMITH push him toward the van.INT. VAN -.DAY - 12:13PMLYNN and MS. JONES are in the back.MS. JONESLet's get your seatbelt on. Always 
                         gotta wear your seatbelt, isn't that 
                         right?

               LYNN resists.LYNNI want my daddy.GENE climbs into the front passenger seat.MS. JONESThere's your daddy. See? We're your 
                         daddy's friends.

               MR. SMITH climbs into the driver's seat.MR. SMITHThat's right. The policeman is your 
                         friend. Isn't that right, Daddy?

               GENE looks down. MR.. SMITH has pulled his gun. He points it 
               casually so it's aiming through the seat in the general 
               direction of the little girl.MR. SMITHDaddy?GENEYes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our 
                         friends.MS. JONESHey, would you look at this crazy 
                         car? Everybody has their own radio. 
                         What do you think of that?LYNNEverybody does?MS. JONESYep. And you can listen to it without 
                         anybody else listening. Let's try it 
                         out.

               She puts some ear phones on her. She holds up the plug-in 
               end.MS. JONESThis is what they call the jack. Hi, 
                         Jack!LYNNLaughs.MS. JONESIt goes in that little hole.LYNNLet me do it.

               She plugs the jack in. MS. JONES turns on the radio. LYNN 
               gets a big smile on her face.LYNN(loudly)
                         It's loud!

               She goes to work, playing with the radio, changing stations, 
               etc., oblivious to all else.MS JONESRemoves a Pro Label Machine from 
                         under the seat. She begins to type 
                         in several characters.MR. SMITHLet's get down to business.GENEWho are you? You're not the police.MS. JONESBrilliant.

               MS JONES presses PRINT on the Labeller. A strip of plastic 
               emerges that she begins to apply to a Name Tag.  He looks 
               back to her. MR. SMITH whacks him on the knee with the gun. 
               It hurts.MR. SMITHPay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay 
                         attention and your daughter won't be 
                         hurt.GENEYou wouldn't...MS. JONESTry us.

               He looks back. She is caressing LYNN's hair.GENEGet your hands off her.

               He makes a move. MR. SMITH whacks his knee again, harder.MR. SMITHMr. Watson, you're not paying 
                         attention. Your daughter's life 
                         depends on you. Do you understand 
                         that?

               GENE looks from MR. SMITH to MS. JONES and back. He's having 
               a hard time focussing.

               She slips the NameTag into a manila envelope beside her MR. 
               SMITH Do you understand?GENEYes, yes, I understand.MR. SMITHGood.

               He takes the manila envelope from MS JONES, tosses it in 
               GENE'S lap.MR. SMITHThis is for you. In it there is a 
                         picture of a woman and an itinerary. 
                         It is her itinerary. She is presently - 
                         are you listening, Mr. Watson?GENEYes, I'm listening.MR. SMITHShe is presently at the Bonaventure 
                         Hotel. That's right near here.

               He gestures. GENE looks. The glassy Bonaventure Hotel is 
               glimpsed surrounded by taller, newer high-rises.MR. SMITHWhen you leave this van you will get 
                         yourself a cab and take it to the 
                         Bonaventure Hotel. Then you will 
                         take this.  

               MR. SMITH holds up his hand, snaps his fingers. From the 
               back, MS. JONES hands him a cloth-wrapped bundle. He puts it 
               in GENE's hand, shows him what it is: a gun.MR. SMITH...and you will kill the woman whose 
                         picture is in there. Not just shoot 
                         her, mind,! kill her. I'd recommend 
                         you empty the gun into her. Close 
                         up. Got all that?

               It takes a moment for it all to sink into GENE'S brain.GENEYou're out of your mind.MR. SMITHWhat's your point?GENEI will do no such thing.MR. SMITHYes, you will, Mr. Watson.

               A "snap!" from the back seat. GENE looks. MS. JONES has broken 
               a carrot stick. She breaks another.MS. JONESDon't worry. We'll take good care of 
                         the kid.

               She gives half the carrot stick to LYNN, pops the other half

               Amid the chattering CROWD, GENE is pushed along as if in a

               surroundings, his mind racing, his face a tangle of emotions. 
               He is a man alone in a crowd. He takes a step.

               A LITTLE LATINO GIRL, chased by HER BROTHER, runs into GENE'S 
               legs. He instinctively grabs her before she can fall, finds 
               himself, crouched down, holding her by the arms. His heart 
               plunges - she isn't Lynn. His intensity scares her.LITTLE GIRLMama!

               She pulls away, flees to HER MOTHER, who hoists her up,

               face, pretends to scratch an itch. His other hand taps his 
               wristwatch. GENE's hand slides toward his jacket pocket.

               POLICE OFFICER, plain clothes, badge in pocket, who reacts 
               with a quick laugh.
