              wears a sleep mask.2The bed is a mattress on a makeshift platform.Papers strewn on the floor.An exercise bike.A desk with and old manual typewriter, reference works,
              periodicals, Styrofoam cups.A cast-off sofa with pants, shirts, sweater, underwear and
              socks tossed haphazardly on the cushions and arms.A counter that sets apart the kitchen area. A portable TV set
              on the counter. The remains of dinner for one.A row of stacked cardboard boxes with mail spilling out on
              the floor. Boxes are labeled in crayon: HATE MAIL.A coffee table with a candle nub in a saucer and six gleaming
              rounds of ammunition scattered next to a Llama Comanche .357
              Magnum with a checkered walnut stock -- overall length, nine
              and a quarter inches.A Port-O-San toilet, about seven feet high, orange, scarred
              and dented -- scavenged from a construction site.A snapshot on the bedside table. It's a blurry picture of
              Steven holding a cat. Steven wears a peaked cap, and a shadow
              falls across his face. Next to the picture is a clock radio,
              which comes on with a buzz as the clock shows nine AM.RADIO ANNOUNCER begins to speak --LONE EAGLE (V.O.)(softly)

                          everywhere I look. Cars stop and
                          move and stop again. People sit at
                          the wheel thinking their thoughts.EXT. UNITED NATIONS PLAZA APTS - - MORNING3The shimmering glass facade of the United Nations Plaza
              Apartments at 48th Street and First Avenue. A man visible at

              the air, hailing a cab. He is forty-five, vigorous, wearing
              well-made sporty clothes.In a corner of the screen --OCTOBER 25, 1986INT.

                           peed under the Manhattan bridge.

              size cloth doll. His tape player is on the sidewalk, playing
              and instrumental version of "Beautiful Dreamer" and there is
              a cigar box for donations. A few people look on from a
              distance. The man wearing an old cutaway, with running shoes,
              and the doll has long red tresses and wears a frilly gown.Nicky emerges from a taxi at the corner and walks rapidly
              past the dancing man.Nicky crosses the courtyard to Buchanan Apartments.INT. FOYER7                                                                    7JOANNA BOURNE reaching for the door. Joanna is fifty-ish,

               walls on either side are hung with expensive art.They grapple past the living room. Fleeting look at the
               paintings by Longo and Fischl, a poster by the Guerilla
               Girls.The edge of the bedroom. Nicky is crawling into the room and
               Joanna is hanging on to him, being dragged. They are fully
               dressed except for one of Joanna's shoes.The bedroom. A Lichtenstein, a Hockney, a silk-screen of
               Joanna by Andy Warhol. A Jeff Koons piece. Nicky and Joanna
               roll on the floor until they are halfway under the bed.INT. HALLWAY9                                                                   9Muffled sounds from the bedroom. We track to:The maid's room. The maid is smoking a cigarette and reading
               New York magazine. The cover is partly obscured by her hand
               but we can see a blurry black-and-white photo of a man
               hurrying along a street with a newspaper over his face,
               shielding himself from the camera. Over the photo, three
               words visible: THE PHANTOM WHO -- A second line of type is
               too small to be legible.INT. BEDROOM -- LATER10                                                              10Nicky and Joanna are undressing after the fact, very slowly
               and distractedly. Joanna stands by a chair near the window.
               Nicky is on the other side of the bed and he alternates
               between standing and sitting as he takes off his clothes.JOANNALast night. Alan Albright called me
                         a handsome woman. Second time he's
                         done that. Son of a bitch.NICKYI hear Alan's sick.JOANNAAlan's very sick. He has to go to
                         New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm
                         solution.NICKYYou know about Adele.JOANNAWhat about her?NICKYShe's dying.JOANNAShe died.NICKYI talked to her two days ago.JOANNAApparently it didn't help. You know
          about Peter, of course.NICKYOur Peter?JOANNAPeter Redmond. They found out why
          he can't remember his lines.
          There's something living in his
          brain. A parasite he picked up in
          Borneo, doing the movie.NICKYCan he get through it?JOANNAThey're watching him closely.
          There's a special rehearsal set for
          this afternoon. To bolster his
          confidence. And that's not all.NICKYI've got bigger problems, Joanna.
          Personal problems.JOANNAThat's not all, Nicky. I've been
          backing your plays for fifteen
          years. And I've never been more
          depressed.NICKYAbout what?JOANNASteven Schwimmer. The most powerful
          critic in America gets his first
          crack at Nicky Rogan.6.NICKY(hiding his concern)
                    Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm
                    not worried about this guy.JOANNAEver since he started reviewing the
                    Broadway theater, nobody in this
                    business has been worried about
                    anything else.NICKYThey can send their heartless
                    brilliant boy-critic. There's a
                    much bigger thing going on than
                    tonight's opening.JOANNAWhat?NICKYThe Red SoxJOANNAYou mean the World Series? I
                    thought the Red Sox were winning.NICKYThree games to two. But if you know
                    their history, you realize there's
                    a tragedy in the making. I've been
                    carrying this franchise on my back
                    since I was six years old.JOANNAIt can't be all that personal.Joanna enters the walk-in closet to finish undressing and get
          a nightdress.NICKYIf you have a team you've followed
                    all your life, and they raise your
                    hopes and crush them, and lift them
                    and crush them, do you want me to
                    tell you what it's like? It's like
                    feeling your childhood die over and
                    over.     JJOANNAI mean Nicky, really, no.7.Nicky follows her into the closet, still in his shirt and
          boxer shorts.JOANNAI'm proud of this play. It's so
                    different from anything you've
                    done.NICKYThis is how we've managed to last.JOANNAWe're able to surprise each other.NICKYIn and out of bed.JOANNABecause we're completely
                    mismatched.NICKYWe don't even like each other, do
                    we?Nicky walks out of the closet, takes off his shirt, gets into
          bed.JOANNAI used to tell myself. Talent is
                    more erotic when it's wasted. Will
                    I see you tonight?NICKYThe Red Sox blow a chance to win
                    their first World Series since
                    1918. You expect me to miss that
                    for an opening night?Joanna emerges from the closet in her nightdress and gets
          into bed.JOANNAIt makes me so mad. Steven
                    Schwimmer ready to strike. The
                    exterminating angel.NICKYIt's all worked out. They'll lose
                    tonight. Then they'll lose
                    tomorrow. I see it with stunning
                    clarity.8.JOANNAIt's your best play, Nicky.NICKYThey'll lose because they're my
                           team.JOANNAHe will absolutely hate it.11                                                              11INT. STEVEN SCHWIMMER'S LOFTSteven is just waking up. The radio plays soft music.He reaches over and hits the off button, then activates the
               cassette player. He struggles out of bed and Sufi music
               begins to fill the room.He stands at the foot of the bed, a man in his mid-twenties,
               hollow-chested, slightly potbellied, wearing rumpled pajama
               bottoms and a Mostly Mozart T-shirt.He does not remove the sleep mask.The music has a sensuous, driving beat. Voices begin to
               chant.Steven holds his arms parallel to the floor. Slowly he begins
               to turn, clockwise. The beat picks up and he whirls more
               quickly, his mouth coming open.Now he begins to whirl about the room. The chanting grows in
               intensity. Although he is blindfolded, Steve deftly avoids
               running into furniture and other objects.Steven stops whirling at the precise moment the music stops
               playing. He is back at the foot of the bed, arms stretched
               wide.INT. TAXI12                                                              12Creeping along. Nicky leaning toward the driver.NICKYI wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil.
                           I ate and drove. I had one of those
                           big checkered cabs.DRIVERYou are going where?NICKYCrosstown.9.DRIVERVery bad today.Driver's nameplate --CHOUDHURYRAMASWAMYNICKYI cleaned out the ashtrays

                         traffic. It is one continuous
                         traffic since I arrive. Why must it
                         be?A taxi pulls up alongside. Nicky notices the young woman in
               the rear seat. It is his daughter Laurel. He opens his
               window.NICKYLaurel, stay there.

               overweight, with a pleasant and expressive face. She is
               carrying books in a nylon haversack.NICKYI never see you anymore. Where are
                         you all day?LAURELI go to college. I thought you
                         knew.NICKYDo you want to get some coffee?LAURELI don't drink coffee, Daddy. And

                         talking about.10.NICKYWhat do you want to talk about?
                    I'll talk about anything. What's

                    to the ball game. Do you know that

                    divorce lawyer?NICKYThat's completely crazy.LAURELIs it?NICKYDon't talk like that. How

                         thick-bodied I want to punch you in

               in a cup -- no water.NICKYIf lawyers for the mob are called

               face for protection. Each man has an arm in the air, trying
               to hail a taxi. They are standing near a trash receptacle
               that carries an advertisement for "New York Magazine". It is
               a reproduction of the cover that we'd glimpsed earlier in
               Joanna's apartment when her maid was reading the magazine. A
               furtive man shielding his face with the newspaper -- and a
               headline about a Phantom. Nicky and Elliot do not see the
               receptacle.A bus comes down the street with a large horizontal ad
               covering its right side. It is the same ad -- five of them
               actually, five "New York Magazine" covers side by side.
               Elliot is trying to hail a cab and doesn't notice the ad. As
               the bus bears down, Nicky steps out of the way, removing the
               newspaper from his face and getting a clear look at the five
               photos on the side of the bus -- a man concealing his face
