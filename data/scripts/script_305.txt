CRAZY LOVEWritten byCarol WatsonREVISED 3/10/04FADE IN:INT. BEDROOM - APARTMENT - DAYThe sweet silence of slumber. Suddenly, an alarm clock on a
          nightstand SHRIEKS the operatic tones of Maria Callas.A well-manicured hand, nails painted pink, slaps the snooze
          button and mutes Maria. A few seconds reprieve.Then, another clock, stationed on a dresser, broadcasts the
          FORTISSIMO POUNDING of the "William Tell Overture." Toes,
          also painted pink, swing out of bed and run to the dresser.LETTY MAYER, late 20s and beautiful, turns off the music.
          She opens a dresser drawer and surveys panties that are
          arranged by color, from white to beige to black. Behind the
          panties are rows of bras, also organized by color. Letty
          pulls out some taupe undergarments, checks them against her
          nails and replaces them in favor of a pink bra and panties.Letty goes to her closet and removes a tailored, pink linen
          suit. She lays it on the bed. Beast, her cat, jumps on the
          bed and settles into the jacket. Letty swoops the animal off
          her clothes and brushes cat hair from the suit.LETTYListen, Beast. What have I told
                     you about linen?The scolding is cut short by an "Urge Overkill" song that
          SCREAMS OUT from another room. On cue, Letty heads down the
          hall, dressing as she goes. She CLUCKS for Beast to follow.INT. KITCHEN - SAMELetty turns off the alarm clock that BLASTS "Urge Overkill"
          from the counter and checks the time against her watch.She swings open a cupboard to look at cans of cat food
          arranged by type. Seafood on the left, chicken in the
          middle, then, naturally, beef. Letty reaches for a can.LETTY(looking at Beast)
                     It's liver saute.Letty considers the cat a moment, and chooses another can.LETTYFine, then, chicken in gravy. But
                     you're going to have to eat the
                     liver tomorrow.2.INT. BATHROOM - SAMELetty puts the finishing touches on her make-up and pulls
          back her hair, plastering an errant curl into place with hair
          spray. Yet another alarm clock sounds, this time BLARING the
          voice of shock jocks MARK AND BRIAN.INT. ENTRY HALL - SAMELetty hurries down the hall and turns off the clock, which is
          mounted near the front door. She bends down to kiss the cat
          good-bye, grabs a briefcase and leaves.EXT. HALLWAY - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAYA school bell BUZZES. Grade-schoolers, clutching lunch
          pails, scurry past Letty, who stands outside an office door.
          She straightens her jacket, takes a deep breath and starts to
          turn the handle.Letty is stopped cold when CHANDRA, 7, the victim of a bloody
          nose, runs up to her, bawling.CHANDRAMiss Mayer. Miss Mayer.Letty looks quickly at Chandra, her watch, the door.LETTY(to Chandra)
                    Goodness, this is a bad one.   Tip
                    your head back.She bends down and pushes back Chandra's head. Chandra, off
          balance, places one very bloody hand on Letty's jacket lapel,
          staining it for all eternity.Letty, grimacing, takes the bloody hand firmly in her own and
          guides Chandra down the hall, coaxing the child as she goes.LETTYCome on. Pinch it, Chandra. Pinch

          two other BOARD MEMBERS.Principal Gail glances at the clock. Mrs. Montes taps her

                    and I'm afraid...The door bursts open. Letty stumbles into the room. She
          clutches her briefcase to her chest, trying to cover her
          blood-smeared lapel.LETTYMr. Johansen, hello. I'm so sorry
