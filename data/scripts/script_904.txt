THE PROPOSALWritten byPete ChiarelliJune 16, 2006FADE IN:INT. MARGARET'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNINGThe sun peeks over the horizon.   There's a stunning view of
          Central Park from this apartment, but whoever lives here isn't
          watching.
          As we wander through expensive furniture, a steady THUMP, THUMP,
          THUMP echoes through the apartment.   Eventually, we see MARGARET
          MILLS (37) running on a treadmill, watching "The O.C." on Tivo,
          and reading a manuscript.
          She sprints as the clock on her treadmill goes to zero.   As she
          hits a button to stop the treadmill...INT. WOMAN'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNINGA hand knocks an alarm clock off a table to shut it up.   RICHARD
          PAXTON (26) wakes up on pink sheets and looks around to figure
          out where he is. There are multiple framed pictures of the same
          model on the walls.
          Richard looks at the clock and gets up quickly when he sees it is
          6:16 AM.   Unfortunately for him, he is very hung over.RICHARDWhere are my clothes?
          A blob beneath the sheets next to him answers.   SIMONE is the
          model on the walls and is really, really hot.SIMONEIn the kitchen.   I think.   Can I make you
          some coffee?RICHARDSorry, I gotta go.   I'm late.
          Richard hurries to the kitchen.   Socks are on the butcher block
          next to an empty champagne bottle.   Shoes in the sink.   He finds
          his pants on the floor and puts them on.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Have you seen my belt?
          Simone looks around and sees it tied to her headboard.SIMONEIn here.
          She unties the complicated knot.   Richard comes back half
          dressed.   He swallows a little throwup.RICHARDBaby, I just can't do this anymore.2.INT. MARGARET'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNINGMargaret puts on a black suit jacket.   Definitely not off the
          rack.   She makes sure she looks perfect in the mirror, and moves
          off.INT. WOMAN'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNINGReflected in the mirror above Simone's bed, Richard hurriedly
          gets dressed as he talks.RICHARDYou're just too much for me.   And I'm just
          another guy too wrapped up in his job.SIMONEFine.   Whatever.   Just go.
          Richard sits down on the bed and locks eyes with Simone.RICHARDLet's not end it like that. It's been an
          amazing three and a half weeks.   Thank you.
          And you should know that you have the nicest
          ass I've ever been with.SIMONE(TOUCHED)You mean it?RICHARDI do.   It's magnificent.SIMONEI work really hard on it.RICHARDI know you do.
          Simone smiles and begins to seductively pull the sheets off her
          naked body.   Richard shakes his head "no" and smiles.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          I really gotta go.INT. MARGARET'S KITCHEN - EARLY MORNINGCRUNCH.   Margaret eats a bowl of Kashi and soy milk while
          standing and reading a manuscript.   Her eyes remain glued to her
          reading as she rinses out her bowl and puts it in the dishwasher.
          Her apartment is very quiet.EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MORNINGHONK!   A cab blares its horn at Richard as he runs across the
          street.   His suit is rumpled and he checks his watch.3.INT. MARGARET'S LOBBY - MORNINGDING!   The elevator opens and Margaret strides towards the exit
          and the DOORMAN (60).   Before Margaret gets to the door, her CELL
          PHONE RINGS.   She checks the caller ID and excitedly points at
          her phone as she lets it ring.MARGARET(to phone)
          I knew you would call!   Now come on, tell me
          what I want to hear.   Give it to me.DOORMANYou have to put it by your mouth so people
          can hear you.MARGARETYou should get paid extra for being so darn
          funny.
          Margaret straightens her jacket, answers the phone, and walks out
          the door.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          This is Margaret.INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY - MORNINGRichard bursts into the skyscraper and runs into a Starbucks.INT. STARBUCKS - MORNING - CONTINUOUSTwo coffees lie in wait for Richard.   JILLIAN, a lovely Barista,
          smiles as he hurries to the counter.JILLIANYou're running late today.RICHARDJillian, you are the best.JILLIANIf you think I'm good at this, you should
          use that coffee cup sometime.
          As he runs out the door, Richard glances at his cup and smiles at
          Jillian's name and phone number written in Sharpie.RICHARDSee ya tomorrow.INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY - MORNING - CONTINUOUSThe elevator doors ahead of Richard begin to close.RICHARD4.Mercifully, a hand reaches out and stops the doors.   Inside the
          packed elevator, Richard's CO-WORKERS look sleepy.   One
          particularly frustrated co-worker confronts Richard.CO-WORKER #1How long is she gonna make us come in by
          seven?RICHARDShe doesn't exactly consult with me on these
          things.CO-WORKER #1Well this sucks ass.RICHARDWelcome to my nightmare.
          The doors close as...EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MORNINGMargaret crosses the street and talks on the phone.MARGARETYou've been thinking about our talk because
          I'm right.   Everyone does publicity.   Roth,
          McCourt, Russo.   Hell, Chabon practically
          whores himself.   Know what they have in
          common?   A Pulitzer.
          (off answer)
          Yes, I know you haven't done it in twenty
          years, but that's how long it's been since
          you've written a book this good.INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - MORNINGRichard bursts out of the elevator and passes a clock reading
          6:56 and a sign that announces "Royce Publishing."   He hauls ass
          through a sea of cubicles.   Along the way, grumpy employees
          begrudgingly nod their good mornings.
          At his desk, he pulls a tie out of a drawer and puts it on
          without looking in the mirror.   Noticing his wrinkled suit, he
          pulls out a SPRAY BOTTLE out of the same drawer, sprays it all
          over his body, and then on his head to help mat down a tricky
          cowlick.   Satisfied, he hurries into a nearby corner office.INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY - MORNINGMargaret walks into the lobby and continues talking.   Employees
          avoid her and pile into the elevator.5.MARGARETI'm not pushing so you'll sell more books,
          I'm pushing because it'll be a crime if the
          world doesn't hear that you wrote a genius
          piece of literature.   Do the publicity.
          Margaret waits for an answer and smiles when she hears "yes."
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          You're making the right decision!   Great
          news.   Going into an elevator, think I'm
          going to lose you...
          Margaret hangs up.   Never give them a chance to change their
          mind.INT. MARGARET'S OFFICE - MORNINGRichard races to Margaret's computer and turns it on.   He picks
          up papers strewn about the room.   He goes back to the computer,
          and opens computer programs.INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - RECEPTION - MORNINGMargaret exits the elevator and receives an enthusiastic...RECEPTIONISTGood morning!
          Margaret quickly walks by and gives only the slightest nod.INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - MORNINGMargaret walks through the cubicles and nods hello to her staff,
          who all look busy on the phone.   When she turns the corner, they
          stop their "conversations" in mid sentence and hang up.INT. MARGARET'S OFFICE - MORNINGRichard stares at the printer as a sheet of paper comes out.   A
          clock above the door reads 7:00 AM.   The paper clears the printer
          and Richard grabs it quickly.INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - MORNINGMargaret opens the door to her office, and finds Richard standing
          at attention with papers in one hand and coffee in the other.
          Her office looks perfect.RICHARDYou've got a conference call in thirty, a
          staff meeting at nine, and your immigration
          lawyer sent some papers for you to sign.MARGARETCancel the call, move the meeting to eight,(MORE)6.MARGARET (cont'd)
          (big news)
          I got Frank to do publicity.RICHARDNice job.MARGARETWhen I want your praise, I'll ask for it.
          Is Bob here?RICHARDI'm sure.   You want him on the phone?MARGARETWe're going to his office.   Grab your pad.
          Richard calmly backs out of the office...INT. RICHARD'S DESK - CONTINUOUS... but once he's out of Margaret's sight he runs to his computer
          and sends an instant message to the office "The Banshee is headed
          to Bob's office."INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - MORNINGAs the message pops up on computers, the quiet office jumps to
          life as everyone in a cubicle picks up their phone and resumes
          their imaginary conversations.INT. RICHARD'S DESK - MORNINGMargaret comes out to Richard's desk.   She notices his coffee cup
          with Jillian's number on it.   She takes special notice of the
          hearts that dot the "I's" in Jillian.MARGARETThat's cute.   You gonna call her today?RICHARDWhat?
          Richard doesn't know what Margaret is talking about, until she
          nods at the cup.   He's embarrassed.MARGARETAre you bored here?   Do you need little
          distractions like that to get you through
          the day?RICHARDUh...MARGARETYou have another late night out?RICHARD7.Margaret starts walking.   Richard quickly catches up, worried
          because he doesn't know where she's going with this.MARGARETI'm firing on all cylinders and you've got
          hearts on your coffee cup, wicked bed head,
          and a wrinkled suit that you wore yesterday.RICHARDOh.   Well, it won't be wrinkled for long.MARGARETYou'll magically unwrinkle?RICHARDYes.MARGARETYou have magic pants?RICHARDNo.   I've sprayed them with stuff that will
          take care of the wrinkles.MARGARETDoes this work on more than just your pants?RICHARDAnything that's wrinkled.MARGARETBuy me some.RICHARDWill do.
          Richard makes a note.   Margaret stops to make her point.MARGARETI don't care what or who you do on your own
          time, but when you walk through that door
          you represent me, and I will not have your
          personal life affect you at work.   If you
          want me to think of promoting you to editor,
          I need you sharp, focused and professional.
          Got it?RICHARDGot it.MARGARETGreat.   Now you're just a prop in here, so
          don't say a word.8.INT. BOB'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUSMargaret and Richard enter Bob's office, which is decorated with
          beautiful antiques and first edition books.   But unlike
          Margaret's office, this one isn't in the corner.
          Margaret nods at Richard to shut the door.   BOB (42) wears a prim
          bow tie, circular tortoise shell glasses, and the air of
          superiority.MARGARETHey, Bob.BOBAh.   Our fearless leader and her liege.
          Margaret smiles.MARGARETI'm lettin' you go, Bob.BOBPardon?MARGARETYou're fired.BOBWhat?   What are you talking about?MARGARETThis isn't working out.BOBYou can't...MARGARETI asked you repeatedly to get Frank to do
          publicity.   You said it was impossible.BOBIt is.   He doesn't do publicity.MARGARETI just talked to him.   He's in.BOBBut...MARGARETNo more buts, Bob.   I've been chief for a
          month and a half, and this is the third time
          you've dropped the ball.   You didn't even
          call to ask him.BOB9.MARGARETAll you had to do to was pick up the phone.
          That's it.   Now I'll give you two months to
          find a new job, and then you can say you
          resigned.   I won't tell a soul, my lips are
          sealed.
          Margaret nods at Richard and he opens the door.INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - CONTINUOUSMargaret and Richard walk a few steps.   Margaret looks straight
          ahead and whispers to Richard.MARGARETWhat's he doing?
          Richard turns around and takes a peek.   Bob gets out of his chair
          and comes to his door.RICHARDHe's up and about to pop.MARGARETOh Bob, don't do it...BOBYOU POISONOUS BITCH!   YOU CAN'T FIRE ME!The office stops.   This is going to be good.   Margaret turns
          around with a disappointed look on her face.   She's deadly calm.MARGARETWhat are you doing?   I gave you a civilized
          way out of this.BOBThis is because I'm your competition.
          Because I threaten you!MARGARETOh, Bob.   You could never threaten me.   I'm
          firing you because you're lazy, entitled and
          incompetent.   I'm firing you because you
          don't work hard.   So if you know what's good
          for you, you'll shut up, take off that
          ridiculous bow tie, find a bar and get
          drunk.   Because if you say one more word,
          Richard here is going to call security and
          have you thrown out on your ass.   Are we
          perfectly clear?
          Bob nods.

          schedule figured out pronto.RICHARDNo problem.   I'll just cancel my trip this
          weekend.MARGARETI gave you the weekend off?RICHARDIt was my Grandma's ninetieth birthday.
          But no big deal.   You were right before, I
          need to stay focused.   Professional.INT. RICHARD'S DESK - DAYRichard is on the phone with his mom explaining why he can't come
          home this weekend.   He sounds like an annoyed teenager.RICHARDWell tell gammy that I'm sorry.

          Mom, she's making me work this weekend.
          It's not like I volunteered.
          (waiting to speak)
          I'm sure dad is pissed.
          Margaret comes to Richard's desk.   He tries to wrap it up.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          I have to go.   Yeah.   No, I'm not going to
          do that!   No.   Sorta.   Mom!   No.   Bye.
          Richard hangs up the phone.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Sorry about that.   Damage control.MARGARETShe tell you to quit?RICHARDNo.   No.
          (off Margaret's look)
          Um.   Yes?   But as I've explained to them,
          after three years together, you're the only
          person on the planet who can make me editor,
          so that's the way it is.
          Richard's phone rings and he picks it up.11.RICHARD (cont'd)
          Your 10:55 is here.   Mr. Gilbertson?MARGARETWho is this guy?RICHARDHe said you knew each other.   You weren't
          sure so you told me to set a meeting.   We
          rescheduled on him four times.MARGARETGo get him.   But he's out of here in five
          minutes, we've got work to do.
          Margaret leaves and goes into her office.RICHARD(to himself)
          I'll charge up the cattle prod.INT. MARGARET'S OFFICE - DAYMargaret reads as MR. GILBERTSON (48) sits down.   He's an intense
          man in a bad suit.   He sits in silence until Margaret looks up.MR. GILBERTSONMargaret.   Good to see you.   I know how busy
          you are.   Congrats on the promotion.   Read

          aren't they?   Like everyone who needs to
          know doesn't know already.
          Margaret has been trying to figure out how she knows this man,
          but now gives up.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Have to admit, I can't place where we know
          each other from.
          Gilbertson smiles.   He didn't expect her to remember.MR. GILBERTSONThree years ago?   We worked together.MARGARETDon't have it...MR. GILBERTSONRemember "Dandelion's Desire?"
          Margaret gets excited.12.MARGARETOh my God, you read that manuscript with me?
          That book is legend.   Without a doubt the
          worst ever written.MR. GILBERTSONYou think?MARGARETIt was a fever dream!                                         900 offensive and
          pointless pages, with like 30 characters,
          who all had some weird disability.   The
          paraplegic pornographer, and the stuttering
          scientist?   Oh!   And there was the asthmatic
          alien chapter -- written entirely in his
          alien language.MR. GILBERTSONI believe there was a glossary...
          Margaret laughs, caught up in the memory.MARGARETDid you see the pass letter I wrote him?MR. GILBERTSON(QUOTING)"Your grammar is impeccable, but please do
          not confuse superior form with writing

          A beat.   Margaret says matter of fact...MARGARETYou wrote the book.MR. GILBERTSONI did.MARGARETYou're Dante Dickens?MR. GILBERTSONOne of my nom de plumes.
          Gilbertson paces.   Margaret stays seated, at a loss.MARGARETI'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.   You
          obviously were spending a lot of time
          writing, I just thought you should channel
          all that passion into something else.
          Gilbertson smiles as he pulls a BADGE from his coat pocket.13.MR. GILBERTSONMs. Mills, I'm with U.S. Citizenship and
          Immigration Services, and I'm deporting you
          to Canada.MARGARETExcuse me?   What?   This is a mistake.   I've
          lived here since 1981.   I'm applying for
          citizenship.MR. GILBERTSONYou need citizenship now?   After the big
          promotion?MARGARETYes.   And all the papers are in.
          Gilbertson pulls out a stack of papers and throws them down.MR. GILBERTSONWell, my office is going to reject your
          paperwork on Monday, while we investigate
          whether your behavior is well disposed to
          the good order and happiness of the United
          States.   We must protect our sovereignty.MARGARETI'm a threat to the sovereignty of the
          United States?MR. GILBERTSONYes, and unfortunately my investigation will

          industry if I publish that book.MR. GILBERTSONI'm at the end of my rope, Ms. Mills.   I'm
          an author.   Not some bureaucrat who brings a
          lunchable to work everyday and lives in his
          brother's garage.   You're the last stop, and
          I'm desperate.MARGARETI will never publish your book.   Ever.MR. GILBERTSONThere's no need to make this difficult.   I
          don't turn in your file until Monday...MARGARETThis is blackmail.   I'll go to your boss.MR. GILBERTSONI've spent two years preparing for this day.
          Don't you think I've thought of that?
          Now Margaret is pacing, while Gilbertson happily looks on.
          Suddenly, the door opens and Richard bursts in, acting like there
          is an "emergency" so Margaret can end the meeting.RICHARDExcuse me, Ms. Mills, risk management needs
          you right away.
          The sight of Richard inspires Margaret.   She turns to Gilbertson
          with a wicked grin on her face.15.MARGARETKnow what, Dante?   I'm not going anywhere!
          We're getting married!
          Richard has no idea what Margaret is talking about.RICHARDWho's getting married?MARGARETWe are!RICHARDYou and him?MARGARETStop playing around, honey.
          Margaret is all smiles.   Richard is very confused.

          was marrying the devil woman.MARGARETI thought it was the dragon lady?GEOFFREYEither way.RICHARDHey dad.
          Richard shakes his father's hand.   It's a little stiff.GEOFFREYWelcome home.   Good to see ‘ya.RICHARDYou too.GEOFFREYBeen a while.RICHARDYeah.   You'd think you could make it to the

          Let's get you two settled.
          As Richard and Margaret move towards the house, Annie shoots
          Geoffrey a look that says "be nice".INT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAYThe house is decked out in sheik Alaskan decor.   Somehow, it
          makes bear heads and deer antlers look good.   Everything is first
          class.   Margaret is a little awe struck.DEBBIEWe'll show you around later.MARGARETUh huh.32.Out of nowhere, a small HUSKY PUPPY startles Margaret and jumps
          on her.DEBBIEBalzac!   Down!   No!
          Debbie pulls the dog off of Margaret and pushes him toward the
          kitchen.   Margaret tries to take it in stride and make small
          talk.MARGARETWhat a great name.   Balzac's "Lost
          Illusions" is one of my favorite novels.DEBBIEOh.   Well, this Balzac's got epididymitis.
          Debbie makes two big circles with her pointer fingers to
          illustrate how Balzac really got his name.
          Not understanding, Margaret looks over at Balzac as he walks
          away.   Off her shocked reaction, we understand right away that
          this puppy Husky is an anatomic marvel.

          Richard shrugs his shoulders behind his mother.MARGARETGreat.   You know, I've gotten used to his
          breathing at night.DEBBIEI thought so dear.
          Debbie leaves and shuts the door.   Margaret reverts back to her
          old self.MARGARETI'm about 15 seconds from bitch.RICHARDCalm down.MARGARETWhat is going on here?RICHARDHell if I know.MARGARETYou had no idea they knew about us getting

          only worry about yourself every second of
          every day?MARGARETHow is it selfish to tell the truth?RICHARDLook.   We're awful, awful people.   In the
          last forty eight hours, we've lied to...
          everyone.   We need to protect the people

          decent, not awful people to lie for us.
          Let's keep the darkside to ourselves.
          Margaret takes a second to make up her mind.MARGARETFine.   But if we do this, you need to stop
          lying to me.RICHARDWhat've I lied to you about?MARGARETWhy did you tell me that you were poor?RICHARDI never said that.MARGARETWell, you never told me you were rich.RICHARDWhen does that come up?35.MARGARETI don't know, how about, "Hi, my name is
          Richard, I'm an Alaskan titan of industry."RICHARDWell, maybe I didn't tell you because you
          would have fired me if you knew.MARGARETNo I wouldn't.RICHARDCome on!   You're always yammering on about
          your scrappy childhood, and how you fought
          for those soccer scholarships, and how the
          rich kids made fun of you in prep school for
          working in the kitchen.   You're totally anti-
          rich.MARGARETI'm not anti-rich.RICHARDOh yes you are!   And you know what makes it
          worse?   You have money!MARGARETI earned...RICHARD...every penny I have.   Blah, blah, blah.

          Margaret takes a look at herself in the mirror.MARGARETWell, come on.   If we're going to do this,
          we might as well put on a show.INT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAYDownstairs, the engagement party is in full swing.   The starched
          wait staff stands out in the crowd, because the raucous party-
          goers are all dressed in flannel, T-shirts and baseball hats.36.Ponytails rule for the women, and almost all the men have shaggy
          hair and beards.   No dress code here.
          Like the house, the party is first class.   Ice sculptures melt,
          champagne is served on silver trays, and the buffet overflows
          with salmon and king crab.
          Margaret works the crowd like a pro and holds court with some
          WELL WISHERS, Richard's parents, and Balzac.MARGARETI went to Union college in upstate New York.
          It's a small liberal arts school that no one

          roll over when you whistle?
          Debbie hits Geoffrey.DEBBIEHe's just being a good host.
          Richard comes right back with a waiter in tow.   For Geoffrey's
          benefit, Margaret makes a point to thank Richard.MARGARETThank you, honey.   You're being so sweet.
          Richard is surprised, but remembers they're a couple.RICHARDUh, sure.   Honey.WELL WISHER #2So you just got some big promotion?MARGARETI'm editor in chief, now.

          Richard.
          Everyone turns around to find GERTRUDE THURMAN (26).   She is
          Grace Kelly in Patagonia and Timberland.   Adding insult to
          injury, she doesn't have eyeliner on.RICHARDGert!?
          Richard snaps his arm back, hitting Margaret in the head, and
          spilling her tonic water on her shirt.   He doesn't notice what
          he's done, and leaves Margaret.   She's peeved.
          RICHARD (cont'd)(FLUSTERED)What are you?   What are you doing here?GERTRUDEYour dad made me come.RICHARDFrom Chicago?
          Gertrude laughs.   The group watches these two see each for the
          first time in years.   There is instant chemistry, and Richard has
          forgotten about Margaret completely.GERTRUDENo.   I live here now.RICHARDYou what?GERTRUDEI moved back about six months ago.   I'm
          teaching second grade.   At Baranof.RICHARDDid your husband move up here too?GERTRUDEUh, no.   I, ah, got divorced.RICHARDOh my God.   I'm sorry.GERTRUDEMe too.   But hey, we're being rude, I wanna

          Richard hasn't recovered from seeing Gertrude.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Uh, uh, um, I...GEOFFREYYeah.   How did you pop the question?
          Richard is a deer in the headlights.   This is getting ugly.
          Margaret sees that Richard is going to crumble, and steps in.MARGARETCan I tell this one, honey?40.RICHARDUh.   Sure.MARGARETI'm an early, early riser and go for a run
          everyday.   Well, it was our six month
          anniversary and I was out for my normal jog
          in the park, when who do I see in a horse
          drawn carriage, wearing a tux, and waiting
          for me halfway through my run?   Richard!   So
          I ran up to the carriage and asked him what
          was going on, and he put his finger to his
          lips and says, "shhhh."   So there I am in my
          jogging clothes, next to the most handsome
          mute in the world - have you seen him in a
          tux? - riding like a sweaty princess and
          smiling ear to ear.   Couple minutes later,
          we arrive at Tavern on the Green.   Best
          part, we're the only people in the place
          because Richard got them to open up early.
          Well, we go to our table, sit down, and just
          as the sun starts to peek above the trees,
          this beautiful man gets down on one knee,
          and says "I didn't want one more sunrise to
          go by without you knowing that you are the
          light of my life, and that I would be the
          luckiest man in the world if you would be my
          wife.   Margaret Mary Mills, will you marry
          me?"
          The group is silent, waiting for the clincher.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          I said yes.
          The group gives a collective "ahh".   Grandma Annie takes both
          Margaret and Richard by the hand.GRANDMA ANNIEYou are a good boy Richard, and you make me
          very proud.   I love you Richy.RICHARDI love you too, Grandma.
          Grandma hugs the couple.   Everyone smiles except Geoffrey and
          Gertrude.GEOFFREYSo did this happen before or after the INS
          agent came sniffing around?DEBBIEWhat is wrong with you?   I'm sorry Margaret.
          Margaret doesn't miss a beat.41.MARGARETOh please.   I'd wonder too.   Honestly, my
          lawyers have been dealing with all of this.

          first time I'd heard about it.   I'm so
          embarrassed.DEBBIEDon't be, dear.   Geoffrey's just an ass.
          While Debbie apologizes, Margaret gives Richard a little wink
          that says "I've got this under control".   The moment is
          interrupted when Richard pulls out a RINGING CELL PHONE.   He
          takes a step back and answers quietly so no one can hear.RICHARDMargaret Mill's phone.
          (off answer)
          One second please.
          Richard comes back to the group and hands Margaret the phone.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          It's our friend, Frank.
          Richard's tone let's Margaret know there's a problem.MARGARETExcuse me, I'll just be a second.
          Margaret takes the phone and exits out French glass doors that
          lead to the backyard.   She leaves the door open, and doesn't
          notice Balzac follow her outside.EXT. PAXTON BACKYARD - DAY - CONTINUOUSMargaret goes far from the house so no one can hear.   Balzac
          follows her all the way, but Margaret doesn't see him.MARGARETDon't be a cliche, Frank.   Don't be the
          wishy washy writer who changes his mind
          every two seconds.
          Margaret notices Balzac, but ignores him.   The dog starts YAPPING
          to get attention.   She walks away, but Balzac continues barking.
          Annoyed, she gets down face to face with the puppy and puts the
          phone against her chest so Frank doesn't hear.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          (to Balzac)
          Sit and be quiet!
          Balzac sits and pouts.   Margaret walks away and puts the phone
          back to her ear.42.MARGARET (cont'd)
          I fired Bob because he didn't have your best
          interest in mind.   Our job is to help you
          succeed.   He wasn't doing that.
          Margaret continues to listen to her writer whine, when she
          notices an EAGLE soaring in circles above her and Balzac.   Not
          sure what to think, she looks back at Balzac and sees him
          peacefully sit in the grass.
          She then looks up and sees that the eagle is gone.   Margaret
          shakes her head, looks back at Balzac when --
          WHOOSH!   The eagle snatches Balzac by the scruff of the neck, and
          takes off.   Margaret jumps.
          There is no one to help, so she chases after the dog and eagle.
          She stays calm on the phone.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Could you hold on just a second?
          With no other option, Margaret throws her cell phone and hits the
          eagle suspended 20 feet above her.   The eagle drops Balzac and
          Margaret catches him.   Balzac looks frightened.
          Tucking Balzac away like a furry football, she runs to her phone
          and picks it up.
          MARGARET (cont'd)(NONCHALANT)Sorry, dropped my phone.
          Margaret looks up and sees that the eagle has resumed flying in
          circles above her.   She decides to wrap up the call quick and get
          back to the house.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Frank, I don't want to sell you on anything.
          But know this.   This book is your legacy...
          Margaret looks up and sees the eagle dive towards her and Balzac
          again.   She runs.

          The eagle bears down on them with talons out.   Just as the eagle
          is about to strike, Margaret sticks out her hand with the phone
          to fend back the eagle.   To her surprise, the eagle grabs
          Margaret's phone and flies off.   Margaret freaks.

          The women encourage Hank on as he moves Margaret's hands to his
          wiggling ass and gives her a feel.   She can't help but give and
          embarrassed smile.   Finally, the song ends and Hank goes into the
          splits.   Thrilled, the room gives him a standing ovation.
          Margaret plays along and gives Hank a kiss on the cheek.   She
          begins to get off the stage, but Hank takes her by the hand.45.HANKAh, ah, ah.   I was just the warm up.

          dissolve in the water.MAGUIREHow does she come up with this shit?GEOFFREYShe just does.   I stopped trying to figure
          out how.
          Geoffrey and Mr. Maguire see Richard coming their way.   Mr.
          Maguire yells at Richard like the old family friend he is.MAGUIRE(JOKING)I'm mad at you, son!RICHARDWhy's that, Mr. Maguire?MAGUIREYou fly up here and don't call me?RICHARDSorry ‘bout that.MAGUIREWhat good is me owning an airline if I can't
          give you free tickets?RICHARDYou're right.   Don't know what I was
          thinking...MAGUIREDamn, straight.   Don't let it happen again!
          (hands Richard a golf club)
          Here, you take over.   This game is for
          pussies, I'm getting a drink.
          Mr. Maguire leaves, and Richard and Geoffrey are left alone with
          one another for the first time.   Things are awkward between
          father and son, and Richard begins hitting balls to avoid
          conversation.   Geoffrey finally makes small talk.47.GEOFFREYMaguire's stepping down in January.   He's,
          uh, handing things over to Matty.
          Richard gives his dad a look.   He knows where this is going.RICHARDThat's great for them.GEOFFREYSo.   How's work with you?RICHARDGood.   Busy.   You know.GEOFFREYI do.   I do.   Hey, did I tell you that we're
          opening a little office in Japan?RICHARDCongratulations.GEOFFREYWe're not just a mom and pop operation
          anymore.   We're going global.RICHARDUh-huh.
          Geoffrey stops hitting golf balls for a second.   He's been
          thinking about this moment for a long time.GEOFFREYI could really use your help.RICHARDDad.   Please.   I'm in New York.   Margaret's
          in New York.   We have jobs.GEOFFREYI know.   I know.   It's just...RICHARD(CHALLENGING)It's just what?GEOFFREYYou're only a secretary.
          This pisses Richard off immediately.RICHARDAgain with the secretary thing!   I've told
          you, I'm an assistant!48.GEOFFREYJust because you call yourself an
          "assistant" doesn't mean you're not really
          just a secretary.RICHARDWell if I'm "just a secretary", why would
          you want me up here anyway?   Sounds like
          you're doing great without me.GEOFFREYIt's not like that and you know it.RICHARDThen how is it?   Explain it to me.
          Geoffrey looks around to see if anyone is listening.GEOFFREYLast week, a man stuck his finger up my
          butt...RICHARDThis man was a doctor?GEOFFREY...and it got me thinking about you.RICHARDI'm not sure this is coming out right.GEOFFREYJust shut up for a second, okay?   I want you
          to have what I built.   But I'm running out
          of time to show you things.RICHARDStop being so dramatic.GEOFFREYI'm not being...
          (takes a hard line)
          I need you to stop dicking around down there
          and get serious.RICHARDSo this is all about what you want?GEOFFREYThat's not what I said.RICHARDAnd me in New York with Margaret?   That
          isn't serious?49.GEOFFREYOne day the woman is the Antichrist, and the
          next day she's the love of your life?   How
          is that serious?RICHARDThings change, dad.GEOFFREY(INDIGNANT)Things change?RICHARDThings change.GEOFFREYThings change?RICHARDYes.   Things change.GEOFFREYThings change.   That's your explanation?
          Know what I think?   I think you banged your
          boss and fell in love, that's what I think.
          Some sorta mommy complex.RICHARDNice, dad.   We gotta have these Cosby
          moments more often.   This is great.
          Richard drops his club and walks back to the house.EXT. PIONEER BAR - DAYMargaret steps outside to have a moment to herself.   She's on a
          patio overlooking the ocean.   It is late, but the sun is hanging
          just over the horizon.GERTRUDEThey can be a little overwhelming, but
          they're great people.MARGARETWhat?   I'm just working on my tan.
          (off Gertrude's look)
          It's been a long day.
          Margaret looks inside and sees that the party is still raging.GERTRUDEAround the solstice they don't watch the
          clock.   Pretty much party ‘til they fall
          over.MARGARET50.GERTRUDEI actually missed it when I was in the

          it.   Think I'm back for good.MARGARETReally?   I don't know.   Don't you miss...GERTRUDENeimans?   Starbucks?   Escalators?
          Margaret laughs.   She likes this woman.
          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          Yeah.   I miss it.   Believe me, growing up I
          never thought I'd end up divorced and back
          here teaching at my old elementary school.
          That was always Richard's plan.MARGARETFor you to get divorced?GERTRUDE(smiles, remembering)
          No.   I was going to teach, he was going to
          run his dad's business.   He was like a
          little old man.   Had it all worked out.MARGARETAre we talking about the same guy?GERTRUDEWhat do you mean?MARGARETWell, Richard's such a player.
          Gertrude looks confused.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          I mean he was a total player.   Before we
          started dating.   Six months ago.GERTRUDE51.MARGARETThat surprises you?GERTRUDEDid he ever tell you why we broke up?MARGARETWe don't really talk much about stuff like
          that.GERTRUDEOh.   Well I should shut up...MARGARETNo, no.   Please.   I mean, we are getting
          married.   I want to know these things.
          Gertrude looks down a little embarrassed.GERTRUDEHe proposed to me.   When we were seniors.
          Margaret laughs.MARGARETI'm sorry.   I didn't mean to...   He proposed
          to you in high school?GERTRUDEHe bought this sweet little ring, and got
          down on his knee.   It was so cute.MARGARETYou must have...GERTRUDE... freaked out?   Oh you bet.   I broke up
          with him on the spot.MARGARETI would hope so.GERTRUDEAfter getting rejected the first time, I
          can't imagine how hard it was for him to get
          up the courage to ask you.
          Margaret just smiles, feeling guilty about lying when Gertrude is
          being so honest with her.
          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          Anyway.   The idea that my little old man
          could be a player...   It's just not the
          Richard I knew.   Good thing you're making an
          honest man of him again.52.Gertrude toasts Margaret and knocks back the rest of her beer in
          one swig.   She has a hard time finishing it off.
          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          Well I'm empty.   I'm going to go get
          another.   I think I hear Ramone wrapping up,
          let's get back to the girls.MARGARETI'll be right in.
          Margaret smiles and turns to the ocean.   Gertrude goes inside.
          Then, to herself, Margaret silently whispers.

          quickly place another log down and THWACK!   We pull back to find
          Richard playing the role of executioner.   He's still mad after
          talking to his dad, and is taking it out on the firewood.   Rage
          Against the Machine plays on his iPod and he's in his own world.
          Behind him, the girls return to the island on the family yacht.
          Their mood is light, and they chat amongst themselves.   Debbie's
          mood deflates when she sees Richard.DEBBIE(SHOUTING)Richard!   Honey!   Is everything OK?
          With his back to the girls and the iPod on, Richard doesn't hear
          or see the girls.
          Annie shakes her head.   Something is up.INT. PAXTON ESTATE FAMILY ROOM - DAYGeoffrey pets Balzac as he watches SportsCenter on a sixty inch
          plasma television.   The ladies arrive and Annie and Debbie step
          in front of the TV, blocking his view.   Margaret watches from the
          door, not sure what is going on.GEOFFREYExcuse me?   I'm watching that.ANNIEWhy is Richard chopping wood?DEBBIEAnd don't play dumb.   What did you do?
          Geoffrey is uncomfortable answering in front of Margaret.53.GEOFFREYNothing.   I didn't do anything... will you
          please move.
          The showdown intensifies.   Margaret excuses herself.MARGARETI am so tired.
          Balzac GROWLS when he hears Margaret's voice.   He's still mad.
          Margaret just smiles.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Think I'm going to take a shower and clean
          off Ramone's bubble gum body oil. Thanks for
          a great night.
          Annie and Debbie smile graciously and wish her good night.   Once
          she's gone, they turn their death stare back to Geoffrey.   He
          looks genuinely unnerved.GEOFFREYStop looking at me like that!EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAYRichard continues to listen to his iPod, and has worked up quite
          a sweat.     He's stacks the last log, takes off his soaked through
          shirt, and gets a whiff of himself.   Ew.   He stinks.INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAYMargaret walks into the private bathroom attached to her room and
          shuts the door.   We hear her turn on the shower.INT. PAXTON ESTATE FAMILY ROOM - DAYGeoffrey defends himself to Debbie and Annie with great
          conviction.   Richard walks right by the fighting trio, but
          doesn't notice anyone.   He continues to listen to his iPod and
          his attention is focused on the controls, as he looks for the
          playlist "Songs I Shouldn't Like" and Charlene's hit "I've Been
          to Paradise, But I Haven't Been to Me."INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAYIN THE BATHROOMMargaret turns off the shower, pulls back the curtain and reaches
          for a towel.   All she finds is a miniature unabsorbent decorative
          hand towel.   Shit.IN THE BEDROOMRichard enters the room smiling as Charlene sings "...I've been
          undressed by kings and I've seen some things that a woman ain't54.IN THE BATHROOMMargaret's ears perk up.   The bathroom is a disaster because she
          has dripped water everywhere looking for a towel.MARGARETRichard, is that you?IN THE BEDROOMRichard opens the armoire next to the bed and pulls out an
          incredibly absorbent Egyptian cotton towel.IN THE BATHROOMMargaret cracks the door open to see what the sound was.   Richard
          isn't there, but she sees the armoire open and the towels waiting
          for her.   How did she miss that?MARGARETRichard, are you...
          Then out of nowhere, Balzac (he followed Richard in) startles
          Margaret.BALZACYap, yap, yap, yap, yap!
          Margaret slips on the wet floor and falls on her ass.   Her foot
          kicks the door open as she retreats from the vengeful puppy.ON THE BEDROOM'S DECKRichard is oblivious as he hangs his wet clothes over a rail on
          the deck attached to the room.   He makes sure that no one is in
          the yard, pulls down his shorts, and hangs them up as well.IN THE BATHROOMNaked, wet, and starting to get a little pissed off, Margaret
          manages to pull herself up by the toilet.   She wants a towel
          badly, but Balzac guards the doorway.   She tries reason.MARGARETI'm sorry bout the eagle.   But I saved you.
          Balzac won't listen to reason and barks angrily.   Margaret grabs
          the ceramic top of the toilet tank to protect herself.ON THE BEDROOM DECKRichard calmly turns around and sees that the bathroom door is
          open.   That's weird.55.IN THE BATHROOMMargaret holds the top of the toilet tank like a baseball bat,
          ready to strike.   Balzac will not be intimidated, and continues
          to growl and not let her out of the bathroom.   Margaret knows
          that she can't hit a dog, and looks for another way out.   Then
          she spots the bathroom mat.IN THE BEDROOMRichard saunters towards the bathroom, wearing only his iPod.IN THE BATHROOMBalzac puts a paw onto the bath mat.
          Margaret slowly puts back the toilet top.
          Balzac gets to the center of the bath mat, and Margaret pulls
          hard, sliding the bath mat and Balzac to the back of the
          bathroom.   With Balzac out of the way, she runs out, closes the
          door behind her and...IN THE BEDROOMWHAM!   Margaret crashes into Richard and they fall to the floor.
          It takes a second for them to realize that they are holding each
          other buck naked.MARGARET                                                             RICHARDAaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!                                        Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
          The two quickly separate and spastically try to cover up.   A
          rapid fire back and forth ensues.MARGARET                                                             RICHARDWhy are you naked?

You're blaming the dog again?MARGARETWill you just hand me a towel!
          Richard looks for a towel, but forgets he's naked.   When he looks
          under the bed, Margaret shrieks and covers her eyes..
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          You're flashing brain!
          Richard quickly changes positions.   Out of desperation, he pulls
          the entire comforter off the bed.   He throws it Margaret's way,
          and she wraps herself in it.56.MARGARET (cont'd)
          You can cover up any time!
          Richard cups the beans and franks and backs up to his clothes by
          the window.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Explain yourself!RICHARDI didn't know you were home!   I was outside
          chopping wood!MARGARETYou didn't hear me?RICHARDI had my iPod on!(CONFUSED)Why did you jump me?
          Richard reaches his clothes and pulls on his shorts.MARGARETI didn't jump you.
          (off Richard's look)
          I didn't mean to jump you.   I didn't know
          you were here.RICHARDYou didn't see me?MARGARETI was running from the dog!
          Richard looks at Margaret suspiciously.RICHARDWait.   Were you tryin' to seduce me?MARGARETOh please!   Don't flatter yourself.RICHARDMmm-Hmmm.MARGARETGo take a shower.   You stink.RICHARDFine.   But don't come sneaking in there.
          You're still my boss.   That'd be sexual
          harassment.57.Richard goes to the bathroom and shuts the door.   Margaret takes
          a breath, but is startled when the door suddenly opens back up
          again.   Richard has Balzac cradled in his arms and scratches his
          neck.   He gently puts him outside their room.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          There you go, buddy.   Go on and play before
          she makes a coat out of you.
          Richard shuts the door and goes into the bathroom.   Without
          looking back, Richard gets the final shot.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Puppy hater.LATERRichard grabs all the pillows, cushions and blankets he can find
          to create himself makeshift bed on the floor.
          Margaret turns out the lights, leaving the room still bright with
          the sun still shining outside.   She gets into her bed.MARGARETI'm never gonna to get to sleep.
          Richard pushes a button and motorized metal blinds come down
          outside the window.   The sunlight is instantly blocked out and
          the room is pitch black.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Oh.   Well.   Thanks.
          Richard settles into his pathetic excuse for a bed.   The two
          silently lie awake and stare at the dark ceiling.RICHARDIt was kinda weird seeing you naked.MARGARETCan we not talk about this?RICHARDI'm just saying.   It was weird.MARGARETIt wasn't weird.RICHARDHow was that not weird?MARGARETBecause we're... like teammates.RICHARDWe're like teammates?58.MARGARETWe are teammates.   And teammates see each
          other naked in the locker room.   All the
          time.   It's not a big deal.RICHARDWell, if we're teammates can I sleep in the
          bed?MARGARETGood night, Richard.
          The two lay awake in silence for another beat.RICHARDMargaret?MARGARETYes?RICHARDDon't take this the wrong way.MARGARETOkay...RICHARDYou're a very beautiful woman.
          Margaret smiles with her head turned away from Richard.MARGARETGet some sleep Richard, big day tomorrow.INT. PAXTON ESTATE - OFFICE - DAYNot a creature is stirring, except for Geoffrey who creeps into
          his office.   He shuts the door softly and goes to his gigantic
          oak desk.   He finds a phone number with a New York City area code
          on a piece of paper.   He dials.GEOFFREYYes.   Mr. Gilbertson?   My name is Geoffrey
          Paxton...
          Only the animal trophies that adorn Geoffrey's office hear the
          rest of the conversation.INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAYMargaret wakes up.   She looks over to Richard asleep on the floor
          with a blanket and a pillow.   She stares maybe a beat too long,
          before there is a KNOCK on the door.MARGARETWho is it?59.DEBBIE (O.S.)It's me dear.   I made you two breakfast in
          bed.   Can I come in?MARGARET(STALLING)Uh, sure.   Just a second.
          Margaret can't yell at Richard, so she throws a model wooden
          sailboat to wake him up.   She hits him in the head.RICHARDWhat the...MARGARET(MOUTHING)Your mother.
          Richard jumps up and replaces cushions and hides signs of his
          makeshift bed.   He finishes quickly, hops in the bed, and puts
          his arm around Margaret.RICHARDCome on in mom!
          Debbie enters with a tray of pastries, fruit and coffee.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Ah mom, you made your cinnamon rolls.DEBBIEWell, it's your special day.
          Debbie smiles, puts down the tray on a bedside table and sits on
          the edge of the bed.   She is buzzing with excitement.
          DEBBIE (cont'd)
          You two need your energy, so eat up.   We've
          got your dress fitting, have to get the
          house ready, and then your wedding.RICHARDI gotta run into town to get Margaret a new
          phone.DEBBIEWill you pick up some champagne while you're
          there?RICHARDNo problem.DEBBIEAnd don't be gone for too long.   Lots of
          work to be done!60.MARGARETYou don't have to go to all this trouble.
          Really.
          Debbie sweetly looks back at Margaret.DEBBIEDon't be silly.   This is the biggest day of
          your life.   You are coming into this family,
          and when it's family, it's no trouble.   If
          your parents were with us, they would do the
          exact same.
          Debbie leaves and Margaret smiles as the door closes.   Richard
          jumps out of bed and goes to the food.MARGARET(TOUCHED)Your mom is just so sweet.   I haven't had
          someone make me breakfast in bed since I was
          a little kid.
          Richard takes a huge bite of cinnamon roll.RICHARD(mouth full)
          I wish she hadn't.   I mean she almost caught
          us.   Damn, that was close.
          Like a pig in shit, Richard continues to dig in and doesn't pay
          attention to Margaret.MARGARETYou just take all this for granted?   Your
          family, this house...
          Richard takes another big bite and turns to Margaret.RICHARD(mouth full)
          I'm sorry, what?   You gotta try these.
          Margaret looks at Richard with disgust.MARGARETWhy are you doing this to them?RICHARDHuh?MARGARETWhy am I here?   You didn't have to bring me
          here.RICHARDYou made me bring you here!   You told me I61.MARGARETI didn't make you do anything.   You could of
          said no.RICHARDAnd what?   Start over at the bottom again?
          No way.MARGARETI get why a not rich person would do this.
          But you've got everything.   It doesn't make
          any sense.RICHARDKnow what?   This is none of your business.MARGARETI wish it wasn't my business.   But
          unfortunately, it has become my business,

          I could trust.

          you why you're here.MARGARETFine.RICHARDWe leave in a half hour.MARGARETI'll be ready in 20 minutes.
          Margaret angrily takes a bite of a cinnamon roll and slams it
          down on the plate.   She goes to her suitcase and looks for
          clothes.   A beat passes, and she comes back to the rolls.

          and running shoes.EXT. BOAT - DAYRichard drives the yacht and Margaret sits by herself.62.EXT. PAXTON SEAFOODS PIER - DAYRichard docks the boat at the Paxton Seafood pier.   Located in
          the town's harbor, the packing plant consists of three large
          warehouses, and buzzes with activity.   Fishing boats line the
          pier, unload their fish, and forklifts take the fish to be
          processed.   Everything is clean and organized.
          Richard and Margaret walk down the pier.   He points to the SEALS
          that swim everywhere and eat fish scraps.   Damn, they're cute.
          Richard waves hello to WORKERS.   An elderly Phillipino man, BEK
          BEK, yells at them as he walks into a warehouse.BEK BEKHey, Richard!   That the lucky lady?RICHARDYes sir, it is!BEK BEK(to Margaret)

          wearing large green hip waders with suspenders, rubber fishing
          boots, and gloves.MARGARETIs this really necessary?RICHARDYou'll thank me later.
          Richard walks towards the warehouse.   Margaret follows in her63.INT. SLIME LINE - DAYInside one of the brightly lit warehouses, workers at different
          stations process the fish that come off the boats.
          At the top of the line, Bek Bek is HANDCUFFED to the head
          decapitator machine.   He happily feeds whole salmon into a
          guillotine, where the heads are chopped off.   He awkwardly waves
          when he sees Margaret and Richard.MARGARETWhy is he handcuffed to the machine?RICHARDSo his hands don't go too far.   So he
          doesn't...
          Richard makes a chopping motion.   Margaret winces.MARGARETNice.
          From the decapitator, fish are fed into the gut puller, where
          their bellies are slit and the intestines are pulled out.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          You know, I shouldn't be here.   I was a
          vegetarian for six months in college.
          Richard leads Margaret to the end of slime line, where a long
          line of 20 workers give the fish a final cleaning before they are
          frozen.   With great speed, they take the fish from the gut puller
          line and clean out all the left over intestines.WORKERThere he is!   Big city boy come to show us
          how its done.RICHARDAh, it's been a while.WORKERC'mon.   Show her how we do it.RICHARDOkay, okay.
          Richard and Margaret go to the end of the line.   Richard expertly
          demonstrates with a knife.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          You grab a fish, but be gentle, cause you
          don't want to bruise it.   Open her up, tilt
          the knife, and then pull with the grain of
          the fish.   Two quick stokes to clear the
          organs attached to the spine.64.Margaret looks nauseous.   Richard enjoys her discomfort.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Then use the tip of the knife to squeeze the
          blood out of the vein.   Then send her down
          the line.
          Richard guts another fish with precision and speed before
          offering a knife to Margaret.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Wanna try it?
          Margaret doesn't say anything.   All the other workers watch.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          If it's too gross for you...MARGARETGimme that.
          Up to the challenge, she takes the knife and grabs a fish.
          Margaret puts the knife in and keeps as much distance as possible
          between her and the salmon.RICHARDI did this for five summers.   Dad wanted me
          to earn my stripes before I took over.MARGARETIs that why you're still pissed at him?RICHARDNah, I loved it here.MARGARET(re: fish guts)
          You loved this?RICHARDThe slime line?   Hell no.   Nobody loves the
          slime line.   I loved this place.   The
          people.   Growing up, running this place was
          all I wanted.
          Margaret scrapes a huge glop of guts out of a fish.MARGARET(DISGUSTED)You wanted this?RICHARDI wanted to run this place. It was
          comfortable here.   It was what I knew.
          (re: fish)
          Don't forget the spine.65.MARGARETI wasn't gonna forget.
          Margaret squeezes the blood out of the vein, sends the fish on
          its way, and grabs another fish with more confidence.RICHARDBut then things changed.   And it wasn't so
          comfortable anymore.MARGARETWhat kind of things changed?RICHARDStuff.MARGARET(as if she didn't know)
          You mean, like, Gertrude?RICHARDYeah...

          Richard is embarrassed.   He turns away.RICHARDAbout the... you know.MARGARETThe creepy teenage proposal?RICHARDAh, shit!MARGARETYou were a freak by the way.RICHARDOK, get it all out.MARGARETAnd she was right to break up with you.RICHARDYou done?
          Margaret nods yes.66.RICHARD (cont'd)
          I know now that it was the right thing, but
          it screwed me up for a little while.MARGARETFor a little while?   Don't sell yourself
          short.RICHARDWhen Gert crushed my heart into little
          pieces, a life up here didn't seem so great
          anymore.MARGARETSo you moved to the open arms of New York
          City?RICHARDAt first it was about getting as far away
          from this place as possible, but then I fell
          in love with it.MARGARETWith scheduling my pilates?RICHARDWith editing.   See, as an only kid I'd
          always read a lot, but until I worked for
          you I didn't love it.   I mean, when I
          realized that we could find the next

          Mockingbird.   God damn, how great is that?
          Margaret smiles.   She never knew that Richard had this kind of
          passion for the job.

          Yeah.   That was it.   You know, I can do
          this.   You should really go try on the dress
          for my mom.MARGARETI was going to go for a run first, it's been
          three days since I got out, I'm feeling
          crazy.RICHARD(could care less)
          Whatever.
          Margaret isn't accustomed to Richard talking to her this way, but
          doesn't push it.79.EXT. PAXTON TRAIL - DAYMargaret runs at a fast pace deep in the woods.   She's running
          hard, muttering to herself, and working out the aggression she's
          accumulated over the last thirty six hours.   She's lost in her
          own world, until she sees smoke, and slows to a stop.MARGARETWhat now?
          Margaret follows the smoke, and hears a mysterious DRUMBEAT.   She
          soon discovers a tremendous bonfire by the water, and a SHAMAN
          dancing around it.   He is dressed in a loin cloth, and wears a
          carved bear's head mask and tribal make up.   His belly shakes as
          he spastically moves around the fire. The Shaman sings a song
          that sounds centuries old.SHAMANYai...takuju magaluam Ut uksu lingm ik

          Margaret hides behind a tree and stares at this man in a trance.
          He begins to yell at the fire and scream at the top of his lungs.
          Exhausted, he stops and catches his breath.   He yells out again.
          SHAMAN (cont'd)
          Margaret, welcome!
          She looks around.   Maybe another Margaret is in the vicinity.
          SHAMAN (cont'd)
          Come to me, Margaret of New York.
          Nope, that's her.   She carefully steps out into the clearing.
          SHAMAN (cont'd)
          It is I, father Paxton.
          Sure enough, Geoffrey is beneath all the make-up.MARGARETWhat, ah, are you doing?GEOFFREYMy shaman Kevin told me to get out here and
          clear my head.   As you know, things have
          been a little crazy around here.   You should
          join me.MARGARETYa know, I've got to get back.GEOFFREYYou closed minded southerners amuse me.
          Never willing to leave the nest and try80.MARGARETI'm a big fan of the nest.
          Geoffrey throws sand into the fire and it blazes higher.GEOFFREYDance with me!   You besmirch my ways if you
          deny my circle.
          Worried she's going to really piss him off, Margaret relents.MARGARETOK, OK.   I "accept your circle."
          Geoffrey smiles and throws more sand into the fire.GEOFFREYClear your mind and follow me.
          Geoffrey begins dancing slowly, contorting his body.   Margaret
          follows, always a half step behind, and can't get into it.   After
          a few moments, Margaret stops.MARGARETI'm gonna head back.GEOFFREYWe're not done.MARGARETI think I am.
          Margaret begins to leave.   Geoffrey calls after her.GEOFFREYMargaret?
          Margaret stops and turns around.
          GEOFFREY (cont'd)
          I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot.   But
          I'm making an effort here.   Don't leave now.
          Much to her chagrin, Margaret stays.   Geoffrey is pleased.

          Geoffrey throws more sand on the fire to make it go higher and
          speeds up the dance.   Margaret is getting better, but it is still
          painfully awkward.81.GEOFFREY (cont'd)

          way.   You'll feel better.MARGARETI can't...GEOFFREYClose your eyes.   Chant.
          Margaret and Geoffrey keep dancing.   Margaret closes her eyes,
          but can't figure out what to say.

          Chant!MARGARETI don't know any chants!GEOFFREYChant!MARGARET(GUTTERAL)Toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...
          Looking at Margaret, it's surprising she can make such a low
          noise.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ...ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...GEOFFREYChant!
          The drum beat continues.MARGARET82.They continue to dance, Margaret is getting into it.

          Geoffrey stops dancing.   What did she say?
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ...to all these bitches crawl...
          Margaret's eyes are closed, she doesn't realize that she's broken
          out into a ‘Lil John song.   She continues to dance.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ...To all skee skee motherfucker...
          Geoffrey takes the bear head mask off.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ...all skee skee got damn...
          From the trees, the moment is broken when Debbie shouts out.DEBBIEGeoffrey!
          Margaret stops chanting ‘Lil John.GEOFFREYOh Debbie, I didn't do anything.
          Margaret sees Debbie and Grandma Annie in the clearing.GRANDMA ANNIEIs she singing about balls?MARGARETHe told me I had to chant!GRANDMA ANNIEOh, you poor dear.   Geoffrey, you can't do
          this!

          up.   You've got a dress to try on.   And
          Geoffrey, put that fire out and come in and
          help us with this wedding.
          Geoffrey turns off the boom box that was hidden in the trees and
          the drum beat stops.GEOFFREYFine.
          With a fire extinguisher, the bonfire comes to an end.INT. PAXTON MASTER BEDROOM - DAYDebbie and Annie wait outside a bathroom door in a massive master
          bedroom.   They talk to Margaret through the door.DEBBIEI am so excited.   Aren't you excited?GRANDMA ANNIEThis was my dress from 1929.   My mother made
          it by hand.   Amazing how things come back
          into style.   How does it fit?
          Margaret speaks through the door.MARGARET (O.S.)Just buttoning up here.GRANDMA ANNIEDrum roll!
          Grandma and Debbie enthusiastically make drum roll sounds.
          Margaret opens the door and smiles.   She's unsure of herself, but
          looks fantastic.   The dress fits great, except...
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          Your boobs are bigger than mine ever were.MARGARETYeah, it's a little snug.DEBBIECome over here.
          Debbie leads Margaret to a mirror.   Grandma Annie follows.84.MARGARET(ADMITTING)It's a lovely dress.
          Debbie looks at Margaret, and spontaneously begins crying.DEBBIE(through the tears)
          You're so beautiful, and such a great match
          for my Richard.   I know I've just met you,
          but a mother can tell.   When he looks at
          you, I can tell he's in love.   I'm so happy
          I get to share your day.GRANDMA ANNIEDebbie, please.   We've got work to do.DEBBIEYou're right.
          Debbie collects herself, then starts crying again.GRANDMA ANNIEYou go work downstairs, I'll finish this.
          Debbie tries to calm down, but can't.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          Go!
          Debbie nods in agreement.   Smiling from ear to ear, she leaves in
          tears.   Margaret and Annie watch her go.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          Had to get rid of her before I gave you
          this.   Don't think she woulda recovered.
          Grandma Annie comes from behind and puts her arms around
          Margaret's neck.   When she is done, a stunning blue necklace lays
          on Margaret's neck.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          You needed something blue.   It's silly, but
          I didn't want to take any chances.MARGARETIt's beautiful.GRANDMA ANNIEIt's hematite.   Alaska diamonds.   The blue
          ones like this are very rare.   My great
          grandfather gave it to my great grandmother
          when they were married.   They were quite a
          scandal, you know.   He was Russian and she
          was Tlingit.(MORE)85.GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          Back then, you had to get approval from
          every person in the tribe before you got
          married.   It almost broke them up.MARGARETHow'd they stay together?GRANDMA ANNIEDon't know.   But I'm sure happy they did,
          none of us would be here if they hadn't.
          Grandma and Margaret admire the necklace in the mirror.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          I want you to have it.
          This is awful news for Margaret.   She might as well be stealing
          from Annie.MARGARETNo, no, no.   I can't.   Really.GRANDMA ANNIEI don't want to hear it.   It's yours.
          Grandmothers like to give their stuff away
          to their grandchildren.   Makes us feel like
          we'll always be a part of your life, even
          after we're gone. Take it.
          Margaret puts her hand to the necklace, and for the first time
          feels like a complete and total fraud.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          Are you feeling all right, dear?
          Margaret doesn't speak.   Annie patiently waits for her reply.MARGARETWell.   Thing is...
          Margaret deliberates spilling her guts to Annie, but can't.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ...the dress is just a little tight.GRANDMA ANNIEOh, don't worry about that.   We've got these
          seams by the arm, this'll be easy.
          Annie marks up the dress with tailor's chalk.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          We can fix this no problem.
          Margaret smiles, but knows that Annie couldn't be more wrong.86.EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAYRichard helps WORKERS build a stage for the band.   He's still in
          a foul mood when Margaret interrupts in a panic.MARGARETWe need to talk.RICHARDI'm a little busy.MARGARETWell I'm freaking out.   I need to get away
          from here.   From everyone.   Now.RICHARDGo for another run.MARGARETNo!   I did that.   It did not help.RICHARDI'm a little tired of you making demands and
          me just jumping...MARGARET(re: wedding stuff)
          We're not going to need any of this if I
          don't get out of here.RICHARDOK, high maintenance.   Let's go.EXT. PAXTON SPEED BOAT - DAYUnlike the bulky yacht, this boat is built for speed and
          maneuverability. Richard starts her up.MARGARETMove over, I'm driving.
          Margaret cuts in front of Richard and grabs the wheel.RICHARDYou don't know where we're going.
          Margaret opens up the throttle and they are off.MARGARETIt doesn't matter.ON THE OPEN OCEANMargaret and Richard leave everyone behind and take off for the
          horizon.87.As they jet up the coast away from civilization, the green trees,
          blue water and wildlife (bears, puffins, moose) that inhabit the
          coastline have a calming effect on both of them.   In Alaska, it
          doesn't take long to leave humanity behind.
          Eventually, the boat travels through a channel with steep
          mountain walls on either side.   Although it is still warm out, an
          icy beach can be seen straight ahead.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Where are we?RICHARDThe north pole.   Congratulations, we made
          it.
          (off Margaret's look)
          It's a glacier.   Tracy's Arm.   You better
          let me take it from here.MARGARETI'm fine.RICHARDOh.   OK.   So like me, you've navigated a lot
          of glacier fields?   And not died?
          Margaret reluctantly moves aside and lets Richard steer.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Lady, you've got issues.MARGARETYeah.   I'm a control freak.   Fine.RICHARDIt doesn't stop there.MARGARETThis coming from the sociopath.RICHARDOh, please.MARGARETI'd never bring me here.RICHARDYou drove!MARGARETI mean to Alaska.RICHARDAre you kidding me?
          Richard pulls next to the glacier and turns off the engine.88.MARGARETYou're sick.   Doing this to them.RICHARDI explained to you...MARGARETThey love you.   Do you get that?RICHARDOf course.MARGARETAnd you're still willing to lie to them?RICHARDLike you didn't know.MARGARETDidn't know what?RICHARDThat we were going to lie to them.MARGARETI didn't know!RICHARDWell that makes you either stupid, or
          ignorant.MARGARETYou think I'm stupid?RICHARDNo, but what's behind door number two...MARGARET(SCREAMS)I forgot!   OK?   I forgot!RICHARDForgot what?MARGARETWhat it was like!RICHARDWhat what was like?MARGARETTo have a family!   I forgot what it was like
          to have a family.   I've been on my own since
          I was thirteen, and I'd forgot what it was
          like to have people that love you, and make
          you breakfast, and give you necklaces...89.Suddenly, Margaret has a hard time speaking and is short of
          breath.   She goes to the side of the speed boat.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          I'm going to take a walk.RICHARDWe need to head back...MARGARETAlone.   I need alone time.RICHARDWhat?
          Margaret looks at Richard with a scared and confused look.MARGARETI'm, uh, about to lose my shit.   Big time.
          I need a second.RICHARDBut...MARGARET(PANICKED)Stop right there!
          Richard puts up his hands in surrender and stays put.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          I'm going to be over there.   Away from you.
          Just sit down, turn around, and act like
          you're not here.
          Richard goes to speak, but Margaret motions for him to sit down
          and turn around.   He does.   Margaret gets off the boat and walks
          away from him on the glacier.ON THE GLACIERMargaret tries diaphragmatic breathing to calm down.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          (manic, to herself)
          You can do this.   Couple more hours, and
          then you'll never see these people again.
          Eventually you'll write a letter.
          Apologize.   Send the necklace back.RICHARD(from the boat)
          Margaret!MARGARETNo talking!90.RICHARD(from the boat)
          Watch your step, OK?   It can be dangerous.MARGARETAgain, you're not supposed to be...
          Margaret doesn't finish her sentence.ON THE BOATRichard sits with his back turned to Margaret, waiting for her
          reply.   He doesn't hear anything.   That's weird.RICHARD(back still turned)
          Margaret?
          Richard turns around and looks for Margaret.   He doesn't see her.
          He gets out of the boat and goes onto the glacier, walking in the
          direction he last saw Margaret.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Margaret?   I know I'm breaking "the rules"
          here, but where are you?
          He takes one more step before he hears...MARGARET (O.S.)(YELLING)Richard!!!!!!!!   Help!!!!!!!!
          Richard still can't see her, but runs in the direction of her
          voice.   He soon rounds a mound of ice and sees that --
          Margaret's been swallowed by the ice.   Her upper torso sticks out
          of the glacier, held up by her arms.   Her eyes are wide, and
          she's almost hyperventilating.     It's a bizarre sight.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Oh, thank God!
          Richard tries to control himself, but BURSTS OUT LAUGHING.
          Margaret is really scared.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Wh-, wh-, why are you laughing?RICHARDI'm sorry.   I'm sorry.   Just relax.   I'll
          get you out of there.   You've broken through
          an ice bridge.   It happens all the time.   No
          biggie.MARGARETDon't do that.91.RICHARDDon't do what?MARGARETThe thing that doctors do in E.R. when they
          tell the gunshot victim who is bleeding to
          death that they're going to be OK.   Don't do
          that!RICHARDIt's not like that.   Really.   We do need to
          be careful here though, I don't want us both
          to fall in.   Stay still, OK?MARGARETUh-huh.
          Richard is ten feet away from Margaret now.   He's checking the
          ice to see if it is stable.   He slowly walks her way.RICHARDSo, I'm going to walk up to you and very
          slowly pull you out.   OK?MARGARETI'm really cold.RICHARDYeah, that's normal when you're surrounded
          by ice.MARGARET(makes sense)OK.Richard stands over a stuck Margaret, whose head just comes up to
          his knee.   He calmly looks down on her.RICHARDSo I'm going to pull you up by your armpits.
          I'm probably going to touch boob.   But don't
          freak out.
          Margaret shakes her head yes.   Richard reaches down and slowly
          lifts her out of the ice.   Margaret doesn't say a word.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          When I get you all the way out, I need you
          to hold onto me.   I'm going to carry you
          over there.
          Margaret nods yes as she puts her arms around Richard.   He's
          strong, so it isn't difficult for him to slowly carry her "over
          the threshold" style, away from the hole in the ice.   He speaks
          once they're safe.92.RICHARD (cont'd)
          I've, uh, never done that before.MARGARETYou said it was "no biggie".RICHARDYeah.   Well.   You OK?MARGARETYeah.   I'm fine.
          Richard smiles.   Margaret smiles back.
          Richard walks very comfortably with her in his arms.   She fits
          just right.   Margaret looks up to Richard gratefully.
          MARGARET (cont'd)(SMILING)You shouldn't of laughed at me.RICHARDYou woulda laughed at me.MARGARETYeah.   While I was getting my camera.
          The two stare at each other for a beat.   There's a real spark.
          They might kiss.RICHARDGertrude wants me back.
          Whoah.   Not what she was expecting.   She looks down.MARGARETAnd?RICHARDWell.   It seemed like you were having...
          second thoughts.MARGARETYeah.   I was.RICHARDMaybe we should do it.   Come clean.MARGARETPut me down.
          Richard puts Margaret down near the boat.   She tries to regain
          her composure.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          You wanna call it off?93.RICHARDIf you do.MARGARETFine.   It's over.   We'll tell them when we
          get back.ON THE BOATMargaret sits hunched over with a blanket wrapped around her.
          Richard drives the boat.   They don't talk.EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAYRichard and Margaret walk towards the house, which looms above
          them as they prepare to deliver the news that they aren't getting
          married.   The front door opens, and Geoffrey comes outside in a
          hurry.   He's clearly been waiting.GEOFFREYCome with me.RICHARDWhere's mom, dad?   We all need to talk.GEOFFREYNot now.   C'mon.
          Richard and Margaret look at each other, not sure what to do.
          Geoffrey storms off and they follow.EXT. PAXTON GUESTHOUSE - DAYRichard, Margaret and Geoffrey arrive at the door to the
          guesthouse.   Geoffrey stops before they go in.GEOFFREY(to Richard)

          this, and I don't plan to.
          (to Margaret)
          I was really beginning to like you.   Sorry
          about this.

          The truth is... I've been working for
          Margaret for three years.   Six months ago we

          Richard stands under a gazebo, and smiles at his mother in the
          front row.   He ignores Geoffrey.
          Gertrude sits nearby, next to Gilbertson.
          From the gazebo, Richard nods at a GROUP OF CELLO PLAYERS, who
          begin playing from downloaded sheet music that reads "Kool and
          the Gang, Cherish".   Heads turn with the start of the music, to
          see Annie walk Margaret down the aisle.
          When Margaret recognizes the song, she smiles.MARGARET(mouthing to Richard)
          Nice song.
          Richard shrugs his shoulders.GRANDMA ANNIEIs that your song, dear?MARGARETI guess so.
          Margaret and Annie stop at the end of the aisle.   Looking up,
          Margaret sees the justice of the peace, Ramone.                      (Yes, the same
          guy from the liquor store and the strip club.)RAMONE97.GRANDMA ANNIEIt's me, Ramone.

          whisper while they walk up to Ramone.RICHARDYou look gorgeous.MARGARET(SMILING)You look disgusting.RICHARDSo, is this what you dreamed of when you
          were a little girl?MARGARETOh, you bet.
          They make it to the Gazebo, where Ramone awaits.

          recognition to the beauty, honesty, and
          unselfish ways...
          Margaret looks at Richard on the word "unselfish," but he's
          looking straight ahead, determined to get through this.
          RAMONE (cont'd)
          ...of Richard and Margaret's true love...
          "True Love" gets Margaret as well, although no one in the
          audience notices.
          RAMONE (cont'd)
          ...before their family and friends.
          "Family and Friends" gets a reaction out of Gertrude and
          Geoffrey.   She purses her lips.   He holds on to his chair in
          order to keep himself seated.
          RAMONE (cont'd)
          For it is family and friends who taught
          Richard and Margaret to love, so it is only
          right that family and friends all celebrate
          that love here today.98.RAMONE (cont'd)
          And if there is anyone who has cause why
          this couple should not be united in marriage
          and love, they must speak now or forever
          hold their peace.
          Gilbertson stays quiet.   Geoffrey takes a tug from a flask.
          Ramone is about to continue, but something gets his attention.
          He's not sure what to do.
          RAMONE (cont'd)
          Mi amo, do you have a question?

          question though.RAMONECan it wait ‘til after?MARGARETUh.   Um.   No.RICHARDWhat are you doing?
          Margaret gathers herself and turns around to the crowd.     They
          stare back, unsure what to make of this foreigner.MARGARETHey there, folks.   Thanks for coming out.
          I've got a little announcement to make about
          the "wedding."RICHARDDon't do this.
          Margaret smiles and squeezes Richard's hand.MARGARETNot sure the best way to tell you all this.
          But, uh... I made Richard marry me.   This is
          all a sham.

          Margaret nods, hands Richard the bouquet, and confidently walks

          where and who he is with, he puts his beer down.   He turns to
          Gertrude again with a determined look, gives her a kiss on the
          lips, then follows it up with an even bigger kiss.
          When they finish, Gertrude is grinning, eyes closed.

          Thing is... when I said goodbye to Margaret?

          Gilbertson smiles as he looks out the window and sees the plane
          leave Sitka.109.EXT. TOWER - DAYRichard and his family stand outside the tower and watch
          Margaret's plane take off.RICHARDWell.   That's it.   Once she gets back to New
          York, it'll be like this never happened.
          Richard looks defeated.   Geoffrey sees how sad his son is, and
          takes a deep breath.GEOFFREYSo, you know I think you shouldn't be with
          Margaret, right?RICHARDYou've made that crystal clear.GEOFFREYGood.
          (looks at Annie)
          Well, consider this me keeping my promise.
          Geoffrey pulls out his cell phone and hits a button.   He waits
          for an answer.
          GEOFFREY (cont'd)
          (to phone)
          Hey!   Maguire!   Yeah, yeah, yeah, her
          running out was something.   But that's what
          I'm calling about.   I've got a favor to ask
          you, ‘bout one of your planes...INT. PLANE - DAYGilbertson continues to talk.   Margaret is in a stupor.MR. GILBERTSON...you know those two hundred pages I took
          out?   I'm going to put them back...
          A flight attendant comes to Margaret and interrupts.FLIGHT ATTENDANTMs. Mills?   Would you come with me?
          Margaret is excited to get away from Gilbertson.MARGARETYes, of course.
          She unbuckles her seat belt, about to get out of her seat.MR. GILBERTSONWhat's this about?110.FLIGHT ATTENDANT(never done this before)
          There's someone on the radio for you.
          The flight attendant points to the Flight Attendant CB located at
          the front of the plane, outside the cockpit.
          FLIGHT ATTENDANT (cont'd)
          Uh, a Richard Paxton?
          Margaret shakes her head and re-buckles her seat belt.MARGARETTell him I'm not here.CUT TO:INT. TOWER - DAYRichard and his family are huddled around the radio in the tower.
          Chuck sits nearby.FLIGHT ATTENDANT (O.S.)(from radio)
          I'm sorry.   She won't come talk to you.RICHARDShit!   She's never going to pick up...CHUCK(to Richard)
          Know what, home slice?   Cut this chica
          loose.   You remember Beth Cable?   She'd
          totally be into you...
          Suddenly, Richard has an idea.   He picks up the hand mic.RICHARDExcuse me Miss Flight Attendant, could you
          ask the captain to do me one more favor...CUT TO:INT. PLANE - DAYDING!   The captain comes on over the loudspeaker.CAPTAIN(over plane loudspeaker)
          Welcome to flight 1601 to Seattle, this is
          your captain.   We've reached our cruising
          altitude of 30,000 feet.   Flight time'll   be
          three hours and thirty minutes.   And
          Margaret?   Richard has something he'd like
          to say to you.111.RICHARD (O.S.)(over loudspeaker)
          Uh, hey Margaret.   And cause I'm on the
          loudspeaker, hey everyone on the plane.
          The other passengers look around to try and figure out who's
          Margaret.   Meanwhile, Margaret looks down and acts like she
          doesn't know either.
          RICHARD (O.S.) (cont'd)
          (over loudspeaker)
          This certainly isn't how I wanted to do
          this.   I mean, I'm not really into the whole
          baring your soul in front of strangers
          thing, but I figure it's now or never.   So
          here goes.CUT TO:INT. TOWER - DAYRichard puts down the hand mic for a second to gain composure.
          His family encourages him on.CHUCKYou're doing great, man.
          Richard pushes the button down on the hand mike.RICHARDI know you're used to being on your own.
          And that you're comfortable with your life
          the way it is.   And that in a million years
          you wouldn't have thought that we should be
          together.   I know, because I felt the exact
          same way.CUT TO:INT. PLANE - DAYEvery passenger is enraptured by the words coming out of the
          loudspeaker.   The flight attendants, the Handsome Man, everyone.RICHARD (O.S.)(over loudspeaker)
          And you know what else I know?   I know that
          I'm tired of being alone.   And I think
          you're tired of being alone too.   So come
          on.   Talk to me.   Please.
          The Handsome Man turns to Margaret.HANDSOME MAN(with genuine concern)
          Do you really feel like you're alone?112.MARGARETOh, good lord.CUT TO:INT. TOWER - DAYRichard and his family stare at the radio, waiting to see if
          there is going to be an answer.   Chuck crosses his fingers.MARGARET (O.S.)(from radio)
          What the hell are you doing?
          Everyone in the tower smiles.   They're making progress.RICHARDWe need to talk.
          (Intercut as necessary.   Margaret stands at the front of the
          plane with the passengers watching.)MARGARETAbout what?RICHARDHave you ever thought there might be a
          reason we've been together for the last
          three years?MARGARETAs boss and assistant.RICHARDThings change, Margaret.MARGARET(INCREDULOUS)Things change?RICHARDYeah, things change.MARGARETIs that the best you got?
          Geoffrey hits Richard, as if to say "see, that's what I said."
          Richard composes himself.RICHARDNow, tell me the truth.   When you left, were
          you relieved or sad that we didn't have an
          excuse to be together anymore?
          Geoffrey gives Richard the thumbs up.   That was a good one.113.MARGARETWhat's your point?RICHARDBecause I am sick that you left.   And if you
          feel sick too, then why shouldn't we just be
          together?
          Margaret goes to answer, but stops.   Richard is right.   She wants
          to go back.   Even the passengers on the plane can see it.
          Gilbertson panics.MR. GILBERTSONAre you thinking about going back to him?
          Margaret doesn't answer.
          MR. GILBERTSON (cont'd)
          We have a deal!   You can't back out now!
          The flight attendant steps in, annoyed that Gilbertson is trying
          to break up Richard and Margaret.FLIGHT ATTENDANTSir, you need to sit down.MR. GILBERTSONI will do no such thing.FLIGHT ATTENDANTSir, I'm ordering you to return to your
          seat.

          (he pokes the flight attendant)
          I'm a federal officer, so why don't you get
          me another cocktail and mind your own...
          BUZZ! ZAP!                                                            400,000 Volts of electricity surge through
          Gilbertson.   He twitches violently and crashes to the floor.
          Behind him, The Handsome Man holds a stun gun and a badge.HANDSOME MANWell, I'm a federal Air Marshall.   And
          you're under arrest for disobeying a crew
          member, assault, and possible intoxication.114.The Handsome Man pulls out flex cuffs, zips them around
          Gilbertson's wrists, and throws him in the bathroom.   He then
          takes the CB from Margaret and speaks to the passengers.
          HANDSOME MAN (cont'd)
          Sorry everybody, but protocol says we need
          to get this unruly passenger off the plane
          ASAP.   Sitka's the closest airport, so if
          it's OK with you, I'm gonna have the captain
          turn this bird around.
          There are wild cheers from the passengers.   Margaret blushes.

          Told you I was a romantic.EXT. SITKA AIRPORT RUNWAY - DAYFlight 1601 glides to a safe landing.   Richard and his family
          wait on the tarmac, and the plane taxis to them.   A truck drives
          stairs to the front door of the plane and the door opens.
          Margaret steps out.   Richard walks up the steps.MARGARETThis wasn't supposed to happen.
          Richard looks Margaret in the eye.RICHARDBut it did.
          Margaret looks down.   A little embarrassed.MARGARETI'm not the kind of girl who gets saved.
          Richard smiles, and without warning, Margaret grabs him, and
          plants a long, deep, and wet kiss on him.
          The long kiss is interrupted by the Handsome Man and Gilbertson.HANDSOME MANUh, sorry, but excuse us.
          The Handsome Man leads a handcuffed and still dazed Gilbertson
          down the steps.MARGARET(to Gilbertson)
          Hey!   Do you think getting arrested might
          affect you at work?
          Gilbertson has no retort.115.MARGARET (cont'd)

          your book after all.MR. GILBERTSONSo you are getting married this weekend?MARGARET(SMILING)Absolutely not.   But who knows?
          (looking at Richard)
          We might by the time you get out of jail.
          Gilbertson makes a "go to hell" face and shuffles off.
          Margaret turns back to Richard.   All smiles.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          I've got some explaining to do.
          Margaret and Richard walk down the steps and stand in front of

          Ramone slides onstage and SINGS with the band.   He has a
          beautiful voice.
          Debbie and Geoffrey cut a rug.   They've done this before.116.Gertrude and Annie chat and laugh at a nearby table.   The
          Handsome Man brings Gertrude a drink.   Grandma Annie winks and
          leaves these two alone.
          Margaret and Richard dance.   All smiles, even though they aren't
          very good.
          And as everyone dances, we track up the tallest tree on the
          island, to an eagle's nest at the very top.   Inside the nest,
          three eaglets chirp along to the music, snuggled up to Margaret's
