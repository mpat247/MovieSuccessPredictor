      opens his dazed eyes, to SEE an axe chopping through the

      go.

     his way down the street. He is punch drunk with mace in his

     boys freeze they are fucked, nowhere to go, but CHECHNYAN 1
     is blinking profusely he can't be sure where they are. He
     lets off a magazine into the manikins next to our boys who
     all hit the deck. The magazine runs dry, CHECHNYAN 1 dips
     into his belt to extract a fresh one. Mumbles see's his
     opportunity, he grabs a golf club that is standing next to
     him, runs at CHECHNYAN 1 and takes a massive swipe at his
     head. CHECHNYAN 1 goes down, but he has already put in a
     new magazine. Mumbles is still carrying the cases, One Two

     pulp, but they have still got a running sprit. The run goes
     on and on. CHECHNYAN 2 has ripped off his jacket, we can
     see his massive scar covered torso dripping in blood and
     sweat, he seems unstoppable. One Two gets confident and
     starts to run backwards egging CHECHNYAN 2 on, CHECHNYAN 2
     is a good runner, but not good enough. Deep hate fills his
     eyes as One Two makes a fool out of him, CHECHNYAN 2 will
     remember this man. One Two is taking complete liberties, he
     almost stops and waits until CHECHNYAN 2 has caught up to
     him and then he tears off, the CHECHNYAN keeps coming.

     One Two see's in the distance a tiny moped approaching from
     a distance, its CHECHNYAN 1 who completely out sizes the
     machine. However, he's moving and it's moving faster than
     One Two. One Two ducks off the tracks and over a wall, the
     moped gets nearer. At least when he gets over the wall, the
     moped won't follow right? One Two's over. He can hear the
     moped on the other side, One Two looks over his shoulder he
     can see the moped being lifted over the wall. "Oh shit."
     This is where One Two's "zone" comes into play. He drifts
     in to a place that he can not be disturbed and he runs and
     runs and runs. Up, down, through and in.98   EXT. STREET                                                        98We see Mumbles has caught up with One Two along side the

                able to wait because you now know
                what's coming, so he's gonna fire.

      Danny, who is now in a state because Johnny has predicted
      everything he's going to do, suddenly turns with his gun.
      Mickey catches it, the force of the stop pulls the trigger,
      and the other MANS head is drilled through. Roman joins the
      wrestling match and gets the gun and wrist to aim at Danny's
      head. The trigger gets squeezed and Danny's head also gets
      a drilling. Silence. Johnny, who is smothered in blood,
      speaks coolly.JOHNNY STORYMickey, pass me the gun.

      Mickey is out to lunch, but Johnny sounds commanding.JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D)MICKEY quickly, pass me that gun in

      He looks on in horror and points the gun at Johnny. Just as
      he's about to fire,..there is a great smash of bone on timber.

      painting, his lucky painting. Uri's expression changes, his
      world has been shattered, he's thinking very ugly thoughts.
