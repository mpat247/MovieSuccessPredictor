    unforgiving, summer-scorched prairie.BEVERLY (OS)..."Life is very long..."2   MILES OF STRAIGHT ROAD                                      2Two lanes, not a car in sight. Cracked asphalt undulates over
    gentle, browned hills, disappears into an infinite horizon.BEVERLY (OS)TS Eliot. Not the first person to say
              it, certainly not the first person to
              think it.3   A LAKE IN THE GATHERING DUSK                                3Flat, still. An empty aluminum rowboat lolls listlessly,
    tied haphazardly to an old wooden dock.BEVERLY (OS)But he's given credit for it because
              he bothered to write it down.4   AN OLD FARM HOUSE SITTING ATOP A LOW HILL                   4At the end of a long gravel road.   Surrounded by towering
    black walnuts and lace-bark elms.   A farm once, no one's put
    a plow to earth here in decades.BEVERLY (OS)So if you say it, you have to say his
              name after it. "Life is very long:" TS
              Eliot. Absolutely goddamn right.

    Wrap around porches, forgotten gardens. Imposing in the
    gathering gloom. A single downstairs window glows.BEVERLY (OS) (CONT'D)Give the devil his due. Very few
              poets could've made it through Eliot's
              trial and come out, brilliantined and
              double-breasted and Anglican.

BEVERLY'S DIMLY LIT STUDY - TWILIGHT                     5BEVERLY WESTON. A craggy, wise and deeply sad Okie.    We take
    a long moment, just to study that face.BEVERLYNot hard to imagine, faced with
                 Eliot's first wife, lovely Viv, how
                 Crane or Berryman might have reacted,
                 just foot-raced to the nearest bridge;
                 Olympian Suicidalists.

    Stares out the window at the darkening, ominous horizon.BEVERLY (CONT'D)Not Eliot: after sufficient years of
                 ecclesiastical guilt, plop her in the
                 nearest asylum and get on with it.

    He sits   at a cluttered desk, his face damp with sweat. Nurses
    a glass   of whiskey, his staggered delivery due more to his
    careful   selection of words than drunkenness. He's talking to
    someone   we do not yet see.BEVERLY (CONT'D)God-a-mighty. You have to admire the
                 purity of the survivor's instinct.

    From somewhere upstairs, a THUD. He looks to the ceiling.BEVERLY (CONT'D)Violet. My wife. She takes pills,
                 sometimes a great many. They affect...
                 among other things, her equilibrium.
                 Fortunately, they eliminate her need
                 for equilibrium...6   INT. VIOLET'S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT                              6Full of shadows. She sits up slowly from rumpled sheets.
    We're on her profile, CLOSE, silhouetted against the faint
    light from the open bathroom door. She hesitates on the edge
    of the bed, getting her bearings. Finds a pack of Winstons,
    lights one. Listens to the voices filtering up from below.

    HER CLOSELY. Her hair unkempt, her steps unsteady, into --BEVERLYThe reasons why we partake are
              anymore inconsequential.

    The hallway, walls lined with photos of long-dead pioneer
    ancestors and faded school photographs of three daughters.BEVERLY (CONT'D)The facts are: my wife takes pills and
              I drink. That's the bargain we've
              struck, just one paragraph of our
              marriage contract... cruel covenant.
              And these facts have over time made
              burdensome the maintenance of
              traditional American routine.

    She makes her way to the stairs starts down.BEVERLY (CONT'D)Rather than once more vow abstinence
              with my fingers crossed in the queasy
              hope of righting our ship, I've chosen
              to turn my life over to a Higher Power
              and join the ranks of the Hiring
              Class.

    The light from the study slices across the living room.BEVERLY (CONT'D)It's not a decision with which I'm
              entirely comfortable. I know how to
              launder my dirty undies. Done it all
              my life, but I'm finding it's getting
              in the way of my drinking.

    She can see a portion of Beverly's desk, a woman's legs.

                 is cold-blooded and not just in the
                 metaphorical sense. She does not

     Barbara is reeling, trying to comprehend.VIOLET (CONT'D)He did this though, not us. Can you
                  imagine anything more cruel, to make

     Barbara feels sick, the floor giving away beneath her.       She
     takes a moment. Then:BARBARAYou're right, Mom.    You're the
                  strong one.

     She goes to her mother, kisses her. Turns, heads into the
     hall, grabs her purse and Bev's keys from the dish.

     Violet only slowly realizes Barbara's gone.VIOLET...Barbara?

     Barbara drives off. The driveway now empty again. Violet
     alone outside on the walkway. She turns back to the house,

     We stay on Barb as she slowly pulls herself back together.
     Brushes tears from her cheeks. Laughs darkly. Notices her
     hands are shaking from the adrenaline.

     Slows, pulls the pick-up to the side of the road at the top
     of a small rise. Climbs out, stares out over the miles of
