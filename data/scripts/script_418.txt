          the stars. We're CLOSE ON her FACE and we hear:HAZEL (V.O.)You have a choice in this world, I
           believe, about how to tell sad
           stories.

          CUT TO a SERIES OF QUICK IMAGES:
          - Hazel and the BOY we will come to know as AUGUSTUS "GUS"
          WATERS (17) at an outdoor restaurant in some magical place.
          [They look very much like the perfect Hollywood couple.]HAZEL (V.O.)On the one hand, you can sugar coat
           - the way they do in movies and
           romance novels.

          - "Perfect" Hazel and "Perfect" Gus sit on a BENCH
          overlooking an incredible seascape in some foreign country.
          She rests her head on his shoulder.HAZEL (V.O.)Where villains are vanquished
           and... heroes are born and...
          - "Perfect" Hazel and "Perfect" Gus kiss in a dark room.HAZEL (V.O.)... beautiful people learn
           beautiful lessons...

          - "Perfect" Hazel and "Perfect" Gus fall onto a bed together.
          They look deep into one another's eyes.HAZEL (V.O.)... and nothing is too messed up
           that can't be fixed with an apology
           and a Peter Gabriel song.

          BACK TO Hazel on the grass, still watching the stars. Were
          those dreams or were they memories? Still unclear.HAZEL (V.O.)I like that way as much as the next
           girl, believe me. It's just not the
           truth.

          Hazel closes her eyes.HAZEL (V.O.)This is the truth.
          And EVERYTHING GOES BLACK. We HEAR:HAZEL (V.O.)Sorry.FADE IN ON:2.INT DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAYThe real Hazel is no less beautiful than the one we just saw.HAZEL (V.O.)Late in the Winter of my 17th
           year...

          There are, however, some key and obvious differences.
          First, you'll notice the OXYGEN TUBE in her nostrils which
          help her to breathe.

          Second, you'll notice her hair - which we couldn't see in the
          grass. It's much shorter than the "Perfect" version, the
          result of someone whose head was completely shaved a few
          years before.HAZEL (V.O.)... my mother decided I was
           depressed.HAZELI'm not depressed.

          Hazel's legs dangle over the side of an exam table. Her
          mother FRANNIE (early 40s, younger than she feels) explains
          to the DOCTOR:FRANNIE... she eats like a bird. She
           barely leaves the house,HAZELI'm not depressed.FRANNIE... she reads the same book over
           and over...DOCTORShe's depressed.HAZELI'm not depressed!

          Off her look, CUT TO:
          QUICK SEQUENCE, which play over:HAZEL (V.O.)The booklets and web sites always
           list depression as a side effect of
           cancer...

          - A SHOPPING MALL. Filled with TEENAGE GIRLS - gossipping,
          laughing - being teenage girls, basically. And here's Hazel.
          With her Mom. And her oxygen tank. Just another day.3.HAZEL (V.O.)Depression's not a side effect of
           cancer...

          - HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM. She sits watching game shows in the
          middle of the afternoon. Her Mom brings her a sandwich. A
          glass of water. And then a whole host of prescription meds.
          Hazel eyes them with indifference.HAZEL (V.O.)... it's a side effect of dying.

          - A STARBUCKS. Hazel sits alone reading a dog-eared, heavily
          underlined copy of a novel ("An Imperial Affliction" by Peter
          Van Houten). She only looks up when distracted by a squeal of
          delight. A YOUNG GUY has lifted a YOUNG GIRL over his
          shoulder playfully. He spins her around. Hazel watches a beat
          - goes back to the book.HAZEL (V.O.)Which is what was happening to me.

          And we CUT BACK TO:INT DOCTOR'S OFFICE - SAMEFrannie continues to talk to the doctor. Hazel continues to
          dangle her feet.FRANNIE... some days she won't even get
           out of bed.
          The Doctor scratches his beard, thinking.DOCTORI may switch you to Zoloft. Or
           Lexapro. And twice a day instead of
           once.HAZELWhy stop there?DOCTORHmm?HAZELKeep `em coming. I can take it. I'm
           like the Keith Richards of cancer
           kids.
          The Doctor looks at Frannie who just shakes her head.DOCTORHave you been going to that Support
           Group I suggested?
          Instead of answering, Hazel looks at her Mom.4.FRANNIEShe's gone a few times.HAZELI'm not sure it's for me.DOCTORIf you're depressed --HAZEL(EXASPERATED)I'm not de--DOCTOR(IGNORING HER)-- support Groups are a great way
           to connect with people who are...HAZELWhat?DOCTOR(BEAT)On the same journey.HAZEL"Journey?" Really?FRANNIEHazel.DOCTORJust give it a chance, ok? For me.
          Hazel rolls her eyes, knows she's lost this battle.DOCTORWho knows? You might even find
           it... enlightening.SMASH CUT TO:INT CHURCH BASEMENT - DAYCLOSE UP on PATRICK (30s, pony-tail). He has a guitar.PATRICK... we are gathered here today -
           literally - in the heart of Jesus.
          ANGLE on Hazel who just shakes her head. This is the lamest
          thing she could be doing right now.PATRICKWho would like to share their story
           with the group?
          The basement is filled with SICK PEOPLE. Hazel among them.
          Most are under the age of 18. QUICK CUTS:5.SPEAKER #1Jillian. 15. Lymphoma.SPEAKER #2Angel. 17. Ewing sarcoma.PATRICKPatrick. 34. Testicular. It started
           a few years ago, when I was...
          As Hazel watches, bored, and Patrick continues, we hear:HAZEL (V.O.)I'll spare you the gory details of
           Patrick's ball cancer. Basically,
           they found it in his nuts, cut most
           of it out, he almost died, but he
           didn't die, and now here he is -
           divorced, friendless, addicted to
           video games, exploiting his
           cancertastic past in the heart of
           Jesus - "literally" - to show us
           that one day - if we're lucky - we
           could be just like him.
          They all say:ALL IN UNISON"We're here for you Patrick."
          Hazel says it the least enthusiastically. She locks eyes with
          her only friend in Support Group, a blonde kid with an eye
          patch, ISAAC. He's also shaking his head.PATRICKWho else would like to share?(NO RESPONSE)Hazel?
          Oh no. Patrick gestures for her to speak. Reluctantly she
          stands, sighs...HAZELI'm, uh, Hazel. 16.(BEAT)Thyroid originally but with quite
           the impressive satellite colony in
           my lungs.
          Not much more to say, Hazel is about to sit down.PATRICKAnd how are you doing Hazel?
          Hazel has no idea how to answer that.HAZEL (V.O.)You mean besides the terminal
           cancer?6.But that's not what she says. She says:HAZELAlright? I guess...?
          Isaac tries not to laugh at this. Hazel sits back down.ALL IN UNISON"We're here for you Hazel."
          Hazel exhales. This is not at all helpful. A few more beats.PATRICKMaybe now I'll play a song...EXT CHURCH - LATERFrannie sits in the car in the parking lot, reading from a
          book, waiting for Group to be over. She sees the church door
          open and puts the book away. Hazel comes out. Frannie looks
          at her like "well, was it great?" Hazel just exhales and gets
          in the car. CUT TO:INT HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY"America's Next Top Model" is on the TV. Hazel sits on one
          side of the L-shaped couch, flipping through her novel.
          Frannie and Hazel's dad MICHAEL (40s, kind, doing his best to
          stay positive) sit on the other side, watching her - but
          trying not to make it seem that way. After a few beats:FRANNIEIt's Friday night.HAZELHmm?FRANNIEI was just thinking... you should
           call your friends, see what they're
           up to.HAZEL(DISINTERESTED)That's ok.
          Frannie and Michael look at one another, don't say anything.MICHAELWanna see a movie?
          Hazel looks up from the book. Sees her parents. Gets an idea.HAZELWhy don't you guys go to a movie?
           (off their look)(MORE)7.HAZEL (CONT'D)You haven't been out in a while.
           Go. Have fun. Take the night off.
          Frannie and Michael look at one another again.MICHAELThis is a really good show.
          Hazel sighs. And just like that, everyone goes back to what
          they were doing. CUT TO:
          QUICK SEQUENCE, which plays over:HAZEL (V.O.)And that was my life.
          - Hazel watching TV, book in hand.
          - Hazel in another doctor's office.
          - Hazel popping pills.HAZEL (V.O.)Reality shows. Doctor's
           appointments. Eight prescription
           drugs, three times a day.INT HAZEL'S KITCHEN - ANOTHER DAYHazel and her parents in the kitchen.HAZEL (V.O.)And worse worse worst of all...
           support group.HAZELUgh. You can't make me.MICHAELOf course we can, we're your
           parents.
          Hazel frowns.MICHAELHazel, you need to get out of the
           house. Make friends. Be a teenager.HAZELIf you want me to be a teenager,
           don't send me to Support Group. Buy
           me a fake ID so I can go to clubs
           and drink gimlets and take pot.MICHAELYou don't take pot.8.HAZELSee, that's the kind of thing I
           would know with a fake ID.FRANNIE(BEAT)Get in the car.
          Hazel mock stabs herself in the stomach with an invisible
          sword. CUT TO:EXT CHURCH - ESTABLISHINGA small Episcopalian sanctuary in suburban Indianapolis.HAZEL (V.O.)And so I went...
          Frannie's car pulls up close to the back entrance.HAZEL (V.O.)Not because I wanted to or because
           I thought it would help. But for
           the same reason I did anything
           these days...
          Hazel, oxygen tank in toe, gets out of the car with Frannie's
          assistance.HAZEL (V.O.)... to make my parents happy.HAZELAre you gonna sit here and wait the
           whole time?FRANNIEOf course not, no. I...
           (she totally is)
           I have errands to run.
          Hazel knows she's not planning to run any errands. She
          doesn't press the issue.HAZELOk.FRANNIELove you.HAZELLove you too Mom.HAZEL (V.O.)The only thing worse than biting it
           from cancer - is having a kid bite
           it from cancer.
          As Frannie gets back in the car, she shouts to her daughter:9.FRANNIEMake some friends!
          Hazel just shakes her head. CUT TO:INT CHURCH - SAMEHazel walks towards the elevator. An EXTREMELY SICK LOOKING
          KID holds it open for her. Hazel thinks better of it.HAZELI'll take the stairs.
          The KID nods. The doors shut. Hazel is reminded - it could
          always be worse. She turns to go, walking right into:GUS HAZELOoph. Sorry!

                         
          A SUPREMELY BEAUTIFUL BOY (we will come to know him as GUS).
          Tall, lean, muscular, straight short mahogany hair, blue
          eyes. Hazel has never seen a better looking kid in her life.GUS HAZELMy bad. No, it's...

                         
          For a brief moment, the Earth stops. They stand looking at
          one another. Hazel is speechless.HAZELExcuse me.
          With the Beautiful Boy watching, a wan smile on his face,
          Hazel shuffles off as fast as she can, ducking into:INT BATHROOM - SAMEHazel catches her breath. Shakes her head. Surprised at
          herself.
          She looks in the mirror. So doesn't like what she sees. The
          Earth starts moving again. CUT TO:INT CHURCH BASEMENT - LATERHazel sits in the Circle of Sick.PATRICKWho would like to begin?
          No volunteers. Hazel catches sight of the Beautiful Boy,
          sitting next to Isaac. He seems to be watching her, that same
          flirty smile on his face. She self-consciously looks away.10.PATRICKIsaac, I know you're facing a
           challenging time. Perhaps you would
           like to say something...
          Isaac nods, rises.ISAACYeah, um... I'm Isaac. 17. Eye
           cancer.(BEAT)It's looking like another surgery
           in a couple weeks. After which,
           well, I'll be blind...
          Hazel tries to focus on what Isaac's saying but it's
          difficult. She still feels the Beautiful Boy's gaze on her.ISAACNot that I'm complaining or
           anything. I know a lot of you have
           it way worse but, still, I mean,
           you know, being blind's gonna
           suck...
          As Isaac shares, the Beautiful Boy doesn't look away from
          Hazel. Hazel finds this intimidating. And intimidation
          irritates her. So she decides to play the game with him,
          meeting his gaze and holding it just as firmly.
          A staring contest.ISAAC...My girlfriend helps. And friends
           like Augustus here...
          Isaac nods towards the Beautiful Boy who now has a name -
          AUGUSTUS. He still doesn't look away from Hazel.ISAACSo... yeah. That's what's up.ALL IN UNISON"We're here for you Isaac."
          The staring contest continues another few beats until:PATRICKAnd does your friend want to speak?
          This causes the Beautiful Boy to momentarily look away. Aha,
          he's lost the contest! Hazel smiles, flicks her eyebrows up
          as if to say "Victory is mine!" He smiles back at her, the
          most radiant smile on the planet. He turns back to the Group.GUSHi. I'm Augustus Waters. 17. Had a
           touch of osteosarcoma bout a year
           and a half ago - lost this baby as
           a result...11.Gus holds up his right leg - a prosthetic.GUSBut really I'm just here at Isaac's
           request.PATRICKAnd how are you feeling Augustus?GUSMe? Oh I'm grand. I'm on a roller
           coaster that only goes up, my
           friend.
          Hazel smiles. Gus catches this. Embarrassed, she stops
          smiling and looks away.PATRICKPerhaps you'd like to share your
           fears with the group, Augustus.GUSMy fears?
          Gus thinks about this.GUSOblivion.PATRICKOblivion?
          ANGLE ON Hazel, intrigued.GUSYeah, see... I intend to live an
           extraordinary life. To be
           remembered. If I'm scared of
           anything it's... not doing that.
          Patrick doesn't quite have the tools to deal with that.PATRICKWould, uh, anyone like to speak to
           that?
          And Hazel's hand goes up. Even Patrick is surprised by that.PATRICKHazel! That's unexpected.
          Hazel stands, takes a second to gather her thoughts. Augustus
          watches her, waits for it.HAZELI just wanna say... there will come
           a time when, you know, all of us
           are dead.
          Gus is now even more fixed on her than before.12.HAZELIt might be tomorrow. Might be a
           million years from now but... it's
           gonna happen. And when it does,
           enough generations will come and
           go, there'll be no one left to
           remember Cleopatra. Or Mozart. Or
           Muhammad Ali, let alone any of us,
           right?
          The look on Gus's face is unreadable.HAZELOblivion's inevitable. And if that
           scares you, well, I suggest you
           ignore it. God knows it's what
           everyone else does.
          A beat. And then an enormous smile spreads across Gus's face,
          not a flirty smile but a surprised one, a real one. CUT TO:EXT OUTSIDE THE CHURCH - LATERHazel waits for her Mom's car to appear.
          Across the parking lot, she sees Isaac going at it with a
          redhead, MONICA (17), sucking face like there's no tomorrow
          against the door of her green Pontiac Firebird. Between
          kisses, we can hear:ISAAC MONICAAlways. Always.

                         
          And Hazel hears:GUSLiterally.
          Hazel turns to find the Beautiful Boy, Augustus, standing
          right next to her.GUSI thought we were in a church
           basement but apparently we were
           literally in the heart of Jesus.
          Hazel smiles.HAZELSomeone should probably tell him,
           don't you think? Jesus? Seems kinda
           dangerous keeping all these kids
           with cancer in your heart.
          Gus laughs.GUSWhat's your name?13.HAZELHazel.GUSNo your full name?HAZEL(CONFUSED)Hazel Grace Lancaster.
          Gus nods to himself, smiles. Still fixated on her.HAZELWhat?GUSI didn't say anything.HAZELWhy are you looking at me like
           that?GUSBecause you're beautiful.
          Hazel is taken aback. No one's ever said that to her before.GUSI enjoy looking at beautiful people
           and I decided a while back not to
           deny myself the simpler pleasures
           of existence. Particularly given
           that, as you so astutely pointed
           out, we're all gonna die pretty
           soon.HAZEL(BEAT)I'm not beaut --
          A CUTE YOUNG GIRL walks past them.YOUNG GIRLHey Gus.GUSHey Alisa.
          Hazel isn't surprised that other girls know Gus. Of course
          they do. She turns back towards Isaac and Monica pawing at
          each other. She hears:ISAAC MONICAAlways. Always.HAZELWhat's with the "always?"14.GUS"Always" is their thing. They'll
           "always" love each other and
           whatnot. Must have texted "always"
           to each other at least four million
           times this year.
          They continue to watch the show. It's pretty gross. Isaac
          squeezes Monica's breast like a clown horn.HAZELHe's gotta be hurting her boob.GUSLet's watch a movie.
          Hazel is again surprised.HAZELOh. Um. Uh...
           (yes!)
           Sure. Yeah. I'm... pretty free thisWEEK--GUSNo I mean now.HAZELWhat?GUSHmm?HAZELWhat do you mean "now?"GUSI've got a car.
          He shrugs. Hazel has never seen someone so confident.HAZELYou could be an axe murderer.GUSThere is that possibility.(BEAT)Come on Hazel Grace... take a risk.
          As Hazel mulls this over, Gus reaches into his pocket and
          pulls out, of all things, a pack of cigarettes! Hazel is in
          disbelief. He flips the box open, puts a cigarette between
          his lips.HAZELOh my god. Oh. My. God. You're
           kidding right?
           (off his look)
           You just ruined the whole thing!15.GUSWhole thing?HAZELWhat, you think that's cool? Oh you
           idiot! There's always a hamartia,
           isn't there? And yours is - even
           though you had FREAKING CANCER you
           give money to a corporation for the
           chance to acquire EVEN MORE
           CANCER!? Ugh. And you were doing so
           well.
          As she rants, Gus continues to look at her with that smile on
          his face. Hazel does not find it so amusing.HAZELLet me tell you... not being able
           to breathe? Sucks. Totally sucks.GUSHamartia?
          Hazel folds her arms and turns away from him.HAZELA fatal flaw.
          Gus takes a beat and then moves to face her, the smile still
          etched on his face.GUSThey don't hurt you unless you
           light them.HAZELSorry?GUSI've never lit one.
          Hazel turns back to him.GUSIt's a metaphor. See? You put the
           thing that kills you between your
           teeth. But you don't give it the
           power to do the killing.
          Hazel is floored. And impressed.HAZELMetaphor.
          Gus holds her gaze. And it's at this point Frannie pulls up.FRANNIEHi sweetheart. Ready for some
           "Model?"16.Hazel looks at Gus, cigarette dangling from his lips. Cool as
          anything. Handsome as hell. She looks back at her mom.HAZELCan't tonight.
           (off her confused look)
           I've made plans with Augustus
           Waters.
          And with that, she walks off. Frannie looks at the boy with
          the cigarette in his mouth. This could be trouble. Or
          awesome. Or both. And we CUT TO:INT GUS'S CAR - LATERHazel is terrified. Turns out, Gus is the world's worst
          driver. When he brakes, her body flies forward against the
          seatbelt. And when he hits the gas, seconds later, her neck
          snaps back in the seat. Gus sees the look on her face.GUSI failed the test a couple times.HAZELYou don't say.GUSMost amputees can drive with no
           problem but... yeah. Not me.HAZELI'm surprised you have a license.GUSTell me about it!
          Another brake forces Hazel against the seat belt.GUSThe fourth time I took the test...
           it was going about how this is
           going... and when it was over, the
           instructor looks at me and goes,
           "your driving, while unpleasant...
           is not technically unsafe."HAZELAha. Cancer perk.GUSTotal cancer perk.
          A few beats of silence.GUSSo what happened to you?
          Hazel takes a deep breath. She's told this story before but
          somehow this seems different.17.HAZELI was 13 when they found it.
          And as she speaks, we see it unfold.

          - With a PICC line in a chemo chair.HAZEL (V.O.)All of which worked for a while.
          - A RADIOLOGIST looks at an X-ray. He's not pleased.HAZEL (V.O.)And then stopped working.
          - 14-Year Old Hazel lies in bed, struggling to breathe.
          Frannie runs her fingers through her hair. Dad calls 9-1-1.HAZEL (V.O.)And then my lungs started filling
           up with water.

           Are you ready, sweetie?
          14-Year Old Hazel nods. Michael can't keep it together any
          longer. He completely breaks down.HAZEL (V.O.)But it wasn't.INT ICU - THE NEXT MORNINGThe sun shines in the room. 14-year old Hazel eats ice chips,
          the color has returned to her cheeks.HAZEL (V.O.)The antibiotics kicked in. They
           drained the fluid from my lungs.
           And in time I got better. Stronger.INT YET ANOTHER HOSPITAL ROOM - DAYSlightly older Hazel is getting more intravenous medication.
          It's never ending.HAZEL (V.O.)I even found myself in an
           experimental trial. You know the
           ones that are famous in the
           Republic of Cancervania for not
           working.
          - A SECOND RADIOLOGIST examines a second X-ray.HAZEL (V.O.)It's called Phalanxifor. Didn't
           work in over 70 percent of patients
           but, for some reason...
          The Radiologist looks surprised.HAZEL (V.O.)...it worked in me. They called it
           "The Miracle."
          And finally, BACK TO:INT GUS'S CAR - SAMEGus has one eye on the road, the other on Hazel. He was
          impressed with her before. He's totally dazzled now.HAZELTumors shrank, my mets have hardly
           grown since...(MORE)19.HAZEL (CONT'D)Of course my lungs still suck but,

           the aura of sophistication...
          He smiles at her. She smiles back. Shoves his upper arm
          playfully. They're easing into each other.
          Eventually Gus's car pulls into his driveway.GUSWe're here.
          He's as good at parking as he is at driving. CUT TO:EXT/INT GUS'S HOUSE - SAMEHazel follows Gus inside. She quickly notices all sorts of
          engraved plaques and framed signs with phrases like "Home is
          Where the Heart Is" and "True Love is Born from Hard Times."
          Hazel looks at Gus quizzically.GUSMy parents call them
           "encouragements."
           (rolling his eyes)
           Don't ask.
          Gus's MOM and DAD (40s) are in the kitchen making dinner.GUSHey guys.GUS'S MOMAugustus, hi. New friend?20.Gus's parents don't seem surprised to see Gus with some
          random girl in their house. Hazel takes note of that.GUSThis is Hazel Grace.HAZELIt's just... Hazel.GUS'S DADHow's it going, Just Hazel?GUS(ABRUPTLY)Downstairs if you need us!
          Gus drags Hazel to the next room. As she's pulled:HAZELNice to meet you!
          They walk down the carpeted stairs - Gus having an easier
          time with his one leg than Hazel is with her oxygen tank and
          weak lungs.
          Eventually they arrive at Gus's basement bedroom. There's a
          TV with a video game console, a few band posters, and a whole
          host of basketball memorabilia (autographed sneakers, school
          trophies, framed images etc.) Gus sees her looking at them.GUSI used to play.HAZELMust have been pretty good.GUSThese are mine. And these. The rest
           of it's just cancer perks.
          Gus grabs a DVD from his stack of DVDs. Hazel sits down on
          the bed, her breathing noticeably heavier.HAZELNeed to sit.
          Gus sits down next to her on the bed.HAZELDon't get any ideas.
           (catching her breath)
           All that standing... and stairs...
           and then more standing... lotta
           standing for me.GUSI understand.21.HAZELI'll be fine in a minute. Unless I
           faint. I'm a bit of a Victorian
           lady, fainting-wise.
          Gus smiles. He waits for her breathing to slow down. In time:GUSYou ok?
          Hazel nods, smiles.GUSSo what's your story?HAZELI already told you my story. I wasDIAGNOSED --GUSNot your cancer story. Your story.
           Interests, hobbies, passions, weird
           fetishes...HAZELUm...GUSDon't tell me you're one of those
           people who becomes their disease.HAZELNo. I'm just... I don't know... un-

           Think of something you love. First
           thing that comes to mind.HAZEL"An Imperial Affliction."GUSOk. What's that?HAZELIt's a novel. My favorite novel.GUSDoes it have zombies?HAZEL(LAUGHING)What?

           (off his look)
           But not in that way, trust me. The

           title that does not contain zombies
           or stormtroopers. And in
           exchange...
          Gus pulls a book from his bookshelf.GUS... all I ask is that you read this
           brilliant and haunting novelization
           of my favorite video game.
          Hazel looks at the slim, ridiculous novella. She laughs.
          She's adorable when she laughs. She takes the book from him
          and as she does, their hands get tangled together for a
          brief, charged moment.GUSYour hands are cold.HAZELNot so much cold as under-
           oxygenated.GUSOoh Hazel Grace...(BEAT)I love it when you talk medical to
           me.
          Hazel blushes. And off her completely smitten smile, CUT TO:23.INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - ANOTHER NIGHTHazel sits in bed reading Gus's novella. Frannie stands in
          the doorway, notices the new book.FRANNIEThat's different.
          Hazel shrugs. Frannie looks intrigued.FRANNIEDid he give it to you?HAZELBy "it" do you mean herpes?
          Frannie rolls her eyes. Hazel's phone buzzes. She excitedly
          checks it - only to be disappointed. Frannie notices.FRANNIEI'm sure he'll call, don't worry.HAZELI'm not worried. Please. It's not
           like I'm waiting for him to call or
           anything. I just... we hung out. No
           big deal.
          Frannie says nothing to that. Her silence says it all. Hazel
          rolls her eyes. CUT TO:QUICK SERIES OF SCENES:Hazel continues "not to wait" for Gus's call. We see her:
          - Brushing her teeth. And checking her phone.
          - Watching TV. And checking her phone.
          - Eating breakfast. And checking her phone.
          - Looking out the window on a rainy day. Trying not to check
          her phone. Willing herself to not check the goddamn phone.
          And checking the phone.
          Where is he?! Did he forget about her?INT HAZEL'S DINING ROOM - NIGHTHazel at the dinner table with her parents. She's a little
          sullen, barely touching her food.
          Hazel's phone buzzes. She tries not to seem too eager to
          check it, what with her parents watching and all. She subtly
          looks down at her lap. And sure enough: a text from Gus! Her
          eyes bug out. We see:24."Tell me my copy is missing the last ten pages or something."
          Hazel smiles. Goes back to eating. Frannie and Michael share
          a quick glance. A second later, there's a follow-up text.
          "Tell me I have NOT reached the end of this book!"
          Hazel smiles again.
          And then a third text:"A BOOK CAN"T END IN THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE?! WHAT IN GOD'SNAME IS THIS MADNESS! AAAAHHHH!"Hazel now laughs out loud. Michael clears his throat. Hazel
          looks up.MICHAELWould you like to be excused?EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATERHazel sits down on a patio chair and dials the phone. Gus
          answers on the first ring.GUS (O.S.)Hazel Grace.HAZELWelcome to the sweet torture of

          At which point she hears a loud WAIL coming from the other

           make this better or worse?
          Hazel genuinely has no idea what the hell is going on.GUSIsaac! Focus. On. Me.
          Hazel waits a few beats for Gus to come back on. Finally:GUS (O.S.)(TO HAZEL)How fast can you get here?
          Hazel thinks about this. And on her face, CUT TO:INT GUS'S BASEMENT - LATERHazel descends the steps. She hears an ungodly moan before
          she sees anyone. What has she gotten herself into? Gus
          appears at the base.GUS(calling to Isaac)
           Isaac, Hazel from Support Group is
           coming downstairs.
          Gus waits for a response. None comes. He gestures for her to
          follow him into the room. Before he does:GUSA gentle reminder: Isaac is in the
           midst of a psychotic episode.(HAZEL NODS)You look nice, by the way.
          Hazel blushes, follows Gus into the room to find Isaac
          sitting upside down in a gaming chair. Tears are flowing down
          his reddened cheeks. Empty soda cans and bags of junk food
          lie around him.HAZELHow ya doing Isaac?
          Again, no response. Hazel looks to Gus for an explanation.GUSSeems Isaac and Monica are no
           longer a going concern.HAZELOh I'm sorry.(BEAT)Do you want to talk about it?
          Isaac starts to sob again.26.GUSHe just wants to cry and play video
           games.HAZELFair enough.GUSIt doesn't hurt to talk to him,
           however. If you have any sage words

           appropriate.GUS"Pain demands to be felt."HAZEL(lights up at that)
           You're quoting my book!
          Gus winks at her. At which point, Isaac lets out another
          howl. Gus gestures for Hazel to sit. The two of them flank
          Isaac. He finally speaks.ISAACShe didn't want to do it after the
           surgery. Said she couldn't handle
           it. I'm about to lose my eyesight
           and she can't handle it.
          Hazel rubs his shoulder in sympathy.ISAACI kept saying "always" to her.
           Always, always, always. And she
           just kept talking over me and not
           saying it back. It was like I was
           already gone, you know? "Always"
           was a promise! You can't break
           promises.HAZELSometimes people don't understand
           the promises they're making when
           they make them.ISAACRight, sure, but you keep the
           promise anyway. That's what love
           is. Love is keeping the promise
           anyway.GUSThat could be an "encouragement."
          It's silent for a beat. And then Isaac stands up, a funny
          look on his face.27.GUSIsaac...?
          Suddenly Isaac starts kicking his chair across the room.GUSHere we go...
          The chair lands against the bed. Gus hands Isaac something
          else to throw, a pillow. Isaac grabs the pillow and slams it
          against the wall. He dives on it and beings pummeling the
          pillow like a maniac.GUSThat's it! Punch that thing.
          And so he does. As he continues to, Gus looks at Hazel,
          cigarette dangling from his mouth.GUSI've been wanting to call you on a
           nearly minutely basis but I have
           been waiting until I could form a
           coherent thought in re: "An
           Imperial Affliction."(SHE SMILES)I can't stop thinking about it.HAZELI know, right?GUSThe only problem is the ending.HAZELIt is rather abrupt.GUSIt's torture! I mean, I totally get
           that she died or whatever - Anna.
           But there is an unwritten contract
           between author and reader and I
           think ending your book in the
           middle of a sentence kind of
           violates that contract.HAZELBut that's part of what I like
           about it. It portrays death
           truthfully. You die in the middle
           of your life, in the middle of a
           sentence. But I do - God, I do want
           to know what happens to everyone
           else.GUSYeah like her Mom.HAZELThe Dutch Tulip Man...28.GUSSysiphus the Hamster...
          Hazel beams. Gus totally gets the book. A bond between them.GUSHave you tried contacting this...
           Peter Van Houten?HAZELI've written letters. He's never
           responded. Apparently he moved to
           Amsterdam, became a recluse. Hasn't
           published anything. Doesn't do
           interviews.GUSSad.(BEAT)Hang on.
           (turns to Isaac)
           Isaac!
          Gus stands and takes the pillow out of Isaac's hand.GUSPillows don't break.
          Gus hands Isaac one of his basketball TROPHIES.GUSYou need to break something.
          Isaac looks at it, then back to Gus as if asking permission.
          Gus nods. Isaac holds it over his head and SMASH! The trophy
          breaks into a million pieces. Isaac almost smiles. Gus hands
          him another.GUSGo to town, my friend.
          And Isaac does. Smashing them one by one. Hazel looks at Gus.GUSI've been looking for a way to tell
           my Dad that I kinda hate
           basketball. Think maybe we've found
           it.
          Isaac grabs more of the TROPHIES, smashing them to pieces.
          Gus and Hazel enjoy the spectacle. When there are none left
          Isaac is panting, standing over the bronze carnage.GUSFeel better?
          Isaac thinks about it. Shakes his head no. Gus puts his arm
          around him but looks at Hazel.29.GUSThat's the thing about pain... it
           demands to be felt.

           is Hazel Grace Lancaster. My friend
           Augustus Waters, who read your book
           - at my recommendation - just
           received an email from you at this
           address. I hope you will not mind
           that he shared that email with me."32.While Hazel reads the letter, we see a SERIES OF SCENES
          showing the next several days. They include:
          - Hazel and Gus drinking coffees at a cafe. He's
          enthusiastically telling a story and she's enjoying every
          moment of it.
          - Hazel helping Gus become a better driver. It's no use.HAZEL (V.O.)"I was wondering if you wouldn't
           mind answering a few questions I
           have about what happens after the
           end of the book. Specifically, theFOLLOWING:"- In his kitchen, laughing, trying to make omelettes.HAZEL (V.O.)"Does Anna's Mom marry the Dutch
           Tulip Man; is the Dutch Tulip Man
           up to something - or is he just
           misunderstood? What happens to
           Anna's friends?
          - Watching TV. Their bodies almost touching. But not quite.HAZEL (V.O.)Lastly, I was hoping you could shed
           some light on Sisyphus the Hamster.
           These questions have haunted me for
           years. And I don't know how long I
           have left to get answers to them."
          And finally, back in Hazel's bedroom. She finishes reading
          this letter into the phone.HAZEL"I know these are not important
           literary questions and that your
           book is full of important literary
           questions, but I would just really
           like to know."
          INTERCUT w/ Gus bouncing a ball against the wall, listening.HAZEL(reading it aloud to him)
           "And of course, if ever you do
           decide to write anything else, even
           if you don't want to publish it,
           I'd love to read it. Frankly, I'd
           read your grocery lists. Yours with
           great admiration, Hazel Grace
           Lancaster. Age 16."GUSNot bad.33.HAZELYou think?GUSBit pretentious. But then again,
           Van Houten uses words like
           "tendentious" and... "bacchanalia"
           so I think he'll like it.
          Hazel smiles, looks at a clock.HAZELIs it really almost 1?GUSGuess so.HAZELI gotta get to sleep.GUSOk...HAZELOk...
          Neither one of them want to hang up the phone.GUSOk...HAZELOk...
          They both laugh at this.GUSPerhaps "ok" will be our "always."
          Hazel smiles.HAZELOk.GUSOk.HAZELOk.
          Gus hangs up. We stay with Hazel. Is it really possible this
          Beautiful Boy likes her? She thinks about it. She's not
          convinced. CUT TO:INT HOSPITAL - RECOVERY ROOM - DAYIsaac lies in bed, bandages covering his eyes, now officially
          blind. A NURSE attends to him while Hazel sits by his side.34.ISAACShe hasn't even visited. Fourteen
           months we were together. What kind
           of person...ISAAC'S NURSEYou'll get over her Isaac. Just
           takes a little time. You'll see.
          The Nurse exits the room.ISAACIs she gone?HAZELYeah.ISAACDid she really just say "you'll
           see?"HAZEL(shakes her head)
           Qualities of a Good Nurse. Go.ISAACDoesn't pun your disability.HAZELGets blood on the first try.ISAACThat is huge. I mean, seriously, is
           this my freakin' arm or a
           dartboard? Three - no condescending
           voice.HAZEL(lays it on thick)
           "I'm gonna stab you with this
           needle now, so there might be a
           little ouchie."
          They laugh and then lapse into silence for a moment.HAZELYou doing alright, Isaac?ISAACI don't know. To be honest, I think
           a hell of a lot more about Monica
           than my eye. Is that crazy? That's
           crazy.HAZELIt's a little crazy.35.ISAACBut I believe in love, you know? I
           don't believe that everybody gets
           to keep their eyes or not get sick
           or whatever, but everybody should
           have true love. Don't you think?
          Hazel thinks about it as Isaac presses the button on his pain
          pump, self-administering morphine.ISAACGus was here earlier.HAZEL(trying to be nonchalant)
           Was he?
          Isaac exhales as the pain pump starts to kick in.ISAACMmm... that's better.HAZELThe pain?
           (off his slow nod)
           Good. Good, Isaac.
           (Isaac closes his eyes)
           What about Gus?
          But Isaac is already asleep. Whatever he was going to say
          about Gus is gone. Hazel nods, pats his hand. CUT TO:INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - MORNINGHazel rolls out of bed, stumbles to her computer. She
          casually checks her in-box and is shocked to discover - he's
          written her back!HAZELHoly shit!(READING ALOUD)"Dear Ms. Lancaster... I cannot
           answer your questions, at least not
           in writing, because to do so would
           constitute a sequel, which you
           might publish or otherwise share on
           the internet. Not that I don't
           trust you, but how could I trust
           you, I barely know you."
          Hazel's jaw hangs open as she reads the next part:HAZEL"Should ever you find yourself in

          Hazel shows Frannie the note. Frannie reads it.HAZELCan we go to Amsterdam? Please?
          Frannie thinks about how to respond for a beat.FRANNIEHazel, I... I love you and... you
           know I'd do anything for you, but

          Clearly Frannie feels awful. Which makes Hazel feel awful.FRANNIEI mean, I could talk to your fatherOR --HAZELMom, no. Please. Don't do anything.
           Forget I mentioned it.
          A beat between them. Frannie walks out, sadly. Hazel sits on
          the bed, totally bummed now for two reasons.HAZEL (V.O.)Guilt is definitely a side effect
           of cancer.EXT SUBURBAN STREET - LATERHazel and Gus walk together on the sidewalk.37.GUSJust use your wish.HAZELI've used it already. Pre-

           with such cliche wishes?HAZELWait, what?
          The word "crush" has taken Hazel totally by surprise.38.GUSWhat?
          She looks at him. A beat. She quickly looks away, blushing.
          Gus continues on about Disney but all Hazel can think about
          is "CRUSH". She tries not to seem too excited. CUT TO:INT PET SCAN ROOM - DAYHazel, in a hospital gown, is slowly fed through the machine.
          A TECH explains that she should hold still, try and relax,
          etc. But Hazel knows. She knows all about these procedures.
          She's a pro. CUT TO:EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - FRONTGus is waiting on the front stoop when Frannie's car pulls
          up. They're home from the hospital.
          He wears an Indiana Pacers JERSEY and carries a bouquet of
          bright orange TULIPS.
          Michael gets out of the passenger's seat to help Hazel out of
          the car. Gus rises to assist them.MICHAELIs that a Rik Smits jersey?GUSIt is indeed.MICHAEL(BEAT)Man, I loved that guy.
          Hazel sees Gus, wasn't expecting him.HAZELGus?GUSHi Hazel.(BEAT)How would you like to go on a
           picnic?INT HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATERGus is with Frannie and Michael downstairs.FRANNIESomething to drink?GUSI'm great Mrs. Lancaster.39.Meanwhile, upstairs, Hazel gets ready for the date. She's put
          the orange flowers in a toothbrush holder and is putting on
          LIP GLOSS. She can faintly hear the conversation downstairs.
          ANGLE ON Gus sitting on the stairs. Michael next to him.MICHAELYou're a survivor yourself?GUS(taps his leg)
           Didn't cut this fella off for the
           hell of it. Though it is an
           excellent weight-loss strategy.
           Legs are heavy!MICHAELHow's your health now?GUSN-E-C for fourteen months.MICHAELThat's fantastic.GUSI'm very lucky.
          ANGLE ON Hazel, checking herself out in the mirror. Seems to
          like what she sees a lot more than before.
          BACK ON Gus and Michael, downstairs:MICHAELSon, you have to understand...
           Hazel's still pretty sick. She will
           be the rest of her life.
          ANGLE on Hazel, who can hear all of this. She stops what
          she's doing and listens.MICHAELShe'll want to keep up with you -
           she's that kind of girl - but the
           truth is, her lungs --HAZELYou ready Gus?
          Hazel appears, silencing her Father mid-sentence. CUT TO:EXT PARK - LATERBehind the Indianapolis Museum of Art is 152 Acres of Gardens
          and Grounds. Hazel and Gus walk together.HAZELIs this where you bring all your
           romantic conquests?40.GUSEvery last one.(BEAT)Probably why I'm still a virgin.
          Hazel laughs, elbows him.HAZELYou're not a virgin.
           (off his look)
           Are you really?
          Gus picks a STICK up from the dirt. Draws a BIG CIRCLE in it.GUSSee this? This circle is virgins...
          Now Gus draws a much smaller circle inside that circle.GUSAnd this... is 17 year old dudes
           with one leg.
          Hazel laughs. Point made. He grabs her hand, helps her walk
          up a tiny hill. Once up there, Gus lays a blanket on the
          ground. They sit, looking out over a rather odd SCULPTURE - a
          set of GIANT WHITE BONES where children can jump and play.GUS(EXPLAINING)"Funky Bones" by Joep Van Lieshout.HAZELHe sounds Dutch.GUSAnd he is. Much like Rik Smits. And
           tulips.
          Hazel raises an eyebrow at Gus. He's sure taking this
          Amsterdam/Dutch thing pretty far. He removes some sandwiches
          and orange juice out of a basket.GUSSandwich?HAZELLet me guess --GUS(NODS)Dutch cheese. And tomato.
           (she takes one)
           The tomatoes are Mexican. Sorry.
          They eat for a second, their eyes watching the children play
          on the bones.41.GUSHow cool is that? A skeleton being
           used as a playground.HAZELYou do love your symbols.GUSSpeaking of which...
          Gus stands up, takes a cigarette, puts it in his mouth. He
          clears his throat.GUSYou're probably wondering why
           you're sitting here eating a bad
           cheese sandwich and drinking orange
           juice with a guy in a Rik Smits
           jersey.HAZELIt has crossed my mind.GUSHazel Grace, like so many before
           you - and I say this with great
           affection - you spent your Wish...
           moronically.HAZELI was thir--GUSHush! I'm in the midst of a grand
           soliloquy here.HAZELSorry. Please, continue...GUSYou were young. Impressionable. The
           Grim Reaper staring you in the
           face. And the fear of dying with
           your one true Wish left ungranted
           led you to rush into making one you
           didn't really want, for how could
           little Hazel Grace, having never
           read "An Imperial Affliction" ever
           know that her one TRUE wish was to
           visit Mr. Peter Van Houten in his
           Amsterdamian exile.
          Hazel nods in agreement.GUSIf you were smart, you would have
           saved your wish til the time in
           your life when you really knew your
           true self.42.Gus stops talking. Hazel is confused.HAZELBut I... didn't save it.
          Gus smiles.GUSGood thing I saved mine.
          Hazel cocks her head to one side. What is he talking about?GUSGot it in exchange for the leg.(BEAT)And I still have it.
          She starts to realize.HAZELAre you saying --GUSI'm not gonna give you my Wish or
           anything. But I too have an
           interest in meeting Peter Van
           Houten and it wouldn't make much
           sense to meet him without the girl
           who introduced me to his book, now
           would it?
           (Hazel's eyes widen)
           I talked to the Genies and they're
           in total agreement.(BEAT)We leave on May third.
          Hazel is so excited that she grabs Gus and pulls him into a
          hug. Their faces close, lips inches apart, and just when it
          looks like something might happen --HAZELWait a minute.(BEAT)Are you only doing this so I'll
           kiss you?
          A beat. Gus blinks a few times.HAZELCause I'd totally kiss you either
           way.
          And kiss him she does. He's surprised. And when it's over,
          they sit back, look at one another. A magic moment.HAZELSeriously... why are you doing
           this?43.GUSBecause Hazel Grace... I found my
           Wish.
          And Hazel is beyond touched. We hear:FRANNIE (OVERLAP)Are you out of your mind?INT HAZEL'S UTILITY ROOM - DAYFrannie folds laundry while Hazel pleads her case.FRANNIEIt's too much, Haze. We can't

           encouraging!DR. MARIAThe PET scan is encouraging. We
           just don't know how long it'll stay

           foreign country?HAZELThey have doctors in Amsterdam. And
           cancer. Someone will know what to

           loaded.FRANNIEI --HAZELYou've never been to Amsterdam,
           have you Mom?
          And judging from her face, seems she'd kinda like to. Dr.
          Maria looks at Frannie, shrugs - kid's got a point.
          Hazel smiles. And on that smile, we SMASH CUT TO:BLACK.Over which, we HEAR:HAZEL (V.O.)And then this happened.INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT[Note: There's no sound in this sequence. Just images.]
          Hazel wakes up screaming in the middle of the night, shaking
          and holding her head.
          Frannie and Michael burst in. Mom grabs her crying daughter,
          frightened beyond belief, waves to Michael to call for help.HAZEL (V.O.)People talk about the courage of
           cancer patients. And I do not deny
           that courage...
          He leaves the room to do so and Fran stays behind, rocking
          with her daughter, promising her it'll all be ok. Whatever
          nightmare this is, it's going to end. CUT TO:INT FRANNIE'S CAR - MOMENTS LATERStill silent. Michael drives, trying to keep it together.
          Frannie's in the back with Hazel's head in her lap.45.Hazel continues to scream in silence, whether from pain or
          terror, we do not know.HAZEL (V.O.)I'd been poked and stabbed and
           poisoned for years and still I trod

          They're practically running. There's still no sound.HAZEL (V.O.)But make no mistake...
          The doctors rally to assist the screaming, crying child.
          She's wheeled away from her family who can only watch. We
          stay with her and WE HEAR:HAZEL (V.O.)In that moment I would have been
           very, very happy to die.END SEQUENCE.INT HOSPITAL ROOM - ICU - MORNINGThe sound returns. And it's the sound of a heart monitor.
          BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. It's also the sound of a working heart.
          Hazel has made it through. Her eyes open. A NURSE is there.HAZEL'S NURSEHello.HAZELHi.HAZEL'S NURSEYou're ok, Hazel.
          Even Hazel seems surprised by that.HAZEL'S NURSEWould you like to see your parents?
          Hazel nods. The Nurse goes to get them. Soon they come
          bounding in, crying and kissing her repeatedly. So much
          relief. CUT TO:
          LATER. Hazel's bed has been raised up so she can talk to her
          parents "comfortably."FRANNIEThey thought it was a brain tumor.MICHAELIt wasn't - thank god --46.HAZELSo what happened?FRANNIEThe usual. Fluid in the lungs,
           preventing oxygenation. They put
           that in...
          There's a TUBE in Hazel's side draining fluid into a plastic
          bladder that hangs off her bed.FRANNIEDrained a liter and a half last
           night.
          (That's a lot of fluid.)MICHAELThe good news is... no tumor
           growth. No new tumors in your body.
          Hazel nods. That is a relief.MICHAELWe're all so relieved.
          Frannie embraces her daughter.FRANNIEThis is just a thing Hazel. It's a
           thing we can live with.
          Hazel nods again. Only in the universe of Hazel Grace
          Lancaster is something like this just a thing. Meanwhile:INT HOSPITAL ICU - WAITING AREA - LATERHere's Gus, his foot tapping nervously on the floor. It's
          unclear how long he's been waiting there. He sees Michael
          walk down the hall. Races after him.GUSMr. Lancaster! How's she doing?MICHAELBetter, thank you. Much better.
          Gus nods, as relieved as the rest of them.GUSThey won't let me in. Family only.MICHAELI'm sorry --GUSNo I get it. Will you just... will
           you tell her I was here?47.MICHAELOf course I will.

          along with Dr. Maria and THREE OTHER ONCOLOGISTS - her whole
          "Cancer Team."ONCOLOGIST #1The great news is... Phalanxifor

           still seeing serious problems with
           fluid accumulation.(BEAT)So how should we proceed?
          Silence. Hazel looks around the room, waits for someone to
          answer. No one does.HAZELUm, I feel like I'm not the most
           qualified person to answer that.ONCOLOGIST #1I was talking to Dr. Simmons.
          DR. SIMMONS (late 60s, white beard, old school) speaks next.DR. SIMMONSIt's a strange case. Normally the
           tumors start resisting the
           treatment. But that hasn't happened
           here - yet.
          Hazel hears the "yet" the loudest.DR. SIMMONSUnfortunately, the drug may be
           worsening the edema.48.DR. MARIABut if we stopped it entirely,
           we're likely to face even graver
           dangers.MICHAELSo we're gonna do nothing?DR. MARIAThat's what we have to decide. The
           truth is... very few people have

           Hazel has. We don't really know the

          That comforts no one.HAZELCan't I just get like a lung
           transplant or something?
          The Doctors look at one another like "who wants to take that
          one?" Eventually:DR. MARIAYou would not be considered a...
           strong candidate for a transplant.
          Hazel takes that in, nods, tries to pretend it didn't bother
          her. Sensitive Michael on the other hand starts to cry a
          little bit. He grabs Frannie's hand.DR. SIMMONSWe're trying to prevent endothelial
           growth while at the same time
           preventing immunosorbent...
          As Dr. Simmons drones on with some cancer gobbledygook,
          Hazel's eyes remain firmly fixed on her parents. She hates
          what she's doing to them. And seeing them holding hands,
          crying but trying not to cry - it jogs a memory. CUT TO:INT HOSPITAL ICU - FLASHBACKWe saw this once before. It looks like the end for 13-year
          old Hazel. Her father is weeping off to the side while her
          mom stands over her, holding her hand, and asking:FRANNIE(through the tears)
           Are you ready, sweetie?
          13-year old Hazel nods. The doctors get to work. The
          anaesthetic takes hold and Hazel goes under. But not enough.
          Cause she totally hears her mother say:FRANNIEI won't be a mom anymore.49.She falls into her husband's chest. And we're BACK TO:INT HOSPITAL - CONFERENCE ROOMHazel comes out of the memory when her parents see her
          staring at them. She tries to shake it off. Dr. Simmons is
          still talking nonsense when:HAZELI have a question.DR. MARIAYes Hazel.HAZELCan I still go to Amsterdam?
          Dr. Simmons can't help himself. He laughs. Everyone looks at

          Everyone feels horrible now. Dr. Maria, Frannie and Michael,
          and even Hazel. This meeting couldn't have gone worse. And weCUT TO:EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAYHazel parent's bring her home from the hospital. She looks
          miserable. It's clear the last few days have been a big
          emotional set back. CUT TO:INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - LATERHer parents tuck her in.FRANNIEWe'll be right outside.
          Hazel nods. Her phone buzzes. She looks at it. A text from
          Gus that reads: "ok?" Hazel looks at it.
          And she doesn't write back. CUT TO:INT HAZEL'S KITCHEN - ANOTHER NIGHTHazel sits staring at nothing. The house phone rings. Michael
          comes in from another room with the phone in hand. Whispers:MICHAELGus again.
          Hazel thinks about it - silently shakes her head, no. Michael
          says into the phone.MICHAELI'm sorry Gus, she's asleep.
          Hazel stands and goes into her bedroom, clearly depressed.51.INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - LATERHazel reads from "An Imperial Affliction." Her phone buzzes
          again. "Augustus." It just says "hello?" Again she ignores
          it.
          And then a second text. She looks at it. "The silence is
          deafening." She puts the phone back down.
          Hazel's heart breaks. She can't take it anymore. She picks
          the phone back up. She texts the following:
          "I don't know if you'll understand this but I can't see you
          anymore. I mean I want to. I just..."
          She thinks about the rest. She writes:
          "I'm a grenade."
          She sends the text. Waits.
          And then there's more to say. She sends a second text.
          "When I look at you, all I can see is what I'm going to put
          you through. I can't have that. I'm sorry."
          She sends that text. Waits.
          He writes back.
          "Ok."
          Hazel reads it. Writes back: "Ok."
          A beat. Gus responds: "oh my god, stop flirting with me!"
          Hazel smiles - she can't help herself! - but she must. She
          gets her emotions in check. Puts the phone away. CUT TO:EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - ESTABLISHINGAn ugly day in Indianapolis.INT HAZEL'S HOUSE - SAMEInside, Hazel is about as miserable as the weather. The sky -
          and the circumstances - have cast a grey pall over the day.EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - BACKYARDHazel walks out back. Looks up at the clouds, threatening
          rain but not yet delivering it. She sits down in the grass,
          on the verge of tears. She looks at the old rusty SWING SET
          that's been in her backyard for years.52.And starts to cry. Just for a few brief moments, she lets
          herself cry.
          Then she wipes the tears. Becomes strong again. And makes a
          decision.
          Hazel dials her phone. We hear:GUS (O.S.)Hazel Grace!HAZELHi Augustus.GUS (O.S.)Are you crying, Hazel Grace?HAZELKind of.GUS (O.S.)What's the matter?HAZELI don't know. I want to go to
           Amsterdam. And I want him to tell
           us what happens after the book and
           I don't want my particular life and
           also the sky is making me sad and
           there's this old swing set that my
           Dad made for me when I was a kid.
           It's just... everything.
          Hazel is on the verge of losing it again. A few beats of
          silence pass by.GUS (O.S.)I demand to see this swing set of
           tears.
          Hazel can't help but smile and we CUT TO:

          makes everything better.
          They both look at the swing set.GUSI see your point.(BEAT)That is one sad swing set.
          Hazel nudges her head onto his shoulder.HAZELThanks for coming over.53.GUSYou do realize... trying to keep
           your distance from me will in no
           way lessen my affection for you.
          Hazel says nothing.GUSAll efforts to save me from you
           will fail.
          Hazel looks at him. He's sure not making this easy.GUSIs this about Amsterdam? Cause weDON'T --HAZELIt's not about Amsterdam. It's
           about me. It's about...GUSGrenades.
          Hazel nods.GUSI get it. One day you're going to
           explode in a huge ball of fire and

          Gus is silent. He can't argue. They stand there quietly a few
          more beats, looking out at the swing set. Until:GUSWe have got to do something about
           this frigging swing set.INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATERHazel sits at the computer screen writing a Craigslist post.

           You're so busy being you that you

          set into the back of his PICK-UP. Gus salutes the swing set
          as the truck drives off.
          Then he sneaks a quick kiss on Hazel's cheek. She shoots him
          a look. Gus throws up his hands.GUSFriendly.

          Michael lets go of her and wipes away his tears. They look at

          another for medicines and back-up medicines just in case etc.

          head to the front door, buzzing with excitement.
          As they get close, they can hear a commotion inside. A
          WOMAN'S VOICE yelling something unclear, followed by:GUS (O.S.)BECAUSE IT'S MY LIFE, MOM. ITBELONGS TO ME!Frannie immediately puts her arm around Hazel and quickly
          spins her back to the car.HAZELMom?FRANNIEWe can't eavesdrop, Hazel.
          Back at the car, far out of earshot, they wait. Hazel unsure
          what that was about. Frannie politely honks the horn.
          A moment later Gus emerges from the house, smiling. A travel
          bag over his shoulder and a cigarette dangling from his lips.GUS(TO FRANNIE)Always a pleasure to see you ma'am.(BEAT)Hello, Hazel Grace.58.HAZELOk...?GUSOk.HAZELOk.
          Frannie doesn't know what to make of any of that. She just

          Hazel's turn she unhooks the plastic nubbins from her nose.
          Gus places the oxygen tank on the conveyer belt.
          Hazel takes slow, careful steps through the metal detector.
          She seems determined to get through this without any help.
          But upon reaching the other side it's clear that even these
          few steps without oxygen were a struggle.
          Hazel holds on to the side of the conveyer belt to steady
          herself. As soon as her tank reappears she puts the cannula
          back in place. Still light-headed, Hazel closes her eyes and
          focuses on her breathing. She catches her mom looking at her,
          nervously.HAZEL(with some difficulty)

          A YOUNG COUPLE gets up so that Hazel and Gus can sit.HAZELOh that's not necessary.
          But they give up their seats anyway. Hazel and Gus take them.

          attention until a LITTLE GIRL (6, cute braids) appears.59.LITTLE GIRLWhat's in your nose?HAZELIt's called a Cannula. These tubes
           give me oxygen and help me breathe.

          The Little Girl nods, hands it back to Hazel, who quickly
          reattaches it.LITTLE GIRLThanks for letting me try it.

           before?
          Gus shakes his head, he has not. And he's nervous. He pulls a
          cigarette out of his pocket and puts it in his mouth. Within
          seconds a FLIGHT ATTENDANT rushes over.FLIGHT ATTENDANTSir, you can't smoke on this plane.
           Or... any plane.GUS(cigarette in his mouth)
           I don't smoke.
          The Flight Attendant shoots him a look.HAZELIt's a metaphor. He puts the
           killing thing in his mouth but
           doesn't give it the power to kill
           him.FLIGHT ATTENDANT(NO NONSENSE)That metaphor is prohibited on

          The engines roar to life and the plane accelerates towards

          Gus doesn't say it back. Hazel laughs.HAZELThis is what it feels like to ride
           in a car with you.
          Gus grabs Hazel's hand as the plane lifts off. He looks out

          and Gus watch the same gory action movie. Actually, he
          watches the movie. She just watches him watch it. He watches
          it with gusto.
          Hazel continues to watch him. Try as she might, she's falling

          Hazel and Gus share a look.HAZELSomething like that.
          Meanwhile, the landscape outside is flat and dusty, with dirt
          tracks and the occasional concrete building. In other words,
          it looks more like Indianapolis than Holland.HAZEL(to the Driver)
           This is Amsterdam?62.CAB DRIVERYes and no. Amsterdam is like the
           rings of a tree. It gets older as
           you get closer to the center.
          Soon enough, the cab takes an off-ramp and turns a corner and
          suddenly, it's as if they're transported - not only to
          another universe but to another time as well.
          We see MULTI-COLORED ROW HOUSES lined on both sides of a
          windy CANAL. HOUSEBOATS float against the edges and everyone
          rides BICYCLES down cobblestone streets. They're astounded.INT HOTEL - LATERGus helps Hazel and Frannie bring their stuff into the room.

          An OLD COUPLE stands to give up their seats - this happens
          all the time. Hazel again tries to protest and again it falls
          on deaf ears. She and Gus sit. They look out the window onto

          Hazel and Gus look at each other. Is this a dream? The
          champagne is poured and Gus raises his glass.GUSOk.
          Hazel raises hers.HAZELOk.
          They clink glasses and sip.HAZELWow that's good.WAITERDo you know what Dom Perignon said
           after he invented champagne?(BEAT)`Come quickly,' he said. `I am
           tasting the stars!'
          Hazel and Gus smile.WAITERWelcome to Oranjee. Would you like
           a menu or will you have the chef's
           choice?
          Gus looks at Hazel. She shrugs.65.GUSThe chef's choice sounds lovely.
           (the Waiter nods)
           And can we get more of this?WAITERWe have bottled all the stars for
           you this evening, my young friends.
          The Waiter leaves. Hazel and Gus look at each other.GUSThank you for coming to Amsterdam.HAZELThank you for letting me hijack
           your wish.GUSThank you for wearing that dress
           which is like whoa.
          Hazel shakes her head, trying not to smile but unable not to.
          The Waiter brings two more glasses of champagne and a plate:WAITERBelgian white asparagus with a
           lavender infusion.
          Hazel takes a bite.HAZELOh my god.GUSYeah?
          Gus takes a bite.HAZELI mean...GUSThat is just...HAZELThere are no words.
          Meanwhile, down on the water a BOAT passes, filled with
          merry, drinking LOCALS. One of them raises a glass to them
          and says something in Dutch.GUS(SHOUTING BACK)We don't speak Dutch!ANOTHER LOCALShe says, "the beautiful couple is
           beautiful!"66.Hazel and Gus smile. This night could not be going any better
          so far. CUT TO:
          LATER. Hazel and Gus enjoying their second courses.GUSI want this dragon carrot risotto
           to become a person so I can take it
           to Vegas and marry it.
          Hazel leans back in her chair, in need of a breather.HAZELI like your suit.GUSThanks. First time wearing it.HAZELThat isn't the suit you wear to
           funerals?GUSOh no. That one's not nearly this
           nice.
           (off her look)
           When I first found out I was sick -
           I mean, they told me I had like an
           85% chance to be cancer-free. Great
           odds, sure. But that meant a year
           of torture, the loss of my leg, and
           still a 15% chance it might fail.(BEAT)So right before the surgery I asked
           my parents if I could buy a suit,
           like a really nice suit, just in
           case I didn't make it.HAZELIt's your death suit.GUSThat's what it is.HAZELI have one of those. Bought it for
           my 15th birthday. Don't think I'd
           wear it on a date, though.GUSAre we on a date?HAZEL(cocks her head)
           Watch it.
          Gus winks. CUT TO:
          LATER. Dessert on the table. As they euphorically eat:67.GUSGod?HAZELMaybe.GUSAngels?HAZELUndecided.GUSAfterlife?HAZELNo. Well...(BEAT)Maybe I wouldn't go so far as to
           say no. I just... I'd like some
           evidence.(GUS NODS)What do you think?GUSAbsolutely.HAZELReally?GUSOh for sure. I mean, not like a
           heaven where you ride unicorns,
           play harps, and live in a mansion
           made of clouds but, yeah, I believe
           in something.
          Hazel is surprised.GUSSomething becomes of us. It has to.
           Otherwise what's the point?HAZELMaybe there is no point.GUSI refuse to accept that.(BEAT)I won't accept it.
          Hazel thinks about it. She appreciates his conviction but is
          still not sure she agrees. The hand they've been dealt too
          unfair. Hazel looks out at the water as she says:HAZELI hope you're right.GUSI'm in love with you.68.That gets her attention.GUSYou heard me.HAZELAUGUSTUS --GUSI'm in love with you. And I know
           that love is just a shout into the
           void, and that oblivion is
           inevitable, and that we're all
           doomed and that there will come a
           day when all our labor has been
           returned to dust, and I know the
           sun will swallow the only earth
           we'll ever have, and I am in love
           with you.
           (shrugs, matter-of-fact)
           Sorry.
          At which point, the Waiter reappears.WAITERMore stars?
          Hazel is still too speechless to respond, her eyes fixed on
          Gus. Eventually Gus answers for them.GUSJust the check, please.WAITERNo, sir.(BEAT)Your meal has been paid for by Mr.
           Van Houten.
          Gus raises his eyebrows at Hazel. This Van Houten guy is
          something else.EXT AMSTERDAM CANALS - LATERHazel and Gus on a park bench, his arm around her, looking
          out over the water. Seeds blow from the elm trees and the
          reflections of the city ripple in the water below them.
          Hazel leans into his body, just a little. They stay like
          that, savoring the best night of both of their lives. CUT TO:EXT AMSTERDAM - HOTEL - ESTABLISHINGA crisp Spring morning in Amsterdam. The buzz in the air
          outside is equalled by the buzz in:69.INT HOTEL ROOM - SAMEWhere Hazel excitedly paces through the room.FRANNIEI really don't get that shirt.
          Hazel wears a screen print t-shirt of Magritte's "Ceci N'est
          Pas Une Pipe." (A painting of a pipe with words below that
          mean "This is not a pipe.")HAZELVan Houten will get it. Trust me.
           There are like fifty Magritte
           references in "Imperial
           Affliction."FRANNIE(READING)"This is not a pipe."HAZELExactly.FRANNIEBut it is a pipe.HAZELNo it's not. It's a drawing of a
           pipe. See?(SHE DOESN'T)All representations of a thing are
           inherently abstract. A drawing of a
           thing is not the thing itself. Nor
           is a t-shirt of a drawing of a
           thing the thing itself.
          Frannie is still at a loss but she's impressed.FRANNIEWhen did you get so grown up? I
           feel like it was yesterday I was
           telling 8-year old Hazel why the
           sky was blue. You thought I was a
           genius back then.HAZELWhy is the sky blue?FRANNIE(BEAT)Because I say so.
          A knock on the door. Gus pokes his head in.GUSWho's ready for some answers!70.EXT. VONDELSTRAAT ROW HOUSES - LATERGus and Hazel stand outside Van Houten's white house.HAZELI'm so excited I can barely
           breathe.GUSAs opposed to other days...?
          She playfully hits him. He takes her arm, picks up the oxygen
          tank, and up they go towards his front door.
          As they approach, there's a noticeable NOISE coming from
          inside the house. It's the deep thump of a BASS BEAT. Loud.
          Like, obnoxiously loud.
          Hazel grabs the brass ornament and knocks. They wait. There's
          no response.GUSMaybe he can't hear over the music?
          Gus tries again, this time with more force. Still nothing. He
          tries a third time. Finally, the music stops. They wait.
          Still excited.
          A moment later the door swings open.
          It's a MAN IN PAJAMAS (60s), with a huge potbelly, thinning
          hair, and a week-old beard. All he says is:MAN IN PAJAMASWhat?!
          Gus and Hazel look to one another. Could it be?GUSMr. Van Houten?
          At which point, the Pajama Man slams the door in their faces.
          Hazel and Gus are too stunned to react. Through the closed
          door, they hear this:MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)(SHOUTING)LEEE-DUH-VIGH!WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)Are they here, Peter?
          So it is PETER VAN HOUTEN. Gus and Hazel can't believe it.MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)There are two --(BEAT)Who the hell's "they?"71.WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)They are Augustus and Hazel, the
           young fans with whom you've been
           corresponding.
          Gus and Hazel smile at hearing their names. Perhaps this will
          help things take a turn for the better.MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)The Americans?WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)You invited them, remember?MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)You know why I left America,
           Lidewij? To never have to encounter
           Americans. Get rid of them.
          Hazel and Gus can't believe it. This is terrible!WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)I will not do this Peter. Be nice.
          At which point, the door opens - opened by the Woman whose
          voice they'd been hearing - Van Houten's assistant LIDEWIJ
          (30s, Dutch, pretty in a bookish way). She virtually shoves
          Van Houten towards a stunned Gus and Hazel.
          And they are again face-to-face with Van Houten. One beat,
          two beats. No one knows what to say. Finally:VAN HOUTENWhich of you is Augustus Waters?
          Gus raises his hand tentatively.
          Van Houten sizes them up. Without another word, he turns and
          walks inside - at least this time, leaving the door ajar.LIDEWIJPlease. I am sorry. Come in.
          Hazel and Gus share one more awkward glance before Gus takes
          a step. Hazel follows. They walk:INT VAN HOUTEN'S HOME - SAMELidewij leads Gus and Hazel into a living room so sterile
          it's creepy. The walls are empty and white, there's a single
          couch, a small ottoman, and a single lounge chair. That's it.
          Van Houten sits in the chair.
          Off to the side are two large black garbage bags, full and
          twist-tied.HAZELTrash?72.LIDEWIJFan mail. 18 years worth. He never
           opens it.
          Van Houten kicks his feet up on the ottoman and crosses his
          slippers. He motions for them to sit on the couch.VAN HOUTENYours are the first missives to
           which I've replied and look where
           that got me.
          Hazel and Gus take their seats.VAN HOUTENScotch?HAZELUm, no thanks.VAN HOUTENAugustus Waters?GUSIt's 11am.VAN HOUTENJust me then, Lidewij. Scotch and
           soda.LIDEWIJPerhaps some breakfast first Peter?VAN HOUTENShe thinks I have a drinking
           problem.LIDEWIJI also think the Earth is round.
          Nevertheless, Lidewij pours Peter half a glass and hands it
          to him. He takes a sip, then sits up straight.VAN HOUTENSo you like my book.HAZELYes. We - well, Augustus, he made
           meeting you his Wish so that we
           could come here and talk to you.
          Van Houten says nothing. Takes a long pull on his drink.VAN HOUTENDid you dress like her on purpose?HAZEL(looks at her shirt)
           Kinda.73.Van Houten says nothing to that.VAN HOUTENI do not have a drinking problem. I
           have a Churchillian relationship
           with alcohol: I can crack jokes and
           govern England and do anything I
           want to do. Except not drink.
          He glances over at Lidewij, who dutifully refills his glass.GUSIncidentally, thank you for dinner
           last night.VAN HOUTEN(TO LIDEWIJ)We bought them dinner last night?LIDEWIJIt was our pleasure.VAN HOUTEN(SIGHS)You've come a long way so... what
           is it I can do for you?HAZELWe have some questions --VAN HOUTENUh-huh...HAZELAbout what happens, you know...
           after... the end of your book.
           Specifically to those who Anna
           leaves behind. Like her Mom, the
           Dutch Tulip Man, Sisy --VAN HOUTEN(INTERRUPTING)How familiar are you with Swedish
           hip-hop?
          Hazel looks at Gus. Is he kidding?HAZELI would say... limited?VAN HOUTENBut presumably you know Afasi Och
           Filthy's seminal album "Flacken."GUSUm...VAN HOUTENLidewij! Play `Bomfalleralla'
           immediately.74.Lidewij sighs but she does as she's told. A few seconds
          later, some loud Swedish rap song blasts from the speakers.
          Hazel and Gus sit through this, totally baffled.HAZEL(yelling over the music)
           I'm sorry, sir. We don't speak
           Swedish.VAN HOUTEN(YELLING)Who the hell speaks Swedish? The
           important thing is not what
           nonsense the voices are saying, but
           what the voices are feeling.
          The song continues another awkward ten seconds or so before
          Gus has enough. He gets up and turns off the music.GUSAre you messing with us?VAN HOUTENPardon?GUSIs this some kind of performance?VAN HOUTENRudolf Otto said that if you had
           not encountered the numinous then
           his work was not for you. And I say
           to you, my friends, if you cannot
           hear Afasi Och Filthy's bravadic
           response to fearfulness, then my
           work is not for you.
          Hazel is really getting worried at this point. They came all
          this way for this?HAZELSo anyway... when the book ends,
           Anna's mom --VAN HOUTEN(raising a hand to silenceHER)Let us imagine that you are racing
           a tortoise.
          Hazel and Gus fidget in their seats. Lidewij frowns, clearly
          feeling bad for them. Van Houten continues.VAN HOUTENThe tortoise has a ten yard head
           start. In the time it takes you to
           run ten yards, the tortoise has
           moved maybe one yard. And so on,
           forever.(MORE)75.VAN HOUTEN (CONT'D)You are faster than the tortoise
           but you can never catch him, you
           see, you can only decrease his
           lead. Now certainly you can run
           past the tortoise as long as you
           don't contemplate the mechanics
           involved but the question of how
           turns out to be so complicated that
           no one really solved it until
           Cantor's proof that some infinities
           are bigger than other infinities.
          Hazel and Gus have no idea how to respond.VAN HOUTENI assume that answers your
           questions.GUS(TO HAZEL)I don't know what's going on.VAN HOUTENAnd yet you seemed so intelligent
           in print, Mr. Waters.

           Must be all that cancer in your
           brain.LIDEWIJPeter!
          Gus could throw a punch right now. Hazel tries to calm the
          situation.HAZELCan we please, maybe, talk about
           Anna for a sec? I mean, I
           understand that the story ends mid-

           becomes too sick to continue --VAN HOUTENI'm not interested in talking about
           that book.HAZEL- but that doesn't mean her family
           and everyone she loves doesn't have
           a future, right?VAN HOUTENI said I'm not interested --HAZEL(GETTING UPSET)But you promised!(CALMS HERSELF)(MORE)76.HAZEL (CONT'D)Mr. Van Houten, you said you would

           me. Surely you've thought about it.
           I mean, as characters --VAN HOUTENNothing happens to them! They're
           fictions. They cease to exist the
           moment the novel is over.
          This is not what Hazel came all this way to hear. She won't
          accept it.HAZELThey can't!
           (again, has to calmHERSELF)I mean, I understand. In a literary
           sense. But it's impossible NOT to
           imagine some future --VAN HOUTENI can't do this. Lidewij, get rid
           of them, please.
           (Lidewij doesn't move, he
           turns back to Hazel)
           I won't indulge your childish
           whims. I refuse to pity you in the
           manner in which you're accustomed.HAZELI don't want your pity --VAN HOUTENOf course you do. Like all sick

          not Hazel. Van Houten's words have not phased her one bit.
          She rises from the couch.HAZELHey listen douchepants. You're not
           gonna tell me anything I don't

          surprising everyone.
          After a beat:VAN HOUTENLidewij. I'll have a martini
           please.LIDEWIJI have resigned.VAN HOUTENOh don't be ridiculous.
          No one moves. Van Houten realizes he's alone in this.VAN HOUTENI'd like you to leave now.HAZELYou're really not gonna tell us?VAN HOUTENI would like you... to leave.78.Hazel is furious. Gus stands next to her, touches her arm is
          if to say "come on, enough of this guy." CUT TO:EXT VAN HOUTEN'S HOUSE - SAMEGus and Hazel come out of the house, practically shaking. As
          they get to the street, Van Houten has one more thing to say.VAN HOUTENHave you ever stopped to ask why
           you care so much about your silly
           questions?
          A beat.HAZELGo fuck yourself.
          Van Houten doesn't have a response to that. He just shuts the
          door. And when he does, that's when Hazel gets emotional.GUSHey. It's ok. It's ok...
           (beat, an idea)
           I'll write you a sequel.
           (she cries harder)
           I will. Better than any shit that
           drunk could write. With blood and
           guts and sacrifice. You'll love it.
          Hazel nods, then wipes away tears. She fakes a smile and Gus
          gives her a hug. Afterwards:HAZELI spent your Wish on that asshole.GUSYou did not spend it on him. You
           spent it on us.
          They embrace once more.HAZELI wanted...GUSI know... I know. Apparently the
           world is not a wish-granting
           factory.
          This gets a real smile from Hazel. That's when Lidewij comes
          outside. Clearly she's been crying too.LIDEWIJI'm so sorry. Circumstance has made
           him cruel. I thought meeting you

          them begin to walk up the first flight of stairs.LIDEWIJShall we?
          Hazel nods. Both Hazel and Gus walk slowly up the stairs. So
          far so good. They find themselves in an office space.LIDEWIJThis is the bookcase that hid the
           Frank family and four others.
          The BOOKCASE is half open. Behind it is an even steeper set
          of stairs, only wide enough for one person at a time.80.Some of the Travelers begin to walk up the stairs. Gus looks
          at Hazel - are you sure we should continue? She begins the
          climb, determined. Lidewij trails behind, carrying her oxygen
          tank.
          Hazel moves very slowly. We are aware of her labored
          breathing the entire time.
          ANGLE ON OTHER TOURISTS, watching and quietly commenting.
          Just like at the airport, except now in foreign languages.
          Hazel arrives on the NEXT FLOOR - an empty room. She's
          definitely starting to struggle. She leans against the wall
          to catch her breath. Gus comes to her side, wipes her brow.GUSYou're a champion.
          Hazel smiles. When she's feeling up to it they walk into the
          next room, also empty. And another staircase, even more
          narrow and steep - practically a ladder. When Gus sees this
          he looks at Hazel:GUSThat's enough --HAZEL(RESOLUTE)I'm ok.
          Hazel very slowly begins the climb. Again we're aware of her
          every breath. It's dark. And it's becoming very difficult.
          Near the top Hazel stumbles but is finally able to pull
          herself through.
          Once there, she falls to the floor, slumping against the
          wall, trying to catch her breath. Gus crouches next to her.GUSWe're at the top. That's it.
          Hazel becomes aware that TOURISTS look at her with concern.
          She smiles, stands up, nothing to see here.
          And now they're in the final room - a long, narrow hallway.
          This is where Anne Frank and 7 other people lived in hiding
          for as long as they could. There's a TIME LINE detailing
          their story.LIDEWIJThe only member of the whole family
           to survive was Otto, Anne's father.
          Gus takes Hazel's hand.LIDEWIJI don't know how you go on, without
           your family.81.Lidewij stays behind to study part of the exhibit. Gus leads
          Hazel into the room at the end of the hallway where a VIDEO
          details the last days of Anne Frank's life. Over it, we hear
          a YOUNG GIRL's VOICE reading from the diary.
          The Travelers stand to watch and listen. Gus and Hazel do the
          same. The room is dark.GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)"At such moment's, I don't think
           about the misery..."
          Gus and Hazel stand very closely together. The video is the
          cherry on top of a very emotional day. Hazel watches it.GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)"...but about the beauty that still
           remains."
          Gus, meanwhile, is just watching Hazel, the same way she
          watched him on the airplane. After a beat, she catches him.
          Their eyes meet. The emotions build...GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)"Try to recapture the happiness
           within yourself. Think of all the
           beauty in everything around you...
           and be happy."
          And Hazel KISSES Gus. A most passionate, intense, you-and-me-
          against-the-world kind of kiss, better than any they've
          experienced or could even imagine. It seems to last for a
          small eternity.
          Eventually, they break away and open their eyes. They quickly
          notice all the Travelers staring at them. For a brief second,
          they wonder if that was a very inappropriate thing to do...
          When suddenly everyone starts clapping for them, moved by the
          whole thing. One EUROPEAN even shouts "bravo!" Hazel blushes,
          Gus smiles, bows, he grabs her hand. CUT TO:INT GUS'S HOTEL ROOM - LATERThey fall onto Gus's bed, kissing. Hazel is very in the
          moment and now it's Gus who seems nervous. As they kiss:GUSIt's above my knee.
          She ignores him, more kissing. She takes off his shirt.GUSIt tapers a little and then it's
           just skin --HAZELWhat?82.Hazel pulls away from him.GUSMy leg.(BEAT)Just so you're prepared --HAZELOh get over yourself.
          Hazel kisses him again. Now he tries to pull her shirt off
          but it gets tangled in with her oxygen tube. He can't figure
          it out. Eventually the whole thing is hilarious to them. They
          shake their heads - laughing - certainly not your typical
          Hollywood movie moment. And yet, for them:HAZELI love you, Augustus Waters.GUSI love you too, Hazel Grace.
          They resume kissing. And we CUT TO:INT HOTEL ROOM - MORNINGGus wakes up in the bed. He looks around for Hazel but she
          isn't there. On the bed is a piece of paper. A note.
          It reads: "Dearest Augustus..."
          Beneath that is a BIG CIRCLE, labeled "Virgins." And in that
          circle is a SMALLER SECOND CIRCLE labeled "17 year old dudes
          with one leg." We'll notice part of that circle is now
          outside the bigger circle. Gus flashes that signature smile.EXT CAFE - DAYHazel and Gus sit with Frannie drinking coffee in the sun at
          an outdoor cafe. They're re-enacting yesterday's events.HAZEL"Get up you fat bastard."GUS"I can't stand up, I'm too drunk."HAZELI said "get up."GUS"Standing is for fools!"HAZELGod, what an asshole.
          They both giggle at the whole thing.83.HAZELIt was awful, Mom. You can't
           imagine.FRANNIEAnd then what happened?HAZELThen we went to the Anne Frank
           museum.FRANNIEAnd after that?
          A quick glance between Hazel and Gus.HAZELWe just... walked around.
          Hazel and Gus smile, thoroughly in love but trying to keep it
          in check in front of her Mother.FRANNIESounds lovely.
          A few beats later.FRANNIEListen... I'm gonna stretch my legs
           a little. Give the two of you some
           time to talk.HAZEL(THAT'S WEIRD)Um... ok...
          As she stands up to leave, Hazel thinks she catches Gus and
          Frannie making eye contact for a brief second. Once Frannie
          has left them:HAZELThat was weird.
          Gus doesn't respond except to say:GUSShall we?EXT AMSTERDAM STREET - LATERThey start to walk. Gus takes a cigarette out of his pack,
          sticks it between his lips. Hazel notices he's struggling
          with something.HAZELAugustus?84.GUSThere's something I have to tell
           you...
          They walk in silence a few beats.GUSJust before you went into the
           hospital... There was this... I
           felt this... ache in my hip.
          Hazel grabs onto his arm, a lump already forming.HAZELOh no...
          Gus takes the cigarette out of his mouth, clenches his teeth
          tightly, trying not to cry.GUSI had a PET scan.
          Gus sits down on a BENCH. Looks up at her. Tries to smile.
          Before he even says it, she knows.GUSIt lit up like a Christmas tree,
           Hazel...HAZELOh god.GUSThe lining of my chest, my liver...
           everywhere.HAZELOh my god no!
          Hazel loses it in that moment, falling on top of him, hugging
          him for dear life, her head in his lap.HAZELI'm so sorry, Augustus. I'm so soSORRY --GUSI'm sorry too --HAZELIt's so unfair --GUSI should have told you --HAZELIt's so fucking unfair!
          A beat. Gus still trying not to cry.85.GUSApparently the world is... not a
           wish-granting factory.
          And at that point, Gus lets it go, lets himself cry and be
          sad and feel awful.
          But just for a second. Then he shakes it off, pulls Hazel's
          face up to his, tries again to smile through the tears.GUSDon't you worry about me, Hazel
           Grace. I'll find a way to hang
           around and annoy you for a long
           time.
          She hugs him, perhaps a little too tightly. He winces.HAZELDoes it hurt?GUSIt's ok.(BEAT)I'm ok.HAZELOk.GUSOk.
          But of course it's not ok. Not by a mile.
          Hazel takes a moment to look at him, touches his cheek.GUSWhat?HAZELI'm just... I'm very fond of you.
          He grabs her hand and holds it.GUSI don't suppose you can forget
           about it, treat me like I'm not
           dying.HAZELI don't think you're dying,
           Augustus. You've just got a touch
           of cancer.
          Gus nods. Squeezes her hand.GUSWould it be absolutely ludicrous to
           make out right now?86.Hazel doesn't answer. She just kisses him, hard. And on the
          two of them, so in love, we CUT TO:INT AIRPLANE - LATERHazel lays on Gus's shoulder as he stares out the window,
          leaving Amsterdam behind.INT INDIANAPOLIS AIRPORT - BAGGAGE CLAIM - DAYAs they ride down the escalator, Hazel sees Michael standing
          amongst the livery drivers. He holds a sign that says -
          instead of someone's last name - "My Beautiful Family (and
          Gus)."
          Upon seeing them, he immediately starts to cry of course. He
          kisses his wife, gives Hazel a big hug. Gus goes to shake his
          hand but Michael hugs him as well. CUT TO:INT HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM - THAT NIGHTHazel sits with her father on the couch.HAZELGus had a recurrence.MICHAEL(NODS)Mrs. Waters told us the night

           a reason..."
          Michael shakes his head.MICHAELI don't know, Haze.(BEAT)I always thought being an adult
           meant knowing what you believe...(BEAT)... that has not been my
           experience.
          Hazel understands exactly. CUT TO:87.INT GUS'S BASEMENT BEDROOM - DAYGus lays in bed, eyes open, a PICC line now being fed through
          a port in his chest. Chemotherapy at work.
          Hazel and Isaac are keeping him company.HAZELHow are your eyes?ISAACGreat. Wonderful. I mean, they're
           not in my head is the only problem.GUSI hate to one-up you but... seems
           my entire body is made out of
           cancer now, so...
          Isaac nods. Tries not to get emotional but it's happening. He
          goes to touch Gus's arm and accidentally touches his thigh.GUSWhoa, I'm taken.
          Isaac laughs.ISAAC(to Hazel, re: Gus)

           Monica?ISAACNot a word.HAZELShe hasn't even like, texted to ask
           how you're doing?
          He shakes his head. Gus gets an angry look on his face.HAZELThat is so messed up!ISAACI've stopped thinking about it.
           Moving on. There's a new girl in
           Support Group with these humongous -
          Isaac gestures to his chest. Hazel is confused.HAZELHow do you even know that?ISAACI'm blind but I'm not that blind.GUSHazel Grace!
          They turn to him.GUSDo you happen to have four dollars?89.No one knows what that means. CUT TO:INT HAZEL'S CAR - LATERGus is in the passenger's seat. Isaac sits in the back. Hazel
          returns to the car. With a CARTON OF EGGS.HAZELOk now what?
          Gus smiles. CUT TO:EXT SUBURBAN STREET - MOMENTS LATERHazel, Gus, and Isaac lean against Hazel's car staring
          something down.ISAACIs it there?GUSOh it's there.

           Hazel...
          Hazel nods, opens the egg carton, hands Gus an egg. Gus puts
          it in Isaac's hands. Positions Isaac - who, of course, can't
          see a thing - towards the Firebird.
          Isaac winds up and tosses the EGG.
          It misses the car by a mile. After a beat:ISAACI didn't hear anything.GUSA little to the left.ISAACMy throw was to the left or I
           should aim to the left?GUSAim left.
          Isaac turns his shoulders.90.GUSLefter.
          Isaac turns some more.GUSYes! Excellent! And throw hard.
          Gus hands him a SECOND EGG. Isaac winds up and hurls it -
          missing the car again but hitting the HOUSE.GUSBullseye!ISAACReally?GUSNo you missed it by like 20 feet.
           (hands him a THIRD)

          Isaac hurls it, this time smashing the car's taillight.
          Isaac's face lights up.HAZELWoo hoo!
          Isaac grabs for ANOTHER EGG. Throws it. Then ANOTHER. He's a
          throwing machine. Most of them miss but at least he's
          enjoying himself. Finally there's a DIRECT HIT on the car
          door, triggering the alarm. Isaac pauses.GUSKeep throwing, keep throwing!
          Isaac does. Gus smiles, putting an unlit cigarette in his
          mouth. Hazel watches him, enjoying this moment.
          Eventually, MONICA'S MOM opens the front door and comes out.MONICA'S MOMWhat in God's name --

          she turns and goes back inside. The three of them celebrate.
          As Isaac picks up where he left off, Hazel gently kisses Gus
          on the cheek. And over we hear:HAZEL (V.O.)A few days later, Gus landed in the

           for a while.
          Mrs. Waters nods, hugs her again, walks out through the heavy

          on the hill overlooking "Funky Bones." A second picnic, this
          time with champagne. Hazel pours some for them both into
          little Winnie the Pooh cups. She's trying to be upbeat - but
          it's difficult. Gus watches the kids play on the bones.HAZELWhat are you thinking about?GUSOblivion.HAZELAugustus...GUSI know it's kid's stuff but... I

          to it. She gets out of her car, opens his driver's side door,
          and finds him sitting there, his shirt stained with vomit and
          blood. She gags from the smell.GUS(MUMBLING)Hi.
          Hazel looks down at his hands which are pressed tightly to
          his belly. She sees something is leaking from the TUBE
          sticking out of it.HAZEL(PANICKED)Oh, God, Augustus, I'm calling 911.GUSNo! Please! Hazel, listen to me. Do
           not call 911 or my parents -- I'll

          That is it. But there's another ten minutes of driving to do.
          Hazel thinks fast.HAZELNo of course not. Um... what
           else...(THINKS)so much depends/ upon a blue sky/

          in her arms. And continues...HAZELSo much depends upon this observer/
           of the universe...
          As Gus is drifting off to sleep, WE HEAR:HAZEL (V.O.)One of the less bull-shitty
           conventions of the cancer genre is
           the convention known as the "Last
           Good Day..."EXT GUS'S HOUSE - ANOTHER DAYGus comes home from the hospital. He does not look good - but
          he lives. Hazel is there to help get him inside.INT GUS'S HOUSE - ANOTHER DAYGus no longer sleeps in his basement. Nor does he sleep in
          his own bed. He sleeps in a HOSPITAL BED set up in a guest
          room. Hazel is with him. They're watching sports on TV.HAZEL (V.O.)This is where the victim of cancer
           finds himself unexpectedly with
           some hours...EXT GUS'S BACKYARD PORCH - ANOTHER DAYHazel and Gus getting some fresh air. She sits there reading
          a book. Gus just sits there. His eyes staring off into
          nothing. Hazel waves to him. Gus looks over, as if waking
          from a dream. She manages a smile. He manages one back.97.HAZEL (V.O.)... when it seems like the
           inexorable decline has suddenly
           plateaued, when the pain is for a
           minute bearable.INT HAZEL'S DINING ROOM - ANOTHER DAYHazel sits at dinner with her parents. She is barely touching
          her food.HAZEL (V.O.)The problem, of course, is that
           there's no way of knowing that your
           last good day is your "Last Good
           Day." At the time, it's just
           another decent day.
          The phone buzzes and Hazel answers it.HAZELHi, Augustus.GUS (O.S.)Good evening, Hazel Grace.
          His voice is strong today, and Hazel is happy to hear it.GUS (O.S.)Quick question for you. Did you
           ever write that eulogy I asked you
           to prepare?HAZELI may have...GUSExcellent. Do you think you could
           find yourself at the Literal Heart
           of Jesus in 20 minutes.HAZELUm... sure. Is everything --GUS (O.S.)I love you Hazel.
          The call ends. Hazel, confused, stands to go.HAZELI gotta go.FRANNIEFinish eating first.HAZELI can't, I have to meet Gus.98.FRANNIEYou haven't eaten a thing.HAZELI'm not hungry.FRANNIEYou can't not eat, Hazel.HAZELI am aggressively unhungry, ok?MICHAELHAZEL --HAZELI have to go.FRANNIESit down.HAZELNo!MICHAELHazel, listen to your mother.
          Hazel tries to push past her but Frannie grabs her shoulders.FRANNIEYou have to eat, Hazel. You're not
           gonna starve yourself to death just
           because Gus is sick. You have to
           stay healthy --HAZELI can't! I can't stay healthy
           because I'm not healthy, Mom. I am
           dying. I am going to die and leave
           you here alone and you won't have
           me to hover around and you won't be
           a mother anymore, and I'm sorry,
           but I can't do anything about it,
           ok?! Just leave me alone!
          Upon seeing her mother's face change, Hazel immediately
          regrets this.FRANNIEYou heard me?
          Frannie has tears in her eyes. Hazel looks away, feeling
          terrible.FRANNIEYou heard me say that to your
           father?
          Frannie sits down on the couch with her daughter.99.FRANNIEOh god, sweetie. I'm sorry. I was
           wrong, ok? It wasn't true. It's not
           something I believe.
          Michael sits across from them.FRANNIEAs long as either of us is alive, I
           will be your mother. Even if you
           die, I --HAZELWhen.FRANNIEEven when you die, I will still be
           your mother. I will always be your
           Mother.
          By now Michael is crying too. They all are.HAZELI worry that you won't have a life.
           That you'll sit around all day with
           no me to look after and stare at
           the walls and be miserable or off
           yourselves or something.FRANNIEWe're not gonna off ourselves. It's
           gonna hurt like hell to lose youBUT --MICHAELHazel. You of all people know it's
           possible to live with pain.
          She takes that in. It rings true to her. Hazel nods.FRANNIEI don't just sit around, you know.
          Hazel is confused. Frannie looks at Michael like, "should I
          say something?" She goes for it.FRANNIEI'm taking some classes. Online. To
           get my master's in social work.HAZELYou are?
          Hazel is stunned.HAZELSo when you're waiting for me
           outside Support Group or whatever,
           you're always --100.FRANNIEWorking or reading. If I get my
           MSW, I can council families in
           crisis or lead groups dealing withILLNESS --HAZELWhy didn't you tell me?
          Frannie and Michael don't quite know what to say.MICHAELWe didn't want you to feelABANDONED --HAZELAre you kidding? Mom, this is
           awesome! This is fantastic! Oh my
           god!
          Hazel grabs her Mom for a hug.HAZELI'm so excited! You're gonna be so
           great, Mom!FRANNIEThank you. That means everything to
           me.
          Mom and Daughter hug. And when it's over:FRANNIEI'd still really like you to eat.HAZELI know Mom. And I will. I promise.
           But right now... I really gotta go.INT CHURCH - LATERHazel enters the Literal Heart of Jesus room which is now
          empty except for Isaac, up on a dais, and Gus, in his
          wheelchair. Gus is thinner than we've ever seen him, thinner
          than any young man should be. But for now, he's happy.GUSHazel Grace, you look ravishing.HAZELI know, right?(BEAT)So, um, what's going on guys?ISAACYou're late.HAZELLate for what exactly?101.Gus gestures for her to sit next to him and she does.GUSI wanted to attend my funeral. By
           the way, will you speak at my
           funeral?
          Hazel looks at him like "of course, silly" and then kisses
          him on the mouth.GUSSweet. I'm hopeful I'll get to
           attend as a ghost, but just to make
           sure, I thought I'd - well, not to
           put you on the spot, but I thought
           I'd arrange a pre-funeral.HAZELWhy now?GUSNo time like the present.HAZEL(looks around the room)
           How did you even get in here?GUSWould you believe they leave the
           door open at night?HAZELUm, no.GUSAs well you shouldn't.
          He smiles and for a brief moment it's old Gus. Hazel laughs.
          Isaac clears his throat.ISAAC"Augustus Waters was a self-
           aggrandizing bastard. But we
           forgive him. We forgive him... not
           because he had a heart as
           figuratively good as his actual one
           sucked, or because he got 18 years
           when he should have gotten more."GUS17.ISAACI'm assuming you've got some time,
           you interrupting bastard! I mean
           seriously...
           (back to the speech)
           "Augustus Waters talked so much
           that he'd interrupt you at his own
           funeral. And he was pretentious.(MORE)102.ISAAC (CONT'D)Sweet Jesus that kid never took a
           piss without pondering the
           resonances of human waste
           production. And he was vain. But
           that comes with superhuman
           handsomeness."
          Gus nods - that part is true.ISAAC"But I will say this: when the
           scientists of the future show up at
           my house with robot eyes and they
           tell me to try them on, I will tell
           the scientists to piss off, because
           I don't even want to see a world
           without Augustus Waters."
          Hazel smiles - but it's one that triggers an immediate
          emotional waterfall.ISAAC"And then, of course, having made
           my rhetorical point, I will put my
           robot eyes on because, I mean...
           robot eyes!"
          Gus has a big smile on his face.ISAAC"So anyway, Augustus, my friend...
           Godspeed."
          Gus nods a couple times.GUSThank you Isaac.
          This causes Isaac to lose it. He clings to the lectern.ISAACGoddamn it, Gus.GUSHey don't swear in the Literal
           Heart of Jesus.ISAACShit! Ass! Balls!
          Isaac sighs. Wipes away the tears. And another beat passes.ISAACCan I get a hand here, Hazel?
          Hazel remembers Isaac can't see. She rises, goes up to get
          him, walks him back to her seat.GUSHazel Grace, it's down to you.103.Hazel takes out a piece of paper, walks up to the dais. Takes
          a beat to ready herself.HAZEL"Augustus Waters was the great star-
           crossed love of my life. Ours was
           an epic love story, and I won't be
           able to get more than a sentence
           into it without disappearing into a
           puddle of tears.(BEAT)Like all real love stories - ours
           will die with us, as it should. I'd
           hoped that he'd be eulogizing me,
           because there's no one I'd rather
           have..."
          And that's all she can get out before falling apart. She lets
          it out for a couple beats and then pulls herself together.HAZEL(beat, composing herself)
           "I can't talk about our love story
           so instead I will talk about math.
           I am not a mathematician, but I
           know this: there are infinite
           numbers between 0 and 1. There's .1
           And .12 And .112 And an infinite
           collection of others. Of course,
           there is a bigger infinite set of
           numbers between 0 and 2, or between
           0 and a million. Some infinities
           are bigger than other infinities. A
           writer we used to like taught us
           that. I want more numbers than I'm
           likely to get, and God, I want more
           numbers for Augustus Waters than he
           got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot
           tell you how thankful I am for our
           little infinity. You gave me a
           forever within the numbered days,
           and for that I am eternally
           grateful. I love you."
          Gus smiles, nods, and closes his eyes. CUT TO:BLACK.Over which we hear a RINGING TELEPHONE.INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHTHazel turns on the LIGHT by her bed. Her HOUSE PHONE is
          ringing and it's 4am.
          She knows instantly.104.HAZEL (V.O.)Augustus Waters died eight days
           later in the ICU...
          Hazel's head falls into her chest.HAZEL (V.O.)... when the cancer, which was made
           of him, stopped his heart, which
           was also made of him.
          Her bedroom door opens. It's Frannie and Michael. This only
          confirms her worst fears. She starts to cry. Her parents
          embrace her in the bed.HAZEL (V.O.)It was unbearable. The whole thing.
           Every second worse than the last.EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - SAMEHazel sits in the car in the dark. She's blaring the loudest
          music she can possibly blare - a means of drowning out the
          horrors of the world. Over which we hear this:HAZEL (V.O.)One of the first things they ask
           you in the ER is to rate your pain
           on a scale from 1 to 10. I'd been
           asked this question hundreds of
           times and I remember once, early
           on, when I couldn't catch my breath
           and it felt like my chest was on
           fire, and the nurse asked me to
           rate the pain and though I couldn't
           speak, I held up 9 fingers.
          The loud music isn't protecting Hazel as well as she hoped.
          She falls apart nonetheless.HAZEL (V.O.)Later on, when I'd been feeling
           better, the nurse came in and she
           called me a fighter. "You know how
           I know," she said. "Because you
           called a ten a nine."INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - ANOTHER MORNINGHazel puts on her funeral dress. She looks in the mirror.HAZEL (V.O.)But that wasn't the truth. The
           reason I called it a nine was... I
           was saving my ten.105.INT CHURCH - DAYThe place is filled today with mourners for Augustus Waters.
          Hazel comes in with her parents and stands in the back,
          watching people she's never seen before approach the Waters
          family and extend their deepest condolences.HAZEL (V.O.)And this was it. The great and
           terrible ten.
          When Mr. and Mrs. Waters see Hazel, they open their arms.MRS. WATERSHe loved you so much.
          Hazel nods. Hugs them back.HAZELHe loved you so much too.
          More MOURNERS approach the family, leaving Hazel stranded in
          the receiving line. Her eyes turn towards the COFFIN. She's
          not entirely sure she wants to go there but she takes a deep
          breath, wills herself to walk towards it.
          Gus is there in the same suit he wore to Oranjee.
          Immediately, Hazel breaks down. And immediately, she catches
          herself.HAZELIt's ok, you hear me? It's ok.
          She leans forward and kisses his cheek. She looks around.
          Once in the clear, she pulls out a hard pack of Camel Lights
          and sticks them in the space between Gus and the lining of
          the coffin. A MINISTER approaches at that moment.MINISTERI think we're ready to begin.
          Hazel nods and walks back to her parents, taking her seat in
          the middle of the room.MINISTERAugustus Waters fought hard for
           many years. His battle was a
           courageous one and his strength was
           a source of inspiration for each
           and every one of us...
          Hazel frowns. This is all such bullshit. And she hears:MALE VOICEWhat a load of shit, eh kid?
          Hazel recognizes that voice. But it doesn't make sense. She
          turns around and, sure enough, it's Peter Van Houten.106.MINISTERLet us pray.
          Everyone clasps their hands, closes their eyes. Hazel keeps
          staring at Van Houten, too shocked to do a thing.VAN HOUTENWe need to fake pray now.
          Van Houten bows his head. Hazel, still stunned, slowly turns
          back to the Minister, trying to make sense of this unexpected
          appearance.MINISTERNow I call on Augustus's close
           friend Isaac to say a few words.
          Isaac stands, walks up to the podium with someone's help.
          Hazel sneaks one more look at Van Houten. Yup, it's really
          him. That makes no sense to her. Isaac starts to speak.ISAACOf all the things I've lost in my
           life, this hurts the most.
          And Isaac stops talking. It's unclear if that was the end or
          if he just can't go on. He returns to his seat. The Minister
          walks back up.MINISTERAnd now we'll hear from Gus's...
           special friend Hazel Lancaster.
          Hazel stands, walks up to the podium. A few titters in the
          room at the words "special friend."HAZELI was his girlfriend.
          Some laughter from the crowd. She takes out her notes.HAZELThere's a beautiful quote in Gus's
           home that reads "if you want the
           rainbow, you gotta deal with the
           rain."
          Hazel continues to speak but we over it, WE HEAR instead:HAZEL (V.O.)I didn't believe a word, of course.
           But that was ok. Funerals, I'd
           decided, aren't for the dead.

          Everyone but Hazel. She looks off into the distance.

           a while.
          Hazel hugs Mom and Dad, walks alone towards the parking lot.
          As she gets to the car, Van Houten approaches.VAN HOUTENCould I hitch a ride?
          Hazel doesn't want to help this man.VAN HOUTENJust to the bottom of the hill.
          Hazel exhales. Fine. Once they're both in the car:HAZELHow did you even --VAN HOUTENThe internet.HAZELAnd you just... bought a ticket?VAN HOUTENThe drinks are free drinks in First
           Class.
          Van Houten removes a FLASK from his coat pocket. Takes a

           for everything, for being so rude

           asked me to tell you what happens

           can. No one knows, Hazel. They
           don't talk to us. Unless...
          Van Houten takes out a typed piece of paper. He hands it to
          Hazel who grabs it - and immediately crumples it into a ball.HAZELYou think I care about that? I
           don't give a shit, Van Houten.
          Hazel throws the piece of paper at Van Houten.HAZELYou're a drunk and a jerk and a

          Van Houten knows he's too late. He does as he's told,
          stepping out of the car onto the side of the road. He stands
          there as Hazel peels out.
          In the rearview mirror, she sees him raise the FLASK, as if
          toasting her. She blinks away some tears and drives. CUT TO:INT HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM - DAYHazel lies in front of the TV. "Top Model" is playing but

          can't do anything to stop it. Hazel gets up.INT BATHROOM - CONTINUOUSHazel sits against the tub on the floor and weeps. Soon
          there's a knock.110.HAZEL(THROUGH TEARS)Occupada.MICHAEL (O.S.)Can I come in?
          Hazel leans over and unlocks the door. Michael kneels down
          next to her, putting her head on his shoulder.
          Hazel presses her face into his shirt and cries some more.
          Michael squeezes her tightly. And this time, he doesn't cry.MICHAELI'm so so sorry.(BEAT)It was a privilege to love him,
           though, wasn't it?
          Hazel nods into his shirt. Then looks up at her Dad.MICHAELGives you an idea how we feel about
           you.
          Michael smiles at Hazel. And he doesn't cry. Hazel draws
          strength from him.EXT ISAAC'S HOUSE - NIGHTHazel and Isaac have climbed through his open bedroom window.
          They sit on the roof.ISAACDo you know if it hurt or whatever?HAZELHe was really fighting for breath,
           I guess. He eventually went
           unconscious, but it seems like,
           yeah, it wasn't great or anything.
           Dying sucks.ISAAC(LONG BEAT)It just seems so impossible.HAZELHappens all the time.ISAACAre you angry?HAZELVery.111.ISAACMe too.
           (a few beats)
           Gus really loved you, you know.HAZELI know.ISAACHe wouldn't shut up about it.HAZELI know.ISAACIt was annoying.HAZELI didn't find it that annoying.
          They sit there in silence a few beats.ISAACDid you read the note or whatever
           from your author friend?HAZELHe is not my friend and -- how do
           you know about that?ISAACWe talked at the cemetery. Said he
           came all this way to give you that.HAZELYeah well I'm over it. I never want
           to read another word of that
           asshole's again.ISAACYeah but he didn't write it - Gus
           did.HAZEL(STUNNED)What?ISAACThat's what he said. Gus had
           written something, sent it to VanHOUTEN --Hazel sits up. Her heart is racing.ISAACWhat?HAZELI... I have to go. I... Are you...?112.ISAACI do it all the time. Go.
          As quickly as possible Hazel leaves. Isaac stays behind,
          enjoying the cool night. A new day is coming.INT/ EXT HAZEL'S CAR - DAYHazel is inside the car, rummaging crazily through the trash
          in an effort to find what Van Houten gave her. She's about to
          give up when she sees it - crumpled up into a ball beneath
          the passenger's seat. She reaches under, pulls it up, and
          unwraps it. As she reads, WE HEAR:GUS'S VOICEMr. Van Houten, I'm a good person
           but a shitty writer. You're a
           shitty person but a good writer.
           We'd make a good team. I don't want
           to ask you any favors but if you
           have the time, and from what I saw
           you have plenty, please fix this
           for me. It's a eulogy for Hazel.
          Hazel is overcome with emotion.GUS'S VOICEShe asked me to write one and I'm
           trying, I just, I could use a
           little flair. See the thing is...
           we all want to be remembered.
          She smiles to herself, remembering:
          - That first time Gus and Hazel ran into each other.
          - The staring contest in Support Group.GUS'S VOICEWe all want to leave a mark.
          - Driving (badly) in Gus's car.
          - Their first kiss at the picnic by "Funky Bones."GUS'S VOICEBut not Hazel. Hazel is different.
           Hazel knows the truth. She didn't
           want a million admirers, she just
           wanted one. And she got it. Maybe
           she wasn't loved widely but she was
           loved deeply. And isn't that more
           than most of us get?
          - And BACK TO HAZEL reading the letter, tears in her eyes.GUS'S VOICEWhen Hazel was sick, I knew I was
           dying. But I didn't want to say so.113.INT ICU - FLASHBACKGus stealthily sneaks into Hazel's single room in the ICU.
          She sleeps. He kneels by her side.GUS'S VOICEShe was in ICU and I snuck in for
           ten minutes and sat with her before
           I got caught. Her eyes were closed,
           her lungs were intubated...

          Gus takes her hand and holds it.GUS'S VOICE... but her hands were still her
           hands, still warm, and the nails
           painted this dark blue back color
           and I just held her hands and I
           willed myself to imagine a world
           without us and what a worthless
           world that would be.
          - AND BACK TO HAZEL reading the letter. She never knew that
          story, never knew he was there. CUT TO:EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - LATERHazel walks out to the grass behind her house, the oxygen
          tank dragging behind her. She lays down on the grass and
          looks up at the stars - the same IMAGE that opened the movie.GUS'S VOICEShe's so beautiful. You don't get
           tired of looking at her. You never
           worry if she's smarter than you
           cause you know she is. She's funny
           without ever being mean.SHE REMEMBERS:- The magical dinner at Oranjee.
          - The bench in which they sat overlooking the water.
          - The passionate kiss in Anne Frank's house.
          - Falling onto the bed together.

          [All of these are images we saw at the beginning of the
          movie, only now, we SEE the oxygen tank, we SEE Gus's leg, we
          SEE the fumbling and the difficulties etc. They don't make
          these images less beautiful. They make them twice as
          beautiful - because they're real.]GUS'S VOICEI love her, god I love her. I'm so
           lucky to love her, Van Houten.(MORE)114.GUS'S VOICE (CONT'D)You don't get to choose if you get
           hurt in this world but you do have
           a say in who hurts you.

          - AND BACK ON Hazel in the grass. She holds the letter to her
          chest. A single tear falls onto her cheeks.GUS'S VOICEI like my choices. I hope she likes
           hers.

          Hazel CLOSES HER EYES.GUS'S VOICEOk, Hazel Grace?

          A beat. Another.
          Hazel OPENS HER EYES. And she says to the universe:HAZELOk.BLACK.
