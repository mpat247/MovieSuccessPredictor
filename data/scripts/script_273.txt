                               Brian HelgelandFADE IN:CLOSE ON a spectacular example of PEUCETIA VIRIDANS.
          Descending through mid-air on a silken thread. Neon green
          with black leopard spots on its legs. A Green Lynx Spider.
          As we follow it down, the threaded opening of a GLASS JAR
          appears from the bottom of frame.
          Just before the spider continues inside the jar, it stops,
          suspended. Something's not right. It waves a leg
          tentatively through the air...DARREN'S VOICECome on... Just a little lower...
          WIDEN TO REVEAL a Middle School TOILET STALL. Standing on
          the lid of the closed toilet, holding the glass jar up over
          his head, is DARREN SHAN.
          Darren is 14 and a well-liked kid. Tenacious. Diligent.
           The spider just hangs there.DARRENCome on... I'll take good care of
          you. All the bugs you can eat.MIDDLE SCHOOL BOYS ROOMThe door bangs open and STEVE LEONARD enters. Unlike Darren,
          Steve's not so well-liked. In fact, he can be trouble.
          Maybe that's why they're friends.STEVEHey, Darren!
          No answer. Steve walks along the stall, scoots low so he can
          see any feet in front of the bowls.STEVEDid you fall in? Darren!DARREN'S VOICEShhh...
          Steve looks to the last stall, sees the jar being held up.
          INTERCUT from in and outside of the stall.DARRENYou're gonna scare him away.2.STEVEMan, we're getting killed out
          there. It's three to nothing.
          Darren is all concentration as the spider drops a little.DARRENYour problem, Steve, not mine...
          Steve gets a waggish idea. Stepping to the sink, pressing
          his forefinger over the spigot, he turns the faucet.
          WATER SHOOTS out in a stream, which Steve directs into and
          then over the stall door. Reacting, the spider zips up its
          thread, is lost in the darkened ceiling.
          The stall door opens. Dripping water, Darren stares at Steve
          who flashes a wicked grin...CUT TO:EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAYKids eat lunch, off in their groups. On the field: Darren
          has a SOCCER BALL practically glued to his foot. He dribbles
          through defenders, shoots, SCORES! Steve pumps a fist:STEVEGOAL! Three to one!
          The other team regroups, starts back upfield with the ball.
          Darren steals it. A few strides and WHUMP!
          Darren catches the goalie too far out. The ball lofts just
          over the backpedaling goalie's head, bounces into the goal.STEVE(EXULTANT)Three to two!
          Angry at himself, the goalie KICKS the ball away. It veers
          off toward the street. Steve takes it as a personal insult.STEVEWhat does that prove? Huh?
          The goalie blanches as Steve moves at him. Kids are nervous
          about Steve. He likes to fight. Darren gets between them.DARRENGo get the ball. It's 3 to 2.
          Lunch's almost over.3.STEVEThat's why he kicked it. To kill
          time. Well, I still got time to
          kick your face.DARREN(BLOCKING HIM)Forget it. The ball.
          Steve decides, heads after it. The goalie gulps in relief.GOALIEThanks, Darren. He's crazy.
          Darren watches after Steve. He does have a vicious streak.THE STREETSteve tracks down the ball which has rolled into the street.
          From seemingly out of nowhere...
          A gleaming black 1966 LINCOLN Continental. Its tires sucking
          at the asphalt as it rolls. The windows blacked out.
          It speeds up reaching the ball. Ba-Dump! The ball BURSTS.STEVEYou idiot!
          The car SCREECHES to a stop, idles ominously. Suddenly Steve
          doesn't seem so tough. He looks nervously back to Darren.
          But as a WIND picks up, the Lincoln suddenly tears off.
          A sheet of PAPER is kicked up by one of the car tires. The
          wind sends it sailing. It drifts down, until... Steve
          notices, snatches it out of the air.
          Darren steps up beside him, watches the Lincoln disappear
          down the street. Creepy...STEVELook at this.
          The paper is a FLYER. A startling, violent layout. Beneath
          a snarling WOLF'S HEAD: CIROUE DU FREAK - Human oddities and
          other living curiosities. Midnight. Zeiterion Theater. $20
          - Admission is at the discretion of the proprietor.STEVE.Human oddities and other living
          curiosities...(TO DARREN)Other. Does that mean not human?4.Darren shrugs, takes the flyer.DARRENA freak show. Ever been to one?STEVE(GRINS)Just this school.
          Darren turns the flyer over. There are tire tracks on the
          back. They hear the sound of distant tire squeals, but the
          Lincoln is long out of view. Just an empty street now...CUT TO:A BOA OCCIDENTALISProbing the confines of its glass prison. A BOA CONSTRICTOR
          by any other name. It's a prison within a prison because
          we're inside...THE SCHOOL SCIENCE LAB - DAYThe teacher, MR. DALTON, moves ponderously around the room.
          His voice like a metronome.MR. DALTONAs you can see reptiles and
          amphibians are not one in the same.
          As Mr. Dalton continues, we see various PAIRS OF STUDENTS,
          their computer screens showing text or pictures of various
          FROGS, ALLIGATORS and LIZARDS...
          DARREN and STEVE sit together staring at a Komodo Dragon.
          After Mr. Dalton passes by, Steve switches screen views.
          He's done a WebSearch of Cirque du Freak. There are a dozen
          or so entries. He picks one: History of the Side Show.
          Under 1920's there's an older, much more 'Victorian' pamphlet
          for the Cirque du Freak. A more ornate version of the same
          Wolf Head. The same notice from the proprietor.
          Steve spreads the flyer out to compare. They whisper:STEVE1923...DARRENMust be a different one.
          Steve scrolls down through pictures:5.Sword swallower and glass eater: OHIO GRAY.
          Frog boy: AVERY CHILDS.
          Human skeleton: J.D. COMBS. .and then...
          Egyptian Soothsayer: LARTEN CREPSLEY. Crepsley's gaze is
          startling. Like he can see through the screen, even from
          1923. Steve looks like he's just seen a ghost.
          Suddenly, he hits print. As a PRINTER against the wall
          clicks to life, Steve looks back at Darren.STEVEI gotta show you something...CUT TO:EXT. THE SHAN HOUSE - DAYPicture perfect: two stories, dormers, trellises. 9-year-old
          ANNIE rides up on her bike, bookbag over her shoulder.
          Without stopping, she hops off, dumps it on the lawn by two
          other bikes. A few steps and she's through the door.CUT TO:INT. DARREN'S ROOM - DAYMoody for the daytime. Only the light from the half-closed
          blinds streaking the floor where:
          Darren and Steve are huddled over several clippings and
          pictures that Steve has spread out. They all deal with
          VAMPIRES in some form or another. Steve pulls another stack
          from his backpack, spreads them out as well.DARRENI don't get it.STEVEVampires. I've been studying them.
          Vampires? Darren looks at him a beat.DARRENRight. You're failing half your
          classes at school, but you're
          studying vampires.STEVEThey been around 1000's of years.
          Two tribes. They even fight wars.6.DARRENWhat? When?STEVEOkay, sometimes, when humans fight?
          They fight at the same time. And
          no one knows it. Like at the
          Battle of Stalingrad they fought at
          the same time the Russians and
          Germans were fighting.
          Darren just looks at him, wonders if he's serious.STEVESome people know about it. There
          have even been books written.
          He pulls a frayed old yellow hardcover from his bag.DARRENThat's your proof? It smells.
          Steve's really trying to convince him now.STEVEIt's everywhere if you look. On
          the internet, in blogs, newspapers,
          weird places. But you can find it.
          The room starts to tighten a notch around them.STEVEI chatted online with one of them.DARRENCome on.STEVESerious.
          We become aware of...A SINISTER POVSomeone watching Darren and Steve through the half open
          doorway. It moves in, starts coming up from behind.DARRENWhat was his name? Mr. Dracula?
          Mad now, Steve opens the book, flips pages, finds an old 19th
          Century painting. He slaps down the science lab internet
          print-out of Larten Crepsley. It's the same guy! Maybe...7.STEVEHere he is in 1923. And here 1855.
          Huh? Maybe he'll be there tonight.
          Would that make you believe?
          As Darren looks them over, the POV looms up behind them.
          Suddenly Darren spins...
          And ROARS at what's behind them: his sister Annie. She
          SCREAMS in response. Steve jumps a mile. Darren LAUGHS.ANNIEHow'd you know?DARRENSaw your shadow on the floor.
          Gotta try harder, knucklehead.
          Steve snaps his book shut, shoves it in his backpack.STEVEI'm gonna get a soda.DARRENGet me one, too.
          Steve gets up, stomps out of the room.CUT TO:INT. KITCHEN - SHAN HOUSE - DAYSteve opens the refrigerator, looks to see what's in there.
          At the same time Darren's MOTHER arrives home. Coming in
          through the kitchen door, she sees the refrigerator door
          open, two sneakered feet behind it.MOMI know you want to fight global
          warming, Darren, but that's not the
          way to do it.
          Steve leans back to show his face.STEVESorry, Mrs. Shan.MOMOh hi, Steve. I thought you were,
          Darren.8.STEVEI wish I was.(RE: FRIDGE)You guys got everything in here.MOMHelp yourself.
          She sets her PURSE down on the counter.MOMHow's your mother?STEVEShe's okay... She's been working a
          lot lately.
          A little frown of concern crosses Darren's mom. Something
          about Steve... His mom... He brings out a bottle of soda.MOM(POINTS)Glasses are up there.STEVEI know.
          Darren's mom exits as Steve pulls down two glasses, starts to
          pour soda. As he waits for the foam to settle, he sees...
          The purse. Just there. A quick look around, it doesn't take
          him long to decide. Steve steps over, opens the purse.
          A quick rifling finds a wallet: $200 in $20's. He peels off
          three bills, shoves them in his pocket. BLLEEEP!
          A cell phone starts going off in the purse. Fumbling,
          frantic, Steve stuffs the rest of the money back in the
          wallet, the wallet back in the purse, closes the purse --
          Darren's Mom is back in. She's hurrying to get to her
          celiphone, so...MOM(INTO PHONE)Hello?
          .it takes her a second to realize something's up. Not
          listening to her call, she watches Steve grab the two glasses
          and hurry out, leaving the soda bottle on the counter and
          guilt in the air. As she looks over at her purse...CUT TO:9.INT. HALLWAY - SHAN HOUSE - DAYSteve comes up off the stairs. He sets the glasses on a hall
          table, continues into...DARREN'S ROOMDarren's looking through Steve's vampire memorabilia. Steve
          reaches past, starts packing it up.STEVEI gotta go. See ya tonight.DARRENHuh? Tonight where?
          He zips the bag, slings it over his shoulder.STEVECirque du Freak.DARRENI got no money right now.STEVEDon't sweat it. I got money. Meet
          me ten to Midnight. The Zeiterion
          Theater.DARRENThat place is supposed to be
          haunted.
          Steve rolls his eyes, starts out...DARRENWhat am I going to tell my parents?STEVETell them you're sleeping over. We
          can meet early, walk over together.DARRENI don't know, man...STEVED, it's Cirque du Freak. You wanna
          hear about it Monday? Or see it
          tonight?
          Steve lets his point sink in, then goes.CUT TO:10.INT. KITCHEN - SHAN HOUSE - NIGHTDarren and Annie and his mom and DAD eat dinner. Annie
          chatters away.ANNIEAnd that's why we need a dog.
          She waits for an answer. Mom and Dad exchange a look.DADWe'll have to think about it.ANNIEHow do you guys decide who's going
          to say no when you look at each
          other.DADWhoever's eyes are the widest. And
          I didn't say no. Yet.
          As she tries to think through a new approach...DARRENMom? I'm gonna sleep over Steve's
          tonight? Okay?MOM(emphatic; no hesitation)
          No.DARRENWhat? Why not?MOMBecause I said so, Darren.DARRENI'm fourteen. I shouldn't even
          have to ask stuff like this.MOMThe answer is no. And I'm not sure
          I want you hanging around with
          Steve anymore.DARRENI've known him since I was five
          years old!11.MOMPeople change and I don't like the
          way Steve's changing.DARRENBut -- That's not fair!DADStop arguing with her, Darren.
          Furious at his treatment, Darren gets up, stomps out. As
          Annie wonders if she should ask what's up...CUT TO:EXT. DARREN'S ROOM - NIGHTThe moonlight glinting off Darren's spider terrarium.
          Darren, under the covers, gets out of bed. Fully dressed.
          Going to his door, he listens. Then he crosses to the
          window. Pulling out the screen, he starts to climb out.CUT TO:EXT. TRELLIS - SHAN HOUSE - NIGHTDarren out his second floor bedroom window, starts to climb
          down via the trellis. CRACK! A section of the trellis
          BREAKS under his feet. Darren almost falls, catches hold.
          He pulls himself over, starts down again.CUT TO:EXT. UNION STREET - NIGHTPart of a dilapidated, mostly abandoned downtown. Noirish.
          Darren and Steve hurry around a corner.STEVEI came here after your house.
          There was a van there, guy selling
          tickets.
          (holds up tickets)
          Rest is history.
          They cross toward the ornate, albeit crumbling facade of the
          ZEITERION THEATER. Deserted, except for a few CANDLES
          burning on the sidewalk by a door. The wind moans.DARRENYou know why they closed it, right?
          Years ago a kid fell out of the
          balcony and died. It's haunted.12.Steve catches himself getting spooked. He shoves Darren.STEVEGet inside.CUT TO:INT. ZEITERION LOBBY - NIGHTPaint peeling. The walls scribbled on. Most of all - it's
          dark. Darren and Steve head toward a glow coming from...A HALLWAYThey move toward a light at the end. Darren pauses at a
          darkened staircase. Headed up. He points it out to Steve...DARRENThe balcony. Where he fell...VOICEMay I help you?
          They wheel around, react to the sight behind them. MR. TALL.
          Gaunt, but oozing an elegant toughness.STEVEWe're here to see the show.
          He takes an ominous step forward, then holds out a hand.MR. TALLTicket.
          Steve hands it over. Mr. Tall pockets it, looks to Darren.MR. TALLDo you have your ticket? Darren.
          Darren starts to hand it over, hesitates. The guy knew his
          name. Mr. Tall reaches, takes it.MR. TALLThis way. We're about to begin.
          Mr. Tall turns on his heel and strides off. As they follow:DARREN(LOW)He knew my name.STEVEMaybe he heard me say it.13.Mr. Tall turns a corner, only steps ahead of them. But...AROUND CORNERWhen they turn it, Mr. Tall is gone. Vanished. Ahead, a
          threadbare velvet CURTAIN. A low murmur on the other side.
          The boys exchange a last look, then push through into...THE ZEITERION THEATERMouldings removed, cherubs gouged from the walls of a once
          proud theater. Rows of seats are missing as well. Those
          that remain are filled. The crowd seems nervous, watching
          the empty stage expectantly. Yearning for something special.
          No sign of Mr. Tall. Darren and Steve stand at the top of
          the aisle. The only kids here. Somewhere off stage a
          TRUMPET sounds and with it a stage light goes out.
          Steve nudges Darren, points out two empty seats halfway down.
          As they move for them, a second trumpet sounds and a second
          stage light goes out.
          And so on. By the time Darren and Steve take their seats,
          the theater has gone black. A final flourish from the
          trumpets and all is silent.
          Then, a dull green light glows across the stage. Before it
          was empty; now there is a CAGE, set on wheels, in the center.
          There's the scraping of chain. A low guttural sound.
          A white spot shines down, leaves the front half of the cage
          in light, the back half in shadow. A FIGURE moves in there..
          The AUDIENCE lean forward, hoping to see when there's a ROAR!
          Several people SCREAM as the figure CRASHES to the front of
          the cage. A WOLFMAN for lack of a better term, its body
          covered in thick, matted hair. It roars again, shakes the
          bars. Its half-canine teeth yellow, its eyes red. A chain
          hangs attached to an iron collar around its neck.
          Half the audience believe it's real. The other half are
          amazed at how real this 'performer' seems. As they buzz, Mr.
          Tall steps out on stage. Wearing red leather gloves and hat.MR. TALLLadies and Gentlemen. Welcome to
          the Cirque du Freak. We are an
          ancient circus. We have toured for
          five hundred years...14.Darren and Steve exchange a look at this information.MR. TALL.Bringing the remarkable and
          grotesque to generations. Our
          freaks are not people in masks.
          They are not harmless misfits.
          What you see tonight is real. Each
          performer unique. None harmless.
          To prove this, the Wolfman lunges, reaches a claw through the
          bars to swipe just centimeters short of Mr. Tall who's non-
          reaction shows he knows exactly where he's standing.
          A ripple goes through the crowd as they become aware of
          TRUSKA. Startlingly beautiful. Dressed for the Moulin
          Rouge. Crossing the stage in a languid catwalk. Several MEN
          in the audience begin to cough and shift in their seats.
          Even the Wolfman takes notice.MR. TALLBeauty and the beast.
          Truska approaches the cage, makes soothing motions, her upper
          body swaying. The Wolfman lulls to a trance.
          Two stage hands - MIDGETS apparently, hidden by blue robes,
          step out and start to push the cage off stage.
          Truska steps toward the audience, moving in the same
          languorous rhythm. And then: she begins to grow a BEARD.
          Hairs creeping from above her lip, curling from her chin.
          Some in the audience recoil.
          Darren and Steve trade grins. This is great. Then...
          From either wing of the stage come twin contortionists: SIVE
          & SERSA. They walk on their hands, their legs pulled back
          with their ankles cinched behind there necks.
          As Truska exits, Sive and Sersa meet in the middle. Like
          Hindu wrestlers they take turns, climbing up and down each
          other, look like one person with two fronts. They twist like
          pretzels, getting huge LAUGHS when they pretend to be stuck.
          As it goes on, RHAMUS TWOBELLIES pads out to watch. The
          floorboards creak under his feet. He must weigh 600 pounds.
          After a moment, he turns, walks toward the audience. The
          light leaves the contortionists and focuses on Rhamus.15.RHAMUSMy name is Rhamus Twobellies. And
          I do have two.
          He TRIPS, stumbles toward the edge of the stage. PEOPLE in
          the front row jump back to keep from being crushed. Rhamus
          stops short, LAUGHS at them. He was pretending. He's
          practically doubled-over, resting his hands on his haunches.
          More blue-robed MIDGETS roll out a CART covered with food and
          lots of other stuff. Rhamus grabs a GLASS BOTTLE of soda.
          Instead of opening it, he bites off the glass top, chews it
          and swallows. Soon he's eating food almost as fast as he can
          grab it. Disgusting, but great fun at the same time.
          Next, he holds up a couple of nuts and bolts. Then swallows
          them whole. He swings his belly around. You can hear the
          sound of metal shifting inside.
          The crowd recoils as he starts to regurgitate, spitting out
          BOLTS, NAILS, BOTTLE CAPS, a JACKKNIFE. They clatter on
          stage. Finally, a METAL LINK appears between his teeth.
          He pinches hold of it and pulls. A CHAIN starts out of his
          mouth, up from his belly. One foot...two...six feet in all.
          With a shrug he starts off stage, dragging it behind him.
          Darren & Steve break into applause. So does the audience.
          As Rhamus' chain slides out of sight, a SNAKE slides in. An
          enormous BOA CONSTRICTOR. Impossibly huge. It slithers out
          to the center of the stage, its tongue flicking in and out.
          A SPOTLIGHT flicks down from above. The snake stops, raises
          itself several feet off the ground as it looks up, seemingly
          transfixed by the light. But in reality...
          The end of a thick ROPE drops down. And moving (headfirst!)
          down the rope is a BOY. Very thin, his blonde hair tinged
          with green. This is EVRA VON. He moves smoothly, twists
          over backwards to set his feet down on the stage.
          Evra wears a sort of cloak which he suddenly spins out of.
          The audience GASPS... Wearing only shorts, Evra's body
          SPARKLES. He's covered in gold, blue and green scales!
          He moves a vaguely webbed hand through the air, charming the
          snake which raises itself higher still. He slowly slides
          forward till he and the boa are nearly eye-to-eye.
          Then Evra leans forward and KISSES the snake on the nose.16.DARREN & STEVEDARRENHe's as old as us.STAGEEvra starts to make a HISSING sound. In response, the snake
          begins corkscrewing around him like the stripes on a barber
          shop pole. Finally, it slithers around his neck, pulls back
          to look him in the eye. And then...
          Evra bends at the knees, lays down and starts to roll. Like
          he was wrapped in a snake carpet, he disappears stage left.
          More applause from the audience.
          Then the stage goes dark except for a small focused spot at
          the center. Everyone waits, but nothing happens until...
          Appearing literally out of nowhere - one instant there's
          nothing under the spot and the next instant there is --LARTEN CREPSLEY!Motionless, looking past the crowd. The only difference from
          his pictures is he's a bit older and a SCAR runs down his
          left cheek. It stretches his mouth up on that side.DARREN & STEVERecognize him. Can't believe their eyes. Steve pulls the
          print-out from his pocket, compares.DARRENIt's him...STAGECrepsley disappears! The crowd mumble nervously. And just
          as suddenly he's back! On the edge of the stage, lit by the
          footlights. This time he holds a draped BIRDCAGE.CREPSLEYIt's not true. That all tarantulas
          are poisonous. Though some can
          kill a man. With one bite.
          Crepsley whisks off the covering. In the cage: a TARANTULA
          the size of a large man's hand. So big you can make out
          individual eyes. As deadly looking as it is beautiful.DARRENReacts. A spider!17.STAGECrepsley makes the introduction.CREPSLEYHer name? Madam Octa. Pray that
          she never learns yours.
          Two of the blue-robed 'little people' lead a GOAT onto the
          stage. A ripple of worry runs through the crowd. Crepsley
          starts over. The goat BLEATS. The little people hold it.
          Mr. Crepsley flicks open the cage door with his finger. The
          spider sets its front legs on the bars, pulls itself through.
          A few gasps from the audience. The goat bucks.
          Madam Octa bares her fangs, poised to leap on her prey.
          Several audience members CRY OUT that this should stop.
          Crepsley looks out with mock-theatrical surprise.CREPSLEYNo...? Shall it be life?
          Chuckling to himself, he looks to the goat tenders. They
          release the goat which bee-lines its way off the stage.
          Crepsley faces the audience.CREPSLEYI wonder if you would be as shocked
          to see the same fate for me?
          Madam Octa moves -- climbing the outside of the cage --
          taking a cautious step onto the hand holding the cage, then
          starting up Crepsley's arm. He stands dead still.DARREN & STEVEHave a million questions, but right now the performance has
          their full edge-of-their-seat attention.STAGEMadam Octa has nearly reached Crepsley's left shoulder.CREPSLEYThough we have been together such a
          long time, she is no pet. I think
          she would quite enjoy killing me.
          Crepsley calmly raises his free hand. It holds a shiny TIN
          WHISTLE. Madam Octa has reaches his shoulder.18.CREPSLEYFor her bite there is no cure.
          Madam Octa bares her fangs, even longer now. Her malevolence
          about to be directed at her master.
          Crepsley carefully puts the whistle to his mouth and starts
          to play, as simple as it is evocative.
          Madam Octa hesitates. Then, she moves around his throat,
          starts to climb his face using his scar as her guide. She
          gets to the top of his head, stands in his shock of hair.
          She sways; she's dancing!
          Then she leaps, lands on the end of the whistle. Crepsley
          keeps playing as Madam Octa attaches a web, drops down about
          18 inches off the end. She starts to swing.
          Crepsley takes the whistle from his mouth and twirls it
          around. Octa does a few 360s and the thread breaks. She
          sails up high over Crepsley's head.
          He cranes back to watch as down she comes, legs splayed. She
          lands flat on his face. The whistle is in his hand.
          Crepsley looks out at the audience. Looking out between her
          hairy legs, his eyes are wide with horror.
          Without warning, the spotlight on him goes out. As the stage
          is plunged into darkness, we hear Crepsley SCREAM.
          A horrible, horrible sound. The audience wait, but nothing
          happens. Some of them rise from their seats, peer into the
          gloom. It's too dark.
          The sound of something being DRAGGED. Then nothing. A light
          comes up stage left as Mr. Tall steps out.MR. TALLThank you, ladies and gentlemen.
          That is the end of our show.AUDIENCE MANBut... What happened to him?!MR. TALLDon't you know? What happens to us
          all, can happen to any of us.
          That said, there's a crack of thunder and an explosion
          seemingly at Mr. Tall's feet. He's nowhere to be seen.19.The houselights come up. The stage is empty. Some in the
          audience start to clap. Others are a bit dismayed.
          Darren and Steve sit there as people start for the exits.DARRENLet's get outta here.STEVENo, you go. I'm staying.
          Steve starts down toward the stage. Darren follows.DARRENWait. What're you doing?
          Steve reaches the stage, looks around. The audience is
          mostly exited; no one from the Cirque is in sight.
          As Steve starts up onto the stage, Darren grabs his shoulder.
          Steve wheels, shoves Darren who stumbles back into a seat.STEVEThis is my destiny. Don't ruin it.
          Steve looks dangerous as he looms. Darren raises his hands
          in surrender. Steve eases off, but he's still intense.STEVEThat car today. It was a sign.
          Sending me here. I was told
          there'd be a sign.
          Too friggin' weird.DARRENTold by who? The guy in the chat
          room? The internet guy?STEVEI'll tell you later. If I can.
          Steve scrambles onto the stage and disappears into the back.
          Darren stands, whispers into the dark.DARRENSteve...
          Decision time. Darren climbs up, starts after his friend.CUT TO:20.INT. ZEITERION THEATER - BACKSTAGE - NIGHTDarren moves back into the gloom. Deserted, the junk casts
          sinister shadows. Then, a sound at his feet. Darren stops
          short. Sees that he's almost walked into an open stage DOOR
          IN THE FLOOR. The sound is someone moving below.DARRENSteve...?
          No answer. Darren decides, starts down steep, rickety steps.CUT TO:STEVE - UNDERSTAGE STORAGE AREAHe moves past a dilapidated stage elevator. Stumbles. As he
          heads further into the dark.DARRENComing down the creaky stairs. Spooky.DARRENSteve...CUT TO:STEVETurning a corner, is startled by what turns out to be a
          costume mannequin. But beyond: a LONG BOX set on two
          sawhorses. Coffin-sized. Empty, its lid propped up by it.
          The dust is tracked with footsteps. A mini-FRIDGE hums in a
          corner. Steve steps over, sees an EXTENSION CORD which runs
          up the wall, disappears into a hole punched in the ceiling.DARRENStops short as a LIGHT suddenly cuts through the gloom to his
          left. Darren steps over low behind a CREDENZA. He sees...STEVEHe's opened the door to the fridge. The little bulb inside
          pushes through the gloom, lighting the area up.DARRENReacts as MADAM OCTA tries to jump on his face! The bars of
          her CAGE stop her. It rests on the credenza he crouches
          behind. The whistle is there too. Darren looks over as...21.STEVEReaches in the fridge, takes out a glass jar that looks to be
          filled with BLOOD. Steve raises it, swirls it around inside.CREPSLEY'S VOICEAre you looking for me?
          Steve whirls -- drops the bottle -- SMASH!
          Standing behind him - dead still - CREPSLEY.DARRENRooted to the spot. Watching...STEVE & CREPSLEYCrespley sniffs the air - the spilled blood to be exact.STEVEI -- I know who you are.CREPSLEYTell me, boy. Who am I?STEVEYou're a vampire.CREPSLEYToo broad a definition. Do you
          introduce yourself as a human? Who
          I am is Larten Crepsley.DARRENMoving slightly to get a clearer view.STEVE & CREPSLEYCrepsley suddenly DISAPPEARS, REAPPEARS much closer. Steve
          jumps, twists around. Unnerved.CREPSLEYWho sent you and what do they want?STEVENothing. No one.
          Crepsley takes a moment to decide if he believes him.CREPSLEYThen what do you want?22.STEVEI want to join you.CREPSLEYJoin me? I don't understand.STEVEI want you to make me a vampire.
          Not what Crepsley (or Darren) expected. Steve stands there
          trying to look resolved. Crepsley is surprised, intrigued.CREPSLEYIs it because you want to live
          forever? Because we don't.STEVEI don't care about living forever.
          But you do seem to live a long
          time.CREPSLEYA long time alone. Do you want to
          live alone?STEVEI already do.CREPSLEYAre you an orphan?STEVEMy father's gone; my mother doesn't
          care about me.CREPSLEYNor mine. You're friendless also?STEVEI have a friend, but he doesn't
          understand. He's got too much to
          know what it's like to be alone.
          As Darren reacts to this...STEVEWhen you're alone you feel weak.
          Useless. But I know there must be
          something strong about it, too. I
          want to feel the power of being
          alone. I want to be a vampire.23.CREPSLEYThe power of being alone will never
          be greater than the weakness of it.STEVEI don't care.
          Crepsley's actually impressed, but after a moment he waves a
          dismissive hand.CREPSLEYIt makes no matter. We do not
          blood children. I'm sorry.
          Steve pulls a JACKKNIFE from his pocket, flips open the 2-
          inch blade. Crepsley laughs out loud.CREPSLEYDo you intend to use that on me?
          And we feel it more than see it, but Steve cuts into his own
          palm. He holds it up, moist and red in Crepsley's face.STEVEDo it. Make me a vampire.CREPSLEYDo not tempt me.DARRENCan't believe what he's watching. He sees Crepsley suddenly
          get 'scent' of something. Something to do with Steve's
          blood. Not quite a clear view as Crepsley grabs Steve's
          wrist, dabs a finger into his palm and then tastes it.CREPSLEYCrepsley shoves Steve down to the ground and immediately
          begins spitting onto the floor. Like it was poison.STEVEWhat's wrong?CREPSLEYYou have bad blood.STEVEWhat do you mean?24.CREPSLEYI can taste the menace in your
          blood. You can never be a vampire.
          You're evil.
          Steve scrambles to his feet.STEVEThat's a lie. You take that back!
          Crepsley draws himself full, his voice deadly.CREPSLEYGo home.
          Suddenly cowed, Steve just stands there blinking.CREPSLEYGO!Steve runs, disappears into the gloom. After a moment, we
          can hear him scurrying up the stairs. Then he's gone.DARRENFrozen to his spot, watches as Crepsley, seemingly ill, holds
          his head and spits again onto the floor. Then he steps over
          and kicks the fridge door closed.
          And in the blink of an eye, he's gone. Disappeared.
          Darren is alone. He starts out, then stops. Looks back.
          That beautiful spider. And Darren takes Madam Octa's cage
          and the whistle and makes a run for it. Just like that.CUT TO:EXT. STREETS - DARREN'S NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT3 AM. Dead quiet. Darren hurries home, cage in hand.
          Looking over his shoulder. So far so good. He nearly trips
          over an untied shoelace. He sets down the cage, to tie it.
          Madam Octa lunges across her cage at a WORM on the sidewalk.DARRENOh. You want that?
          Darren picks up the worm, lowers it between the bars. A beat
          and then Madam Octa snatches it away from him. Dinner.25.DARRENSee? I'm your friend... You're so
          beautiful I stopped thinking.
          The wind rustles. Darren grabs the cage, continues.CUT TO:EXT. THE SHAN HOUSE - NIGHTThe house dark. Holding the cage with one hand, Darren
          starts climbing the side of the house using the other. He
          avoids the broken section, but as he reaches the window:
          His Dad is standing there looking out. Busted.DADGet inside.
          From his angle, Darren's Dad can't see the cage in his son's
          hand. Darren hooks it over the end piece of part of the
          trellis and climbs in. Leaving the cage hanging behind.CUT TO:INT. DARREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHTDarren stands across from his Dad.DADA freak show? Are you kidding me?DARRENIt was down at the old Zeiterion

          Darren's Dad's suspicion is confirmed.26.DADSteve... We weren't going to tell
          you, but we think Steve stole money
          from your Mom's purse yesterday.DARRENHe wouldn't do that.DADMom's pretty sure about it.DARRENMan, what is this? You don't want
          me hanging around with him. Now
          you say you think he stole money?
          Do you know for sure?DADNo.DARRENSteve's had some bad times lately.
          I'm trying to be a good friend.DADBeing a good friend and sneaking
          out are two different things.DARRENI have to sneak out! You treat me
          like a kid!
          A moment as Darren's raised voice rings out of the room.DADThen act like an adult if that's
          how you want to be treated. This
          world is crossed by fences --
          Darren interrupts. He's heard it a million times.DARKENI know, I know. And you gotta
          decide which side you stand on.
          And you can't sit on it either.
          His Dad doesn't enjoy hearing his words thrown back at him.
          He starts for the door, looks back before exiting.DADA freak show. What do they do, put
          people in cages for everyone to
          laugh at?27.Darren feels bad, like a kid. He looks down at the floor.DARRENIt wasn't like that.
          A beat. Darren's Dad goes, closing the door. Darren sighs.
          He goes to the window, pulls up the cage. He scans a look
          outside. Except for his Dad, the coast is clear.CUT TO:INT. CLOSET - DARREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHTDarren sets the cage on a shelf, shuts the door. Black.CUT TO:INT. KITCHEN - SHAN HOUSE - MORNINGDarren's Mom making omelettes. Darren's DAD helping, dicing

          A KNOCK at the kitchen door. Annie gets up, opens the door
          to reveal: Steve. From his angle he can only sees Annie.STEVEHey, midget, where's the idiot?
          Annie motions Steve in. He stops short when he see everyone

          Steve gives him a look. A weird tension in the air. Darren

          Darren steps over, starts his computer up. While waiting,

          Steve switches it on. Something occurs to Darren too late...DARRENLet me see that --
          On the screen: the PHOTO OF MADAM OCTA. Steve twists around

          That you wanted to be a vampire.
          Steve doesn't want to talk about it. He looks at Madam Octa.STEVEHow do you think he made her do
          what he wanted?
          Darren opens his desk drawer, pulls out the flute.DARRENI wish I knew how to play it.STEVEI think that was just for show. I
          think he used something else. Some
          kind of mind control.DARRENYou mean telepathy?STEVEI bet anyone with a brain could do
          it. Which leaves you out.
          Steve smiles, gives Darren a little punch in the arm. The
          tension is loosening. They react to a KNOCK on the door.ANNIE'S VOICECan I come in?
          Darren goes to the door. Opens it a few inches.DARRENI swear to God, Annie...ANNIEWhat? I knocked.

          Annie freezes. Darren grabs a BASEBALL BAT which leans in
          the corner. He reaches out, pokes at the curtain with it.
          Madam Octa drops down onto the window sill -- WHAM! Wood
          cracks as Darren brings down the bat, but Madam Octa is too
          quick. She disappears, leaping out the open window!

          The change is too extreme. And if

          inexperience would. So you become
          one in stages. A half-vampire at

          take it.CREPSLEYYes or no?
          Thoughts rush, then stop. Darren finally just nods.
          Crepsley raises his right hand. The nails are not especially
          long, but they look thick and sharp.
          Crepsley takes Darren's hand, jabs at his forefinger, draws
          blood. He dabs off a drop, smells it, then tastes it.CREPSLEYYou have good blood.
          Crepsley lifts his own left hand. He presses the nails of
          his right into the fleshy tips of his left hand fingers.
          Then he uses the left nails to mark the right fingers in the
          same way. Blood drips down all ten fingers.CREPSLEYLift your hands.
          Darren does as he's told. Crepsley digs all ten nails into
          all ten of Darren's fingertips. Darren jerks back in pain.CREPSLEYGet used to pain. More lies ahead.
          He motions to his hands. Darren raises them, fingers spread.
          Crepsley presses his fingertips to Darren's. Blood brothers.

          A force arcs through Darren's body. He screams, falls down.39.Crepsley turns away, starts to lick the blood from his

          Darren takes hold. Crepsley starts to move. Only it seems
          more like he's still and the ground is moving under his feet.
          Darren looks about as the building begin to streak past, the
          road a blurred ribbon. The night has a weird chromatic look.

          minutes left.
          Crepsley takes a small AMBER VIAL from his pocket. He breaks
          a wax seal then pinches out a small blackened cork.
          He pulls the drip line out of the IV CATHETER and empties a
          drop of the vial's dark, viscous contents inside. It swirls
          murkily, coloring the liquid on its way into Steve's arm.
          A beat and then Steve seems to convulse, his arms and legs
          twitching. Is he dying?DARRENWhat's happening?CREPSLEYHe was near death. The journey

          And then Steve comes around. He opens his eyes, focuses on
          Darren for a moment. He looks puzzled.STEVEDarren?
          And then he drifts off, asleep. His breathing growing

          drastically they won't find a

          days. Vampires don't stay broken
          for long and it takes a very long

          embalm me or something?CREPSLEYDon't worry. I have ways of making
          my thoughts become the thoughts of
          others. They'll leave you alone.50.Crepsley gestures to the window. Knowing the plan, Darren
          climbs out, his foot resting on the trellis. He looks to the
          ground, back to Crepsley as an odd thought hits him.DARRENMy dad's allergic to grass. It's
          my job to cut the lawn.CREPSLEYYou have a new job now. Drink.
          Darren steels himself, gulps it down, hands the bottle back.DARRENSo this is destiny, huh? Tastes
          like crap.
          Darren body seizes up. He lets go, but Crepsley grabs him.CREPSLEYYour breathing is slowing, your
          heart as well. Do you feel it?

          Crepsley is digging the coffin back up. Effortlessly.
          Finally, he spreads his feet apart, pulls open the lid.
          Darren sputters as some of the dirt spills onto his face.
          Crepsley reaches down, pulls him up and out of the grave.
          Darren sits on the ground, coughing then moaning.CREPSLEYOn your feet.DARRENMy legs are asleep.54.Crepsley pulls him up anyhow. Darren stumbles a few steps,
          nearly falls before finding his balance.CREPSLEYWalk it off. I'll fill this back
          in. Go. Breathe some air.
          Crepsley closes the coffin, begins to fill the hole as Darren
          ambles off. Not exactly the start of his best day.MOVE WITH DARRENPassing among the graves, stretching his arms, twisting.
          Really beat up. He looks about, the names and dates on the
          headstones popping into focus even from far away. Night
          vision. Suddenly he becomes aware of something:
          Steve. On the other side of a mausoleum. Ten feet away.DARRENWhat are you doing here?STEVE(smiles; closing in)
          Vampire hunting.
          Steve rushes the last step, a jagged WOODEN STAKE held high
          over his head. He knocks Darren back on the ground.
          Pouncing on top, he brings down the stake.
          Darren catches hold of Steve's wrist. Stops the point of the
          stake just over his heart. Steve puts his weight into it. A
          desperate moment of struggle, but Darren's strength is
          resurgent. He throws Steve off.
          Steve rolls to his feet, comes at him again. Darren catches
          his wrist with one hand, his throat with the other. He slams
          him up against the mausoleum, holds him there.DARRENWhat do you have against vampires?
          You wanted to become one yourself.STEVEYeah, I wanted to, but you did.
          You stole my dream. You stole my
          destiny.DARRENAre you crazy? I did it to save
          your life. That was the deal. Me
          for you.55.STEVE(UNHINGING)Liar. You told him I was evil.
          You planned this all along. And
          you'll pay! You'll pay --
          Darren jams the stake under Steve's throat. That stops him
          struggling. The points jabs him as he swallows.DARRENI want you to leave...
          Steve is just beginning to realize how strong Darren is now.DARRENI want you to leave and forget you
          ever saw me. Understand?
          Scared, he nods. Darren shoves him away, brakes the stake in
          two. Steve heads away, looks back over his shoulder.STEVEI'm going to hunt you, Darren. You
          and the other one. Crepsley. I'll
          put a stake in you and burn you to
          ashes. I'll make sure you never
          come back from the grave again.
          WHAM. Steve walks right into Crepsley. He picks Steve up by
          the shoulders, pulls him close. With a voice like Death...CREPSLEYIf we ever meet again, I will show
          you loneliness you cannot imagine.
          Steve trembles in fear. Crepsley lets go. Steve takes off
          running. Crepsley looks to Darren.CREPSLEYDo you still question his blood?
          Darrenthoughtful, doesn't know what to think.DARRENWould a stake through the heart
          kill a vampire?CREPSLEYYes. But so would getting hit by a
          truck if it was going fast enough.

          start?
          Darren hesitates, looks to the twinkling lights of his city.CREPSLEYYou'll get used to it after awhile.

          hours of exposure. I'd have plenty

          years old. In 1794.DARREN1794?CREPSLEYIn Paris. The days of the Terror.
          Heads in baskets. Guillotines up

          vampire now for 211 years. Hmm?
          Darren nods again, still with him.CREPSLEYI age 1 year for every 10, so, 211
          divided by 10, I've aged about 21
          years in that time. That 21 plus
          my first human 20 makes me look
          about 40.DARRENBut altogether you're 211 plus 20.
          You're really 231 years old.CREPSLEYExactly. You're going to be a
          teenager for a very long time.
          They walk on a few steps as Darren thinks this over.DARRENWhere do you keep your car anyhow?CREPSLEYWhat car?DARRENThe one you were driving around my
          town in. The old black one.CREPSLEYI've never owned a car, Darren. I

          Only nobody's there. She shrugs it off, closes the back
          door. But hesitates at the driver's side door. Then she
          starts walking away, toward a back area of loading docks.CUT TO:DARREN & CREPSLEYWatch from a dumpster by the loading dock. She walks right

          But the air shimmers and Crepsley has disappeared.
          The woman steps up, stops across from Darren. As she frowns,
          tries to figure out who he is and how she got here...DARRENGo. Run.
          But Crepsley appears beside her. He 'breathes' into his

          passes out. Darren is horrified.DARRENDid you kill her?CREPSLEYI put her to sleep. She'll be like

          control himself. One who drinks
          only when he must can end up
          feeding wildly.
          He uses one of his fingernails to open the vein.CREPSLEYThe hunger inside us must be fed to

          It's what separates us from... the
          others.DARRENWhat others?
          But as blood oozes, he takes the woman's wrist td his mouth.
          Darren is repulsed, but can't look away. Crepsley takes a
          few deep swallows, then holds the wrist out to Darren.CREPSLEYYour turn.DARRENNo. I won't.CREPSLEYDarren...DARRENI'll never do it.
          Crepsley runs his tongue over the cut, rubs the saliva in.CREPSLEYYou can lead a vampire to blood,

          tonight, but you must feed soon.
          Crepsley stands to go, then stops short. Tense, he looks
          about, more hunted animal than man. As he shrugs it off.DARRENWhat is it?
          As the woman starts to stir...CREPSLEYNothing. Let's go.DARRENSomething out there scares you.

          albino white with purplish mottling and red crisscrossing
          veins. He must weigh 300 pounds, but NFL nose tackle style.MURLOUGHSmell the blood. The lovely blood.
          His eyes narrow at the sight of Crepsley, his mouth widening
          to show two rows of sharp filthy teeth.
          Darren needs to do something. He eyes the watch in Mr.
          Tiny's hand. He grabs it with his free hand, thumbs back in
          the winding knob. As Murlough disappears from view...
          The WINDOW EXPLODES as Sinewy Two hurtles out.
          Darren tosses the watch high in the air. Mr. Tiny releases
          him to move to catch it.
          Darren rushes back toward the restaurant.
          Mr. Tiny catches his watch.
          Crepsley meets Darren. Crepsley's broken arm hangs uselessly
          from his side.
          Murlough appears alongside. He grabs Crepsley by the throat,
          lifts him off the ground.
          Crepsley arcs the knife into Murlough's shoulder.

          Crepsley slows. Just as Murlough's about to catch him from

          the blind corner, become a PICK-UP - broadsiding Murlough!
          He goes up over the hood, SMASHES against the windshield.
          As Darren and Murlough disappear again...68.The pick-up brakes. Murlough doesn't. He tumbles off the
          hood, sprawls hard into and skids along the street.
          A beat and he rolls to a sitting position, looks around. No
          Crepsley in sight. Blood runs out of one of his ears. As he
          wipes it, smearing it across his cheek...PICK-UP DRIVER(RUSHING OVER)Hey, man, are you okay?!
          He stops short when he sees Murlough's face. Murlough

          rumbles a low, guttural growl.
          Darren is so taken that he almost walks into...
          Madam Truska. He stops short. In costume, beardless, even
          more beautiful than when we first saw her. She considers
          Darren, uses a finger to raise his chin. She shakes her

          One night I looked out of my cage
          and saw Mr. Tall just standing
          there. He watched me until the
          owner came over and asked if he
          could help him. Mr. Tall grabbed
          him by the throat and strangled him
          to death. Then he opened the cage
          and said, "Let's go, Evra." He

          attaches a web thread. The audience react as she leaps to
          Crepsley's shoulder and attaches the other end. She dances

          hand. A few moments later, the two of them are engaged in a
          mad TANGO. It takes the camp's collective breath away.

          Gavner LAUGHS out loud, catches himself.GAVNER PURLThe only thing drinking blood will
          do to you is keep you alive.DARRENThat's how it would start. I would
          swear it was just to stay alive.
          But what'll I turn into? You're on
          one side of the fence or the other.
          My father used to say that and now
          I know what he meant.
          The 'father part' chokes Darren up a bit.84.GAVNER PURLYou've already turned, Darren. You
          need to accept what you've already
          become. There's no going back.
          They walk in silence a moment. Then:DARRENWhy did Crepsley make himself an
          exile anyhow?GAVNER PURLHe was tired of all the killing.
          We were at war.DARRENWith the vampaneze?GAVNER PURLCrepsley was once a Vampire
          General. One of our great leaders.
          He may seem reluctant, but I assure
          you, no one is as skilled at
          killing vampaneze than Crepsley is.
          I think that's why they'd like to
          get him out of the way. Kill him
          off before the new war starts.DARRENYou've known him a long time?GAVNER PURLI was his assistant. He blooded
          me, as he blooded you.
          There's almost something comforting in this news. Gavner
          Purl so proud and strong looking. Darren wants to know...DARRENWhy'd he choose you?GAVNER PURLTo teach me to kill vampaneze. Up
          until now, it's the only reason he
          ever chooses anyone.DARRENIs it why he chose me?
          Gavner hesitates, not sure.85.GAVNER PURLThat's for Crepsley to say. Not
          me.
          Another brick wall, but Darren accepts it.GAVNER PURLDo you know what the biggest danger
          is to a vampire, Darren?DARRENThe vampaneze? Mr. Tiny?GAVNER PURLNo. It's that they live so long
          they no longer care. Everything
          they love is left behind until they
          finally have nothing left to live
          for. Except death. The fact that
          he's taken an apprentice seems, to
          me, a good sign. A sign that he's
          thinking of living not dying.DARRENLucky for me. Glad I could help.
          All the same Darren considers what he's heard. Gavner,
          meanwhile, considers the open countryside ahead.GAVNER PURLA clear run. Good.
          Gavner gives Darren one last appraising look.GAVNER PURLStay by him, Darren. Stay by him.
          Gavner takes a deep breath. The air around him shimmers, his
          image bouncing in and out of phase like an electron heating
          up. And then he's gone.DARRENThat part is definitely cool.CUT TO:EXT. THE SUN - DAYHigh in the noon sky. PAN DOWN to where Darren stands under

          But Evra and Darren are not laughing.EVRAWhat're you doing here?DEBBIEWe could ask you the same thing.
          We come here all the time. My

          Evra steps into a slash of sunlight and his skin flashes to
          life, the green of his scales catching the rays. Debbie's
          mouth drops. They couldn't see it in the dark last night.EVRAEveryone has a place they belong.

          That wins Evra over.DEBBIECan I touch it?
          Evra holds out his arm. Debbie traces a finger across it.DEBBIEWow. Has it always been this way?DARRENHe's a snake-boy.DEBBIEYou shouldn't call him names
          because he looks different.EVRAIt's okay. I am a snake boy.SAMYou could say you're
          dermatologically challenged.
          They all LAUGH. Debbie considers Evra a beat, then Darren.DEBBIEWhat about you, Darren? How are
          you different?89.DARRENI get scared easy.
          Darren looks up toward the rafters. From where she dropped.DARRENHow'd you get up there anyhow?DEBBIEYou mean, how did a girl get up
          there?CUT TO:EXT. FACTORY ROOF - DAYA spot where the roofing is gone, several long RAFTERS
          stretch out. Darren, Evra and Sam watch Debbie walk out on
          one. Like a balance beam. The factory floor 70 feet below.EVRAHey, be careful.SAMDon't worry. She's like a gymnast.
          Debbie moves slowly at first, her arms stretched out for
          balance. Then she does a hop, a skip. Darren and Evra gasp.
          She gets to the other side, turns and bows.DARRENYou're crazy!DEBBIEHow about you?DARRENI got nothing to prove.DEBBIEBut it'd be easier for you than me.DARRENWhy's that?DEBBIEBecause chickens have wings.
          She starts chicken CLUCKING. Mad, Darren steps onto a
          rafter, starts across. He stops in the middle, spins around.
          Aided immeasurably by his half-vampire skills.90.Debbie is impressed.ANGLE OVERHEADThe vertigo angle as Debbie walks back out on her rafter.

          me. Like this.
          Debbie crosses her arms the same way Darren has. He
          uncrosses them as he realizes.
          Debbie reaches down, touches her toes. Darren sighs, then
          does the same, gets a good look at the floor below.
          Debbie takes one foot off the rafter, takes hold of the top
          of it with one hand, raising the other arm out for balance.
          Looks like a ballerina.
          Evra doesn't like this daredevil stuff.EVRACome on, guys...
          Darren hesitates. Not because he won't do it, but because
          maybe for the first time in his life, he's really fascinated
          by a girl. Debbie misreads, starts CLUCKING again.
          Darren smiles, repeats her move effortlessly.
          Without warning, Debbie leaps the gap, lands on the rafter
          alongside Darren. As she struggles a bit for balance, Darren
          reaches out and steadies her. As they come face to face.DEBBIEThere definitely something
          different about you. I just can't
          figure it out.DARRENIs Sam your boyfriend?91.DEBBIEHe's my cousin.DARRENOh...
          A funny, awkward beat out on the rafter. Finally...DARRENWe should get off this.
          She nods, a bit smitten. Darren turns. As they start off...DARRENChalk it up to lack of blood, but everything starts spinning.DARREN'S POVThe area is like a big drain and he's whirling down it.RAFTERDarren legs go out and he falls off. As Debbie screams...
          Darren CATCHES HOLD of the rafter just as he drops past it.DEBBIEHold on.
          Debbie grabs his arm. Evra starts out to help, but the
          rafter CREAKS OMINOUSLY. He stops. Sam states the obvious.SAMI don't think it'll hold you, dude.EVRAThanks for the heads up... Bro.DARREN(shakes it off)
          It's okay. I'm okay.
          Darren swings up a leg, hooks it over the rafter. A beat and
          he's back on top. Debbie relieved. Evra backs up the way he
          came and in a few seconds they're all safely off the rafter.DEBBIEI don't know how you hung on. I
          couldn't have.DARRENYou wouldn't have fallen in the
          first place... I just got dizzy.92.DEBBIEMaybe you need to eat something.
          Darren looks at her. She has no idea.EVRAWell, the food's down on ground
          level. Let's get out of here.
          Sam and Debbie start off, Darren and Evra following. As Sam
          and Debbie start down a ladder, Darren hangs back a beat.DARRENShe's kind'of cool, huh? I mean,
          for a girl.EVRAI like her. She asks a lot of

          here willing to save you.

          Darren stands there as noble and sad as a boy could be.DARRENI am human. In my heart I am.

          thing Crepsley needed to see. He's defeated.CUT TO:INT. FACTORY SPACE - NIGHTPeople in their seats or taking them. Darren is back in his
          role as usher. He seats two people, wipes at the sweat
          beading on his forehead. He's getting sicker.
          He sees Debbie. She and Sam are already seated across the
          way. She smiles, waves. Darren forces a smile,, waves back.
          Looking for more patrons, Darren nearly walks into... A
          FIGURE. A hat pulled down obscures his face.VOICEAn usher in the house of usher.
          And I can't seem to find a seat.
          Darren frowns at the odd voice, but leads down the aisle.DARRENThis way.
          Darren brings him down to a handful of seats. The figure
          looks up from under the brim of his hat. It's Mr. Tiny.MR. TINYJoin me.DARRENI don't think so.
          As Darren moves to go, Mr. Tiny clamps a hand around his
          wrist. Like iron. He sits, pulling Darren down beside him.96.MR. TINYIt's time we had a few moments.

          Mr. Tall's voice speeds to a BUZZ as he 'keystone cops' off
          the stage and Rhamus 'keystones' on. The audience's small
          movements become rattles and shakes.
          Only Darren and Mr. Tiny are at normal speed.MR. TINYI'm not so complicated, Darren.
          During war there are those who

          vampires and vampaneze will be
          decided by a child. That's why the
          vampires won't blood children. To
          avoid the end of the world.

          A charge. Murlough a bull, Crepsley a matador. He redirects
          one of Murlough's arcing arms, smashing it against a metal
          housing. One of the vampaneze's knives clatters away.
          It's not graphic or bloody, but several times Crepsley's

          inadvertently backs his way into a corner.

          She backs away, takes off up a rickety stairway. The wolfman
          HOWLS, then follows.
          Darren's too weak to follow, near tears in frustration and
          regret. He watches after them, then he looks over at Sam.

          Debbie moves to go after Murlough from behind. She's going
          to go down fighting as well. But Steve intercepts her. He's
          pretty powerful himself.
          Murlough pulls Darren to his feet, stands him up. He swings
          his fist in a vicious arc.
          Darren just ducks it and Murlough's fist SMASHES right
          through the wall (an inside wall) alongside Darren's head.
          Murlough's getting tired of Darren.MURLOUGHYou need to stand still so you can
          die.
          But as he attempts to pull his arm back through, he can't.
          He frowns. Then his eyes widen in pain.
          Murlough jerks his arm back as hard as he can. The wall
          smashes open as Murlough brings his arm back through with
          Crepsley hanging onto the end of it.FACTORY SPACEThe audience who remain chanting: "Refund! Refund!" They

          hard into an I-beam pillar. Again. Then he squeezes. We
          can hear the cartilage crunching in Crepsley's throat.
          But Crepsley covers his own right hand with his left. He
          drives the knife blade INTO MURLOUGH'S HEART!
          Murlough looks down at the handle of the knife, then back at
          Crepsley whose throat he still holds.
          Murlough gives him a lopsided grin and then pitches back,

          It sounds like he does. Darren looks intently at Debbie.

          Understanding, Debbie tears herself away. To the precipice.
          But instead of falling, she continues out on a rafter.
          Steve slides out after her. But as he reaches for her, she
          deftly skips across the rafters, jumps back to the floor.
          Before Steve can follow, Darren cuts him off. Below them:
          rows of jagged, rusty pipes. The remains of a pumping
