THE HANGOVERWritten byJon Lucas & Scott MooreSeptember 30, 2007EXT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB -- PACIFIC PALISADES, CA -- MORNINGIt's a beautiful spring morning in the Palisades. High atop
          the cliffs, looking out over the Pacific Ocean, sits the
          exclusive BEL AIR BAY CLUB. Workers bustle about the lawn,
          setting up a high-end wedding.
          A STRING QUARTET warms up. A team of FLORISTS arrange
          centerpieces. CATERERS set the white linen tables...INT. BRIDAL SUITE -- DAYA simple, classic wedding dress hangs on a closet door in
          this sun-drenched bridal suite. Sitting at the makeup table,
          surrounded by her bridesmaids, is the beautiful bride, TRACY
          TURNER, 20's. She's busy doing her makeup.
          Just then, Tracy's rich, stern FATHER, 50's, blows in.MR. TURNERAny word from Doug?
          The way he spits out "Doug" tells us all we need to know
          about how Mr. Turner feels about his future son-in-law.TRACYNo, but I'm sure he's--
          Just then, Tracy's CELLPHONE rings. She quickly answers it.TRACY (CONT'D)Hello?INTERCUT WITH:EXT. MOJAVE DESERT -- MORNINGHeat-waves rise off the Mojave. Standing at a lone, dust-
          covered payphone in the middle of the desert isVICK LENNONHe's in his late 20's, tall, rugged -- and currently a mess.
          His shirt is ripped open, his aviator sunglasses are bent,
          his lip is bloodied, and he clearly hasn't slept in days.VICKTracy, it's Vick.
          Parked on the dirt road behind Vick is his near-totalled 1967
          Cadillac Deville convertible; it's scratched, dented, filthy -
          - and missing its passenger side door.
          Slouched inside are TWO OTHER GUYS, also looking like hell.2.TRACYHey Vick!VICKListen, honey...The bachelor party
                    got a little out of control and,
                    well...we lost Doug.TRACY(her jaw dropping)
                    What?! But we're getting married in
                    like four hours!
          Vick squints at the rising sun.VICKYeah, that's not gonna happen.CUT TO:TITLE OVER BLACK: 40 HOURS EARLIERCUT TO:EXT. THE 10 FREEWAY -- DAYThe top down, The Who's "Baba O'Riley" blasting from the
          stereo, Vick's pristine Cadillac convertible rockets down
          Highway 10 towards Nevada.
          At the wheel is Vick, looking as sharp as his Caddy in a half-
          open shirt and mint condition aviators.
          Sitting shotgun is the groom, DOUG BILLINGS, late 20's,
          handsome, barefoot, crunchy -- an all around great guy.
          Behind Vick sits ALAN MERVISH, late 20's, an anal tax
          attorney from Connecticut, his Izod shirt tucked into his
          khakis. He's currently applying sun screen to his forehead.
          Next to Alan is STU PRYCE, late 20's, former high school
          linebacker and lovably dimwitted father of two. He drums the
          back of the frontseat to the music, totally pumped, like this
          is his first time out of the house in years. Because it is.STUDude this is already the best
                    weekend ever!VICKStu, relax, we're still on the 10.3.STUOh, did I show you pictures of my
                    kids?!DOUGNo, dude, show `em.
          Stu fishes pictures out of his wallet and eagerly shows them
          to Doug in the front seat. Doug is clearly the core of this
          group, the glue that holds these childhood friends together.STUHaylee is two, and Kaitlin is
                    already four! Can you believe it?!DOUG(smiling at photos)
                    How cute... Good for you, man.
          Doug shows the photos to Vick; he nods, impressed.VICKThe one on the left is gonna be a
                    hottie. The other one, not so much.
          Stu protectively snatches the photos back, muttering:STUJesus, dude, those are my children--ALAN(re: sunscreen)
                    Hey, am I rubbed in?
          Stu glances over and sees un-rubbed-in sunscreen all over
          Alan's face.STUYeah, you're good.DOUGHey so Alan, are you and Becky
                    still together?
          But before Alan can answer--VICKOf course they are, Doug. Jesus,
                    Alan's been dating Becky for 14
                    years. When they first met, Alan
                    had braces and soccer hair, and
                    Becky had a functioning hymen.(MORE)4.VICK (CONT'D)Asking Alan if he's still with
                    Becky is like asking the sun if it
                    still rises in the east.
          The guys try not to laugh; Alan scowls.DOUGShe still pressuring you to get
                    married?ALANEnh, we've moved past the pressure
                    stage...it's more like aggravated
                    assault stage now? Like at the last
                    wedding we went to, she threw a
                    camera at my head, called me a
                    closet fag, then ran out crying.
          The guys wince, oooo.ALAN (CONT'D)But we talked, and everything's
                    cool now.STUMaybe you could wear a helmet to
                    Doug's wedding.ALANGreat idea, Stu. Thanks.DOUG(LAUGHING)So Vick, how's business going?VICKOh, great. Yeah, I'm working on
                    bringing the next big dessert craze
                    to Los Angeles. It's gonna be huge.DOUGWhat is it?VICKBavarian custard. We ran the
                    numbers, and it's gonna be bigger
                    than fro yo.
          Doug and Stu nod, impressed; only Alan looks skeptical.ALANIsn't custard like a trillion
                    calories--?5.VICKOur plan is to open three stores in
                    the Valley and then franchise it.
                    Shares are selling fast, but I can
                    probably squeeze you guys in...DOUGYeah, man, count me in.STUMe too, man! I love pudding!
          Alan just shakes his head, unbelievable.ALANIs this gonna do better than the
                    hip-hop label you started, Vick? Or
                    the topless sushi bar? Or the
                    mobile tattoo parlor--?VICKTattoo-To-You was an idea ahead of
                    it's time, Alan! And don't come
                    crying to me when there's a Custard
                    Cabana on every street corner in
                    America and you didn't buy in--!DOUG(LAUGHING)All right, all right, save it for
                    the party...
          Vick and Alan quiet. Stu is still drumming the seat.STUDude! I can't believe I get to
                    party all night, and then, tomorrow
                    ...I get to sleep in! It's almost
                    too much! And FYI, if anyone gets
                    really drunk and craps themself,
                    just let me know, I can have you
                    cleaned up and partying again in
                    under three minutes. No joke. I am
                    a master of stool removal...
          They rocket off into the desert, LAUGHING...CUT TO:TITLE CARD: "FRIDAY, 5:12 PM"6.EXT. LAS VEGAS -- MAGIC HOURAs the last rays of sun fade, the Cadillac crests the final
          hill to reveal LAS VEGAS in all its illuminated splendor...EXT. LAS VEGAS BLVD. -- SUNSETThe Caddy rolls down the famed Strip. We are again reminded
          of the absurd scale of Las Vegas. The 5,000 room hotels, the
          eight lane roads, the 60 foot billboards...EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- NIGHTThe Caddy rolls up to the Mandalay Bay. The guys hop out,
          exhilarated. Vick throws the key to the VALET...INT. MANDALAY BAY -- NIGHTThe guys enter the glittering casino four men-wide, all
          smiling, all exuding vibe. Passing WOMEN sneak glances. Vick

          Vick strides up, smiling, sunglasses still on.FRONT DESK MANWelcome to the Mandalay Bay.VICKChecking in. Lennon comma Victor.
          The man types into his computer.FRONT DESK MANYes, we have you down for a one
                    night stay in an economy suite--
          Vick glances at the man's nametag; it reads "ATASHIR."VICKHold it right there, Atashir. This
                    is my best friend from childhood,
                    Douglas Billings. In two days, he
                    is to marry a woman of great beauty
                    and strong teeth, do you
                    understand? A woman of gigantic
                    bosoms who will give him many, many
                    sons...
          Atashir looks confused. Alan looks embarrassed.7.VICK (CONT'D)My two other childhood friends have
                    travelled great distances, across
                    many deserts, to be here. This
                    isn't a night in a hotel for us,
                    Atashir: this is a family reunion.
                    Perhaps you too have family
                    situated great distances away, in a
                    foreign country with much sand?
          Atashir looks like, sort of...? Vick reaches over the counter
          and touches his arm, simpatico.VICK (CONT'D)Then I have but one question for
                    you, friend: if they came to town,
                    would you put them in an economy
                    suite?ATASHIRNo, sir.VICKWell, then. I think one of us needs
                    to get back on his little computer
                    and find us a suitable room.
          Atashir frowns...but types away at his computer.ATASHIRAll the deluxe rooms are taken. The
                    Dean Martin suite is available, but
                    I'd have to ask my--VICKDean-o will be fine. Send up a case
                    of Cristal, two bottles of Patron,
                    four ahi sandwiches, and a crate of
                    skinless mangos...
          Vick turns to the guys:VICK (CONT'D)You guys want anything?
          The guys stammer, too stunned to speak.VICK (CONT'D)And have Jean-Marie cook up a dozen
                    of those duck skewers I like so
                    well. He knows the ones.ATASHIRAnd how would you like to pay?8.VICKAmerican Express.
          Atashir looks up to accept the card. After a beat, Vick turns
          to Alan:VICK (CONT'D)Dude, give him your AmEx.ALANWhat?VICKDon't worry, we'll hit you later.
          Alan stammers.VICK (CONT'D)Dude, come on, I paid for gas. Stop
                    being such a Jew.
          Alan stammers some more -- then angrily pulls out his card.CUT TO:INT. THE DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- NIGHTThe guys enter the room, jostling; Stu has Doug in a
          headlock. Then they freeze: the Dean Martin Suite is massive,
          complete with lounge area, two flat screen TVs, full bar and
          multiple bedrooms. The guys just gape.STUThis is bigger than my house.
          Vick blows past them, totally unfazed.VICKGet dressed, ladies. We're wheels
                    up in ten.
          Stu and Doug race off to find their bedrooms, leaving Alan
          standing alone, just staring at the decadent suite.ALANI am so not getting paid back.INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHTVick enters the bedroom, drops his bag, and starts changing
          his shirt -- when his cell phone RINGS. He answers.VICKThis is Vick.9.Vick listens -- then grows a bit panicked:VICK (CONT'D)He's in Vegas?! You're kidding me!(WINCING)All right, I'll get it. All right.
                    All right--!
          When Stu walks past, Vick turns away and covers the phone,
          trying to keep the call confidential:VICK (CONT'D)I said all right, dude! How many
                    more times you want me to say all
                    right?!(BEAT)All right. All right.

          selects a facial wash from his highly organized toiletries
          kit and begins washing his face.ALANSo, you ready for Sunday?DOUGYeah. I thought I'd be nervous, but
                    I'm actually just really psyched.
          Alan nods, impressed.ALANTracy's dad still hate you?DOUGOh yeah.ALANAny closer to figuring out why?DOUGEnh, I think he wanted more for his
                    girl. I mean, I'm a teacher who
                    makes 45 grand a year, and he's a
                    titan of industry who makes 45
                    grand a day, you know? I sort of
                    get it...

                    not sure you ever get past that.10.Alan smiles, yeah, there's that. Doug spits out his paste.DOUG (CONT'D)You got floss?
          Alan gestures towards his toiletries kit. Doug picks it up,
          starts looking for the floss. Then Alan remembers something --
          but it's too late. Doug has found the RING BOX inside Alan's
          kit, and opened it to reveal a HUGE DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING.DOUG (CONT'D)Holy Christ!
          Alan quickly reaches for the ring--ALANAhhh yeah, I wasn't going to tell
                    anyone about that--
          Just then, Stu wanders in, wearing only his COLORADO STATE
          BOXER SHORTS. His gut is sizable.STUAnyone got any nipple lube--?
                        (seeing ring)

          Stu grabs the ring from Doug.DOUGIt's Alan's. For Becky.STUJesus, who made this thing? Diddy?ALAN(clutching for ring)
                    Actually, I-I was trying to keep it
                    a secret, so--
          Just then Vick blows in, singing, effeminate:VICKBoy Party in the bathrooooom--!

                    for you! Where'd you get the ring?ALANOh, it's a family heirloom. My
                    grandmother smuggled it through the
                    Holocaust, actually. I was going to
                    propose to Beck this weekend.

          and file out onto the flat tar roof of the Mandalay Bay; Vick
          is carrying a bottle of Patron and four hotel glasses.
          Bringing up the rear, Alan slides a wood block between the
          door and the frame so they aren't locked up here.
          The guys step out onto the dark, windy roof and take in the
          stunning panorama...the Strip...the mountains...the countless

                    spend the rest of her life with me.
                    I think both will prove to be
                    massive errors of judgement on her
                    part.
          The guys chuckle, hear-hear.DOUG (CONT'D)And to being here, with my best

          the word ASSHOLE written in Sharpie across his chest, is Stu.TITLE CARD: "SATURDAY, 11:15AM"The chicken struts across the top of the couch, until it
          reaches a plastic coin cup from Bellagio blocking its path.
          Beat. Then the chicken pecks it off...onto Stu.
          The cup hits Stu in the face, and stale beer splashes all
          over him. Stu spastically jerks awake and flips off the
          couch, onto a pile of newspapers.PILE OF NEWSPAPERSOWW! Get off! Get off! Jesus!
          Confused, Stu clambers off the pile of newspapers -- to find
          Vick sleeping underneath, on the floor, fully dressed. Vick
          pulls himself onto the couch, clearly in pain.VICKDamn, dude, why are you retarded?
          Both men are ragingly hungover.
          A long beat as both of them rub their faces, then:VICK (CONT'D)Um, Stuey?STUYo.VICKWhy do you have a mullet?
          Stu does, in fact, have a mullet haircut. But he's too
          hungover to understand.STUWhat?15.VICKYou know, business on top, party
                    down the back?
          Stu still looks confused. This is excruciating for Vick.VICK (CONT'D)Your hair, dude. You have a mullet.
          Stu touches his hair. Then he stumbles into the bathroom.
          After a beat, we hear his voice:STU (O.S.)Dude...I have a mullet.
          Then we hear ALAN'S VOICE in the bathroom, groggy:ALAN (O.S.)Just give me ten more minutes,
                    Beck...STU (O.S.)Whoa, did you sleep in the tub?
          Beat, then Stu pokes his head out of the bathroom.STU (CONT'D)Check it out: Alan slept in the
                    tub.VICKGet him up. I'm hungry.
          Stu disappears back into the bathroom. We hear the SHOWER
          turn on. Beat. Then we hear Alan slowly awaken:ALAN (O.S.)Wet. Water. Jesus, what's--?!
          There's a THUD as Alan falls out of tub. Beat.
          Then Stu and a very confused, very hungover, very wet Alan
          stumble out of the bathroom.
          Alan appears to be wearing his polo shirt from the night
          before. Only, as we PULL BACK, we see that his shirt is cut
          off at his chest -- he's naked from there down.VICKJesus, dude, put away your sack.
          Alan looks down at his hairy nakedness, totally bewildered.16.STUYeah, and it might be time for some
                    manscaping, bro. Your bush looks
                    like Yanni.
          Alan looks back up again, squinting, hungover.ALANWhat did we do last night?CUT TO:INT. HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATERThe guys, now dressed, stagger out of their suite moments
          later. Stu walks incredibly bow-legged, like an aging cowboy.STUDude, why is my ass killing me...?INT. ELEVATOR -- MOMENTS LATERLooking like crap, the guys silently descend in the elevator.
          BING! The elevator opens to expose a NICE-LOOKING COUPLE
          waiting to get on. They see the guys and immediately step
          away from the elevator.MANWe'll...we'll get the next one.
          The doors close. The guys continue to descend. Beat.VICKWe might not smell very good.
          The guys shake their heads, yeah, no.DISSOLVE TO:INT. MANDALAY BAY -- BREAKFAST BUFFET -- DAYThe guys slouch in a booth, shoveling masses of buffet food
          into their mouths, washing it down with huge mugs of coffee.STUThis might be the worst hangover
                    anyone has ever had, ever.ALANI can't taste anything.17.VICKPlease stop talking. If I don't
                    focus on eating I'm going to throw
                    up all over myself.
          The guys nod, right. They keep eating. After a long while:ALANHey... Are we missing something?
          The guys all slowly look around. Then Stu points at Alan:STUYes: I left my hat in the room --
                    thank you, Alan.
          They continue eating. Alan looks up again, still troubled.ALANNo. That's not it... There's
                    something else...
          Vick nods at Stu as he stuffs food in his mouth.VICKYou gonna finish that cruller?
          Stu shakes his head, no. Vick takes it, packs it into his
          already stuffed mouth. Then Alan realizes:ALANDoug. Guys, where's Doug?
          The guys look around. Hunh.STUYeah. He's not here.VICKProbably left him in the room.
          Vick pulls out his cell phone, starts dialing.VICK (CONT'D)I'll call his cell.
          Then a phone RINGS in Stu's pocket. He answers:STUGood morning, this is Stu?VICKIt's me, meatdick.18.STU(to Alan, concerned)
                    It's Vick--
          Then Stu realizes. Oh.STU (CONT'D)This is Doug's phone.
          Vick nods, ya. He's already dialing another number.ALANYou calling the room?
          Vick nods, uh-huh. He lets it ring, rubbing his temples. Then
          he hangs up.VICKNo answer.
          Vick goes back to eating. Alan frowns.ALANUmmm...shouldn't we look for him?
                    Check-out is in like ten minutes.STUYeah, and we told Tracy we'd have
                    Doug back to LA by five.
          Vick just looks at both of them, his mouth full of food:VICKI'm eabing.ALANWhat an asshole. Stu, check the
                    pool and the casino, I'll check the
                    room and the gym. Maybe he's
                    working out or something...
          Stu nods, and they slowly slide out of the booth.ALAN (CONT'D)And Vick, if you could keep a close
                    eye on the buffet, that'd be really
                    helpful. Thanks, man.
          Alan and Stu saunter off. Vick yells after them, mouth full:VICKHE'S FIME! YOU'RE OBERWEACTING!19.Vick scowls, and angrily takes Alan's last cruller.CUT TO:INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- MOMENTS LATERAlan weaves through the totalled suite, half-awake.ALANDoug...? Doug...? Wake up, man.
          Alan enters the bedroom where Doug slept, and stops. It takes
          him a second to realize what's wrong:THE BED IS MISSINGThere are four indentations on the carpet where it once lay.
          Alan scratches his head.ALANThat's weird...CUT TO:EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- POOL -- DAYStu, walking bow-legged, squinting painfully in the bright
          sun, tries to inspect everyone lying around the huge pool.
          Doug? Doug? Several HOT WOMEN in bikinis sit up, disgusted!STUNo, no. It's cool, I'm a dad. It's
                    totally cool...CUT TO:INT. GYM -- DAYAlan stumbles through the gym, looking for Doug. The place is
          packed with fit people, working out. Alan mumbles to himself:ALANI hate you all...CUT TO:INT. CASINO FLOOR -- NICKEL SLOTSStu wanders through the casino, calling out, incredibly loud:STUDOUG! DOUG!Two GAY MEN in identical tank tops pass by, holding hands.20.GAY MANHey Stu.STUHey guys. DOUG! DOUG--!
          Then Stu registers what just happened. He stops and turns
          around -- enh? -- but the gay men are gone.
          Before he can comment, however, he sees Vick and Alan
          talking to Atashir atTHE RECEPTION DESKHe slowly bow-legs himself over.STUYou find Doug?ALANNo, I assume you didn't either?
          Stu shakes his head, no. Then Atashir hangs up his phone.ATASHIRThere is no Doug Billings at any of
                    the area hospitals, morgues, or
                    police stations.
          The guys frown, starting to grow worried.STUMaybe he went for a jog?ALANDude. It's 120 degrees outside.STUOr shopping?
          The guys just look at him like: you're an idiot.ALANGreat. So we've officially lost
                    Doug. His wedding is in what, 22
                    hours?VICKRelax, it's Doug, he's probably
                    crashed out on someone's couch
                    right now. All we have to do is
                    retrace our steps from last night,
                    and we'll find him.21.ALANOkay, so last night...
          The guys wince, trying to remember. It's painful to think.VICKWell, we started on the roof...ALANRight, that was like, 6ish...?VICKThen...I think...we had steaks at
                    the Palm?ALANYeah. Then...we played craps at the
                    Hard Rock...maybe?VICKThat sounds right...
          Stu throws up his arms, already giving up.STUOkay, honestly? I don't even
                    remember going to dinner.VICKI vaguely recall...doing body shots
                    ....at some point? Is that...maybe?ALANI'm pretty much blank after The
                    Hard Rock.VICKI think we went to the Flamingo
                    after that...? And then, I just
                    remember a lot of blue light...and
                    the overpowering smell of baby oil.ALANSo that was what, 10ish?VICKGive or take.STUWas Doug still with us?
          Vick rubs his temples, trying to fight through the hangover.22.VICKYes. Yes. Doug was with us. I
                    tackled him...for some reason.
          The guys nod, okay, okay.ALANOkay. So we only have a 13 hour
                    window where we could've lost him.
          They guys frown. Shit. Stu puts his hands into his pockets,
          thinking... Then he feels something. A matchbook.
          He pulls it out. It's from The Flamingo Nightclub.STUHey! Look, we were at the Flamingo.
          A long beat of silence...
          Then the guys hurry to an empty BLACKJACK TABLE and start
          emptying their pockets of the detritus from the night before.
          They find matchbooks, receipts, room keys, a valet ticket...ALANATM receipt from the Rio at 10:37--
                        (reading it)
                    For 600 dollars?!VICKThe valet ticket says we returned
                    here at 4:57AM.STUWe drove last night?
          The guys wince, jesus...ALANHere's a receipt from Sbarro. The
                    meal was comped for some reason--VICKWhy do we have a matchbook from The
                    Golden Pony All Male Revue?
          The guys exchange a look, alarmed.ALANSomeone could've given that to us.23.STU(laughing, nervous)
                    Yeah, totally! There's no way we
                    went there! We're not gay! Hahaha!
          They frown, then stare at all the clues lined up on the
          blackjack table.ALANI think we should call Tracy.VICKAbsolutely not.ALANWhat if Doug called her? She might
                    know where he is.
          Stu shifts uncomfortably, tenderly adjusting his ass.STUYeah, I'm with Alan on this one.VICKOf course you're with Alan, you're
                    both gutless cowards. But we're not
                    calling Tracy. You never call the
                    bride from the bachelor party.
                    Ever. If my balls were on fire and
                    Tracy was sitting next door with a
                    tall glass of water, I still
                    wouldn't call her. It's a rule.ALANBut shouldn't we at least tell her
                    we're gonna be getting home late?VICKShe has a watch, she'll figure it
                    out.ALANI think I'm beginning to see why
                    you're always single.VICKAnd I think I'm beginning to see
                    why you're always a douche--STU(clutching his ass)
                    Guys, wait. I need your help -- oh
                    my God -- like right now. Come on.24.ALANJesus, what is it?CUT TO:INT. BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATERVick and Alan unhappily stand in the lavish, gold-ensconsed
          men's room, watching Stu painfully undo his jeans.VICKI can't believe we're doing this.STUYou don't have to look up my butt,
                    just at it. Something is terribly,
                    terribly wrong...
          Stu's jeans fall to the ground -- and everyone freezes.He's wearing a snug FLUORESCENT PINK G-STRING with "I
          ROGER" written vertically down the front. In glitter.ALANSweet mother of mercy...VICKWho's Roger?STUI-I-I don't know?! What do you
                    think it means?!VICKWhat do I think it means? Well,
                    Stuart, your ass is all torn up and
                    you're wearing thong underwear
                    declaring your love for another
                    dude -- I don't think we need the
                    CSI team for this one! You got
                    reamed last night, man!
          Stu covers his mouth, horrified!ALANI'm sure there's a perfectly
                    logical explanation for this...STUReally?! What?!
          Alan tries to think of one.25.ALANYeah, maybe there isn't.VICKLook, I'm sure Roger is a very
                    nice, considerate young man--STUOh my God, guys: what if I'm gay?!VICKCome on, Stu, you're nowhere near
                    cool enough.STU(gasping, realizing)
                    I do watch Dancing With The Stars
                    with the kids!ALANOh god, that doesn't mean you're
                    gay.VICKBut sort of...it does?
          Stu grows increasingly frantic.STUAnd once, I caught myself gazing at
                    a topless photo of David Beckham!ALANSo what, he's a great-looking dude--STUAnd then I had those weird feelings
                    for Vick that time in middle
                    school, remember?!
          Everyone stops. Vick most of all.VICKUm, what?STUYeah, that weekend we were all
                    camping -- I told you this.VICKYeah, no you didn't.STUI didn't?26.VICKI think I'd remember, dude.ALANYeah, I think we'd all remember.STUYeah. I had weird feelings for you
                    that weekend. Like really hot,
                    really gay feelings. But then they
                    went away.
          Vick is just looking at him, stunned.ALANWait -- I was there that weekend.
                    Did you have gay feelings for me?VICKUnbelievable.ALANWhat?! I was a good-looking kid!VICKPlease, you're so not his type!STUWait, what?
          Just then, a FATHER and his YOUNG SON enter the men's room
          and see Stu standing there, pants down, in his G string...VICKLook, Stu, one homosexual
                    experience doesn't mean you're
                    permanently gay, okay? A lot of
                    guys test the waters.
          ...the FATHER and SON wheel right back around and exit.ALANAll right, we're scaring the
                    children. Let's go.
          The guys head for the door. Stu quickly pulls up his pants.STUWait -- so have either of you
                    tested the waters?VICKNo! We're not gay!27.Stu looks highly confused as he follows them out ontoTHE CASINO FLOORThe guys power through the crowded casino, towards the exit.
          Stu tries to keep up, genuinely concerned.STUHow am I going to tell my wife?VICKQuickly, and from a great distance.
          Alan's hand accidentally hits a brass railing and CLINKS...STUJesus, what kind of father am I?
          Alan's hand CLINKS against the railing again, and this time
          it registers. Alan looks down -- and stops cold.ALANOh my God.STU(really scared)
                    You think Erin will try to take the
                    kids--?ALANOh...my...God.VICK(turning, annoyed)
                    What now?
          Alan holds up the source of his CLINKING: on his ring finger
          is a huge, tacky, silver WEDDING RING with a unicorn on it.STU(not getting it)
                    Cool ring. Also, my Dad is gonna
                    have a field day with this.
          Vick, however, recognizes the implications of the ring, and
          starts back towards Alan.VICKOh my God... Oh my God...STUWhat's the big--?
                        (finally realizing)
                    Oh! OH! OH!28.Alan steadies himself against a SLOT MACHINE, and shakily
          takes off the massive unicorn ring.STU (CONT'D)Maybe it's not a wedding ring?ALAN(reading inscription)
                    "To My Noble Husband, Alan."
          The guys eyes bulge, oh shit!STUThis is worse than my underwear!
          Vick takes the ring and reads the rest of the inscription:VICK"Now & Forever Wedding Chapel."
          They guys exchange a look.VICK (CONT'D)Well, at least it's a lead.
          Beat. Then Alan turns and THROWS UP all over the slot
          machine. Nearby OCTOGENARIAN SLOT PLAYERS look over,
          disgusted -- but continue playing their nickels.CUT TO:EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- VALET STAND -- DAYThe three guys exit the hotel looking like crap. Vick hands

                    before sundown. Easy as Stu's ass.
          No one laughs. Tense SILENCE as they wait for the car.STUCheck it out, some idiot threw his
                    bed out the window last night.
          Stu points over at a huge stone GRIFFIN in front of the hotel
          with an ENTIRE BED impaled upon its ear.ALANThat was us, dude.29.STUReally?ALANYeah, there's no bed in Doug's
                    room.STU(FROWNING)Oh. Well, I'm sure we had a good

          Just then the Valet drives up inVICK'S DESTROYED CADILLACThe exterior is scratched and filthy, like it's been off-
          roading. The hubcaps are gone, as is the front passenger side
          door. A wisp of STEAM trails up from under the hood.
          The guys just stand there, agape.STUYou okay, Vick?VICKI'm not emotionally prepared to
                    talk about it just yet, Stuart, but

          plastic chairs. The guys enter.ALANWhat if they don't remember us--?VOICE BEHIND THEMAAAAYYYYY!The guys turn to find the hirsute owner of the chapel, STEVE
          GIANOPOLUS, 40's, in a tight white suit, his arms spread
          wide. Steve is all Vegas, by way of Long Island.STEVEHow are you, you dumb bastards?!31.He warmly hugs the guys. They have zero memory of him, and it
          shows as they hug back weakly, unfamiliar...STEVE (CONT'D)CARLA, GET YOUR FAT ASS OUT HERE!ALAN AND THE BOYS ARE HERE!(to the guys)
                    You here to pick up your wedding
                    photos?!
          Alan starts to decline, when--VICKDoes the pope wear a funny hat?!
                    Let's do this thing!
          Steve CACKLES and guides them over to a table; Alan scowls.STEVEAnd where is Chastity today?
          They all sit on white plastic chairs.ALANW-Who's...Chastity?STEVE(LAUGHING)Your wife, man--! AWW, you're just
                    breaking my balls!
          Alan looks ill. Laughing, Steve retrieves a folder and starts
          laying out a series of WEDDING PHOTOS on the table. Vick
          eagerly peruses them, enjoying this.VICKUh, it was such a lovely ceremony,
                    wasn't it?STEVEHand to God, I've never seen two
                    people more in love!VICKSadly, I believe you...
          The guys look at the photos of Alan's wedding from the night
          before. They're typical wedding shots, only the guys are all
          wearing MEDIEVAL COSTUMES, swords, bows, tights, even armor.
          They look incredibly happy -- and incredibly drunk.
          The next photo is of Alan and his BUSTY BLONDE BRIDE. She's
          having a blast in a white medieval gown and tiara.32.VICK (CONT'D)Hello, Chastity...
          Alan just closes his eyes, oh God.ALANI am never...ever...drinking again.STUJesus, she is stacked.VICKStu, please, show some class.
                    That's Alan's wife you're talking
                    about.STU(to Alan, guilty)
                    Sorry. She looks really nice.
          But Alan is too busy gaping at the next photo, of him and
          Chastity atop a UNICORN in the chapel. (It is, of course, a
          rented pony with a lame horn strapped to its head.)ALANWe got a unicorn?!STEVEOh, yeah, you got the entire Double
                    Camelot Package.
          Alan just rubs his temples, oh no.ALANA-And how much did that cost?STEVE7 thousand dollars.
          Alan closes his eyes. Stu and Vick exchange a look, no way!STEVE (CONT'D)Yeah, you didn't want to get it,
                    either, but Vick insisted.
          Beat. Then Alan pounces across the table at Vick!ALANI'm gonna kill you!VICK(fending him off)
                    You can't put a pricetag on love,
                    Alan! OW! You just can't!33.Stu hops up and starts pulling Alan off of Vick.VOICE BEHIND THEMSTOP FIGHTING IMMEDIATELY!The guys straighten like schoolboys as Steve's wife CARLA,
          40's, enters. She's wearing a toga, smoking a menthol, and
          dollying in several large CARDBOARD BOXES. Then she grins:CARLAAhhh! I'm just busting your nuts!
          She lowers the dolly and hurries over for hugs.CARLA (CONT'D)Good to see you, you stupid mooks!
          Stu and Alan force smiles, no idea who this woman is. Vick,
          on the other hand, steps forward and hugs her tightly.VICKIt's good to be seen, Carla. It's
                    good to be seen.CARLAI brought the rest of your package.
          Carla begins unloading things from the cardboard boxes.CARLA (CONT'D)First: Two dozen commuter mugs...
          She unpacks 24 COMMUTER MUGS with Alan and Chastity's photo
          emblazoned on them. Alan winces, oh god. Stu grabs one:STUNo way! Awesome!STEVEA hundred DVDs of the ceremony...
          She lays out the stacks of DVDs. Vick nods at Alan:VICKFor you and Chastity to watch on
                    your anniversary...
          Alan just clenches his jaw, I fucking hate you.CARLAThe velvet wall hanging...
          She pulls out a six foot air-brushed velvet WALL HANGING of
          Alan and Chastity riding the unicorn together in outer space.34.VICKAnd it looks like real velvet,
                    Alan, so no machine wash, okay?CARLAAnd the big finish:
          Vick and Stu do a DRUMROLL on the table, excited...
          Then Carla pulls out a FOUR FOOT BRONZE SHIELD with a bas-
          relief of Alan and Chastity MAKING OUT on it. Alan just
          closes his eyes.STUHOLY CRAP!VICKDUDE, YOU HAVE A SHIELD!STUI want a shield!VICKMe too! Hey, can Stu and I get a
                    shield?ALANI don't suppose you have any sort
                    of return policy, do you?STEVEUm...if you know another couple who
                    looks exactly like you guys, and
                    who want two dozen commuter mugs, a
                    wall hanging, and a shield...sure.
          Alan scowls. Then his cellphone RINGS. He angrily answers it
          without looking at the Caller ID.ALANWhat.
          We hear someone YELLING AT HIM. Alan's eyes bulge.ALAN (CONT'D)Oh, hey Becky! Hi!
          He steps away to take the call. Vick explains to Carla:VICKThat's his girlfriend of 14 years.
                    I'm sure this'll only take a

                    where we went after the wedding?46.CHASTITYNo, but I bet some of my work
                      friends do. You were partying with

          Club, The Crazy Horse. It's bacchanalia writ large, complete
          with throbbing music, flashing strobe lights, and six stages
          of spinning flesh. The place is mobbed with PATRONS.
          Alan follows after Chastity, horrified.ALANYou work here?
          Behind him, Vick SLAPS FIVE with Stu, psyched.CHASTITYYeah -- and this is the pole where
                      we first met!
          She stops at a pole, around which a BRUNETTE STRIPPER
          currently spins. Alan looks ill.CHASTITY (CONT'D)It's always been my lucky pole...ALANLook, I don't know how to tell you
                      this, but--CHASTITYHEY PLATINUM, CHECK IT OUT!She holds up her hand, showing off ALAN'S GRANDMOTHER'S RING
          to the stripper currently upside-down on the pole.PLATINUM THE STRIPPERGet it, girl!CHASTITYCome on, let's go meet my

          Alan just stares into space. Vick takes him by the shoulder.VICKLook, we can get your grandmother's

                    it in the right way.ALANI have besmirched my people.STUDon't be so hard on yourself, dude--
          Just then Chastity runs back over with two BLONDE STRIPPERS.CHASTITYThese were my bridesmaids,

                    but my friends and I were very

                    Dude: I might not be gay.

                    gotta find Doug!VICKWhat do you think we're doing?ALANWhat?VICKWe're getting into the mindset of

                    Moshe Mervish into it, but it had
                    to be said. Now yes, we have 18
                    hours to find Doug -- which means
                    we can afford to spend ten minutes
                    celebrating the special talents of
                    these gifted young body-artists. So
                    sit down, have a jager shot, and

                    honey? When you're ready?
          Chastity pushes Alan onto the red leather banquette and
          starts dancing for him. He tries to squirm away:ALANNo, look-- I am like totally
                    against this, morally and
                    politically. Plus Becky

          onto his lap, she whips him with her long hair, she puts her
          tongue in his ear. Next to him, no longer getting lapdances,
          Vick and Stu just sit, staring at Chastity, entranced.STUI think I know why he married her.VICKBecause if he hadn't, I would've.
          They continue watching on in silence.STUIs it weird that we're sitting this
                    close watching?VICKNot for me.
          More watching in silence.51.STUI really shouldn't be here. I have
                    daughters.
          Then both of their heads angle the same way.VICKNot that can do that.STUHow can she do that without
                    dislocating her hip?VICKBecause she's been touched by God.
          They continue staring, amazed. Just then, the door is kicked
          open and KIKIOLANI and KALOLO FANALUA burst into the
          Champagne Room, peering through the darkness, looking for our
          guys. Vick and Stu see them immediately.VICK (CONT'D)Shit.
          They both hop up. Alan remains sitting, however, hypnotized
          by Chastity. Vick grabs him.VICK (CONT'D)Alan, come on, man, we gotta go!ALANWhoa, whoa, I'm smelling the roses--
          Vick literally yanks Alan up from the banquette.VICKCome on, man! We got company!
          Finally, the Guamians spot the guys and lumber for them!VICK (CONT'D)Chastity, honey, is there a back
                    way out of here?!
          Thinking fast, Chastity grabs her clothes and darts over to

          hallways of the Crazy Horse, weaving through strippers,
          cocktail waitresses, and barbacks.
          Behind them, the two massive Samoans try to follow, but are
          slowed by all the foot traffic. Strippers SCREAM as they're
          bowled over by the obese Islanders.INT. CRAZY HORSE -- MAIN STAGEA spotlight holds on a CLOSED CURTAIN covering the main

          The patrons start to BOOO, just as Vick, Chastity, and Alan
          blow through the curtain after Stu.CHASTITYCome on!
          Chastity, in six inch leucite heels, sprints down the main
          runway, leaps over the patrons sitting at the end, and hits
          the floor running!STUDid she just do that in heels?!VICKI'm really starting to like this
                    girl.
          The guys all follow suit, sprinting down the runway and
          leaping over the patrons!
          Then the Guamians blow through the curtain, panting, very
          upset. They lumber down the stage -- and the patrons at the
          end of the runway clear the hell out of the way.CHASTITY AND THE GUYS RACE THROUGH THE STRIP CLUBUpsetting cocktails, hopping onto stages and then off again,
          leaping over chairs, spinning around stripper poles, and,

          Alan and Stu sit behind the cold metal table.
          Vick looks tense, but in control. Stu and Alan are sweating,
          terrified. They've clearly been here a while.OFFICER MERRIWEATHERWhere were you last night at 3am?VICKNo idea.OFFICER BLADENOkay, how about at 2am?VICKDitto.
          Officer Bladen SLAMS the table with his fist.OFFICER MERRIWEATHERYou think this is cute, son?! You

                    either charge us with a crime, or
                    let us go.
          Merriweather scowls and nods at Bladen, who steps over to a
          TELEVISION and turns it on. Merriweather, meanwhile, pulls
          out a photograph of a slick ASIAN MAN in a red suit, slides
          it onto the table.OFFICER MERRIWEATHERWhat do you know about Jimmy Lang?
          Vick flinches ever-so-slightly, clearly knowing something.
          Stu and Alan just look at the photograph, confused.55.ALANNothing?STUWho is he?OFFICER MERRIWEATHERJimmy Lang runs the infamous Shiang-

          ON THE TELEVISION, grainy surveillance camera footage of a
          birthday party starts playing. In the video, JIMMY LANG sits
          in an upscale restaurant, in front of a BIRTHDAY CAKE, as a
          table full of hip ASIAN GUYS serenade him with "Happy
          Birthday To You."
          When the guys sitting next to Jimmy lean forward to help him
          blow out the candles on his cake, however, we see that it's
          Vick, ALAN, STU, DOUG, and some BLACK GUY, all very drunk!VICK & ALAN & STU & DOUG (ON TAPE)HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR JIMMMMY, HAPPYBIRTHDAY TOOO YOOOOU!Everyone applauds. Vick drunkenly hugs Jimmy Lang.VICK (ON TAPE)I love you, Jimmy Lang!

                    girls, but it never got off the
                    ground. It was an entirely
                    legitimate enterprise -- I had no
                    idea he was a criminal. We must've
                    bumped into him last night, and he
                    must've invited us to join his

          They roll on the ground, trying to punch each other, but it

          Alan and Vick continue rolling on the lawn, trying to beat
          the crap out of each other. They could be kids again. Then,

          in front of his mirror. ON THE TV a very Brokeback,
          Chippendale's-style male revue starts playing. Stu GASPS.

          and assless chaps, grinding on stage with the Golden Pony

          ON THE TV Stu gets on all fours on the stage, and eagerly
          gestures for the dancers to take turns "riding" him.

          shoulder, and sees him crying. She rolls her eyes.ERINJesus, are you still drunk?

                    this, Vick.
