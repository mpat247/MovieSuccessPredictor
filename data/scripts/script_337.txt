          under his watch that Armstrong /

          Randomization of Housing Act.
          Second years of color no longer
          have a say in where they go. The

          wiped out in two years.

Troy looks to see if the speech is working. As Sam warms up --SAM (CONT'D)This wasn't motivated by a desire
          to mix things up. Bring about
          racial and socioeconomic harmony.
          No, the Black kids are sitting

delivers the next one directly at Sofia and Troy.SAM (CONT'D)This Act doesn't affect the other

               Ya'll ain't ready and I didn't come
               here for that. The Black Student
               Union and I have brought a petition
               to repeal the Randomization of
               Housing Act. I plan on bringing it
               to the President and together we
               can bring Black back to Manchester.
               It'll be by the door.

     slips a card to a still stunned Sam. Coco watches him go.17   INT.

     He contemplates her. Fights a growing smile.18   INT. DEAN'S OFFICE - DAY                                    18A fireplace rages behind Lionel who stares at the floor while

of all races on the steps of Ellington Library including Troy
with the phrase "MANCHESTER: WHERE YOU BELONG" printed below.
Troy's huge smile seems to mock him.DEAN FAIRBANKSYou like jazz Lionel? Manchester's

     amongst them - his hair a finger waved Ceasar fade, as he
     trades "No Homo's" with the others.

     Lionel shakes it off. Peers over to a group of out and proud
     gay kids and sees a version of himself amongst them - his
     hair straightened and coifed in a fitted shirt laughing.

               update. Love you too mom.

     applause. Troy and his table look around baffled.

     By the caution on Sam's face it seems the first time she's
     ever heard this sound directed at her.

      Sam walks off in a half jog - Fairbank's last words resonate
      more than she'd like.

      Gabe, making his way outside just catches her exit.59B   EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY                                   59BHuge canvas signs with the words "WHITES ONLY" are strewn

Sam is struck by the command. Stuck between wanting to curse

her phone. Sam checks: "IT'S ABOUT DAD. CALL ME"

Sam turns for some privacy. She makes eye contact with Gabe

      look of indignation asks her what she's doing.REGGIESam?

               a hell of a time.KURTWhat party --PRESIDENT FLETCHER-- You're cancelling Kurt. End of

     hears...GEORGE (O.S.)Lionel's story on the would-be
               protest outside of Gillespie is
               running tomorrow and I'm also
               having Lionel work on a profile
               piece of Armstrong/Parker like you
               suggested. Really break down what's
               going on.

     Lionel gingerly approaches the door to see George finish up a
     phone call.GEORGE (CONT'D)Right. It's almost like they
               recycle so much from their past -
               Music, food, fashion, and now
               turbulence.

     This leaves a bitter taste in Lionel's mouth.GEORGE (CONT'D)Thank you so much. Okay, take care.

     George can't fight his grin as he looks to Annie.ANNIEWell?GEORGEThat was our Times advisor. He said
               it's stories like these that get
               editors recommendation letters.

     Lionel knocks on the door. Annie and George are startled but
     reassured when they see who it is.78.LIONELThe Negro at the door didn't scare
          you this time.

Annie smiles and heads for the door.ANNIELionel please. You're only
          technically Black. G, going to
          French. You want me to hold your
          seat?GEORGEThanks.

Annie smiles and walks out.LIONELYou need something? Saw your e-

          Donor's function on Saturday. Small
          dinner for the school's big givers.

          coverage.LIONELThat's Halloween night.GEORGERight, which is why no one else
          will take it.LIONELAh. Thus the new guy.

George gathers his backpack and walks over to Lionel. Gets
close.GEORGEOn my way to class, but you can
          stay and check out last year's
          piece. You'll do fine.LIONELI don't know. Are there going to be
          any racially fueled outbursts at

               away from landing the Times.GEORGEGod I hope so.

     Lionel looks down. He is being used. Turns to go, just as --GEORGE (CONT'D)Hey.

     -- George grabs Lionel unsure what he wants to say. So
     instead he just kisses him.GEORGE (CONT'D)I'm glad we finally got that Bugle
               on your chest.

     Lionel's all mixed up.GEORGE (CONT'D)There's a big party the night of
               the Donor's event. Call me after,
               maybe we can hang?LIONELYeah. Sounds good.

     of a wild party. Lionel clears his throat and heads in.79   INT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                    79The party is dark and rambunctious. Lots of white kids in
     costume. Some as fairies or ninjas or Spiderman - but most as
     pimps and thugs. As Blaxploitation characters. As Barack
     Obama and Condi Rice. As Shaft, Ice Cube, and 2 Chainz.

     It's a lot for Lionel. Cups are handed to them filled with
     "Purple Drank." Everyone downs the stuff.INT. GILLESPIE HALL - NIGHTTroy is being appreciated by an ancient COUPLE.TROY...my own firm. Maybe run for

      put up flyers and posters. They seem caught off guard. Lionel
      glances at the posters - it's Kurt with a large Afro wig
      mimicking Sam's "Missing Black Culture" flyers.LIONELThis is kind of fucked up. Right?GEORGEPastiche. The world's most erudite

      feeling herself as she's handed a drink.

      She's got eyes on her - for the first time like this at a
      party. But she sees the same thing Lionel saw.

      Her confidence starts to fight a shame that creeps up beneath
      her party face. She switches her iPhone to video mode...COCOHey there muffins. How do I look?
                Why are white folks so obsessed
                with being Black? And why are Black
                folks so addicted to Blonde Barbie
                doll weaves? Honeys it's a strange
                symbiosis we're here to explore...

      Coco's voice cracks as she stares into her own image on her

     Pulls a touch too hard.GEORGE (CONT'D)I could eat you like a Hershey's.

     This sets something off in Lionel.LIONELI'll be right back.

     of caricatures and reveling students. Can't breathe.EXT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHTLionel squeezes his way outside. Something goes off in his
     head as he starts walking away from the party.

     Just then Kurt arrives in front of the house with some
     friends. Looks at Lionel then at the house.KURTWhat the hell?81   INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER - NIGHT                              81Lionel paces the halls. His mind churns as he passes the

     LIKE SERENA WILLIAMS starts up a MYSTIKAL record.

     The crowd starts to get live now.

     Coco continues to make her way through the party - her face
     visibly perturbed by the time she reaches the kitchen. She
     continues out back...83   EXT. KURT'S BACKYARD - NIGHT                                 83...and sits pulling out a cigarette. She sees Annie put on a

      Lionel gets up and walks towards the door.SAM (CONT'D)I'm done being everybody's angry
                Black chick.

      Sam looks down as Lionel gets up and heads out.

      Sam's focus shifts to her Super 8 resting by the door and
      then to a bullhorn directly across from it. Her mind ticks.86    INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - NIGHT                        86Lionel exits and paces down the hall. He walks by the dining

No one answers him - just stay to their own conversations.
Lionel spots a familiar face...Sungmi.LIONEL (CONT'D)Hey...what is this?SUNGMIBlack Student Union.

          out tonight. Looks like Sam's not
          making it so...let's just call it.

The crowd starts to talk amongst themselves, get up and
leave. Just then Lionel stands and before he can think...LIONELUh. Excuse me. Hi. I'm Lionel. Some
          of you...none of you probably know

          on campus and I think you should
          know about it.

Lionel's nerves can be heard in his voice now. He's got the
judging eyes of the room fixed silently on him. He sees an
open laptop on a desk.LIONEL (CONT'D)Anybody mind if I?

Reggie shifts a bit as Lionel goes to the laptop and pulls up
the party on Facebook. The crowd gathers around as Lionel
browses through the photos.LIONEL (CONT'D)I mean...I don't know. This is
          fucked up right?REGGIEAlright brother. What's the plan?89.Lionel realizes the eyes aren't judging. They're mobilizing.

      Lionel sinks from this attack while his posse from BSU
      watches helplessly as the party goes back into full swing.

      Lionel turns to go and spots...

      ...George who joins Annie, fresh beer in hand. But right
      behind George is...

      ...Sam, having just arrived with her camera in hand pointed
      at the rap battle. She winks at Lionel.

      Lionel turns around - summons something from deep inside.

      Lionel steps onto the DJ platform and snatches the mic out of
      one of the rapper's hands.LIONELHeyyyy! Hoooo! Heyyy! Hooo!92.The crowd is with it - thinks it's part of the show as Lionel
proceeds to freestyle terribly...LIONEL (CONT'D)My name is Lionel,
          Some people call me Li.
          Lots of people think
          that I talk kinda white.
          Well that's alright.
          Yeah that's cool.
          I'd rather you think I'm white,
          than tap dance for you.

With that Lionel takes the mic and SMASHES it on the wall. He
then takes the turntable by his hands and flips it over.

Sparks fly - the amp goes crazy - the crowd is in shock.

Lionel grabs a speaker tower and slams it to the ground.
Lionel's off the platform now. Kurt grabs him - Reggie pushes
Kurt away in his defense.

Gordon grabs Reggie - A FIGHT BREAKS OUT.

More equipment is slammed to the ground and stomped on as the
party disintegrates into chaos.

Sam dodges fights to capture it all with the camera.

Art is being ripped from the walls. Dishes being smashed on
the ground. Arguments come to physical blows.

The steel in Sam's gaze fades. Replaced by...heartbreak?

And then she spots...

...Coco squeezing her way through the crowd for the door.
Sam's camera and mic stay trained on Coco.COCOWhat? Say it. Come on.

Sam stays silent.COCO (CONT'D)This may come as a shock, but these
          people don't give a fuck about no

               party.

     Sam keeps her mouth shut and her camera rolling as Coco
     realizes it's herself she's trying to convince.

     Coco storms off. Sam exhales and lowers her camera. This is
     new for her. Keeping her mouth shut.89   EXT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                   89Coco trudges down the side walk - yanks off her hair, her

     ground.KURTDude. I know you can't help it...

     Lionel just gets back up again only to be slammed down.KURT (CONT'D)...but why are you such a fag dude?

     Lionel spits in Kurt's face and pops right back up again. We
     see it in his eyes - he'll never give up.

     Kurt's hand is on Lionel's collar. He pushes him down again.
     Kids are all around - some from the BSU - some from Pastiche -
     some from the Bugle. Everyone holds an opposite party back.

     Lionel looks over at his audience and then into Kurt's eyes.
     Lionel leans in and kisses Kurt on the mouth long and hard.LIONELFinally got me where you want me.

     Kurt's in shock. He looks at his crew who laugh at him.

     Lionel sees the surprise in the eyes of his new supporters as
     well. No time to soak this in though. Kurt's let up. For a
     moment. Lionel turns back to Kurt and PUNCHES him in the
     face. The BSU kids go CRAZY in support.

     The shock gone - Kurt damn near knocks Lionel out.

     The world goes all slow motion and out of focus. Lionel sort
     of makes out that Kurt is yanked off him.94.Kids run in different directions - Flashlights fill the yard -
      One is shone directly on Lionel. CAMPUS SAFETY GUARDS and a

      complete standstill.

      with Kurt who is being held by a Campus Safety Officer.

     triumphant, winning version of himself on his poster.106.Coco's eyes shift longingly as she walks ahead - unsure of
      who she is at the moment and who she will be in the next.

      Watching her is Lionel and Sam - sitting with Gabe and
      Sungmi. They both know that look well...SAMHey Lionel. With me out and Troy
