                                   Seth Lochead1 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - DAY. 1Winter. Silence on the forest floor. Snow falling. Then the
          sound of breathing. The soft footfall of a person running.
          HANNA, fourteen years old, long hair, eyes like blue ice,
          glides through the trees, a bow strapped to her shoulder. She
          is dressed in animal skins and fur shoes. She blends almost
          completely into the landscape of trees and snow.
          She stops dead. Her breath visible in the freezing air.
          Suddenly alert, she has spotted her prey. A REINDEER nuzzling
          the snow, trying to unearth a patch of grass to eat. Its head
          pops up - danger. Too late. The sudden swoosh and the snap of
          an arrow piercing its skin.
          The deer flops to the ground with a thud. It whines, its feet
          dig at the earth. Its mouth gnaws at the icy air. Steam
          pouring from its nostrils.
          HANNA approaches, removes a fur glove. She bends to her
          knees.
          She reaches out and gently pets the animals frightened face.
          She runs her hand down along its neck, in towards the wound.HANNAI just missed your heart.
          She stands and pulls out an old pistol from her waist
          holster.
          She fires two shots directly at CAMERA.CUT TO TITLE: HANNA2 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - LATER. 2A knife enters the deer near its anus.HANNA(WHISPER)Remove the penis and scrotum, make
          a deep, circular cut around the
          rectum.
          HANNA pulls the knife up towards the brisket.HANNA (CONT'D)(WHISPER)Cut from the rear to the brisket.
          She works calmly without expression.2.3 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - LATER 3The deer lies on it's side.
          HANNA breaths hard. She reaches deep into the body cavity
          and pulls out intestine, stomach, liver.
          She freezes, sensing danger.
          Her hand deep inside the animal. She listens. She looks out
          into the still forest. No sound.
          ERIK, mid forties, a mammoth with leathery face, stands
          behind her like a ghost.ERIKYou're dead. Right now. I've
          killed you.
          HANNA spins spraying deer-blood on to the snow and brings
          her fist right to ERIK's face. He blocks and thumps an open
          palm on to HANNA's shoulder sending her sprawling into the
          snow.
          She leaps to her feet, as ERIK aims a kick at her head. She
          dodges, punches below his knee cap, and goes for her
          pistol. ERIK slaps the hand away.ERIK (CONT'D)Use your hands!
          She goes for the gun again and again he stops her.
          He moves in tight, pulling the gun from its holster and
          tossing it deep into the forest.
          HANNA clips ERIK'S temple sending him to the ground.
          She wraps her arms around his neck preparing to snap...
          ... but she can't.
          He throws her over his shoulder into a pile of snow.
          ERIK stands and wipes the snow from his pants. His face shows
          a touch of frustration.
          He plods into the forest.ERIK (CONT'D)Drag it back yourself.
          HANNA drags herself to the deer's side. She stares at its
          dead face.3.4 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - LATER 4HANNA clears the kill site. Wipes the last dots of blood on
          to a stick. No sign she was ever there.5 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - EVENING 5HANNA drags the 200 lb deer on a makeshift sled. She lifts
          her knees high and moves at a steady pace.
          Hidden among the trees, a little way off, ERIK is watching
          her.6 EXT. LOG CABIN. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - EVENING 6A log cabin built around an ancient tree surrounded by the
          thick forest. HANNA is standing in the snow, stripping the
          deer with a knife. It's a tough job but she does it no fuss.7 INT. LOG CABIN - EVENING 7Almost everything ERIK and HANNA own they've made themselves
          using what can be found in the forest. What few possessions
          that have been brought in from the outside world are old and
          worn.
          HANNA is making a fire using a bow drill. The friction of the
          drill produces an ember which HANNA carefully transfers to
          some dried leaves.8 INT. LOG CABIN - LATER 8HANNA and ERIK sit either side of a small fire, still dressed
          in furs.
          HANNA swirls a spoon around in a dish of stew. ERIK takes a
          mouthful, watches HANNA not eating.ERIKWhat's wrong? Are you hurt?
          She keeps swirling her spoon.ERIK (CONT'D)You were half asleep.HANNAI'll do better next time.ERIKGerman.4.HANNA(In German w/ EnglishSUBTITLES)I'll do better next time.ERIKItalian.HANNA(In Italian w/ EnglishSUBTITLES)I'll do better next time.ERIKSpanish.
          HANNA studies her food and slowly takes a spoonful.ERIK (CONT'D)(INSISTENT)Spanish.HANNA(In Spanish w/ EnglishSUBTITLES)Did you really want me to snap your
          neck?
          He looks at her - drops the quiz.ERIKHow much did you pull off the deer?HANNAA hundred and twenty with scraps.ERIKAbout 200 pounds in total?
          HANNA nods.ERIK (CONT'D)That explains it.HANNAWhat?ERIKHow you beat me. You're getting
          strong.
          HANNA almost blushes.
          ERIK stands to put his bowl away.ERIK (CONT'D)(In Spanish w/ EnglishSUBTITLES)(MORE)5.ERIK (CONT'D)I'm glad you didn't snap my neck.9 INT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - NIGHT 9HANNA is in bed under fur covers listening while ERIK reads
          to her from an old encyclopedia.ERIKThe Great Blue Whale is the largest
          animal to have ever existed. A blue
          whale's tongue weighs over two and
          a half tons and its mouth is large
          enough to hold 90 tons of food and
          water.HANNAHow much is that?ERIKIt's bigger than the cabin. Its
          heart weighs thirteen
          hundred pounds and a male has seven
          gallons of testicles.
          HANNA smirks.ERIK (CONT'D)The Blue Whale's "music" can be
          heard for over 500 miles.
          He shuts the book.ERIK (CONT'D)Time for sleep.HANNAGood night.
          He stands by her bed looking down at her.ERIKDid you forget something?HANNANo.
          ERIK takes HANNA'S gun out of his pocket and puts it on the
          table next to her bed.HANNA (CONT'D)Sorry.ERIKGood night.
          He walks to the door. HANNA stops him with a question.6.HANNAWhat's music like?ERIKIt's difficult to explain.HANNATry.
          He opens the encyclopedia again, leafs through the pages and
          reads.ERIK(READING)‘Music. A combination of sounds
          with a view to beauty of form and
          expression of emotion'.HANNABut how does it feel?
          Erik is not equipped to answer such esoteric questions.ERIKGood. It feels good. It's, uh,
          nice.HANNATell me properly. Can you play
          music?ERIKYour mother could. She used to sing
          very well.HANNAI'd like to hear it for myself.ERIKYou will soon enough.HANNAHow soon?
          Erik looks away from her questioning eyes.ERIKWhen you're ready.HANNAI'm ready. I'm ready already.
          They look at each other- he weighs it up.ERIKJust go to sleep now. I'll see you
          in the morning.7.Hanna covers herself in an animal skin as ERIK pulls a wattle
          screen across her bed, strokes her hair gently for a moment
          and leaves the room.
          HANNA reaches under her bed and takes out an old battered
          photograph, taken 15 years ago, of a YOUNG WOMAN with eyes
          like hers - her MOTHER, JOANNA ZADEK.10 EXT. LOG CABIN - MORNING 10The morning sunlight slants through the forest.
          ERIK is walking through the trees. He stops, raises his
          pistol at a tree trunk some distance away and fires.
          The tree breaks apart.11 INT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - MORNING 11HANNA wakes with the sound of the GUNSHOT. She is still
          holding her mothers photgraph.
          HANNA pushes the photograph under her mattress and climbs out
          of bed.12 EXT. LOG CABIN. SHOOTING RANGE - MORNING 12Another GUNSHOT breaks a tree apart.
          Hanna fires. Another tree breaks apart. She rolls and
          fires.
          She rolls and fires. She reloads. And fires.
          ERIK watching.13 EXT. LOG CABIN - DAY 13HANNA attacks ERIK. Hand. Knee. Elbow. Fist. He defends
          easily.ERIKAgain.
          They reset. She repeats the motion. Hand. Knee. Elbow. Fist.ERIK (CONT'D)Again.
          Hand. Knee. Elbow. Fist. She's getting faster. Her strikes
          are solid.8.14 EXT. LOG CABIN - DAY 14A medium size log nailed along two pillars of the cabin
          acts as a chin-up bar.
          Erik and Hanna do chin-ups. Both are fit. Neither will give
          up. ERIK observing HANNA's power. Both have the sense that
          he is judging her. HANNA's face fiercely determined.15 EXT. LOG CABIN - DAY 15ERIK and HANNA sit with their backs to a tree in the huge
          forest as they breathlessly recover from the exhaustion of
          the exercise. HANNA speaks fast, reciting.HANNAI live in Leipzig. German city.
          Population 0.7 Million people. We
          live at Number 7 Weissingerplatz. I
          go to school at the Klaus Kohle
          Gymnasium and my best friends are
          Rudi Gunter and Clara Schliess. I
          like literature and sport, in
          particular tennis and athletics. I
          have a dog called Trudi.16 EXT. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - DAY 16HANNA is running, racing ERIK. Fierce determination, almost
          anger in her eyes. They reach the river and dive in.17 EXT. RIVER - DAY. 17HANNA and ERIK are swimming hard against the current of the
          fast-flowing river, working at full pelt just to stay still.
          They swim and swim, their muscles busting, their lungs
          bursting.ERIKDon't give up! Don't give up!
          HANNA's arms flails as she fights against the stream and she
          screams in pain. She is grabbed under by the undertow and is
          pulled downwards. For a second she is underwater and in
          darkness but ERIK's hand pulls her back up and she breaks the
          surface with a gasp of relief.18 EXT. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST. RIVER BANK. 18On the bank, HANNA climbs out. ERIK approaches her but
          moodily, even angrily, she pushes him away.HANNAI didn't need your help.9.Her face sullen, she walks away into the forest. He stares
          after her.19 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT 19Outside, ERIK stands alone, thinking. An OWL swoops down to
          catch a mouse then flies back up into the tree tops.20 INT. CABIN. HANNA'S ROOM - NIGHT. 20HANNA is asleep.
          ERIK enters the room.
          ERIK approaches the bed, and solemnly takes out a pistol and
          aims it at HANNA. He is tense with expectation.
          Suddenly HANNA bursts from her covers, smashes the pistol
          from ERIK's hand and smashes him down on to the bed. She
          grabs the pistol and points it at his face. She is alert,
          eyes intense, face proud. She speaks quietly.HANNAI'm ready now.ERIKMaybe.
          ERIK relaxes. It's a false beat.
          He lunges again at her, really violently. He seems to be
          really trying to hurt her.
          But HANNA has reached under her mattress and there is a flint
          knife - in an instant it is at ERIK's neck. She pricks his
          neck slightly. It bleeds just slightly. Stillness and
          silence. HANNA breathless, angry.ERIK (CONT'D)You didn't tell me you had a knife.HANNAYou told me to think for myself.
          Isn't that what you want?
          She is angry for the first time. ERIK does not answer. Just
          stares at her.HANNA (CONT'D)I want to see things. I can't stay
          here forever.10.21 EXT. LOG CABIN - NIGHT 21ERIK takes long lunging strides straight out from the cabin.
          He counts his paces.ERIKOne, two, three, four...22 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - DAY 22ERIK and HANNA are racing through the forest.
          Over this we continue to hear ERIK counting his paces from
          the previous scene.ERIK (V.O.)...five, six, seven, eight...23 EXT. LOG CABIN - NIGHT 23ERIK...nine, ten.
          After 10 paces, ERIK makes a 90 degree turn and enters the
          tree line. The snow and mud crunch under his boots.
          We continue to inter-cut the following with more close-ups of
          HANNA training: climbing, fighting, chin-ups, shooting. All
          the while we continue to hear ERIK counting out his paces.
          After 40 paces, with the cabin light distant, ERIK falls to
          his knees. He unsheathes a large knife and jams it into the
          frozen earth.24 EXT. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - MORNING 24HANNA comes out of the cabin, rubbing her eyes and yawning,
          eating a hunk of cold meat.
          She looks up to see a snow fox staring at her from the tree
          line. She crouches and holds out what's left of her
          breakfast.
          The fox approaches gingerly, delicately.HANNAHello little foxy... foxy loxy...
          come on... come and share my
          breakfast.
          The fox comes to her and nervously accepts the scrap,
          withdrawing a few feet to eat it. HANNA shuffles forward
          carefully and gently pats the snow fox - it is only a cub.11.As the fox eats it makes low grunting noises which HANNA
          expertly mimics - causing the fox to look up, puzzled - they
          seem to have a genuine connection - as if they've done this
          before.
          Suddenly the snow fox freezes, pricks up its ears, looks up,
          HANNA looks up too.
          An aeroplane is approaching overhead. The fox darts back into
          the undergrowth as the roar of the plane reverberates through
          the forest.
          HANNA jumps to her feet and with incredible speed and
          dexterity climbs to the very top of a near by tree. The plane
          roars over her head and disappears over the snowy wilderness,
          oblivious to HANNA'S tiny presence.
          It's only now that we see the full extent of HANNA'S
          isolation.25 INT. CABIN - MORNING. 25HANNA enters breathless with excitement. ERIK sits pensively
          with his back to the door.HANNADid you see it? Wasn't it
          beautiful, like thunder. I had to
          stick my fingers in my ears it was
          so loud. Did you hear it?
          She stops, sensing ERIK'S mood.HANNA (CONT'D)What's wrong?
          Sitting in front of ERIK is a metal case, caked with frozen
          dirt. ERIK pops open the case. Inside a tangle of technology.
          HANNA looks at the case, mesmerized.HANNA (CONT'D)What does it do?ERIKIt tells Marissa Wiegler where we
          are.
          He looks at her, a hint of a challenge.ERIK (CONT'D)When you want to leave here all you
          have to do is flip that switch.
          She approaches the box and places a single finger on the
          small red switch.12.ERIK (CONT'D)But once it's done, there'll be no
          going back. She'll never give up
          until you're dead, or she is. You
          understand? I wont be there to hold
          your hand. So be sure. Be sure it's
          what you really want.HANNAYou're not scaring me.
          He looks at her disbelievingly.
          She shakes her head in protest, but simultaneously moves away
          from the switch.
          He softens towards her.ERIKIt's here. There's no rush. Take
          your time.
          HANNA turns her back on the box, but can't help taking
          another look at it over her shoulder.26 INT. CABIN. HANNA'S ROOM - NIGHT 26HANNA is under the covers again while ERIK reads more from
          the encyclopedia.ERIKLaika, a mongrel dog from the
          streets of Moscow, was the first
          animal to orbit the Earth. She was
          launched into outer space on the
          third of November, 1957.
          Scientists believed humans would be
          unable to survive conditions of
          outer space, so flights by animals
          were viewed as an experimental
          precursor to human missions. Her
          rocket was not designed to be
          retrievable, and Laika had always
          been intended to die.HANNAThat's sad.
          ERIK awkwardly turns the page to change subject.ERIKWhen a star collapses the supernova
          explosion is 10 billion times
          brighter than other stars.
          HANNA shuts her eyes and tries to imagine how bright that
          might be.13.27 INT. LOG CABIN - MORNING 27ERIK straps the bow to his chest and grabs a quiver of bolts.ERIKWill you hunt with me?
          Hanna is sweeping the ground.HANNAIf you want.ERIKIt's up to you.HANNAMe?ERIKYes.
          HANNA eyes the box sitting open, it's waiting for her.HANNAI'll stay.ERIKFine.
          ERIK leaves abruptly.
          HANNA continues to sweep the ground, her movements bring her
          closer to the metal box. She stops sweeping and looks at the
          box. She turns and walks out of the cabin.28 EXT. LOG CABIN - CONTINUOUS 28HANNA comes out of the cabin and sits down on a tree trunk.
          She sees the snow fox cub but says nothing. It comes over and
          noses around the cabin, but HANNA'S mind is elsewhere.HANNA(whispering to herself)
          Marissa Wiegler.29 INT. LOG CABIN - CONTINUOUS 29CLOSE ON - the metal box, the switch catches the light from
          the door as HANNA enters to confront it. The room is still
          and quiet.
          HANNA approaches the metal box and slowly reaches out her
          hand.14.HANNA(WHISPER)Come and find me.
          CLOSE ON - She flips the switch, a little red light begins to
          flash.
          An ALARM CLOCK begins to ring as we cut to -30 INT. MARISSA'S APARTMENT. VIRGINIA. USA - EARLY MORNING 30CLOSE ON - a bedside alarm clock ringing loudly.
          MARISSA WIEGLER, a handsome woman in her mid-40's with red
          hair, reaches over and slams the alarm clock off.
          She's alone in her bed. She always is. She has no children.
          She's made choices in her life and lives without looking
          back.
          She walks into her ensuite bathroom and looks at herself in
          the mirror. She collects her toothbrush and bares her teeth
          in a snarl as she brushes them. Her gums bleed a little.31 INT. LOG CABIN - EVENING 31HANNA tends to boiling pots. She's cooking a feast. ERIK
          enters. He stamps his feet shedding ice at the door.
          He walks by the box and sees the little red light flickering
          on. HANNA sees this and sees him smile, but she knows he's
          sad.ERIKYou were lucky to grab that deer.
          There was nothing out there today.
          ERIK looks over at the meal HANNA is preparing.ERIK (CONT'D)Smells good.
          He wraps an arm around her shoulder. They don't hug much and
          it shows. HANNA is almost defensive and tense. And then the
          hug is over.32 EXT. CIA HQ LANGLEY VIRGINIA - DAY 32MARISSA, wearing a sharp business suit, drives a black Acura
          into her designated spot in the CIA HQ's car park.
          As she gets out, we see the parking space is designated forMARISSA WIEGLER.Her young male PA and TECH ONE are already waiting for her.15.TECH ONEMa'am. We've had a signal reported
          by Interpol. We think it's Eric
          Heller.
          An unusual expression of shock on MARISSA'S face.MARISSAWell I'll be.TECH ONEIt seems he's in Sweden. Jokkmokk.
          40 miles out.MARISSAWhat the fuck is he doing there?TECH ONELiving in the middle of nowhere,
          like the frigging Una Bomber.MARISSAThe son of a bitch. Sweden?
          Sweden?!
          The PA hands her a coffee and she hands him some files.TECH ONEApparently he turned on his
          locator.MARISSAHe's not an idiot.TECH ONEI know... I mean I believe so. But
          that's what happened.MARISSAAfter 14 years in Jokkmokk, maybe
          he'd rather go to prison.33 INT. LOG CABIN - NIGHT 33ERIK is leaning over a pail of water, cutting his beard off
          with a knife.MARISSA (V.O.)Eric Heller. From the Czech
          Republic. I recruited him in 1991

          ERIK, now clean shaven, opens a wooden case in the corner of
          the room and takes out an old folded three piece suit and
          rolled shirt.16.MARISSA (V.O.)He couldn't wait to kiss some

          looking faces, with her are her close advisors WALT and BOB.

          of her.MARISSATrouble was he had his own way of
          doing things. Kinda paranoid.
          WALT fires up a computer screen and logs on. He uses an
          access code. This takes him to a new file. He enters the
          tracking device number. A name comes up. ERIK HELLER.
          He clicks on a link. HELLER's face pops on to the screen.MARISSA (CONT'D)Not a team player. Not a “joiner.”
          He became increasingly isolated and
          disturbed. Kept mouthing off about
          classified programmes.
          WALT clicks on a link to a newspaper article which comes on
          to the screen: The headline: POLICE HUNT FOR MURDER SUSPECT.
          A picture of Heller in the article and a smashed car on a
          rural road. The two men stare at his face.MARISSA (CONT'D)I kept warning and he kept getting
          worse. In the summer of 1995 he
          took his girlfriend, Johanna Zadek,
          on a trip to the Baltic coast and
          blew her head off.
          WALT hits a new link: A still of the same young woman as the
          photo HANNA was previously looking at in her bedroom. Her
          name printed below it: JOHANNA ZADEK.MARISSA (CONT'D)Never heard from him again.BOBAnybody know why?MARISSA(DRYLY)Maybe the pressure got to him, Bob.

          poor woman and it's a cluster fuck.WALTTell it to Interpol. Let them pick
          him up. Try him for murder.BOBHe's right. This has nothing to do

          all.

          She smiles reassuringly at him.HANNAI'll see you there.36 EXT. LOG CABIN. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - NIGHT. 36ERIK comes out of the cabin carrying a small rucksack. He

          peaceful a place as you could imagine. A calm blueness of
          impending night on the snow.
          Then a series of ropes break the top frame and FIFTY US
          SPECIAL FORCES dressed in white snow gear silently abseil
          down to the ground.39 INT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - NIGHT 39HANNA is doing push-ups on her bedroom floor.40 EXT. FOREST/CABIN - NIGHT 40Infra-red POV as the SPECIAL OPS TEAM head through the forest

          We see through the infra-red vision the endless trees in the

          The SPECIAL OPS FORCES get closer. They see the cabin in the
          night. They approach. Silence in the darkness. Just the
          breathing of men in the icy cold.41 INT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - NIGHT 41HANNA stops her push-ups, sensing the SPECIAL FORCES
          approach.
          She silently springs to her feet and moves to the front of
          the cabin.
          She looks out and sees shadows moving among the trees.
          She turns and presses herself against the wall.20.42 EXT. LOG CABIN. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - NIGHT 42The HEAD OF OPS waves TWO SPECIAL OPERATIVES forward. The
          rest of the forces surround the cabin, but at a distance.
          The two men approach the cabin. One opens the door and the
          other steps in. Then the first follows close behind. Both are
          engulfed by darkness.
          The rest of the forces wait in silence for a radio signal.
          The HEAD of SPECIAL OPS looses patience and picks up the
          radio.HEAD OF OPSMcCullum? Do you read me?
          No response.HEAD OF OPS (CONT'D)I repeat, do you read me?
          The HEAD of OPS waves all thirty of his men closer to the

          smashing a glass test tube, she cuts the doctor's neck, then
          turns and does the same to the other one.
          HANNA looks round, trying to find a way out. Then she sees
          something on the desk. It is a file with a photo of herself
          clipped to it and a collection of papers - she scans it and
          reads in several places the letters “DNA.”
          But before she has time to read properly, she hears a female
          voice from outside the lab.FEMALE GUARDThis is Sanders. I'm checking Zone

          rests a moment, then hauls herself over the crest and
          immediately starts sliding... she tumbles, gathering pace,

          light. She crawls quickly towards it and stops at a kind of
          manhole cover with a sprung lever - she wrenches the lever
          and pushes against it. After a little effort the cover gives
          way and light floods in, blinding her.

          takes her eyes a moment to adjust to the blinding light.
          Blearily she looks out across this alien environment.
          After a moment her ears prick up. She turns just in time to
          see a column of Military Jeeps rise over a sand dune in the
          distance behind her. The jeeps are crawling straight towards
          her, ominously shimmering in the desert heat. She quickly
          ducks back down into her rabbit hole and waits.82 EXT. MOROCCAN DESERT 82In the middle of the desert the soldiers convene, looking for
          HANNA. A military truck is stationery. Nothing around for
          miles. We hear a military voice on a radio.MILITARY VOICE (V.O.)473 are you receiving me? Can you
          confirm your position. Subject has
          escaped.83 EXT. MOROCCAN DESERT. DAY. 83The truck moves off a short distance and stops again.
          Meanwhile a large convoy of Military Vehicles passes right
          over HANNA. When it has past she sees the first vehicle
          crawling to a halt right near the hole - just yards away.
          One of the MILITARY PERSONNEL in the jeep gets out and goes
          over to the hole, lifts the lid, inspects the darkness.
          The Truck radio is on and we hear the voice.MILITARY VOICECan you confirm your position 473?
          Banks? Banks can you hear me?32.Once BANKS is satisfied he walks away a few paces, gets out a
          pair of high powered binoculars, looks this way and that.
          He walks up a dune and scans the dunes with his binoculars.
          Finally he walks back and climbs into the Jeep, gets on the
          radio.BANKS.I'm at a perimeter opening at the
          far east wing. Something's not
          quite right...
          He doesn't notice but the lid is open now and the air-
          conditioning duct is empty.CUT TO:As the Jeep moves off we see HANNA is clinging to the axle,
          hanging upside down underneath. Her face is pressed to the
          oily metal, her back just an inch from the desert floor
          flashing beneath her.
          The jeeps now take a track along the edge of a steep dune.
          HANNA takes her chance and lets go of her grip. She clenches
          her eyes shut as the jeep passes over her. As soon as the
          jeeps clears she rolls herself over the edge of the dune.
          HANNA rolls down the sand dune at speed until finally she
          slows and stops. She lies still and shocked by the quiet as
          the Jeep disappears into the distance. Then she sits up and
          looks around herself. She has no conception of this
          landscape, no idea where she might be.84 INT. MARISSA'S APARTMENT. VIRGINIA. USA - NIGHT 84MARISSA moves between her wardrobe and a suitcase packing
          clothes, underwear, another power suit.
          Fully packed she goes to the back of the wardrobe and pulls
          aside some dresses to reveal a hidden safe. She keys in the
          security code, the safe door opens and from the back of the
          safe Marissa retrieves a blue file.
          MARISSA looks at the files title in large blunt letters:GALINKA.85 EXT. FOREST ROAD - FLASHBACK 85FLASHBACK to 1995.
          A much younger MARISSA watching a very fast-moving car on a
          deserted forest road. She takes from her pocket a small
          detonating device and as the car approaches a bend, presses
          it.33.There is a small explosion and the car swerves off the road
          and smashes headlong into a post. The horn starts to blare.
          MARISSA approaches the car. The road is empty. MARISSA looks
          through binoculars at the car.
          She sees a woman, on the passenger side, head thrust forward.
          JOHANNA ZADEK. Blood everywhere. MARISSA shoots her in the
          head just to be sure. But the driver's seat is empty. MARISSA
          stops dead.
          Then the back door opens on the other side. A man, a younger
          ERIK HELLER crawls out. He is holding a two year old child in
          his hands. The child's coat is covered in blood.
          MARISSA stares at the shocked child and takes the rifle to
          her eye to shoot again. As she does, ERIK senses her movement
          and throws himself to the ground.
          Through the rifle viewfinder we see just a glimpse of ERIK
          and the red glare of the coat covered in blood, ERIK HELLER
          grabbing the child and sprinting for the forest,
          MARISSA taking aim at HELLER, and then firing as HELLER dives
          into the forest.86 INT. MARISSA'S APARTMENT. VIRGINIA. USA - NIGHT 86PRESENT DAY.MARISSA puts on a pair of rubber kitchen gloves and sets fire
          to the file in the sink.
          When it's all burnt up she switches on the garbage disposal
          and pushes the ashen remains down the gurgler with a dish
          mop.87 EXT. MOROCCAN DESERT - LATER 87The sun has dipped a little now, the shadows of the dunes are
          longer, but the heat is still intense.
          HANNA's throat is parched by the dry heat, her pale eyes
          scorched by the angry sun. She walks purposefully but with a
          growing awareness of her tiny scale in this seemingly endless
          sea of sand. She has no conception of this landscape, no idea
          where she might be.HANNA(MUTTERING)I live in Leipzig. German city...
          0.7 Million people... I go to
          school at the Klaus Kohle
          Gymnasium... literature and
          sport... I have a dog called Trudi.34.HANNA climbs a steep dune, eyes down, feet pounding. A shadow
          falls across her path and she looks up to see the shape of a
          GIRL standing at the top of the dune silhouetted by the sun.
          HANNA's hand goes to the concealed gun.
          The GIRL stares at HANNA. They must be about the same age
          but there the resemblance ends. HANNA, dusty, bloodied and
          bruised in military top, trousers and boots stares at this
          perfect image of western adolescence. Dressed head to toe
          in pink and drinking a can of coke, no concession to where
          she is whatsoever. This is SOPHIE LYALL.SOPHIEHello.
          HANNA stares at her, then abruptly turns to walk in opposite
          direction until she sees another convoy of US military trucks
          in the distance.SOPHIE (CONT'D)All right?
          HANNA turns back. Looks at SOPHIE. Like a wary animal.SOPHIE (CONT'D)Don't you speak English?
          HANNA is unsure how to speak to this strange person.SOPHIE (CONT'D)That can't be helped. You look
          terrible.
          At that moment SOPHIE'S brother, MILES, eight years old,
          rises over the dune and stands by SOPHIE'S side. In his hand
          is a stills camera, not digital, film. MILES stares at HANNA
          while talking to SOPHIE.MILESWho's she?SOPHIEI don't know. I just found her.MILESWhat's her name?SOPHIEShe can't talk.HANNAHanna.MILESShe talked.35.HANNAI live in Leipzig. German city.
          Population 0.7 Million people. We
          live at Number 7 Weissingerplatz. I
          go to school at the Klaus Kohle
          Gymnasium and my best friends are
          Rudi Gunter and Clara Schliess. I
          like literature and sport, in
          particular tennis and athletics.MILES(RE' HANNA)She's weird.HANNAI also have a dog called Trudi.MILESWe had a dog called Vincent, but he
          went mad and died.SOPHIEI'm Sophie and this is my brother,
          Shit for Brains.
          From over the dune comes the voice of SOPHIE and MILES'S
          mother, RACHEL LYALL.RACHEL (O.S.)Come on, Sophie! We'll miss the
          light.
          MILES raises his camera to his eye and snaps a picture ofHANNA.MILESBye.SOPHIESee you.
          SOPHIE takes one more puzzled look at HANNA, then turns and
          disappears over the sand dune.
          HANNA rises to the top of the dune. SOPHIE turns back toHANNA.SOPHIE (CONT'D)Do you need a lift somewhere?HANNANo. I prefer to walk.SOPHIESuit yourself.36.SOPHIE and MILES head back towards their nouveau hippy
          parents, RACHEL and SEBASTIAN LYALL who are waiting for them
          beside an old VAN parked by a tarmac road that cuts straight
          through the desert.88 INT. AEROPLANE - NIGHT. 88MARISSA sitting in first class, trying to hide the fact that
          she's on her cell phone mid-flight. There's turbulence.LEWIS(O.O.V)She's in the desert east of
          Essouiara.MARISSAHave you got the DNA results?LEWISWe can't find them. It's possible
          she has them on her.
          Marissa takes that in.MARISSAOkay. I want you to focus on Erik
          Heller.LEWIS (O.O.V)Why?
          A sweet-faced male AIR STEWARD hovers over MARISSA.AIR STEWARDExcuse Madame, airline regulations
          state that -MARISSAI'm in conference.AIR STEWARDAll the same -MARISSABack off, honey. I'm busy.
          MARISSA'S response is so fierce that the AIR STEWARD
          instinctively does as he's told.LEWIS (O.O.V)You know this isn't going to go
          away.MARISSAI'm dealing with it Lewis.37.LEWIS (O.O.V)Okay but I just want you to admit -
          my Lord - how did she know to ask
          for you?
          She hangs up.89 EXT. DESERT/OASIS TOWN - DUSK 89HANNA walking along the side of a tarmac desert road,
          approaching a dusty oasis town.
          HANNA enters the outskirts, teaming with scooters, trucks,
          taxis, mules and goats. The impact knocks HANNA backwards,
          assailed by the smells of dried fruit, meat tagines, couscous
          cooking at market stalls, fresh fish and meat, still bloody
          and twitching, hanging in the sun for the flies. She listens
          to the babble of Arabic, her ears, nose and eyes sensitive to
          every conversation and twitch of life. It all overpoweringly
          exotic and visceral to her.
          An old broken-backed woman inches her way to market. HANNA
          stares at her in astonishment. Her wrinkled skin.
          She eyes the abundance of animals - animals she's never seen
          before in her life: Chickens. Goats. A camel, which Hanna
          finds bizarre and hilarious.90 INT. CENTRE OF TOWN/NIGHT MARKET - EVENING 90HANNA finds a stall with simple cotton clothing. She chooses
          some cheap clothes and unseen goes around the back of the
          stall. She changes out of her ragged old clothes into her new
          clothes.
          HANNA sees MILES running through the crowds carrying a bag of
          cherries.
          She follows him a little way, onto a busy street with hotels
          and cheap jewellery stores.
          He runs up the steps and enters a small mid-range hotel.
          HANNA looks up at the hotel, then enters.91 INT. MOROCCAN HOTEL RECEPTION - EVENING 91HANNA stands at the reception desk. A kindly looking HOTEL
          OWNER is eating a jammy biscuit. He's a little confused byHANNA.HOTEL OWNERWhere's your family?38.HANNAAre you Arab?HOTEL OWNERI'm Moroccan.HANNAMorocco. Capital city Rabat. Places
          of interest. Marrakesh. Essouaira.
          Religion Islam. Language Arabic
          (in Arabic w/ EnglishSUBTITLES)I like Arabic very much. It's like
          Japanese. It's big.
          The HOTEL OWNER nearly spits out his biscuit in shock.HOTEL OWNER(in Arabic w/ EnglishSUBTITLES)You speak Arabic?HANNA(in Arabic w/ EnglishSUBTITLES)Yes, of course.HOTEL OWNER(in Arabic w/ EnglishSUBTITLES)Where's your family?HANNA(in Arabic w/ EnglishSUBTITLES)I need a room for one night. Can
          you help? I don't have any money.92 INT. MOROCCAN HOTEL BEDROOM - EVENING 92The HOTEL OWNER leads HANNA into a simple whitewashed hotel
          room with twin beds.
          They speak in Arabic with English subtitles.HOTEL OWNERIt's the best we've got.HANNAThank you.
          HANNA stares at the light switch.HANNA (CONT'D)Do you have one of these in every
          room?39.HOTEL OWNEROf course. All mod cons.HANNAIt's electricity?
          The HOTEL OWNER looks at HANNA askance.HOTEL OWNERYes.HANNAI know a little bit about
          electricity. They say Edison
          discovered it, or was it Franklin?HOTEL OWNERSome American, I'm sure.
          He picks up an electric kettle.HOTEL OWNER (CONT'D)Electric kettle for the English -
          they like to make their own tea.
          He switches it on, Hanna stares as it heats up noisily.
          He goes to a small wall mounted TV, switches it on for her, a
          fuzzy, terrible picture of an Arabic TV show. HANNA is
          fascinated, doesn't take her eyes off the TV as she sits on
          the edge of the bed.HANNAWhat is it?HOTEL OWNERIt's the best we can do.
          She stares at the picture, bemused.HOTEL OWNER (CONT'D)Where do you come from?
          Distracted, HANNA is caught off guard.HANNAThe forest.
          The HOTEL OWNER smiles, himself a little puzzled by this
          strange encounter, and leaves.
          She just sits there staring at the TV as it's volume seems to
          increase.
          Meanwhile the electric kettle begins to boil. Steam pours
          from its spout and the whole contraption starts to rattle
          violently.40.HANNA gets up and approaches the kettle very warily. She
          tries the light switch in an attempt to stop the kettle, but
          it keeps boiling and making its strange rattle. HANNA tries
          another switch, the ceiling fan begins to turn, confusing
          HANNA even more.
          On the TV the news shows footage of war in the Middle East,
          the sound of gunfire.
          The ceiling fan is at its top speed, it's blades cut the air
          like a helicopter.
          A telephone beside the bed starts to ring.
          Combined the noises rise to a terrifying crescendo.
          HANNA backs away towards the bathroom. She stumbles and falls
          through the bathroom door straight into the shower,
          inadvertently turning the taps on. Water pours down on her.
          HANNA springs up and turns to face the stream of water as if
          it were an attacker. She runs back into the bedroom.
          In the bedroom the kettle is still having a violent tantrum,
          the TV is still screaming, the fan still cutting, the phone
          still shouting.
          HANNA pulls at the exit door, but doesn't know to turn the
          handle. She panics. Smashes at the door. Eventually she falls
          through the door and into the corridor.93 INT. MOROCCAN HOTEL CORRIDOR - EVENING 93Silence as HANNA sits on the corridor floor catching her
          breath.
          A little way down the corridor MILES and SOPHIE emerge from
          their bedroom.MILESLook. It's that girl.
          He nudges SOPHIE.
          HANNA eyes them suspiciously.SOPHIEHey you made it.MILESHey, again.SOPHIEDid you walk here?MILESShe looks different.41.SOPHIEDo you want to hang with us?MILESAre you hungry?SOPHIEMiles is always hungry.HANNAI'm thirsty.94 EXT/INT. STRIP CLUB. HAMBURG. 94The Reeperbaln, the main street of Hamburg's red light
          district. Tough and unglamorous. MARISSA WIEGLER gets out of
          a taxi, checks the sign of the strip club and crosses the
          road. She is on the phone and we hear.LEWIS (O.S.)The Swedish borders are sealed. I
          have Swedish, Norwegian and Danish
          border patrols on high alert and
          Interpol have briefed the police.MARISSAI don't want any bad news Lewis.
          Neither of us can afford a fuck up.
          MARISSA hangs up. She enters a converted car park which is
          now a lap dancing bar. It's early in the day and the patrons
          are as scarce as the clothes on the dancers.
          At the far end of the room is the reason Marissa is there,
          MICHAEL ISAACS. Mid fifties. Rumpled suit, bleary, unshaven
          and drinking a scotch.
          ISAACS smiles coldly at MARISSA.ISAACSI didn't think they let women in
          here.MARISSAThey let them in, they just don't
          let them get dressed.
          He smiles, drinks, she eyes the scotch.MARISSA (CONT'D)Still drinking on the job. You
          haven't changed.ISAACSYou have.42.MARISSAAdapt or die.ISAACSYou want a drink?MARISSAI'll wait until I really need one.
          He grins and drinks. She sits, with a sigh, looks him in the
          eye.MARISSA (CONT'D)Erik Heller's still alive.
          ISAACS glances up from his drink.ISAACSYou don't say.MARISSAThere's more.
          MARISSA passes him a newspaper. He opens it. Hidden inside is
          a picture of Hanna. He looks it over, surprised.ISAACS (IRONIC)Wow. All grown up.MARISSAHe did a good job.ISAACSDid she turn out like you hoped?MARISSAShe just tried to kill me.ISAACSIsn't it always the way?MARISSAThe fuck does that mean?ISAACSYou bring them into this world,
          teach them how to kill and maim...
          and then they turn against you.MARISSAI didn't teach her.ISAACSNo, it's better than that. You bred
          her from a test tube.
          MARISSA turns to the BARMAN and signals for a round of the
          scotches, “Two of these...”43.MARISSAHere's the problem: She thinks we
          killed her mother.
          He smiles wryly.ISAACSJust get her sectioned or
          something.MARISSASure, just as soon as she's done
          breaking peoples necks. You get her
          sectioned, if you can catch her.
          The drinks arrive, MARISSA drinks.MARISSA (CONT'D)Right now she's in Morocco but
          she'll be trying to get out of the
          country. Find her and bring her to
          me. Quietly.ISAACSI'll need funds.
          MARISSA slides an envelope of bills across the table.MARISSADon't spend it all on candy.
          She glances meaningfully at the STRIPPERS, who have been
          eyeing up ISAACS as a potential mark.
          ISAACS looks at the money. When he looks back up MARISSA is
          already walking out the door.95 EXT. NIGHT MARKET RESTAURANT. OASIS TOWN - NIGHT 95HANNA is sitting at a table with the FAMILY who are all
          eating falafel while HANNA eats meat.
          SOPHIE and MILES parents, RACHEL and SEB, have some
          difficulty relating to their daughters attitudes. They belong
          to a generation of counter cultural radicals whose priorities
          have, over the past decade, shifted and they're now trying to
          assimilate into mainstream society whilst still holding on to
          their ideals of autonomy and social liberation.
          SOPHIE is describing a recent cultural phenomenon while she
          picks at her food.SOPHIEShe's beautiful. I wish I had a
          body like hers. She's really cool
          too. She's married to a footballer
          and really loves him -44.Meanwhile HANNA eyes the crowd, constantly on the look out.SOPHIE (CONT'D)- only the papers found out he was
          shagging like loads of other girls
          so she went and got all successful
          in her own right and now does a
          make-over show where she turns
          right dogs into real babes. I could
          do you a make-over if you'd like?RACHELPerhaps Hanna doesn't want a make-
          over, sweetie.
          SOPHIE ignores RACHEL and addresses all her responses toHANNA.SOPHIERachel doesn't believe in making
          the best of yourself.RACHELNo Sophie, I just don't believe
          fourteen year-old girls should be
          dressing to look like porn stars.
          It objectifies them.SOPHIE(TO HANNA)Do you shave your armpits yet?HANNAI don't think so.RACHELGood. Keep it that way.SOPHIEThat's SOOO gross.RACHELDo you often travel on your own,
          Hanna?HANNAMy father encourages me to be

          SOPHIE is weirdly impressed.96 EXT/INT. BUTCHERS SHOP. SOUTH SWEDEN - NIGHT 96ERIK HELLER, still wearing his three piece suit, enters a
          tiny provincial Swedish butchers shop and walks up to the
          counter. He checks around to make sure no one is following
          him before approaching the BUTCHER and slapping some cash on
          the counter.HELLERThree pounds of goose fat if you
          please.97 INT. MOROCCAN HOTEL CORRIDOR - LATER 97HANNA arrives back at the hotel with RACHEL, SEB, MILES and
          SOPHIE. MILES is sleepy and SOPHIE a little grumpy.SOPHIEWhy do we always have to get up so
          early?SEBIf you were a Berber shepherd -SOPHIE- I'm not a shepherd. Jesus.RACHELWe have to be at the port by eight
          tomorrow so I want you to pack
          now...MILESI'm too sleepy.
          HANNA listens anxiously, knowing she needs to go with them to
          be safe.
          She arrives at her door.46.HANNAGood night.
          But the family are too wrapped up in their discussion to
          notice her.SEBNo, you're not. Come on we'll do it
          together.
          HANNA enters her room. SOPHIE turns at the sound of HANNA'S
          door closing.SOPHIEShe's weird. Is it me, or is that
          girl weird?98 INT. MOROCCAN HOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT 98The TV flickers illuminating HANNA as she sits on her bed
          looking at the DNA report folded up into a tight wad. She
          smooths it out and reads.
          The test reads: HANNA HELLER - “SGM + test results.
          Interfering sequence present. Abnormal. B sample confirmsRESULT�HANNA stares at the words. “Interfering sequence present.
          Abnormal.” HANNA looks at the photo of herself and those
          words.HANNA�ABNORMAL�What does it mean?
          She looks up at the TV and sees footage of millions of Muslim
          worshipers circling the Kaaba at Mecca. The sheer mass of
          humanity stuns her. HANNA turns up the volume and hears the
          call to prayer.
          She listens in wonder to her first experience of music.HANNA (CONT'D)(WHISPERS)Music. A combination of sounds with
          a view to beauty of form and
          expression of emotion.
          She breathes in the beautiful sounds.99 EXT. SOUTH SWEDISH COAST - PRE-DAWN 99The music continues over -47.A barren rocky outcrop on the South Swedish coast. HELLER
          arrives. He has a rucksack on his back.
          HELLER undresses and puts his suit in a plastic bag that he
          knots tight. He puts the bag into the rucksack and puts it on
          his back.
          Then HELLER starts to cover his body in the goose fat he
          bought in the butcher's. He stares across the water towards
          DENMARK in the distance.100 EXT. HOTEL CAR PARK. - PRE-DAWN 100HANNA appears in the blue morning light and stalks around the
          car park looking for the family van.
          When she finds it, she tries the doors but they're locked.
          She tries the back door but that's also locked.
          She gets her foot onto a wheel and another foot onto a
          doorhandle and climbs up onto the roof.101 EXT. VAN/ROOF - PRE-DAWN 101She studies the sun roof of the recreational vehicle. It has
          been left open a few inches for air.
          She gets her hands in there and tries to prise it open
          further but it's mechanised and won't budge.
          She looks around the car park for an implement.
          She spies a fire escape with a caretaker's nook next to it.
          She climbs back down off the van and goes to the caretaker's
          room.102 INT. CARETAKER'S ROOM - PRE-DAWN 102HANNA searches the tiny office until she finds a crowbar.103 EXT. FERRYPORT. MOROCCO. DAY 103A busy bustling ferry-port, cars in both directions.
          ISAACS looks round, makes silent contact with other men. His
          men. Four of them dotted around the ferryport.
          ISAACS approaches a BORDER GUARD. The GUARD is looking at a
          photocopied photo of HANNA from her holding cell. The GUARD
          pockets the photocopy as ISAACS passes him a wad of cash.48.104 INT. VAN - DAY. 104THE FAMILY travels towards the ferry-port, sleepy and grumpy,
          yawning, looking around.
          The sun roof to the rear, above the breakfast table and bench
          seats, is wide open.SEB... Somebody broke the sun roof. I
          said somebody broke the sun roof.
          It won't close...RACHELCall the rental.SEBI hope its insured.105 EXT. FERRYPORT. MOROCCO - CONTINUOUS 105ISAACS watches closely every car that approaches the ferry
          from behind his dark glasses.
          He sees the FAMILY have joined a cue of vehicles and are
          having their papers checked. Then they're waved on board. He
          scrutinises them but has no reason to suspect anything.106 INT. FERRY CAR DECK. - DAY 106Cars are parking, their headlights on in the dark hull, horns
          blowing, FERRY GUARDS directing people to parking spaces -
          it's chaos.
          SEB parks the van with some difficulty, complaining all the
          while.SEBTypical. Get me back to the
          European Union.RACHELDon't be rude.
          They get out, taking with them anything they might need -
          knapsacks, computer games, suit cases.
          They head off towards the stairs up to the decks, passing
          ISAACS on their way.
          ISAACS searches between the cars and trucks.
          He passes the back of the FAMILY'S van as the camera pushes
          in on its back door. The handle is being JIGGLED FROM INSIDE.49.107 INT. VAN/FERRY CAR DECK - DAY 107Inside, the van is as the family left it, but the bench seats
          around the breakfast table are disturbed. One has been opened
          out, the lid taken off, the mattress strewn on the floor -
          inside is a big storage space where HANNA has evidently
          hidden... The crowbar has been discarded there.
          HANNA is trying to get out. She tries the back door but its
          locked.
          She climbs over the seats and climbs into the front cabin,
          the driver's seat. She finds a lock on the door and unlocks.
          She climbs out.108 EXT. LOWER FERRY DECK - DAY 108HANNA walks out on deck and sees the sea, the sight of it
          takes her breath away. She walks to the railings and looks
          over the edge. Then up at the seagulls following the boat.
          A little way off the FAMILY are sitting eating ice-creams.
          SOPHIE lies out on a bench sunning herself.RACHELWhat has got into you? Oh my God,
          look over there.
          They all look where she is pointing - at HANNA.SOPHIEIt's her.SEBYou think she... you don't think
          she... Rachel, the sunroof?RACHELYou think we should say something?SEBWhat's there to say?RACHELMaybe she's in trouble.SEBMaybe she's a hooker. Or a
          terrorist. There's a lot of them in
          Germany.SOPHIEHookers or terrorists?RACHELI'll go over.50.SEBRachel, walk away. I'm insisting
          here. I'm putting my foot down...
          RACHEL heads off towards HANNA, SOPHIE follows.CUT TO:SOPHIE and RACHEL approach HANNA and move to positions either
          side of her.SOPHIEAll right?HANNADid you know that 71 percent of the
          earths surface is covered in water?SOPHIEMy father thinks you're a stowaway.
          He thinks you broke our sunroof
          too, which puts you in deep shit.RACHELSophie just - I'll handle this.(TO HANNA)Where's your father?
          No reply.RACHEL (CONT'D)I really think it might help if you
          told us the, you know, the truth
          and all that. Have you run away
          from somewhere?SOPHIEAre you okay?HANNAI'm fine.RACHELI'm worried about you.SOPHIEShe said she's fine.RACHELYou have to understand this really
          is a problem for us.51.SOPHIEYou know what? Why don't I stay
          here with her and you go off and be
          with dad? He's looking kind of
          tense.CUT TO:RACHEL rejoins SEB and MILES.SEBHas she even got a passport?!RACHELI don't think I handled that very
          well.SEBHow do you know she's not some kind
          of illegal immigrant?109 EXT. UPPER FERRY DECK - CONTINUOUS 109ISAACS searches the upper deck. Through the bar on the other
          side of the ferry he sees one of his men searching the
          opposite deck.
          A CHILD knocks into ISAACS and the few photocopied
          photographs he has of HANNA fall from his pocket and are
          blown along the deck.
          ISAACS scrambles to pick-up the photocopies.110 EXT. LOWER FERRY DECK - CONTINUOUS 110HANNA and SOPHIE are still standing at the railings. SOPHIE
          offers HANNA some of her ice-cream.SOPHIEWould you like some?
          HANNA looks curiously at the ice-cream.HANNAPlease.
          She tries it.HANNA (CONT'D)It tastes like music.SOPHIEYou're so weird, aren't you? Did
          you have a fight with your dad or
          something?52.HANNAYes.SOPHIEWas it bad?HANNANo. I won.
          HANNA studies the sea.HANNA (CONT'D)Can you help me get home?
          At that moment one of ISAACS photocopied pictures of HANNA
          rolls across the deck and catches on the railings.
          HANNA looks down at it, recognizes herself and quickly
          pockets it. She looks across the deck, too many people, she
          shouldn't have let herself be so exposed.HANNA (CONT'D)You could do me a make-over if you
          like?111 INT. VAN. FERRY CAR DECK - DAY 111MILES is sitting in the driver's seat, pretending to drive
          the stationary van.
          Through the windscreen, RACHEL and SEB can be seen having a
          heated discussion.
          In the back, HANNA is changing into some of SOPHIE'S clothes.SOPHIEYou're pretty. You know that?HANNAAm I?SOPHIEOf course you are. You've got
          pretty eyes and you're tall. I
          always wanted to be tall. If I were
          a man I might fancy you.
          She laughs. HANNA responds seriously.HANNAI'm not a man.
          SOPHIE laughs even more.
          The door swings open and SEB is standing there with RACHEL,
          nervous but determined.53.SEBOkay, here's the deal. We're going
          to find a way to get you home just
          as soon as we get off this crate.
          But since you don't have a passport
          with you right now, we're just
          going to have to be a bit gorilla.
          Okay?RACHELWe passionately believe it's the
          right thing to do.
          They don't look sure at all, but SOPHIE puts her arm round
          HANNA and HANNA returns the gesture, everybody slightly
          embarrassed.112 EXT. FERRY PORT ALGECIRAS - DAY 112The FERRY is docked, the huge doors are open and cars are
          starting to drive out, halting on the dock to have passports
          checked.113 INT. VAN. FERRY CAR DECK. - DAY 113Cars are revving up, manoeuvring and getting ready to
          disembark.
          RACHEL is at the drivers wheel while SEB is in the back
          stripping the cushions from the bench seats to prepare a
          place for HANNA to hide.
          HANNA waits, breath bated, her arm round SOPHIE's shoulders.
          On the far side she sees ISAACS enter the deck. She watches
          him carefully and decides he must be looking for her. She
          ducks down a little further.
          RACHEL, looking nervous, turns to HANNA.RACHELYou okay honey?HANNAYes yes I'm ready!
          ISAACS is getting closer, walking between the cars. The ferry
          gates are open and the noise subsides.
          SEB discovers the crowbar, examines it.SEBOh Jesus.
          HANNA grabs it and sticks it back in the box, helps SEB fling
          cushions aside and gets into the compartment.54.SEB grits his teeth.SEB (CONT'D)Here goes nothing.
          He shuts the bench seat over HANNA and replaces the cushions
          just as ISAACS passes the van, sniffing around.
          SEB gets out of the back and walks around to the front. He
          passes ISAACS on his way round.SEB (CONT'D)Excuse me. Sir?
          ISAACS gets out of the way and SEB gets into the front
          passenger's seat. RACHEL starts the engine, checks her
          mirrors.
          SEB eyes ISAACS with some paranoia - although he has no idea
          who he is.INSIDE HANNA'S HIDE OUT -HANNA lies quietly, her eyes glistening in the dark. She
          listens, hearing the van disembarking the ferry.114 EXT. DANISH COASTLINE - DAY 114Dark rain pours down on to a beach on the Danish coast.
          A figure struggles to land. Then, like a monster from the
          deep, ERIK emerges out of the surf. His lungs bursting with
          the exertion. Water dripping from his body.
          He collapses for a while then stumbles up the beach. He
          approaches the beach car park.
          A POLICE CAR swings into the car park.
          ERIK tries to run, but it's too late. The POLICE CAR is on
          him.
          He stops and turns towards the police car.
          TWO POLICEMEN get out of the car and approach ERIK. He
          watches them very carefully.115 EXT. MOTORWAY/SOUTHERN SPAIN - DAY 115The FAMILY'S van speeds along the E-15 up from the Bay of
          Gibraltar, heading north east towards the mountains.55.116 INT. VAN - DAY 116HANNA stares out at the changing light in the rugged
          landscape.
          Hills are emerging and the land is turning green in the gold
          evening light.
          HANNA watches RACHEL unscrew the cap of a water bottle and
          brings it to SEB'S mouth while he drives. SEB laughs as a
          little water spills down his front.
          SOPHIE is listening to an iPOD. HANNA looks at her. SOPHIE
          takes one earphone out of her own ear and puts it in HANNA's.117 INT. MARITIME SECURITY/OFFICE - DAY 117ISAACS shows fake ID to the ferry's frowning SECURITY
          OFFICER, who doesn't appreciate the unsolicited approach.ISAACSSir, I'll be as brief as I can, we
          have a situation here...118 INT. MARITIME SECURITY/OFFICE - LATER 118ISAACS is studying CC TV footage of the ferry. He views a
          number of scenes with no luck until he notices:
          The car deck - HANNA and SOPHIE weaving through the cars and
          boarding the van.119 INT. VAN - DAY 119HANNA rests her head on SOPHIE'S shoulder and relaxes for the
          first time. MILES relaxes his head on HANNA's shoulder and
          they stare at the huge, granite mountain range...
          She starts to nod off... she falls asleep on SOPHIE's
          shoulder.120 EXT. DANISH COASTLINE - DAY 120MARISSA walks along the desolate patch of coastline. She
          approaches a Crime Scene. Dogs, markings on the ground. Two
          DANISH POLICEMEN lie inert on the pebbles, their throats
          freshly sliced.LEWISThe Danish authorities are taking
          this very seriously. They've
          doubled the number of officers on
          the ground. We've sent up spotter
          planes over the channel.(MORE)56.LEWIS (CONT'D)They're appealing for witnesses
          through the local media...
          MARISSA nods and looks out at the roiling grey sea. The
          reality of ERIK'S determination unnerving her.LEWIS (CONT'D)You think he really swam it?
          MARISSA knows he did. She calls over her shoulder as she
          walks away.MARISSAKeep me posted.121 EXT. SPANISH CAMPSITE - DAY 121The campsite is heaving with humanity, thousands of EUROPEAN
          CAMPERS who have turned the site into what amounts to a
          shanty town - a small city with its own shops, drainage,
          borders and rules. Families come here from cities across
          Europe and bring their whole lives with them.
          The LYALL FAMILY van is squeezed in between a GERMAN family
          walking around in skimpy swimming costumes - and a serious
          looking FRENCH family with quad bikes.
          SOPHIE, MILES and HANNA stare at the other families a moment.GERMAN CAMPER.Guten tag.HANNAGuten Morgen.GERMAN CAMPER.Wie geht es Ihnen?HANNAGutm und Ihnen?GERMAN CAMPER.Jah, gut, gut...
          A FRENCH CAMPER nods at them.FRENCH CAMPER.Bonjour. Ca va?HANNACa va. Oui. Bien...
          HANNA starts efficiently helping SEB erect the children's
          tent. He's watches impressed as HANNA expertly ties
          complicated knots.
          RACHEL and MILES start blowing up two inflatable mattresses.57.RACHELMaybe we could all go for a walk
          when we've put the tent up.SOPHIENo thanks.
          HANNA looks off to the tree line. In the distance she spots a
          couple of RABBITS in a pool of sunlight.122 INT. SPANISH CAMPSITE. OFFICE/SHOP. 122HANNA turns a display unit of postcards.
          Through the window she can see SOPHIE talking to TWO TEENAGEBOYS.One of the boys enters the shop. He looks at HANNA as he
          passes and smiles. This is FELICIANO. He is handsome. HANNA'S
          not used to this feeling of being looked at.
          While the SHOP ASSISTANT serves FELICIANO HANNA pockets a
          postcard and a book of stamps.123 EXT. SPANISH CAMPSITE. OFFICE/SHOP. 123HANNA sits on a low wall writing her postcard:
          ‘Mission accomplished'
          HANNA gets up and posts the card.124 EXT. WOODS NEAR CAMPSITE - DAY 124RACHEL and HANNA are walking in the woods together. Above
          them the evening chorus is in full song.RACHELI just feel connected when I'm in
          the countryside. The city stifles
          me... emotionally, creatively.
          HANNA'S attention is elsewhere, she's spotted something in
          the undergrowth.RACHEL (CONT'D)Anyway, I was very young when I...
          Seb and I.... He was so impressive.
          HANNA suddenly runs into the woods.RACHEL (CONT'D)Hanna?!58.125 EXT. SPANISH CAMPSITE - EVENING 125The FAMILY are sitting in fold-out chairs eating charred
          veggie sausages.SOPHIEIt's probably just a bunch of
          Spanish farmers, mum. We're hardly
          going to be out all night.RACHELYou're not going, Sophie. No way,
          Jose.
          HANNA appears from the woods carrying TWO SKINNED RABBITS.
          She lays them in front of the family.HANNAFood.
          SOPHIE lets out a shriek of nervous laughter, while SEB and
          RACHEL are confused as to what the appropriate reaction might
          be.MILESThat's gross.126 INT. CAMPSITE PUBLIC BATHROOM - NIGHT 126The girls are hiding out in the Ladies Room as SOPHIE does
          HANNA'S make-up.SOPHIEI don't know why I'm doing this,
          you're going to steal all the best
          men off of me.HANNAWhat do you mean?SOPHIEThough quite frankly I don't need
          more digits than I've got right
          now. Loads. Loads and loads.
          HANNA watches herself in the mirror. Mascara, eye liner. She
          licks the lipstick, puzzled. Almost a woman, but it doesn't
          look right on her.HANNAIt's like paint.SOPHIEDon't lick it off.
          SOPHIE finishes HANNA's face, looks at her in the mirror.59.SOPHIE (CONT'D)You're gorgeous.127 EXT. CAMPSITE. NIGHT. 127SOPHIE and HANNA sneak through the campsite together and move
          secretly between the parked cars. HANNA is dressed in some of
          SOPHIE's clothes and has the make-up on. They are excited,
          SOPHIE alive with the thrill of disobedience.HANNAI can't walk in this.SOPHIEYou look hot.HANNAWhere are we going?SOPHIEShhhhh!
          HANNA uncomfortable with the situation.HANNAI shouldn't take unnecessary risks.SOPHIESays who?
          SOPHIE heads off down the road.
          HANNA weighs the situation and then quickens her pace to
          catch up with SOPHIE.128 EXT. RAVE AT ROMAN AMPHITHEATRE. NIGHT. 128A loud out door rave in a Roman amphitheatre.
          SOPHIE and HANNA stand at the top of the amphitheatre looking
          down on the thrilling spectacle, soaking up the bass, the
          abstract sounds, the sheer volume, the pulsing lights and
          electric atmosphere - HANNA is thrilled and startled.
          Many of the crowd seem to be wearing fancy dress. HANNA
          stares at a girl dressed as a red ladybird.CUT TO:The girls approach a bar and SOPHIE goes to order. She's
          forced to mime and shout her order over the music.SOPHIEVodka. Two.60.The bartender shakes his head and holds up two bottles of
          water.BARTENDERWater only. No booze.
          Meanwhile HANNA spots FELICIANO, the handsome SPANISH BOY
          from the camp site shop, across the dance floor. He is
          staring at her again.
          SOPHIE comes back with two bottles of water and hands one toHANNA.HANNAWhat do they call this music?SOPHIEBanging.
          HANNA stares at the dancers, people losing themselves in it -
          SOPHIE just grins, starts to move to the music.
          HANNA smiles awkwardly, tries to copy SOPHIE.CUT TO:ISAACS enters the rave followed by two of his HENCHMEN. They
          split up and start to survey the crowd.
          Over in a secluded corner ISAACS sees a drug deal taking
          place.
          ISAACS sidles over to the DEALER and his PUNTER. The PUNTER,
          thinking ISAACS is probably a cop, makes a hasty getaway.ISAACSWhat you got?DEALER(in Spanish w/ EnglishSUBTITLES)Nothing man. That guys just a
          friend.
          ISAACS frisks the DEALER, nothing. He turns the DEALER
          against the wall and checks his socks where he finds a stash
          of tiny baggies each containing a gram or two of white
          powder.
          ISAACS samples the powder and pockets the lot.DEALER (CONT'D)(in Spanish w/ EnglishSUBTITLES)Hey, you're not police. What the
          fuck?
          ISAACS turns as he walks away and puts a finger to his lips.61.ISAACSSsh.CUT TO:Back near the bar HANNA and SOPHIE are approached by a couple
          of scrawny SPANISH BOYS in day-glow tops.SPANISH BOY(in Spanish w/ EnglishSUBTITLES)Where are you from?
          The girls just look at each other.SPANISH BOY (CONT'D)English? American? You like to
          party?
          They watch, puzzled, as SOPHIE smiles disinterestedly and
          leads HANNA away.HANNAWill you teach me to do dancing?SOPHIEIt's easy.
          HANNA and SOPHIE walk onto the dance floor and begin to
          dance.
          HANNA starts by dancing like a five year-old, swinging her
          arms jerkily and lifting her feet as if walking through a
          field. But soon her movements become more sophisticated and
          expressive.CUT TO:ISAACS is searching through the crowd. He eyes the bodies
          around him greedily.
          He takes another dab of the white powder and rubs it into his
          gums.CUT TO:Back on the dance floor, HANNA and SOPHIE are dancing.
          FELICIANO approaches through the crowd followed by a FRIEND.
          THEY start to circle HANNA and SOPHIE, dancing, insinuating
          their way in.SOPHIE (CONT'D)He's after you.HANNAHow can you tell?62.SOPHIEDuh, look at the way he's looking
          at you. He's gorgeous.
          FELICIANO'S FRIEND approaches SOPHIE, he's not bad looking
          either.FELICIANO'S FRIENDWhat's your name?SOPHIESophie.FELICIANO'S FRIENDHave you come here before?SOPHIEAll the time.FELICIANO'S FRIENDReally? You dance well.SOPHIESo do you.
          HANNA and FELICIANO hold eye contact.
          The music rises and now they're lit only by the intermittent
          flashes of a strobe light.
          HANNA and FELICIANO begin to dance around each other, their
          movements caught in still flashes.CUT TO:From some distance away ISAACS spots HANNA. He smiles and
          starts to move through the crowds towards her.CUT TO:SOPHIE and the FRIEND are kissing. HANNA sees this and
          laughs.
          The crowd is jumping.
          HANNA feels FELICIANO'S hand take hers, she flinches a
          moment, then lets him draw her towards him. Their eyes still
          locked.
          ISAACS is getting closer, his eyes flashing eerily in the
          strobe lighting.
          HANNA and FELICIANO are in a world of their own.
          His fingers trace the lines of her arms, shoulders and neck.
          He draws her face towards his.63.HANNAAre we going to kiss now?FELICIANOWould you like to?HANNAKissing requires a total of thirty-
          four facial muscles.
          Their lips are almost touching.HANNA (CONT'D)The most important muscle involved
          is the orbicularis oris muscle,
          which is used to pucker the lips -
          He kisses her.
          HANNA closes her eyes.
          ISAACS moves in.
          FELICIANO becomes more ardent, puts his arms around her
          waist, she doesn't like it. He tries to open her mouth with
          his.
          HANNA snaps.
          In a few swift moves, HANNA pulls FELICIANO round and throws
          him to the ground. She falls to his side and, with one knee
          on his back, she holds his head, about to snap his neck.
          SOPHIE turns and sees them on the ground. A few of the
          closest DANCERS also stop dancing and stare.
          ISAACS backs off, watching from a safe distance.SOPHIEHanna! Holy crap...FELICIANOPlease, don't hurt me.(TO SOPHIE)Please, tell your friend...
          HANNA looks up at SOPHIE. Now that she has FELICIANO on the
          ground she doesn't know what to do with him.HANNAShould I let him go?SOPHIEAs opposed to what? Yes, you should
          let him go.
          HANNA leans in to whisper into FELICIANO'S ear.64.HANNAI'm going to go now.FELICIANOSure.HANNAIt was nice.
          And she's gone, pulling SOPHIE away through the crowd.
          ISAACS jumps into action. But he's lost sight of the girls
          among the mass of dancing bodies.
          HANNA and SOPHIE move quickly through the crowds towards the
          exit.SOPHIEOh, my God, Hanna. I thought you
          were going to kill him. Where d'you
          learn to do that?HANNAMy father taught me.
          They escape through a hole in the perimeter fence.129 129NIGHTAn immaculately tidy lounge in a small apartment on the
          ground floor of a run down East Berlin housing project.
          A well-dressed woman in her 60's, KATRIN, is sitting alone
          listening to music on an old casette machine.
          The door buzzer rings. KATRIN gets up slowly and approaches
          the door.KATRINWho is it?
          No reply. KATRIN puts the safety chain across the door and
          opens it a small amount.MARISSAHello Katrin.
          KATRIN slams the door shut in fright and double locks it.
          Fear racing through her veins, she rushes her way through the
          lounge, knocking furniture as she goes.130 INT. KITCHEN. KATRIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 130KATRIN races to the kitchen door and bolts it.65.Thinking the apartment is secure, she tries to catch her
          breath. But slowly she becomes aware of someone else's
          presence in the room.
          She turns to face the intruder... MARISSA standing, waiting
          patiently.KATRINYou look different in pictures.MARISSAWell here I am in the flesh.
          KATRIN'S mouth twitches with all the imagined conversations
          she's had with MARISSA.MARISSA (CONT'D)Has Erik Heller contacted you?KATRINErik's dead.
          MARISSA sits calmly in an old arm chair.MARISSAHuh, if only.KATRINIf he's alive why would he contact
          me?MARISSAThat depends on whether you believe
          he's innocent, or not.KATRINI'm an old woman with a brokenHEART -MARISSA- What's in the past, stays in the
          past, right?KATRINSomething like that.MARISSASo why all the years of snooping
          around and sticking your nose in?KATRINYou'd understand if you had kids.
          She turns her back on MARISSA.MARISSAKid's, they fuck you up, don't
          they?66.MARISSA stands up, puts a 9mm to the back KATRIN'S head and
          pulls the trigger.
          KATRIN drops to the floor revealing a framed, blood
          splattered, photograph of KATRIN ZADEK'S daughter - JOANNA.131 INT. TENT. SPANISH CAMPSITE. EARLY DAWN. 131HANNA and SOPHIE lie next to each other in sleeping bags with
          a torch between them.SOPHIECan't you sleep?HANNANo.SOPHIEMe neither.
          SOPHIE pauses. Looks at her.SOPHIE (CONT'D)Hanna?HANNAYes?SOPHIEWhere do you really come from?HANNALeipzig, I live in Leipzig -
          SOPHIE looses her patience.SOPHIEIf we're going to be friends you
          have to be honest with me. Them's
          the rules.
          HANNA is taken aback.HANNAAre we friends?SOPHIEYes. I like you.HANNAI'd like to have a friend.SOPHIEI mean you're a freak and
          everything, but I like you.67.HANNAI like you too. I really do. But
          there are things I can't tell you.
          Do you understand?SOPHIEYes... Actually, no, I don't.HANNAThere are people that want to harm
          me. Bad people.SOPHIEI see.HANNAAnd they wont stop.SOPHIERight.HANNASo for your own safety...
          HANNA looks into SOPHIE'S eyes.HANNA (CONT'D)Can we still be friends?SOPHIEI don't know. I mean, I don't
          really know who you are. Do I?HANNAThat's just it. Neither do I.
          She reaches into her bag. Brings out the DNA report. Shows it
          to Sophie. They read. Interfering Sequence. Abnormal.SOPHIEWhat is it?HANNAI think it's about me. DNA is kind
          of how we're made I think. I mean
          who we are.
          They look at it.SOPHIEWhat will you do?HANNAI'm going to Berlin. I have to meet
          my father at the house of Wilhelm
          Grimm.68.SOPHIEAs in “Grimm's Fairytales”?HANNAThat's right.
          SOPHIE sighs at HANNA.SOPHIEIf you say so.HANNADid I say the wrong thing again?
          SOPHIE looks at HANNA, sees she's vulnerable. She takes a
          bracelet off her own wrist. Gives it to her.SOPHIEKeep this. To remember me.
          HANNA takes it, puts it on. Moved. Looks at SOPHIE.SOPHIE (CONT'D)It's a friendship bracelet.HANNAThank you.
          HANNA stares at the ceiling, looks over at SOPHIE who's
          starting to sleep. HANNA reaches out and touches her hair.
          Beside them, separated by a thin piece of fabric, we see that
          MILES has woken and has been listening in the darkness.132 INT. KATRIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 132MARISSA is searching the apartment. She's thorough and fast.
          She rips cushions and throws books from their shelves. Her
          actions become progressively more frantic, relishing the
          destruction. She finds more and more photograph's of JOANNA.
          The photographs seem to have a driving effect on her.
          She walks down the hall and opens a door onto a small spare
          bedroom that had been turned into home office. Every
          available wall space is covered in newspaper clippings and
          photographs relating JOANNA'S murder.
          On the floor MARISSA finds a box of old casette tapes. She
          stops to inspect one of the tapes. A label reads: ‘Joanna no.24'.133 INT. DANISH HOSTEL - MORNING. 133ERIK HELLER walks into a small, long-established family hotel
          on a Danish road near the coast.69.He is in the slightly dated suit he wore when he left the
          forest and looks a little dishevelled and odd. A sixtyish
          Danish woman stands behind the counter, scrutinising him.
          They speak in Danish with English subtitles.ERIK (SIGHS, EXHAUSTED)I need a room.RECEPTIONISTYes of course.ERIKI stayed here fifteen years ago. It
          hasn't changed.RECEPTIONISTWe don't much like change here.ERIKNeither do I.RECEPTIONISTName?ERIKOlsson. Peter Olsson.RECEPTIONISTYou have some post.
          She turns and retrieves HANNA'S POSTCARD from the mail rack
          and hands it to him.ERIKThank you.
          ERIK reads: “Mission accomplished”RECEPTIONISTHave you heard about the manhunt?
          A man has killed two coastguards.
          Everybody is being asked to keep an
          eye out.ERIKFor what exactly?RECEPTIONISTI don't know.
          He smiles. She takes a closer look and notices goose fat
          smeared behind his ear.. and blood on a shirt cuff...134 INT. VAN/SPANISH CAMPSITE - MORNING 134The FAMILY have checked out and are leaving the campsite.70.HANNAHow long until you drop me off?RACHELWe should have you there by dinner
          time. From Lille you can get a
          train to Berlin. Leipzig's just a
          few hours further.
          HANNA and SOPHIE exchange a look.135 EXT. RECEPTION. SPANISH CAMPSITE - CONTINUOUS 135The FAMILY van passes through the campsite gates to reveal
          ISAACS coming out of the reception hut.
          He sees the van, recognises it. He sees the kids in the back.
          Bingo. He runs to a black BMW where two of his HENCHMEN are
          waiting for him.ISAACSWake up. It's them.
          He jumps in the passenger seat whilst the driver revs the
          engine.
          The BMW pulls out in front of an oncoming truck narrowly
          avoiding a collision.136 INT. ISAACS' BMW - CONTINUOUS 136ISAACS holds onto the dash.ISAACSKeep your distance.137 INT. DANISH HOSTEL - DAY 137The RECEPTIONIST picks up the phone and dials.RECEPTIONISTIs that the police? Yes, I don't
          want to trouble you but I have a
          new guest you may wish to know
          about.138 EXT. VESTERBROGADE STATION/COPENHAGEN. DAY. 138A commuter train pulls into the vast station. Amongst the
          morning commuters alighting the train is ERIK HELLER. He
          looks furtively around, and tries to blend in with the crowd.71.POV - from a walkway above the station - someone is watching
          HELLER as he tries to conceal himself within the throng. A
          DANISH AGENT, hidden on a metal walkway above the platform.
          On the platform HELLER walks amongst the commuters, past the
          ticket collectors, past another DANISH AGENT posing as a
          commuter - he stops and lingers by him, noting something not
          right.
          He moves off and enters a small bar.
          The second AGENT immediately follows and from the walkway,
          the other rushes downstairs to give chase too.
          HELLER walks through the bar into the toilets, finds a FIRE
          EXIT and walks out through it.139 EXT. GOODS YARD/VESTERBROGADE STATION - DAY 139HELLER finds himself in a goods yard adjoining the train
          station. He walks through the goods yard, then suddenly, and
          apparently for no reason, stops dead, then throws himself
          behind a skip of empty bottles.
          As he does two new men, AMERICAN SPECIAL OPS, run round the
          corner into the goods yard.
          From the fire exit, the DANISH AGENTS EMERGE and after
          signalling to each other, head off to the perimeter.
          The various agents scour the yard. The SPECIAL OPS get closer
          to HELLER's hiding place. HELLER suddenly emerges from his
          hiding place and sticks an elbow in the face of one, a knee
          in the groin of another.
          There's a brief exchange of blows.
          One of the SPECIAL OPS draws his hand gun.
          HELLER produces a knife out of nowhere and launches at the
          man, cutting him on the hand, making him drop his gun.
          He stabs the other in the eye and the man falls to the ground
          squealing.
          HELLER leans in and takes from the man's pocket hisCELLPHONE.HELLER makes a run for it. One of the SPECIAL OPS lets off a
          shot, the bullet clipping HELLER in the leg.
          He falters but limps off behind the towering containers.140 EXT. FRENCH ROAD - DAY 140The FAMILY van is making its way up through France.72.Following in the black BMW, a few cars behind, ISAACS and his
          HENCHMEN are biding their time.141 INT. VAN/FRENCH ROAD - EVENING 141RACHEL is driving, while HANNA rides in the front seat
          keeping her entertained.HANNA...they can live at freezing
          temperatures for up to nine months
          without food. Imagine that, nine
          months.RACHELWhy do you know so much about
          fleas?HANNAI read it in my Encyclopaedia.
          HANNA is looking in the side view mirror. She sees ISAACS BMW
          and frowns, she's seen it before.HANNA (CONT'D)Also, they can jump around 200
          times their own body length, which
          makes them the best jumpers of all
          known animals except for the
          froghopper. Now they can really
          jump.
          RACHEL makes a turn and HANNA checks the side view mirror
          again. Yes, the BMW is still there. HANNA becomes anxious.RACHELEverything all right?HANNAI think so.
          But HANNA'S face betrays her concern.JOANNA (V.O.)Mama, I know you're disappointed in
          me, I know it. I'm so sorry, Mama.
          But I have found maybe a way to
          make it better...142 INT. HOTEL SUITE. COPENHAGEN - NIGHT 142CLOSE ON - a portable casette machine playing one of the
          tapes MARISSA discovered at KATRIN ZADEK'S.73.JOANNA (V.O.)I'm in a program now... a program
          to make babies stronger.
          In an adjoining bathroom MARISSA, in a pair of cotton
          pyjamas, is brushing her teeth. Her lips pulled back in a
          snarl.JOANNA (V.O.)An American program. It's very
          scientific. Important scientific
          work.
          Still brushing MARISSA walks through to the tape machine and
          presses fast forward. Then play -JOANNA (V.O.)Erik says he can get these tapes toYOU -MARISSA(MUTTERS)Bastard.JOANNA (V.O.)- He says I look beautiful. I don't
          feel beautiful...
          MARISSA doesn't care, fast forwards. Play -JOHANNA (V.O.)...I'm not sure if it's true that
          the baby can hear, but at night I
          sing. I hope it hears me.
          MARISSA listens, for some unknown reason to MARISSA this
          catches her imagination.
          The phone rings.MARISSAWhat?RECEPTIONISTFrau Wiegler, this is reception. I
          have one Erik Heller for you.
          MARISSA stops dead.MARISSAPut him on.ERIK (O.S.)You were supposed to be dead.MARISSASo were you.74.143 EXT. PARK. COPENHAGEN - NIGHT 143A phone booth in a city park. ERIK shivering in the cold as
          icy rain falls around him, he's holding the CELLPHONE he
          stole from the dead SPECIAL OPS. HELLER'S leg is bleeding
          profusely.ERIKWell, here we are.MARISSAHow did you know I was here?ERIKI killed one of your men. Got his
          cellphone. You've gotten soft.MARISSA (O.S.)No, I just grew up. The world's
          changed since you died.ERIKYou got kids?144 INT. HOTEL SUITE. COPENHAGEN - CONTINUOUS 144MARISSA stops, taken aback by the question.MARISSANo, I made choices.ERIKHanna's practically yours, you
          know?
          This goes straight to an ache that's been building inMARISSA.MARISSANot interested.
          But she is.ERIKShe's true and good and funny.
          Yeah, she's funny. She's special.
          You should see her.MARISSAI'm looking forward to it.ERIKYou'll have to catch her first.
          The line goes dead. MARISSA puts the phone down and sits
          quietly for a moment. Then presses play again on the tape
          machine.75.JOANNA (V.O.)Was it like this for you, Mama? I
          think I know what the baby looks
          like. I think it's a girl -- I hope
          so.145 EXT. INDUSTRIAL ROAD - NIGHT 145The FAMILY'S van drives - behind ISAACS BMW tails it, lights
          on high beam.JOANNA (V.O.)I wonder who she'll be? I hope
          she's smart. I hope she's a
          stronger person than I am.146 INT. VAN - NIGHT 146HANNA sits beside her in the passenger seat, her anxiety
          growing.
          RACHEL is still at the wheel, watching the bright headlights
          behind.RACHELShit. Shit, shit, shit. I think
          we're lost, Hanna.
          HANNA checks the side view mirror again and sees ISAACS BMW.
          She's knows that whoever is driving that car is after her.
          She looks back and sees SEB, SOPHIE and MILES all comfortably
          asleep. MILES' fingers wrapped around a Transformers toy.RACHEL (CONT'D)I'm going to pull over.HANNANo, don't.RACHELI need to check the map.147 EXT/INT. CAR/CONTAINER PARK - NIGHT 147The van slowly pulls in at the side of the road.
          RACHEL waits for the BMW behind to pass but instead it pulls
          in behind the van.
          On either side of the road is an enormous container park. The
          containers are piled on top of each other like a giant baby's
          building blocks.76.RACHELWhy won't that car pass? He has his
          lights on high beam, I was doing
          everything I could to get out of
          the way...
          SOPHIE wakes up in the back.SOPHIEAre we stopped? I need to pee.RACHELWell, I don't want you going too
          far right now.HANNAI think you should stay where you
          are, Sophie.
          HANNA doesn't take her eyes off the mirror. She can see the
          silhouettes of ISAACS and his MEN. They don't move and
          neither does HANNA. Both are waiting for the other to make
          the first move.RACHELHanna, what's going on. Seb wake
          up.HANNAPlease.SOPHIEThis is creepy. You're creeping me
          out.SEB(GROGGY)Are we in Lille?HANNAI'm sorry. But you really mustn't
          get out of the van.
          HANNA climbs into the back of the van and comes very close toSOPHIE.HANNA (CONT'D)What ever you do, don't follow me.
          Promise not to follow me.SOPHIEI promise.RACHELHanna, tell me what's going on or
          Seb will go over to that car and
          find out.77.SEBLike fuck I will. Everyone stay
          put. Where's my phone?HANNA(TO SOPHIE)Thank you for being my friend.
          HANNA looks back at the BMW. All at once all four of the car
          doors open.
          In a flash, HANNA pulls open the van's side door and bolts
          from the van.RACHELHanna!
          RACHEL sees ISAACS and one of the HENCHMEN chase after HANNA.
          The SECOND HENCHMAN appears at her drivers window aiming his
          gun at her head. RACHEL screams.148 EXT. CONTAINER PARK - NIGHT 148HANNA sprints across hard tarmac heading for the relative
          safety of the container park.
          ISAACS and his HENCHMAN follow at speed.
          HANNA enters a dark gully between two enormous containers.
          ISAACS slips around the other side to block her off. He
          signals to the HENCHMAN to loop around and flank HANNA.
          HANNA moves quietly between the containers, turning this way
          and that.
          ISAACS voice comes echoing through the maze.ISAACS (O.S.)Don't be a silly girl, Hanna. You
          need to come with me now. I know
          where your papa is.
          She listens.CUT TO:ISAACS, his gun in hand, calls out again.ISAACS (CONT'D)He wants to talk to you, Hanna. He
          misses you.CUT TO:The HENCHMAN appears directly behind HANNA. HANNA double-
          kicks him in the chest.78.HANNA pulls herself up the side of the containers and
          scrambles on top of them and runs, jumping between the
          containers when she reaches a gap.
          The HENCHMAN appears having climbed up too.
          A chase ensues. HANNA, followed by the HENCHMAN climbing up
          higher, now four containers high.
          ISAACS follow below.
          HANNA jumps an enormous gap between two containers and right
          over the head of ISAACS.
          HANNA slips and tumbles but catches the edge of one of the
          containers on her way down. She hangs there a moment, then
          pushes herself off the side of the container and manages to
          land on a lower container on the other side.
          HANNA running across the tops of the containers sees the
          HENCHMAN appear at the far edge. She grabs a discarded wrench
          and throws it at the man, catching him in the side of the
          head - a perfect aim - and he tumbles to the ground.
          She descends the containers with nimble leaps and comes to
          the ground.
          She's running now through a maze of tight alleys between the
          containers. She stops at a ‘T' junction, unsure which way to
          go. Suddenly ISAACS appears at the end of one alley, HENCHMAN
          ONE at the end of another, and HENCHMAN TWO at the end of the
          third.
          She's trapped.ISAACS (CONT'D)Just take it easy.
          HANNA makes her decision and runs straight at ISAACS.
          He stretches out his arms in an attempt to catch her.
          She hits him like a bowling ball hitting the last pin and he
          crashes to the ground.
          She rolls and springs to her feet.
          The HENCHMEN follow but HANNA is too quick.149 EXT. SCRAP METAL YARD/CANAL - NIGHT 149HANNA sprints full tilt out of the container park and through
          a scrap metal yard. Either side of her rise mountains of
          waste.
          HANNA reaches the edge of an industrial canal from where the
          scrap metal is unloaded.79.A large industrial barge is passing beneath. HANNA jumps and
          lands on the moving barge. Then quickly takes cover under a
          tarpaulin.150 INT. HOLDING CELLS. DAWN 150Four holding cells in a row, each one holding a member of the

          SEB paces around his cell. RACHEL sits stoically in hers.
          SOPHIE is crying in her cell while MILES is playing with his
          Nintendo in his cell.
          MARISSA walks into SOPHIE'S cell.MARISSAWould you please stop crying?SOPHIEI'm not telling you anything.MARISSAHoney, your friend is in a lot of

          was going?
          Rachel wracks her brains.RACHELShe said she was going home, to

          nice boy?
          She strokes MILES' hair and immediately he starts crying
          loudly.

          peaceful.152 INT. HOLDING CELLS. DAWN 152Now the whole family are reunited in MILES' cell. He sniffs

          progress into Berlin.154 INT/EXT. CAR/STREET - DAY 154MARISSA looks out at a school playground as she waits in the
          back of her car.
          The passenger door next to her opens and ISAACS gets in.ISAACSI've looked through Heller's
          contacts from the 1980's. There's
          no one called Wilhelm.MARISSAWilhelm Grimm wrote fairy-tales. He
          died two hundred years ago.
          MARISSA hands ISAACS a brown envelope containing one of the
          photographs she took from KATRIN'S apartment.
          The photograph shows a happy looking JOANNA and ERIK at a
          busy family amusement park. Between ERIK and JOANNA is a
          clown, his arms around both of them. This we will come to
          understand is KLAUS KNEPFLER. Behind them is a GRIMM'SBROTHERS HOUSE OF FUN.83.ISAACSWhat the hell is this?

          of Berlin.
          People swarm around her but pay her no mind.156 INT. TRAM - DAY 156HANNA is riding a tram to the outskirts of town.157 EXT. ABANDONNED AMUSEMENT PARK - DAY 157HANNA walks beside a wire mesh fence that separates her from
          an abandoned amusement park. Behind her is an enormous steel
          works from which great industrial plumes of steam rise.
          HANNA climbs under the fence and walks through this surreal
          playground long since reclaimed by nature. There are huge
          fibreglass dinosaurs toppled over with heads missing and
          abandoned dinosaur legs. Rising above the park, surrounded by
          a muddy moat, is the big wheel now standing at a vertiginous
          angle. In front of the big wheel is the WILHELM GRIMM HOUSE.
          The house is a Grimm Brothers fairytale theme ‘Fun House'.
          It's windows long since shuttered, vines growing through its
          roof.
          HANNA stands in front of the house in deep anticipation. She
          walks up the small steps that lead to the front door and
          knocks. She waits, heart sinking at the thought of there
          being no-one home. Then, ever so slightly the door opens and
          peering out at her is a man with the sad face of an out of
          work clown.KNEPFLERExcuse me young lady?
          It is the man from the photo, but twenty years older. Small,
          with a wiry intensity.HANNAAre you Wilhelm Grimm?84.KNEPFLERNot exactly, but it'll do for now.
          Come this way.
          He leads her inside.158 INT. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - DAY 158They come inside - it's old and full of hoarded junk,
          antiques, boxes, books, dusty china, lamps, figurines, but
          still functional - an old man's home. He stops to look at
          her.KNEPFLERSo you are Hanna.
          He puts out his hand to shake.KNEPFLER (CONT'D)It's very nice to meet you, Hanna.
          HANNA smiles and shakes his hand, she likes him already.
          KNEPFLER studies her, quietly moved by his memories.KNEPFLER (CONT'D)My real name is Knepfler. Herr
          Knepfler. I'm an old friend of your
          father's. I am a sort of
          “caretaker” here.HANNAWhat happened to it?KNEPFLERNo car park. You need a car park
          these days, otherwise people wont
          come. But somebody has to watch
          over it...HANNAIt's beautiful.KNEPFLERI like it too. Erik used to come
          here a great deal.HANNAHave you heard from him?
          He nods.KNEPFLERYou must wait. He will be here
          soon.
          HANNA stares, not quite believing.85.HANNA stares out the window, thinking all this through.
          KNEPFLER leads HANNA through a reception area and under a
          spider with a human face that straddles a door to a run down
          kitchen.159 INT. KITCHEN. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 159HANNA follows KNEPFLER into the kitchen.KNEPFLERPlease, sit down.
          HANNA sits at the old kitchen table on a wooden bench, while
          KNEPFLER goes to the stove.KNEPFLER (CONT'D)Would you like an egg? They're
          fresh.HANNAPlease.
          HANNA takes an egg, breaks it and swallows it raw.
          KNEPFLER smiles. He gives her a buff envelope. She looks
          inside - some money, a passport, ID cards.KNEPFLERYou'll need a fresh photograph.
          Don't get it wet.
          HANNA looks at the passport with a new name - ANNA-MARIE
          ELKAN. She takes a deep breath, not really comprehending.HANNAI don't really understand.KNEPFLERID. Identity. It tells people who
          you are.
          She stares at the passport with the blank space for her
          photo.KNEPFLER (CONT'D)There is an apartment ready for you
          in the south. Erik will come and
          the car will take you there today.
          You will live there now.HANNADo I have to?KNEPFLERDon't you want to?86.HANNAI don't know. I miss the forest. I
          miss my home.KNEPFLERThat's to be expected. But the city
          is so exciting, don't you think?HANNAI suppose.
          She drinks her water, thinking.HANNA (CONT'D)Did you know my mother?KNEPFLERI did.HANNAWhat was she like?KNEPFLERShe was very gentle, she was very
          funny, very talented - a singer -

          He smiles at her.
          She here's a noise outside and runs to look out the window.
          She sees ISAACS BMW pull up outside the house followed by a
          second car.HANNAIt's him.KNEPFLERQuick.
          KNEPFLER leads HANNA out of the kitchen.160 EXT. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 160The driver of the second car gets out and opens the back door

          from the reception.KNEPFLERUpstairs.
          There's a knock at the door.
          HANNA begins to climb the stairs while KNEPFLER approaches
          the front door.
          There's another knock at the door.162 INT. GRANDMA'S ROOM. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 162HANNA enters a room that's been designed to look like
          Grandma's bedroom from Little Red Riding Hood.
          HANNA hurriedly slides under the bed. Breathing as quietly as
          she can.
          She can hear the sound of ISAAC'S MEN starting to spread
          through the house.KNEPFLER (O.O.V)Listen to me, listen. There is no
          one here. There is nobody up

          meet him.MARISSAWhen?KNEPFLERTomorrow! Tomorrow morning.
          MARISSA lets him go. She turns to ISAACS.MARISSATake him in there. Find out what he

          the door shutting. The sound of footsteps coming into the
          room. HANNA silent under the bed. MARISSA'S GREEN SHOES are
          in sight, nothing else.
          The green shoes come close and HANNA feels the mattress
          compress as MARISSA sits on the bed. She looks at the shoes
          as she hears her call.MARISSALewis. It's Marissa.
          HANNA hears the name. The name of the woman she thought she
          had killed. Her face pale in shock and fear.MARISSA (CONT'D)You got anything? He's coming here.
          I can smell it. Double the men.
          But, Lewis, I want to talk to him.
          HANNA hears MARISSA hang. Another pair of shoes enter the
          room. Male. ISAACS.ISAACSHis name's Klaus Knepfler. He used
          to send Heller's things from Berlin
          before the Communists were kicked
          out of Prague.MARISSAHow much does he know about the
          programme?89.ISAACSEverything. He knew Johanna.MARISSAWhat does he know about the child?ISAACSHe also thinks Erik's the father.MARISSAWell that's good.ISAACSEverybody thinks Erik's her father.
          Erik probably thinks he's her
          father.
          They snigger. HANNA's eyes widen in shock. She can barely
          control her breath.MARISSACrazy bastard. You got a fix on him
          yet?ISAACSLet's see what else Knepfler has to
          offer.
          He leaves her. MARISSA suddenly senses something. Did she
          hear an intake of breath? She turns and quickly looks under
          the bed. No one there. Her imagination maybe.
          MARISSA stands and we see the shoes walk away to the door.
          They reach the door. HANNA, clinging to the bedsprings in mid-
          air, not breathing. The green shoes leave. HANNA breathes.
          Hurriedly she climbs out from under the bed and goes to a
          window.165 EXT. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - DAY 165HANNA lands having jumped from the window.
          She looks around quickly. Then, out of sight from the cars at
          the front of the house, she runs for dear life.166 EXT. BERLIN STREET - DAY 166HANNA walking fast, in total shock and confusion. Who is she?
          She walks head down, determined not to be seen. Not knowing
          where she is going. Her world turned upside down. She sees an
          internet cafe. Ducks into it.90.167 INT. INTERNET CAFE. BERLIN - DAY 167HANNA sits down at a computer. The young OWNER comes up to
          her.OWNERExcuse me. You have to pay first.HANNAHow much?OWNER3 Euros for half an hour.
          She looks at the money that Knepfler gave her. It contains
          Euros. She hands some over to the OWNER.HANNAHow does it work?OWNERYou've never used the internet?HANNANo.
          He smiles in amazement and logs on for her. The owner brings
          up a search engine.OWNERJust type whatever it is you're

          He suddenly stops dead and ducks behind a fallen fibreglass
          dinosaur as he sees two CIA AGENTS sitting in a car outside
          the house.
          HELLER watches for a moment or two.
          Then, keeping low, he makes a painful run towards the house.
          HELLER throws himself against the back wall of the kitchen.
          He breathes heavily for a moment, clutching his wounded leg.
          He turns and rises to look through the kitchen window.
          Inside he sees KNEPFLER, stripped to the waist his body
          bloodied, hanging upside down from a meat hook. He's
          obviously dead.91.HELLER crouches back down against the wall, thinking
          furiously. Then, decision made, he checks sight lines and
          runs back across the Amusement Park away from the house.169 INT. INTERNET CAFE. BERLIN - DAY 169HANNA sits at the computer, looking at the screen breathless
          with tension.
          Phrases from the text leap out at her. “An interfering
          sequence within the DNA” , “intervention to the mother's
          uterus during pregnancy.”
          HANNA stands in shock. She reads again. “Intervention to the
          mother's uterus”
          HANNA deletes the page. Sits in shock. Then writes in her
          mother's name. JOHANNA ZADEK.
          Immediately the article about JOHANNA's death comes up. HANNA
          stares at it. She reads it. No mention of a child. There is
          an address for Johanna Zadek. She came from the Heizinger
          Buildings area in the suburbs of East Berlin. HANNA writes it
          down. Gets up and leaves.170 INT. TAXI. EAST BERLIN SUBURB - DAY 170HANNA sits in the back of a taxi as it takes her into a grim
          concrete jungle of old East German housing projects.
          HANNA looks at the thousands of tiny windows, so many lives
          being lived in unawareness. Is this normality? Is this the
          world she longed to be a part of?171 INT. GRANDMA'S ROOM. WILHELM'S HOUSE. BERLIN - DAY 171MARISSA and ISAACS wait in Grandma's Room. ISAAC's phone

          for “DNA Interfering Sequence”.MARISSAHanna?ISAACSNext they searched the name Johanna
          Zadek.92.MARISSA stops dead. Looks at ISAACS.MARISSAShe's not coming here.172 EXT. KATRIN ZADEK'S APARTMENT BLOCK. EAST BERLIN HOUSING 172PROJECTS - DAYHANNA gets out of the taxi and looks up at an enormous grey
          housing block - the Heizinger building.
          She approaches the entrance and looks on all the buzzers.
          Sees a name scrawled on one - Number 14. Zadek.
          She presses the buzzer. Waits. No answer.
          A GANG OF KURDISH YOUTHS come out the block and HANNA catches
          the door and enters.173 INT. HALL. KATRIN ZADEK'S APARTMENT BLOCK - DAY 173HANNA knocks at the door of number 14, waits, knocks again,
          louder. No reply.
          A door further along opens. Kurdish music pours out. A
          KURDISH WOMAN wrapped in shawls emerges pushing a pram. She's
          followed by her two other CHILDREN.HANNA(In German w/ EnglishSUBTITLES)Excuse me. I'm looking for Joanna
          Zadek's house. Can you help?
          The KURDISH WOMAN wont look HANNA in the eye as she passes.
          She mutters her response.KURDISH WOMAN(In Kurdish w/ EnglishSUBTITLES)I don't speak German.
          HANNA kicks at the door but knows it won't be answered so
          doesn't wait.174 EXT/INT. KATRIN ZADEK'S APARTMENT. EAST BERLIN HOUSING 174PROJECT - DAYHANNA walks round to the back door of the apartment and
          approaches the kitchen window. She peers through.
          On first inspection the kitchen seems undisturbed. Then HANNA
          sees the framed photograph of JOANNA on the wall. Blood
          splattered across the glass.93.HANNA quickly moves to the door, tries to force it. She looks
          around, no-one's coming. With a sharp kick she smashes the
          glass.175 INT. KATRIN ZADEK'S APARTMENT - DAY 175HANNA climbs through the broken glass into the kitchen. The
          air is thick with the buzz of Bluebottle flies.
          HANNA sees the photograph of JOANNA. With some trepidation
          she moves round the kitchen table and sees the body of KATRIN
          ZADEK. The back of KATRIN'S head is blown clean away. The
          flies have laid their eggs in the bloody mess of her brain
          that spreads across the cheap lino floor.
          HANNA steps back and gags.
          She backs out of the kitchen and into the hall. Turns and
          goes through into the lounge.
          The lounge has been over thrown. Cushions ripped, shelving
          pulled down. HANNA stares at the destruction wrought by
          MARISSA'S hunt for information.
          HANNA turns, walks back down the hall and passes a door to a
          tiny second bedroom. She stops and enters.
          The room had been turned into a home office, there are
          newspaper clippings relating to JOANNA'S MURDER and
          photographs of JOANNA herself covering every available wall
          space. A testament to KATRIN'S unremitting search for the
          truth behind her daughters murder.
          HANNA begins to search the room for clues. Anything that will
          help her understand who she is and where she came from.
          Then suddenly she hears a quiet familiar voice.ERIK (V.O.)You won't find anything.
          HANNA turns in shock.ERIKMarissa would have been much too
          careful for that.
          HANNA stares at him. ERIK HELLER.ERIK (CONT'D)Sit down Hanna.HANNAAre you my father?ERIKSit down.94.HANNAAre you my father?ERIKPlease.HANNAAre you?
          Moment of electric silence between them. ERIK does nothing
          but she knows the answer is no.ERIKI was going to tell you.
          HANNA sinks to the floor. Breathing fast.HANNAWhat's wrong with me?
          ERIK flinches slightly.ERIKNothing.HANNAWhere was I born?
          ERIK knows he has to tell the truth.ERIKAt Galinka.HANNAWhat's that?ERIKIt was a secret CIA research
          programme in rural Poland.HANNAWhat kind of research?ERIKChildren.
          HANNA stares at ERIK.ERIK (CONT'D)It was run by Marissa Wiegler. The
          science came from the old East
          Germany. The money from the CIA.
          The intention was to explore
          whether small genetic changes could
          be made to embryos... to improveTHEM95.HANNA CONT'D)Improve?
          ERIK looks at her. She looks so young, so numb, so lost.ERIKReduce capacity for fear. For pity.
          Increase muscle strength. Heighten
          senses. Anything that might make a
          better soldier.
          HANNA looks up, stares at him. It's her he's talking about.HANNAHow did you know about it?
          ERIK's stares right at her.ERIKI worked for it.
          She stares at him. He hands her a piece of paper from his
          pocket.ERIK (CONT'D)This is what you were looking for.
          HANNA reads. It is an invitation to Johanna Zadek to
          participate in the Galinka project. A projected date of
          arrival at the Galinka Centre. A date - 23rd February 1995.
          An agreed fee to be paid to Johanna. Five hundred American
          dollars. An agreement to give up the child and have no legal
          claim over it. The letter is signed by Erik Heller.ERIK (CONT'D)I recruited your mother at an
          abortion clinic in May 1994. She
          was about to terminate an unwanted
          pregnancy. Some boy at a disco.
          HANNA looks at the paper in shock.ERIK (CONT'D)I had recruited twenty women. She
          was the last. She was different.
          Two years later I heard the
          programme was to be terminated. The
          research “disposed of”.HANNADisposed of?ERIKI tried to save all of you. But you
          were the only one I was able to
          rescue.96.HANNA stands in shock. She reaches to the window of the room
          to get some air. She is reeling - faint.ERIK (CONT'D)Hanna listen to me.HANNAKeep away from me.
          ERIK approaches her. With real conviction.ERIKIt worked. You worked.HANNAYou mean I'm a killer?ERIKNo... no..
          He makes to touch her. HANNA springs back in violent
          repulsion.HANNADon't touch me.ERIKWe have a new identity for you. A
          new life. A new beginning.
          She stares at him, then pushes past him. ERIK stops, pushes
          her back but then HANNA grabs a sharp letter opener.ERIK (CONT'D)Don't.
          She attacks, ERIK pushes her to one side, grabs her. A fight
          in the apartment. Chaos, photos of Johanna crashing, lamps
          and bookshelves falling. HANNA murderous, ERIK just defending
          himself, not willing to hurt her. But then she overpowers
          him, has a knife to his throat.HANNALet me go.
          He releases her. She goes to the door.ERIKI tried to prepare you for what
          your life would be.HANNAYou didn't prepare me for this.
          And her look is so full of pain that in that moment ERIK
          knows he has done a terrible wrong. She starts to leave down
          the fire escape. ERIK calls after her.97.ERIKHanna wait.
          He looks out to watch her go. It's then ERIK sees the cars
          coming across the estate scrubland.
          ERIK turns in panic. And dashes back into the apartment, runs
          through the destroyed living room, and out through the front
          door.176 176DAYERIK comes out of the main entrance and runs into full view
          of the cars, deliberately distracting them from HANNA.177 INT. MARISSA'S CAR. CONT. 177MARISSA's car is a about to turn the corner and bump straight
          into HANNA when suddenly...
          MARISSA sees ERIK leaving the front of the apartment block.
          She speaks to ISAACS.MARISSAThat's him.
          And the car swerves to follow him. Thus moving unknowingly
          away from the slight figure of HANNA. HANNA can see the cars
          in full chase of Erik Heller. He has distracted them.178 EXT. STREET. EAST BERLIN. 178HELLER sprints fast across the wasteland. Incredible
          athleticism. He dives down a side alley, losing his pursuers
          for a second. Takes out a gun, looking for Marissa. Looking
          to finish it off.
          Just as he has done this ISAACS' HENCHMAN approach from the
          end of the street. HELLER fires in their direction, starts to
          run down an alley. He vaults a dividing wall, scratching
          himself on barbed wire. He sprints round a corner and sees a
          doorway ahead of him. He walks towards the doorway.MARISSA (O.C.)Drop it.
          MARISSA steps out of the doorway, her gun trained on him.
          There are men at the end of the alleyway. No escape. HELLER
          drops his gun.
          Silence between them. He turns to look her in the eye.98.ERIKSo go ahead.
          She stares at him. Wants to make this as painful as she can
          for him.MARISSAYou know I'll find her.ERIKDon't under estimate what you
          created.MARISSAWhat we created, together.179 EXT. ESTATE BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS 179HANNA is walking fast across the grim grey estate to a main
          road.180 EXT. STREET. EAST BERLIN - CONTINUOUS 180MARISSA with her gun still at ERIK.MARISSATruth is I was always very fond of
          you.181 EXT. ESTATE BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS 181CLOSE ON - HANNA continuing to walk away.
          She hears a single gun shot. Stops dead. Knows what it means.
          An intense conflict of emotions inside her. Her breathing
          stops for a moment, her world seems to go silent.
          Then a car flies by on the main road, almost running her
          over, and she is woken. She sees a bus stop ahead. On auto-
          pilot she runs to it, a bus coming, she beckons. It stops and
          she is on board.182 EXT. WASTELAND. EAST BERLIN. 182MARISSA stands over the dead body of ERIK HELLER.MARISSALeave him here.
          And they all walk away leaving him alone in the East Berlin
          dirt.99.183 INT. BUS, EAST BERLIN. 183HANNA on the bus. Shaking from the shock of his death,
          bloodied slightly from the fight. The other passengers stare
          at her as she forces back the tears. HANNA reaches in her
          pocket for a handkerchief, but only pulls out the letter Erik
          showed her. The Galinka letter. She sees the address.
          Galinka, Ostrovska district, Poland.
          HANNA makes a decision. She is going back to where she was
          born. She must find out who she is.184 INT. ESTATE BUILDING. KATRIN ZADEK'S FLAT. 184MARISSA enters the apartment. And looks at the chaos. ISAACS
          comes up behind her. HENCHMEN at the door.ISAACSThey had a fight.MARISSAShe must know the truth.ISAACSWhere do you think she's gone?MARISSAWhere would you go?
          MARISSA turns to ISAACS.MARISSA (CONT'D)I'm closing the CIA operation down.
          Heller is dead, that's all that
          matters to them. This we do alone.185 INT. POLISH TRAIN. 185HANNA's head rests on the backrest of a train-seat as the
          train crawls through the Polish/German border. Exhausted,
          many nights without sleep. Hungry but unable to eat. Needing
          resolution.
          In the same carriage a Polish woman sleeps alongside her
          child of two, also sleeping. HANNA looks at the child. The
          peace of the innocent.186 EXT. POLISH TRAIN STATION. NIGHT. 186The train entering a Polish train station. The town is called
          Ostrovska. Freezing cold. The town is in the North of Poland
          and it's very poor. Industrial. Bleak. HANNA exits,
          approaches a station guard.100.HANNAI am looking for a train to
          Galinka.GUARDGalinka is a small village. No
          trains. You must wait for bus in
          the morning.HANNAWhere can I stay?
          He points. HANNA sees the hotel.187 INT. POLISH HOTEL. BEDROOM. NIGHT. 187HANNA enters the tiny, dank hotel room. She looks at the
          filthy carpet, the grey ceiling. She turns on the tiny TV.
          Cartoons. Tom and Jerry type stuff. But she doesn't laugh.
          She flicks channel. Then stands dead still. She is looking at
          ERIK HELLER's dead body on the ground. The report depicts him
          as a dangerous criminal. HANNA stares at the image. The death
          of the man she spent her life with. Lost forever. HANNA's
          face oddly still in the TV flicker. Then she flicks it off.
          Leaves the room.188 INT. POLISH HOTEL. FOYER/BAR - NIGHT. 188HANNA, exhausted, sleepless and starving, comes down the
          shabby hotel stairs and enters the hotel bar. Grim. Empty
          room, old carpet, bad smell, dated pop music. Three hard-
          drinking men stare at her, making her uncomfortable as she
          goes to the bar. A forty-five year old BUSINESSMAN stands
          there, drinking.HANNADo you have a sandwich?BARMANKitchen is closed.
          The BUSINESSMAN speaks in German.BUSINESSMANGet her something. Poor girl's
          hungry.
          The barman disappears. HANNA looks round, waits.BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)I'm from Leipzig.
          HANNA flinches at the name. Leipzig.BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)You?101.HANNAThe same.BUSINESSMANBusiness?
          He looks at her body. HANNA senses it. Her sandwich arrives.
          It's grim. She leaves it, walks out.BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)Where are you going?HANNAI am tired. I need to sleep.
          She leaves the bar. HANNA walks back up the stairs.
          BUSINESSMAN follows.BUSINESSMANHello?
          She walks along the corridor, gets to her room. BUSINESSMAN
          follows.BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)I was just making nice
          conversation. Yes?
          As she enters her room, he puts his foot in the door.BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)Let's talk. Maybe we can do
          business.
          HANNA kicks his foot out of the door. Hard.BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)You don't like talk, huh?
          He barges into the room and grabs her. Tries to push her on
          to the bed. He is strong. His words and tone contrasting
          violently with his actions.BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)Be nice. Be a nice little dolly.
          HANNA is thrust on to the bed, but suddenly turns him over
          her head and smashes him against a cupboard. BUSINESSMAN
          grabs her hair and throws her on the bed.
          But now HANNA snaps. She starts to roar. It's like an animal,
          like nothing we have seen before. She rips at his face, grabs
          a glass, smashes it and cuts his face with it. Pure animal
          rage. BUSINESSMAN starts to scream, blood pouring from his
          eyes. He collapses on the floor. She kicks him, punches him,
          repeatedly in a grief-fuelled rage until she is spent of her
          primal fury and falls, panting, to the floor.102.When she looks up she sees his mangled bloody body lying next
          to her. Not quite dead.
          HANNA suddenly recoils in horror. Shocked by the viciousness
          of her actions.
          Tears begins to run down her cheeks as HANNA grabs the man's
          wallet, and leaves the room.189 EXT. POLISH STREET - NIGHT 189Shaking in shock, HANNAH walks out of the hotel and down the
          street, in a daze, no idea where she is going. She starts to
          run, faster and faster, just running to run out of herself.
          Finally she stops and is sick. She looks up. A taxi's yellow
          light blinks in the darkness. She looks at the businessman's
          wallet to see how much money is in there. She approaches the
          taxi.HANNAI have this much. Can you take me
          to Galinka?190 EXT. POLISH HILL ROAD - NIGHT 190HANNA is in the taxi as it travels a lonely Polish forest
          road through undulating snow-covered hills. Cold dawn is
          arriving. Grey skies lightening through the windscreen. Tall
          snowy pines tower above the car. No one else on the road,
          just a horse drawn cart guiding cows to pasture. It is as if
          from a different age. Quiet, solitary. HANNA checks the
          paper in her pocket. Still there. Blood on her hands from the
          businessman. A cut in her arm. Carefully, secretly, she wipes
          it clean.
          Suddenly the taxi stops.DRIVERThis is as far as the money gets
          you.
          HANNA looks out. Middle of nowhere.HANNAHow much further?DRIVERTwelve miles.HANNAPlease.
          But no smile from him, nothing. HANNA gets out. Starts to
          walk as the taxi turns and drives back the way it came.103.She is alone in the forest, freezing, shattered, hungry. Just
          about dawn. Cold as hell.
          She hears a car approach. Tries to hail it but it flies past
          fast. Blows icy air in her face.
          She continues in the freezing cold - sees the road ahead.
          It's hilly, winding, she isn't going to make it. Too tired.
          Too shattered.
          Time passes. Still she walks. Dead on her feet. Gathering
          every ounce of energy.
          Then the sounds of another car. But it too just flies by,
          ignoring her waves and cries.
          HANNA almost collapses in frustration. But carries on.
          Carries on walking.
          Time passes. Freezing cold. HANNA alone on the road. Can she
          make it?
          Then another car. HANNA turns, waves, cries out. And, almost
          magically, the car slows and stops. The window winds down.HANNA (CONT'D)I'm going to Galinka. Can you help
          me?
          A woman's voice, German, in German.WOMAN (V.O.)Yes I can take you there.
          And as HANNA gets in, she looks at the comforting, smiling
          face of MARISSA WIEGLER.191 INT. CAR. POLAND. ROAD TO GALINKA - NIGHT 191MARISSA starts to drive, HANNA sits in the front with her.
          HANNA has no idea who she is.
          MARISSA speaks in perfect German. Calm, soft, comforting.MARISSAIt's a very dull place Galinka. Why
          would you want to go there?HANNAI was born there. But I've never
          really seen it. Why are you going?MARISSAI have some business to sort out.
          She looks at her and smiles a sunny, uncomplicated smile.104.MARISSA (CONT'D)It's very lucky we ran into each
          other, don't you think?HANNAYes...MARISSAYou've hurt your arm.HANNAIt's okay.
          MARISSA hands her some tissue. HANNA bandages the arm.MARISSAI'm Astrid.HANNAYou're not German. Are you
          American?MARISSAThat's right. I lived there for
          many years. I travel a lot.
          MARISSA smiles at her kindly. HANNA feels safe for the first
          time in ages. She feels the tears come.MARISSA (CONT'D)Oh dear, what's wrong with you?HANNASorry.MARISSAIt's okay. Are you in trouble?
          HANNA nods. She fights the tears.
          MARISSA gently holds her hand as she drives. HANNA weeping.MARISSA (CONT'D)What sort of trouble?HANNA(though her tears)
          I don't know what to do. Nothing is
          what I thought it would be. It's...
          ugly and cruel and I don't know
          where to go, or... I'm stupid. I
          don't know what I expected...
          MARISSA secretly, genuinely affected by this. Fights the
          emotion that has surprised her. Human warmth.MARISSASometimes I feel the same way.105.HANNA eyes her, surprised to hear this from a grown up woman.
          MARISSA puts on some music. Gentle. Bach maybe.HANNAI like music.MARISSASleep why don't you? You look very
          tired. It will take half an hour on
          this road.
          HANNA nods. She begins to drift off, so long since she has
          slept. Her eyes fall shut and her head rests against the
          window. She is asleep. Vulnerable.192 EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAWN 192Soft dawn light as MARISSA drives on a narrow rural road.193 INT. CAR - DAWN 193MARISSA looks at the sleeping HANNA. MARISSA represses her
          gathering emotion. HANNA suddenly looking so young as she
          sleeps the sleep of the innocent. The rush of emotion shocks
          her - she is watching HANNA, not the road - and she veers
          off, nearly crashing the car, narrowly avoiding a tree. She
          puts her foot sharply on the brake. She's wearing the same
          GREEN SHOES as she wore at Wilhelm's House.
          HANNA is jolted awake.HANNAWhere are we?
          MARISSA calms herself instantly.MARISSANearly there.
          HANNA doesn't see MARISSA'S SHOES.194 EXT. GALINKA 194MARISSA's car slows as it enters a tiny deserted hamlet.MARISSA (V.O.)This is it.195 INT. MARISSA'S CAR. 195HANNA looks around. There is not much to Galinka. She is
          confused.106.HANNAIt's so small.MARISSAYes. Just a few cottages. And the
          old bunker.
          HANNA chooses not to ask any more questions.HANNAThank you for the ride. You're very
          kind.MARISSAI wish there was more I could do
          for you.
          MARISSA looks kindly at HANNA who is confused by the
          intimacy. MARISSA reaches into the glove compartment and
          retrieves a torch which she hands to HANNA.MARISSA (CONT'D)Here, take this.
          HANNA switches the torch on and off, thinking.MARISSA (CONT'D)I hope you find what you're looking
          for.HANNAThank you.
          She gets out and shuts the door behind her.196 EXT. GALINKA. CONT. 196HANNA looks around at the grey desolation, rural poverty, the
          ends of the earth. In the car MARISSA stares at her, then
          drives off.
          HANNA walks through the trees along a track. Overgrown, not
          used for many years.
          She reaches a hidden entrance off the track. By the entrance
          there is an old battered sign. GALINKA. HANNA looks at the
          old iron gate. Rusted, locked. It has not been opened in a
          long time.
          She stares at the sign, tries the gate - yes, locked. Then
          she climbs the gate. She nearly tears her clothes on the
          spikes at the top of the gate, then leaps over and,
          exhausted, four days without real sleep, begins to walk up
          the narrow tree-lined driveway.107.197 EXT. GALINKA BUNKER - CONTINUOUS 197HANNA approaches the gaping mouth of an underground bunker.
          She stops, looks down at the torch in her hand, switches it
          on and walks into the darkness.198 INT. TUNNELS. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 198With only the torch light to see by HANNA treads warily
          deeper into the tunnels as, behind her, the small aperture of
          daylight recedes slowly to nothing.
          The tunnels seem to stretch on for miles ahead of her.
          HANNA reaches a junction where four tunnels meet. She shines
          her torch down each tunnel, trying to decide which way to go.
          She stops when she sees, a little way down one of the
          tunnels, a child's forgotten shoe.
          HANNA steps forward and shines her torch down at the tiny red
          shoe, its buckle rusted.
          She walks on into the dark.
          HANNA finds a door which she pushes at. The door is stiff,
          but HANNA uses her full weight and soon she's made enough of
          a gap to squeeze through.199 INT. NURSERY. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 199At first HANNA has difficulty making out where she is, but
          dotted here and there are parts of an old nursery. The walls
          are painted with a blue sky, clouds and the figures of
          children holding hands.
          She begins to remember as, from a distant place, she hears
          the sound of children laughing. She shines her torch in the
          direction of the laughter and catches a glimpse of a child,
          dressed in a party frock and hat, playing hide and seek. She
          shines her torch the other way, and there's another, then a
          third and a fourth. For a moment the room seems to be filled
          with laughing children.
          Then, in an instant, they're gone again and silence returns.
          HANNA, lit only be the reflected light of her torch, knows
          she has been here before.
          She walks on through the tunnels.200 INT. DORMITORY. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 200HANNA enters a long hall which was once the children's
          dormitory.108.At one end is a steep pile of metal bed frames.
          From a distant place in her memory HANNA begins to hear the
          sound of children singing.CHILDRENHappy Birthday to you,
          Happy Birthday to you...
          From the far end of the dormitory come a procession of
          CHILDREN, the first of whom is carrying a large birthday cake
          lit with birthday candles. The children's faces glow eerily
          in the candle light. They're looking at HANNA and walking
          straight towards her as they sing.CHILDREN (CONT'D)Happy Biirrrrthday, dear...
          The CHILDREN arrive at HANNA lifting the cake towards her.CHILDREN (CONT'D)... Hanna.
          Happy Birthday to you!
          HANNA leans forward, takes a deep breath and blows. The
          children disappear with the flames of the candles.
          The sound of a woman's approaching footsteps echo through the
          tunnel.
          HANNA swings her torch beam in the direction of the
          footsteps. She freezes as she sees a pair of GREEN SHOES
          walking towards her. The same shoes as in Wilhelm's house.MARISSA WIEGLER.HANNA raises her torch beam to see the face of the woman from
          the car.HANNAYou're Marissa Wiegler.
          HANNA starts to shake.
          MARISSA has her gun pointing at HANNA but her expression is
          the same sunny, uncomplicated smile as earlier. Dead silence.
          HANNA breathing fast. MARISSA speaks in English.MARISSADon't worry sweetie. I don't want
          to hurt you.
          MARISSA'S tone has turned into a twisted interpretation of
          maternal care.
          HANNA does not move. Like a wild animal cornered.109.MARISSA (CONT'D)I could have killed you already
          when you were asleep in the car.
          HANNA'S still shaking.
          HANNA now sees ISAACS and his HENCHMEN, three of them, all
          with hunting rifles. All ready to shoot her should she attack
          or run. They are some distance away, not coming any closer.MARISSA (CONT'D)Did Erik tell you about this place?HANNAWhere are the other children?
          She looks at MARISSA, who waits, then answers quietly.MARISSASleeping. They're all sleeping.HANNAI don't believe you.MARISSAI can protect you, Hanna. Make sure
          you walk out of here and keep
          walking. Grow up and grow old in
          safety and security. No one need
          know a thing. But you have to trust
          me. You can't talk about this with
          anyone. It's what we call
          “classified.” If you tell anyone,
          it'll be dangerous for both of us.
          HANNA looks at her, remembering what ERIK told her, trying
          hard not to succumb.HANNAYou killed my mother.MARISSAYou're mother didn't want you,
          sweetie. I saved you.
          HANNA just stares, not believing her.MARISSA (CONT'D)I'm the only person left who
          understands who you are. The only
          one who cares.
          MARISSA holds out a hand to HANNA, for HANNA to take, a
          motherly gesture...MARISSA (CONT'D)I practically am your mother.110.HANNA'S stomach turns in horror. She switches off her torch
          and runs into the shadows.
          ISAACS raises his gun fires.201 INT. TUNNELS. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 201HANNA running through the darkness. Behind her ISAACS and the
          HENCHMEN come after her. ISAACS carries a large heavy torch,
          as does one of the HENCHMEN. The other HENCHMEN all have
          night vision on their rifles.
          HANNA crouches down, she sniffs the air, can smell them
          coming.
          A HENCHMAN treads carefully down the tunnel. We see his point
          of view through his night vision sight, just the dark tunnel
          stretching on.
          Like a ghost HANNA'S face appears up close, her eyes a pearly
          white.
          She slams the gun back in the HENCHMAN'S face.
          Still in night vision we see the fight, quick and hard. The
          flash of a single bullet illuminates his death.
          Silence once more.
          HANNA now has the first HENCHMAN'S rifle.
          From around the corner into the next tunnel she hears the
          sound of feet on dirt. She presses herself against the
          tunnel, waits listening, hears the feet again and in one
          movement raises the rifle and spins round the corner.
          Through her night vision sight she sees a deer, scared eyes
          staring back at her.
          She releases her grip on the trigger and the deer scampers
          into the darkness.202 INT. LABORATORY. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 202HANNA comes into the old laboratory. Through her night vision
          sights we see the white tiles and smashed equipment.
          She senses someone coming after her and ducks behind a lab
          bench.
          A HENCHMAN enters the lab carrying a hand gun and a small
          torch. His footsteps make a crunching sound as he steps
          through the broken glass that litters the floor.
          HANNA rises from her hiding place and stands straight into
          the torch light.111.She fires but is off target and only catches the HENCHMAN'S
          left arm.
          He drops his torch which slides across the floor.
          HANNA comes round the lab bench to where the HENCHMAN should
          be lying but he's gone. There's a trail of blood which she
          follows to a metal cabinet.
          She stops at the cabinet and fires three shots into its
          flimsy doors.
          The dead HENCHMAN slides out from the cabinet.
          HANNA takes the dead man's hand gun and goes to retrieve the
          torch.
          She switches the torch off.203 INT. TUNNELS. GALINKA. 203ISAACS, unnerved, presses himself against the wall of the
          tunnel. He feels something at his legs. Points his torch to
          find the deer pulling at his trouser leg. He shoots it. Then
          runs further down into the tunnel.
          Alerted by the sound of ISAACS' shot HANNA starts to pursue
          her prey.204 INT. DORMITORY. GALINKA. 204ISAACS is back in the dormitory. With torch in hand he
          searches under the beds. Behind him he hears HANNA enter. He
          switches off his torch and crawls under a bed.
          HANNA walks slowly between the beds. Under the bed ISAACS is
          preparing to fire, now watching her feet.
          Suddenly the bed he's under is lifted straight up in the air
          and off him - HANNA has summoned enormous strength and is
          clutching the end of the bed. He fires, hits nothing and she
          lets go - the bed comes crashing down on him again.
          His torch rolls away. His arms are trapped under the bed,
          he's unable to move.
          With all his might ISAACS pushes at the bed and lifts it off
          himself.
          They fight.
          HANNA picks up the torch and slams the torch across his
          temple. She grabs him by the hair and smashes his head
          repeatedly into the floor - BAM - BAM - BAM - BAM - BAM.
          Silence - he's dead.112.HANNA sits back on the bed and looks at her bloodied hands -
          looks down at what she's done. Shocked by her own violence
          she begins to cry hot tears of bewilderment.
          She gets up and runs from the dormitory.205 INT/EXT. TUNNELS/TUNNEL MOUTH. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 205HANNA runs back through the tunnels.HANNANo more. No more.
          Tears are streaming down her face as she reaches sight of the
          tunnel mouth and the daylight beyond. Standing in silhouette
          is MARISSA. HANNA slows her pace and stops when she can see
          the white of MARISSA'S eyes and the finger on MARISSA'S
          trigger.
          MARISSA raises the gun and aims at HANNA - but HANNA comes
          forward again, walking calmly towards her.
          She stops and drops her gun to the ground.HANNA (CONT'D)Everything I see is nothing I want.
          MARISSA looks at HANNA, her gentle, childlike countenance.
          She smiles.MARISSALet me take care of you?HANNANo. I don't want that.
          HANNA turns her back on MARISSA and starts to walks in the
          opposite direction.
          MARISSA watches her walk away.
          HANNA walks waiting for the shot to come.MARISSAHanna.
          HANNA spins, fires directly at CAMERA.CUT TO BLACK.206 EXT. FOREST. NORTH SWEDEN. 206FADE UP:The sun spreads its golden fingers through the trees catching
          the early morning dew.113.A wide shot of the HANNA'S cabin, wisps of smoke rise from
          it's chimney.
          HANNA steps out of the cabin. She's back wearing her furs
          again. In her hands she carries a cup of hot milk and a small
          wooden bowl.
          In VOICE-OVER we hear HANNA reading from her beloved
          Encyclopaedia.HANNA (V.O.)The Earth is the third planet from
          the Sun, and the fifth-largest of
          the eight planets in the Solar
          System.
          HANNA sits down on a tree trunk outside the cabin and pours
          some milk into the bowl, then drinks a little for herself.HANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)Home to millions of species,
          including humans, Earth is the only
          place in the universe where life is
          known to exist.
          She raises her head and makes a small clicking sound. Her
          friend, the snow fox, appears from the trees. The fox now has
          a small family of cubs.
          HANNA watches as the cubs approach the milk and begin to
          drink.HANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)The planet formed over four and a
          half billion years ago, and life
          appeared on its surface within a

          HANNA sits back and feels the sunlight on her face. Above her
          the trees are beginning to leaf.HANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)It is expected to continue
          supporting life for another one and

          HANNA surveys her beautiful world.THE END
