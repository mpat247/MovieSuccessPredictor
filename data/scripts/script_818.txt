                 neighborhood bully; you suppose to live
                 happily ever after.  But around here;
                 that's when all the drama begins...

       Blue and red police lights flash over Debo's body.  Two
       sheriffs walk INTO OUR FRAME and stand over Debo.  They flash
       their lights on him.

                 Last Friday; I got fired for the first
                 time.  I got high for the first time.  I
                 got shot at for the first time and I
                 kicked Debo's ass for the first time...

       They get him to his feet; but he stumbles and falls in the
       bushes like a knocked out prize fighter.  The sheriffs laugh
       at him.

       Debo looks dazed and confused.  The sheriffs help him out the
       bushes and start to cuff him.

                 I was the man that night; and Debo ended
                 up going to jail for a couple of years.
                 But he told Ezal he was getting out next
                 Friday.  He said, when he see me, he was
                 gonna smoke me on the spot...

       over the LA skyline.  As the city starts to awake and the
       credits continue to roll;
       we see SEVERAL SHOTS of the real people who make up Los
       Angeles.  It seems that they all move to the same beat.EXT. L.A. COUNTY JAIL - CONTINUOUSDebo is released from the Twin Towers County Jail.  Still in
       his orange jumpsuit, he walks right past us and down the
       street.  Everybody clears his path.

       SOUNDTRACK still PUMPIN'.

       Debo crosses the street passing an old man dancing and
       directing traffic.  Debo stops, the man starts to dance in
       front of him.  He stares for a second, then he's on his way.

       Still walking tall and hard, he trips over a crack in the
       sidewalk (losing cool points).

       Three little black girls in plaid uniforms practice the
       latest dance steps on their way to school.  Debo is walking
       towards them.  They scream and take off in the other
       direction.  He smiles.  Briefly.

       Still walking; he stops at a corner.  A SA boy waits to cross
       with his low-rider bike.  A Metrolink train passes.  After it
       goes by; we see Debo riding off on the boy's bike.  He's on
       the ground holding his eye.

       Debo continues to ride through the city.

       He turns a corner or two and comes to a stop at Craig's
       house.EXT. JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUSMr. Jones' dog catcher's truck sits in front of the house.

       A CHIHUAHUA (like the Taco Bell dog) takes a dump on the
       lawn.  It starts to BARK at Debo.  He looks down at the dog
       and kicks him in the street.  The DOG YIPES!

       Debo focuses his attention on Craig's house.INT. JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUSThe hallway is clear and quiet, until MR. JONES (Craig's
       father), storms out of the bedroom.  He struggles to put on
       his dog catcher's uniform.  He stops at the bathroom door and
       knocks hard.MR. JONESCraig!  Craig!  Off yo' ass and on yo'
                 feet; this ain't the time to beat your
                 meat!

                 to Ezal, he wanted me to move with my
                 uncle and little cousin in Rancho
                 Cucamonga.  Til' things calm down, or
                 Debo went back to prison.  Whichever
                 comes first.

       He's sitting on the toilet (dressed: not using it) putting
       the finishing touches on his masterpiece.  He licks, rolls
       and slides the 'J into the fifth pocket on his Levi jeans.

                           CRAIG (cont'd) (V.O.)
                 I feel like the biggest punk around here.
                 I wiped Debo's ass.  He should be the one
                 moving.

       He exits.EXT. JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUSThe front door opens.  Mr. Jones walks out the door, yelling
       back into the house.MR. JONESCraig!  Let's go!  I don't wanna hit that
                 traffic.

       He steps off the porch backwards and into "fresh Chihuahua
       shit."  He slips and falls on the grass.

       Mr. Jones gets up.  He brushes the grass off his uniform.  He
       looks clean, but when he turns around dog shit is smashed all
       over his back and butt.

       Debo reaches for his shank.  Craig turns to Mr. Jones!CRAIGDaddy, punch it!

       Mr. Jones floors it and hits Debo.  He falls over the hood,
       off the car and in the street.  The yellow truck speeds off.
