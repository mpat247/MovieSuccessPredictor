                                      Jessie Nelson2001SHOOTING DRAFTINT. STARBUCKS - 7:30 A.M.We're watching a pair of hands arrange white sugar packets,
            blue Equal packets, and pink Sweet and Low into small
            containers.  With precision and lightning speed, the mixed up
            colors and crumpled packets are transformed into neat little
            color-coded rows.  Wait, this container has three Equals and
            four Sweet 'n' lows.  The hand quickly plucks the mutant
            Sweet 'n' Low.  There.  Symmetry.

            We move up those hands and meet SAM DAWSON as he surveys his
            domain.  Something about him.  He's extremely compelling,
            uniquely handsome.  But it's more than that.  Those eyes,
            they sparkle with the wonder of a child.  Life's cynical edge
            has not etched it's path across this face.  They light on a
            COFFEE CUP held by one of the Regulars.SAMDouble double decaf low-fat Cap.BRUCEYou got it, buddy.SAMGood choice very good choice.

            Sam moves along, commenting to CUSTOMERS as he places Sweet
            'n Lows on tables, the self-appointed host of Starbucks.SAM (CONT'D)Mocha rumba Frappuccino no whipped, half
                      low, half non.  Excellent choice.  Very
                      good choice.

            He stops in front of sale mugs and turns them so that the
            logos all face the same way.  His boss GEORGE approaches.GEORGESam, they called.  It's time for you to
                      go.

            Sam FREEZES, but doesn't turn around.GEORGE (CONT'D)Sam, did you hear me?SAM"It's time for you to go."GEORGEYes.SAMIt's time.GEORGEGood luck.

            Without another word, Sam walks straight out the door.EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - DAYSam, still in his white apron, walks down the busy street. 
            He has a fast, loping gait that doesn't slow or hesitate for
            anyone. A COUPLE argue on the sidewalk.  Sam WALKS RIGHTBETWEEN THEM.SAMIt's time.  It's time.

            Sam keeps moving, he crosses the street without stopping.

            Sam pushes the DOOR OPEN.  And we REALIZE we are entering: AHOSPITAL LABOR DELIVERY ROOM AT LA COUNTY HOSPITAL.REBECCA is in the middle of a major contraction.  Her face is
            the opposite of Sam's.  Hardened.  She lets out a scream that
            stops Sam dead in his tracks.  GERTIE, a no-nonsense Black
            Nurse, looks up from the monitor.GERTIEYou the one responsible for this?

            Sam nods, taking Gertie quite literally.SAMI'm sorry.GERTIEToo late for sorries, daddy, get over
                      here and hold her hand.

            Sam reaches for Rebecca's hand.  She pulls it away.  ANOTHER
            CONTRACTION - Rebecca screams.  Sam SCREAMS.NURSEYou got a live one, Gert.INT. LABOR ROOM - LATERDR. JAMISONOkay, this is it!SAM(spins in circles)

            The BABY lets out her first cry.  Sam watches, awestruck. 
            Gertie wraps the baby in a blanket and holds her out to
            Rebecca.  Rebecca shakes her head - NOT NOW.  Gertie walks
            over to Sam.GERTIEThere's someone who's been waitin' an
                      awful long time to see you, Sam.

            She places the BABY into SAM'S ARMS.  Suddenly Sam's whole
            body RELAXES and becomes very still.  He looks to Rebecca,
            but she has turned away.  He meets Gertie's eyes.  Then in
            quiet amazement:SAMThis is it.GERTIEWhat's her name?SAM(looks at clock)

            We hear LIKE A LULLABY, "Picture yourself on a boat in a
            river with tangerine trees and marmalade skies..."EXT. HOSPITAL - NEXT MORNINGSam, holding the baby, and Becca, having just checked out,
            walk down the steps of the hospital holding their
            complimentary plastic baby bag.  Sam is nervous haling the
            precious cargo and Becca is agitated.  They see the bus
            pulling up and down the street and Sam moves quickly so they
            can hurry and catch it.  As he approaches the bus, he looks
            to Becca by his side, but she is not there.  He looks around
            and no sign of her. 
            Frantically turning in a full circle, he sees the fabric of
            her dress disappearing into the crowd down the street.  He
            screams.SAMBecca!  Becca!

            The more he screams the faster she moves away.  Till there's
            no trace of her.  Sam stands in the middle of the busy block
            holding Lucy to his chest, devastated.

            We hear, "Look for the girl with the clouds in her eyes, but
            she's gone."SMASH CUT TO:INT. BUS - NIGHTSam holds the now sleeping baby to his chest.  Next to him is
            the plastic bag from the hospital containing diapers, two
            cans of formula and a half empty bottle of milk.  Sam is
            surrounded by PASSENGERS, the eerie world of the underground
            at night.  Instinctively, Sam holds her even tighter, two
            against the world.INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DAWNA marvel of organization.  A closet reveals clothes on
            hangers exactly equidistant from each other; precisely folded
            T-shirts, underwear and socks organized by color.  A
            carefully systemized record collection fills makeshift
            bookshelves.

            Beatles posters from every era decorate the walls.  Becca's
            things sit in one corner.  An island of chaos in an "Hold
            Everything" showroom.  The kitchen counter has been
            transformed into a changing table.  Bottles and pacifiers
            lined up next to a stack of cloth diapers.  Underneath, a
            clothes line of baby clothes.

            The sound of a CRYING BABY breaks the silence.  The camera
            follows and finds the CRADLE: a DRAWER tucked snugly into a
            blanket hanging like a hammock between two chairs.  An
            exhausted SAM POPS up from his bed, behind the hammock.  He
            swings the hammock, hoping against hope the baby will go back
            to sleep.SAMDidn't you just fall asleep, little
                      girl?
                          (Lucy cries harder)
                      Okay, if you say it's time to get up,
                      then it's time to get up, time to get
                      up.
                          (Sam sniffs the air)
                      Oh my, oh my, oh my.  Quite a bit of
                      business.

            He rushes over to the kitchen counter and unsnaps the baby's
            pajamas, revealing a cloth diaper held together with
            promotional buttons: one says "Hertz, #1 for Car Rentals",
            the other a picture of Magic Johnson and reads "Go, Lakers,
            Go!"  Sam undoes it.SAM (CONT'D)Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.  Let me
                      see let me see let me see.

            Sam attempts to clean and diaper her.  He finally manages to
            pin the buttons so that it at least stays on.SAM (CONT'D)You look very beautiful this morning,
                      very beautiful.

            He holds her up, and the diaper falls down around her ankles.CUT TO:We pan across a row of diapers on a supermarket shelf:HUGGIES, PAMPERS, EXTRA ABSORBENT PAMPERS, LUVS...INT. WALMART - DAYSam stares at the "Great Wall of Diapers", awed.  He reaches
            for the Pampers, balancing Lucy, then the Luvs, no, the
            Huggies.  Sam stops moving, Lucy starts CRYING, so he jogs in
            place.  Sam decides on one of each.  He heads to the FORMULA

            cradle as if she were a bomb that might detonate. 
            He tiptoes, his FIST raised victoriously - "YES!"  He doesn't
            get two steps before Lucy wakes screaming.  Defeated, he
            picks her up.  HELP.  The PHONE RINGS.  HE PRESSES speaker.RASPY WOMAN (O.S.)What the hell are you doing to that

            He looks out his window and sees ANNIE CASSELL, his neighbor
            on the phone, watching him through her window.  She is a
            strange creature with very thick glasses.  We sense a
            uniquely profound intelligence behind all that armor.SAMEverything's so tiny, tiny.  Tiny.

            purposely down the walkway - his houseslippers scuffling on
            the quiet street.SERIES OF SHOTS AT 3:00 A.M. --EXT. STREET - NIGHTLucy in her pj's walks down the middle of the street.EXT. SAM'S WINDOW - NIGHTLucy knocks on Sam's window.EXT.

STREET - NIGHTLucy in a blanket being carried by Sam toward Randy's house.INT. LUCY'S ROOM - NIGHTUntil FINALLY, we see Lucy in her hammock at Randy's house
            looking out the windows, which have now been completely
            covered with BARS.  Her room is filled with origami birds
            from the 100 Denny's napkins, her birthday gift.  Lucy gets
            out of her hammock and tiptoes across her room - quietly
            opening the door.INT. CARPENTER HOUSE - STAIRS TO LIVING ROOM - NIGHTWe follow her through the dark house as she creeps down the
            stairs.  She gets to the front door.  It's been DEAD BOLTED
            where she cannot reach it.  From the darkness we hear --RANDY(tenderly)
                      Lucy.  Come here.

            Randy sits in the darkness, next to a THIRD OF A GLASS OF
            MILK and a HALF A DENNY'S BLUEBERRY MUFFIN.RANDY (CONT'D)I made us a midnight snack.

            Lucy stares at the muffin and milk.  Torn.RANDY (CONT'D)I understand that you want to see your
                      daddy.  And I don't want to keep you
                      from him.  I honestly don't.  So you
                      tell me when you want to see him.  You
                      can see him anytime you want.  But we
                      have to arrange it first.  Do you
                      understand?
                          (Lucy nods)
                      Now would you like a snack?

            Lucy nods.  Elated, Randy makes room for her on the couch. 
            But Lucy just reaches for the milk and muffin and heads up
            the stairs then turns back and speaks gently to Randy.LUCYThank you.  Goodnight.RANDY(words caught in her throat)
                      Goodnight, Lucy.INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - DAYWe PAN ACROSS THE ROOM and see Sam's shoes, his tie, and aYELLOW PAD WITH ALL THE PRESIDENTS LISTED IN ORDER.  A KNOCKat the door - Sam opens it to see Rita standing there,
            looking intensely vulnerable, holding her husband's suit.RITAMy husband left this when he moved out.SAMOh, lovely Rita, meter maid.RITA(entering)
                      Nice place.  I worry.  I worry
                      sometimes...SAMYou worry you did the wrong thing?RITAI worry that I've gotten more out of
                      this relationship than you.SAMNo no no.  I'm the lucky one.  I have
                      the lawyer that never loses.RITA(covering)
                      That's me...okay, let me see, let me
                      see, let me see.
                          (pulls out notes)
                      They're going to put Bill and Randy on
                      the stand first and then you.SAMThem first, then me.  They're a nice
                      couple.  They have a nice house.  She's
                      pretty.  She's smart, too.  I can tell. 
                      The manager of the salad bar is gonna
                      testify, isn't he?  That will help us.

            For a moment, Rita's mask drops and her fear for Sam
            overwhelms her.RITAAbsolutely.SAMNobody believed that George Harrison
                      could really be a song writer.  But he
                      wrote "Here Comes the Sun".  John and
                      Paul said it was one of the best songs
                      on ABBEY ROAD.RITA(tenderly)
                      George was always my favorite Beatle.SAMLucy's was Paul.INT. RANDY AND BILL'S BEDROOM - 2 A.M.Randy and Bill are asleep when Randy senses something.  She
            opens her eyes and sees Lucy staring at her.LUCYNow.RANDYWhat honey?LUCYNow.  I want to see him now.INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - 3:30 A.M.We see Sam sleeping in bed.  There's a KNOCK at the door. 
            Sam wakes with a start, throws down the covers. 
            We see that he's wearing the Armani suit.  Sam opens the door
            to see Randy standing there, holding a sleeping Lucy in her
            arms.RANDYShe fell asleep on the car ride over.  I
                      was gonna turn back and tuck her in to
                      her bed...with the pink canopy...and the
                      quilt I made...But I was afraid she'd
                      wake up at our house...
                          (fighting the ache in her soul)
                      ...and want to come home.

            Sam looks at Randy with profound compassion.RANDY (CONT'D)I was gonna tell the judge that I could
                      give Lucy the kind of love she never
                      had.  But I would be lying.SAMI hope I hope I hope that you're saying
                      what I think you're saying even though
                      you're not saying it.

            Randy nods and hands the sleeping Lucy into Sam's strong
            arms.  For a moment they BOTH HOLD LUCY between them in the
            most unique embrace.  Randy finally lets go and struggles to
            say goodbye.RANDYGoodnight.  I'll see you in court.  Save
                      me a seat...on your side.

            Randy walks away.  Stunned, Sam watches her, holding Lucy in
            his arms.  Then, from a very brave place:SAMRandy!  If I tell you I can't do it
                      alone, will you tell the judge?RANDY(turns gently)
                      No.SAMPromise?RANDYPromise...SAMI've looked and looked for a mother for
                      Lucy.

                      anyone.  You're the red in Lucy's

            a fierce game.  A foul is called when we hear -SAMPenalty!  Rules broken.  Penalty,
                      please!

            Sam, wearing a UNIFORM and whistle around his neck, walking
            his inimitable walk, races up the field, COACHING THE TEAM.

            Ifty, Robert and Brad sit in the bleachers.  Robert, in
            sunglasses, paranoid, looking behind him.  Brad follows
            around an attractive YOUNG WOMAN as close as he can get to
            her.  Sam runs by the water stand, manned by Randy and Bill.  

            They share a look - a moment of intense parental pride.  Lucy
            and a kid named PHILLIP go after the ball.OBNOXIOUS MOMGet her!  Phillip, you get her!ROBERTI saw that!  You gave him a secret
                      signal!  Didn't you?IFTYKeep both eyes on the ball, Lucy - balls
                      are round - on sale at Kmart.  The earth
                      is a ball, too...

            Phillip steps in front of Lucy and shoves her as hard as he
            can.  Sam blows his whistle repeatedly and races over.SAMPenalty!  Repeat!  Rules broken!

            and referee hand signal from every sport known to man.  It
            looks like a bizarre TWYLA THARP DANCE.ON LUCYShe does it right back at him.  Their secret code.  The code
            that will bind them for the rest of their lives.ON THE CROWD AND PLAYERSAll watching.  What the hell was that?  Sam blows his
            whistle.SAMPlay ball!  Play ball!

            The game heats up.  Lucy's team gets the ball and is headed
            toward the goal.  Sam is running right alongside them, so
            excited, until he can't hold himself back anymore and
            intercepts the ball!  Sam runs valiantly down the field with
            it!  We hear "Here Comes the Sun"...

            Little darlin', it's been a long, cold lonely winter.  Little
            darlin', it feels like years since you've been here.  Here
            comes the Sun...Here comes the sun...And I say, "It's
            alright..."
