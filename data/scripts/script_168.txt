    An intricate piano piece - GEORGE FREDERICK HANDEL...INTERCUT WHITE ON BLACK CREDITS WITH BELOW...1   INT. RUSTIC STUDIO OF AN ARTISAN. DAY 1                         1   *A series of shots.

    Blue sky through shabby windows.
    Run down walls. A paint splashed pine floor.    Tens of paint
    brushes soaking in stained jars.
    An artisan's hands - weather-worn, swirling a paint brush
    in dirty water that sways at the bottom of one of the jars.

    A canvas - the sketched face of a woman - blonde, blue eyed
    as the artisan strokes paint into her features - a poster
    girl for 18th century portraiture. (We will later
    recognise her as ELIZABETH MURRAY)CAPTION: ENGLAND 17662   EXT/INT. DOCKS/SLUM ROOM. ENGLAND - DAY. 2                      2   *A swallow cuts across a red tinged sky.   SOUND of footsteps
    trudging through mud.
    EXTREME CLOSE UP: a small figure being dressed by someone -
    a shoulder, an arm, little hands. We do not see a face.
    CLOSE: heavy naval boots move at sombre pace through slums.

    Against a stone floor, a child's feet are laced into boots.

    A starving dog barks , darts between tradesmen, sailors.
    Hold this image as Handel comes to an END.3   INT. SLUM ROOM - DAY. 2                                         3   *A CHILD'S POV as the door opens. We see a gentleman in
    ceremonial naval dress - CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY,
    aristocratic, handsome...alarmed at the sight before him.

    His eyes close with some sad, internal pain and as they re-
    open...We see what he sees...
    A fragile girl...around six years old stands in shabby
    surroundings. Her terrified eyes stare back, leaving
    LINDSAY at a loss. He takes in her features - delicate
    with a full mouth that underlines her ethnicity.

    She is DIDO ELIZABETH BELLE...part black, part white.2.He speaks quietly- words almost as fragile as she is.CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAYHello little girl...Little Dido.
                  (pause)
              I am your father.
    Silence. Then a tear rises to the surface and as her
    confused tears spill, so too do LINDSAY'S.

    His POV: a POOR BLACK WOMAN oversees DIDO from afar.CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D)(re. Dido)
              How lovely she is. So much of her
              mother.
                  (his eyes sting)
              I tried...but how...how could I
              separate a mother from her child?
                  (he restrains tears)
              And now nature has deprived me of
              such a dilemma.
    He composes himself - feeling futile...CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D)Thank you..for taking her.
    He reaches into his pocket, holds out money to the woman.CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D)You may leave us.

    The WOMAN hesitates, scurries to DIDO, placing her lips to
    the child's head in a prolonged kiss. Then she is gone.
    DIDO is left frightened and stunned!CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D)Do not be afraid sweet thing. I
              am to take you to a good life.
              The life you were born to.

    He takes out a cube of chocolate, shows it to her. She is
    reluctant. He takes a bite - delicious! DIDO moves
    forward. He puts the chocolate in her hand. She tastes
    it. Sweet cocoa and sugar..and now her tiny mouth is
    filled. It makes LINDSAY laugh out loud.4   EXT. DOCKS - DAY. 2                                          4    *A driver, HARRY - seated at a fine carriage.

    As HARRY becomes alarmed - from his POV LINDSAY moves
    towards us - the mulatto child in arms.3.5   EXT. KENWOOD HOUSE. LAWNS. DAY. 2                            5    *Silence, except bird song - the splendor of the English
    countryside - A neoclassical estate stretches before us.
    The figure of a LITTLE GIRL running across the lawns - her
    giggle fills the air, her outline faded by the sun.
    At French doors to the nursery, a furious greying woman -
    LADY MARY MURRAY (40s), waves a wooden spoon and yells...LADY MARYElizabeth Murray, bring yourself
               back here this very moment!

    The child crashes to the grass in fits of laughter. She is
    no more than 6 years old - Hair the colour of bleached hay
    and delicate pale skin.

    She rolls on to her back, squinting at the sunlight as...
    The SOUND of horse and carriage at the front of the house.
    ELIZABETH bolts upright. Her POV: As CAPTAIN SIR JOHN
    LINDSAY guides DIDO from the carriage.
    WIMBRIDGE, the butler, steps out to receive them.6   INT.   KENWOOD HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM. DAY. 2                   6    *LADY MANSFIELD (40s), the years have been kind. She is
    beautiful, regal - stares ahead in shock...
    LORD MANSFIELD (50's) - a majestic man, white wigged and
    low brows, is incandescent, his sister, LADY MARY, frozen.LORD MANSFIELDWhat in God's name have you done!!

    Their POV - LINDSAY and little DIDO stand.LADY MANSFIELDShe...she is black.

    LINDSAY is pained.CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAYShe is my blood.LADY MARYBut she IS black!LORD MANSFIELDA detail you chose NOT to share.CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAYUncle? You assured me!4.LORD MANSFIELD(fury)
          Captain Sir John Lindsay, do you
          find me a fool? She is a MULATTO!

LORD MANSFIELD'S blood boils, he rages towards LINDSAY. LADY
MANSFIELD restrains him. LINDSAY is red with humiliation.CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAYI have no wife to take her...In a
          few hours I am to captain a
          voyage to the Indies on a
          longitude experiment.
              (strained)
          From there, who knows!!! It is
          not in my gift to question the
          King and his Royal Navy.LORD MANSFIELDYou keep in mind my position..?
          My reputation...?CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAYSir...LORD MANSFIELDThen have some sense of propriety
          boy...and understand what you are
          asking.
LINDSAY lowers his voice, shielding DIDO.SIR JOHN LINDSAYHer mother is dead! My wishes may
          not be orthodox but they ARE
          necessary!LORD MANSFIELDHow do we raise her...?SIR JOHN LINDSAYI beg you, uncle...love her - as
          I would, were I here.
              (sadly)
          And ensure that she is in receipt
          of all that is due to her as a
          child of mine.

LADY MARY gasps, under...LADY MANSFIELDThat is simply impossible.SIR JOHN LINDSAYWhat is right can never be
          impossible.5.His firm gaze holds his aunt and uncle to account. A long
beat. LADY MANSFIELD stands conflicted.LADY MANSFIELDWhat has she been named?SIR JOHN LINDSAYShe is Belle...after her mother.
          Dido Elizabeth Belle...Lindsay.LORD MANSFIELDShe takes your name?SIR JOHN LINDSAYI am not ashamed.

LINDSAY stands his ground.LADY MARYWe cannot have another
          Elizabeth in the household.
LADY MANSFIELD regards the child, then looks to her
husband, gravely. He turns his back - aggrieved.LADY MANSFIELDWe...we will call her Dido.
              (off Lindsay's nod)
          Good Lord, she is thin. Mary,
          find her something to eat.
LORD MANSFIELD storms from the room. LADY MANSFIELD
follows. LINDSAY kneels, choked with emotion.SIR JOHN LINDSAYLittle Belle - sweet child...
              (weak smile)
          My wish is to keep you...keep you
          with me...but a ship...it is no
          place for one so precious as you.
              (pause)
          In these walls, yours will be a
          life equal to my blood.
A beat. Through eyes that brim...he catches his breath.
LADY MARY is both stunned and moved - she has to turn away.SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D)You will not understand in this
          moment, but hold this in your
          heart...you are loved...Just as
          I loved your mother.
A tear spills and DIDO's little fingers come up to wipe it
from his cheek. He presses his lips to her hand, sobbing a
moment, and then he is gone - to stay any longer would be
too much to bare.6.7   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. STAIRS/ENTRANCE HALL/GALLERY - DAY. 2    7    *ON ELIZABETH seated at the grand staircase as LADY MARY and
    DIDO emerge. Like ELIZABETH, DIDO is now freshly dressed in
    rich silks, an adorable sight as they move through corridorsELIZABETHAre you...a nee-gro?
    ELIZABETH makes her way across...taking her aunt's hand as
    all three walk. DIDO is silent.ELIZABETH (CONT'D)Are you what they call `a negro?'
              I heard them talking.LADY MARYQuestions, questions, Elizabeth!
              Tis a most irritating trait you
              and your father share.ELIZABETHPapaa M?LADY MARYNo your blood papaa. Sir David
              Murray. You should not insist on
              always speaking your mind, you
              know. You will end up an old maid
              with only your own company for
              entertainment!ELIZABETHLike you, Aunt Mary? That is what
              the maids say?LADY MARYYou little....

    ELIZABETH takes off. LADY MARY rushes after her.
    DIDO is left alone - through the doorway of the gallery, a
    portrait of LINDSAY stares at her. She gazes at it.

    LORD MANSFIELD approaches, arrested at the sight of DIDO,
    newly tidied. He follows her gaze to LINDSAY'S image. The
    sight affects him, unexpectedly.LORD MANSFIELDCaptain Sir John Lindsay.
                  (off her reaction)
              Do you recognise him?
    She nods. A beat as conflict fills him.7.8   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. GALLERY. CONTINUOUS. DAY 2                8    *LORD MANSFIELDD'you see here...? This..this is
                your grandfather, Sir Alexander
                Lindsay of Evelick.

    DIDO examines the painting. LORD MANSFIELD watches her.LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)I am here too....do you see?

    Her eyes search the long line of her aristocratic heritage,
    until her gaze settles. He chuckles, reluctantly charmed as
    she points to his likeness.LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)Yes...I am William Murray, First
                Earl of Mansfield.
    A beat as he looks to her, affected by this little person.
    Gently, he leads her to a final portrait.LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)(carefully)
                Now...do you see this man? He is
                my nephew...do you understand...?
                    (off Dido's nod)
                ...your uncle - Sir David Murray.DIDOElizabeth's papa.

    He pausesLORD MANSFIELDYou are a sharp little one. He is
                The Seventh Viscount Stormont...
                    (beat. Almost to himself)
                ...to inherit everything that we
                are standing on when I am gone.

    She nods, bites her lip - that much has gone over her
    head...he can see. He closes his eyes. The enormity of this
    new responsibility weighing heavy.9   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. LADIES PARLOUR/LAWNS - DAY. 2             9    *LORD MANSFIELD's POV: through window - The lawns. ELIZABETH
    gently takes DIDO'S hand in hers, leads her off to run
    between the trees. As their delighted screams filter...
    LADY MANSFIELD enters - observes LORD Mansfield, a moment.LADY MANSFIELDBorn on English soil?8.LORD MANSFIELDIndeed. He discovered her mother
aboard a captured Spanish slave
ship. He was charged with
conveying it back to these
shores, he tells me.LADY MANSFIELDEvidently he had some...`feeling'
for the woman.LORD MANSFIELD(dry)
And there I was believing it was
sheer lack of `self control'.
    (scathing)
He has been at sea, six years.
All of this child's life!LADY MANSFIELDWell, he clearly saw to their
wellbeing. The child is not
altogether uncivilized.
    (she breathes deeply)
So...now we have two nieces in
our guardianship.LORD MANSFIELD(reticent)
Elizabeth was much in need of a
companion.LADY MANSFIELDAnd that is what we shall say
when questions are asked of us?LORD MANSFIELDWe shall say that in accordance
with her birthright, she is
entitled to live beneath this roof.
    (with irony)
Such...is the nature of `order'.LADY MANSFIELDAnd where in this `order' should
her colour be placed? Below or
above her Murray bloodline?
    (off his silence)
May she dine with us?LORD MANSFIELDShe may...(pause)...NOT...in
company. We cannot escape
society's confines on etiquetteLADY MANSFIELDMarriage?9.He shakes his head at the complexity of it all.LORD MANSFIELDImpossible. Any match her..'other
               origins' may attract would surely
               disgrace her and the family rank.LADY MANSFIELDAnd when we are no longer here? No
               husband - who will take care of her?
     He rubs his eyebrows, perturbed, turns back to the lawns.10   EXT. KENWOOD HOUSE. LAWNS - CONTINUOUS. DAY.2/3              10   *A view across the idyllic estate. SOUNDS of children's
     shrieks have become adult.CAPTION: 1781A twenty year old DIDO darts between trees.DIDOBette! No...no surprises Bette!

     ELIZABETH, also twenty now, suddenly jumps from behind the
     willows, causing DIDO to wail hysterically.

     LADY MARY stands at the doorway of the old nursery.LADY MARY(shrieking)
               Girls! Will you refrain from
               shrieking like the...bless-ed
               French!

     The girls race towards the house.
     ELIZABETH'S blonde colouring remains, whilst DIDO'S looks
     have become dramatic - her dark hair, thick and long, wrapped
     in a bun, and black lashes that frame her dark eyes.11   EXT. HAMPSTEAD. CHURCH - DAY.3                               11   *Church bells - parishioners make their way into the

     He is chaotically handsome with deeply set, expressive eyes
     that lock with hers for a moment, stirring her. Then his
     gaze moves suddenly to LORD MANSFIELD - intense, as he
     watches him drift from the church, the family in tow.14   EXT. KENWOOD ESTATE. HEATH    - DAY.3                        14    *Pure, lush, green. The Mansfield carriage on the horizon.15   INT.

     resonates through her, silently. Her pained gaze slowly
     rises to meet LORD MANSFIELD'S.DIDO(quiet, shock)
               I thought I should one day have

               judgement on this appeal.
               Terrified you shall destroy
               England, no doubt. I know Lord A

ELIZABETH composes herself. JAMES' eyes remain on DIDO,
swallowing hard at her undeniable beauty.JAMESOne does not make a wife of the

               have prevented him, knowing that
               Miss Murray would visit today.

     ELIZABETH could burst. She looks up to see JAMES and
     OLIVER approach from the North side of the gardens.CUT TO:The ladies sip drinks as LORD ASHFORD appears from the

     OLIVER examines his father.LORD ASHFORD (CONT'D)She can not know your thoughts
               unless you offer them to her.
     He moves off, leaving OLIVER pensive.45.LORD ASHFORD (CONT'D)The ladies Mansfield! As sweet on
          the eye as the freshest flowers
          in bloom....

ELIZABETH is knelt at the pond's edge with JAMES - a paper
boat floats on the water, toppling over to a unanimous cry.

OLIVER watches as DIDO approaches. His eyes light up.ELIZABETHOh Dido look - Mr James has made
          me a boat and it has capsized.
JAMES stretches a branch into the lake to rescue the boat.DIDOWhat a dreadful shame.

OLIVER collects paper from the grass. CLOSE on his hands as
he folds it into a boat under DIDO'S nose.OLIVER(to DIDO, earnest)
          For you.
She smiles, can't help being charmed.DIDOThank you.
He places it in the water, stands and examines DIDO. From
afar, LADY MANSFIELD watches.OLIVERMiss Lindsay, would you do me the
          honour of taking some air with
          me, some time?
DIDO is dumbstruck - what to say? JAMES is halted.JAMESDon't you care what people will say46.DIDO is jolted by the antangonism in JAMES' tone -
     ELIZABETH too - it pierces her and she speaks up.ELIZABETHWhat is that to mean Mr James?
               What should anyone say?!
     JAMES hesitates, then...JAMESThat he should compromise a
               lady's reputation by stepping out
               with her - scarcely having made
               her acquaintance!OLIVERI think you are a great deal too
               anxious, brother. We should merely
               take a turn around Vauxhall.
     DIDO observes JAMES - His protestation is bitter. She
     traces OLIVER'S features, warmly.DIDOI should be delighted, Mr Oliver!

     OLIVER, then, LADIES MANSFIELD, MARY, and ASHFORD.LADY MANSFIELD(re. Dido with Oliver)
               I am not at ease with this.
               Lord Mansfield would be most
               aggrieved.LADY ASHFORDOh it can do no harm. This is
               simply two families, enjoying a
               day together.
     LADY MANSFIELD takes an unhappy breath, burdened.47.LADY ASHFORD (CONT'D)Though surely...IF a desirable
          match were a ... certain...
          possibility your dear husband could
          have no objections, could he?
LADY MANSFIELD, turns slowly to regard LADY ASHFORD,
aroused by the insinuation and alarmed at the same time.
She looks back to DIDO and OLIVER, wide eyed.OLIVERWell I did not think I would ever
          find a lady who was not to be
          conquered or ignored...Until you.DIDOAh now how do I know this is not
          just another tactic in your
          battle to conquer?
He stops, takes her hand and places it on in his chest.OLIVERSee how my heart beats.

She lets her hand rest a moment.OLIVER (CONT'D)I am utterly taken with you, Miss
          Lindsay.DIDODespite...such pronounced
          protestations from your brother?OLIVERHe cannot overlook your mother's
          origins, as I do. Foolish. Why
          should anyone even pay her regard
          when your better half has equipped
          you so well with loveliness and
          privilege.

Dido is stung. OLIVER shrugs, oblivious. The sound of Handel
filters from a nearby concert. DIDO tries hard to recover.DIDOWhat a lovely sound.

He smiles at her, studies her...mischievous...OLIVERYou are unrelentingly cultured.
          Come, let's find it!
He takes her waist spinning her round with him into another
pathway, disappearing from the others, giggling as they go.48.LADY MANSFIELDPeople will think she has no family!LADY ASHFORD.People will think they are courting!
LADY MANSFIELD and LADY MARY exchange a look. LADY MARY is
somehow softened - her eyes appeal to LADY MANSFIELD...LADY MARYLet her enjoy his society.
LADY MANSFIELD is effected - reads MARY'S emotion.
61.2: An open pavilion with classical concert. ON OLIVER
and DIDO watching.OLIVERI might only have dreamed of
          these moments, at one time.

DIDO smiles - allows herself to be flattered.DIDOReally? You are much of the
          conqueror Mr Oliver.
He chuckles, brings his hand up to brush her cheek, gently.
She smiles just as her eyes fall on the back of a gentleman's
head, shoulders - his movement somehow familiar.
The sight roots her, uncertain of what she sees. And then
he turns to address another, and his profile becomes clear.

It is JOHN DAVINIER.
In that moment, he flicks his head round and his gaze falls
on her - a beat between them then his eyes fall on OLIVER.
JOHN excuses himself from others and makes his way across.JOHNMiss Lindsay.DIDO(flushed)
          Mr Davinier. How...how nice to
          see you.JOHNAnd you, Miss Lindsay.
He looks to OLIVER.DIDOForgive me - Mr Ashford, may I
          present to you...Mr Davinier.

          Good day, to you...sir.

OLIVER bows, manfully, asserting his greater status.JOHNSir. (beat) My regards to
          your family, Miss Lindsay.
Unexpected hope fills her.DIDOElizabeth and Mamaa are here...
          in fact.

DIDO watches as JOHN nods politely and moves off, returning
to his company - male and all of a similar type to him.

ON OLIVER, as he takes in JOHN'S effect on DIDO.CUT TO:61.3. The spit and bang of spectacular fireworks. OLIVER
stands engrossed as the sky lights up. DIDO looks up at
him. She wavers. Then...slowly she backs away from the crowdCUT TO:61.4 DIDO walks quickly - follows the sound of the concert
to find her way back to JOHN.

Her POV: JOHN listening diligently to the music. He double
takes at the sight of her hovering at the edge of the
concert. He stands alarmed, negotiates his way to her.JOHN(dismayed)
          Miss Lindsay, you are alone!!DIDOI did not have the chance to see
          you before you left...Mr Davinier
          ...to convey my apologies.JOHNApologies...?DIDOYour pupilage. Father would
          never have ended it...you...you

          Kenwood were it not...50.His eyes soften as he looks at her...JOHNHe would make mine a living hell,
          were he to know of us speaking.
DIDO tugs him into a quiet lane, away from the concert and
promenading.

Hardly a breath and BAM!! She is slammed against a walled
maze, suddenly!! JOHN pressed against her tightly!
Confused, her gaze darts around her, finds LADY MANSFIELD
and LADY ASHFORD ambling past along a cross path, oblivious.
DIDO freezes - held tightly against JOHN. She stares
panicked into his eyes and he into hers.

61.5:CUTAWAY So they do not see ELIZABETH as she strolls by
with JAMES - Her gaze falling on JOHN and DIDO, instantly.

ELIZABETH is stunned!!!! But doesn't falter.
61.4 CONT'D: As DIDO and JOHN look back - nothing but
anonymous strangers, leaving them none the wiser to being
discovered. JOHN pulls away, embarrassed...JOHN (CONT'D)Forgive me.
She nods, equally bashful. They regard each other.DIDOWhat are you doing here in London
          Mr Davinier?JOHNI am under a third cousin - a
          solicitor, here. Nothing more
          than petty disputes between
          unsavoury landlords and debauched
          tenants, but I cannot discount it.DIDONot what you wished for.JOHNI haven't given up on The Inns.
          Nothing worth having in life

          the future Mrs Davinier is well.JOHNVery well...thank you.51.DIDO is unexpectedly struck - recovers herself.DIDOI have tried to keep up - with
          the Zong. These past weeks.JOHN(agitated)

          simply know what value to put on
          another's life.DIDO(bitterly)
          What price, a worthless Negro.JOHN(frustrated)
          You utterly misunderstand me.
          I am saying that no man may have
          the value of that of cargo!!!
          Human beings cannot be priced,
          since we are priceless!! Freemen
          and slaves alike!
Her eyes begin to sting at the `integrity' in his words.JOHN (CONT'D)(enthused)
          I am with others here. We are
          all students in law - applying
          pressure on the insurance companies
          to refuse from here on to insure
          slaves on any ship. A simple clause.DIDOBut that would require a change
          of law. I know nothing but...JOHNA change in law - something the
          insurance companies can lobby for
          IF they can be persuaded to band
          together.

          Someone has to have the courage.
          How can we expect to be civilised
          if we live in a barbaric world.
His words wind her as JOHN shakes his head, frustrated. She
takes him in - he is so very handsome!52.JOHN (CONT'D)It is the utter injustice...the
          industrial slaughter of so many.
DIDO stares at him earnestly.DIDONo. It is more than that. It's
          the shame of a law that would
          uphold a financial transaction
          upon that atrocity.
She is scathing and accepting all at once, affecting him.JOHNThat is indeed the truth.

Their eyes are locked. An intimate beat that perturbs her.DIDOI have never heard anyone speak
          like you.JOHNNor I, you, Miss Lindsay.

He is emotional, it perturbs him too, now.JOHN (CONT'D)You must return. They will be
          anxious. Should I follow to see
          you safely.DIDONo we cannot risk it.
He nods - studies her....JOHNGood bye, Miss Lindsay.
              (he pauses)
          I suspect, we will never see each
          other again.
The thought strikes DIDO, uneasily.DIDOGood bye, Mr Davinier.

She turns, preparing herself.JOHNMiss Lindsay?!!

A beat as they regard each other - then she moves off.CUT TO:61.6: The whirl of the pleasure gardens...DIDO alone -
searching hard for OLIVER or the others. Her pace quickens as
a hand comes down on her shoulder, taking her breath away.OLIVERI did not dare return to Lady
          Mansfield without you.DIDO(relieved)
          I..I am terribly sorry. I thought
          I saw the others, I went after
          them....and found myself lost.
OLIVER studies her - she is so nervous...what is she
hiding? A moment - then his eyes become forgiving.CUT TO:61.7 ON LADIES MANSFIELD, MARY, ASHFORD, seated on a bench.LADY MANSFIELDIt's almost dark!LADY ASHFORDLook, here are James and Miss Murray.

She fixes on LADY MANSFIELD, lets her eyes do the talking...
LADY MANSFIELD exchanges a look with LADY MARY.LADY MANSFIELD(to Lady Ashford)
          Do I sense that an address is

LADY ASHFORD goes carefully...LADY ASHFORDShe is an exquisite girl...

          proving pleasant, Miss Murray.ELIZABETH(earnest)
          Oh most certainly.MR VAUGHANMiss Murray, I wonder, if you

She looks to her mother, stunned, his gaze follows...MR VAUGHANWith her Ladyship's permission?LADY MANSFIELDI shall make arrangements.
ON DIDO, as OLIVER chats to others. She moves past as...LADY ASHFORDA pity Lady Mansfield and I could not
          do business on James and Miss Murray.LADY MARYA greater pity you rejected her.LADY ASHFORDLet us not dwell on the
          unfortunate. Oliver and Miss
          Lindsay are a blissful match.
          Tell me, when exactly does she
          receive her inheritance?
As DIDO observes her reflection in waters - easy laughter
floats by - a group of gentleman josh.

A figure beside her turns - icy blue stare takes her in as
she meets his gaze and finds herself staring into the eyes
of JAMES ASHFORD.JAMES ASHFORD.Miss Lindsay. Not Husband
          hunting, are we?
              (off Dido's disdain)
          Good Lord, I forgot - you have
          ensnared my brother. Now is he to
          share his dining room with you, as
          well as his bed??
His words bury deep and painful.DIDOOh, Mr James, your manners are as
          poor as your brother's finances.JAMESAnd you are foolish enough to marry
          him. I on the other have no better
          use for your impoverished
          cousin!...(beat)...Though she does
          make for rather amusing sport!76.She follows his gaze through trees to ELIZABETH breathing
in the scent of the azaleas beside MR VAUGHAN. The joshing
gentlemen trickle away leaving only DIDO and JAMES.
She goes to move off. JAMES grabs her arm, spitefully.DIDOThat is painful, sir.JAMESHave you never been manhandled?DIDOIt is not in my repertoire to
          keep company with beasts.

He regards her - her disdain reflected in his eyes. His
free hand comes up, fingers rest on her lips, then spread,
as he crushes her beauty in his hand.
Her eyes fill as he brings her close. So close. She is
afraid, angry. She struggles desperately, spirited, both
arousing and alarming him. As she tears herself from himDIDO (CONT'D)How dare you? HOW DARE YOU!

He stares at her - takes her in, calmly. Then...JAMESWith ease.

DIDO wavers nauseous with contempt.   JAMES moves off.   She
watches, incensed, humiliated.

ELIZABETH strolls with MR VAUGHAN, as JAMES passes OLIVER,
he whispers to his brother.JAMES (CONT'D)You will destroy us. You will destroy
          the entire order of our family.
Nearby, DIDO emerges from the trees...LADY ASHFORDOliver has been searching for you!

LADY MANSFIELD notes DIDO'S odd demeanour, LADY MARY too.
Her eyes dart suspiciously to JAMES as he approaches.LADY MANSFIELDAre you unwell, my dear?
DIDO's affected eyes come up to meet her mother's. She goes
to answer...interrupted as...ELIZABETH gasps overwhelmed...ELIZABETHOh!..Mr James!77.A distressed DIDO follows her gaze back to JAMES.ELIZABETH (CONT'D)Lady Ashford, you had not mentioned

      ON LORD MANSFIELD with the LORD MAYOR. They weave past to
      sit with others, equally wigged - power houses of England,

      serious. LORD MANSFIELD is distracted...through the bustle

      LORD MANSFIELD'S POV: we make out JOHN debating intensely.93.JOHNAnd failing that does the law not
                have a duty?
      ON LORD MANSFIELD - his own group continue in conversation,
      but all his attention is on JOHN.JOHN (CONT'D)Do the bench and parliament not

                retard it! If not to protect us
                from others, then to protect us
                from ourselves! Laws that allow
                us to diminish the humanity of
                anybody, are not laws - they are
                frameworks for crime.
      ON LORD MANSFIELD - something going on behind the eyes. The
      rest of the room fades - making JOHN clear and crisp.JOHN (CONT'D)A constitution can never be finite
                - surely as humanity evolves so
                too must its laws. And frankly I
                really do not care if you as an
                individual are without character
                or conscience - But a land whose
                laws contain neither - whose laws
                sanction not control the barbarous
                among its citizens - that is a
                country whose hope is lost.

The words provoke LORD MANSFIELD. He stands, slamming his
hand to the driver's wall. The carriage halts abruptly.

JOHN stands at the carriage window, breathless. LORD
MANSFIELD looks down at him furious, suddenly disarmed by
the emotion in JOHN'S eyes.LORD MANSFIELDThis is not about Miss Lindsay.

          of us. It's about everything...

      doesn't want to show JOHN his empathy, fights it - but for
      a split second it escapes in the profound silence.
      He recovers himself - considers his words before he speaks
      quietly - as though from personal experience...LORD MANSFIELDMr Davinier, the world is a
                devastating place. You must learn
                to protect your emotions if you
                are to prevent matters of both
                law..and love from devastating you.

      She drags them away, sending DIDO a final surreptitious
      glance that says, the coast is clear for her. As she does,
      LADY MARY'S gaze follows - sees DIDO hiding. A beat. LADY

      DIDO's hand slides to JOHN'S.LORD MANSFIELDWhether the `jettison clause' of
                Marine Insurance Law may be brought
                to bear in this appeal. This is
                the question. That is, first:
                whether the slaves were drowned
                as an anticipatory act. An act to
                avoid the disease caused by their(MORE)97.LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)journey, killing them once on shore,
          and at their destination...depriving
          the slave owners of any compensation.
He takes in the gaze of a free black man in the gallery.LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)Or secondly: whether they were
          `jettisoned' as cargo! To save
          captain and crew from certain death,
          when the extended journey threatened
          shortage of drinking-water.
              (steely eyed)
          Let me be clear, loss of water on a
          ship constitutes a singularly
          dangerous affair - insurrection of
          thirsty and hostile slaves at its
          extreme - and an impossible task to
          share diminished water reserve, among
          all those living, at best. Each
          implies severe threat to the lives of
          the seamen. In such circumstances our
          law is transparent and equivocal -
          the jettisoning of enslaved cargo
          ...IS legal!
              (he spells it out)
          And in these circumstances, combined
          with unavoidable loss of water, our
          laws leave the ship-owners securely
          within their rights to make a claim
          ...and behoves the insurers to pay
          losses.DIDONo!

Gasps from around the room...gasps that turn into cries,
including DIDO'S own. JOHN is rigid, anger rising.LORD MANSFIELDThe ship's owners chose a tight
          `packing fashion' to transport
          the slaves...A popular fashion of
          transportation that is known for
          causing death and disease.

His voice is raised over the sounds of a chaotic court.LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)This choice of laying the slaves
          tightly together is undertaken at
          the Captain's own risk. In the
          event that over packing renders
          an avoidable lack of drinking water
          on board a protracted journey,
          such a decision may be viewed as
          simple `bad management' on a(MORE)98.LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)Captain's part, and further, weigh
          as his own risk. An extended journey
          - one in which the destination is
          overshot may also be viewed as
          the captain's own mismanagement.
The noise lowers to silence. LORD MANSFIELD settles on JOHN.LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)It is not legal...to discharge lives
          from a ship into the waters, to
          prevent those lives dying on land,
          and to facilitate insurance
          compensation. Whether they be the
          lives of horses... or human beings
          ...slaves or otherwise - It is
          not legal, neither is it right.

DIDO lets out a gasp - breathless relief.LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)Further, the claim of shortage of
          water is illegitimate shown by the
          evidence put forward. To my
          mind, it is clear a fraud has been
          committed in claiming insurance on
          slaves who were...drowned solely
          for financial gain.
He looks around the room - sees LORD ASHFORD's acceptance.
His eyes fall on DIDO now and here they remain.LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)It is my opinion, that the state of
          slavery is so odious a position that
          nothing may support it. This case
          has displayed with searing clarity
          the depravity of any such nation
          whose choice is to practice it. You
          may be certain that I have laboured
          over my judgement and statements
          today and am in full understanding
          of all of the ramifications. Justice
          be done,though the heavens may fall.
JOHN'S eyes brim at the realisation of those words.LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)I find in favour of the insurers
          and overturn the decision of the
          lower court. I order a retrial.

Stunned confusion in the courtroom. Then, all kinds of
commotion - anger, cheers amid shock. LORD MANSFIELD stands.CLERKAll rise!99.JOHN jumps up, desperate for eye contact through the
      commotion...but LORD MANSFIELD fixes ahead, moves off.
      DIDO stands, caught by her own breath. JOHN turns to her.
      She begins to sob. For the first time he pulls her close,

              (he speaks carefully)
          And that is why he ought to have
          a job befitting one.DIDO(a whisper - defiant)
          My affections are with him, Papaa.
          I wish for nothing...
          nothing, if not to be his wife.

She stares into LORD MANSFIELD's eyes - he takes in JOHN.LORD MANSFIELDIf you would Mr Davinier, I would
          like you to attend my chambers in
          the morning. There are matters I
          would like you to assist me with.JOHNYour Lordship?LORD MANSFIELDAnd if you think it a good
          idea...I wish to facilitate
          your entry to the Inns of Court.JOHN(tentative)
          That is to serve my qualification
          to The Bar?
The question LORD MANSFIELD once put to JOHN, is now answered.LORD MANSFIELDIndeed...(humbled)...Capabilities
          such as yours are clearly
          deserving of such considerations.
JOHN breathes heavily, also humbled, as his tears surface.JOHNI..I think it a very good idea, sir.

LORD MANSFIELD nods, then finally moves off.    JOHN can't
take it in. DIDO is breathless, eyes brim...JOHN (CONT'D)Can it be true?101.DIDOOf course. He sees what I see.
          His words were as clear as...JOHNNo! That your feelings for me are
          so? That you would be my wife..?
              (off her reaction, )
          Because, I cannot conceive of a
          life without you...and if...if
          such were all that were before
          me, Miss Lindsay, then my heart
          would never beat the same again.DIDOIt is not. It is not all that is
          before you Mr Davinier...
          (begins sobbing) I love you...for
          all that you are, and with
          all..all that I am.

He breaks down now too, wiping her tears before kissing her
through his own sobs. Then tears turn to laughter.

We draw back on the couple - two fragile figures, amid the
bustle of London town.
