 Revised First DraftFOR EDUCATIONALPURPOSES ONLYFADE IN:EXTREMELY TIGHT ON ELECTRONIC GUTSof a video camera. The screwdriver blade of a Swiss Army
knife ENTERS FRAME, methodically tightening a row of
screws.

PULL BACK to reveal:EXT. BOMBARDED NEIGHBORHOOD (WAR-TORN COUNTRY) - DAYOn the backslope of a mound of rubble, a three-man TV
crew (field producer, reporter, and cameraman, all
wearing flak jackets) waits while the cameraman, JEFFREY
TAYLOR, works to repair his malfunctioning minicam.

Throughout this sequence, ROD, the reporter, types on a
laptop computer, oblivious to what is happening around
him.

HOWARD, the field producer, lies on his stomach, peering
cautiously over the crest of the rubble through
binoculars.

Beyond him we see an empty street. It is lined with
buildings blasted by shells: a sawtooth wall in the
f.g., a ruined high-rise at the end of the street,
billboards in an unrecognizable foreign language.HOWARDHow about it, Jeff?

Jeff finishes his repair job, snaps the minicam closed.JEFFDone.

Jeff slips the knife back in his pocket, scrambles over
the loose bricks and stones to a position next to Howard.EXT. SAWTOOTH WALL - DAYA frightened woman lurks nervously in the shelter of the
wall. She is young, in her early twenties, with shining
dark hair down to her shoulders. She's carrying an
armload of books.EXT. MOUND OF RUBBLE - DAYJeff focuses the minicam.2.MINICAM POVFRAMED in the viewfinder we see the frightened woman.HOWARD (O.S.)Nice legs.

Jeff ignores Howard, PANS the minicam DOWN the street.
In the viewfinder we see the flash of sun on metal.EXT. RUINED HIGH-RISE - DAYA row of blasted windows. In one of the windows, a
sniper crouches. Sunlight glitters on his rifle barrel.EXT. MOUND OF RUBBLEJEFF(matter-of-fact)

          the middle.HOWARD(looking through
                  his binoculars)
          Stay on him. Stay on him.        Now go
          back to the woman. Now!

Jeff swings the minicam and --EXT. SAWTOOTH WALL - MINICAM POV-- the image blurs, then holds steady on the frightened
woman. Nervously, she peeks around the corner.HOWARD (O.S.)Back to the sniper.EXT. MOUND OF RUBBLEHOWARDStay tight on the sniper.
          Jesus -- look at him! He's about
          fourteen! Don't lose this!

Jeff kneels on the ridge, minicam on his shoulder.3.EXT. RUINED HIGH-RISE - POV THROUGH VIEWFINDERJeff's minicam ZOOMS IN ON the sniper. The sniper sees
the woman peeking and gets his rifle in firing position.JEFFHe sees her.EXT. MOUND OF RUBBLEHOWARDStay on her. If she runs, widen
          and try to get her and sniper in
          the same frame.

Jeff turns his head away from the camera and stares at
Howard.JEFFI said he sees her.HOWARDI heard you.    Stay on her.

Jeff looks to Rod for support but he's busy typing,
oblivious.

Jeff hesitates, then lifts the minicam to his eye again.EXT. RUINED HIGH-RISEThe sniper, taking aim.EXT. SAWTOOTH WALLThe frightened woman decides to make a dash for it.   She
takes off her high-heeled shoes, inhales deeply,
gathering herself to run.EXT. MOUND OF RUBBLEJeff watches through his viewfinder:JEFF(under his breath)
          No... no...EXT. STREETThe frightened woman bolts, sprinting barefoot across the
cobblestones, skirt lifted, slender legs flashing.4.EXT. MOUND OF RUBBLEJeff jumps to his feet, waves the minicam, shouting:JEFFSniper!   Sniper! Sni--STREETThe woman looks up in Jeff's direction, confused,
breaking stride --

We hear a burst of automatic gunfire --RUINED HIGH-RISEIn the window, the winking muzzle-flash of the sniper'sAK-47.STREETThe woman's body jolts from the impact of the bullets.
The books go flying from her hand. She spins to the
pavement, her hair billowing.JEFFjust stands there, a shattered expression. The camera
hangs at his side. He stares at the dead woman as a pool
of dark blood expands around her body.CUT TO:EXT. LOGAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (BOSTON) - RUNWAY -NIGHTA 747 touches down on the tarmac.CUT TO:EXT. INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL - NIGHTA late-model Jeep Cherokee is parked at the arrival curb.
AMY TAYLOR, Jeff's wife, peers out from behind the wheel,
scanning the crowd.HER POVJeff, carrying a single bag slung over his shoulder,
emerges from the terminal.5.BACK TO SCENEAmy gets out of the car, grinning. Jeff sees her and
hurries over. He drops his bag and they fall into each
other's arms, kissing hungrily. These are two people
passionately in love with each other.AMYGod, I missed you.JEFFMe too.AMYLet's get out of here. Where's
          your equipment? Don't tell me you
          checked it?JEFF(holds up his bag)
          This is it.AMYNo camera?

Jeff shakes his head no.AMYNo nothing?

Again Jeff shakes his head.       Amy arches an eyebrow.AMYAh ha.CUT TO:INT. JEFF AND AMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHTA modest apartment in the Back Bay neighborhood. Not
much furniture, but lots of books and CD's. On the
walls, blow-ups of arty photographs -- Amy in modeling
poses, plus many black-and-white scenery stills.

Jeff's bag is unopened on the floor. We see two nearly
full wine glasses on a table. The CAMERA TRACKS DOWN a
hallway TO the open bedroom door.INT. BEDROOM - NIGHTMore framed photographs.

Amy lies in bed, curled up against a pillow. The sheets
are tangled in post-coital disarray, the only sign of
disorder in this neatly arranged room.6.CLOSERAmy stirs, reaching her hand out toward the other side of
the bed, which is empty. She opens her eyes, surprised
to find herself alone.AMYJeff?

No reply.

Something catches her attention from across the room.
She rises, pulls a loose robe around herself and pads
over to a closed door. She knocks softly.AMYCan I come in?JEFF (O.S.)Sure.INT. DARKROOM - NIGHTA walk-in closet has been converted into a small
photographic darkroom. Moist 8 X 10 prints hang from a
clothesline, bathed in a warm red glow. The images are
moody black and white landscapes.

Jeff stands over the developer, timing a print. Amy
enters through a thick black curtain behind him. He
doesn't look up.AMYCouldn't sleep?

Jeff shakes his head. Amy looks over his shoulder at a
landscape photograph in the developing tray.AMYI remember when you took that. We
             had fun on that trip, didn't we?

Jeff nods.    Amy looks at him.     After a beat:AMYYou want to talk about it?JEFFThere's nothing to talk about.AMYC'mon, Jeff.(CONTINUED)7.CONTINUED:JEFFI told you. I quit.   Walked out.
             end of story.AMYThat's   it?

Jeff nods.AMYWhatever happened back there
          wasn't your responsibility. You
          can't keep beating yourself up
          over it.

He says nothing.AMYWhat do you think? You could have
          stopped that girl from getting
          killed?JEFFYou don't understand...

He stops, lifts his eyes.JEFFIt was different this time.

He breaks off and pushes through the curtain.    She
watches him go.CUT TO:INT. LIVING ROOM - KITCHEN AREA - NIGHTJeff pours himself a glass of milk. Amy enters, stands
on the other side of the counter. Jeff doesn't meet her
eyes. After a beat:JEFFI talked to Reynolds.
                (a beat)
         He thinks I could still get the
         job at the San Diego station.AMYOh, Jeff, you didn't...(CONTINUED)8.CONTINUED:JEFFThink of it. Low pressure, a
             steady paycheck. So I shoot city
             council meetings -- how bad could
             it be?

She looks at him, concerned.AMYIs that what you really want -- or
             are you just running away?JEFFWho's running? It's good money,
         full benefits. I'm tired of
         freelance. We could finally put
         some money in the bank.AMYYou know I'll never stand in your
         way. But you've worked so hard.
         Are you sure you want to throw it
         away?JEFFThrow what away? Don't you get
         it? I don't do anything. I sit,
         I watch, I film -- I let it
         happen.AMYYou're supposed to let it happen.
             It's your job.JEFFNo, Amy.   It's my excuse.

She looks at him, not understanding.       He hesitates.JEFFThat girl... it's like I was
          paralyzed. I wanted to do
          something, but I didn't. I just
          stood there and watched her get
          killed.

He looks at her, emotional.JEFFPlease, babe, I need this.     Say
             yes and we'll take as long    as you
             want -- drive cross-country    and
             make a vacation out of it.     What
             do you say?(CONTINUED)9.CONTINUED:Amy looks at him, considering. We hear a faint RUSH OF
WIND. Then it gets LOUDER... LOUDER... and --CUT TO:EXT. CREDIT MONTAGE - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - LOW ANGLE -DAY AND NIGHTThe metallic grill of the Cherokee explodes INTO FRAME as
the car whooshes over us, hurtling down the Massachusetts
Turnpike.

In a SERIES OF SHOTS, with CREDITS OVER, we see landmarks
form the cross-country trip: a Pennsylvania Dutch
farmhouse, a smoke-spewing factory in Ohio, the
Mississippi River, Kansas wheat fields, Loveland Pass and
the Continental Divide.DISSOLVE TO:EXT. OPEN DESERT - DAYThe middle of nowhere. Sand, weeds and sagebrush. A
two-lane highway stretches to the horizon like a ribbon
of asphalt.

The Cherokee cruises along the road. Its Massachusetts
plates seem out of place in this stark landscape.

There are no other vehicles.

MOVING CLOSER, we see that Jeff is driving.    Amy is sound
asleep in the reclined passenger seat.

In back, luggage, moving boxes, camera cases.INT. JEEP CHEROKEE - DAYThe AIR CONDITIONING WHISPERS. On the console are two
empty Styrofoam McDonald's coffee cups and a state-of-
the-art Nikon Camera.

Jeff stretches in the driver's seat. He forces his eyes
open, fighting sleep. He reaches for the coffee cup...
it's empty. He glances into the back of the Jeep. There
is a thermos of coffee on the back seat.

Keeping one hand on the wheel, he reaches for the thermos
and fumbles it to the floor. He strains to reach it. He
doesn't notice...10.EXT. HIGHWAY - 200 YARDS AHEADA slow-moving Dodge Ram pickup truck is approaching the
highway along a small road that cuts across the desert
floor.

The pickup, equipped with oversized tires, roll bar, and
a CB whip antenna, bounces over the uneven terrain and
turns onto the highway, stopping just before entering
Jeff's lane.INT. CHEROKEE - DAYJeff glances up just in time to see the Ram lurch into
the road in front of him. Jeff drops the thermos and
spins the wheel!

Amy's eyes fly open --EXT. HIGHWAY - DAYThe Cherokee goes into a wild looping skid. The Ram
jerks to a halt as the Cherokee whips past, averting a
collision by inches.INT. CHEROKEE - DAYJeff expels a breath. Amy turns to see the pickup
stopped in the road. She looks at him, concerned.AMYJesus, Jeff...JEFFSorry.     I took my eyes off the
          road.AMY(seeing thermos
                  on floor)
          Maybe it's time we took a break,
          you know?

Jeff nods, looks in the rearview mirror.HIS POV - PICKUPhalted in the middle of the road. Inside, dimly-visible
through tinted windows, are two figures in cowboy hats.

The driver leans out the window and gives Jeff the
finger.11.BACK TO JEFFangry at himself.    He looks over at Amy.JEFFI'll pull over next chance we get.
                 (a beat)
          Sorry...

He glances in the rearview again, still a bit shaken.CUT TO:EXT. GAS STATION - DAYA small desert gas station/mini-mart just off the
highway. A sign over the building: "Last Gas For 30
Miles." The Cherokee is parked at the pumps, hood
raised.

Jeff comes out of the mini-mart, carrying a   plastic quart
of oil. He unscrews the cap and starts to    fill the
crankcase, careful not to spill on the new   engine. In
the b.g., Amy is visible inside the store,   browsing a
magazine rack.INT. CONVENIENCE MART - SAME TIMEAmy thumbs through a cheap tourist guide, The Desert
Southwest. A TRUCK DRIVER stands nearby, perusing the
magazines. He glances in Amy's direction, notices what
she's reading.TRUCKEROn vacation?

Amy looks up at him. He's 50ish, plain-looking,
friendly, wearing a "U.S.A." logo baseball cap.AMYSort of.    We're moving, actually.TRUCKERWhereabouts?

Amy hesitates. She's not used to talking with strangers,
but the guy seems harmless enough.AMYCalifornia. We thought we'd take
          the scenic route.(CONTINUED)12.CONTINUED:TRUCKERHuh. In that case, you oughta try
           the Pass Road, 'bout thirty miles
           west. Real pretty, makes a loop
           through the hills, then hooks back
           up with the highway.

Amy smiles politely, moves toward the cash register.AMYThanks. I'll mention it to my
           husband.

The Trucker tips his cap.TRUCKEROkay, then. Good luck.   Enjoy the
           rest of your trip.EXT. GAS STATION - DAYAs Jeff continues pouring the oil, he doesn't notice the
mud-streaked Dodge Ram pickup pulling up to the pumps
behind him. The driver, EARL, climbs out. The other man
remains in the cab with the smoked windows rolled up.

Earl is a beefy man about Jeff's age. He wears a sweat-
stained Western hat, cowboy boots and a T-shirt with the
sleeves cut out to display his tattooed biceps. He
saunters over to the Cherokee, stands there a beat,
looking over Jeff's shoulder.

Jeff senses something behind him, turns. His eyes widen
as he sees Earl, recognizes the pickup as the one he
nearly hit a few minutes before. Earl stares at him,
unsmiling.EARL(flatly)
           Nice car.

Jeff is in an awkward position. He's got a half-full
upside-down bottle of oil in his hands. If he lifts it
now, he'll spill on the engine. He turns his gaze back
to the engine, decides to keep pouring.JEFFThanks.

Earl steps around to the open passenger window, peers in.
Jeff watches him, wary.(CONTINUED)13.CONTINUED:EARLAir, C.D., leather -- I guess you
             sprung for the whole nine yards.JEFFI guess.EARLThen again, out here, what you
             really need's a C.B. radio.JEFFIs that right?

The oil bottle empties    out. Relieved, Jeff pulls it away
and screws back on the    crankcase cap. He shuts the hood
with a thunk and moves    around to the side of the car to
remove the gas nozzle    from the tank. Earl blocks his
path.EARL'Course, if you use a C.B., you
             gotta have a handle.

Jeff says nothing.      This is not a friendly conversation.EARLHow about Shit-for-Brains?
                    (beat)
             You damn near killed us back
             there, boy.JEFFLook, I'm sorry, I didn't see you.
         You pulled out in front of me.EARLThe hell I did. I saw what
         happened.

Looking past Earl, Jeff sees Amy come out of the mini-
mart with a bag of groceries. He speaks carefully,
anxious to avoid a confrontation.JEFFHow about if we just forget it,
         okay? I'm sorry it happened. I
         don't want any trouble.EARL(snorting)
         Yeah.     I bet you don't.(CONTINUED)14.CONTINUED:Earl glares at Jeff before turning away.    He passes Amy,
gives her a broad smile.EARLHowdy, ma'am. Caught this fellow
             tryin' to steal your Cherokee.

Amy takes in the situation. She nods politely. Earl
continues into the mini-mart. She approaches Jeff,
puzzled.AMYWhat was that about?JEFFNothing. Guy in the truck.
             Thinks I tried to hit him.

Jeff glances apprehensively at the man in the pickup, who
has not moved during the scene. He looks back at the
mini-mart.JEFFC'mon, let's go.AMYYou want me to drive?JEFFLater.   Just get in.AMYIs something wrong?JEFFNo, let's just go.

Jeff climbs in behind the wheel. Amy glances at him and
gets in the car. Jeff keys the IGNITION and pulls away.INT. CHEROKEE - DRIVING - DAYAs Jeff steers back onto the highway, he glances in the
rear-view mirror, sees --MIRROR POVEarl coming out of the mini-mart, staring after the
disappearing Jeep.(CONTINUED)15.CONTINUED:Jeff shifts in his seat, relieved to be getting away from
there. Amy watches the speedometer as it climbs to 75,
then 80, then 85.AMYThis isn't the Grand Prix, you
             know.

Jeff releases his foot from the accelerator.     The needle
sinks back down to 65.

She gives him a long contemplative look.AMYWhat's bothering you?JEFFI told you. Nothing.
                 (pause)
          The guy was an asshole.

Keeping an eye on the rear-view mirror, Jeff nods toward
the grocery bag, trying to change the subject.JEFFWhat'd you get?

Amy pulls out an assortment of candy bars and junk food.AMYJunk food fiesta. Sno Balls, Yoo
          Hoo, Moon pies... can you believe
          they still make this stuff?JEFFYou kidding. It's probably
          gourmet cuisine around here.CUT TO:EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - AERIAL - DAYFar below us, the Cherokee traces the empty highway.
There are no buildings, no houses, no other vehicles.DISSOLVE TO:INT. CHEROKEE - DRIVING - FEW MINUTES LATERJeff drives in silence. Amy stares out the window,
bored. Looking for a distraction, she picks up a
cellophane package of doughnuts and peruses the label.(CONTINUED)16.CONTINUED:AMY(trying to brighten
                     the mood)
             This is crazy. Look at this.
             Says if you win this mail-in
             contest, you can choose either
             ninety thousand dollars or ninety
             thousand doughnuts.

She gives him a playful glance.AMYWhat would you do with ninety
             thousand doughnuts?

Jeff shrugs, disinterested.JEFFI dunno... Sell 'em for thirty
             cents each and pay off this car.AMYVery funny.
                    (beat)
             Alright, what about ninety
             thousand dollars? What would you
             do with that?

Jeff stares out the window.       He's not into this.JEFFI don't know.    Look, Amy, I'm
          not --

Suddenly his eyes drop to the console between them --JEFFSonofabitch!! My camera!        He
          stole my camera!AMY(startled)
          Who?JEFFThe redneck at the gas station!
          He lifted it right under my nose!
          My brand new Nikon.
                 (pounds wheel
                  in frustration)
          Goddammit.AMYShould we go back?(CONTINUED)17.CONTINUED:JEFFWhat's the use. He's probably
          halfway to Bumblefuck now, the
          bastard.AMYLook, maybe if we call the cops --

Jeff is about to reply when suddenly the car bucks.JEFFWhat the hell?

The car gives another jolt.AMYWhat'd you do?JEFFNothing.   I --

A warning light flashes on the instrument panel. The
brakes and steering lose power. The engine quits cold.JEFFHang on -- I can't steer!

The CAR bucks and SCREECHES. After a few HICCUPS, it
jerks to a halt, just beyond a crest in the road.

For a moment, they sit there dazed, staring ahead at the
empty road. Then Amy notices an object on the floor --
the Nikon. She picks it up.AMY(deadpan)
          Found your camera.

He rolls his eyes.   He yanks the hood release and gets
out.EXT. HIGHWAY - DAYSteam pours from under the    hood of the Cherokee. Amy
gets out and looks around    at the scorched wasteland.
Jeff goes to the front of    the car, gropes under the hood
for the release latch. He     yanks his hand away, burned by
the hot metal.JEFFOw!(CONTINUED)18.CONTINUED:AMYAre you okay?JEFFI'm fine.

Amy moves to Jeff to examine the burn.     She reaches out.JEFF(annoyed)
          I said I'm fine, okay?

Jeff lifts the hood, examines the engine. He tugs on a
cable, checks the battery connection and radiator.

He goes to the passenger's side and takes a hand-held
cellular phone from the glove box. He dials zero and
hits "send." The PHONE BEEPS.AMYOut of range?

Jeff grunts, tosses the phone on the seat. It bounces
and lands on the floor. Amy watches as he returns to the
engine and begins unscrewing the radiator cap.AMYWhat's going on, Jeff?JEFFWhat's it look like?      I'm trying
          to fix the car.AMYNot the car.JEFFWhat?AMYWhat's going on with you?

Jeff busies himself with the engine, not answering.AMYIt's been a month since you got
          back. You can't keep shutting me
          out like this.

Jeff says nothing.AMYJeff, I'm talking to you.(CONTINUED)19.CONTINUED:JEFF(flaring)
             Look, I really don't want to go
             into this right now. I'm changing
             jobs, our finances are fucked, and
             we're stuck in the middle of
             nowhere. So could we maybe just
             fix the --

He stops in mid-sentence. There is a RUMBLE in the
distance. They look down the road.JEFFChrist, not these guys...JEFF'S POV - DODGE RAM PICKUPapproaching fast on the road. As it streaks past, Earl
yells and launches a beer bottle from the window. The
BOTTLE SHATTERS on the asphalt.BACK TO JEFFwatching the Ram speed away.JEFFAsshole...AMY(looking down
                     the road)
          Jeff --

A quarter-mile away, the pickup is slowing. It pulls a
U-turn and stops, facing the Cherokee. It just sits
there, ENGINE IDLING.JEFFWhat the hell?AMYWhat's he doing?JEFFI don't know.

Jeff watches the pickup, frowning. Then, from the
opposite direction, they hear a LOW RUMBLE. They turn
and stare at --20.MASSIVE TRACTOR-TRAILERcoming over a crest in the road.

It's a huge eighteen-wheeler. A white 1988 Peterbilt.
It grinds into low gear and slows, BRAKES CREAKING.

The TRUCK comes to a halt with a HISS of compressed air.DOWN HIGHWAYthe PICKUP STARTS UP again. It pulls another U-turn and
drives away, melting into the desert.AMYbreathes a sigh of relief.

The driver dismounts from the cab, leaving the ENGINE
IDLING. We recognize him as the Trucker in the mini-
mart. He removes his cap, revealing a shock of
prematurely white hair. He is well-shaven, his clothes
immaculate. His name is Red.RED (TRUCKER)You folks all right?JEFFYeah.   Our car broke down.RED(chuckling)
          I figured that much. You want a
          hand pushing it off the road?JEFFThanks, I'd appreciate it.    Amy,
          you want to steer?

Amy gets behind the wheel and puts the shift in neutral.
Jeff and Red push the car to the shoulder. As they push,
Jeff glances at the CB antenna on Red's cab.JEFFThink you could radio a tow truck
          for us?REDI sure would if I could, mister,
         but my C.B. blew a fuse this
         morning. I'm waiting till I hit
         the truck stop on I-40 to get it
         fixed.(CONTINUED)21.CONTINUED:JEFFHow far is that?REDAbout 60 miles.JEFF(disappointed)
             Oh.

Red walks around to the front of the car and peers down
at the exposed engine.REDI'd offer to take a look, but it's
          hard to say with these new
          engines. Used to be, you could
          give 'em a kick and a holler and
          they'd start right up. Now it's
          all computers and chips.JEFFIt's a new car.REDThat could be the problem. You

Amy gives Jeff a reprimanding look.     It's subtle, but Red
notices.REDTell you what. If you want a
          ride, there's a little diner up
          the road. Belle's. They got a
          pay phone. You could call a tow
          truck from there.

Jeff considers this, glances back to where the Dodge Ram
was last seen.JEFFNice     of you to offer. But we've
          got a     lot of stuff in the car. I
          think     we're better off waiting for
          a cop     to come along.

smile. He glances up at a small plane flying overhead.(CONTINUED)22.CONTINUED:RED(casually)

Jeff. She waits till the trucker is out of earshot.AMYAre you nuts?JEFFWe don't know this guy.AMYHe's offering to help. It       could

careless:AMYStupid was letting you talk me
             into leaving Boston.

She turns away. The truck starts to pull out. She bites
her lip, thinking, then steps into the road and flags the
truck down. Red brakes.AMYExcuse me? Do you think you could

She goes to the passenger side of the Jeep for her purse.
Jeff follows, lowering his voice.JEFFWhat do you think you're doing?AMYI'm going to the diner. I'm going

She walks to the truck. Jeff stands there. She climbs
into the cab. Red moves some papers out of the way.REDWatch your step, ma'am.

Jeff looks around, not particularly trusting the

Snickers from some of his bar mates, who avert their eyes
when Jeff glances at them. Jeff knows this is almost
certainly a put-on, but he can't take a chance.

While the Barflies watch, poker-faced, Jeff walks to the
door of the ladies room, hesitates, then knocks. His
knock is answered by a wordless sound, HALF-GROAN, HALF-GASP.JEFFAmy?

Jeff strides angrily for the exit. He stops at the door,
takes one last look around. No one seems to be paying
him much attention. He turns to leave...

... but something stops him. He can't put his finger on
it. There's something wrong here...

He stares at the other customers. Why do they avoid eye
contact? Are they hiding something?

He scrutinizes more closely...

There is the gruff trucker, sitting at a nearby table
shoveling food in his mouth. He's been averting his gaze
ever since Jeff walked in.

And then there's the traveling salesman. Overweight,
sweaty. Popping vitamins along with his coffee.

Or what about the shirtless biker, reading a comic book
at the bar? Probably an ex-con.

While Jeff is running these suspicions through his mind,
a trucker approaches the counter to place an order. The
Bartender jots it down on a pad, then tears off the
carbon slip. He places one copy above the grill and
another in a pile by the cash register.

He approaches the bar.JEFFI want to see your order slips.BARTENDERWhat?JEFFYou write down the names.   I want

clamps onto his.BARTENDERMister, I've had just about enough

          one unmarked car, one plane, one
          human being who even smells like a

Jeff hesitates, then raises the binoculars.THROUGH BINOCULARSThe IMAGE SHIFTS, then STEADIES and FOCUSES ON a small
building with a police cruiser out front and a barely
legible sign: "BRACKETT SHERIFF." It's the police
station where Jeff filed the missing persons' form
earlier.RED (O.S.)There's exactly two cops in this
          town. One of them's inside
          pulling ass duty; the other's on

          minute ago one of my men called in
          a non-injury accident on the I-40
          connector.

Deputy Carver comes out of the building gulping down a
sandwich. He gets in the cruiser and pulls away, lights
flashing.RED (O.S.)It'll take that good ol' boy 20
          minutes to get to the connector,

The cruiser pulls away down the highway.61.JEFFlowers the binoculars and looks at Red.REDThat's your deadline. If for any

jogging, then running.62.EXT. STREET - DAYJeff hurries toward the bank. He looks back at the mesa

Up ahead, a mud-streaked pickup cruises the main street.
Jeff eyes it warily. Is it one of theirs? The truck
pulls around a corner.INT. BANK - DAYJeff pushes through the main doors. It's a typical small
town operation. A guard stands near the entrance.
Several customers wait in line for the woman teller.

Jeff looks at the slow-moving line and swears softly. He
doesn't have time to wait. He glances around, sees an
older man sitting at a desk in the rear of the bank, the
nameplate on the desk identifying him as Roger Calhoun.
Jeff approaches.JEFFI need to see the manager. I need
          a wire transfer from my bank in

CALHOUN looks up from his paperwork, hesitates at Jeff's

nervously.CALHOUNSir?JEFF(turning; preoccupied)

Calhoun raises an eyebrow and begins filling out the

He startles at his reflection in the mirror.     He is
sunburned, dirty, lacerated.

He opens a cabinet and rifles through the supplies,
looking for anything that could be used as a weapon.     He
tosses aside detergents and air fresheners.

He picks up   the toilet plunger, pulls the wooden rod from
the rubber   base. He swings it into his palm a few times,
testing it   as a club. It's too bulky. He won't be able
to conceal   it.

He checks his watch. Time is running out.      He takes one
last look around the bathroom, then exits.65.INT. BANK - DAYJeff comes out of the rest room. The manager is behind
the teller's counter. The cowboy is gone. In his place
sits a middle-aged blue collar worker. He looks at Jeff.

Jeff takes a seat, glances at Calhoun's empty desk.
There is a letter opener on the desk, several paper bands
for wrapping currency.

Positioning his body so no one can see, Jeff takes the
letter opener and slips it into his sleeve. He scoops up
a handful of currency wrappers.

Jeff goes to the teller's window, scribbles something on
the back of a deposit slip and hands it to the teller.JEFFWould you tell the manager I want
          the money in these denominations?

THUNDERS past, blowing a cloud of dust and sand in his
face.

Jeff continues walking, anxiously checking over his
shoulder every few moments. His eyes narrow.

Jeff looks around, wonders if Earl would risk shooting
him in view of passing traffic.

Jeff hesitates, then tosses the envelope on the      seat.
Earl opens it, reaches in and pulls out several      packets
of currency. They are wrapped with paper bands       and
appear to be stacks of fifties and hundreds. He       replaces
them and gestures at Jeff with the gun.EARLNow lift your shirt and jacket and

Jeff struggles into an awkward kneeling position on the
floor, facing the rear of the pickup, his belly pressed
against the seat.

Jeff quickens his pace alongside the truck stop building,
passing a row of pay phones. He looks up, stops dead.

turns away.

When he looks up, Red is walking toward his Peterbilt
truck, parked in a row of big rigs. Jeff starts to
follow, then freezes.

Several cops are fanning out on foot, questioning
everyone they encounter.

Jeff sees Red getting into his truck. The ENGINE KICKS

Suddenly his grip falters on the grease. His back
scrapes the rushing asphalt. Jeff gasps, makes a grab
and holds firm.

As he hangs on, a station wagon overtakes the Peterbilt
in the passing lane. A three-year-old boy sits in the
rear compartment, staring out at Jeff, a puzzled
