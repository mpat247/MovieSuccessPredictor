SUBWAY CAR - PETER AND SHERMAN - LATE AFTERNOON           228-I*as the car slows down.     Sherman is slightly drunk.SHERMAN... and then this newspaper thing
                     started, this Peter Fallow person,
                     and all the facts were wrong, total
                     disregard for the truth. Why do

                     me. Newspapers, lawyers, police,
                     people I don't even know. How did
                     I get to be so important?PETERYou're not important. You're just
                     dinner. You know what I mean? And
                     a week from now, a month -- nobody

                     ate.

        remains in the car. Sherman looks back at him.SHERMANI should have called the police
                     right away, when it happened. But
                     I couldn't you see? It wasn't

                    suffered. But ten million dollars

                    things, Reverend, thank you. I
                    been worried about my clothes for
                    instance. I feel that the
                    presentation of my person should
                    be carefully designed. As a model
                    to black mothers everywhere, I
                    think I should have the right
                    wardrobe. So if you could have
                    Mr. Fox's limousine pick me up in

                    continue to live in that shithole
                    of an apartment at least until
                    after the lawsuit is settled, I
                    would like to start looking now
                    for a co-op in Manhattan -- for me
                    and my son -- something with a view
                    of the river and preferably in a
                    neighborhood that is at least

      More silence.    He comes down off the bench, facing the

                   Justice is not the will of the few
                   and it's not the will of the many.
                   Justice is not politics. Justice
                   is the law. And the law is man's
                   feeble attempt to set down the
                   principles of decency. Decency!
                   And decency is not a deal. Or an
                   angle, or a contract, or a hustle
                   or a campaign or a trick or a bid
                   for sympathy. Decency is not the
                   beast that bays for money, power,
                   dominion, position, votes and
                   blood! Decency is what your
                   mother taught you! Decency is
                   in your bones! Do I make myself
                   clear! Now go home. Go home now.
