     The Blank Screen and Title Card SHATTER to reveal...1. EXT. SHERMER HIGH SCHOOL - DAYDuring Brian's monologue, we see various views of things
     inside the school including Bender's locker.BRIAN (VO)Saturday...March 24, 1984.  Shermer
               High School, Shermer, Illinois.
               60062.  Dear Mr. Vernon...we accept
               the fact that we had to sacrifice a
               whole Saturday in detention for
               whatever it was that we did wrong,
               what we did was wrong.  But we think
               you're crazy to make us write this
               essay telling you who we think we
               are, what do you care?  You see us
               as you want to see us...in the
               simplest terms and the most
               convenient definitions.  You see us
               as a brain, an athelete, a basket
               case, a princess and a criminal.
               Correct?  That's the way we saw each
               other at seven o'clock this morning.
               We were brainwashed...CUT TO:2. INT. CLAIRE'S CAR - DAYWe see CLAIRE and her FATHER sitting in their car in the
     parking lot.

     Claire is the prom queen and is clearly a snob.CLAIREI can't believe you can't get me
               out of this...I mean it's so absurd
               I have to be here on a Saturday!
               It's not like I'm a defective or
               anything...CLAIRE'S FATHERI'll make it up to you...Honey,
               ditching class to go shopping
               doesn't make you a defective.  Have
               a good day.

     Claire rolls her eyes and gets out of the car and walks
     up the school front stepsCUT TO:3. INT. BRIAN'S CAR - DAYWe are in BRIAN's car.  His MOTHER is there and so is
     his little SISTER.  He is sort of a nerd.BRIAN'S MOTHERIs this the first time or the last
               time we do this?BRIAN(upset)
               Last...BRIAN'S MOTHERWell get in there and use the time
               to your advantage...BRIANMom, we're not supposed to study; we
               just have to sit there and do
               nothing.BRIAN'S MOTHERWell mister you figure out a way to
               study.BRIAN'S LITTLE SISTER(annoyingly)
               Yeah!BRIAN'S MOTHERWell go!

     Brian gets out of the car and walks towards the school.CUT TO:4. INT. ANDREW'S CAR - DAYWe see ANDREW and his FATHER.  Andrew is clearly a jock;
     he�s wearing a letterman�s jacket with lots of patches on it.ANDREW'S FATHERHey, I screwed around...guys screw
               around, there's nothing wrong with
               that.  Except you got caught, Sport.ANDREWYeah, Mom already reemed me, alright?ANDREW'S FATHER(angry)
               You wanna miss a match?  You wanna
               blow your ride?  Now no school's
               gonna give a scholarship to a
               discipline case.

     Andrew gets out of the car and walks into the school.CUT TO:5. EXT. SHERMER PARKING LOT - DAYWe see JOHN BENDER walking towards us.  He is wearing
     sunglasses.  A car is coming towards him but he doesn't
     stop walking.

     The car slams on its breaks directly in front of him.

     Bender gets out of the frame.  Out of the car steps
     ALLISON.  She is dressed all in black.  She steps
     forward to look in the car's front window and the car
     drives away.CUT TO:6. INT. LIBRARY - DAYThere are six tables in two rows of three.
     Claire is sitting at the front table.  Brian comes in
     and sits at the table behind her.

     Andrew comes in and points at the chair next to Claire
     at the front table.  She shrugs and he sits there.

     In walks Bender, he touches everything on the checkout
     desk and takes a few things in the process.

     He walks over to where Brian is sitting and points to
     the table on the opposite side of the Library.  Brian
     reluctantly gets up and moves.

     Bender sits at the table where Brian was and puts his
     feet up.

     Allison walks in.  She walks all the way around the
     library and sits in the back corner table, just behind
     Brian.

     Andrew and Claire look at each other and snicker.

     Brian looks at her in confusion and then turns away.

     Enter RICHARD VERNON, a teacher.  He holds a stack
     of papers in his left hand.  He addresses the group with
     such disrespect it makes you wonder how he ever got the
     job.VERNONWell...well.  Here we are!  I want
               to congradulate you for being on
               time...

     Claire raises her hand.CLAIREExcuse me, sir?  I think there's
               been a mistake.  I know it's
               detention, but...um...I don't think
               I belong in here...

     Vernon doesn't care.  He just continues to talk.VERNONIt is now seven-oh-six.  You have
               exactly eight hours and fifty-four
               minutes to think about why you're
               here.  To ponder the error of your
               ways...

     Bender spits into the air and catches the spit in his
     mouth again.

     Claire looks like she is going to gag.VERNON...and you may not talk.  You will
               not move from these seats.

     He glances up at Bender and points at him.VERNON...and you...

     Vernon pulls the chair out from under Bender's feet.VERNON...will not sleep.  Alright people,
               we're gonna try something a little
               different today.  We are going to
               write an essay--of no less than a
               thousand words--describing to me
               who you think you are.BENDERIs this a test?

     Vernon passes out paper and pencils and takes no notice
     of Bender.VERNONAnd when I say essay...I mean essay.
               I do not mean a single word repeated
               a thousand times.  Is that clear Mr.
               Bender?

     Bender looks up.BENDERCrystal...VERNONGood.  Maybe you'll learn a little
               something about yourself.  Maybe
               you'll even--decide whether or not
               you care to return.

     Brian raises his hand and then stands.BRIANYou know, I can answer that right
               now sir...That'd be "No", no for me.
               'cause...VERNONSit down Johnson...BRIANThank you sir...

     He sits.VERNONMy office...

     Vernon points.VERNON...is right across that hall.  Any
               monkey business is ill-advised...

     He looks around at them.VERNON...any questions?BENDERYeah...I got a question.

     Vernon looks at him suspiciously.BENDERDoes Barry Manilow know you raid his
               wardrobe?VERNONI'll give you the answer to that
               question, Mr. Bender, next Saturday.
               Don't mess with the bull young man,
               you'll get the horns.

     Vernon leaves.BENDERThat man...is a brownie hound...

     Everyone tries to get comfortable and we hear a loud
     snapping sound.  Brian turns and looks and it is
     Allison, biting her nails.

     Bender's eyes widen as he turns to look.  Everyone is
     looking now.  Allison notices them looking at her.BENDERYou keep eating your hand and you're
               not gonna be hungry for lunch...

     Allison spits part of her nail at Bender.BENDERI've seen you before, you know...

     We see Vernon look out from his office.

     We see Brian playing with his pen.BRIAN(quietly to himself)
               Who do I think I am?  Who are you?
               Who are you?

     He attaches the pen to his bottom lip and puts the top
     under his upper lip.BRIANI am a walrus...

     Bender looks at him in utter confusion.  Brian notices
     this, laughs and takes the pen out of his mouth--
     embarrassed.

     Bender and Brian begin to take their jackets off at the
     same time.  They both notice this.  Brian stops removing
     his jacket.

     Bender takes his all the way off.  Brian rubs his hands
     together and pretends to be cold.  He pulls his jacket
     back on.  He turns and looks at Bender who is still
     staring at him.BRIANIt's the shits, huh?

     Bender glares at him and Brian utters an uncomfortable
     laugh.

     Bender turns away and crumples up his essay paper.  He
     throws it at Claire.  It misses and goes over Claire's
     head.

     Andrew and Claire acknowlege it but continue to ignore
     Bender.

     Bender starts loudly "singing" the musical part of a
     song.  �Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah...nah, nah, nah...�CLAIRE(to herself)
               I can't believe this is really
               happening to me...

     Bender stops "singing" abruptly.BENDEROh, shit!  What're we s'posed to do
               if we hafta take a piss?CLAIRE(disgusted)
               Please...BENDERIf you gotta go...

     We hear Bender unzip his fly.BENDERYou gotta go!

     Everyone is now looking at Bender.CLAIRE(disgusted)
               Oh my God!ANDREWHey, yer not urinating in here man!BENDERDon't talk!  Don't talk!  It makes
               it crawl back up!ANDREWYou whip it out and you're dead
               before the first drop hits the
               floor!

     Bender gasps mockingly.BENDERYou're pretty sexy when you get
               angry...grrr!

     He turns to Brian.BENDERHey, homeboy...

     Brian points at himself with his pen.BENDER...why don't you go close that door.
               We'll get the prom queen--
               impregnated!

     Claire turns and glares at him.ANDREWHey!

     Bender ignores him.ANDREWHey!BENDERWhat?ANDREWIf I lose my temper, you're totalled
               man!BENDERTotally?ANDREWTotally!CLAIRE(to Bender)
               Why don't you just shut up!  Nobody
               here is interested!ANDREWReally!

               Buttface!BENDERWell hey Sporto!  What'd you do to
               get in here?  Forget to wash your
               jock?BRIAN(nervous)
               Uh, excuse me, fellas?  I think we
               should just write our papers...ANDREW(to Bender)
               Look, just because you live in here
               doesn't give you the right to be a
               pain in the ass...so knock it off!

     Bender mockingly registers pain in his face.BENDERIt's a free country...CLAIRE(to Andrew)
               He's just doing it to get a rise out
               of you!  Just ignore him...BENDER(to Claire)
               Sweets...you couldn't ignore me if
               you tried!

     Claire rolls her eyes.BENDERSo...so!
                    (to Andrew and Claire)
               Are you guys like boyfriend/girl-
               friend?

               you slip her the hot...beef...
               injection?

     Claire and Andrew turn to face Bender, both furious.CLAIRE(screams)
               Go to hell!ANDREW(screams)
               Enough!CUT TO:7. INT. VERNON'S OFFICE - DAYWe see Vernon in his office.VERNON(yells)
               Hey!  What's going on in there?
                    (to himself)
               Smug little pricks!CUT TO:8. INT. LIBRARY - DAYThey all look at each other.  Andrew turns away from
     Bender.ANDREW(to himself)
               Scumbag!

     Bender stands up and walks over to the railing.  He sits
     on it.BENDERWhat do you say we close that door.
               We can't have any kind of party
               with Vernon checking us out every
               few seconds.BRIANWell, you know the door's s'posed to
               stay open...BENDERSo what?ANDREWSo why don't you just shut up!
               There's four other people in here
               you know...BENDERGod, you can count.  See!  I knew
               you had to be smart to be a...a
               wrestler.ANDREWWho the hell are you to judge
               anybody anyway?CLAIREReally...ANDREWYou know, Bender...you don't even
               count.  I mean if you disappeared
               forever it wouldn't make any
               difference.  You may as well not
               even exist at this school.

     Bender probably is upset at this and he pauses a moment
     before speaking.  He doesn't let his emotions out,
     however.BENDERWell...I'll just run right out and
               join the wrestling team.

     Andrew and Claire look at each other and laugh at
     Bender.BENDER(to Claire)
               Maybe the prep club too!  Student
               council...ANDREWNo, they wouldn't take you.BENDERI'm hurt.CLAIREYou know why guys like you knock
               everything...BENDER(to himself)
               Oh, this should be stunning...CLAIREIt's 'cause you're afraid.BENDER(with mock enthusiasm)
               Oh, God!  You ritchies are so smart,
               that's exactly why I'm not heavy in
               activities!CLAIREYou're a big coward!

     Brian feels left out.BRIAN(to no one imparticular)
               I'm in the math club...CLAIRESee you're afraid that they won't
               take you.  You don't belong so you
               just have to dump all over it...BENDERWell...it wouldn't have anything to
               do with you activities people being
               assholes...now would it?CLAIREWell you wouldn't know...You don't
               even know any of us.BENDERWell, I don't know any lepers
               either, but I'm not gonna run out
               and join one of their fucking clubs.ANDREWHey let's watch the mouth, huh?

     Brian again feels he needs to contribute.BRIANI'm in the physics club too...BENDER(to Claire)
               S'cuse me a sec...
                    (to Brian)
               What are you babbling about?BRIANWell, what I said was...I'm in the
               math club, the Latin club and the
               physics club...physics club.

     Bender nods and turns to Claire.BENDERHey...Cherry...do you belong to the
               physics club?CLAIREThat's an academic club...BENDERSo?CLAIRESo...academic clubs aren't the same
               as other kinds of clubs.BENDEROh, but to dorks like him...

     Bender points at Brian.BENDER...they are.
                    (to Brian)
               What do you guys do in your club?BRIANIn physics, um, we ah, we talk about
               physics...about properties of physics.BENDERSo it's sorta social...demented and
               sad, but social.  Right?BRIANYeah, well, I guess you could
               consider it a social situation.  I
               mean there are other children in my
               club and uh, at the end of the year
               we have, um, you know, a big
               banquet, at the, uh, at the Hilton.BENDERYou load up, you party...BRIANWell, no, we get dressed up...I

               high.CLAIRE(to Bender)
               Only burners like you get high...BRIANAnd, uh, I didn't have any shoes.
               So I had to borrow my dad's.  It
               was kinda weird 'cause my mom doesn't
               like me to wear other people's
               shoes.  And, uh, my cousin Kent...my
               cousin Kendall from, uh, Indiana...
               He got high once and you know, he
               started eating like really weird
               foods.  And uh, and then he just
               felt like he didn't belong anywhere.
               You know, kinda like, you know
               "Twilight Zone" kinda.CLAIRE(laughs)
                    (to Bender)
               Sounds like you...ANDREWLook, you guys keep up your talking
               and Vernon's gonna come right in

               Oh and wouldn't that be a bite...

     Bender lets out a moan of fake agony.BENDERMissing a whole wrestling meet!ANDREWWell you wouldn't know anything
               about it, faggot!  You never competed
               in your whole life!BENDER(with mock hurt)
               Oh, I know...I feel all empty inside
               because of it.  I have such a deep
               admiration for guys that roll around
               on the floor with other guys!ANDREWAhhh...you'd never miss it.  You
               don't have any goals.BENDEROh, but I do!ANDREWYeah?BENDERI wanna be just--like--you!  I
               figure all I need's a labotamy and
               some tights!

     Brian becomes interested.BRIANYou wear tights?ANDREW(to Brian)
               No I don't wear tights, I wear the
               required uniform...BRIANTights...ANDREW(defensive)
               Shut up!

     They hear Vernon moving around out in the hall so Bender
     quickly comes and sits in the chair between Claire and
     Andrew.  He folds his hands on the table.
     Vernon goes back into his office.  Bender laughs and
     gets up.  He starts walking towards the double doors
     that separate the library from the hallway.BRIANYou know there's not s'posed to be
               any monkey business!

     Bender turns and points at Brian.BENDER(in a stern voice)
               Young man...have you finished your
               paper?

     Bender turns back away and goes to the door.  He looks
     around cautiously and removes a screw from the door.CLAIREWhat are you gonna do?ANDREWDrop dead, I hope!CUT TO:9. INT. HALLWAY - DAYWe see Vernon getting a drink at the fountain. He stands

               picture this, you're there with all
               the sports.  I know exactly what
               you'd do, you'd say hi to him and
               when he left you'd cut him all up

               were walking down the hall together.
               They'd laugh their asses off and
               you'd probably tell them you were
