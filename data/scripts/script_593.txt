  A CHILD'S SHOUT makes him LIFT his head to see: a LITTLE
  BLONDE BOY crouching, back towards us, watching the tide eat
  a SANDCASTLE. A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL joins the boy. The Bearded
  Man tries to call them, but they RUN OFF, FACES UNSEEN. HeCOLLAPSES.The barrel of a rifle ROLLS the Bearded Man onto his back. A
  JAPANESE SECURITY GUARD looks down at him, then calls up the
  beach to a colleague leaning against a JEEP. Behind them is a
  cliff, and on top of that, a JAPANESE CASTLE.INT. ELEGANT DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - LATERThe Security Guard waits as an ATTENDANT speaks to an ELDERLY
  JAPANESE MAN sitting at the dining table, back to us.ATTENDANT(in Japanese)
           He was delirious. But he asked for
           you by name. And...
               (to the Security Guard)
           Show him.SECURITY GUARD(in Japanese)
           He was carrying nothing but this...

  He puts a HANDGUN on the table. The Elderly Man keeps eating.SECURITY GUARD...and this.

  The Security Guard places a SMALL PEWTER CONE alongside the
  gun. The Elderly Man STOPS eating. Picks up the cone.ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN(in Japanese)
           Bring him here. And some food.INT. SAME - MOMENTS LATERThe Elderly Man watches the Bearded Man WOLF down his food.
  He SLIDES the handgun down the table towards him.ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN(in English)
           Are you here to kill me?

  The Bearded Man glances up at him, then back to his food.2.The Elderly Japanese Man picks up the cone between thumb and
  forefinger.ELDERLY JAPANESE MANI know what this is.

  He SPINS it onto a table- it CIRCLES gracefully across the
  polished ebony... a SPINNING TOP.ELDERLY JAPANESE MANI've seen one before. Many, many
          years ago...

  The Elderly Japanese Man STARES at the top mesmerized.ELDERLY JAPANESE MANIt belonged to a man I met in a
          half-remembered dream...

  MOVE IN on the GRACEFULLY SPINNING TOP...ELDERLY JAPANESE MANA man possessed of some radical
          notions...

The Elderly Japanese Man STARES, remembering...COBB (V.O.)What's the most resilient parasite?CUT TO:INT. SAME ELEGANT DINING ROOM - NIGHT (YEARS EARLIER)The speaker, COBB, is 35, handsome, tailored. A young
Japanese man, SAITO, eats as he listens.COBBA bacteria? A virus?

Cobb gestures at their feast with his wine glass-COBBAn intestinal worm?

Saito's fork pauses, mid-air. Cobb GRINS. A third man is at
the table- ARTHUR. He jumps in to save the pitch-ARTHURWhat Mr. Cobb is trying to say-COBBAn idea.

Saito looks at Cobb, curious.3.COBBResilient, highly contagious. Once
          an idea's taken hold in the brain
          it's almost impossible to
          eradicate. A person can cover it
          up, ignore it- but it stays there.SAITOBut surely-to forget...?COBBInformation, yes. But an idea?
          Fully formed, understood? That
          sticks...
              (taps forehead)
          In there, somewhere.SAITOFor someone like you to steal?ARTHURYes. In the dream state, conscious
          defenses are lowered and your
          thoughts become vulnerable to
          theft. It's called extraction.COBBBut, Mr. Saito, we can train your
          subconscious to defend itself from
          even the most skilled extractor.SAITOHow can you do that?COBBBecause I am the most skilled
          extractor. I know how to search
          your mind and find your secrets. I
          know the tricks, and I can teach
          them to your subconscious so that
          even when you're asleep, your guard
          is never down.

Cobb leans forwards. Holding Saito's gaze.COBBBut if I'm going to help you, you
          have to be completely open to me.
          I'll need to know my way around
          your thoughts better than your
          wife, your analyst, anyone.
              (gestures around)
          If this is a dream and you've got a
          safe full of secrets, I need to
          know what's in that safe. For this
          to work, you have to let me in.4.Saito gives this a flicker of a smile. Rises. A BODYGUARD
opens double doors which give onto a LAVISH PARTY.SAITOGentlemen. Enjoy your evening as I
          consider your proposal.

They watch Saito leave. Arthur turns to Cobb, worried-ARTHURHe knows.

Cobb motions silence. A TREMOR starts, they steady their
glasses, Cobb glances at his watch- THE SECOND HAND ISFROZEN.ARTHURWhat's going on up there?

And we-CUT TO:FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY (FEELS LIKE DIFFERENT TIME)Cobb, ASLEEP, SITTING IN A CHAIR AT THE END OF A STEAMING
BATH. The chair is up on a cabinet- the bottom of the legs
level with the rim of the tub.

A sweating man (40's) watches over Cobb. This is NASH. A
distant EXPLOSION rumbles through the room. Nash moves to the
window, parts the curtains. Outside: a CHAOTIC DEVELOPING-WORLD
CITY- the street filled with RIOTERS- SMASHING, BURNING.

Nash checks Cobb's left wrist: above his watch, tape holds
TWO THIN YELLOW TUBES in place. Nash looks at Cobb's watch-THE SECOND HAND CRAWLS UNNATURALLY SLOWLY.Nash follows the tubes to a SILVER BRIEFCASE at Arthur's
feet: ARTHUR IS ASLEEP in an armchair. Tubes connect the
briefcase to Arthur's wrist.

Nash follows another set of tubes from the briefcase to where
they pass under the door to the bedroom. Through the crack of
the door, Nash sees SAITO ASLEEP on the bed, tubes running to
his wrist. BOOM- a closer EXPLOSION, and we-CUT TO:INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY (FEELS LIKE DIFFERENT TIME)Nash, ASLEEP. Head ROCKING AGAINST THE WINDOW as the trainBUMPS OVER A ROUGH PIECE OF TRACK.5.A Japanese Man, TODASHI (18) watches Nash nervously. He
checks Nash's wrist: TWO YELLOW TUBES CONNECT NASH WITH THREEOTHER SLEEPING MEN IN THE COMPARTMENT: COBB, ARTHUR, SAITO.Todashi checks his watch: THE SECOND HAND TICKS IN REAL TIME.
Another TRAIN PASSES in the opposite direction with a MIGHTY
WHUMP- Todashi's eyes FLY to Nash's sleeping face-

NASH JERKS WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRAIN, and we-CUT TO:INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUSAnother EXPLOSION- Nash CHECKS the sleeping Cobb and we-CUT TO:EXT. ROOFTOP TERRACES, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHTA LOW TREMOR RUMBLES THROUGH THE CASTLE. Cobb and Arthur
steady themselves against the wooden rail. Several TILES and
pieces of MASONRY fall. Below them a BLACK SEA churns. Other
GUESTS wander the massive terraces.ARTHURSaito knows. He's playing with us.COBBI can get it here. The
          information's in the safe- he
          looked right at it when I mentioned
          secrets.

Arthur nods. Then spots someone over Cobb's shoulder.ARTHURWhat's she doing here, Cobb?

Cobb turns to see a beautiful woman, elegantly dressed,
staring out at the sea. This is MAL. Cobb watches her.COBBYou just get to your room. I'll
          take care of the rest.ARTHURSee that you do. We're here to
          work.

Arthur brushes past Mal, shaking his head. She nears Cobb.
Looks out at the DROP. The WIND WHIPS HER HAIR-MALIf I jumped, would I survive?6.COBBWith a clean dive, perhaps. Mal,
          why are you here?

She turns to look at him. Amused.MALI thought you might be missing
          me...

She smiles. He leans in, mesmerized.COBBI am. But I can't trust you
          anymore.

She stares up at him, inviting.MALSo what?INT. BEDROOM SUITE, JAPANESE CASTLE - MOMENTS LATERMal sips champagne as she studies a painting by Francis
Bacon.MALLooks like Arthur's taste.

Cobb is looking down through the window at the GUARDS
patrolling the castle at ground level.COBBActually, Mr. Saito is partial to
          postwar British painters.

He turns to Mal, donning a pair of black leather gloves.COBBWould you sit down?

Mal lowers herself gracefully into a leather wingback chair.
Cobb approaches, pulls out a length of BLACK ROPE and kneels
at Mal's feet. She looks down at him.MALTell me...

Cobb TIES the rope around the CHAIR LEGS.MALDo the children miss me?

Cobb pauses. He lets his gloved fingers lightly touch Mal's
ankle. He looks up at her.7.COBBYou can't imagine.

Mal looks away, uncomfortable. Cobb gets to his feet, letting
out the rope as he moves back to the window.MALWhat're you doing?

Cobb tosses the rope out-COBBGetting some air.

He tugs on the rope, testing. The weight of the chair, with
Mal on it, holds.COBBStay seated. Please.

And with that, he JUMPS. Mal considers the open window.EXT. JAPANESE CASTLE WALL - CONTINUOUSCobb RAPPELS down the wall, darting past windows. He stops at
a particular one. Gets out a glass cutter-

Suddenly he starts DROPPING-INT. BEDROOM SUITE, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUSThe EMPTY CHAIR SLIDES across the floor- WEDGES under the
window-EXT. JAPANESE CASTLE WALL - CONTINUOUSCobb JOLTS to a stop 15 ft. lower. He looks up at the bedroom
window. Shakes his head. Starts climbing back.INT. KITCHEN, JAPANESE CASTLE - MOMENTS LATERCobb drops silently from the window into the darkened
kitchen. He pulls a PISTOL from his belt, screwing a SILENCER
onto the barrel as he GLIDES across the room.INT. HALL, JAPANESE CASTLE-CONTINUOUSCobb SLIPS through the shadows towards a GUARD stationed at
the head of a GRAND STAIRCASE...

The Guard HEARS something- TURNS- PEERS into the shadows...

Cobb FLASHES out of the shadows, silenced pistol up, AIMING-8.PHHT- head shot- the Guard starts to drop... but Cobb is
already there to CATCH him, sliding on his knees and lowering
the Guard SILENTLY to the floor.INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUSCobb moves to a PAINTING. With practiced hands he removes it
from the wall, revealing a SAFE. Cobb spins the dial, pulls
it OPEN, GRABS an envelope from within, stuffs it into his
waistband, where there is already an IDENTICAL ENVELOPE.

LIGHTS COME ON. Cobb freezes.SAITO (O.S.)Turn around.

Cobb turns. At the far end of the room: Saito. Next to him is
Mal, gun in hand. She smiles at Cobb.MALThe gun, Dom.

Cobb doesn't move. Mal motions outside- two GUARDS drag
Arthur into the room. Mal puts the gun to his head.MALPlease.

Cobb slowly places his gun at his end of the long table, then
SLIDES it along the polished ebony. It comes to rest HALFWAY
down the length or the table.SAITONow the envelope, Mr. Cobb.

Cobb reaches into his waistband, removes ONE of the
envelopes, SLIDES it along the table. Steps back, hands
raised.COBBDid she tell you, or have you known
          all along?SAITOThat you're here to steal from me?
              (beat)
          Or that we're actually asleep?

Arthur gives Cobb an I-told-you-so look.SAITOI want to know who your employer
          is.

Mal COCKS the gun at Arthur's temple.9.COBBNo point threatening him in a
          dream.MALThat depends on what you're
          threatening. Killing him would just
          wake him up... but pain? Pain is in
          the mind...

Mal LOWERS the gun and SHOOTS Arthur in the leg- Arthur
drops, SCREAMING- Mal looks at Cobb, cold.MALAnd, judging by the decor, we're in
          your mind, aren't we, Arthur?

Cobb watches Arthur's PAIN. Mal aims at Arthur's other leg...

Cobb SPRINGS for the table, SKIDDING along its polished
surface- he GRABS his gun- SHOOTS ARTHUR BETWEEN THE EYES-

Arthur DROPS- the room starts to SHUDDER in a MASSIVE
EARTHQUAKE- Cobb SPRINGS for the door- Arthur's eyes stare at
the ceiling, DEAD, and we-CUT TO:INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - DAYArthur's EYES OPEN as he WAKES IN THE ARMCHAIR- he GRABS at
the tubes at his wrist, YANKING them free-NASHWhat're you doing?! It's too soon-

FLUID spurts from the tubes as Arthur STRUGGLES with the
SILVER CASE on the bathroom floor.ARTHURI know! We have to reconnect the
          loop before they wake up!

Arthur grabs the case and pushes through the door to the
bedroom- following the tubes to where they meet Saito's wrist-
SAITO LIES ON THE BED ASLEEP. Saito STIRS and we-CUT TO:INT. JAPANESE CASTLE CORRIDOR - NIGHTCobb LURCHES towards the stairs, as all around him the

and a finger to his lips, gesturing silence...INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUSNash puts his hand on Cobb's forehead and PUSHES HIM
BACKWARDS- as Cobb starts to FALL BACKWARDS in the chair we
are in SLOW MOTION, and we-CUT TO:INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHTCobb, full speed, picks himself up, scrambling to read the

Saito SMASHES into the room, KNOCKING Nash down- Cobb
LAUNCHES himself out of the tub, FLYING dripping wet across
the room to SLAM Saito against the door- the gun DROPS,
Cobb's fist CONNECTS with Saito's jaw and the struggle is
over.INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATERCobb, wet but composed, sits, turning Saito's gun in his
hand. Nash holds Saito's arms behind him. Outside, the sounds
of RIOTING grow louder.COBBYou came prepared.SAITOI bring the gun because not even my
          head of security knows this
          apartment. How did you find it?

Arthur, at the window, looks out at the WORSENING VIOLENCE.COBBHard for a man in your position to
          keep a love nest totally secret...
          particularly when there's a married
          woman involved.SAITOShe would never...COBBAnd yet, here we are.

Saito is silent.COBBWith a dilemma.SAITOYou got what you came for.COBBNot quite. The key piece of
          information wasn't there, was it,

pulls out an MP3 player and we-CUT TO:INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAYSaito's eyes are on the floor.COBBYou held something back because you
          knew what we were up to...

Cobb uses the barrel of the gun to raise Saito's chin.COBBSo why let us in at all?

Saito smiles, defiant. VIOLENT NOISES echo up the stairway...SAITOAn audition.COBBAudition for what?SAITOIt doesn't matter. You failed.COBBI extracted all the information you
          had in there.SAITOBut your deception was readily
          apparent.

And we-CUT TO:INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAYTodashi opens the SILVER BRIEFCASE, revealing the complex
mechanism of syringes and controllers- FOUR CONTROLLERSDISPLAY COUNTDOWNS.14.Todashi waits for the first countdown to hit "30," then HITS

RAISES the volume...

"Non, je ne regrette rien," and we-CUT TO:INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAYIn the distant background, strange MASSIVE low-end MUSICAL
start, sounding like DISTANT HORNS...SAITOSo leave me and go.COBBYou know the corporation who hired
          us won't accept failure. We won't
          last two days...

The DISTANT, SLOWED-DOWN MUSIC is becoming LOUDER, as are the
SHOUTS coming up the stairs. Arthur looks at his watch, itsSLOW SECOND TICKING MARKS TIME WITH THE MASSIVE MUSIC.ARTHURCome on, Cobb.COBBSo now I have to do this the old-
          fashioned way-

Cobb GRABS SAITO AND PUTS HIS HEAD TO THE FLOOR, gun pressed
into his cheek. Saito looks into Cobb's eyes- sees he will
pull the trigger. Saito BLINKS, looks away in shame-

When he NOTICES SOMETHING. And starts LAUGHING.SAITOI've always hated this carpet.

Cobb's eyes flick to the carpet and back.SAITOIt's stained and frayed in such
          distinctive ways...

projections STARING at her.ARIADNEWhy are they looking at me?COBBBecause you're changing things. My
          subconscious feels that someone

          more you change things, the quicker
          the projections converge on you.ARIADNEConverge?COBBThey feel the foreign nature of the

They walk along the street to where it joins the next
gravitational plane. They step up onto the different plane
and walk down the street towards a river. As Ariadne
approaches, steps emerge from the flagstone, and she leads
Cobb up onto a small jetty. As she concentrates, pillars
emerge and a BRIDGE starts to telescope out from the jetty.
They step onto it as it grows. Cobb is impressed.COBBIt's beautiful... but if you keep

Cobb turns from Mal. Looks at Ariadne.COBBI'm not. Saito is dead by now. That
          means he's here. I have to stay
          here and find him.

Ariadne removes Fischer's gag- pulls him up, onto the rail.
Cobb looks back at Mal.COBBI can't stay here to be with her
          because she's not real.

Mal looks at Cobb, furious.MALNot real? I'm the only thing you do
          believe in anymore. Here-doesn't
          this feel real, Dom?

She STABS him in the chest- Cobb WHEEZES- GASPING, looking at
Mal-139.COBBI wish you were. But I couldn't
          make you real. I'm not capable of
          imagining you in all your
          complexity and... perfection. As
          you really were. You're the best I
          can do. And you're not real.

Mal pulls the knife and moves to STRIKE again-ARIADNENo!

A SHOT rings out, Mal GRABS her shoulder- Cobb turns to
Ariadne, who is pointing Cobb's gun.COBBWhat're you doing?ARIADNEImprovising.

Fischer tries to hold IT, he SHAKES his son's hand away...

He is reaching for the SAFE next to his bed. His fingers
fumble at the keypad, he can't open it. His son pushes
5,2,8,4,9,1 into the keypad. Opens it. Inside the safe is the
WILL. And beside it is a HOMEMADE PINWHEEL, clearly made by a
child. By Fischer. He takes it out, MARVELING at it. He turns
to his father, but his father is dead.

the polished surface of the table...COBBThat this world is not real.145.The top IS STILL SPINNING PERFECTLY, AS IF IT WILL NEVER

at him. He nods back. Then moves off...

As Cobb passes through baggage claim, he exchanges subtle
