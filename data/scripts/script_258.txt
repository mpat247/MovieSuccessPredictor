          joins in, even more shrill than the first. Finally, we hear
          the worst two words a parent can ever hear:GROGGY WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)Your turn.GROGGY MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)Fuck.INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE -- NIGHTDAVE LOCKWOOD, 30, bleary-eyed father of three, shuffles
          through his well-appointed suburban home, passing a
          grandfather clock reading 3:45. He stumbles over a TOY
          GIRAFFE -- it SQUEAKS, and Dave sleepily mumbles:DAVESorry Hank.INT. NURSERY-- NIGHTHis eyes half-open, Dave changes the diaper of his very cute,
          very insane nine month old daughter, SARAH, who screams and
          pitches about her changing table.DAVEPLEASE DON'T--Honey, that's not--
          Maybe if you--
          She snatches a tin of baby powder and swings it about like a
          mace, knocking over the diaper caddy, the wipes, the lotion --
          and dispersing a cloud of white powder all over the nursery.
          Blinded and SNEEZING, Dave manages to stay on point and
          change the diaper like Van Damme at the end of Bloodsport.DAVE (CONT'D)Can't-see ...must...persevere...
          He finishes changing Sarah, places her back in her crib, then
          picks up Sarah's twin brother, PETER, from his crib -- which
          is good because he's been SLAMMING his head against the wall.DAVE (CONT'D)Come on, buddy, we've talked about
          the head thing--
          Dave places Peter on the changing table and opens his diaper.
          It's only wet, and Dave, pleasantly relieved, reaches for a
          fresh diaper...2.Only Sarah has knocked the caddy all the way down the
          changing table...
          Holding down Peter with his left hand, Dave fully extends,
          leaning waaay over, reaching for the diaper caddy...
          It's just out of reach.. .he somehow stretches further...
          It's only when Dave glances back that he realizes that his
          head is now perfectly lined up with his son's QUIVERING ANUS.DAVE (CONT'D)Oh no.THE BABY'S BUTT-HOLE ERUPTSwith mustardy projectile stool, blasting Dave in the eyes,
          nose and open mouth. Dave remains frozen, excrement dripping
          down his face -- but, like a true dad, he does not let go of
          his squirming child...INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHTDave staggers down the hall, his hair white with baby powder,
          his face covered in poo, and a twin in each arm SCREAMING
          into each of his ears.
          He soldiers on, stoic, an unsung hero in his time...INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHTJuggling the twins in his arms, Dave wipes his face off with
          paper towels and prepares two baby bottles -- nipples,
          filters, defrosted breastmilk -- while the babies take turns
          kicking him in the balls and SCREAMING.DAVEPlease, sweetheart, not my--
          Honey, Daddy needs those--INT. DEN -- NIGHTDave sits on his couch and positions the screaming, squirming
          twins across his lap in an X pattern, plunks the bottles into
          their mouths -- and instantly the twins settle down and slurp
          away like perfect little angels.
          Dave exhales. Whew. Then he reaches for the remote control
          and turns on the TV. An old rerun of Magnum, P.I. is playing.
          Dave watches, exhausted and expressionless.3.ON SCREEN, Tom Selleck, resplendent in mustache, corduroy
          short shorts, and Hawaiian shirt, teaches a nubile CO-ED in a
          scandalous bikini how to snorkel in beautiful sun-drenched
          Waikiki. They're laughing and having a blast...
          Dave watches, detached... Then his face starts to change...MAGNUM, P.I.Is this the life you always dreamed
          of?
          Dave shakes his head, no, despair in his eyes...
          ON TV, the co-ed nods, yes, and hungrily kisses Magnum...
          Dave watches on with genuine existential longing... and soon a
          tear falls from his eye. And then another.DAVETake me with you Magnum P. I...
          Before long Dave is CRYING like a schoolgirl.DAVE (CONT'D)Please take me with you...CUT TO:MAN'S VOICE (V.0.)How are the kids?DAVE (V.0.)Terrific! Just terrific.
          We are nowINT. STEEL, KUHBACH, MCCLOUD -- LAW FIRM -- MORNINGDave, in a conservative suit and clutching a massive coffee,
          hurries down the hall with FLEMMING STEEL III, 50's, stiff,
          humorless WASPY partner of this white shoe law firm.FLEMMING STEEL IIIChildren are such a joy.DAVEAren't they? Yes. Always.
          (to passing SECRETARY)
          Good morning, Rebecca.FLEMMING STEEL IIIAny word on the Amalgamated merger?4.DAVEAll but signed.FLEMMING STEEL IIIAnd just in time for your partner
          review no less.DAVE(SMILING)Really? I hadn't noticed.FLEMMING STEEL IIII look forward to having your antic
          sense of humor in the partners'
          suite, Lockwood. It can get a touch
          dry up there.DAVEThank you, sir.FLEMMING STEEL III(re: Dave's necktie knot)
          But a double windsor? Come on, son,
          this isn't the dog track.DAVENo sir, absolutely not. So sorry.
          Dave quickly undoes his tie as Flemming turns down a hallway.
          SABRINA McARDLE, cute young paralegal, falls into step with
          Dave, stymieing laughter.SABRINA MCARDLEReally? The dog track?DAVELast week he told me my shoes were
          "dangerously Italian."SABRINA MCARDLE(laughing, handing him docs)
          Amalgamated signing statements.DAVEThanks, Sabrina.SABRINA MCARDLEHave a good one...
          She smiles and breezes back down the hallway. Dave stops and
          watches her go, lust in his eyes.5.Then he hears TSK-TSK-TSK. He looks over at his mean old
          secretary, GLADYS, 71, sitting at her desk.GLADYSFor shame, Mr. Lockwood! For shame!
          You are a married man!DAVEI have no idea what you're talking
          about, Gladys...
          Reddening, he snatches a huge pile of pink message slips and
          hurries towards his office. She follows him, scolding:GLADYSWith children.DAVEYes, thank you, I almost forgot
          about them for like two seconds...INT. DAVE'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUSDave enters his modest office; his phone is RINGING.GLADYSThe only thing that harlot needs to
          put in her mouth is a sandwich.DAVEGladys, I'm a grown man, okay?
          He angrily punches "SPEAKER" on his RINGING phone as he
          reties his tie with a more traditional knot.DAVE (CONT'D)Lockwood.
          A shrill, horribly impersonated British accent fills Dave's
          office -- as well as all of the surrounding offices.VOICE ON PHONEYES, MY DOUCHEBAG EXPLODED THISMORNING AND I'D LIKE TO SUE--!As Gladys and various CO-WORKERS turn, shocked, Dave quickly
          fumbles for the receiver and takes the call off speaker.DAVEJesus, Mitch, I'm at work--6.VOICE ON PHONEWHO'S MITCH?! THIS IS MISS ELIZAHAVERSHAM AND I AM THE VICTIM OF AFAULTY BAG OF DOUCHE!DAVEDude, how stoned are you?INTERCUT WITH:MITCH PLANKO, 30, shirtless, Dodgers hat backwards, sitting
          on a futon in his sparse white apartment, smoking a bong
          shaped like a shotgun. Beat. He drops the horrible accent:MITCHI'm pretty stoned.DAVECome on, it's 10 in the morning.MITCHDude, guess what? Great news.DAVEWhat?MITCHI found a futon on the street.DAVEThat is great news.MITCHI sort of had to fight a bum for it
          -- is that bad?DAVEKind of. Is there a reason you're
          calling or--?MITCHAre you gonna bitch out on tonight?
          You are, aren't you.
          Dave, half-listening, sits at his desk and answers emails.MITCH (CONT'D)Dodgers-Giants, dude! We haven't
          missed one of these in like 20
          years! Don't be a vajeen!DAVEDude, I'm coming--7.MITCHYou always do this! You never make
          time for your friends anymore and
          I'm sorry to be the one to tell you
          this, but people are starting to
          talk. Feelings are getting hurt.DAVEReally? Whose feelings?MITCHNot mine, because, like a samurai,
          I have trained myself to feel
          nothing except revenge and honor,
          but other people -- nameless,
          other, more sensitive people -- are
          hurt, and they think you need to
          treasure your friendships a little
          bit more.
          (exhaling massive bong rip)
          How concerned should I be that my
          new futon smells like death?DAVE(distracted, typing)
          Look, just, what time are you
          picking me up tonight?MITCHIf you bail I will rape you.DAVEDude, I get it, I'm coming--MITCHIn your eye. I will eye-rape you.REPEATEDLY--Just then there's a knock on Mitch's apartment door.VOICE AT HIS DOOR (V.0.)Mitch?MITCHShit.
          Mitch starts waving away the pot smoke.MITCH (CONT'D)Gotta go, pick you up at six--!8.STAY WITH MITCH as he quickly clicks off his iPhone, jams his
          bong under the futon, opens the window, and tries to blow the
          pot smoke out of his apartment with quick little PUFFS.MITCH (CONT'D)One sec, Dad!
          The smoke clears and Mitch jogs to the door and opens it to
          reveal his father, MITCH, SR., 60's, friendly, in a suit,
          holding a pile of mail.MITCH, SR.Hey, buddy! Your mailbox was
          spilling over.MITCHOh thanks, I always forget.
          They hug, and Mitch takes the mail and, without looking at
          it, chucks it onto a HUGE PILE OF OLD MAIL in the corner.MITCH, SR.Were you smoking marijuana in here?MITCHNo! Honestly, it's my new futon, it
          smells like illegal drugs.MITCH, SR.We've talked about this, Mitch.
          Smoke your grass on the balcony,
          okay? It's just hard for me to tell
          the other tenants they can't smoke
          in their units when my own son is
          blazing away in his, you know?MITCHYou got it, Dad.MITCH, SR.Oh hey, I saw your commercial on
          channel 9 again last night...MITCHWhich one? "Give Gonorrhea The
          Boot" or "Samir's Pet Shack Our Low
          Low Prices Are Snake-sational?"MITCH, SR.Samir's Pet Shack. It's just a
          shame you can't see your face in
          that giant ape costume.9.MITCHActually, the real shame is that
          Samir paid me in fucking organic
          bird seed, but whatever...
          He glares at several crates of BIRD SEED by the door.MITCH, SR.Well, your mother would've liked
          it. She always loved animals...(AWKWARD MOMENT)Anyway. I was just in the
          neighborhood, wanted to check in.
          How you doing, cash-wise?MITCHI'm a little tight, actually, Pops.
          Especially vis a vis, you know, the
          whole bird seed situation.MITCH, SR.Five hundred?MITCHCan you make it a grand?
          Mitch's dad smiles to hide his disappointment and hands his
          30-year-old son a roll of hundred dollar bills.MITCH, SR.You thought any more about coming
          to work for me?MITCHYeeeah...I'm not really sure I'm a
          "work" guy, you know what I mean?
          Plus, I've been getting a ton of
          auditions recently, so...MITCH, SR.Okay, well, my door is always open.MITCHThanks, pop. Bones.
          Mitch, Sr. smiles and awkwardly bumps his son's fist.MITCH (CONT'D)Batting cages next weekend?MITCH, SR.Great! See you then.10.Mitch, Sr. smiles sadly and exits. Mitch BURPS and reaches
          for his bong, having noticed none of his father's distress...DISSOLVE TO:EXT. DAVE'S HOUSE -- BRENTWOOD -- EVENINGESTABLISHING SHOTS of Dave's beautiful colonial home. Huge
          oak trees shade the lush front lawn. New Audi and BMW station
          wagons sit in the driveway. We hear WATER SPLASHING...INT. DAVE'S HOUSE -- BATHROOM -- EVENINGThe twins sit in the bath, motionless, anticipatory...DAVE (V.0.).AND THEN THE BABY-EATING MONSTEREMERGES FROM THE DEEP RAAWWWWR.Dave rises up from beside the tub, arms upraised, soap suds
          covering his face! The twins SCREAM and SPLASH, ecstatic!
          Dave tries not to laugh, but he's having too much fun...
          Behind Dave, his sweet daughter CARA, 5, sits on the closed
          toilet lid in a ballet tutu, reading her BUTTERFLY BOOK.CARADaddy daddy, which is your favorite
          butterfly, the Southern Monarch or
          the Many-Spotted Skipperling?
          Dave glances at the book as he washes the twins.DAVEOh, I'm a Many-Spotted Skipperling
          man all the way. The Southern
          Monarch is just a glorified moth.CARA(VERY SERIOUS)Yes. I tend to agree...
          Dave smiles. Then his handsome wife JAMIE, 30's, blows into
          the bathroom in a suit and starts removing her makeup.JAMIEWhat a day. Dr. Klein lost the
          twins immunization record, the
          wireless went down, and Cara got
          bullied in ballet class again.11.CARANicolette Peters keeps knocking me
          over during the battement glisse.DAVEOh, I'm sorry, sugar-bug...
          Dave looks genuinely concerned. Cara just shrugs and keeps
          reading her butterfly book. Jamie whispers to him:JAMIEWe need to remind her to keep
          striving for verbal resolution.DAVERight, of course.
          Jamie finally notices Dave's foam-covered face, and softens.JAMIEAnd how was your day, monster man?
          Before Dave can answer, the doorbell rings, DING-DONG! They
          exchange the weary smile of parents who never see each other.JAMIE (CONT'D)He's early.DAVEOf course he's early. All he does
          all day is eat hummus and
          masturbate.CUT TO:THE FRONT DOOR OPENINGto reveal MITCH in shades, fedora, and a Dodgers jersey.
          Jamie, holding Cara, lets him in.MITCHWhatup bitches!JAMIE(LAUGHING)Really?
          He takes Cara and playfully -- and incredibly recklessly --
          flips her in the air.MITCHHow's my favorite ballerina?!12.CARAI'm good! Are you coming to my
          recital on Thursday?!MITCHOh no, honey, the only style of
          dancing I support is exotic...
          He plunks her on the floor and blows intoDAVE'S AMAZING KITCHENreplete with granite counter tops, built-in appliances, fresh
          flowers, and bowls teeming with fruit. Mitch beelines for the
          Subzero fridge and opens it: it's stocked. His eyes alight.MITCHJesus Christ you could feed Africa
          with this fridge...
          As Jamie starts prepping a salad across the kitchen, Mitch
          raids the fridge, packing his cargo pants with kid's snacks,
          bagels, yogurts, juice boxes, everything.MITCH (CONT'D)These leftovers from Morton's?JAMIEOh no, hon, those are super old--
          Too late -- Mitch is already eating the very old steak.MITCHChimichurri. score.
          As Mitch chews, he eyes Jamie chopping vegetables.MITCH (CONT'D)You look hot by the way, Jame.
          Jamie laughs but clearly doesn't mind the flirtation.JAMIEThanks... sort of...?MITCHNo really. I never would've guessed
          twins.JAMIEAnnnd that's probably enough--13.MITCHIs Dave still meeting your needs
          sexually?
          Jamie just laughs, shaking her head, unbelievable.MITCH (CONT'D)Oh, did I tell you I ran into Miss
          Hickam last week at Starbucks?JAMIEOur old kindergarten teacher?!MITCHYeah. She always liked Dave better
          than me...JAMIEHoney, everyone likes Dave better
          than you.MITCHFair enough. Anyway, I tried to get
          her number, but she goes "I don't
          date former students," so I go,
          "great, do you fuck former
          students?" and then she calls me a
          "potty-mouth degenerate" and runs
          out without her coffee. So I got a
          free venti macchiato, which is cool-DAVE (O.S.)Bathed, changed and in their Pis.
          Mitch turns to see Dave in khakis and a buttondown, entering
          the kitchen with the freshly bathed twins. Mitch grins:MITCHAwww! Come to Uncle Mitch...
          Dave hands the twins to Mitch, and they COO, impishly cute.MITCH (CONT'D)Oh my God, they smell like heaven
          had sex with a dryer sheet.
          (loudly to babies)HI! WHAT'S YOUR NAME?! WHICH ONEARE YOU?!(they just GURGLE)
          Why can't they talk yet? Are they
          retarded or something?14.JAMIE(LAUGHING)What?! No! They're fine!MITCHReally? The one on the left looks a
          little downsy.(JAMIE GASPS)Kidding! Kidding.

          A little bit though, right?
          Ignoring him, Dave fastens the twins into their Bouncy Seats.DAVEI'll be back right after the game,

          drink alone?DAVEYeah, well, you're driving, so...
          Mitch shrugs and slides the spare beer into his chest pocket.15.MITCHOh, dude: great news.DAVEYou found another futon?MITCHThat's awesome, because I'm made of
          emotional Teflon and words can't
          hurt me anymore. No: I auditioned
          for a major movie role yesterday.DAVENice. What movie?MITCHIt's called Busted Dreams 4. It's
          about a renegade coroner who reads
          minds named Jake Action. It's like
          a sexy Mentalist.DAVESounds cool.MITCHYeah, I read for the part of Steve
          Action, Jake's troubled younger
          brother with a secret, and I
          fucking killed it. I cried like
          five times during the audition and
          it's a fucking action movie. Plus
          I'm the spitting image of the dude
          who plays Jake Action, so...DAVEI hope you get it, man.MITCHYeah, it could be my Raging Bull.

          Mitch registers the desperation in his married friend's eyes.MITCHOkay, well, you're in luck, because
          Tatiana is stupid fucking hot.
          Beautiful face, legs a mile long,

          E's, which means like 20 plus
          pounds of breastmeat -- yeah, it's
          almost too much for one man to
          handle. Thank God I'm the son of a
          butcher and have strong hands and
          wrists. Anyway, she walks in
          wearing this tight black dress, and
          you know what she says to me?
          Dave shakes his head, on the edge of his bar stool.MITCH (CONT'D)Nothing. Because all Tatiana wants
          to do at 3 in the morning is fucky
          fucky rubber ducky!
          Dave drunkenly slaps him ten, barely making hand-contact.MITCH (CONT'D)And look, I'm not one to kiss and
          tell...
          (downing another shot)
          but this chick is insatiable. She
          wants it in every position:
          Missionary, wheelbarrow, Reverse
          Wheelbarrow, Assassin--DAVEI don't even know what those are!MITCHNo one does! It gets so intense
          that my nose starts bleeding. Yeah,
          so I'm bleeding all over this chick
          and she's fucking digging it.(MORE)19.MITCH (CONT'D)It's like some weird Dracula Anne
          Rice shit, and I'm fading in and
          out of consciousness, and then,
          when it's all over, she turns to me
          and goes: "Tuesday night I'm coming
          back and we're really going to
          fuck."
          Dave just stares at him, glassy-eyed, drunk, emotional.DAVEThat is maybe the single greatest
          story I've ever heard in my life.MITCHAh, it's not always like that...DAVEI don't know why...I don't know why
          I've always been in such a rush,
          you know?MITCHWHAT(BURRRRP)do you mean?DAVEYou remember me in high school, I
          was always so focussed on getting
          into a good college, then when I
          got to college, I was so focussed
          on getting into a good law school,
          then in law school I was just
          trying to land a job at a good
          firm, then Jamie and I got married
          and we had Cara right away-- I just
          feel like and I missed out on all
          the fun stuff, you know? The sex,
          the drugs, the bad choices, and now
          it's too late. I blew it. I pissed
          away my 20's, and now I'm staring
          down the barrel a seriously boring
          life.MITCHOh come on, Jamie is hot!DAVENo, I know--MITCHI really want to have sex with her!20.DAVEWait, what?MITCHAnd your kids are adorable! They're
          like fun little puppies that talk!
          The bill comes. Dave pulls out a wad of cash, throws it on
          the table, and stumbles for the door. Mitch lifts one of
          Dave's twenties off the table and follows him out...EXT. SPORTSBAR -- CONTINUOUSThey stumble down the dark Hollywood street together...DAVEDon't get me wrong, I love my kids,
          I do, I would take a bullet for
          them, but...remember that heroin
          addict you dated?MITCHTara? Or Rena? Or Rachel?DAVEJesus, how many heroin addicts have
          you dated?MITCHIt's a national scourge, dude.DAVEAnyway. Having kids is like dating
          a heroin addict, only instead of
          dating them, they move into your
          house for 18 years. They're
          laughing one second and crying the
          next and then they're trying to
          kill themselves in your bathroom
          for no reason. They're mean and
          selfish and they burn through all
          your money and they steal your shit
          and they break everything and they
          stay up all night and they listen
          to really shitty music and the
          dirty secret is, no one actually
          likes kids.MITCHOh come on, you don't mean that--21.DAVENo! It's true. Everyone pretends to
          like kids because if you don't you
          look like a huge dick. It's like
          Drew Barrymore or jazz. No one
          actually likes them, but if you say
          that out loud, everybody hates you.MITCHDude, I love Drew Barrymore -- have
          you seen Boys on the Side?
          They weave across a LARGE PLAZA, stumbling for Mitch's car.DAVEI'm just saying: don't fuck up your
          life like I did, okay?MITCHWhat are you talking about? You've
          got it all! You've got a huge house
          full of food and furniture -- shit,
          your TV is bigger than my car! You
          have a great job, you make a shit-
          ton of money, and people respect
          you, man! My last job involved an
          ape costume -- do you know what
          that does to a man?
          Dave waves him off, not really hearing him. But Mitch is
          sincere, heartfelt:MITCH (CONT'D)Plus you've got a hot, extremely
          fuckable wife who cooks and cleans
          and takes care of all your needs!
          It's like having a really hot mom
          who you can also have sex with!DAVEWait, what--?MITCHAlso you're never lonely, you
          always have someone to talk to
          about your day, plus you get to do
          all the fun gay couple stuff like
          go to wine country! You think
          single guys can go to wine
          country?! No way! They won't even
          let us in! You're living the dream,

          with strange new women and maybe
          also with Sabrina if she's single
          and I want to wake up at noon and
          smoke weed all afternoon and I want
          to not think about the needs of
          four other people 24 hours a day
          and I want to start reading a novel
          and actually finish it and I want
          to take a solid shit because I'm
          not constantly stressed out and I
          want to learn how to rollerblade
          and also I really want to pee...MITCHYeah, me too...
          They look around the plaza, and their eyes land on the HUGE
          FOUNTAIN in the middle; a GREEK GODDESS sits atop it.MITCH (CONT'D)Fountain?DAVEBingo.
          They stumble over to the fountain, unzip their pants, and,
          leaning on each other, begin peeing into it. Mitch glances up
          at the GREEK GODDESS METIS. She scowls down at them.MITCHThis chick does not look happy.DAVEMaybe she has three kids and a job
          she hates.MITCHDude, enough already.DAVEI'm just saying...I envy your life.MITCHAnd that's what's so fucked,

          way. Very thick and confident.MITCHThank you. Yours is very steamy.DAVEThank you. My urologist says I run
          a little warm.

          a body lies in Dave's bed, SNORING away. Then we hearTHE TWINS CRYINGfollowed by what is unequivocally Mitch's patter -- and hisFAMILY-FRIENDLY LANGUAGE:MITCHWhose fucking baby is that...?
          A hand emerges and fumbles on the night stand.MITCH (CONT'D)And where the fuck is my bong?
          He groggily rises from the sheets -- only it's not Mitch.
          It's Dave. His body, his face, everything.
          Yup, you got it: the single auy and the married guy have
          switched bodies. We will refer to them by their "brain
          names," thus while this hungover dude definitely looks like
          Dave, inside he's Mitch, so that's what we'll call him. The
          actors, of course, will remain in their bodies.
          Mitch doesn't know any of this yet.MITCH (CONT'D)Why are there so many fucking
          pillows...?
          He rolls over to see Jamie, sitting up in bed, pulling her
          breasts out of her tank top, getting ready to nurse the
          twins. Mitch launches out of bed, suddenly very awake.MITCH (CONT'D)WHOA! WHOA! WHAT THE FUCK, JAME?!She starts breast-feeding the babies, confused.JAMIEWhat? What's your problem?
          Mitch shields his eyes with his hands, shocked and disgusted.25.MITCHOh my god that is so gross! Put

          Dave stops, noticing that he's in Mitch's empty apartment.DAVEWhy am I in your sad apartment--MITCH (O.S.)The door, dude! Open the door!DAVEFine, Jesus, relax--
          Dave opens the door to see himself standing there.DAVE (CONT'D)What the fuck is this...?
          Dave backpedals, terrified, as Mitch blows inside, furious.MITCHI knew it!DAVE(FREAKING OUT)Who the hell are you?! And why do
          you look like me?!
          Mitch angles Dave over to the mirror on the otherwise barren
          wall-and Dave sees he's in Mitch's body... Stunned, he
          slowly touches his new face... his new hair. . .his new body...27.DAVE (CONT'D)Oh my God...MITCHI know, dude.DAVEI'm a fucking loser...MITCHWait, what?
          Dave spins, completely awake now:DAVEHow the fuck did this happen?!MITCHHow should I know?! Has this ever

          clothes, and get to set -- all the

          The execs furiously race out of the conference room, all of
          them reaching for their cell phones. War has been declared.
          The lawyers hurry after the clients, fruitlessly trying to
          coax them back to the table.

          Steel III grabs his arm, furious.FLEMMING STEEL IIIRight now you need to give me one
          reason not to fire you.

          good plan, is it.FLEMMING STEEL IIISon, what you've just said to me is
          highly illegal. You could go to
          jail for a very long time just for
          suggesting it...MITCH(SWEATING)We're lawyers! We're above the law!38.FLEMMING STEEL IIII must say, I've never seen this
          side of you before, Lockwood. I

          Flemming Steel III hurries off. Mitch exhales, holy shit...DISSOLVE TO:EXT. VAN NUYS -- RANCH HOUSE -- DAYDave nervously pulls up to a RANCH HOUSE in the Fiero,
          reading the address off his iPhone. Several crew trucks are
          parked out front, and PA's with headsets loiter about.
          Dave gets out wearing an ironed buttondown shirt tucked into
          khakis. He self-consciously untucks half his shirt, trying to
          look "cooler," as he approaches a nearby P.A.DAVEYo, Mitch Planko is here. Where the
          fuck is Hair & Makeup?P.A.(POINTING)Um, trailer 3.. ?DAVEThat's so real.

          undone, sits in the makeup chair, getting his hair styled. He
          studies the script, confused. Then a P.A. hurries in.39.P.A.I'm here to take you to set. Is
          there anything I can get you?
          Vitamin water, Pelegrino?DAVENo thanks. Hey, what does it mean

          candles. The P.A. unbuttons Dave's shirt even further and
          starts smearing his chest and face with Crisco oil.
          Just then, the fat balding director, VALTAN -- just Valtan --
          from some ethnically cleansed Balkan state, 50's, blows in.VALTANMore oil! Make him shiny like fish!40.DAVEExcuse me, are you in charge here?

          that shit anymore.
          Dave's mouth opens, but nothing comes out. A P.A. guides him
          out of the room. He's still in a trance...VALTANANNNND ACTION:Dave stands there, frozen. Behind the camera, Valtan
          gestures, go! Dave stumbles into the bedroom, holding the
          huge machine gun like, well, like a corporate lawyer.
          A BLOW-DRIED GOON appears with a gun.BLOW-DRIED GOONNo entry!
          Dave looks around at the bright lights, the camera, the crew
          watching him -- and he freezes up. The goon tries again:BLOWDRIED GOONI said: No entry!42.Then Dave sees a P.A. waving at him, holding up a huge board
          with his lines written on them. Shielding his eyes from the
          lights, Dave reads his lines, monotone:DAVEIf you let me don't in...don't let
          me in...If you don't let me in,

          Taco? Your penmanship is illegible--VALTANFuck it, we fix in post! Just knock
          out guard, wake up girl, and make
          fuck time! Keep rolling!P.A.Still rolling!
          Dave very effeminately "karate chops" the goon in the neck
          once, and the guy dramatically throws himself against the
          wall and drops, unconscious. Then Dave crosses and pretends
          to suddenly see Mona in the bed. His acting is atrocious.DAVEOh my goodness it is Lola my long
          lost lover Lola who...I love. Her.VALTANMore sexy! Too stiff! Annnd Mona
          wake up, surprised!

          Dave, totally grossed out by her, very reluctantly leans in

          girl, NICOLETTE PETERS, knocks her over. Mrs. Kleinman turns
          to see Cara splayed out on the ground, trying not to cry.BALLET TEACHEROh Cara, do try to stay on your

          said I should strive for verbal

          Mitch lights a cigarette with the car lighter.MITCHListen to me, kid: the world is a

          knife, you gotta put their entire
          fucking family in the morgue, okay?
          That's called jailyard justice.

          Okay, but look, it was not my

          me with questions and I had to
          improvise and then everyone got
          very emotional and, well... it looks

I just--TATIANAIs it my new haircut?DAVENo...?TATIANAThe trenchcoat? Too cliche?DAVENo! I love the coat.TATIANAIs it, I don't know, the pregnancy?DAVEWell...now that you mention it?
          Maybe, like, a little?TATIANAWhat the hell?! You picked me up at

          did you expect?!DAVE(HORRIFIED)I did?! That's terrible! Who would
          do something like that?!
          Tatiana angrily crosses the room and -- with considerable
          effort -- bends over and picks up her trenchcoat.55.DAVE (CONT'D)Look, Tatiana, I'm sorry. You're
          incredibly beautiful, it's just--TATIANA(turning, fully naked)
          What?! I'm not sexy?!DAVEOh my god I can see it kicking.
          You can, in fact, see the fetus moving around in her belly.TATIANAYou know what? Fuck you, Mitch.
          Don't ever call me again.
          She yanks on her coat and storms out. Dave stammers.CUT TO:INT. DAVE'S HOUSE -- BATHROOM -- NIGHTIt's bedtime. Wearing pajama pants and no shirt, Mitch
          brushes his teeth and fixes his hair, trying to look sexy. He
          sucks in his dad-gut in the mirror.MITCHJesus, Dave, it's called a sit-up.
          Then he sees Jamie's dress land on the bedroom floor,
          followed by her bra... Mitch exhales:MITCH (CONT'D)Holy shit, I'm finally going to
          fuck Jamie. This is my greatest
          hour! I hope she likes it weird!
          Then, IN SLOW MOTION, Jamie enters the bathroom, nude, her
          hair gently blowing in the wind from an open window. She
          looks insanely hot. Mitch takes her all in, ravenous...MITCH (CONT'D)Oh my God I am going to ruin her--
          And then she sits on the can. And starts taking a dump.
          Mitch's face drops, horrified.JAMIEI have to cool it on the Thai food.
          I've had the shits all day.56.Mitch just stares at her, dumbstruck, as we hear the LOOSE
          CONTENTS OF HER BOWELS empty into the toilet bowl.MITCHOh my GOD.JAMIESeriously -- light a candle.
          She keeps shitting. It sounds like Niagara Falls. Thunderous.
          Foregoing the candle, Mitch covers his nose with his forearm
          and stumbles out of the bathroom, nauseous...INT. BEDROOM -- A FEW MOMENTS LATERMitch lies in bed, staring wide-eyed at the ceiling,
          horrified. Jamie slides in bed with him, touches his arm--MITCH(RECOILING)DON'T FUCKING TOUCH ME!JAMIEWhat is your problem?MITCHLook, I am not attracted to you
          right now, okay?! So just... No

          TIGHT ON Jamie rolling over, confused and genuinely hurt...TIME DISSOLVE TO:PEACEFUL BLACK STILLNESSThen we hear a baby SCREAM BLOODY MURDER. Then a second baby
          joins in, even more shrill than the first. Finally, we hear
          the worst two words a parent can ever hear:JAMIE (O.S.)Your turn.MITCH (O.S.)Mmm?JAMIE (O.S.)It's your turn to feed the twins.MITCH (O.S.)Yeah...I really don't feel like it.
          Jamie turns on the light, pissed.57.JAMIEAre you fucking kidding me?MITCHNo, it's 3 in the morning, you go
           do it. You're the mother.JAMIEGet the fuck out bed right now and

          What?MITCHI always thought your wife was a
          nice lady but she is neither nice
          nor a lady! She talks like a dock-
          worker and she shits like one too!
          Plus I used to think your kids were
          adorable but actually they're just
          really fucking annoying and crazy

          how hard it is to build a reliable
          stable! You don't! It's a full time
          job! Getting girls' phone numbers,
          calling them, emailing them,
          Facebooking them, Twittering them,
          buying them drinks and dinners and
          coffees and listening to endless
          stories about their stupid fucking
          friends and begging them to touch
          your wiener on the second date and
          building an elaborate web of lies
          so they don't all find out about
          each other -- it's exhausting! And
          then poof! In one night, you just
          casually discard my life's work!DAVEJesus, okay, I'm sorry...MITCHSorry doesn't lick my ballbag every
          Tuesday night...DAVELook, is there a reason you're
          calling me at 3 in the morning?
          Mitch glares back to the twins, who are still WAILING.MITCHYeah, your mean wife is making me
          feed the kids. What do I do?DAVEHave you changed their diapers
          already?MITCH(beat, lying)
          Yes. Obviously.60.DAVEOkay, take them to the kitchen.MITCHHold on.
          Mitch puts the phone in his mouth and picks up the SCREAMING
          TWINS. Carrying them like bags of wheat, he jogs downTHE HALLWAYas they scream their heads off. He's totally rattled:MITCHSHUT UP! STOP CRYING! JESUS CHRIST,WE FUCKING HEAR YOU!INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHTMitch jogs into the kitchen and, plop, sets the twins on the
          COUNTER, then speaks into the phone again:MITCHAll right. In the kitchen.DAVEGo to the fridge...
          Mitch turns away from the twins and opens the fridge. He sees
          a bottle of wine and immediately drinks from the bottle.MITCHYeah?DAVEDefrost two bags of breastmilk in
          the microwave for 3 minutes, then
          prepare two separate bottles...
          Mitch grabs a container of cow's milk, sniffs it, turns to
          give it to the babies -- to discover that Sarah is gone, and
          Peter is licking an ELECTRICAL SOCKET!MITCHHoly fuck!
          Mitch yanks Peter away just as SPARKS shoot from the socket!DAVEWhat was that?MITCHNothing! Go on! Two bottles...?61.DAVEFirst: attach the filter to the
          seal to the nipple...
          Mitch hears CLINK CLINK and spins to see that Sarah has
          crawled over to the KNIFE BLOCK and removed a BUTCHER KNIFE
          and a MEAT CLEAVER and is waving them about like rattles!MITCHOh jesus oh jesus...
          Mitch approaches her, wide-eyed, tentative -- when Sarah
          giggles and spastically whips the cleaver at him! He barely
          sidesteps it, and it impacts into a cupboard door -- F-TWANG!MITCH (CONT'D)This is so fucked up!DAVEI know, right? And make sure you
          don't allow any air bubbles in.
          Mitch grabs a pair of tongs and, after a few attempts,
          snatches the butcher knife from Sarah's hands. Then he scoops
          her up and deposits her into the sink with her brother.
          Finally, he slumps over, trying to catch his breath.MITCHDude. Listen to me: you need to go
          downtown first thing tomorrow
          morning and you need to find that
          fucking fountain...
          He starts pouring cow's milk into the babies' mouths. It
          splashes all over them, but they manage to lap up some of it.MITCH (CONT'D)Honestly, I'm really not sure how
          much more of this shit I can take.CUT TO:A DESK PLACARD READING "DISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON"District Manager Carla Nelson sits behind her desk in her

          him with all my heart, you know I
          do, but-you remember Dave's
          family growing up. They were a
          mess. They had nothing. Dave's
          entire childhood was spent looking
          over the fence, wanting a better
          life. So he scrimped and saved and
          worked four jobs at once and put
          himself through school and built a
          better life for himself. I've
          always loved that about him.(MORE)64.JAMIE (CONT'D)No one ever gave him anything. The
          problem is, now that he's got a
          good life, he can't turn it off --
          he's still looking over the fence,
          wanting something even better, a
          second house, more kids, a faster
          car, a bigger promotion, whatever
          it is that he thinks will finally
          make him happy.
          Dave reddens, defensive; this is hitting very close to home.DAVEwell poor Jamie! You have an
          ambitious, hard-working husband who
          provides for you and your family --
          how can you even stand it?JAMIE(TAKEN ABACK)No, I know, I should be grateful...
          and I am...I guess all I'm saying
          is that Dave is so focussed on what
          he doesn't have that he can't see
          what he does. And how long can you
          stay married to someone who is
          incapable of ever being happy...?
          She looks at him, searching. Dave stammers, realizing for the
          first time just how much trouble his marriage is in... Then:MITCHCheck it out: I have freckles on my
          taint! How awesome is that?!
          They turn to see Mitch in the doorway, buck naked and wet,
          holding a hand-mirror under his balls. Then he sees Dave.MITCH (CONT'D)Oh, hey, fag. Why're you here?CUT TO:MITCH (O.S.) (CONT'D)One to three weeks, maybe more?!INT.

          BlackBerry phone, a twin in each arm, a cigarette dangling

          Jamie tenses up. Mitch does too...
          As Cara starts her spin, Nicolette Peters goes to push her
          over -- and Cara calmly grabs her arm, FLIPS her over her
          shoulder, and drops her flat on her back with a loud WHAM!
          As Nicolette starts CRYING, Cara calmly continues dancing
          like nothing happened. The other girls on stage look pleased.
          Mitch CLAPS and WHISTLES:MITCHFUCK YEAH! NICE ONE, CARA!Jamie hits him, SHE, but is clearly proud of her little girl.

          They bump fists. Jamie is stunned.JAMIEWhat?! No, angel, that's exactly
          the wrong lesson. You should never
          use violence, except to defend

          cool...MITCHI know, baby. I know.
          They cruise for a bit longer, then Mitch pulls into a CAR
          WASH. Dave looks confused.83.DAVEWhy are we washing the car? It's
          brand new.MITCHWe're not washing the car, David.

          the ways in which women have
          changed since you last dated...
          Mitch stops at the register to pay. Various CAR WASH
          EMPLOYEES keep saying hi to Dave, weirding him out.CAR WASH EMPLOYEESHola, Mitch! / Como esta, Mitch?!MITCHThe bottom line is: the internet
          has revolutionized everything.DAVEYou mean like J-date?MITCHFuck J-date. No. The internet has
          changed chicks in three major ways:
          first, access and acceptance of
          pornography has commoditized women
          and pressured them into becoming
          sluttier at far younger ages, which
          is awesome.
          Mitch finishes paying and continues through the car wash.MITCH (CONT'D)Second: text messaging has de-
          stigmatized the booty call. Call a
          girl at 3 in the morning for sex
          and it's creepy. Text her "SUCK
          WANG MIDNIGHT??" and it's classy. I
          have no idea why, but again, an
          awesome development.(MORE)84.MITCH (CONT'D)Third: Facebook and other social
          networking sites have falsely
          convinced people -- women included
          -- that they are funny,
          interesting, and unique. Get used
          to listening waaay more than you
          used to. Chicks are the new dudes,
          they talk about themselves all the
          fucking time now. Practice saying
          things like "you are so different"
          and "no, really, what Golden Girl
          would you be?" and "I love Lady
          Gaga too."DAVEWhat's a Lady Gaga?MITCHI don't know, it's either a pop
          singer or an energy drink.
          They arrive at the CAR WASH WAITING AREA. People sit around,
          waiting for their cars, many of them young, female, and cute.MITCH (CONT'D)Okay, let's talk to some honeys,
          get your flow going again.DAVESo wait, why are we at a car wash?MITCHThe girls are alone, bored, and old
          enough to drive -- it's a goldmine.
          I run game here four to seven times
          a week. Now go on, bust a move.DAVECome on, I talk to women all the
          time, I don't need to practice.MITCHReally.DAVEYes. And no offense, as a married
          man, I probably know how to talk to
          women better than you do.MITCHReall v!85.DAVEYes! It's not that hard. They just
          want to be respected and listened
          to like everybody else.MITCHOkay Daddy Day Care show me how
          it's done then! Shit!
          Dave sighs and crosses to a CUTE BLONDE texting nearby. As he
          draws closer, however, he starts to tense up...soon he's
          sweating... it's been a long time ...by the time he finally
          reaches the blonde, his voice is ridiculously shrill:DAVEHello there what's your name?!
          She doesn't even look up from her BlackBerry. Dave's
          confidence instantly crumbles...DAVE (CONT'D)I-I'm sorry, I'm not trying to hit
          on you. I'm just...I mean, I'm
          married, so that's not even a
          thing. W-W-Where are you from--?
          Mitch appears and yanks him away. Dave looks traumatized:DAVE (CONT'D)Was she reaching for her rape
          whistle?MITCHShake it off. Being single is like
          the Tour De France: it's all about
          quick recovery time. Now go on, get
          your groove back, you're meeting
          Sabrina in a half hour.QUICK CUTS:Of Dave trying to chat up various YOUNG WOMEN at the carwash.DAVEYour name is Dora? Like the

          are improving.DAVEI forgot how hard it is to be

          include: your wife, your children,
          your favorite playgrounds, and The

          Dave nods, hating himself. Mitch heads for the Ferrari.MITCH (CONT'D)But this was good. You worked out

          dated this chick named Topaz once
          who may or may not have killed her
           father. Long story short, she
          looked like 50 miles of bad road
          and I wasn't interested, but I used
          our time together to learn about
          incest and the failures of the
          American Appellate Court system. I
          found it hugely informative, and
          Topaz got caught up in my
          enthusiasm and gave me a crying
          blowjob on the car-ride home, so
          everybody won. The point is: find
          the fun for yourself and great
          things will follow.

          Dave, his shirt half-open, moves sensually in sync with
          Sabrina, both of them possessed by the music. They're inches

          Amalgamated execs. No one speaks. It's a corporate staredown.
          Then the mediator, ERIN WALSH, 50's, enters, all business:95.ERIN WALSHThank you all for coming. My name
          is Erin Walsh and I will be

          Amalgamated team sits in their shirtsleeves, waiting in tense

          A large tray of sandwiches sits half-eaten on the sideboard.

          An EXEC gives him a 5 dollar bill. Mitch waves it in the air
          and HUMS the Olympic theme song. Flemming just glares at him
          like, you're so fired. Then the mediator enters.ERIN WALSHKinkabe agrees in principle to the
          terms of the sale, and valuates
          your company at 725 million
          dollars. This is their last and
          final offer. I'll be outside.
          She exits. CEO Ted Norton looks at Flemming, intense.FLEMMING STEEL IIIIt's a fair deal. I don't think
          we'll get much more out of them...

          trying to fuck a Jewish girl and
          she keeps saying "no, no, I don't
          want to, I'm really drunk and
          you're not circumcised" but then
          she keeps making out with you and
          not getting out of your Fiero so
          you know she really does want it,
          she just needs to be nudged a bit
          more so she can rationalize it to
          herself and to her God, know what I
          mean? This is just like that.
          Everyone in the room is speechless. Mitch opens another soda.MITCH (CONT'D)Jesus I do not feel good.FLEMMING STEEL IIIHow is this...at all... like that?MITCHIf this was really their final
          offer, they'd leave. Instead,
          they're sticking around, which
          means they have more money to
          spend.
          Ted looks at his execs. It's not a terrible point...CEO TED NORTONHow much more do you think we can
          get out of them? 10 million? 15?MITCHFuck it, homey, go for 100.CEO TED NORTONWhat?!FLEMMING STEEL IIIDo not listen to him, Ted, he is
          beyond reckless! If we make too
          large a counter-offer, we risk
          driving them away.MITCHEnh, can't hurt to ask. You
          wouldn't believe the nasty shit I
          get girls to do just by asking.
          Honestly, it's revolting.97.Ted looks genuinely torn. He dabs his sweaty brow.MITCH (CONT'D)Seriously, does anyone have a
          Pepto? Because I'm gonna throw.
          Finally, Ted opens the door and says to the mediator:CEO TED NORTONTell Kinkabe we want an extra 100
          million and that is our final
          offer, because we're leaving.

          The mediator heads off as the execs start packing up their
          briefcases, bluffing. Mitch points at Ted.MITCHNice, bro. Way to show some sack.CEO TED NORTONYou had better be right, son, or

          Dave laughs and throws her a towel from the bathroom. She
          starts drying her hair.SABRINA (CONT'D)I need a beer and some dry clothes.

          O-Okay? Well, I guess what's

          Mitch, not earning things never

          maybe I'm growing up.
          We hear the sound of his pants UNZIPPING...MITCH (CONT'D)I mean, sure, I closed the deal
          today, and that felt good, but I
