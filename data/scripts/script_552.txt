               Simon Grim hangs from the back of it. He is a shy, skinny 
               and terrified-looking guy around thirty years old.

               The truck rumbles to a halt and Simon climbs down off it to 
               go punch out at the time clock.EXT. BEHIND THE WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAYMoments later.

               He comes walking up a small alley and sits to drink his beer.

               He begins to relax. This is his quality private time.

               Then he hears something and looks up.

               He peeks up over the edge of some junked kitchen appliances 
               and sees...

               Two teenage kids -- Warren and Amy -- smoking crack and having 
               sex.

               Simon looks on, intrigued, as Warren smokes, then...WARREN(to Amy)
                         You want some?

               Amy takes the pipe and smokes as he feels her up.

               Simon is fascinated. He drinks and looks on as...

               Amy grins up foolishly at Warren and lowers the pipe. The 
               boy undoes his belt and hikes up the girl's skirt.

               Simon can't believe this. He looks around to see if the coast 
               is clear, then returns just in time to see...

               Warren takes Amy by the waist and enter her.

               The pipe falls from the young girl's hand.

               Warren throws his head back and grinds himself into her.

               Simon's mouth falls open in awe.

               But Amy tosses her head back to the side and sees...

               The amazed garbage man; caught.

               Amy starts screaming insanely.

               Simon runs for his life.

               Amy and Warren throw rocks and bottles at him as they chase 
               him away.INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAYMoments later.

               Simon runs up and throws open the screen door. He stands 
               there in the doorway catching his breath.

               His sister, Fay, is at the kitchen table watching a small 
               portable TV while their mother, Mary, sits a few feet away 
               in the living-room watching another TV tuned to a different 
               channel.FAY(to Simon)
                         Where the hell have you been?
                              (to Mary)
                         Mom, come on and eat.MARYI'm not hungry.FAY(pissed)
                         Then why'd I cook!

               Mary is a manic-depressive, still in her bathrobe at six in 
               the evening.MARYI don't know why you cooked! I don't 
                         know why you bother!

               Fay holds her head in her hands and sighs. She glares at her 
               brother.FAYSit down and eat, Simon.

               Simon sits at the table and Fay slams down before him a bowl 
               of some sort of gruel. He hesitates, then lifts his spoon. 
               Supper is horrible and he screws up his face in disgust. Fay 
               gives him a sideways glance and he leans back down over the 
               bowl and eats some more.

               Pushing the bowl away gently, he reaches out for the container 
               of milk on the table and drinks straight from it.

               He suddenly jumps back and spits out sour milk all over the 
               table. The container drops to the floor and thick globs of 
               cheese roll out.

               He stands back against the fridge, holding his stomach 
               while...

               Fay and Mary look on in disgust.EXT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAYMoments later.

               Simon crosses the lawn and sits on the curb outside his house. 
               He stares at the ground before him as he holds his stomach 
               and spits, sickened.

               He looks up, though, and sees...

               A little seven-year-old girl -- Pearl age seven -- standing 
               there in the street watching him.

               Simon tries to smile at her.

               But she throws a rock at him and hits him in the head.

               He falls forward, hurt, as the little girl runs away. Lowering 
               his hand, he sees he's bleeding. Desperate, lonely and ill, 
               he drags his bloodied fingers across the coarse pavement.

               Fay slams out of the side door of the house in a tight-fitting 
               dress and stands on the lawn, applying lipstick.FAYGod, I wanna get fucked.

               Fay snaps shut her compact, straightens her skirt and sighs.FAYYou OK?

               Simon loses track of what he is hearing and relaxes. He looks 
               back at his sister.

               Fay fluffs out her hair and walks off.FAYSee ya later.

               Simon watches her go, but is still drawn to something he 
               seems to hear up the street in the other direction. He cocks 
               his head, sits perfectly still and listens.

               He hears it now. We do, too. Footsteps. Big ones. Like a 
               giant somewhere in the distance. The neighborhood trembles.

               Titles begin.

               Simon tries to figure out where it's coming from; the sky, 
               the house, the highway at the end of his block... Finally, 
               he focuses on...

               The blacktop right before him, smeared with his own blood.

               Music starts.

               He kneels out slowly into the street and stares at the 
               pavement. He stretches out his hand and places it flat on 
               the road. The pounding is louder now, becoming the beat of 
               the music over the scene.

               Simon lowers his face to the pavement, closes his eyes and...

               Puts his ear right down against the road. He hears...

               The steady tread of somebody very much larger than life.

               Kneeling forward, with his ear to the ground, Simon opens 
               his eyes and sees...

               A man approaching. The music swells up full.

               Simon lifts his head slowly from the road, looking off in 
               wonder at...

               This stranger coming towards him; an oddly handsome freak 
               striding over the crest of the distant intersection with a 
               windswept mane, two over-stuffed suitcases and a crumpled 
               tie fluttering back over his broad but crooked shoulders.

               Simon rises till he's kneeling up straight in the road.

               Henry Fool finally reaches him and stops.

               Titles finish.

               Simon says nothing and watches as Henry looks off at the 
               house.

               Satisfied, but wary, Henry Fool looks around the neighborhood 
               and then down at Simon.HENRYGet up off your knees.

               He tosses the suitcases down in front of Simon and walks off 
               towards his new home.EXT. BACK OF THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAYHenry comes around behind the house and finds the door to 
               his basement apartment. He approaches. Simon follows, carrying 
               the suitcases.INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAYMoments later.

               The door is wrenched open and Henry is hit square in the jaw 
               by a decade of dank airless gloom. He coughs.

               Entering, he finds a few old wooden chairs littering the 
               main room. He inspects the old wood stove, then takes a chair 
               and smashes it. He tosses the wood in the stove.

               Simon looks on, amazed. Henry lights a fire with unusually 
               quick results, then stands back and looks at Simon.HENRYWhere you gotta go to get a six-pack 
                         of beer around here?INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAYThis is a convenience store with a number of tables at which 
               to eat donuts.

               Warren is shoplifting while Amy terrorizes Gnoc Deng, the 
               Vietnamese cashier, who stares out at them from behind the 
               safety of the counter.AMYSay something.WARREN(calling)
                         She's mute.AMYWhat?WARRENShe don't -- you know -- talk.

               Amy looks back at Gnoc, snarls, then follows the cashier's 
               gaze to the door.

               Simon enters. Clutching Henry's cash, he stops dead in his 
               tracks when he sees...

               Warren and Amy.

               He steps forward and approaches the beer cooler.

               Warren and Amy hover around, just out of reach, like a couple 
               of vampires.

               Dragging a six-pack out of the cooler, Simon crosses to the 
               counter. Warren and Amy hang back, silent and threatening.

               Gnoc rings up the purchase and glances over at...

               Amy, staring a hole into the side of Simon's skull.

               Gnoc hands Simon back his change and he makes for the door, 
               but...

               Warren shoves himself between it and Simon.

               Simon freezes. Warren is expressionless. Simon looks back at 
               Amy. She turns away, reaches up under her skirt, jerks down 
               her panties, then leans forward on to the counter. Leering 
               back over her shoulder, she hisses...AMYKiss my ass.

               Simon is nonplussed.

               Gnoc presses a button on the wall that sets...

               A red light flashing above the stockroom door.

               Warren grabs Simon by the neck and drags him over to Amy's 
               bare behind. Amy laughs as Simon is forced to his knees and 
               has his face shoved up right into the crack of her ass.

               But then... Simon throws up all over her.

               Warren falls back in disgust.

               Gnoc covers her face with her hands.

               Amy looks around at herself, realizes, and starts screaming 
               bloody murder.

               Simon falls back on to the floor, clutching his stomach, as 
               Amy staggers around with her vomit-strewn underwear down 
               around her ankles.

               Then Gnoc's father, Mr Deng, appears at the stockroom door 
               holding a shovel and ready to fight.WARREN(scared)
                         Oh, shit!

               Mr Deng comes running at them and Warren drags Amy from the 
               store. Simon crawls out of the way as the old man throws 
               open the door to the parking lot and screams at the retreating 
               delinquents...MR DENG(in Vietnamese)
                         Stay the hell out of my store, you 
                         good-for-nothing punks!

               Having scared them off, he comes back in and starts screaming 
               at Simon.MR DENGLook at this! What's going on here? 
                         Simon, get up off the floor! Is this 
                         beer paid for?INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- NIGHTLater.

               Simon splashes water over his face at the kitchen sink, then 
               watches as Henry unpacks one of his suitcases. It is filled 
               with dozens of old, worn notebooks. Henry stacks them on the 
               mantelpiece over the fireplace; the fire is now crackling 
               and bright.

               Simon steps over and looks at...

               The name tag on the other suitcase: 'Henry Fool'.HENRY(off-screen)
                         Centuries ago it had an 'e' at the 
                         end.

               Simon looks over and sees...

               Henry's silhouette against the fire. He steps forward into 
               the light and grabs a beer from the six-pack on the floor. 
               He hands one to Simon.

               Simon takes it and stares at it a moment before raising his 
               eyes to Henry.SIMONWhere do you come from?HENRYNowhere in particular.

               He winks at Simon, then struts around the room, hugely 
               impressed with himself.HENRYI go where I will and I do what I 
                         must.
                              (stops, drinks)
                         That's why I'm in trouble. I'm sort've 
                         what you might call... 'in exile'.SIMONWhy are you in trouble?HENRY(stopping)
                         An honest man is always in trouble, 
                         Simon. Remember that.

               Simon comes away from the fire, watching him carefully. Henry 
               stands in a dim corner across the room.SIMONHow do you know my name?

               Henry pauses, looks aside, drinks, then grins demoniacally. 
               He steps forward and comes face to face with Simon. He lifts 
               his finger and points to...

               Simon's name stitched upon the breast of his work shirt.

               Realizing this, Simon moves off and thinks.

               Henry throws more wood on the fire, glancing back over his 
               shoulder, laughing mischievously.SIMON(stopping him)
                         I am not retarded.HENRY(pauses)
                         Well... I'll take your word for that.SIMON(explaining)
                         People. I mean. They think. You know. 
                         Because.

               He tries to articulate what he thinks he feels but winds up 
               gesticulating curiously with his hands. This finally dissolves 
               into a dumb stare into empty space.HENRYI see.

               Simon looks at him. Henry stands and grabs a notebook from 
               off the mantelpiece. He tears out a few pages and shoves 
               them in his pocket. He hands the now fresh writing tablet to 
               Simon.HENRYHere. Take this. And...

               He searches his pockets and finds a pencil.HENRY...this. Keep them with you at all 
                         times. You ever feel like you got 
                         something to say and you can't get 
                         it out, stop and write it down. OK?

               Simon hesitates, then accepts the gifts. Henry goes for 
               another beer while his new friend studies the dozens of 
               notebooks on the mantelpiece.SIMONWhat are these?HENRY(proudly, returning)

               He smokes. Simon is impressed. They hear a bottle smash 
               outside in the street and Henry goes to the window. They're 
               throwing bottles at the house.HENRY(throwing down his

               Henry sees this and settles down. He considers his new friend 
               with genuine care as he gets himself a new cigarette. He 
               lights up, thinks, then grabs another chair and sits close

               Simon sits with his evening beer and his new collection of 
               soiled classics. He cracks open a volume of Shakespeare and 
               tries to read. It's an obvious struggle. He puts it aside 
               and lifts up Wordsworth, studying its cover and the texture 
               of the pages. A page flutters away and he climbs down to the 
               edge of a greasy puddle to retrieve it. It's now wet and 
               torn, so he flattens it out on the concrete and tries to fit 
               it back into the book.

               He reads a little, furrowing his brow, then drinks. He bites 
               his lip and tries again.

               Simon crawls away and grabs hold of an old section of fence, 
               while Warren zips up and grabs the fire from Amy.

               Simon pulls himself to his knees, rests his face against the

               Warren watches him blankly, then is burned by the torch which 
               is too hot to handle. He drops it.

               Pearl stares at the floor. She glances over at him, then 
               back down at the bottle gripped in her hands. She nods.

               Henry pauses, then comes across the room, lowering himself

               into viciousness.

               He grabs Henry and throws him violently down the hall, where 
               he hits the wall and collapses.

               As Henry gets to his knees, Warren kicks him in the ribs. 
               Henry curls up and rolls out on to the kitchen floor. Warren 
               kicks him in the side of the head.

               Father Hawkes and Mr Deng helping Henry outside. Coming out 
               into the daylight, he straightens up and manages to walk on 
               his own. He motions Ned over and leans down to the kid with 
               difficulty.HENRYGotta light?

               Ned does. He has his own Zippo lighter and he proudly lights 
               his dad's cigarette.

               Henry smokes, hugs Ned, then leans back and pauses. Finally...HENRYTake care of your mom and don't start 
                         trouble you can't finish.

               Ned nods and Henry pats him on the shoulder. Then he stands 
               before Fay and looks at his feet. With her arms folded across 
               her chest and her hip cocked, she taps her foot impatiently 
               and waits for his last line of crap.HENRYI love you, Fay.FAY(rolls her eyes)
                         Yeah, well, tough.

               But then she looks at him and softens. He leans in and kisses 
               her passionately on the mouth.

               Moments later, they all help Henry into Bu�uel's car and 
               Simon gets in behind the wheel. The doors slam shut and Simon 
               steers the car slowly up the alley. Henry gazes out at Fay 
               running along beside the car with the rest of the 
               neighborhood, some of them laughing, some of them crying...EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL -- DAYSimon pulls up at the curb and jumps out. He helps Henry

               As they are ushered up towards the gate, Henry stops and 
               looks off at the security guards and ground crew waiting for 
               him, certain they can spot him as a wanted criminal.SIMON(shoves him)

               Henry is ushered through security. They take his ticket and 
               check his passport again. They take his suitcase and place 
               it on the conveyor belt. He passes through the metal detector.
