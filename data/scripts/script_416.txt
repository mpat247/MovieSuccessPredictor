Fast Times at Ridgemont HighFADE IN:EXT. RIDGEMONT CENTER MALL - NIGHTFrom the outside parking lot it looks like an
enormous beached whale. It is the prime hangout for
all the teenagers in the area. Kids mill around the
parking lot or stand by the mall entrance.INT. RIDGEMONT CENTER MALLThere are three levels of stores underneath a
massive fluorescent roof. Different music comes
from each store. It looks seventies-modern, but
already used and run-down. Groups of kids cruise
the mall, eyeing each other and acting cool.INT. SWENSON'S ICE-CREAM PARLOR - NIGHTThe teenage waitresses in their peppermint pattie
uniforms are rushing around, trying to keep up with
their orders.

A good-looking man in his mid-twenties enters and
sits. He wears a plastic name tag that says:
"Pacific Stereo Audio Consultant, RON JOHNSON."

Two Swenson's Waitresses pass by with supreme
indifference, and take their orders into the back
kitchen.INT. SWENSON'S BACK KITCHENWAITRESS #1I think he looks like Richard Gere.

The two Waitresses discuss the issue at hand. One
of them, Linda Barrett, is the seventeen year old,
retired sex queen of Ridgemont High.WAITRESS #1 (CONT'D)I think he looks like... Richard
	Gere. (Bruce Springsteen)LINDADid you see his cute little butt?

A third waitress enters.WAITRESS #2Let's talk about C-19.WAITRESS #1 AND LINDAWe were!WAITRESS #2I think I'll drop over and change
	the shakers.LINDANo, be cool, that's Stacy's
	section.

Through the entrance, we see Stacy Hamilton. She is
the fifteen-year-old trainee, sweet-looking with
just the last traces of baby fat. She puts down a
glass of water for Ron, spills some and mops it up.WAITRESS #1He's too old for Stacy, she hasn't
	even started high school yet.

A flustered Stacy enters the back kitchen.LINDAHow's it going.STACYDo you think that guy's cute?WAITRESS #1In a blow-dryed kind of way.STACYDoes anyone else want to take his
	table?LINDADon't you like him?STACYYeah, but I fucked up. You can take
	it. Really.LINDACome on, Stacy, it's your section
	and your man.STACYWhat should I do?LINDAJust take his order, look him in
	the eye and if he says anything
	remotely funny, laugh a lot.

She fluffs up Stacy's hair and gently shoves her
towards the door. Stacy reluctantly exits.INT. SWENSON'S DINING ROOMStacy goes to Ron's table.RONSo you working hard or hardly
	working?

Stacy thinks it over, decides it's a joke and
laughs (a little too late). Ron looks at her
soulfully.RON (CONT'D)You look like you could still be in
	high school.STACYI know, everyone says that.

He stares at her and she stares back uncomfortably.STACY (CONT'D)What can I get for you tonight.RONHow about your phone number?

Stacy smiles nervously.INT. RIDGEMONT MALL - OUTSIDE SWENSON'S - NIGHTA teenage boy stands in front of an in-mall theatre
across from Swenson's. He wears a stiff over-sized
tuxedo suit. He is Mark "The Rat" Ratner, a ticket
taker on the job.

Mike Damone, a transplanted Easterner, bops over
from the record store, eyeing every girl he passes.
He stops at the movie theatre.THE RATDo you ever look at those girls who
	work at Swenson's? They're
	beautiful. And I have to stand out
	here and watch them six nights a
	week.DAMONEYou should work for yourself.

Two Junior High Kids spot Damone, walk up to him.DAMONE (CONT'D)What can I do for you, gentlemen?JUNIOR HIGH KID #1You the guy with the Van Halen
	tickets?DAMONEI could be.JUNIOR HIGH KID #2What do you want for something in
	the first ten rows?DAMONETwenty bucks apiece.JUNIOR HIGH KID #1Those tickets were only twelve
	fifty!DAMONESo don't buy 'em.JUNIOR HIGH KID #2(to friend)
	All the other scalpers are sold
	out, Arnold.

Damone reacts indignantly.DAMONEScalper? You call me a scalper? I
	perform a service, my friends. The
	service costs money. Now do you
	want the tickets or not?

The Kids look at each other.JUNIOR HIGH KID #1Are you sure you can't go any
	lower.DAMONEThese are my special back-to-school
	prices.JUNIOR HIGH KID #2We'll take 'em.

Damone reaches inside his pants pocket for a wad of
tickets.EXT. CARL'S JR. - NIGHTAt the other end of the mall is a neon-lit Carl's
Jr. Hamburger Restaurant. If Swenson's was the warm
up, this is the main attraction of the Ridgemont
Mall.INT. CARL'S JR.Back-to-school banners hang from the walls. Many
kids are lined up at the counters. In the middle of
the kitchen, directing all the orders, is a
seventeen year old named Brad. He moves
confidently, observing the fryer, checking cup
supply, and giving an affectionate squeeze to a
pretty cashier named Lisa. She lets him kiss her,
but only once.

A teenage Customer shouts to Brad from the front
counter.CUSTOMERHey Brad! I waited till you came
	on! I wanted your fries.

Brad smiles, walks over to the fryer and discards
the fries left from the previous shift. He shouts
to the other employees as he puts in a new batch,
"his" batch.BRADWe need fifteen Superstars, David!FELLOW EMPLOYEE #1Okay, Brad!BRADI'll take care of the fry orders!
	Just get me the Superstars!FELLOW EMPLOYEE #2Fish sandwiches!

Brad spots three surfers sitting in the dining
area. None of them are wearing shirts.BRADHey you guys! You had shirts on
	when you came in here.ANGLE ON THE MAIN SURFERa bleary kid sitting at the head of the table. He
runs a hand through his long, stringy blond hair.
After a time, he speaks.SPICOLISomething happened to them, mon.BRADCome on, Spicoli. Why don't you
	just put your shirts back on? See
	the sign?ANGLE ON HANDWRITTEN SIGN IN WINDOWthat reads: "No Shirts, No Shoes, No Dice"INT. CARL'S JR.A store manager, Dennis Taylor, bustles up to Brad.DENNISAny problems?BRADNo, just a couple of surfers with
	no shirts on. I took care of it,
	Dennis.ANGLE ON SURFERSgrumbling, putting shirts back on. It pains them.

Dennis heads back to his office when he sees
something in the trash bin.DENNISDid you throw away those fries,
	Hamilton?BRADThey were left over from the last
	shift.DENNISThose were perfectly good fries,
	Hamilton. 
		(glares at Brad)
	Perfectly good.BRADBut they weren't mine.

Brad laughs, goes back to work.INT. MALL - LATE NIGHTIt is closed and only a few janitors remain. Stacy
and Linda walk through the large empty mall.STACYHe gave me his card. 
		(lovingly)
	'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'LINDA(amused)
	Should we buy a frame for that?STACYCome on, Linda, I haven't had a
	boyfriend all summer. You promised
	when I started working at the mall
	that my life would change... Do you
	think he'll call this week?LINDAListen, Stace, you want to know
	about guys? I'll tell you. They're
	mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I
	chased after every guy I thought
	was cute. I thought if I gave out a
	vibe they'd get the message and
	call me up. Well, guess what? They
	don't call.STACYSo what did you do?LINDAI called them. If I was sitting
	next to a guy and I wanted to sit
	closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted
	to kiss him, I'd just do it. You
	want Ron Johnson? Grab him.STACYI can't do that.

They pass a janitor cleaning graffiti that says:
LINCOLN SURF NAZIS and MAGGOT LUST FOR THE DUST.LINDAFace it. With some guys you have to
	make the first move. A lot of guys
	are just... wussies.STACYReally?LINDAStacy, what are you waiting for?
	You're fifteen. I did it when I was
	thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's
	just sex. If you don't, one of the
	other girls will.STACY(cute)
	He was hot, wasn't he?LINDAIf I didn't have a fiance in
	Chicago, I'd go for it.

A young Girl runs and catches up with Linda and
Stacy.GIRL(breathless)
	Are you Linda Barrett?LINDAYes.GIRLI'm Carrie Frazier from Toys 'R Us.
	Judy Hinton from May Company told
	me I could ask you something.

Linda nods.GIRL (CONT'D)I have this situation with my
	boyfriend, and I wanted to... 
		(looks at Stacy, then
		whispers in Linda's ear)

Linda listens thoughtfully, then clicks into her
"sex expert" mode.LINDAOkay, are you over sixteen?

The Girl nods.LINDA (CONT'D)All right, what you want to do is
	go to the Free Clinic and tell the
	doctor that you have sex regularly 
	- several times a week -- and that
	you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.GIRLAnd they don't call my parents?LINDANot if you're over sixteen.GIRLOkay. Thanks a lot, Linda.LINDAAnd don't let them talk you into a
	diaphragm either.

The Girl thanks Linda again. Linda and Stacy get to
the back exit of the mall and Linda uses a key to
open the door.STACYI can't believe I start high school
	tomorrow.LINDABelieve it.

They exit the mall, into the night.EXT. RIDGEMONT SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAYWe see all the elements of the first day of school.
The students carry new books, explore new lockers,
begin to stake out their ground.

Someone has taken the steel letters from the green
vanguard out front. It reads: "IDG MON SENOR HIHO."The rest of Ridgemont High is covered with toilet
paper. And a black spray paint message along the
side of the front office building reads, "LINCOLNSURF NAZIS."EXT. RIDGEMONT PARKING LOT - DAYBrad pulls into the Ridgemont High parking lot. He
drives a beat-up, four-door model LTD sedan. Three
friends wait for him near his parking space.
They are dressed in the same golf caps with brand
logos on the front like CAT, NATIONAL and CHAINSAW.BUDDY #1Hamilton!BUDDY #2The cruising vessel! Hey -- Yooooo!

Brad climbs out of his car and pats it admiringly.BRADSix more payments, gentlemen.

Brad joins his friends, and they walk towards the
gymnasium.EXT. RIDGEMONT PARKING LOTWe see a shiny, new, blue Mustang whip into the
parking lot. Students scatter from the parking
space. Behind the wheel is football star Charles
Jefferson. A huge, black kid. The halls at
Ridgemont part for Charles Jefferson.

Rat and Damone are in the parking lot. Damone
surrounded by underclassmen (customers) selling
tickets.DAMONESee that Mustang? U.C.L.A. gave
	Charles Jefferson that car when he
	was a sophomore.

The underclassmen are impressed. They watch as
Jefferson opens his car door and stands to his full
height, over six-foot tall. He opens his trunk and
pulls out no books, just a football duffel bag. He
slowly walks by Damone, Rat and the underclassmen.DAMONE (CONT'D)How ya doing! That car looks great,
	Charles!

Jefferson gives Damone a death glare.JEFFERSONDon't... fuck... with... it.

He moves on. Damone resumes selling tickets.DAMONEShit, that's my man.EXT. RIDGEMONT PARKING LOTWe see a clutching, smooching couple walk by.
Cheerleader Cindy Carr and her boyfriend, Gregg
Adams.EXT. RIDGEMONT PARKING LOT - DAYThe Four Stoners (from Carl's Jr.) tumble out of a
van in the parking lot. They head towards the
gymnasium.INT. RIDGEMONT GYMNASIUM - DAYStanding by the A-B-C-D-E registration counter in
the gymnasium, Brad waits to pick up his red ad
card. He stands surrounded by his buddies. They nod
vigorously at everything Brad says. As he talks,
fellow students all say hello or pat him as they
pass.

One troubled-looking boy, Arnold, walks up to Brad.ARNOLDBrad, can I talk to you a minute?BRADArnold. What's happening?

Arnold speaks confidentially to Brad.ARNOLDBrad, I really fuckin' hate
	McDonald's, man. Ever since they
	started in with the chicken,
	everything went downhill.BRADYou want to work at Carl's?ARNOLDOh, man, if you could swing
	something there, I'd do anything
	for you. I want to work with you
	guys.BRADI can probably get you in there.
	Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.ARNOLDAll right!!

Brad notices Stacy and nods with complete inner
cool.STACYHi, Brad.BRADSis.BRAD'S BUDDIESHey, Stacy.STACYHi... Where's Lisa?BRADEveryone wants to know where Lisa
	is. How should I know where Lisa
	is?

	What am I gonna do? Now my little
	sister goes to the same high
	school. The party's over.
		(to Stacy)
	So who do you have first period?STACYU.S. History. Mr. Hand.BRADHey-yo.DAVIDHey-yoooooooooo.STACY(concerned)
	What's wrong with Mr. Hand?BRADNothing... if you like 'Hawaii Five
	O.' You better get in class, Stacy.
	That's not the one to be late to.

Stacy hurries off.RICH(as soon as she is gone)
	Your sister is really turning into
	a fox.BRADYou should see her in the morning.BRAD'S BUDDIESHey-yooooooooooo.INT. U.S. HISTORY CLASS - DAYStacy barely slips in the door before the final
attendance bell sounds. She finds a seat just as
the teacher's cubicle door opens at the back of the
classroom. A tall figure comes barreling down the
aisle. He is Mr. Hand. The man makes a double-speed
step to the door at the front of the class, kicks
the door shut and locks it. The windows rattle in
their frames. Stacy watches, wide-eyed, at her
first high school class.MR. HANDAloha. My name is Mr. Hand.

Mr. Hand writes his name on the green chalkboard
before his class. Every letter is a small explosion
of chalk.MR. HAND (CONT'D)(almost sweetly)
	I have but one question for you on
	our first morning 'together.' 
		(pause)
	Can you attend my class? Pakalo?...
	Understand?... History has proven
	us one basic fact. Man does not do
	anything that is not for his own
	good. It is for your own good that
	you attend my class. And if you
	can't make it... I can make you.

An impatient knock begins at the front door of the
classroom.MR. HAND (CONT'D)We have a twenty-question quiz
	every Friday. It will cover all the
	material we've dealt with during
	the week. There will be no make-up
	exams. It's important that you all
	have your Land of Truth and Liberty
	textbooks by Wednesday. At the
	latest.

The knock continues.MR. HAND (CONT'D)Your grade is the average of all
	your quizzes, plus the midterm and
	final, which counts for one-third.
	Got it?

The mystery knocker tries a lazy calypso beat on
the front door. No one in Mr. Hand's U.S. History
class dares mention it, much less answer it.

Stacy grips her desk with the tension of her first
day.MR. HAND (CONT'D)Also. There will be no eating in
	this class. You get used to doing
	your own business on your own time.
	That's one demand I make. I don't
	like staying after class with you
	on detention. That's my time. I
	don't like wasting it. Just like
	you wouldn't want me to come to
	your house some evening and discuss
	U.S. History on your time. Pakalo?

Hand finally turns, as if he has just noticed the
sound at the door and opens the door an inch.
Jeffrey Spicoli stands in the doorway, red eyes
glistening. His long, blond hair is still wet and
streaming down the back of his white peasant shirt.
He grins, oblivious to such trivial matters as
attendance bells. A Student sitting near Stacy
turns to his friends.STUDENTThat guy has been stoned since the
	third grade.MR. HANDYes?SPICOLIYeah. I'm registered for this
	class.MR. HANDWhat class?SPICOLIThis is U.S. History, right? I saw
	the globe in the window.MR. HAND(appears enthralled)
	Really?

Spicoli holds his red ad card up to the crack in
the door.SPICOLICan I come in?MR. HAND(swinging door open)
	Oh, please. I get so lonely when
	that third attendance bell rings
	and I don't see all my kids here.

Spicoli laughs. He is the only one.SPICOLISorry I'm late. This new schedule
	is totally confusing.

Mr. Hand takes the red ad card and reads from it
with utter fascination.MR. HANDMr. Spicoli?SPICOLIThat's the name they gave me.

Mr. Hand slowly tears the card into little pieces
and sprinkles the pieces over his wastebasket.
Spicoli watches in disbelief. His hands are frozen
in the process of removing his backpack.SPICOLI (CONT'D)You just ripped my card in two!MR. HANDYes.SPICOLIHey, bud. What's your problem?

Mr. Hand moves to within inches of Spicoli's face.MR. HANDNo problem at all. I think you know
	where the front office is.

It takes a moment for the words to work their way
out of Jeff Spicoli's mouth.SPICOLIYou... dick.

In the tense moment that follows, no one in the
class is sure what might happen.

Mr. Hand simply turns away from Jeff Spicoli as if
he ceased to exist and coolly continues his
lecture.MR. HANDI've taken the time to print up a
	complete schedule of class quizzes,
	and the chapters they cover. Please
	pass them back to the desks behind
	you...

Hand begins passing out stacks of purple
mimeographed sheets.ANGLE ON STUDENTSall smelling the purple mimeographed sheets.

Still standing in the doorway, hyperventilating
with fifteen-year-old adrenalin, is Jeff Spicoli.
After a time, he fishes a few bits of his ad card
out of the wastebasket and huffs out of the room.EXT. RIDGEMONT LUNCH COURT - AFTERNOONIt's packed. The school's outdoor dining area is
actually just a small courtyard lined with fast
food machines and dominated by a large oak tree in
the center. Standing at the center of lunch court,
under the large oak tree, is Brad Hamilton and his
golf-cap Buddies.BRADYou hear about the surfer in Mr.
	Hand's class?

His Buddies shake their heads.BRAD (CONT'D)Told Hand to fuck off.BRAD'S BUDDIESWhoa!_

Brad sees another friend pass through lunch court.BRADThompson!

Brad waits for him to pass.BRAD (CONT'D)I hear Thompson got canned at Bob's
	this summer.BUDDY #1Yeah. They hacked his hours, so he
	quit.BRADWhere is he now?BUDDY #1Making two eighty at Seven-Eleven.BRADMan.

	They make you wear a fuckin' candy
	stripe suit over there.BUDDY #2Poor guy.BRADPoor guy.EXT. LUNCH COURT - ANGLE ON THE 200 BUILDINGBATHROOMnear the outer rim of lunch court. Jeff Spicoli
comes stumbling out into the daylight, surrounded
by a small group of Ridgemont Stoners. Marijuana
smoke billows out behind them.STONER BUDDY #1It was so bitchin', mon. Everybody
	is talking about it.STONER BUDDY #2Totally.SPICOLIThe motherfucker pissed me off.STONER BUDDY #2Totally. You don't have to take
	that shit.SPICOLII didn't take that shit.

They all laugh, flip hair out of their eyes.STONER BUDDY #1Tell us again. What happened after
	he ripped up your ad card?SPICOLII called him a dick. And then I
	reached for his class notes, and I
	ripped 'em up. I said, 'Hey bud.
	Two can play this game.'

The Stoners go wild.SPICOLI (CONT'D)I'll tell you this. If he hassles
	me again, I can't be responsible
	for what happens... you know why?STONER BUDDY #1Because he's a fuckin' dick!SPICOLIYou got it.
		(pause)
	Gimme a dollar.

One surfer digs out a dollar for Spicoli. They look
out at lunch court, see it teeming with straight
kids. They turn and walk towards the parking lot.EXT. LUNCH COURT - ANGLE ON STACY AND LINDAas they walk onto lunch court. They take a seat on
the outskirts of the area and watch all the
students crowding onto the eating area.LINDAI hear some surfer pulled a knife
	on Mr. Hand this morning.STACYNo way! He just called him a dick.LINDAGod. People exaggerate so much at
	this school.

The school couple, Cindy and Gregg walk by.CINDYHi, Linda. God, you look so great.LINDAHi, you guys. This is Stacy. Stacy,
	this is Gregg Adams and Cindy Carr.GREGG AND CINDYHi, Stacy.

Stacy smiles. Gregg and Cindy move on, repeating
the same scene a few feet away.LINDAIf there's one thing that never
	changes... it's a cheerleader.

Stacy turns to see a girl with short, black hair
passing by, wearing tight black spandex pants, and
dark lipstick.STACYLinda. That girl looks just like
	Pat Benatar.LINDAI know.

They watch her pass.LINDA (CONT'D)Actually, there are three girls at
	Ridgemont who have cultivated the
	Pat Benatar look.

Linda gestures out on lunch court.ANGLE ON ANOTHER PAT BENATAR LOOK-ALIKEwearing pink spandex pants and short-cropped black
hair with dark lipstick.ANGLE ON STILL ANOTHER PAT BENATAR LOOK-ALIKEwearing blue spandex pants and short black hair.
She stands a good distance away from the other two.LINDA (CONT'D)None of them talk to each other.

Linda looks at them with bemusement but Stacy is
wondering.STACYDo you think guys find that
	attractive?LINDAOh, give me a break, Stacy. You're
	much prettier than them.

They sit and eat their lunches. Linda has her
perennial diet lunch of yogurt and raw vegetables.STACYYeah but they look more
	sophisticated. You'd probably think
	they'd be better in bed.LINDAWhat do you mean 'better in bed.'
	You either do it or you don't.STACYNo there are variables that, like,
	I might not be good at.LINDAWhat variables?STACY(shyly)
	Like, you know, giving blow jobs.LINDAWhat's the big deal?STACYWell I never did it.LINDAThere's nothing to it.

She takes out a carrot stick and eases it down her
throat. Stacv tries one but chokes.LINDA (CONT'D)You just have to practice a little
	first. 
		(feels her throat)
	Relax these muscles. Think of your
	throat as an open tunnel.

The girls try sliding the carrot sticks down their
throats without gagging.ANGLE ON A BOYat the next table; sees them and points them out to
his companions.STACYWhat happens... don't laugh at me,
	but when a guy has an orgasm... you

Stacy stops practicing and looks horrified. Linda
laughs.LINDAJust kidding. About 10cc.STACY(enlightened)
	Oh! That's where that group got its
	name from.

They continue practicing as the boys look on. Stacy
manages to get almost a whole carrot down her
throat to Linda's amazement.

The group of boys break out in applause.

Stacy looks very embarrassed.INT. BIOLOGY LAB - DAYThe class is situated so that all students sit at
Bunson burner tables lining the room.

Pat is seated at one of the tables and Stacy takes
a seat nearby; she looks at the ledge in front of
her. It contains a pig embryo. She listens to the
conversation next to her.GIRL STUDENTI'll tell you right now. I'm not
	going. I'll get sick or something.
	I'm not going into a room with a
	bunch of dead guys.ARNOLDYou'll go. It's part of the final.GIRL STUDENT(a Pat Benatar)

	this stuff out?GIRL STUDENTYes.BOY STUDENTLike a heart?GIRL STUDENTHearts, lungs, guts...

Stacy strains to hear more, just as Mr. Vargas -- a
diminutive man holding a coffee mug -- enters the
class.MR. VARGASGood day, everyone! I just switched
	to Sanka. I'm running a little slow
	today, so have a heart.ANGLE ON THE RATHe is riveted on Stacy Hamilton, swooning.DISSOLVETO:INT. STACY'S ROOM - NIGHTWe see Stacy's room, a young girl's room with
posters and frilly pillows. Stacy is in bed, and
her Mother is just leaving the room.MOTHERSleep tight, Stacy.STACYGood night, Mom.

Her Mother shuts off the light, exits. Stacy pulls
back the covers. She is fully dressed.EXT. STACY'S WINDOW - NIGHTWe see the window to Stacy's room slide slowly
open, and watch her slip outside. She hikes down a
drainage pipe to the street.EXT. STREET CORNER - NIGHTA brown MG pulls up. Stacy jumps from the shadows
and hops in. The car drives away.INT. RON'S CAR - NIGHTRon sits behind the wheel, humming casually along
to the music on his car stereo.

Ron has on a light-brown leather jacket. He looks
like a contestant for "The Dating Game."STACY(a little nervous)
	Thanks for picking me up.RONNo problem.

He speeds off, turning up the radio to sing along.RON (CONT'D)'The Cuer-vo Gold, the fi-ine
	Columbian.'

	The point sounds fine.RON(looks at her knowingly)
	All right, the point it is.

We see Stacy's anxious face, as the car speeds up
Ridgemont Drive, with music.EXT. THE POINT - NIGHTStacy and Ron sit in the car, listening to music.
The "point" is a natural lookout spot that lovers
can "discover." It is behind the baseball field and
dugout of Ridgemont High School.

Stacy and Ron get out of the car and walk to the
baseball dugout.INT. DUGOUT - NIGHTThey sit side-by-side. Above them, a single light
bulb shines a very private fifty watts on things.STACYThat's a nice shirt.RONThanks. Thanks a lot.

Silence. They look at each other, look away.RON (CONT'D)It's very warm out tonight.STACYIt is. It's very warm. I wonder how
	long it will last?

Ron leans over and kisses Stacy lightly on the
cheek. Stacy sits quietly for a moment, thinking,
was that the first move? Then she lunges at Ron and
kisses him square on the mouth. At first surprised,
Ron then holds her there and kisses her in return.
After a time, he breaks away.RONAre you really nineteen?STACYYes... I am really nineteen.

They continue making out.RONI think I better take you home.STACYWhat about those other guys you
	live with?RONNo. I mean back to your home.

But they make no moves in any direction. They
continue making out. Ron begins unbuttoning her
blouse and massaging Stacy's breasts. A moment
later, he tugs at her pants. Awkwardly, she starts
to help him. He tilts her backward onto the
concrete dugout bench. They kiss feverishly, her

goes to work.RON (CONT'D)(whispers)

	serious?STACYCome on, Linda. It's just sex.LINDAHey! That's my line!

They both laugh and walk down the hall.EXT. HAMILTON HOME - LATE AFTERNOONStacy arrives home. The Hamilton home has that
anonymous prepackaged tract look, like many others
in this lower-middle class neighborhood.

Brad washes his car in the driveway and listens to
the car radio.BRADMom says to clean up the pool.STACYWhy can't you do it?BRADYour friends use the pool. Your
	friends messed it up.STACYYour friends use the pool too.BRADI take out the garbage.STACYDon't strain yourself.

Stacy bristles, and heads inside the front door.INT. HAMILTON LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOONThe furniture in the Hamilton living room looks
like it was gleaned for a sale at Pic 'N Save.
Through the living room, one can see a very small,
kidney-shaped pool.

Stacy checks an erasable telephone message sheet
near the refrigerator. There are two names on it:
BRAD/STACY. Brad's side is filled with messages.
Stacy's is empty.

She notices a summer bouquet floral arrangement.
Stacy reads the attached note. It reads: "Memories
of You, Ron Johnson." She quickly gathers it up and
carries it back outside. She fans the door several
times to dispel the odor.EXT. HAMILTON DRIVEWAY - AFTERNOONSTACYBrad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?BRADThey're not home yet.STACYBrad, what would you say if I asked
	you to just put these flowers in
	the trunk of the Cruising Vessel
	and get rid of them at work?BRADI'd say... who the hell is Ron
	Johnson?STACYI'll explain everything later.

Brad nods, as Stacy pushes the flowers into his
arms.INT. DAMONE'S ROOM - AFTERNOONDamone expertly fills two glasses three-quarters
full of Kahlua, then adds a few drops of milk.
Music is playing on a nearby speaker. Damone hands
The Rat a drink and checks himself out in his
mirror.DAMONESee that moustache coming in, Rat?

There is only a hint of peach fuzz, but he grooms
it anyway.DAMONE (CONT'D)See? You can almost press it out.

Damone turns around. His friend is preoccupied.THE RATI am in love.

Damone takes a sip of his drink, looks at The Rat.DAMONEYou... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part
	pussy.THE RATWhat do you mean -- wuss? This girl
	is my exact type. It's her.
	Definitely her.DAMONE(distracted)
	It's definitely your mama.THE RATDamone, you gotta listen to me.

Damone quits puttering around his room with the
Kahlua and milk. He grabs a chair and straddles it.DAMONEAll right... where did you see her?THE RATShe's in my biology class.DAMONEDid you get her number?THE RATNo.DAMONEDid you get her name?THE RATNo. It's too soon.DAMONEIt's never too soon! Girls decide

	biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd
	like you to take your clothes off
	and jump on me?'DAMONE(thoughtfully)
	I would. Yeah.THE RATReally?DAMONEI can see it all now. This is going
	to be just like the girl you fell
	in love with at Fotomat this
	summer. You bought forty bucks of
	fuckin' film and you never even
	talked to her.THE RAT(woeful)
	You tell me, Mike. What do I do?DAMONEOkay. Okay.

	Here's what you do.

Damone gets up, moves to the door.DAMONE (CONT'D)You start from the second you walk
	into biology. Don't just walk...
	move across the room.

He saunters over to the chair.DAMONE (CONT'D)Don't talk to her. Let her know.
	Use your face. Use your body. Use
	everything. This is what I do. I
	just sent out the vibe and I have
	personally found that... girls do
	respond. Something happens.THE RATOf course something happens. You
	put the vibe out to thirty million
	chicks, you know something's gonna
	happen.DAMONEThat's the idea, Rat. That's The
	Attitude.THE RATThe Attitude? The Attitude dictates
	that you don't care if she comes,

Damone knocks down the rest of his drink, and we...DISSOLVETO:INT. CARL'S JR. KITCHEN - NIGHTWe see Brad operating at full throttle in the
kitchen, and taking a moment to sneak a kiss with
his girlfriend Lisa as she goes to the front
counter to open up a cash register. She allows him
only one kiss.LISAWere those flowers really for me,
	Brad?BRADOf course.LISAHow much did they cost?BRADDon't worry about it.

She gives him a kiss... on the cheek.BRAD (CONT'D)Let's go to the Point tonight.

She pulls away.LISAWhat's there to do at the Point?

Brad shifts his weight, tries to find the right
words.BRADWhat's there to do at the Point?
	God, Lisa, we've been going
	together almost two years, and...LISABrad. I don't want to have to use
	sex as a tool.BRADTool? Tool for what? We've been
	going together almost two years!LISAI don't want to talk about it here,
	Brad.

Brad prepares to respond. He squints his eyes,
prepares for a truly sizzling comeback, when Dennis
Taylor, short and prematurely balding assistant
manager of Carl's Jr., comes bustling out of his
back office. He quickly surveys the situation in
the kitchen.TAYLORHamilton! You have fifteen double
	cheese to box!

Lisa returns to her cashier post, leaving Brad's
last words stalled in his mouth.EXT. HAMILTON HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHTWe see the Hamilton's cul-de-sac home. All the
lights are off in the house at this hour. Except
for Brad's room.INT. BRAD'S ROOMBrad is alone in his room. He's prone on his neatly
made bed, reading a paperback book entitled Power
With Class. On the wall of Brad's room is a large
framed photo of a Carl's Jr. hamburger.

Brad hears a muffled knock at his door.BRADCome on in.

Stacy walks into Brad's room.STACYThanks for getting rid of those
	flowers.BRADDon't worry about it. Who sent the
	flowers?STACYIt's just some guy I met at
	Swenson's. You don't know him.BRADI don't care it you tell me or not.
	I got problems of my own.

He begins pacing.STACYIs everything okay at work?BRADAre you kidding? Work is great. I
	kill at work. I don't even mind Mom
	and Dad making me pay rent.STACYYou're going to break up with Lisa,
	aren't you?BRADI've been doing some thinking. It's
	my last school year. I'm a single,
	successful guy. I think I want my
	freedom.STACYWhy? Because she won't sleep with
	you?BRADWhere did you hear that?STACYI'm just guessing.BRADWell... it's true.STACYMaybe you just need to give her
	some time. She's so nice, Brad.
	Everybody loves Lisa.BRADEverybody loves Lisa. Everybody
	loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't
	have to be her boyfriend.

Suddenly, Stacy pops the question.STACYHey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?BRADWhy?STACYI don't know. I was just curious.BRADMaybe yes. Maybe no.STACYYou are a virgin!BRADI didn't say that.STACYBut your face did!

They laugh. Then Brad turns serious.BRADAre you still a virgin?STACYMaybe yes. Maybe no.BRADDon't give me that shit! I know
	you're still a virgin!

Stacy smiles and stands up. She playfully slaps her
brother on the arm and walks down the hallway to
her room. We can see there is less frill and lace
in Stacy's room. The junior high paperbacks are
gone. There are no dolls in sight.EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - NIGHTLinda and Stacy walk past rows of cars. Stacy stops
at a brown MG.STACYThere... There's his car. I know
	he's at work tonight. He hasn't
	come into Swenson's since he called
	my house. My mother told him I was
	still at high school, after I told
	him I was nineteen. I guess I
	should tell him I'm fifteen.LINDADon't you dare, you'll never hear
	from him again.STACYDoes Doug care that you're
	seventeen?LINDADoug sees beyond that stuff to what
	the person inside is like. That's

	eighteen.LINDABoy I am so glad to be through with
	all these games.

They enter the mall.INT. U.S. HISTORY CLASS - MORNINGWe are now several weeks into the school year. Mr.
Hand is dropping test papers on desks like they are
pieces of manure.MR. HANDC... D... F... F... F... three
	weeks we've been talking about the
	Platt Amendment. What are you
	people? On dope? A piece of
	legislation was introduced into
	Congress by Senator John Platt. It
	was passed in 1906. This amendment
	to our Constitution has a profound
	impact upon all of our daily
	liv....

Mr. Hand stops on a dime. He is like a champion
hunting dog that has just picked up the scent. He
scans the room.MR. HAND (CONT'D)Where is Jeff Spicoli?

There is silence in the U.S. history classroom.MR. HAND (CONT'D)I saw him earlier today near the
	200 Building bathrooms. Is he still
	on campus?

Silence.MR. HAND (CONT'D)Anyone?

One student sitting next to Stacy raises his hand.MR. HAND (CONT'D)Yes, Desmond?DESMONDI saw him by the food machines.MR. HANDHow long ago?DESMONDJust before class, sir...

Mr. Hand snaps his fingers, Hawaii Five-O style.MR. HANDOkay. Bring him in.

Desmond hustles out the door.MR. HAND (CONT'D)What is this fascination with
	truancy? What is it that gets
	inside your heads?

Mr. Hand begins to pace the aisles as he speaks.
Occasionally, for emphasis, he bends down to
lecture directly into the students' faces.MR. HAND (CONT'D)There are other teachers in this
	school who look the other way at
	truants. 
		(points to attendance clip
		on the doorway)
	It's a little game that you both
	play. They pretend they don't see
	you, you pretend you don't ditch.
	Who pays the price later? You.

Desmond returns to the room with a red-eyed Jeff
Spicoli.SPICOLIHey! Wait a minute! There's no
	birthday party for me here!MR. HANDThank you, Desmond.
		(to Spicoli)
	What's the reason for your truancy?SPICOLII couldn't make it in time.MR. HAND(in top form)
	You mean, you couldn't? Or you
	wouldn't?SPICOLII don't know, mon. The food lines
	took forever.MR. HANDFood will be eaten on your time!
		(pause)
	Why are you continuously late for
	this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you
	shamelessly waste my time like
	this?SPICOLII don't know.

Mr. Hand appears mesmerized. He then turns and
heads for the board. He writes in long, large
letters as he slams the chalk into the green board.
He writes: "I DON'T KNOW".MR. HANDI like that.

He stands back and admires it. He turns randomly to
Stacy.MR. HAND (CONT'D)Don't you like that, Miss Hamilton?STACYYes, sir.MR. HANDI really like that too. 'I don't
	know'... that's nice. 'Mr. Hand,
	will I pass this class?' 'Gee, Mr.
	Spicoli, I don't know'. I like
	that.
	I think I'm going to leave your
	words on this board for all my
	classes to enjoy. Giving you full
	credit, of course, Mr. Spicoli.

We hear the blare of the dismissal bell. Stacy and
the other students get up to leave. Spicoli stays
in place. He has just figured out a truly bitchin'
comeback... and his mouth is forming the first
word, when Mr. Hand cuts him off.MR. HAND (CONT'D)You can go now.

Hand turns back to his desk. The rest of the
students have already left. Spicoli's audience is
gone. He shrugs and lopes out the door.INT. RIDGEMONT MALL - AFTERNOONIt's Christmas time at the Ridgemont Mall. All
three tiers are strung with neon lights, and we
hear the sound of the bell-ringing Santas.INT. SWENSON'S - AFTERNOONStacy and Linda are enjoying a brief lull in the
Christmas season madness. They sit at the sundae
bar. Stacy looks forlorn, almost red-eyed, as she
makes a sundae.LINDAYou've got to get used to working
	Christmas. People are always
	screaming and yelling... then they
	get home and they're all
	Christmasy.STACYI think Christmas brings out the
	worst in people.LINDAI guess Ron hasn't called yet.STACYNot since November.

Linda nods her head, always the coach.LINDAStacy, it doesn't look good for the
	relationship.

Stacy continues making her ice cream, slapping the
scoops onto the stainless steel dish.STACY(sighs)
	Don't you think it meant anything
	to him. Even if I am fifteen?LINDAStacy. What does it matter? He's a
	stereo salesman. You want to marry
	him? You want to have kids with
	him? You want this guy to come
	home, fifty years old, and he's
	still got that little Pacific
	Stereo badge on? Come on.ANGLE ON GREGG AND CINDYwho are seated at a back table, feeding each other.

Stacy looks at her finished sundae.STACYI should quit this job. I'm going
	to get so fat working here...
	nobody will ever take me out.LINDAStacy. How many times do I have to
	tell you? You are really going to
	be beautiful... someday.STACYThanks a lot.

Linda punches Stacy lightly on the shoulder.LINDAHey -- Ron Johnson? It's his loss.

We follow Stacy, as she walks into the dining room
to serve the sundae.INT. WHEREHOUSE RECORDS - MALL - DAYWe see a group of buzz-cut young toughs, walking in
formation, hunched over, sneering and wearing
sleeveless U.S. Army fatigue jackets. None of these
damaged-looking kids is over the age of fourteen.
They pass to reveal this legend on their backs:LINCOLN SURF NAZIS.Angle on Mike Damone and Mark Ratner, who are
standing by the upcoming concert list posted on the
door to Wherehouse Records. Damone sees the Surf
Nazis pass, turns to Mark Ratner, who is still
wearing his Cinema Four jacket.DAMONEThe business is changing, Rat. I'll
	tell you, these kids today... they
	don't even listen to Aerosmith.THE RATI hear they all dress like that at
	Lincoln now.DAMONEThere used to be three or four of
	those guys. Now we see 'em every
	time we come to the mall.

Damone is approached by a couple of young ticket
Customers.CUSTOMER #1Got any Blue Oyster Cult tickets?DAMONENo Cult. I ate twenty-four pairs of
	Blue Oyster Cult tickets last time
	around. I was this close to working
	at 7-11. No Cult.

Suddenly we see all ticket business stop. Damone
and his customers see someone menacingly coming
directly for them. The small crowd parts as Charles
Jefferson, football duffel bag in hand, walks up.
With him is a thick, tough, miniature version of
himself. This is Little Charles. They both stop in
front of Damone.JEFFERSON(after long look)
	When is Earth, Wind and Fire
	coming?DAMONE(respectfully)
	I'm really not sure. I haven't
	heard anything yet, but I'll let
	you know the second there is the
	slightest news, sir.JEFFERSONI'm taking my little brother.DAMONEExcellent. So that will be two
	tickets... All right. Fine, sir.

Jefferson and L.C. push past the customers.CUSTOMER #2Wow. He really lives here. I
	thought he just flew in for the
	football games.DAMONE(gaining composure)
	Shit, he's my man. He knows where
	to come for tickets.

Damone turns to The Rat.DAMONE (CONT'D)Well, Rat. Are you ready for the
	moment of truth?

The Rat adjusts his jacket, and nods.THE RATShe is immune to my charms.

They walk together towards Swenson's, as The Rat
drapes his aqua-blue Cinema Four jacket around his
shoulders, like a French film director. Damone
walks a few steps, then stops Rat.DAMONEHey, Rat.THE RATYeah?DAMONEAce the jacket.

The Rat considers the suggestion, gets rid of the
jacket. They continue towards Swenson's.EXT. SWENSON'S - DAYThe Rat pulls open the door to Swenson's. He walks
toward the counter to Stacy Hamilton.STACYHi. May I help you?

The Rat feels the beginnings of cold panic, but
barges through nonetheless.THE RATYes. I have two questions. I was
	curious...

His voice becomes a shade deeper. He begins to pull
The Attitude together.THE RAT (CONT'D)What do you do with the jackets
	people leave here?STACY(smiling)
	We keep them.THE RATYou keep them.STACYWe keep them, in case the people
	come back.

She reaches under the counter and pulls out a
cardboard box with some rumbled jackets and other
items.STACY (CONT'D)Here they are. You can look through
	it, if you want.

The Rat chuckles to himself, struggling with The
Attitude.THE RATIt's cool. It would take too much
	time to go through all that stuff.
	I'll just pick up a new one.

Stacy smiles. He's obviously awkward, and she likes
it.STACYWhat's your other question?THE RATMy other question is... can-I-have
	your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you
	out-sometime?

To The Rat's surprise, Stacy continues smiling.STACYDo you have a pen? This one's out
	of ink.THE RATOh... yes.

He pulls one out of his jacket pocket, gives it to
her. Stacy writes her name and phone number on a
scrap of paper and gives it to him. The Rat looks
at the paper.THE RAT (CONT'D)Stacy. Nice to meet you, Stacy. My
	name is Mark Ratner.

He sticks out his hand, and they shake. We see The
Rat turn around and walk out of Swenson's.EXT. SWENSON'S - AFTERNOONThe Rat exits with ultimate cool. He sees Damone
waiting just off to the side, talking to some
girls. The Rat nods, gives him the thumbs-up.
Damone returns the gesture. All-Attitude.EXT. CARL'S JR. - MORNINGCarl's is happening tonight. There are lots of kids
inside. We hear charging rock music -- "Girls Got
Rhythm" by AC/DC -- coming from a radio in the back
kitchen.INT. CARL'S JR. BATHROOM - MORNINGInside the bathroom, Brad Hamilton applies the
Carl's scrub brush to a felt tip graffiti message
near the mirror: I EAT BIG HAIRY PUSSY. He pauses
and catches himself in the mirror. He adjusts his
hair.BRAD(talking to mirror) 
	Lisa? I have something to tell you.
	Look, I'm a senior now.
	I'm a single, successful guy and
	I've got to be fair to myself.
	Lisa... I think I need my freedom.

Brad pauses, looks at the mirror soulfully.BRAD (CONT'D)Aw, don't do that... don't take it
	personally, okay? Please? I knew
	you'd understand, because...

The bathroom door opens -- it's Arnold, the boy who
Brad got a job.ARNOLDBrad! I know you're on your break,
	but would you cover me on register
	three?

Brad nods, exits:INT. CARL'S JR. COUNTERBrad stands at the register.

We see a prominent display over Brad's head: TRY
OUR 100% GUARANTEED BREAKFAST. The last of many
harried businessmen customers gets his breakfast
order and takes his seat.

Brad is joined by Dennis Taylor, the Assistant
Manager.DENNISCome on. Clean that counter off
	Brad. Let's go. Play ball.BRADOkay, Dennis.

Brad begins polishing the counter and Dennis Taylor
returns to his office at the back of the kitchen.

Brad watches him disappear behind the door that
says: ASSISTANT MANAGER.

As soon as Dennis disappears behind the door, the
one Businessman in the place rises and returns to
the counter.BRAD (CONT'D)(nervously)
	May I help you?

The Businessman has short, curly brown hair. He
speaks in a whine.BUSINESSMANYes. This is not the best breakfast
	I ever ate.

The Businessman points to the huge display over
Brad's head: TRY OUR 100% GUARANTEED BREAKFAST.BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)And I want my money back.

Brad begins searching under the counter.BRADWell, I believe you have to fill
	out a form. There's a pad right
	around here.BUSINESSMANNo. I want my money back right now.BRADWell, that's not the way it works,
	really. And you ate most of your
	food already, too...BUSINESSMANSee that sign? It says 100% Money
	Back Guarantee. Do you know the
	meaning of the word 'guarantee'? Do
	they teach you that here? Give me
	my money back.

Brad begins looking to the restroom. "Where's
Arnold?"BRADI can't do that. But if you wait a
	minute...BUSINESSMAN(as if talking to a
		kindergartner)
	Look. Just put your little hand
	back in the cash register and give
	me my $2.75 back. Okay? 
		(looks at name tag)
	Please, Brad?BRADI'm sorry, sir. Just let me find
	the forms here.BUSINESSMANI am so tired. I am so tired of
	dealing with morons. How hard is it
	to...

Brad looks up from under the counter. No amount of
pay will make him take that kind of insult.BRADMister, if you don't shut up, I'm
	gonna kick 100% of your ass.BUSINESSMANManager!!

"Bam!" The door to the Assistant Manager's office
swings open, and Dennis comes hurtling out of the
back.DENNISCan I help you, sir? Is there a
	problem?BUSINESSMANYou bet there's a problem! Your
	employee used profanity and
	threatened me with violence! I'm
	shocked, frankly. I've eaten here
	many times and I've always enjoyed
	the service -- until today!

Angle on bathroom door as it opens and Arnold
starts towards the register. He quickly sees the
incident with the irate Businessman and ducks back
inside the bathroom.BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)All I wanted was my money back for
	this breakfast. It was a little
	undercooked. And this young man
	threatened me. Now I plan to write
	a letter! I plan to...

Dennis wheels around to Brad.DENNISDid you threaten this man or use
	profanity in any way?BRADHe insulted me first. He called me
	a moron.DENNISDid you threaten this customer or
	use profanity in any way?BRADYes, sir.DENNISYou're fired.

Brad looks around, expecting his friends to defend
him. Dave and Rich seem very occupied with their
work. Brad is stunned.DENNIS (CONT'D)(to Businessman)
	I'm very sorry this happened to
	you, sir.BUSINESSMANThank you very much.

Then Brad unhooks his fryer's apron and throws it
on the counter. He grabs a backpack and walks out
of the place. On the way, he bangs the bathroom
door with his fist.BRADI hope you had a hell of a piss,
	Arnold.DISSOLVETO:INT. BRAD'S ROOM - DAYHe arrives back in his room and locks the door. He
yanks the burger picture off his wall, dumps it
into the trash. Then he takes it back out of the
trash and cracks the cardboard picture and plastic
frame in half.DARKNESSWe are in the middle of a deep, dark void. After a
moment, a pinprick of light appears in the
distance. We head towards the light. We are being
led somewhere important.

As we draw still closer, curtains suddenly part to
reveal a wildly cheering studio audience. We hear
the voice of Merv Griffin.MERV GRIFFIN (O.S.)Will you please give a warm welcome
	to... Jeff Spicoli!

The Merv Griffin Show band begins playing a Merv
Griffin Show version of AC/DC's "Highway to Hell".
Someone hands Jeff Spicoli a microphone. He works
the studio audience into a frenzy as he sings the
words to "Highway to Hell": Merv Griffin show
style.SPICOLI(singing)
	'Layin' ladies!		   
	Drinkin' wine!

	You and me -- It's get down time!
	We're on the Highway to Hell!   
	The Highway to Hell!'

Spicoli finishes up with a spectular pump. The
audience goes wild as Merv Griffin greets him
warmly, and guides Spicoli to his seat. Spicoli
motions for the cheers to die down. Griffin is
obviously happy to see him. He touches Spicoli's
arm lightly.GRIFFINHow've you been?SPICOLIOutrageous, Merv. Nice to be here.
	I feel great.GRIFFINI was going to say... your eyes
	look a little red.SPICOLII've been swimming, Merv.

The audience howls. It's a famous Spicoli line.SPICOLI (CONT'D)Seriously, Merv, everything is
	great.
	I was thinking about picking up
	some hash this weekend, maybe going
	up to the mountains.GRIFFIN(concerned)
	I wanted to talk a little bit about
	school, if I could...SPICOLISchool.

	to do is go to get the grades. And
	if you know something, all you have

The audience is howling again. He is Merv's
favorite guest.GRIFFINI hear you brought a film clip with
	you. Do you want to set it up for
	us?SPICOLIWell, it pretty much speaks for
	itself. Peter, you want to run with

A tiny figure appears at the foot of the wave.GRIFFIN (CONT'D)Who's that?SPICOLIThat's me, Merv.

The audience gasps.GRIFFIN (V.O.)Are you going to ride that wave?SPICOLITotally.

We watch as Spicoli catches the perfect wave, and
it hurtles him through a turquoise tube of water.GRIFFINWhat's going through your mind
	right here, Jeff? The danger of it
	all?SPICOLIMerv, I'm thinking... I've only got
	about four good hours of surfing
	left before these little clowns
	from junior high start showing up
	with their boogie boards.

The audience is howling once again... when suddenly
we hear the loud noise of a door opening, followed
by a shrill voice. It is Spicoli's eight-year-old
brother, Curtis.

Jeff Spicoli's dream of glory evaporates.INT. SPICOLI'S TRAILER HOME - MORNINGIt is a messy trailer, part of a trailer park by
the sea. Spicoli's area is small, but he has made
it his own. The walls are covered with posters,
almost all of them naked centerfolds. It is obvious
Spicoli's parents are not welcome in his room.CURTISDad says you have to get up!SPICOLIUgh.

He groans, starts to struggle out of bed.SPICOLI (CONT'D)Leave me alone!CURTISDad says you're late again, you
	butthole!SPICOLILeave me alone.CURTISDad says!

Spicoli reaches over to the floor next to his bed.
He pulls a snorkel from the mess, heaves it at the
door and his little brother. It bounces off the
wall and doesn't even hit Curtis, but the kid
starts crying anyway.CURTIS (CONT'D)Daaaaaaaad! Jeff threw a snorkel at
	me!!!!!!

Spicoli gets out of bed, groans again, and kicks
the door shut.EXT. RIDGEMONT GYMNASIUMcelebrating the big game with rival Lincoln High
School. We see Jeff Spicoli stumble from the
direction of the parking lot. He heads into the
gym, which is already full for a mandatory
assembly.INT. GYMNASIUM - DOORWAY - DAYSpicoli wanders into the assembly, takes a seat on
a corner bleacher. He sits just below Brad Hamilton
and Lisa.

On podium in front of assembly, Cindy Carr and
another cheerleader, Dina Phillips, are making a
presentation before the school.CINDYI just want to say that we are not
	'Spirit Bunnies' anymore. We always
	hated that name. It bugged the heck
	out of Dina and me...DINAIt's just such a put down.CINDYThey don't call the Chess Club

They sit in silence for a moment.BRAD (CONT'D)I'm just glad we're still together,
	Lisa, because I need you this year.LISA(sighs)
	Look, Brad, I've been trying to
	think of a way to tell you this.
	We're almost out of high school,
	this is our last year. I think we
	owe it to ourselves to be free, and
	meet some new people. Then, if we

	this entire school. Allll-Riiiight?

There is unenthusiastic, minor applause from the
assembled students of Ridgemont High. Vice
Principal Ray Connors, a tough-looking man with an
H.R. Haldeman crew cut, approaches the podium. He
has a sour look on his face.CONNORSWell, thank you, girls. People,
	don't forget, the big game is one
	week away. We'll see everybody back
	here on Monday and have a good
	weekend.

For the first time during this assembly, there is a
loud and hearty applause.A GRAINY HIGH SCHOOL FILM 57We are suddenly watching a movie shown on a class
projection screen. We see footage of a serene,
middle-class neighborhood -- as seen through the
glass windshield of a car. Judging from the other
vehicles parked on the street, the film is from the
early Sixties. We hear the narrative voice of Desi
Arnaz, speaking in his inimitable Latin accent.ARNAZDriving ess an important part of
	each and every one of our da-ily
	lives. Ees a responsibility like no
	o-ther and ess a matter of life
	and...

A ball comes rolling out into the serene street. A
small child runs out after it. The driving of our
vehicle brakes, but not in time. The film freeze
frames on the terrified face of a child about to be
splattered.ARNAZ (CONT'D)Death.

There is a swell of dramatic music.ARNAZ (CONT'D)They have foun'... The Braking
	Point.

The words flash on the screen and we hear a high
school Driver's Training class groan in mock
horror.INT. DRIVER TRAINING CLASS - DAYANGLE ON CHARLES JEFFERSON AND BRAD HAMILTONwho are seated in this class.ANGLE ON LINDA AND STACYsitting together in the class. They are oblivious,
lost in conversation.STACYWhat do you think of that guy who

Linda looks nauseous.LINDAJust watch out if he pulls up in a
	van, and then puts on a Led
	Zeppelin tape.INT. DRIVER TRAINING CLASSThe film returns to another serene street scene as
seen through another front windshield.ARNAZThe driver here has had jus' two
	drinks. Two drinks at the home of a
	frien'.

We hear the very-present sounds of Driver's
Training students.STUDENT #1He's fucked-up, Ricky!STUDENT #2They guys a drunk, Ricky!ARNAZAnd although this driver thinks he
	ees drivin' well, he may be 'doing
	okay, but he forgets to per-ceive
	what ees real goin' on...

In the film, another car comes barreling from the
left, running a stop sign and exploding into the
side of the two-drink goner. In the class, the
Driver's Training students are howling.EXT. RIDGEMONT MALL - EARLY EVENINGThe parking lot is full. Kids and shoppers stream
through the entrance in groups of all sizes.INT. RIDGEMONT MALLAll three levels are teeming with kids.ANGLE ON THE VIDEO PINBALL ARCADEwhere we see Jeff Spicoli manning the Missile
Command machine. Spicoli wears a red bandana across
his forehead. A cigarette dangles from his mouth.
He is surrounded by a fleet of young surfers who
listen to him with reverence.SPICOLIBe noble. Be aggressive. The thing
	about Missile Command is to
	decimate before you can be
	decimated. Just like in real life. 

The youngsters hang on every word of the sage
advice.ANGLE ON A GANG OF SURF NAZISwalking in formation.ANGLE ON MIKE DAMONE AND MARK RATNERwalking the mall.DAMONECheck it out, Rat. The Surf
	Nazis... out for a Sunday stroll.

Damone and The Rat walk on. The Rat is barely
interested. He appears deep in thought.THE RATWhat do I say after she gets in the
	car?

Damone, obviously in his element here at the mall,
stops to flash a winning smile at a well-built
older housewife.DAMONENo problem, Rat. What you need is
	my special Five Point Plan.

As he talks, Damone passes a Country Farms shop. He
plucks a free sample of cheese and sausage.THE RATKnock it off, Damone. I need real
	help.DAMONEWhat do you mean? Men have died
	trying to obtain this information.
	I will give it to you for free.

The Rat and Damone continue on.THE RATOkay. Tell me. What's the Five
	Point Plan?DAMONEAll right. Pay attention.

The Rat nods, always the student, as they pass a
Wherehouse Record store. Damone stops right in
front of a seductively posed life-sized cardboard
stand-up of Debbie Harry, the alluring rock singer.

Damone begins his speech.DAMONE (CONT'D)First of all, Rat... never let on
	how much you like a girl.

Damone turns to the cardboard cutout of Debbie
Harry to demonstrate.DAMONE (CONT'D)(disinterested)
	Oh. Hi.

	Two. Always call the shots.

He turns to Debbie Harry, who looks on with an
inviting cardboard smile.DAMONE (CONT'D)Kiss me.

	that's the place to be.

	And the lady will have...

	When you get down to making out,
	whenever possible, put on the first

	Rat. Voila. You can't miss.THE RATI think I've got it. Once I get
	going, I'll be okay. But... how do
	I get started? I mean, I hardly
	know her.DAMONEYou wuss. It's no problem. One
	person says something to the other
	and that's how it starts...

Standing there in the front of the Wherehouse, The
Rat nods his head and smiles. He's finally
beginning to understand, and we...CUT TO:EXT. THE RAT'S CAR - LATER THAT NIGHTWe see The Rat behind the wheel of a green Volvo.

lobster house called The Atlantis.THE RATJoey at Cinema Four said this is a
	pretty good restaurant.STACYI've heard that, too.

The Rat finds a parking spot near the back of the
lot, grateful that the long silence is over. He
walks with Stacy to the front of The Atlantis.INT. THE ATLANTIS - NIGHTThe Rat and Stacy are escorted by the host to a
nearby table. They are given large wooden menus.THE RATDo you know what you want?STACYI think I'll have the Seafood Salad
	Special.THE RATExcellent.

The Rat leans back in the booth. He is starting to
feel in control now. Then something hits him. The
panic sweeps across his face.

Slowly, The Rat reaches back to check his wallet.
It's gone.STACYAre you all right?THE RAT(weakly)
	Oh yeah.

Cool. Cool was the name of the game. Stay cool.THE RAT (CONT'D)Do you mind if I excuse myself for
	a moment?STACYNot at all.

Just as The Rat is about to get up, the Waitress
approaches the table.WAITRESSAre you ready to order here?THE RATWell... sure.

	She will have the Seafood Salad
	Special. And I will have... the
	same.WAITRESSAnything to drink?THE RATTwo Cokes.WAITRESSOkay. Thanks.

The Rat gets back up again, looking paler by the
minute. He excuses himself and walks over to the
pay phone by the Atlantis toilets.

The Rat dials a number. Damone answers.INT. DAMONE'S ROOM - NIGHTHe is sitting in a chair, leaning onto the back two
legs, watching television.DAMONEYo.THE RAT (V.O.)Damone. It's Mark.DAMONEMark. What happened to your date?THE RATIt's happening right now. I'm here
	at the Atlantis. Everything's fine

	never ask you for anything again in
	this lifetime or any other. Will
	you please borrow your mom's car,
	go by my house, get my wallet, and

	I'm really pretty busy...ANGLE ON DAMONE'S TELEVISIONas we see the flickering images of Leave It To
Beaver.DAMONE (CONT'D)You owe me for this one.INT. ATLANTISThe Rat hangs up, mildly relieved, and returns to
the table.DISSOLVETO:INT. STACY AND THE RAT'S TABLE - AN HOUR LATERThe Rat and Stacy have finished the meal, and
desert.ANGLE ON THE CHECKas it sits in a little tray before The Rat.

The Waitress approaches the table. It is clear she
wants to make room for other customers and bigger
tips.WAITRESSAre you sure there's nothing else I
	can bring you?THE RATI'll have one more Coke... Do you
	want another Coke, Stacy?STACY(quizzical) )
	Sure. I'll... have another Coke.THE RATTwo more Cokes.WAITRESS(sarcastic)
	Two... more... Cokes.ANGLE ON FRONT DOORas Mike Damone finally walks in. Damone looks over
the diners, then feigns great surprise when he sees
The Rat.DAMONEHey, Mark. Is that you?THE RATDamone! You come here?DAMONEI come for the seafood. It's great!
	Hey... you know what, Mark? I found
	your wallet the other day. You want
	it back?THE RATWow. I've been looking for that
	thing! Hey, Damone, have you met
	Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike
	Damone.

Stacy smiles politely, with the slightest sparkle
in her eye, as the Waitress returns with the two
Cokes.DAMONEWell, I've gotta be running.THE RATOkay. See ya.ANGLE ON STACYlooking strangely at the proceedings.DAMONENice to meet you, Stacy.STACYNice to meet you.

Damone leaves. The Rat takes a few quick gulps of
Coke, and gets up to pay the bill. As he moves out
of camera range, we see the strange look on the
faces of waitresses and diners.INT. THE RAT'S CAR - LATE EVENINGThe Rat pulls up to Stacy's house in the cul-de
sac. He stares straight ahead, like a zombie.THE RATI had a really nice time tonight.STACYMe, too. I'm real sorry someone
	broke in and stole your tape deck.

The Rat nods glumly.THE RATI never thought it would happen at
	The Atlantis. Jeez.STACYDo you want to come inside?THE RATAren't your parents asleep?STACYNo, they're away for the weekend.
	Brad and I are watching the house.THE RATOkay. Sure. I'll come in.

We see a confused but interested look on The Rat's
face.INT. THE HAMILTON HOUSE - EVENINGThey walk in the front door. The Rat stands
uncomfortably in the doorway to the living room.THE RATWhere's your brother?STACYI don't know. Probably out. Want
	something to drink?THE RATNo. That's okay.STACYWell, I'm going to change real
	quick. I hope you don't mind.THE RATNaw. I don't mind.

Stacy turns her back and pulls up her hair.STACYWill you unzip me?ANGLE ON THE RAT'S FACEas the wheels inside his mind start to spin. This
can't be what it seems. He unzips Stacy, past her
bra, down to the small of her back. It's the first
time he's ever done anything like that.STACY (CONT'D)Thanks!

She walks down the hall to her room, easing out of
her dress as she walks. She leaves the door to her
room open.STACY (CONT'D)You can come in, if you want!ANGLE ON THE RAT'S FACEHe is completely unsure of himself, as he begins to
walk down the hall. His heart pounds into his
throat. He turns the corner and steps into Stacy's
room.INT. STACY'S ROOM - NIGHTStacy stands there, looking gorgeous in an almost
seethrough white robe. The Rat pretends not to
notice.THE RATSo... pretty nice house you've got
	here.STACYThanks. So... 
		(puts hands on hips)
	What do you want to do?ANGLE ON THE RAT'S FACEas he struggles with the memory of Damone's words.
"Always call the shots."THE RATI don't know.STACYDo you want to see some pictures? I
	kept a lot of scrapbooks and
	pictures and stuff from junior
	high. How stupid, right?THE RATSure.

Stacy goes to her closet, reaches up to grab the
books from the top shelf. The Rat watches her robe
slip up her legs. Then she sits down next to him.
Her knee grazes his. It is almost too much for The
Rat. Go for it. We see The Rat struggle with the
action of putting his arm around her. He almost
does, but then reacts as she says suddenly...STACYThis is me in the eighth grade. Did
	you have Mr. Deegan?THE RAT(looking pained)
	Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.

Her knee grazes him again. Does she expect
something?THE RAT (CONT'D)Look, Stacy, I want you to know
	that...

The Rat struggles. Try as he might, he can't seem
to cross the line. He can't make his move. He is
woeful as he completes the sentence.THE RAT (CONT'D)... I've got to go home.STACYDo you really have to go?THE RATWell... it's getting kind of late.

Suddenly, The Rat is seized with ambition. He
reaches one hand around her right shoulder and
plants the other hand directly on her left breast.
It looks something like a wrestling hold. The Rat
looks at Stacy. Stacy looks back at The Rat. The
Rat is absolutely frozen.STACYI guess it is getting late, Mark.

She shrugs him off, walks him to the door.EXT. THE HAMILTON HOME - NIGHTWe see The Rat's forlorn face as he trudges towards
his car. He stops. He takes a breath -- it wasn't
that late, he really didn't want to leave. The Rat
turns and begins walking back up the Hamilton
steps. Just as he does so, Stacy's bedroom light
clicks off. It was too late. He kicks at his car.THE RATYou blew it, asshole.

Behind him, recklessly speeding towards Ridgemont
Drive, is Charles Jefferson's blue Mustang.EXT./INT. THE BLUE MUSTANG - NIGHTJeff Spicoli is behind the wheel. Sitting next to
him is Little Charles, "L.C.", Jefferson's younger
brother. They're smoking grass and holding
Lowenbrau beers in between their legs. The radio is
blasting the music of Rick James.L.C.Hey, slow down. This is my
	brother's car.SPICOLII thought he was out of town.L.C.He is.SPICOLIThen don't hassle it.

They speed off down Ridgemont.L.C.Seen the new Playboy?SPICOLINaw. Any good?L.C.Suzanne Somers' tits.SPICOLIAll right.L.C.I like sex.

Spicoli sees something in the rearview mirror.SPICOLIHold your beer down, L.C., I think
	it's a cop.

Spicoli slows down. The car behind him slows down.SPICOLI (CONT'D)This is a cop. He's definitely
	cruising me at busting distance.

The high beams switch on behind Spicoli.SPICOLI (CONT'D)What the fuck is this guy doing?

The car behind Spicoli then advances to the point
where it is now almost touching the blue Mustang.SPICOLI (CONT'D)What the fuck is this guy doing?L.C.This ain't no cop.

The mystery car bumps them lightly from behind.L.C. (CONT'D)Hey! He's gonna scratch my
	brother's car!

The two boys start yelling. High beams fill the
Mustang with bright light and...EXT./INT. MUSTANG AND GRANADAThen mystery car pulls back, then up alongside
Spicoli and L.C. on the left. We hear the music on
the radio of George Thoroughgood's "Ride On,
Josephine".SPICOLIIt's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!L.C.They're fuckin' with us.

The drivers of the two cars eye each others. Then
the Granada begins inching over, trying to force
Spicoli off the road.L.C. (CONT'D)My brother's car!SPICOLIAll right. Die, Granada Jocks!

Spicoli guns ahead, in a real bullet move, and
easily overtakes the Granada. Spicoli is proud of
himself. He checks himself out in the rearview and
turns to L.C.SPICOLI (CONT'D)Would you roll your window up,
	L.C.? It's messing my hair.

Spicoli pulls way ahead of the Granada, while L.C.
rolls his window up. Spicoli looks over to L.C. and
smiles wickedly.

Now Spicoli wants to show off. He pushes the pedal
to the floor.L.C.We just missed the turnoff to the
	party.SPICOLIYou know the thing I love about
	Mustangs? The steering wheel.

Spicoli fingers the bubbles in the wheel.SPICOLI (CONT'D)With a genuine Mustang steering
	wheel, you can negotiate a hairpin
	turn with ease, my man.EXT./INT. MUSTANGon the word "ease", Spicoli curls his finger into
one of the Mustang steering wheel bubbles and whips
it clockwise. The idea is to turn off onto a side
street and head back to the party. But instead, at
the moment of the hairpin turn, L.C. is attempting
to switch the radio station. Spicoli crooks his
finger farther into the bubble than he expected.
The car swings in a complete circle, a circle that
includes a bright yellow fire hydrant. The hydrant
rips the side of the car open like a can of tuna.
There is a silent moment of terror.SPICOLIAre you okay?

There is silence. Outside the smashed car, the
Granada Jocks pass Spicoli and L.C.GRANADA JOCKSFuck youuuuuuuuuu!

Then L.C. stirs and utters his first words.L.C.My brother is going to kill us.
	He's gonna kill you and then he's
	gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.SPICOLIJust be glad you're all right.L.C.My brother is gonna shit.SPICOLIMake up your mind. Is he gonna
	shit, or is he gonna kill us?L.C.First he's gonna shit. And then
	he's gonna kill us..SPICOLIWill you just relax, mon? He's not

scrap iron.SPICOLII can fix it.MONTAGE OF SHOTSas we see Ridgemont High gearing up for its big
Homecoming Game against Lincoln. We see a series of
shots of kids talking about it, wagering on the
chances of a Ridgemont victory. We see the many
signs and placards all over school, proclaiming
Ridgemont revenge. We see students lining up to
vote for Homecoming King and Queen in the
gymnasium. It is the most spirit that Ridgemont has
shown this year.DISSOLVETO:EXT. RIDGEMONT SCHOOL - FLAGPOLE - DAYFrom the back of the parking lot, we see a crowd
around the flagpole. A group of kids are staring at
something. They sadly shake their heads at the
sight, as if they are witnessing a funeral.

As we draw closer, we see the center of commotion.
It is an ugly sight. Someone had wrecked Charles
Jefferson's Blue Scholarship Mustang and welded it
to the flagpole. Spray-painted on the side was the
message: LINCOLN SURF PUNKS RULE.EXT. RIDGEMONT BLEACHERS - NIGHTThe Ridgemont football bleachers are full of
cheering students. We see the same basic groups
from lunch court, and many more.

The cheerleaders are on the field -- Cindy Carr,
Dina Phillips and company -- and their cheerleader
"husbands" sit directly in front of them in the
stands. Linda and Stacy sit in the bleachers with
some of the Swenson's girls. The Rat and Damone sit
several rows above them, watching. The teachers sit
together in another section.ANGLE ON BRAD HAMILTONwho is again sitting alone in the bleachers.

	Later.EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - THE GAME - NIGHTEveryone is cheering the amazing game on the field.
Charles Jefferson is poised on the offensive line.
He mutters a string of obscenities at the opposing
Lincoln player. The ball is snapped, and Charles
Jefferson comes directly at the player with both
elbows up and angled to hit inside his helmet. The
Lincoln player is hit and keels over.

Charles Jefferson sets up for another play. The
ball is snapped. Ka-boom. Down falls another
Lincoln player. Jefferson doesn't know who it was
who wrecked his Mustang, but he wasn't about to
spare any of them. There is pure madness in his
eyes. It has taken him over.

Linda stops applying lotion, considers that

	about Doug.

They laugh. Linda resumes applying the lotion.
Stacy continues reading the book. A couple of beats
pass.STACYHow long does Doug take?LINDAI don't know. Thirty to forty
	minutes.STACY(pause)

Stacy looks at Linda, almost disbelieving.LINDA (CONT'D)(wistful)
	He's no high school boy.

There is a noise by the side fence leading into the
Hamiltons' backyard. It is Mark Ratner and Mike
Damone. They are already wearing swimsuits.DAMONEHey! We came over to help you with
	Math homework!STACYOh, really?THE RATReally. We figured you needed the
	help. On such a hot day.

Stacy quickly stashes the book in a stack of towels
beside her. She leans over to Linda and speaks
confidentially.STACYWhat do you think?LINDAI think they're both virgins.

Stacy smiles, gets up and goes over to the fence.STACYI didn't ask for any help. Did you,
	Linda?LINDANo.DAMONEWell, that's exactly why I brought
	some Wisk for the jacuzzi.STACYO-kay, you guys can come swimming.
	But you have to leave as soon as my
	Mom gets home. Okay?EXT. HAMILTON POOLMike Damone yells "banzai!" and dives into the
small pool. At one end of the pool is the jacuzzi,
which is separated by a tile wall. Damone has
already poured the Wisk into the jacuzzi, and the
detergent has created a huge bubble bath effect.
Damone surfaces and flips into the jacuzzi.

Stacy, looking great in a green bikini, sits
kicking her legs by the side of the pool. Linda
stands on the board. She is poised to dive. The Rat
treads water and stares at both girls. Inside the
Hamilton living room, the family stereo plays the
music of Deep Purple's "Woman From Tokyo".DAMONEHey, Linda! I'll judge your dive.
	I'm a champion diver myself.

Brad arrives home by the side gate and slams it
behind him. He is home from a bad day at work. He
walks out onto the patio and stands with his hands
on his hips. For the first time, our former campus
hero looks absurd. He is still in his uniform from
Captain Kidd Fish and Chips -- it is a blue and
white striped Pirates of the Caribbean outfit,
complete with black plastic sword at the side, and
a ridiculously large Ponce de Leon-esque hat. Brad
carries the hat under his arm.BRADDoes Mom know you have company?STACYIt's just Linda. And Mark from
	school.

Brad ignores the underclassmen, and notices Linda
on the board in her maroon bikini. He smiles.BRADHi, Linda.LINDAHi, Brad.BRADWell, you guys, keep it down. I've
	got some work to do upstairs.

Brad turns and heads back inside. He is just out of
earshot when they begin talking about him.LINDAGod, he hardly even talks anymore.STACYI know. He hates to have to wear
	uniforms.DAMONEPoor guy.THE RATReally.

Stacy breaks the spell by jumping into the water,

Linda towels off and heads back inside the Hamilton
house. She knows how to walk.INT. BRAD'S BEDROOM AND BATHROOM - AFTERNOONWe see Brad's room. The Carl's burger picture on

playing from his stereo -- Pink Floyd's "You and

We see Brad. He is kneeling on the bathroom floor,
his back to us. His green T-shirt is on, his
underwear in a pile on the floor behind him. His
arm is pumping slowly. Brad is jacking off.DISSOLVETO:EXT. HAMILTON POOL - BRAD'S DAYDREAMIt features Linda Barrett, just as she stood on the
diving board a moment ago. She is gorgeous. Her
breasts seem even bigger than usual. Her nipples
are hard, poking through the film maroon string

the corners of her mouth. Her lips are parted
slightly. Her eyes are filled with desire as she
says...LINDAHi, Brad.

him away, so he can watch as she carefully unstraps
the top of her bathing suit. The incredible Linda
Barrett's breasts fall loose.

She takes Brad's hands and places them on her, as
she begins unbuttoning his shirt. They are just
about to fall into passionate lovemaking when we

Then he produces yet another crumpled dollar, and
presses it into the Delivery Man's hand.SPICOLI (CONT'D)For you, my man.

Mr. Hand snatches up the pizza, and starts to throw
it in the wastebasket. Then he thinks better, and
heads for the door. He opens it just as a gang of
young Stoners walk past.STONER #1There's the pizza.STONER #2Totally!

Brad dutifully unhooks his apron, to reveal the
bottom half of his pirate suit.BRADJust write me out a bill.

While Harold leans down to tally up the fish order,
Brad goes to a nearby employee's closet. He has
completely perfected the art of changing back into
his street clothes, and it takes less than a
minute. He is just about to finish buttoning his
street shirt when Harold sees him.HAROLDHamilton, come over here. What is
	that you've got on?BRADThis is how I dress all the time.HAROLDBut you took off your Captain Kidd

music of Bruce Springsteen's "Out in the Streets."
He pries open one of the fourteen Catch-of-the-Day

piece of fried fish. Brad takes a bite.
The look on his face says it is the worst piece of
shit he has ever tasted. He throws the piece out
the window, and drives on.

we see the body of Arthur. The students' eyes
widen. Some gasp. Others cover their mouths. Others
begin furious notes. Nobody speaks. The body of
Arthur is smallish and withered. It is orange,
flaky, and not quite real looking. A deep cut has
been made in Arthur's chest.

Mr. Vargas bends Arthur upright for a better
student view. He gestures to the deep cut made in
Arthur's chest.

	he say... What did you say... How
	much did it cost? Look, tell him he
	can have a relationship with you or
	a 'more open' relationship with
	someone else... Listen, Debbie, can
	I call you later. I'm waiting for
	Doug to call.

She plops back on the couch with Stacy.LINDA (CONT'D)I'll bet he forgets to call again.

She notices that Stacy is crying over the TV show.LINDA (CONT'D)God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's
	just David Soul and Ricardo
	Montalban.STACYI don't know, I'm just so
	depressed. Everything is just so...
	depressing.

Linda shuts off the television.LINDAYou have been acting very strange
	the last few weeks.STACYI don't know... I just don't feel
	right.

Linda sits down next to Stacy on the bed.LINDAWhat do you think it is?STACYWhat do you think it is?LINDAIt couldn't be.STACYIt could be. I had a pregnancy test
	at the clinic. I'll find out
	Monday. I guess it was Damone.LINDAOf course it was Damone. If it was
	Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!STACYI'm not going to tell him. He's an
	asshole. I hate him.LINDABut it costs money to have an
	abortion. Even at the Free Clinic.
	You tell Damone to pay for it. It's
	the least he can do. It's the guy's
	responsibility too.

She puts the TV back on and they watch.STACYYou know, there's one thing you
	didn't tell me about guys.LINDAWhat?STACYYou didn't tell me that they can be
	so nice, so great... but then you
	sleep with them and they start
	acting like they're five years old.LINDAYou're right. I didn't tell you
	that.EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - TWO DAYS LATERStacy Hamilton is walking towards Mike Damone on

timing track runners.DAMONEWhat's going on?STACYMike, there's something that's been
	on my mind and I have to tell you

decides to try a more mature tact.DAMONE (CONT'D)There's only one thing we can do.
	We've got to get rid of it. We've
	got to get an abortion.STACYWe've got to get an abortion?DAMONEYeah. My brother Art got his
	girlfriend one once.STACYIt's already planned, Mike. It's
	going to cost $150 at the Free

Rick. Then he counts through the money. Seventy
five dollars exactly. He crosses out REO Speedwagon
tickets. This leaves him no money for the abortion.EXT. STREET CORNER - AFTERNOONHere, at the same corner where she once waited for
Ron Johnson, Stacy waits for Damone. Cars pass, no
Damone.INT. HAMILTON HOUSE - AFTERNOONStacy is on the phone, calling Damone. We see the
phone messages sheet that lists two calls for
Stacy, and none for Brad. The line rings four
times, then it's answered.FEMALE VOICEHello?STACYHello... is Mike there?FEMALE VOICEHold on.

Stacy sags, disbelieving, and looks at the clock on
the kitchen wall. It's getting late...FEMALE VOICE (CONT'D)He says he's helping his father in
	the garage and he'll call you back.

Stacy is stunned.FEMALE VOICE (CONT'D)Hello?

Stacy hangs up. She punches out another number,
quickly.MRS. BARRETT (V.O.)Hello?STACYHi, Mrs. Barrett. Is Linda there?MRS. BARRETT (V.O.)She went off to the beach. She'll
	be back later, though.STACYOkay. Thanks.

the driveway.STACY (CONT'D)Brad! Hey, wait a second!

She runs out.EXT. CRUISING VESSEL - AFTERNOONBrad and Stacy pull up next to the flea market.STACYYeah. This is it. I have some
	shopping to do.BRADSee you later.STACYThanks a lot, Brad. I really
	appreciate it.

She gets out of the car.EXT. FLEA MARKETStacy Hamilton watches her brother drive away. Then
she looks to both sides, and walks on. She passes
the entrance to the Flea Market. She walks around
the corner to another building marked BIRTH CONTROL
- FREE CLINIC. Brad follows her in the rearview
mirror.INT. BIRTH CONTROL CLINICStacy is lying in bed wearing a paper dress. Her
hair is stuffed in paper shower cap. She looks
anxious. In a bed next to her an older girl is
being affectionate with her visiting boyfriend.

A Nurse comes in with an IV.NURSEThis is going to prick a little.

She sticks the needle into Stacy's hand. Stacy
looks pained but doesn't yell. The Nurse pats the
rolling bed.NURSE (CONT'D)Now scoot over here.

Stacy moves onto it. Looking up from her point of
view, we see the ride out of the room and into:INT. OPERATING ROOMStacy gets wheeled in. The Doctor looks down at
her.DOCTORHello, Stacy, I'm Doctor Bartell.

Stacy moves onto the operating table as the Nurse
and Doctor get ready.DOCTOR (CONT'D)Any questions before we begin?STACYThis is going to hurt, isn't it?DOCTORWe'll use a local but you'll feel
	some pressure. It doesn't last that
	long.STACYDoes it hurt more to have a baby?

The Doctor pauses and considers her question.DOCTORYes... but I think you mind it
	less.

Stacy looks up at the lights and listens to the
sound of suction tubes.INT. B.C. WAITING AREAThe other girl and Stacy sit at a table eating
toast and jelly. The girl is reading. The Nurse
enters.NURSEHow are we doing in here? Debbie,

	let you go unless you have a ride

The Nurse studies her, decides she's telling the
truth and allows her to leave.EXT. ENTRANCE TO THE FREE CLINICStacy walks back out into the sunlight, slowly and
weakly. She is surprised and amazed at who she sees
standing outside, waiting for her.ANGLE ON BRAD HAMILTONHe stands, hands on hips, just outside the door.STACYBrad!

He puts an arm around her and leads her toward his
waiting car.BRADSince when do you shop at the Flea
	Market anyway?STACYBrad. Please don't tell Mom and
	Dad...

He helps her into the cruising vessel. He starts up
the car and drives off.BRADWho did it?

Stacy stares out the window. Tears well in her
eyes.BRAD (CONT'D)You're not going to tell me, are
	you?STACYNo.BRADAll right, then. It's your secret.

Stacy smiles at Brad. Brad smiles back. The car
drives on.INT. LINDA'S ROOM - NIGHTStacy is in Linda's room, sitting on her bed. Her
eyes are red and moist from crying. Linda listens
to her story.STACYI really thought he would show up.

Stacy lies back on the bed.EXT. DAMONE HOUSE - MORNINGThe front door to the Damone house opens, and out
walks Mike Damone carrying some books. He looks
troubled, burdened, and stares down at the walkway
as he moves towards his car. He walks around,
starts to pen the car door, then he sees it. There,
in white spray paint across the driver's door, is
the message: PRICK.DAMONEShhhhhhhhhit.

He looks both ways, and starts back towards the
house.EXT. DAMONE CARMike Damone travels down Ridgemont Drive, making
the turn into the school parking lot. There is a
large cardboard panel taped on the side of his car.EXT. DAMONE'S LOCKERHe arrives at his locker, where, in white spray
paint, there is another message: LITTLE PRICK.
Several girls walk by, they laugh knowingly.GIRL #1Hi, Mike!GIRL #2Hi, mike!

Damone backs up against the locker, with a sick
smile on his face.DAMONEHi... girls.

More students pass, looking strangely at the young
man pinned against his own locker.EXT. BOY'S LOCKER ROOM - AFTERNOONDamone exits the boys locker room. Just as he does,
he is accosted by The Rat. We have never quite
heard this tone in The Rat's voice before.THE RATDamone? What happened between you
	and Stacy?

Damone feigns The Attitude, shakes his head. Damone
sighs.DAMONELet me tell you something, Rat.
	Sometimes girls just go haywire. It
	was a month ago, I've been trying
	to think of a way to tell you ever
	since. We started messing around
	and... 
		(shrugs)
	... something happened. It's all
	over with. It's no big deal. I
	never called her again.

The Rat says nothing.DAMONE (CONT'D)If you ask me, she's pretty
	aggressive. You understand what I'm
	saying?THE RATNo Damone. I don't understand.DAMONEShe wasn't really your girlfriend
	anyway.THE RATHey fuck you Damone. There's a lot
	of girls out there and you mess
	around with Stacy. What have you
	got to prove?DAMONEJesus. I'm sorry.THE RATI always stick up for you. Whenever
	people say 'Aw, that Damone is a
	loudmouth' -- and they say that a
	lot -- I say 'You just don't know
	Damone.' When someone says you're
	an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not
	an idiot. You just don't know him.'
	Well, you know, Damone, maybe they
	do know you pretty good. And I'm
	just finding out.DAMONEFine. Get lost.

Damone starts to push past him, but The Rat shoves
his shoulder hard.DAMONE (CONT'D)All right, Rat. You want to do
	something about it?

Damone begins the classic high school fighting
ritual. He throws his books down. He takes a step
back. He goes into a crouch. He gestures towards
himself. Then Damone says the universally
recognized high school fighting words.DAMONE (CONT'D)Well come on.

The Rat shows no fear. As other kids begin to crowd
around the two boys, Rat throws his own books down.
He takes a step back, goes into the crouch. He
gestures toward himself.THE RATYou come on.

They stand there, gesturing, neither one of them
wanting to make the first move.DAMONENo. You come on, you wuss.

Assistant Coach Mr. Sexton comes running out of the
boy's locker room, and steps in front of the two
boys.SEXTONHey! Knock this crap off!!

The Rat stalks off, disappearing into the crowd of
onlookers.DISSOLVETO:EXT. RIDGEMONT DRIVE - NIGHTThe Ridgemont Drive strip is filled with cars,
cruising for parties. There is a lot of honking,
and yelling out windows. Everyone is headed towards
the beach. We stay on a lowly 7-11 store near the
freeway entrance.EXT. 7-11 STORE - NIGHTA yellow Firebird slowly, menacingly cruises the
empty parking lot. It does not stop.

Then, around the corner, walks Jeff Spicoli. We see
him in the neon 7-11 light, his hands stuffed deep
into the pockets of baggy jeans. He walks inside
the store. He is the only shopper.INT. 7-11 STOREBrad Hamilton stands behind the counter in a red
and white striped shirt and cap, making fresh
coffee. Jeff Spicoli trudges up to the counter. He
looks at Brad. Brad looks at Spicoli. There is an
unspoken edge between them.SPICOLIHey, mon, can I use the bathroom?

Brad squints his eyes, looks at the sign on the
back room door.ANGLE ONsign which reads: Rest Room For Employees Only.BRADGo ahead. Just make it quick.SPICOLITotally.BRADIt's the first door on your left.

Spicoli disappears into the back room. Brad sighs,
looks at the clock. It reads: 11:15. Then he hears
Spicoli from the back room.SPICOLI (O.S.)I can't find it, mon!BRADIt's the first door on your left!SPICOLI (O.S.)On the ledge?BRADFirst door on your left!SPICOLI (O.S.)There it is!

Brad sighs again. He loads a new filter into the
coffee maker.EXT./INT. 7-11 STOREA moment later, the yellow Firebird pulls into the
7-11 parking lot. A man in a windbreaker comes
hurtling out of the car, into the store. He spray
paints the scanning camera above the door. He
hustles up to the counter, produces a .45 Magnum
and points it chest high at Brad. There is a glazed
and nervous speedy edge to his voice.ROBBERI want money. And I want it all --
	now.

Brad looks pale and young under the fluorescent 7
11 light.

He speaks slowly.BRADThey empty and close the big safe
	here at midnight.ROBBER(getting tougher)
	I know this store. I know where the
	safe is.

He bangs the gun on the counter, hard.ROBBER (CONT'D)Over there behind the donut case.
	Now move!

Brad slowly moves to the donut case, like a zombie.BRADI'm instructed to tell you that we
	are on a video alarm system and
	there are other hidden cameras in
	the store ...ROBBERJust give me the money. Move it.BRADOkay.

	I just started here, and they just
	taught me the procedure. I'll give
	you the money, just let me figure
	this out.ROBBER(very menacing)
	Move it. Move it.

Brad opens the phony back of the donut case and
fiddles with the strongbox combination.ROBBER (CONT'D)(more menacing)
	Let's go, stupid.

Brad looks at the gunman.BRADYou motherfucker. Get off my
	fuckin' case.

The Robber is about to react when the bathroom door
opens and Jeff Spicoli starts out, wiping his hands
on his pants.SPICOLINo towels, mon...

The Robber turns to look at Spicoli, and that is
all that Brad Hamilton needs. Just like it is the
most natural thing in the world, Brad reaches for
the hot, steaming coffee pot he has just made and
throws it into the gunman's face and hands.ROBBERAaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrr!!!

The .45 falls out of his hand and rattles to the
floor. The gunman is still grabbing his face, and
looking at his skinless hands in horror when Brad
snaps up the gun. In the parking lot, the gunman's
accomplice, poised behind the wheel of the yellow
Firebird, spots the foul-up and screeches out of
the parking lot.BRADThere goes your ride home.

Brad pulls the under-counter alarm with newfound
confidence. Jeff Spicoli stands there, mesmerized
at the entire event.SPICOLIAwesome. Totally awesome.EXT. RIDGEMONT MALL - NIGHTKids are pouring into the Ridgemont mall. Summer
banners are already up.INT. THE MALL - NIGHTIn the midst of all the kids and shoppers, we see
The Rat walking slowly down the promenade. He is
wearing an Army surplus jacket, and his hands are
buried deep in his pockets. 

Two girls pass his way. One smiles briefly at him,
and The Rat turns to watch her pass. He is about to
say something to her, then no. He walks on, sees
Swenson's Ice-Cream Parlor up ahead. The Rat
decides to walk the other way.INT. SWENSON'S - NIGHTThe place is busy again, filled with shoppers and
teenagers in summer-type clothing.

	cleaned B-8. Give me a break.STACYGet going.

The two girls smile, go back to their posts.INT. JEFF SPICOLI'S ROOM - NIGHTJeff Spicoli sits in his room, and it is his
castle. Clothes lie in disarray on the floor. A
huge half-waxed surfboard is propped against the
window. We see Spicoli dressed in a too large white
short-sleeved shirt, attempting to tie his father's
fat paisley tie. He stops to take a hit from his
bong, all the while talking on the phone. The music
of Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Freebird" plays on the radio.SPICOLII... am... so... wasted, mon. What
	is in this shit?

	Doesn't that stuff cause brain

Spicoli hangs up, and concentrates on tying his
tie. He almost strangles himself. Then suddenly the
door to his room flies open and Spicoli's little
brother Curtis bursts in.CURTISJeff you have company!SPICOLIGo away, Curtis. If you can't
	knock, I can't hear you.

Curtis slams the door and leaves. A moment later
there is a knock.SPICOLI (CONT'D)That's better. Come in.

The door swings open and Jeff Spicoli sits in
stoned shock at the sight before him. There,
standing in the doorway of his room is Mr. Hand.SPICOLI (CONT'D)Mr... Mr. Hand.MR. HANDThat's right, Jeff. Mind if I come
	in?

Spicoli can only nod.MR. HAND (CONT'D)(calling downstairs)
	Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Spicoli.

Hand walks into Spicoli's room, takes off his suit
jacket and lays it on the chair back. He stops a
moment and catches the stare of Miss January
Penthouse on the wall, then turns to Spicoli.MR. HAND (CONT'D)Were you going somewhere tonight,
	Jeff?SPICOLIYeah. The Graduation Dance Mr.
	Hand. It's the last school event of
	the year.MR. HANDI'm afraid we've got some things to
	discuss here, Jeff.SPICOLIDid I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?

Hand removes several copies of Oui Magazine from
another chair and sits down. He sets his briefcase
on Spicoli's dresser, next to a bag of pot, and
opens it up for easy access.MR. HANDDo you want to sit there, Jeff?SPICOLII don't know. I guess so.MR. HANDFine. You sit right here on your

	since the very beginning of the
	school year -- I don't like to
	spend my time waiting for late
	students, or detention cases. I'd
	rather be preparing the lesson.

Mr. Hand takes a sheet from his briefcase and looks
at it.MR. HAND (CONT'D)According to my calculations, Mr.
	Spicoli, you wasted a total of
	eight hours of my time this year.
	And rest assured that is a kind
	estimate.

He returns the sheet to his case and looks into
Spicoli's weed-ravaged eyes.MR. HAND (CONT'D)Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare
	moment for me. Now I have the
	unique pleasure of squaring our
	account. Tonight, you and I are

Mr. Hand pauses a moment, then breaks into the
nearest approximation of a grin we have seen all
year. It isn't much, but it's noticeable. His lips
crinkle at the ends.MR. HANDDon't worry, Spicoli. You'll
	probably squeak by.SPICOLIAll right! Oh, yeah!

Mr. Hand has now gathered all his material, and he
stands to approach Spicoli's door. Jeff jumps up,
extends his hand.SPICOLI (CONT'D)Aloha, Mr. Hand!MR. HANDAloha, Spicoli.

of the Spicoli household. Spicoli kicks the door
shut, grins, and continues struggling with his tie.INT. RIDGEMONT GYMNASIUM - NIGHTTight angle on the emotion-filled face of the lead

last verse of The Eagles' 'Take It To The Limit'.

We pull back to reveal a large, clumsy banner
reading: LAST DANCE. Students are pouring into the
gym for this event. Many have brought their annual
yearbooks. On stage, the lead singer snaps his
fingers and the band goes into Nick Lowe's 'Heart
of the City'. Some students start to dance.

Every one of our characters is either here, or
about to arrive. From Charles Jefferson to Spicoli
to Mr. Hand. For once, all classes are partying
together. But, just as in the beginning of the year

into their distinctive cliques.ANGLE ON MORE STUDENTS ARRIVINGat the Last Dance. They see Mr. Hand signing

Spicoli slips the annual into the kid's crotch. The
stoner winces in pain, but still opens the book and
lingers on all the signings in Spicoli's annual.
They are all drug-related messages from fellow
stoners. After a moment, Spicoli's friend signs:
"Thanks for the reds. Todd."TODDHey, mon, good thing we're going to

"It Won't Be Long".

We see Brad's old girlfriend Lisa push up to him.
Her new jock boyfriend holds a protective arm
around her.LISAI saw your picture in the paper.
	You had the greatest look on your
	face!ANOTHER STUDENTFront of the Metro Section. I'm
	telling my parents, 'I know this
	guy, I know this guy.'

Lisa's boyfriend pulls his arm tighter around her.LISAWill you sign my annual, Brad?

Brad smiles, nods. He signs, and gives her his. We
then see Brad's three Buddies from Carl's Jr. come
up, pat him on the back and grab his shoulder. Brad
studies them warily.BUDDY #1Fuckin' manager of 7-11!BUDDY #2Get us jobs over there, Brad! You
	can do it!BRADSince when do you guys want to work
	at 7-11?BUDDY #2Come on, Brad! It would be great!
	All of us together!BRADWell, 7-11 is a tremendous

	we're gone from Carl's, Brad.BUDDY #2Yeah, man, all the little punks
	from junior high have taken over
	the place.

Brad leaves his old buddies. He grins and notices
someone across the crowded dance floor.BRADHey, Thompson! Wendell! Get a job!

They laugh, flip him off. Brad is back in his
element at last. He moves into the main dancing
area, works his way across the room, past the
bleachers, when he hears a voice.SPICOLI (O.S.)Hamilton!

Brad turns around, seen Spicoli sitting on the
bottom rung of the bleachers. Spicoli looks back
with true respect.SPICOLI (CONT'D)Awesome.

He throws Brad his annual. Brad gives him his. They
sign.SPICOLI (CONT'D)Easy, mon.BRADLater.ANGLE ON THE BLEACHERSwhere several couples are passionately making out.
Four teachers clomp up into the stands from
different angles. They pin the couples in
flashlight beams, like the main tower pinning an
escaping prisoner.ANGLE ON THE T-BIRDSonstage, singing the Rolling Stones' "I'm Free".EXT. GYNMASIUM - NIGHTWe see Jeff Spicoli leave the dance and come
backing down the stairs with a stoner bud. His fist
is in the air.SPICOLISummer, mon! We're there!

He turns to his stoner bud.SPICOLI (CONT'D)Let's roll, my man.

Spicoli backs right into a young buzz-cut kid.SPICOLI (CONT'D)Hey, bud! Watch yourselff

Spicoli turns around to see he's backed into a
squad of eight Lincoln Surf Nazis. They are all
standing on the steps, waiting.SURF NAZIAre you Jeff Spicoli?

Spicoli looks up and down the row of Surf Nazis. On
the end, he sees L.C.L.C.That's him! He did it!SPICOLIHey, mon, I don't know what your
	trip is, but...

Spicoli dashes off down Luna Street. L.C. and the
Surf Nazis take out in hot pursuit, chasing him
through the parking lot, past Ridgemont High, and
into the night. They will never catch him.SLOWDISSOLVE:INT. RIDGEMONT MALLSchool is out and it's summer business as usual at
the Ridgemont Mall. We see the same stores, the
same packs of kids roaming the three tiers.ANGLE ON MARK RATNERwho stands against the railing in his Cinema Four
jacket, gazing across the mall at Swenson's Ice
Cream Parlor. He sees Stacy walk two girlfriends to
the outdoor front tables, and almost look his way.
The Rat turns away suddenly. Then he hears her
calling out after him.STACYHey Mark! Turn around!

Ratner turns around, affects total and complete
cool. He waves across the mall to her.STACY (CONT'D)Come over here!

He looks back at his post at the theatre, decides
it's okay to step away. He walks across the mall.INT. SWENSON'SStacy is standing by the sundae bar. Next to her
are two empty stools. After a moment, we see The
Rat plop onto one of the metal stools. He pounds
the seat next to him with the palm of his hand.THE RATYou. Sit.

Stacy turns to look at him, smiles. She sits.STACYHi, Mark.THE RATHi, Stacy. How are you?STACYI'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you
	came over here because I want you
	to know something. I just thought I
	would tell you that I really
	enjoyed getting to know you this
	year.

The Rat maintains The Attitude.THE RATYeah? About fifty people I didn't
	know wrote that in my annual.STACYI know everybody says it, but I
	really mean it.

The Rat looks at her from the corner of his eyes.THE RATReally?STACYYeah. I want you to have this
	picture, so you won't forget what I
	look like. And so you'll remember
	to call me over the summer.

She withdraws a picture from her pocket, hands it
to The Rat.THE RATWell, I don't know, I may be doing
	some traveling this summer. I don't
	know how much I'll be around... 
		(breaks down, takes
		picture)
	But I'll give you a call sometime.STACYI'd like that.

She gives him a kiss on the mouth, gets up and
walks away. The Rat sits there, smiling at the way
things sometimes turn out. He slips the picture
into his pocket, a satisfied young man.INT./EXT. SWENSON'S AND MALLThe Rat is joined by Mike Damone, who has changed
into his street clothes.DAMONEShe wants it, Rat.

The Rat snickers, shakes his head.DAMONE (CONT'D)I saw you. You had pure Attitude.

The Rat turns to look at his friend.THE RATThe Attitude, Damone, is only good
	until you meet the right girl.DAMONEWhatever you say, Rat.

They take off together, blending into the crowd of
kids walking the mall.THE RATAnd... you can only tell it's the
	right girl if you're sensitive.DAMONESensitive -- what is that?THE RATSensitive is when you can tell how
	people feel without asking.DAMONESo what makes you so sensitive?THE RATWell, for one, I read. I don't
	watch as much television as you.

	learning a lot about people.DAMONEWhat do you read? What's the last
	book you read?THE RATLust For Life. It's the story of
	Vincent Van Gough.DAMONE(scoffs)

	must mean I'm sensitive too.THE RATIt's a way, Damone. It's a vibe. I
	put it out, and I have personally
	found that girls do respond.

Damone laughs, shoves him hard. We lose sight of
the two boys in the sea of kids.A SERIES OF ANGLESof Ridgemont Center Mall with music.CREDITSFADE TOBLACKTHE END
