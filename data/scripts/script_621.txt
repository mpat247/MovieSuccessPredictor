               One Inspector takes a crowbar and yanks out several strips 
               of plywood, REVEALING unmarked cardboard boxes inside. The 
               other Inspector pulls out one of the boxes and tears it open.

               It is filled with tomatoes. He takes a bite out of one.

               Nods. Everything seems to be order. The Captain looks 
               relieved. The inspector closes the cardboard box but...

               Watch carefully now, because as he does this, he hits a power 
               button on a small HOMING DEVICE and stuffs it in with the

               explosive primer to the hull of the ship.INT. HUMVEE (MOVING) - NIGHTPlowing through thick brush that breaks out onto a secluded 
               beach. Handsome Rob is still behind the wheel but now Steve 
               is in the passenger seat. Lyle, in the back, is still on the 
               laptop, legs fidgeting like a drummer on meth. POP goes his

               Half-Ear grabs onto the bottom rung of a ladder that is bolted 
               to the side of the ship as it launches off the dock and into 
               deeper water.CUT TO:TWO BRIGHT CIRCLES IN A SEA OF DARKNESSComing closer... becoming clearer... It's Charlie and John 
               Bridger, in scuba gear, riding torpedo-shaped Dive Propulsion 
               Vehicles (DPVs) that pull them through the deep blue sea at 
               a good 5 m.p.h. Both DPVs drag equipment bags.

               A Global Satellite Positioning Device is mounted on the 
               handlebar of Charlie's DPV, being fed information via Lyle's 
               laptop. A circle pulsates on the monitor, a beacon to the 
               crate in the ship.EXT. UNDER THE BOAT - NIGHTHalf-Ear still clings to the ladder. It's a wild ride.

               Through the headset inside his gear, he HEARS:LYLE (V.O.)Get ready. 3. 2. 1. Drop.

               Half-Ear lets go of the ladder. The ship's propellers speed 
               by just above his head. WHOOSH.

               He removes a radio-controlled detonator. Hits the button.EXT. SHIP - ON THE CUTThe hull of the boat EXPLODES.INT. SHIP'S HOLDA very neat hole on the bottom of the boat beneath the crate

               the bay through infrared binoculars.

               The ship is going down. The crew on the dingy head back to 
               the port, which is in the opposite direction of this beach.EXT. THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA - NIGHTThe DPVs are now attached by a tether to an underwater lifting 
               bag that is used to move heavy loads through water.

               The crate is surrounded by our three diver-bandits.

               Using crowbars they pull apart the plywood. The cardboard 
               boxes of tomatoes dump out, tomatoes spilling everywhere.

               And now we see what was hidden between the boxes...

               A large safe.

               They move like clock-work. Half-Ear aims an underwater light 
               at the dial. Charlie drills a small hole near the dial.

               John peers inside a horoscope and lines up the three wheels 
               of the combination lock... until the door pops open.

               As they stare at what's inside, they speak into their

               And now we see the contents of the safe: 160 glistening GOLD 
               BRICKS. Made in Singapore, they weigh 25 pounds and each one 
               is decorated with the face of an exotic Balinese girl. We're 
               talking thirty million dollars worth of gold.INT. HUMVEE (PARKED) - NIGHTThey holler and high-five and it's just a great moment to be 
               alive. Steve takes another peek through his infrared 
               binoculars and sees --

               The last vestiges of the ship hang above the waterline, then 
               disappear.EXT. UNDERWATER - A LITTLE LATERThe gold is now stacked and secured on the lifting bag.

               They attach an underwater parachute to the bag and hook a 
               hose from an air tank into press of a pressure release valves 
               which cause the parachute to INFLATE.

               Looking like a hot-air balloon underwater, the whole thing 
               floats up about fifteen feet. Half-Ear holds onto its side, 
               going along for the ride.

               Then Charlie and John Bridger speed off on the DPVs which 
               are tethered to the inflatable bag. As they glide through

               Handsome Rob and Steve are still up front. The others are in 
               the back seats, the divers out of their scuba gear. They are 
               pouring champagne into paper cups; except for Bridger who 
               abstains. He holds up his empty cup.JOHN BRIDGERMy name is John and I'm a very rich

               They laugh and pound their fists against the roof of the
